I think its lower than that like 120 now and my uneven profile and schizophrenia and dp/dr (sensory overload) makes work impossible. i think i have trauma but it might all be in my head. its real to me though."

176032609,"Keep us posted. I will be intrigued to see if the research works in animal models where they use a different method, rather than this specific genetic mutation. What if most people with SZ don’t have that mutation? If they can get down to the level of testing people and making a specific reccomendation because they know it’ll help because you have mutation, that would be good."

If I’m out and about, I sit down, and focus on my breathing. If you drink caffeine, stop. If you smoke, stop. If you drink energy drinks, stop. Remember, you control YOU. While you may have uncontrolled panic attacks, with tools, you can shorten the duration. I hope this helps you. I’m just sharing what works, for me. Talk to your therapist about which workbooks can help you. Take care."

176032630,"While I love the forum I will say that if you’re experiencing more severe symptoms then you need to talk to your treatment team. Its helpful to talk things out and get a different perspective from people who have gone through something similar, but there are some damaging things said here from time to time and some issues just need professional moderation. Basically I treat this forum as a place to ask questions to get ideas. I always use information given to me as a good springboard to ask my treatment team, but in no way should it be used in place of treatment. This forum is good for support most of the time, especially if someone doesn’t have too many people IRL, but people can only do so much over a forum. Being proactive with one’s treatment team goes a long way towards recovery."

176032673,Yeah they’ll bite you still. People like to talk about themselves. You can do well socially if you focus on what people are saying and remember what they say. _AT_MENTION_ years ago made a great post that I remember about remembering what type of coffee people like. You know a person likes milk and two sugars they respect that. It makes them appreciate that you know something about them and that is half the battle!
176032674,I know part of it is because of recent events. I’ve been struggling with the deaths of a couple residents who I took care of and cared about. Last night a close friend had a seizure out of nowhere and it really scared me. It still does scare me. Time is another factor. When I had psychotic symptoms my hallucinations would be the worst right when I would try to go to bed and fall asleep. Even now I still go through phases where my anxiety skyrockets when I try to go to bed and fall asleep. I dont experience hallucinations but my body’s panic response certainly remembers them. So the ramblings above are essentially pure anxiety. At least an expression of it. I’m doing a little better today. I’ll probably go downhill some again at night.
176032675,I was on lithium for like 5 years. Tolerated it well. It helped me

176032683,its like any other disorder that needs meds your not alone (well you are in your own mind) (except for subconscious vocal thoughts) which are not really anything because they are just thoughts in your mind but in reality we are personally alone but we have people in the outer world focus on the outside of your mind we are all alone inside of ourselves but we are not alone outside of ourselves and finding comfort in that is important

And the longest ball I ever hit was a foul ball (but hey! it did go a long ways). I found my niche was pitching, though you wouldn’t have known it from my first outing. Hit the first four batters I faced before being yanked from the game. I got better though, and by the time I was in the 7th grade, I was hitting the mid-70s. Never did anything with baseball after that, though. The pitching was great for arm and elbow strength…until I blew my right elbow out warming up too quickly. Story of my life…get good at something and have the rug yanked out from under. Oh well, I wasn’t going to be on any major league team anyway. It was nice to dream…"

My dreams can be really vivid and disrupts my sleep. This doesn’t happen during the day. I have anxiety and a low mood at times though. I keep busy, but still don’t feel myself.

176032750,I haven’t been on here for a while and missed you guys. Just thought I’d share my latest… My sza continues to be under control and I haven’t been depressed for at least two or three months now. Been reading and discussing veganism with a good friend who made the transition. Also re-read the China Study by _NAME_ and _NAME_ and did some research on factory farming. It was something I was aware of in the past - I went vegan for one month several years ago. But it came up again and I have decided to return to a vegan diet and only have dairy and eggs when it’s unavoidable like at others houses etc. I cannot support an industry that abuses animals in such shocking ways. Imagine your newborn baby being taken away from you forever - over and over again. Well that’s what happens to dairy cows. The list goes on. I want to be a lover and respecter of nature and care for others out there. The journey is exciting. I’ve rediscovered my career of being a writer. I only hope to share with others all 
the good I learned and hope that my sza will not return to destroy my new found enthusiasm. Let me make hay while the sun shines!

174350158,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A 1.5-Year Longitudinal Study of Social Activity in Patients With Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Patients with schizophrenia exhibit impairments in their social activity, intelligence quotient (IQ), daily living skills, and social function. Social activity is a high-order outcome measure of their lives. Here we attempted to longitudinally evaluate the effects of IQ, daily living skills, social function, psychiatric symptoms, and medications on social activity in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of the current study is to identify the specific factor that affects longitudinal changes in social activity. Sixty-five patients with schizophrenia were assessed at two time points [time 2 (T2, follow-up) - time 1 (T1, baseline) = 1.71 ± 0.79 years]. Social activity, IQ, daily living skills, and social function were assessed using the Social Activity Assessment (SAA; h/week), short for
m of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III (WAIS-SF), University of California San _NAME_ (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA), and Social Functioning Scale (SFS), respectively. IQ, daily living skills, social function, and social activity were significantly improved between T1 and T2 (t = 2.0-4.4, p = 0.048-3.60 × 10-5). IQ, daily living skills, and social function positively correlated with social activity (lowest p = 1.27 × 10-5), and psychiatric symptoms negatively correlated with social activity over time (lowest p = 3.26 × 10-9). The longitudinal change in social activity was independently and positively correlated with a change in social function (beta = 0.35, p = 4.63 × 10-3), particularly interpersonal communication (beta = 0.35, p = 4.32 × 10-3). The longitudinal changes in other factors did not directly affect the change in social activity (p > 0.05). Based on these findings, social activity is more affected by social function than by other factors. My offline social ac

It was a game show hosted by a guy named _NAME_ who was a former speech writer for _NAME_ and a very smart guy. _NAME_ had a tiny part in “Mask” starring _NAME_ and also played a teacher in “_NAME_ Buellers Day Off”. Anyways, _NAME_ was _NAME_ sidekick and his specialty was putting people down with mean comments, insults, and jokes. In the seventies it was called “ranking” someone, in the eighties we called in “capping” on someone.

I chose going to sleep at 12:00 pm so I would have the morning to run errands and take care of business. But it took quite an adjustment to these hours and I never really got comfortable doing it especially because I was living with seven other roommates who kept different hours and made noise throughout the day or knocked on my door for something occasionally. I always thought working graveyard would be cool but it was actually a pain in the ass. WTH anyways, I ended up getting fired for not showing up three days in a row and not calling."

176032917,"I’ve been in a few group homes. When I first got sick at age 19 I spent a year in one. It was a world famous, experimental home for schizophrenics called Soteria House. Their tenet was that they could help schizophrenics recover better without medication or being hospitalized. So they rented a few homes around the world in community’s and staffed them with counselors who had no experience or education in psychology but they were picked for being young and friendly and open-minded and likable. They claimed a higher success rate than hospitals but that was debated on both sides, by the critics and themselves. I was there 1980-81. It was a trippy place. There were few rules; no drugs or alcohol and no violence were the main rules. Other than that you could act how you want. I have to say, the experience didn’t help me at all. I was psychotic and going out of my mind the whole time I was there. I was pretty much a loner. I was friendly with other clients but only made a couple of friends during m
y stay. There were 5 or 6 of us and about 5 regular counselors. I think the counselors were more helped by us, than us by them. The counselors were pretty screwed up for the most part and took sides and fought among themselves. It was an experience, not one I would like to go through again. I could tell some stories about it for sure. They closed down most of the houses in about 1984 though I think there’s still one in Norway and another in Switzerland. I ran up a bill for rent in the thousands but since I couldn’t handle working while I was there I had no way of paying and they ended up not charging me a cent for rent."

For me what was helpful was writing both sides of the debate in my head. I came to the conclusion the fact I’m having voices is evidence that I may really be sick.

I have researched it and expect it, but still try to overcome it. It has aged me, the antipsychotics I think, my skin got saggy and I really show my age now, this is hard on me too because it happens so fast. At what age were u diagnosed? Do you hear voices? I don’t hear them much anymore"
176032995,"Just stop smoking weed. It might trigger these symptoms off, but generally speaking it will just make them worse. You have to accept like I did that if you get psychosis, chances are your weed smoking days are over."

176033014,You are doing the best you can do. You just need as much support as you can get and to keep talking yourself out of the delusions the best you can.

174350183,"The schizophrenic spectrum Schizophrenia-like conditions can occur without hallucinations and delusions — that is, with only negative and cognitive symptoms. One term for these conditions that has fallen out of fashion is simple schizophrenia. Newer terms, as listed in the American Psychiatric Association diagnostic manual, are schizotypal personality and schizoid personality. Both these disorders involve discomfort with or incapacity for social relations, apparent indifference to others, and emotional inexpressiveness — classic schizophrenia symptoms. Schizotypal personality disorder also implies eccentric to bizarre beliefs, habits, and appearance. Schizophrenia in its earliest stages, before the first psychotic break, sometimes looks exactly like schizotypal personality.

176033025,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes it is… "" ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains, and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream, and butter."" At first glance high fat seems unhealthy, but if you have it in nuts I wouldn’t be so scared. But it is daunting."
176033026,I’m sorry that happened to you _NAME_. I think I said mine was pretty mild compared to what others have gone through. It’s nice to know you are not alone.
176033027,"Yes, yes, yes! I love this song also!"
176033028,By friends yes but not family. Though I made 3 new friends after my sz who know that I am schizo. They’re chill with it. We video chat and play video games everyday.
174350202,It’s probably a good thing this has yet to be commented on. I was thinking of something worse to fictionalize like someone locating where in the body the Invega or whatever the drug is was stored and extracting it another way through surgery or something more sinister. Maybe no one will give that a mention. I hate the side effects of Invega too but have no question that psychosis is not something to mess with. So they never put me on Invega _PERSON_. But I’ve noticed some folks have gotten desperate to avoid the next shot. (the newest form of noncompliance I suppose is to not appear at the doctor’s office again.) I do wish they worked more on better drugs rather then the injections If you saw more schizophrenics who had been taking their meds for years who were in good health you probably would reconsider noncompliance. I hope there are new and better drugs in the next 28 years which is about the time I have had schizophrenia.

176033033,The Circle Good movie on secrets
176033034,Meds are important. For serious symptoms they really can make a difference. I too would recommend seeing a psychiatrist if possible. Labels really do change for most of us who use this site. It really is about function…if all these symptoms are affecting function then it’s an issue that needs addressing. If it’s affecting your living then diagnosis is more important simply for treatment.
176033035,That’s great. What negatives do you have?
176033036,the shot? Did invega make you twitch?

The voices are of a nature reflective of your mental state. Deep stress manifests deeply stressed voices. Comfortable happiness manifests happier voices, and the very next level realizations that can change your life for the better. You can’t will the comfortable happiness though, it’s a physiological mechanism. Praying it better is lottery odds that you’ll be lead to the right treatment given the current understanding of schizophrenia."
176033040,"I didn’t knw there was a word for what I experience a lot, experiencing right now. Before my psychosis started I just completely lost the ability to do things, especially cooking and cleaning. Everything had way too many steps and I just couldn’t get myself to do it, and if I tried I would just end up crying and shaking. I think it’s starting to pass though but man it’s made getting homework done soo difficult, along with attention span issues."
176033041,Don’t worry about it. Crying shows that you are human!
176033042,About nine months. Didn’t work out very well and my wife was not happy with me.
174350199,I drink coffee everyday. I tried to quit but with the groggy side effects of my medication it was very difficult. If I drink too much it exacerbates my positive symptoms. If I drink 1~3 cups a day it seems to be okay and gives me energy.

176033048,It depends on the teacher. Some teachers are powercrazed and disrespectful and unprofessional so they say you are not welcome in their yoga class unless you salute them. I want to do yoga class but the instructor has made me feel that I am not welcome so I have not been going. I really miss yoga. I used to go to yoga class once a week. My belief is that no one is superior to me. Hope my best friends in spirit and I are cool about this so we can stay best friends. Maybe that’s one reason I don’t seem to have any friends irl. My mum is a yoga instructor but she does not work as one but she could if she wanted to. She does yoga every single morning. Glad you are enjoying your yoga.
176033049,"I have several. I ran the balance up on a couple of them into the thousands on stupid stuff and so I gave them to my sister to hold for safekeeping so I won’t rack up and more debt.

I’m still spending on advertisement. It looks like I’ll run a once a month box ad in the town newspaper on the Family Page. I learned in that webinar to narrow my target audience, and with this one, I’m going for the aging, or those who are temporarily or permanently limited in mobility. _NAME_ acts like this is some kind of pipe dream that isn’t happening. Well no. Right Now _NAME_. See it to believe it. This is a job I was meant for all my life."
174350205,Abilify is the best generally in term of side effects because it is a partial agonist. I think at the end it depends on what side effects you subjectively get.

I loved the course, but the final project was ruined for me. Still, I was psychotic at the time, and lucky I found the strength to finish it. I got a 1st for that paper, despite not enjoying it as much as I could have done. I’d say go for it. You won’t regret getting an education. The transferable skills from Sociology will help a lot.

He went to school, went to work, went to bed, then started all over again. So why does he have to decide to be all chummy now? I don’t want this stupid virus, and I certainly don’t want my other kids or my husband- who has had a heart attack and a double bypass- to get it. He’s being irresponsible, and no matter how often consequences are explained to him, he dismisses them. I know part of it is his age, but I’m really, really frustrated with his cavalier attitude."

But you can debate about euthanasia for the mentally ill all you want. Seems a bit hypocritical maybe completely. It’s also a political opinion, and I thought politics weren’t on this forum either. Or is politics ok? It’s insane how people are so anal about free speech. I don’t post any of my conspiracy theories on here, or I try not to mostly because I’ll just be flagged or told I’m crazy for what I’ve experienced. It doesn’t help people. That’s why I prefer the facebook groups over this forum. It’s too heavily moderated. It makes me uncomfortable that every single keystroke I make is being recorded. Its creepy. Like having someone breathe down your neck for posting in a support group. I mentioned eugenics already once, but you can talk about it I guess because you’re a moderator, and that’s still a political thing or “triggering” because the label 
schizophrenia was created by the first “eugenicist” and it’s freaking true. So sue me for being honest! I’m sorry I’m so controversial. But this topic is stupid when suicide is the number one cause of death in someone with schizophrenia, not to mention homelessness, _USER_ID_, being feared as if you’re a monster. Why wouldn’t you take a more progressive stance on this? This forum is regressive, anyways, it sucks. I mean make it harder for me to leave why don’t you?"

My condition is really unstable; one day I feel better and think to myself “I can go for a walk to the city”, so I do, then when I’m there I all of a sudden experience huge anxiety and so my mood changes very often throughout the day or from day to day. How many injections have you had and when was your last one? Mostly a person should start to feel better after around 8 months or even fully recover after this time, but I read on a different forum that Invega Sustenna users (not Abilify Maintena, but it has a half-life of 49 days compared to our 46.5, so it’s similar) usually recover after around 12 months, some of them don’t recover until something like two years, so it depends on a person’s metabolism I guess…"

It just takes time and patience and hard work. If you stick around here you will see people with schizophrenia who are parents, or some people with schizophrenia go to school or work or travel or live independently or hike or go to movies etc. My theory is that most people have some kind of potential, you just have to find out what it is. Sometimes other people can see your potential even though you can’t see it in yourself. You’re going to run into problems your whole life because everybody does.

176033247,"i remember when i was getting bad and hearing voices, i was still trying to be a functional adult. driving and working. i got a job at amazon where i was picking product. all day for months i would walk up and down the aisles, hearing voices repeat my thoughts and i thought it was the voices of my co-workers. they were always telling me things like “relax” and “it’s not a big deal” and “it’s fine” trying to reassure me. after so much time i started to think that thought broadcasting is just an open secret and that it is possible to hear other people thoughts. oddly i took comfort in the thought i developed that it was not to be spoken of aloud and that not everyone could hear my thoughts just a select few, who probably hear worse thoughts. i found thought broadcasting to be much like tourrettes or something, where you try not to think anything negative and then by doing so, all this offensive stuff pops into your head. and then try not to think anything offensive, it’s brutal. but 
after enough time i got comfortable and my thoughts were more normal. that was the last job i worked, i made it 6 months there. it wasnt the thought broadcasting that made me quit, but the quota’s and boringness of the work."

176033277,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_, don’t expect weight loss changes any time too soon or you’ll set yourself up for disappointment and more comfort eating.

Will they appreciate me? I am a deranged, lost outcast, And there is not one place on Earth That will say, welcome, You are loved and welcome to stay. But soon the birds cry; The alligators, the beasts of the world, Hide away from your presence; Then you know, It’s time to run away. It’s the virus! It’s violence!

I eat a LOT of veggie stews and stuff like finger millet pudding mixed with banana is great for breakfast. Cooked Rice and potatoes are good carbs since the body does not quickly convert them to sugars. Brown breads are also good carbs. I also eat fruits like grapes, orange, banana, watermelon and apples. Nuts are good too. I rarely have processed sugar anymore but once a month i have heavy unhealthy meals like super cheesy nonveg pizza, fried meats etc. Tastes awesome!

The science backed way to make lifestyle changes that stick is to make little changes one at a time. My first goal is to cook myself 1 nutritious meal a day. Admittedly I have been struggling with that, but its a process and that is ok. I’m done constantly criticizing myself and beating myself up for not accomplishing these things on the first try.

176033376,"Women used to do it to me all the time. I mean regularly. I was shopping for an ice cube tray an hour ago and I walked by an attractive black woman wearing a low cut dress. I looked at her and she looked at me and we made eye contact. I should say here that she was built very nicely. When we got close she bent forward nicely and gave me glimpse of her uhh “herself”, lol. Oh man, it was so great and I played it cool and I looked but I didn’t stare and I walked on and and continued my shopping and saw her a couple more times and we both played dumb and just glanced at each other innocently. But man, it was such a turn-on. It used to happen to me all the time but slowly tapered off. Maybe if I pay attention more it might happen more."

I suffered terribly for a total of 33 years because the medication technology and information available to psychiatrists wasn’t advanced enough to help me until the year 2016 when my pdoc placed me on a total of three atypical antipsychotics at once. That was the year when all of my psychosis disappeared. I finally live a near normal life today."

176033392,"I love these!! I was just thinking I might do Christmas cards this year. I don’t usually, but after my dad died, I had the thought that I wanted to keep in touch with the rest of his family, who I’m not close with. It might be a good start. My dad interviewed _NAME_ for the student radio when he was in college. He told me about it a few months before he passed away. Now that I’m thinking about it, maybe I’ll steal your idea and do Peanuts cards. You really can’t go wrong."
176033393,"I was diagnosed with sza in 1994. I was 34 then. I am 60 now. I suffered with delusions, paranoia, thought insertion and thought broadcasting, delusions of reference, suicidal ideations, and manic episodes for 33 years. Now, all that is over due to AP meds. Now, I am only left with the residual symptoms of mumbling voices, musical hallucinations, visual hallucinations, mild cognitive impairment and amotivation."

176033397,"There was a bluegrass festival in CA during one of my visits but we didn’t go for some reason. I’d like to go to at least one musical one sometime. There’s really not much to do around here unless you catch the Metro to Washington DC. It’s 1:27 AM for me, I was up all night last night and slept for like 5 hours today on a couch from 3 to 8 pm. My schedule’s all messed up. Doing my regular thing which is where I run like two or three screens at once, a game, television, and the forum/youtube/netflix/hulu."
176033398,"I take a lot of supplements, I’m not worried about those since I can take breaks ftom them whenever I feel like it. The ap I’ve been on a real long time…I know it it’s not good for me in the long run, but I have a problem that requires me to take it. In a way I feel the ap’s are making me insane. Like how i view certain things has gone sideways. But still it’s a much lesser insanity than slipping into psychosis. I wish I could take M&M’s instead though."

176033401,"My son works at a fast food restaurant. We got him the job because we know the manager from eating there all the time. I have been thinking about working a few hours a week, and I called the manager to ask if he would hire for a certain shift Mon-Thurs. He said yes. I don’t want to work Fridays because my husband is always off, but I think I could work that four hour shift for those days. It pays $8 an hour, so it wouldn’t interfere with my disability, and I’ve worked in fast food before. It makes me feel kinda dumb because of my degrees and experience, but I can’t get a better job and risk losing disability because I can’t support myself full-time. The position I used to work at tends to pay $15-20/hr. so that is out of the question. I am not reliable, though. At all. I WANT to work, but can I? For those of you who do, how do you handle it? My husband’s student loans are now due, so we are losing a few hundred dollars a month, and we also need money for birthdays and Christmas as well 
as clothes and my makeup/ hair care addiction. Again, I WANT to work. It would only be 16 hrs. a week, so that isn’t too bad, is it?"

174350314,I didn’t know I had schizophrenia until a pdoc diagnosed me with it. I breathed a sigh of relief because there was medication that would help. My mom originally insisted that I see a psychiatrist.
176033404,Common feeling but we all go through it. Meds come at a cost. I’m just saying that I don’t mind that cost. My pre meds days were never good. Too much loneliness. After meds I’m so better off. Sure. I’m slower. I’m dumber. I never get out of first gear but it’s a small price to pay for some sanity to me… No slight. Just saying what helps me and your right I don’t work for a living so I have some liberties with time you don’t .
176033405,Yes but if you check high depressive episodes its worst over .7

176033407,It’s possible…
176033408,"Sounds like you’re depressed. A healthy mind would want the tests, and would want to fight. Try counting your reasons to live, maybe use some tools to cope. I for one think you’re worth getting the tests, and IF need be, getting treatment. You’re worth trying to save."

176033411,I have autism. I’ve probably read about 20 books about it since my diagnosis. And I’ve been talking about it with a psychologist for the past few years. There are some people on the forum I suspect have it as well. But I’m also starting to think that schizophrenia and autism are closely related too.

176033413,That the picture I chose could be construed as representating an arquetypal monster (which I seriously doubt) doesn’t entail the conclusion that my creature is not alone. It’s simply the best I could do.
176033414,So much abuse… But I still love them it’s a really weird dynamic
176033415,Anyone ever have voices that you thought as alien and all you had to do is convince them you don’t have the resources to help them for them to go away? If so has it helped?
174350309,"I see a naturopath. What she does is get labs, read the results, and then prescribe a lot of supplements for me to take. The focus was on treating my low energy/depression and I also have thyroid problems. I found it a pain and expensive to buy all the supplements and remember to take them at the indicated time. So I started getting only the ones that we could see results in my lab. My naturopath can prescribed since I’m in _NAME_. There’s like 8 states or so where naturopaths can prescribe. I also have a new NP that suggested I try L-theanine and NAC to treat schizophrenia. So I got some and gave it a try but will probably not stick to it as I don’t really see a huge difference."
176033416,Same here. Latuda makes me moderately lethargic during the day and really sleepy after dinner. I usually go to bed at 8 pm.
174350318,"Interesting, I think if a person is predisposed to gambling and impulsivity and maybe it makes worse? Even though I’m on Invega, sometimes I purchase a game or a dlc for a game that I probably will never play or play after a year or two. I was really impulsive when I was psychotic - I bought perfume worth 130£ and then loads of cigarettes for 57£, lost all my wage in a week. That what scares me the most about abilify. I would rather suffer kinda high prolactin that bang out my and my family’s money for meaningless stuff."
176033417,ok. I have to be careful not to “diagnose” you here. But didn’t your doctor even say you were Psychotic or no? What was your diagnosis?
176033418,"It all depends on what your looking for. To generalize; If you’re looking for energy and motivation, try dopamine supplements. If you’re looking for relaxation, try GABA supplements. Dont mess with serotonin supplements. If you’re looking for cognition and concentration, try choline supplements. There’s a shizload of others which touch upon other things. Do some research and ask your pdoc."
174350313,"I don’t totally dismiss that possibility. For me crystallised intelligence is much better than fluid intelligence. Executive functioning isn’t very good - NB organising and planning,sequential tasks . Both _PERSON_’s and schizophrenia , which I have , can negatively affect EF."
176033419,"Sometimes I think that we here on the forum are people with unique minds. So distant, but so close."
176033420,It’s the way you sometimes phrase things. Sounds as if you’re arguing. Why not turn the tv off to try to fight it?
176033421,"That’s kinda funny, I never had that since I was only a freshman, but now it’s an industry a whole degree as an event planner."
176033422,"Yeah, going for a walk outside is way better than staying indoors all the time. Watch out you don’t slip and fall on the ice. You don’t want to be injuring yourself."
174350315,my psych wont allow me to quit my meds because she is scared i would just become psychotic again…
176033423,I need a degree to do that- not finished with my sociology degree.

176033424,"_PERSON_ only some get married and work but I have seen dating websites for mentally disabled and Down syndrome so its possible I guess if its not severe. I talked to a mentally disabled girl in university who was working at the cafeteria, she seemed normal to me, the boss there told me not to talk to her. I felt bad for her. I am sure it depends on mental disability level."
176033425,Yeah 10 mg Used to work now i need more.
176033426,"_PERSON_… I clearly was feeling that I sit on my couch and even want to hide from fear in the wardrobe because of my fears precisely… I ignore if they are a paranoia still… my conversion disorder was based on my fears too but maybe something else too… I find, that you can die from paranoia and not be able to move precisely because of it… having a hiding behaviour from it… anyway… I had my years where I was calmer and I’ve only slept though… One sick friend even told me, that she doesn’t want to be “calm” as me… I fight this state too still… it’s good that you are on the forum though, it helps me too"
176033427,Sooo creative! I love reading these thoughtful responses! I see a sea turtle juggling!
174350329,I really wish I could do abilify. It made me feel extremely anxious when I took it.
176033428,"It isn’t run by nurses. Yes, this site supports the use of medication. There is no need to put up a wall."
174350327,"So theres this guy that lives in my village and Ive just heard he got into trouble somehow at the pub last Friday. This guy used to be my friend back in the day and about 3 years ago he moved away from my village and was in a heavy car accident which resulted in brain damage. When he came back he was definatly abit slow from the impact on his brain. However my mom told me that she read on Facebook that he caused serious trouble ( fighting ) I presume at the local pub up the road. His dad made this huge statement saying hes Schizophrenic. The other people are all talking about how dangerous schizophrenia is and that he is a danger to everyone. I didnt know he was SZ and I dont believe he is. I spoke to him when he was back and he unfortunatly could hardly even remember me, since when do SZ people forget so much ? It just pisses me off cause I think the father used that as a bullshiit story to get him off the hook. Anyways, rant over"
174350320,Regulates my mood and depression better too. I think it’s because I got depressed from the negatives so much. I feel much better. Not sure if it’s controlling my psychosis anymore. I started out on 3 mg and now I’m on 9 mg. The problem is the doctors think I’m schizophrenic and nothing helps. He even suggested a new medication totally and even trying ECT because I’m depressed and lack motivation. I’m more interested in rtms anyways.
176033429,"I went to a group before that was in the nearby city, and they paid people a travel allowance to make sure that geography/cost doesn’t prevent you from accessing the service.

176033430,Must be a nice day for injections!
176033431,"Its weird, when blitzkrieg is in the air, suddenly everyone lines up for _PERSON_. Seems little _NAME_ is pregnant today and his pet snail is sympathetic! Must have been the “grapes of wrath” inspiration, step by step, book buy book, chapter and verse, without a knowledge of the actual language. Especially the programming ones. It all goes back to the BBC. BBS’s probably. I guess I have to ask the original question again, that got my moderator status revoked on this site: Please define the word PSYCHOSIS its current definition and the etymology behind the term. Then do the same with your perscribed poisons. Why the divided mind, there should be no question about the concept of love and community? Why?"
176033432,"Thats another problem, if you dont like your job change it simple, people say i dont make enough change your job. thats your answer. Start bussiness. come man dont give me that."
176033433,"yeah I’m struggling tonight. I’m just afraid. Not afraid of anything specific, just afraid."
176033434,"I have sza diagnosis, but what i really have is schizotypal pers disorder."

176033437,"You are having a delusion, om. Don’t let it ruin you."
176033438,"I was first paranoid at the age of 6. It continued throughout my childhood. I became prodromal bulimic at the age of 15 and I had no friends. At 23, in college, I had my first psychotic breakdown but I hid it. I remained psychotic throughout my 20’s. At 31, I became suicidal and was hospitalized. At age 34, I developed olfactory hallucinations and was diagnosed sza. In my early 40’s, I developed auditory hallucinations and my suicidal depression disappeared. In my mid 50’s, my psychosis went away with meds."
176033439,"I’m worried today because my voices are trying to instruct me to murder someone and hurt myself. I don’t have a mean bone in my body so I won’t obviously. But do you think this is something to worry about or should I tell someone? I was recently discharged from my local eip team, so I don’t have my CPN anymore"

176033441,I live in the US in Kansas
176033442,"Things didn’t get better for me until I found my right med. I went on disability in January 2015 because I just couldn’t handle working anymore and I was calling out at least once a week. I was on Haldol then, which was raised all the way up to 30 mg during the past three years. Two months ago, I was dangerously close to going inpatient, so my pdoc recommended switching to something else. I started Zyprexa and almost immediately started feeling better. I’m now going into week 8 and the change is nothing short of miraculous. Even my wicked paranoia is gone. I’m currently job hunting to find something that’s got a good routine to it. I’m looking forward to getting off disability and making more money. I’m not saying Zyprexa is the answer for everyone, just that it’s possible to find the right med for you to get better."
176033443,My grandmother lived to 93. If she hadn’t have gotten the flu she probably would have lived longer. She had bad hips. Once when she was getting into the car to leave the nursing home and come visit with us as she was struggling she said don’t get old _NAME_. I think mid 70s will be good for me. A little bit of retirement and can hopefully still live on my own.
176033444,Never tried it. Sounds good though.
176033445,I step walk… what’s a Burpee _AT_MENTION_? Never mind thanks.
176033446,"Many of my preSZ friends are doctors, brain surgeon, cardiologist, pharmacists, pediatrician, ophtalmologist, dentist, etc Staying in bed all day compared to them pisses me off."
176033447,"Yes, for the backing. Sorry, should have been more specific."
174350325,"I have been making choices… Bad ones, and now I feel ever worse. “It’s just me and nibbling conscious”. I can’t even look at my parents, I feel… Never mind there is no point in expressing that right now. I feel like death is knocking on my door, frankly I wouldn’t mind, (I’m not suicidal) but I’m feeling numb. I feel like someone is nibbling on my heart causing so much pain and I can’t do nothing about it, as if I have a ton on my chest I stay in bed every day I always rest. Sometimes sometimes sometimes, I feel like I’m better off dead. I’m no good son, I’m a failure in every sense of the word, no one understands they minimize my feelings and tell me everyone has schizophrenia and or this is not as bad as other people. I just sit there suffering with great anxiety my stomach feels like it’s on fire, my eyes bulge out from the sensory overload. Wish I had my grandmother… She died… Anyway no time to be weak."

176033453,"I accepted it right away. It was nice to have answers. Lately I’ve been in denial again, or i just forget. Really easy to forget it’s an actual serious illness. This site helps remind me and other people, when i act oddly. I’m still half convinced it was a misdiagnosis. I just feel guilty for being so unmotivated and confused in my thinking."

176033456,What is ‘thought broadcasting?’.
176033457,A lot of people seem to think they have some kind of inalienable right to crank the volume on their cd players to ungodly volumes. I think it is inconsiderate as hell. They ought to issue fines for playing music too loud. They can get ear phones at very reasonable prices. Maybe you could buy her some ear phones. Maybe then she will take the hint.

My stepdaughter knows him more. It seems he does a lot of charity work."
176033464,"You know its strange for me, because i stopped weed for a couple of months as i was done with it then i got schizophrenia. In my first episode experience i didnt even wanted to go toilet because i was paranoid about someone watching me, i wasnt constipated but it started to build up so one day it was just enough is enough, so i put my shame aside and use the toilet. You know when you stool, its weird when you think someone is watching or even know if they watching."
176033465,"hmmm…worst thing I’ve done…probably not fighting hard enough to marry the girl I got pregnant instead of just letting her have the abortion…yes I paid for the abortion for her. regret it though, I would’ve liked to have a son or daughter."

176033486,It depends on you. It’s important to keep taking the pills and be honest with your shrink. You tend to get some results within 4-6 weeks. It isn’t a fast process so you need to hang in there. It’s one of those things. The meds helped me slowly get over the delusions as your mind heals a bit…well I think it’s more of new neural pathways from the meds but it does happen… How long you been on the pills? It’s a strange process. You get receptor occupancy within the first 24 hours but benefits can take time…

174350340,"Hello everyone. I just finished talking to a friend (who isn’t schizophrenic and is a computer guy) about my memory issues. I have a hard time processing information as it is told to me and I also have a hard time remembering things very well. I was listening to a higher management figure today give me instructions on things to do and I heard what he first said but as he continued talking I only remembered and retained the last 80 percent of it. I lucked out that the first thing he told me was thereafter done by him and off of my plate but it was still frustrating to have happen. This isn’t my first experience like this but after talking with my friend we likened it to RAM in a computer which can only process so much before it can’t process anymore. So I sort of have what you could call an ‘overflow error’ where I can’t fully keep something in my memory if it is too big. I have had to make myself lists, which he likened to ‘writing to disk’ ha, and lists work much better than trying 
to remember what I have to do. Even now I am having a hard time recalling what all my friend and I talked about, it is really frustrating. The gist of it though is my working memory isn’t very good. Does anyone else have these issues and if so what exactly does it feel like for you and what do you do to deal with it?"
176033490,"What drives me crazy is seeing my teen act exactly like I did. Well, better because I did things she doesn’t know ab out!"

176033495,"I was 48 years old and I had just moved into a like-new studio apartment by myself. Me and my family assumed that was where I would live for the rest of my life. But I stayed there 6 years and went through a bunch of crap with neighbors almost the whole time. And moved out after 6 years. There was always a subtle feeling of reverse racism because there were a certain group who were the majority. But some people in the complex liked me. The lady two doors down couldn’t speak English but we were always friendly and we exchanged cards and gifts each Christmas and during the year we talked a little and she liked to leave little bags of food by my door which was always a nice surprise. But I was unhappy there a lot but I still did fun things and got out and I had a car and I drove all over the place, had a couple of friends. Anyways, I was working at _PERSON_’s most of that time and some people there liked me even though I didn’t talk much. I impressed some people there. I used to walk around the 
area at night by myself like at 2:00 am or 3:00 am and go to the Walgreens behind the complex or just randomly walk around. Or drive all over all night. I loved living with my cat and having a space to call my own and I didn’t have to answer to anyone."

176033505,Turn that into a puzzle! I would put that together for sure. It’s sweet.
176033506,I take 100mg of seroquel a night for sleep. It works well for me. Without it I don’t sleep even with two other meds that are supposed to knock you out. I’m glad you went to the hospital as drinking and sleeping pills does not sound like a good mix. I hope you get some stability soon as I don’t think you are really thinking clearly right now and need to stay close to your treatment team.
176033507,Is it possible to feel weird and mentally fragile just by missing a dose?
176033508,"I’m having a real strong urge to cut. I don’t think I’ve been this close in years. A few days ago. I grabbed a knife I had next to me from eating, and I ran it across my skin without thinking. It didn’t leave a mark, but it worries me that I just did that. I don’t know what prompted it, but now I can’t get the urge to go away The friend I usually call to talk to about those things doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, and none of my online friends are online due to timezone differences. I feel so alone in this, It’s never lasted this long without me also having psychosis or getting into a hospital or something, it’s so weird. There’s no explanation for it. I don’t know how to deal or how long distraction works. Would anyone mind sharing their techniques to not just distract themselves, but also lessening the urges? Maybe try to talk some sense into me?"
176033509,"Welcome to the forum! I’m sorry to hear of your troubles. Sometimes relatives have little experience in dealing with a mental illness. Do not worry, you are not less human for having one. I hope you find support here. When I first joined, I had a lot of suicidal thoughts. I didn’t explicitly state it or mention it then, but I found this place to be full of great people who I can relate to. Since then, I have reduced in suicidal thoughts by a lot. Please feel free to post on any thread you find interest in. I’m sorry you feel there is no one who cares about you. I’m sure there are people who do care. Again, welcome to the forum.

176033523,"My delusions before I was medicated were just continuously evolving as I let them lead me down certain paths. It was crazy. They literally controlled me and I let them do it. I ended up taking the Euro tunnel to Paris from London on the tunnel because I was hallucinating these extremists who were out to get to me. They used magic and the authorities could not detect them Messed up big time. I used to be really clever at school until I got mixed up in drug gangs. My intelligence is still there, but its existence is very complicated to explain. I don’t know how I get by like I do, but I have retained enough of my brain so far to be pretty functional Now I just ignore these things using the same reasoning that I use to dispel religious ideology"
176033524,Thank you for your reply. He did try few therapists at the beginning but all of them ask him to take medicine so he refused to go therapist either. He think they are not helping either. I really don’t know how often he experience hallucinations because he never open up to me. He get really mad when I asked him to see doctor every time. He is too afraid to face this disease and the side effect of mad scare him away. He is trying to finish his senior year but I don’t think he can make it. I am just waiting for him to break down. I really think force hospitalization will be necessary in his case. It just too painful to see him suffer.

The problem is I don’t like all these doctors trying to make ‘their mark’ on me. My original pdoc I knew since I was 16, and he treated me on and off for 17 years! If I had anxiety disorder, depression and autism, he would have sussed it out I accept the ASD, as it fits really well. Not trying to be funny about it, I just don’t like the fact I have four mental health problems when in reality I only have 2 at best"

176033529,I think it’s the animation style and voice they used on that one that made it the scariest. I was a big fan of that asian dude who kept inventing stuff and terrorizing courage with it.

176033533,you are not a bad person for sure though… don’t believe otherwise… you deserve a good life. But it’s hard living a life with this sickness huh… it took a long time for me to accept that i had to be happy with a simpler life where less happens but i did find some happiness in it. I hope you manage to find that too. But it’s hard when you got like really authoritarian person in your life and they have a whole different image of life and it’s hard then to form your own image of life.

Cotton sweaters, colorful socks, brightly colored overcoats, Totoro tummy warmers, computer care kit, biology arts and crafts, protecting important historical settings, shojo anime, you name it it’s in China now.

176033538,From what I understand you can’t have more than one disorder on the SZ spectrum.
176033539,I think so too - people with mental illness aren’t weak minded - we are some of the bravest warriors out there! We just have a chemical imbalance which leads to symptoms. We have illness of mind but not weak minds.
176033540,Telling the psychotic person to go to the hospital is the right thing to do.

176033553,"_AT_MENTION_ If you’re on Zoloft already I highly suggest considering naltrexone. Naltrexone cuts drinking cravings on its own, but in combination with Zoloft it cuts the risk of relapse way down. I used to drink 6 times a week and at my worst was in and out rehabs for alcoholism and mental illness. Couldn’t stay sober. When I started naltrexone it cut down my drinking greatly. But then I started Zoloft I quit completely. I’ve never drank more than a few sips of naltrexone/Zoloft. It’s like impossible. If you have any questions just @ me."

176033577,The problem with that research is that roughly speaking 33% of schizophrenics recover without meds 33% of schizophrenics need meds and do “ok” on them 33% of schizophrenics are treatment resistant The people off meds who were doing better could have been a self selecting group. I.e. the 33% who would have recovered anyway. It was a study of just 139 people. I wouldn’t go off meds because of that one piece of research. I’m not an expert but it seems a bit flawed to me.

And in my case they did say “you are under arrest” and put cuffs on me. So you are definitely ok.

174350367,"What I was told is I will end up being tortured after death, but they didn’t mention hell. Furthermore, when I heard someone speak something religious the concept of hell came to my mind, and I was told I will not end up in “any general hell”, but “their personal hell”. I was shown an image where supposedly thousands or millions of beings are in a constant state of sleep, where they are being tortured. They are supposedly being maintained by some psychopathic extraterrestrial civilization. Later came a theory that I may end up being just a consciousness existing without body in an everlasting state of torture. I cannot be concerned about it because I have no thoughts or emotions, but the inserted thoughts/concepts and voices were constantly occupying my mind, talking about that torture, or about why I would end up there (or why I got my “schizophrenia”). The inserted thoughts are still reminding it to me every day, although it’s not as intense as it used to be. Now for some reason t
he voices say it’s a lie that I’m going to be tortured after death, but they’ve also said the inserted thoughts are now telling the truth. Sometimes the voices tell the opposite. They claimed I should know which is the truth, because I’m “supposed to be a god”. They also told it doesn’t matter if I really am a god now or not - after death they’ll make me believe that I’m a god, and then it will be “my own fault” I’m being tortured (they have even told me that I will then believe that I’m torturing myself, and they’ve showed me a strange feeling of inevitability that there’s no way out of the torture)."

176033630,I used to love Easter cos every year my grandmother would buy my sister and I a new dress
176033631,Honestly the reason why I became psychotic 5 years ago was because I came off of risperdal too quickly and was placed on Vraylar which probably made me manic. These meds are very difficult to come off of safely. Antipsychotic withdrawal can cause psychosis in itself. Rapid discontinuation of an antipsychotic is not recommended when switching meds. It should be done over a span of a couple of months if not more.

176033674,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ that you want to think about the burnout rate. Another thing to consider is how much a social worker makes in your area. Will it be enough to make up for the cost of a masters degree? It’s a good and necessary field. But check on benefits and average pay in your area before committing to a degree. I don’t know what part time benefits are like nowadays. I live in a state that kept Medicaid expansion and is currently lobbying for universal statewide coverage, so the situation in my state is different than yours, probably."

176033678,"I have them written down. Some are pretty basic, some are more specific to the things I’m insecure about. A lot of it involves gender confirmation like “You don’t have a male/female body, you have a you body,” and “Your gender is not dependent on how well you pass to other people.”"

176033691,Man of mystery!
174350387,I do have positive symptoms yes. Two spirits in my head that talk to me and each other (_PERSON_ and _NAME_) and I have paranoia about my mother in law poisoning me and people reading my mind via eye contact etc. And negative symptoms like chronic avolition and empty dead feelings. And labile mood swings and depressions. Sometimes I just get the voices without moods and sometimes together.
176033692,I get mixed states too - where I want to laugh and cry and punch or throw something all at same time. And prone to self harm.

174350392,I think it can hard to define a functioning level if you have other diagnoses/or suspected diagnoses additionally to schizophrenia. For example should schizophrenia .85 and Asperger’s .8(1=functioning like normal) be seen as .85 or .85x.8= 0.68 ? Or if you had schizophrenia 0.9 Asperger’s 0.85 and dyspraxia 0.8 should functioning be seen as 0.9 or 0.9 x0.85 x0.8 = 0.612 ?

176033709,My voices scream insults at me after every thought I have.
176033710,How many mg of abilify were you on? Im on 10mg but it didn’t do anything for my negative symptoms
176033711,"Prices reflect the error in a form like ourselves or some other creation. Paying money is an imitation of correcting the form. We pay with a number, imitating the calculation of correction. Wantonness can be an error in itself and can lead to debt. Haggling can sometimes be part of the imitation of the error correction process and other times be an affront to the correct correction. Yet why does form imitate error correction at all? Why does it not simply get corrected instantly? The answer is because form is never complete. All systems have errors. Form poses a question? What is wrong with me? How can I improve? How can I change for the better? Form changes endlessly, and in reality has no substance, being pure creation of the mind. It imitates the mind reflecting it so the mind can see its dreams. It is the mind that corrects, in its total wisdom, manifesting itself within itself, with the form imitating by judging what is good or bad, the price of form as profit or debt. It is far better to not 
judge at all. Thank you."

No sunlight in unless we purposely pull them open. We had lived near a lot of sex offenders in SD back years ago cause the state has no laws on where they can’t live, so there were 34 convicted and registered offenders in a town of maybe 400 in.town. 700 counting outer parts ranches. The school was 4 blocks from us, so no chances, we put silver aluminum bubble wrap type material on windows and blackout curtains there too. That was done before we moved in with my grandparents back in 1997 when they moved there and I was 12ish/13 and my sisters were 9 and 5 we visited whole summers."

Of course I had delusions like that I had a sister, did a lot of nutty things while being on a college campus, and on 2 security guard jobs, and was hallucinating 24/7. But I’m sure the real kicker was the cost of the meds, and the fact my parents’ insurance had dropped me. The doctors had to be payed. I also think my parents used a lawyer. How easy was it? One day I went to the hospital to sign some papers which the lady didn’t allow me to try to read (it’s hard to read anything when you are fully psychotic but I suspect they were hiding something.), and without having any further input into the process my parents drove me to the Social Security office where they showed me the bs rules of SSI. I would suggest to you that you need to be a desperate sole, or lost in space like i was to submit to that crap. Anyway it was kinda like signing my life away at the time because back then you couldn’t even work and the medical assistance that was p
aid for got more expensive over time which made me not want to use the Ticket to Work to effectively lose my health insurance. What I’m saying is if you are down to your last meal due to medical costs apply for it Otherwise keep the government out of your business as much as you can and stay as free as you can unless you absolutely can’t function like I couldn’t."

174350405,"About every time there is a mass shooting in the US (with the exception of the inner city shootings which don’t reach the national news level usually) the conclusion is quickly reached that the shooter was hearing voices or at least mentally ill whether the shooter is dead or alive or an actual psychologist concludes it. People used to say “he was a quiet man”. But now a person “who knew him” can diagnose schizophrenia in the public’s mind. But there’s a more important reason we feel prejudice from normies. It’s the general reality of the disease. With most illnesses the person is bad off for a while and then gets better and rejoins society. For many of us we don’t get better enough to rejoin society even with the meds. We also are often saddled with further problems by the meds’ side effects, and the fact our behaviors can include the use of tobacco in order to cope where the drugs run short. So we are often abandoned by most of society and eventually can even be abandoned by o
ur families."

If you take them for a month, six months or a year and then stop, the chances are extremely high that you will gain all the weight back—and more. The best way to lose weight in a healthy way and keep it off is eat plenty of vegetables and fruit, cut sugar out of your diet, eat low fat or fat free dairy and lean cuts of meat for protein and healthy grains. Some nuts and oil are alright. Those are the base for a healthy weight loss. And of great importance is portion control. At first, restaurants were the ones who some years ago started giving out too large of portions. It kind of turned into people serving large portions at home."

The product is these little sticks that you put in your kitchen drain to clean it, dissolve clogs and de-odorize it. I can spot a lot of scams but it seemed legit. For about $35.00 they claim to give you a four months supply. I went to pay the money and discovered they had tacked on an extra $45.00 for a set of two TV antennas that supposedly get you a lot of channels without paying for cable. Actually, I don’t fall for scams easily but a few months ago a different company was offering similar antennas for a low price so I bought one and when it arrived I hooked it up to find it did almost nothing. Well, the “stix” company had tacked on the antennas, I didn’t order them myself. So I inadvertently paid for them and I didn’t ask for them. I didn’t know I had been ripped off until I paid the money and left the website. Then I started researching these “stix” things. My heart sunk. P
eople were saying in reviews those little stix were useless, that they actually clogged drains instead of clearing them, that they blocked drains, and they flat out did not work. Also people who also got scammed said the company does not give refunds and that the company is run with committing other questionable business practices.

The question; Why they were said that ? Because of the uncertainly of a genetic disease, genetic mutation or any change in a gene that is ultimately responsible for creating sz or its symptoms . This basis on the fact that,the current medications that can be used to correct / modify the brain chemistry (according to the medication’s strategic map of genetic disease ) they do not succeed in the modifying or correcting as expected ! All treatment results achieving a reduction of the severity of the symptoms-nothing more Th
e question Why there is no discovery for a mutational gene ? We explain the reason, by saying that the mutation was represented only in parasitic pathogen that was linked with the psychological user component and has seeks to becomes a part of its nature by force Therefore,the main change ,must be arise in the psychological user at first and then it is reflected in the chemical background in second,unlike what happens in all mental illness that arise from anatomical ,neurological,chemical or genetic factors in general This simple explanation is for the next generation not for the current,because his poor knowledge about the sz nature / cause made his maximum ambition goal in the life is the diagnosis of the symptoms in the body,blood ,urine or tissue sample AND reduce the severity of the symptoms !"

I was at the gym and was called by my name and they _USER_ID_ talked me and encouraged me and it was so nice. There was a really gorgeous guy there and he remembered my name . My gym partner was lovely too and she was not heaps fitter than me. Last time I had s gym partner she was much much fitter than me and I could not keep up and I was the only slow one in the group but today she and I were more equal in fitness I think which was very helpful and I did not think I could stay at the gym and do all the exercises but I could with their _USER_ID_ talk etc easily do it. I might feel like a part of the community in a way. I was always a outsider.specially in Sweden they hated on me for being different and not working but here in Australia they seem to accept me as I am more and encourage me and praise me for the lit
tle good I do do and that brings out the best in me I think and able me to do more . I value the life I am living right now. In the future I might be able to visit a old or sick person once a week and drink coffee with them and give them a pedicare but it depends on the person.i don’t go well with all people and can’t stand to be around some even if I like them I value being me and I value my life right now as it is and I value my sacred neigh being retired and I value being a vegan and hope to be one for the rest of my life.

176033908,"GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News – 23 Jul 19 Exosomes May Hold Key to Brain Circuit Development New discovery suggests cellular 'cargo' transporters play a profound role in creating brain cells and circuits Now, investigators at the Scripps Research Institute have published new data showing that exosomes are not only integral to the development of neurons and neural circuits, but they can restore health to brain cells affected by developmental disease. Findings from the new study were published recently in PNAS through an article titled, “Exosomes regulate neurogenesis and circuit assembly"" https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/17/_PHONE_NO_ Amazingly, the researchers also tested whether adding healthy exosomes to a culture-dish model of _PERSON_ syndrome would provide a therapeutic effect. It did. “That was perhaps our most exciting finding: that exosomes from healthy cells can indeed rescue neurodevelopmental deficiencies in cells with Rett syndrome,” Cline remarked. 
“We see this as very promising because of the many neurodevelopmental disorders in need of a treatment. These are disorders for which we already have a deep understanding of the underlying gene deficiencies but are still lacking a therapy to address the disease itself.”"

With schizophrenia and other disorders it becomes problematic if your experiencing positive and negative symptoms or a combination of. So some of the things you’ve outlined could be, in the right circumstances, within those boundaries. We aren’t doctors here and that is why it’s important to stay with your doctor/s and take the pills that are prescribed. Other things on your list seem just part of living and plausible.

Like he said it probably was a “bone head move.” but he didn’t mean anything by it and I think he’s taking a little bit too much grief for an offhand remark. He said something and probably made them both uncomfortable.

My minds been scrambled and memory is really screwing with me, on the side of light delusions. Been irritable and more likely to blow up recently and it got really bad, I threw a frying pan in anger at a wooden floor and it completely ruined it. I feel like even throwing it at concrete wouldnt dent it like that if it wasnt manic rage. So I got a refferal today. The doctor agreed there was a good chance given my family history that I really need to see a psychiatrist. Scares me though. Lot of change in my life if I do get diagnosed.

176034051,The half life of caffeine is like 12 hours. Caffeine constricts blood vessels this triggers your bodies negative feedback system to bring it back to equilibrium. The heart is a muscle. When it doesn’t get enough blood it tenses up and the muscle gets stronger. Eventually the heart muscle gets so big from flexing that you out grow the blood supply this leads to cardiomyopathy. Then your life expectancy gets shortened.

176034053,"Well my delusions have been gone since June 2nd or 3rd. Not an inch, an ounce, a gram, of spec of me wants to believe them anymore. They were really strong previously. I cant suggest doing what I did ever to squash the delusions. (Feed into them until theyre so strong you have insight into them). But in a way you get the treatment you need not what you want. Im not sure, but I always felt doctors would just ‘go with’ what im saying because I was not one to wanna argue with. And I had very strong defense mechanisms. Think shutter island. But the first 1000 times I didn’t wanna listen. I could do whatever the heck I want with my life now. Except be Jesus or anything along those lines lol. But I really feel I did it this time. Like I said Ive had moments of clarity before but nothing like this. Im sorry for anyone I hurt when I was posting last week but I think I finally have done with the delusions. Im entering IOP for some issues of mine. Everything is gonna be ok though. Im not sure, but Jesu
s makes no sense. Some guy on another website really put me in my place. He was nice about it but I cant even explain. He was very wise I guess and he said exactly what I needed to hear. I could’ve heard it before but I wasn’t ready but now I was definitely ready."

174350470,"AUT00206 is also a non-dopaminergic medication - at least not directly, but it may indirectly help normalize dopamine function. It’s just completed phase 1b so they don’t completely understand its pharmacodynamics yet. It is a potassium channel modulator. Specifically, parvalbumin+ cells are now also being explored as a novel approach to repairing DLPFC neural circuitry and improving the cognitive symptom domain in schizophrenia ( Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT_PHONE_NO_ ). Parvalbumin+ cells innervate multiple pyramidal cells and contain lower mRNA for parvalbumin and GAD67 in those with schizophrenia ( 124 ) and reduced expression of the potassium channel KCNS3 gene which encodes the Kv9.3 potassium channel ? subunit and is essential for control over its fast-spiking abilities ( 197 ). Inhibitory parvalbumin+ interneurons contribute to the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia ( 115 ) and in unmedicated patients with the illness. I’m not getting too excited about this one yet since it is 
early phase but it is very intriguing and novel. Autifony and BI propose it for cognitive and negative symptoms."
176034055,I have literally tried everything to treat my severe anxiety. I am focusing on pregablin for now. I took 150mg daily but it stopped working after a couple of months. I note that the anxiety stops after starting a new drug but then my body develops a tolerance to it and back comes the anxiety/panic attacks. This happens with anti depressants too. I am just trying to gauge the thinking for everyone about whether taking it PRN would work so your body does not become tolerant to it or for that matter whether taking an antipsychotic PRN may have a similar effect? Thanks in advance.

176034063,Maybe but I still had negative and cognitive symptoms when I stopped meds for 1-2 years.

176034064,"My brain is forcing me to burn down the clinic. They have treated me badly and I need to get my revenge. They no longer choose to help me and leave me to rot. They need to pay for what they have done to me. I have been obsessing over this for a few days. My head thinks that if I don’t have the stones to kill myself, I have to be a threat to them to prove that I need their help. It’s a sad thing that they do not help you here unless you lose it. I don’t want to lose it or do anything stupid, but I can feel my grip on my control system is beginning to slip and I am getting all these horrible thoughts of what I need to do. I don’t want to do something stupid, but if things don’t get sorted out I am going to be provoked into a reaction that is not favourable for everyone involved."

176034103,I’m sorry you are finding it hard to cook _AT_MENTION_ . I don’t cook all of the time. Tonight I am reheating pork roast and bean and vegetable soup from the freezer. I make large amounts of food and freeze some of it for easy dinners.
174350477,I take 200mg in the morning and 300mg at night.
176034104,"_AT_MENTION_ I hope so! Sometimes it’s just a strange pattern, I can be stuck for several days and then I’ll lose two or three pounds quickly. I just have to keep going like I have been and be patient. _AT_MENTION_ I hope you start losing soon! I too am happy I didn’t gain, but I want to start moving down again. I have this fear that I’ll gain back all the weight I’ve lost. I’m being far too careful with my food intake for that, but I used to have bulimia between ages 13 and 23 (I’m 48 now) and I have residual anxiety around my weight. It’s sometimes a fine line between just being careful and wanting to resort to past self destructive behavior. I haven’t relapsed with my bulimia since a single episode in 2011, but the urges are still there sometimes."

176034137,I am pretty well physically. I go to the gym four times a week. I have a normal bmi I think (160cm weigh approximately 60kg)but still would like to lose 5-8 kg. I’m a vegan.

I had ovarian cancer about seven years ago so I had early menopause. I had my ovaries removed and now I want to have my uterus removed as I think it will just give me problems (had abnormal bleeding etc) I have a thing on my kidney and need to have a scan of that in a few months. thankfully I’m well otherwise I think. How is your physical health?
176034138,"For antipsychotics there is no replacement, but if you ever decide to quit ap’s at some point because for instance you have been stable for a long time there are a lot of supplements that can help get the mind back on track. For example calming herbs like valerian root might contribute to keep the mind stable after quitting ap’s. For anti-depressive effects it is a whole different story. There are probably hundreds of supplements that can boost mood and work as a anti-depressant. Some have been shown to equal effect of anti-depressant or even outperform anti-depressants. There are a lot of interesting studies on pubmed and other places. And ofcourse the real benefit is that there are very little side-effects if any from natural anti-depressants. Some supplements that work personally for me are: raw cocoa powder, vitamin D and rhodiola rosea."

174350494,I posted this 2 weeks ago. It had been getting subtly worse since then. Inch by inch worse. I took a big dose of L-theanine today like I said in another thread and now it’s all ok. Like from major distress to tumbleweeds. A few months ago I cut down my L-theanine to 400mg/day. Today I took 800mg. I’m beginning to wonder if it’s the combination of abilify and high dose l-theanine that’s kept me out of hospital so far and not abilify alone. But I had certainly lost insight.

Sure, some good or bad event may happen but the percentage or odds that either that good or bad event will occur is based on certain requirements or environmental data to make a certain pertcentage an actual number. Even though my avatar is the yin & yang (??), this philosophical concept still applies to me to this day. For example, the left hand and the right hand where 90% of people around the world will write with a pen with their right hand as opposed to their left hand. Or the light versus the dark which can go both ways or equilaterally depending on the solstices and equinoxes of the planet. Etc."

176034167,"I have an anecdote for you, _AT_MENTION_ . I’ve obviously been in the psych realm for many years. I’ve seen lots of varying cases of TD, from mild to incapacitated and can barely breathe. My wife and I went to a nursing home to visit her sister. While I was standing in the lobby, I asked my wife if she could spot the people with TD (almost all off them had pill-rolling or orofacial grimacing and lip smacking). She couldn’t until I pointed them out to her. The point I’m trying to make is unless you have a trained eye, the average person won’t notice minor TD or will have just zero concept of what it is. It’s the folks in the field who can sniff it out. Next time you see your psychiatrist, ask them to do an AIMS test on you (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale). Any pdoc worth his salt should be able to do it, and if not, I’d find a new doc, frankly. You’ll get scored but you won’t be told the score. Based off the findings, the doc may adjust your meds or give you others to help com
bat any issues that arise. The test is totally painless and easy. You just sit in a chair in an upright position and follow the doc’s directions. Takes about 2 minutes. Forewarned is forearmed. Hope this helps."

174350504,It’s not immoral. I was comfortable on disability and I chose to go back to work for me. I may not make it but I have to try. The doctors told me I couldn’t do it but I am doing it and now when I go see my therapist he doesn’t even want to talk about my symptoms. He just asks me how work is going.

174350506,Not all people become ill. Not all people who take drugs become sz etc. It is a strawman argument to have a hard and fast rule and apply it to each and everyone and to say all people who watch media become violent and vice versa. I was inferring that media influence lives and it does. To what extent depends on the individual. How vulnerable that person is will alter their reaction to it. Why you are a violent person off meds I cannot answer. Were you a violent child? Did you get your own way as a child by violence? I could just as easily ask why aren’t all violent children schizophrenic? Absurd isn’t it?

They told him they knew they couldn’t remove it all, but that they’d fly in an expert to make sure they got as much as they could. Well, guess what!

Maybe it’s a little bit like the troubles some folk here Have in getting a shower: really hard to explain/describe but strongly felt all the same. I will watch the rest of the movie later. Is ‘behind enemy lines’ en.m.wikipedia.org Behind Enemy Lines (2001 film) Behind Enemy Lines is a 2001 American war film directed by _NAME_ in his directorial debut, and starring _NAME_ and Gene _PERSON_. The film tells the story of Lieutenant _NAME_, an American naval flight officer who is shot down over Bosnia and uncovers genocide during the Bosnian War. Meanwhile, his commanding officer is struggling to gain approval to launch a combat search and rescue mission to save _NAME_. The plot is loosely based on the 1995 Mrkonji? Grad incident that occur... I thought Gene _PERSON_ might save the movie if he was as good as in crimson tide but unfortunately the movie sucks"

176034236,"Zyprexa gives me insomnia so I have to take it in the morning. The first night I took it at bedtime, I didn’t sleep all night long. The next two nights, I took it at bedtime and ended up taking Klonopin at 2 a.m. to force myself to sleep. Then I started taking it in the early morning when I got up to use the bathroom and I sleep fine now. I also take 6 mg of Melatonin at bedtime."

176034238,I like it man It doesn’t sound typical hip hop because the drums are under the rest of the beat imo. I like more emphasis on drum. More dark. Idk exactly how to say it since I’m not a producer. But I like the start. But I think you need more darkness and emphasis on the drums. But it is very nice. I can work with it either way. But lmk if you could do that. It sounds too dreamy and I’d like something more aggressive if you can. Not to sacrifice your essence but just make it a lil more in a dark more baratone sound I’d say or so…? Thank you
176034239,Yes they know they are giving me 900 mg of NAC and are nice to me.

You’ll get worried, then paranoid, then desperate. Desperate to let it all go. Only you can’t, because you’re trapped in another world, and you’ve got no idea how you got here, but you did and now you’ve got no choice but to press on until your delusional world finally clashes with what is real, and you’re so out of it that whoever you’re with has no choice but to call the police and have you admitted to the hospital. Or, you could take your meds as prescribed and do your best to drop the matter, unfinished theories and all."

176034245,I’m not poking fun at his delusions. I’m sorry if it seemed that way. Maybe all our delusions are absurd. I guess mine too. It’s probably absurd for me to believe my husband is going to kill me and his mother wants to poison my food or that she can read my mind. It’s probably absurd for me to believe people can read my thoughts through my eye contact with them. Or that the devil is trying to enter me through my private parts. Yes we have funny delusions but it’s ok and part of our illnesses. I’m not suggesting it’s fun. It’s difficult to experience it. I’m sorry if you guys misunderstood me. I guess I’m a stupid insensitive person. Ignore my callous thread if you want to. Lock it if you want to. I don’t want to cause trouble. I’m sorry if I upset you guys. I should know better - I’m delusional too.

176034295,"I’m nuts due to isolation and my delusions. It all has been pretty prevelant during most of my life,. Sometimes I start cursing myself, but I can’t seem to change things."
174350538,"You’ve got a point there. I (or whatever controls me) will try to keep that in mind. The main purposes of this was to 1) compare my case to others’, and see if some more of the differences could be striked out, and 2) see if for someone else their schizophrenia is also messing with them, as if for some purpose). You may be right in this one. According to the voices/fake thoughts my schizophrenia is not actually a “real” schizophrenia, but a condition of the soul, meaning I am indeed possessed. That could explain why that 100mg chlorpromazine/day didn’t do anything to me. I have next appointment for the doctor in December, I will then see if I’ll get some different antipsychotics. Although if it would mean hospitalizing me for observation, then, according to the voices/fake thoughts, it is doubtful it would happen. If the other antipsychotics would work, I wonder what would be their effect then? Since the process that controls the voices also controls my body (at least sometimes), would 
just the strange behavior disappear altogether along with the voices? Or would the “spirit” that “possesses” my body disappear entirely, rendering me to be completely still, unable to do even the basic things (eating, etc) (since 100% of the time I feel my body moves by itself)? Or maybe it would simply silence the voices, which wouldn’t be much, since they don’t affect me as far as I can feel. The main concern would be the unpleasant feelings. And again I get the inserted thoughts saying the medication probably wouldn’t work because the feelings are a conditioning of the soul, not the brain. Now my schizophrenia is messing with me by producing a fake feeling of the “need to pee”. The fake thoughts/voices have said it affects my soul badly if I go to the toilet due to a fake feeling, but since I don’t seem to control my body I can’t help it. I also had yet another dream where I was supposed to escape this schizophrenia, and hints about what would happen if I didn’t. Related to this, I 
noticed one more curious thing: From what I wrote, one can tell there is at least 1 central process controlling at least 3 different symptoms : the voice(s) the (unusual) behavior of my body my dreams The pictures (their content) I am being shown are mostly in perfect sync with the voices or/and inserted thoughts. That could mean that the mind’s eye, or imagination, is also being controlled by this process. Same with many of the new feelings I have felt/seen. For example, the voices (actually the process that controls the voices) used to put a fake focus on different external objects or my body parts (which I can then see or feel respectively), then name each one of them, and then ask the rhetoric question “How could we possibly do that?” apparently (according to the inserted thoughts) to show how capable they, or their “programmer” was. The intelligence that controls when to switch on the torture, aches or/and other unpleasant feelings might be a part of the same process or separate from it. Someon
e mentioned that the reason for all this might be because the brain is a complex thing. If you ask me, that seems quite a bit of complexity (symptoms) to muster up by an error in the brain, for all of it to then gang up and work in tandem against its owner."

It’s hard to have the motivation when you were alone and sick even when I was decently looking… anyone, I need a bit of sugar still sometimes, it probably helps my brain a bit… maybe I’ll want it more to get fit one day… You spent six years in the illness? It’s a lot too but am glad it’s easier now for you, really Yeah, I find that I dwell a lot on the fact that I was sick since a small kid, but maybe some others were like me and this still makes of me a strong fighter lol maybe one day, I wont regret my past hah… thank you for the message lol"
176034299,"In the beginning, my psychosis was like this new world where everything was magical and this new reality opened up infinite possibilities. Signs were everywhere, and were guiding me. That period didn’t last long, and things took a nosedive pretty fast. The voices soon became persecutory, and friends and family turned into threatening people. That magical universe imploded, and suddenly everything became signs pointing to suicide. I don’t really miss being psychotic, as the chaos that came with it totally upended my life."

It’s long! its as long as a chapter in a book! I did it after staying up for 41.5hrs, and last night I got 7hrs of sleep, I feel rested.

174350536,That I have schizophrenia. I was in denial over twenty years believing it was real then reading this forum I saw other people with similar symptoms and it is thanks to this forum that I accepted my diagnosis. I nolonger have positives thankfully but am sensitive and should avoid stress and should have lots of time in bed .
174350537,"I’ve had schizophrenia for 4 years and I guess I’m still trying to get a hold on how this is going to go for me if I don’t end up dead. So I spent the past year or so believing that I was being watched by family with micro cameras and what not and I’ve had other delusions that tied into that (or not). I spent a night under a bridge after believing I couldn’t drink anything but tap water downtown and getting stuck after missing an appointment to my former script writer for Xanax. I finally realized there’s really nobody watching me and the vast majority of the things I believed are impossible. I went to my psychiatrist and got on medication, and now I feel fairly firm and grounded mentally. Does that go away again? The feeling that I have a grasp on my mind finally and what I believed previously was kind of ridiculous? For instance, do the voices just end up concocting another situation where I’m believing some ridiculous scenario and barely hanging onto my sanity? I read a lot about p
eople having periods where they aren’t doing well and lose control but then go back to having a grasp on things. Does it fluxtuate like that? Or do I get to keep my sanity at some point?"
176034348,"Yes i think.sometimes i just say that s it.tomorrow i m gonna finish this miserable life , but later i say thats ok you have to keep up your life this is your challenge.but its definitely relaxing at the end of it."
176034349,I am sociable enough that I got prescribed Propenol for dealing with other people. I say ‘how are you?’ to pretty much everyone that I am forced to deal with rather than saying hello and that gets a conversation off to a better start than avoiding eye contact and saying nothing.

176034370,"Just a warning, when you do try this, if you do fail it will take months to get back to normal again. My family and doctors all pressure me into taking my meds, and I really don’t like it at all. I never get any support when I quit meds, and everyone giving me ???? about it drives me crazy. You would be wrong to not expect people to tell you it’s a bad idea, as this med is a doctor decision so I have been told so many times before and shouldn’t be messed with unless they do it."

You’re afraid of making friends in your country because you’ve been hurt in the past, and you often have emotional reactions to hints of _USER_ID_ even if it isn’t directed at you because you convince yourself people will hate you.

176034380,I felt just awful on welbutrin. I only was on it for a short period and I became unstable and hostile. It started a mood episode. Definitely not a good med for me with my tendency toward mania on antidepressants. It’s too bad too because I need to quit smoking.
176034381,"My mother lives in Northern Norway and is planning to mive to Denmark next summer. I love her to death, but nortern norway is so rutal and small-town-mentality and stuff like that. Plus the psychiatric care in Norway is atrocious. My father lives in southern norway in a semi-small town. I’m sure both my parents would welcome me with open arms, but I don’t want to live in Norway and I don’t want to be a burden. I’m a grown person. I should be able to take care of myself with a little support"

176034384,That’s what I was like before antidepressants It’s a lack of joy the pdoc described it And a significant number of schizophrenics feel that way without ad’s It may turn your life around Give it a good go
176034385,It can be quite traumatic. Just know you’re not alone. I was convinced once that a giant 500ft Jesus sent me to Hell for thousands of years… “That’s another thousand years and another”. The only part of my psychotic episodes I fear and hate.
176034386,I have my lucid moments.
176034387,LS! I just did this _PERSON_.
174350550,I wonder when and how schizophrenia started. Did it start in monkeys?
176034388,"Actually, i did ask before if anyone wanted to share their story to go in a book. i didn’t get but three stories. Not enough to make the chapters needed. i abandoned the idea."
176034389,"They do. Also, I’m about at the final stages of my vigor as a man, and it’s hard to make gains in muscle when you’re over 60. I think I’ll work on developing my mind, but that will probably decline with age too."

176034392,I used to sleep long hours when I was in a high dose of meds. I guess I was asking how music makes you feel to see if it incites an emotional response…
176034393,"If you know each other well, it’s probably okay."
176034394,I’m so sorry for your loss.
176034395,Good. Do you have any symptoms? Are your meds working?
176034396,Yeah that’s pretty accurate as to how I felt. I had been in a really good mood but then my mood shifted pretty suddenly. (The tree is the good mood) all the black is the bad emotions. Not just one because all my emotions tangle together. _PERSON_ I look at why I’m feeling bad I see the black pool of emotions and how those affect me but it always feels like there’s something more that I cant reach and understand. It is extremely frustrating.
176034397,Thanks for asking! I did enjoy the movie but it was three hours long and I can’t sit that long in a chair. So today I am bedridden but I enjoyed being out with hubby. You are so sweet for thinking of me.
176034398,How can you be great without knowledge?
176034399,"Honestly i dont believe the _NAME_ wanted you dead your cousin telling you that might just have been joking or psychotic himself or u missheard him or that its self was a hallucination. Hearing someone wanted me dead would be enough to send me into a spiral of paranoia delusions and hallucinations. But i have also had experiences where i am looking directly at them and i hear them say something completely different and it has taken me years at times to realize i didnt become delusional because of what was said, i was already deluded and hallucinating when i thought it was said."
176034400,"_AT_MENTION_ I know how voices can be, but they will be around whether you do what they say or not, and the same for you. They can not physically hurt you or anyone else. Try to use your imagination to show them you are stronger. Imagine yourself as more powerful then them. Imagine pushing them away or putting them in a hole or out in space. My voices I can hear and see and sometimes I have to fight them. Imagine turning them to dust. All the best"

176034406,I just got a new interview at a warehouse. It’s on Saturday. It’s $11/hr and it’s a seasonal position.
176034407,The best place to start is a conversation with your pdoc. They know what you’ve tried in the past and they know what is likely the best thing for you to try now.
176034408,Are you making fun of my advice _AT_MENTION_ ? I’m only offering what works for me.
176034409,It’s possible. My health coverage will pay for a gym membership for me but I’m in California.
176034410,Very good _AT_MENTION_. I’m amazed at how talented our members are. Well done.
176034411,"I never got beat badly; when my parents did it they did it professionally and with precision. But seriously, the worst we got was a belt across the butt 3 or 4 times. The worst part wasn’t the actual hitting. The worst part was the anticipation. My dad always did the honors so during the day when my sisters or I did something and my mom caught us he would be at work and the worst part was waiting all day in terror knowing what we were going to get once he got home from work."
176034412,Gonna ask my pdoc about case manager are there any benefits of haveing one? I would like to get taken to my appointments that would be nice and perhaps a chat every now and then to see how I’m doing.

176034415,Am I the only one that gets very angry at the abuse the have suffered thru during their life? I get angry at people that wronged me in the past and I do get violent thoughts and I have threatened people and hurt some. My psychologist tells me I have a personality disorder. I am just mad that I am sick and I blame it on the abuse.
176034416,Glad you’re feeling better now.
176034417,"Yesterday I got really down and gave in to an urge I’d managed to fend off for several months – I checked the reincarnation subreddit, a place I kept up with faithfully for a while when I was at my worst because, in my mind, reading about reincarnation gave my suffering meaning. If my suffering is all part of some grand plan and I will come out the _NAME_ on the proverbial other side, then it all becomes worth it. But I would always take it to an unhealthy extreme and get lost in thinking about what could possibly await me after this life. This obsession led me to neglect responsibilities in this life. I don’t want to go back to that mental place. How can I overcome my attachment to otherworldly topics and pour everything I have into this life? Thanks for reading."

174350556,"Schizophrenia simplex, I think. He also used to smoke a lot of weed"
176034421,I would say this might be true for some. I was diagnosed at 17 although I started to show signs when I was 14. I recovered a lot but some people who were diagnosed at my age could be different.
176034422,I don’t think thats enough to be admitted.
176034423,"Yes, that’s why I do it too !"

176034424,"Do you think I am on medication or off it? Do you think I am on enough of it to sleep? Is it the correct medicine? Am I taking the correct Dosage? Do you want to tell me about what you are on and prescribe it to me in a chat forum? Dear little doctor, are you going to advertise on support site, which supplements you approve of? Dear Little doctors, are you being paid enough? Do you like your work and your clients? What do you need? Have you read _NAME_ book, “Insomnia”."
174350555,invasive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). One of my friend took this treapy later he start to forgot everything. So its kind of dangerous i think
176034425,I think St _NAME_’s wart is not meant to be used with antipsychotics.
176034426,My parents considered aborting me. I am imagining what it was like to be in mother’s womb while they were discussing it. No wonder I was obsessed with war. Very destructive ideas in my head.
176034427,but I do not understand how not to do that…
176034428,"I considered L-Tryptophan with Seroquel. At what point do these cause side effects if L-Tryptophan helps memory? I take 500 mg of Seroquel. I have been taking NAC, Beta-Alanine, L-Tyrosine and Melatonin."

176034431,"You need a med adjustment, that’s all. You have confirmation bias, so nothing I say will convince you."

176034444,yeah just have junk 1 day a week thats fine. just the other days keep it healthier
176034445,You may be feeling flat since your highs have been lowered. If you’ve had a lot of mania you might be missing the feeling of the high. I’ve been through that as mania as wild as it is was exciting. So learning to accept some form of normality as stability takes a long time to get used to.
176034446,It’s the calmness before the storm?
176034447,But who is the true self?
176034448,I want health and a good work ethic. That way I can make and keep wealth.
176034449,"Palo Alto had air and noise pollution. Because they had air pollution, new house constructions were forbidden from putting in a fireplace. Therefore, _NAME_ bought an old house and tore down everything but the fireplace and built his house around it. The family I visited had a lab that loved to go for a walk. One night the dog and I ended up right in front of the _NAME_ house. The trolley went through and made a hell of a noise. The crossings were deadly. Their park came with a mountain in it. I went to the top along the trail. I was a smoker back then! The AA meetings had some super stars . . . Fresh produce from all over the world was rushed to the grocery stores of Palo Alto. _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_!"

176034457,Mine feeling on this are confused. I feel like life and the world are plenty good. The bad comes from being wrong and taking from the worse way. When I am stuck then I want to quit. If I have a good way to keep going then I want to keep going. Yeah!
176034458,What you can do about traffic tickets is ask for a payment plan at court. Work out what you can pay. Same with medical debt. People will almost always accept a partial payment if they know the alternative is nothing.
176034459,I often get a laugh when you are being funny. Glad your appt went well.

176034460,"My father has shown a degree of guilt at my going to boarding school. That’s been in the last couple of decades, rather than when I was going there. To be fair it’s a tricky one for a father in the diplomatic service. Prep and public school provide educational continuity in a way that can’t be obtained in going to school wherever your father or mother are posted. It’s just that I wasn’t suited to it."
176034461,I’m aware others call my delusions delusions but they’re real to me.

176034464,"I have schizophrenia but because I fell into addictive behaviors it made everything more complicated for treatment. I’m pretty sure I have schizo-affective, which is depression and schizophrenia. But since I told people at rehab I had Bipolar and got a new psychiatrist I assumed I had Bipolar, and it would be ok to stop taking anti-psychotics. Then I became increasingly more manic and started self-medicating with drugs. So I think what came first is the mental illness that caused me to use drugs. Not the other way around. There are plenty of people who have “Schizophrenia” and use drugs that mask their symptoms. It’s a slippery slope and I wouldn’t recommend it. It’s hard to accept that you have a mental illness. But it’s better to consult a professional before experimenting on your own, or stopping medications. One thing about both Bipolar and Schizophrenia is that when symptoms go away people think they don’t need meds anymore. But that just means the meds are working. Sorry you h
ave to go through this, I would recommend not using any sort of street drugs because it can cause irreversible damage and make everything worse. Also I quit smoking weed because it triggers my impulsiveness and is psychoactive. So now I am working on being completely sober and sticking to a routine that won’t derail my health and wellbeing."

176034466,My mortgage and lot rent for my mobile home was $350/month. I think I paid my home off in 4 years time. That’s in West _NAME_ though. Mobile homes are built cheaply as I found out and nearly everything in my home needs repaired. Just something to think about.
176034467,I get these extremely vivid images in my head. They come on suddenly and involve really gory scenes of things around me or that I value. Like once I got one of my dog being burned alive in my apartment. I could vaguely hear her crying out too. It makes me really anxious. I cant really tell if its intrusive thoughts or hallucinations. I didnt get them until I developed sza.

176034508,"You need to talk with your psych doc and get proper meds to control your particular situation. I know delusions can be awful. I have had many delusions in the past such as the satellite communication to my head, but these are just delusions that can be minimized by psych meds. So just talk to your doctor."

176034515,Just curious what ap were you on to be able to lose so much weight
176034516,Yeah I do. What I am 50/50 on is whether I’ve had real interactions w them or if it was all psychosis
176034517,"They describe it as a similar disorder, but not the same I dont think."
176034518,I exercised half-involuntarily 7 days a week for almost 5 months now with some fatigue-lessening supplement and I feel a huge difference. My mood is better and I have more energy
176034519,My bipolar symptoms have faded out for the most part. I don’t know about pure schizophrenia but it seems like it can fade out as well. Meds are usually a permanent treatment.
176034520,Lol I thought this was a dream about _AT_MENTION_
176034521,In for a good time
176034522,I really am not sure. At this point in time. Apparently 50 percent go on without med out of people who get psychosis after initial med treatment I’ll bring up the source:

176034525,You shouldn’t think that. I think everyone appreciates your research and input. It’s extremely valuable.
174350578,Are you schizoaffetive? Bipolar type or depressive type? What meds do you take?
176034526,It worked great on 10mg but causes severe tiredness/sleepy. I’m looking forward to try prozac instead if that doesnt work out i will have to go back to lexapro

174350567,"I find it makes me happy to get out of my own head IRL and maybe help or encourage other people. I like it when some teenager or even younger or older look at me as the adult. I’m not used to it. But I like it when people look at me for approval or when someone cares if I like them or not. When I told my sister about this website I told her I give people advice and my experience. At first she didn’t think I was capable of it. But I told her that my experiences could help anyone, schizophrenic, non-schizophrenia or black or brown or an alien from mars. And she came around and could see that. And it just makes me feel useful and happy when I impart wisdom. I used to help my family all the time, I’ve housesat too many times to count. I drove my family and picked them up from the airport too many times to count too. I was so happy doing that and it wasn’t always easy but I loved giving back. I even helped my sister when she started her own business. My job was to rent a moving _NAME_, load it w
ith furniture and drive it to different houses and unload it. She paid me handsomely and depended on me and it was a lot of responsibility but I didn’t let her down and I came through. But…….I made one major mistake and it didn’t erase all I had done but it was the last time they asked me to drive them to the airport. It made me sad but it’s probably for the best for awhile. That was a few years ago. Well, once again they ask me for favors or minor help. Just this month my sister volunteered for the Democratic party and asked me to go to her apartment to feed and walk her dog while she was gone the whole day. And my other sister had me water her plants for one day while she was on a vacation. So I’m slowly rebuilding trust. I’ve grown up a lot in the last couple years and I told both my sisters that if there’s any way I can help them with my knowledge as long as it’s easy than ask me. But then I realized that I got my confidence back and I know that I am able to do harder things again. We sh
all see."

176034537,_AT_MENTION_ That sounds harsh man. Are you over that now? _AT_MENTION_ Do you think it’s possible for them to trigger an episode even when someone is on medication? I’ve been away for the weekend since Friday so I haven’t had the chance to watch anything dodgy and I took my medication with me. I’m back home now though and can feel the rays coming from the device at the school next door to me though. I’ve got to see my psychiatric nurse tomorrow in town so I’ll see if people are still harrassing me in my local town and village.

174350573,"Anger issues are common during the prodomal phase during the onset of schizophrenia or a number of different mental illnesses. It would help to get some exercise in. Whether kicking a football, or practicing martial art. This does not mean necessarily kicking another. One thing is, as we grow around young adulthood and suffer our first heartbreak, we go crazy. Some leave another for another and we feel left behind. This is can be attributed to why men develop schizophrenia earlier than women. The man loses the better half, another man goes around collecting things he wants but does not need, then the woman after feeling akin to a thing remembers the first man who spiraled for her and so she spirals realizing she wants to grow another piece of him. In any case, do not worry yet. The second man is often looking for another man, and thus no one is to blame alone. Do not give up.

I went along with alot of stuff I wouldn’t do today. He was eventually arrested for doing $20,000 worth of damage in one night with two of his friends. If you google hiw name the newspaper article still comes up. I wonder how he’s doing I can’t find him on facebook."

176034627,Could be any number of things. Relax. Take stock and maybe avoid for a bit. Stress seems to be the number one trigger for most folks. Are you stressing over anything? That is where I’d start. I can seem a reasonable human being most times but add some stress and some anxiety and paranoia moves in…and paranoia can be so insidious. Do something that relaxes you would be my advice. Avoid the trigger for a time…

But after 12 hours my brain was cloudy and I couldn’t remember anything or think straight at all so I went and immediately took Zoloft again. It’s only a matter of time till I attempt to stop them again. Maybe it’ll be 2 years from now. And maybe it’ll only be for 12 hours. But considering the first thing I do is wake up take my meds. There’s no way of forgetting for me. It’s my routine. But eventually I will ATTEMPT and FAIL at coming off my meds, once again. “Maybe it’ll be different this time” And the thing is they work so well for me with such few side effects. STILL I think to come off them. Fn crazy maybe. But I try to be fair and mindful and recognize my uncomfortableness so damage will be controlled at a minimum."

When the police arrived, they told me to throw aside the knife and they went in to inspect. After awhile, they called me inside and asked me if I recognized the shoes. Upon closer inspection, I said I did and I confirmed that they were indeed my shoes. The police then told me that people were calling in to the station to complain that a lady was standing outside the apartment complex with a knife scaring everyone. The police told me that the next time something like this happens to me to go to the apartment office. I told them that the office was closed. They then told me to go to a neighbor.

174350608,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . I hope you are feeling better today. Some users have been coming to us feeling triggered by your username. We don’t allow religious discussions on this site. This for a couple of reasons. First, it tends to cause arguments, because for some reason people can’t seem to just respect each other’s different religious beliefs. Second, many folks suffer from religious delusions. It is one of the top three topics of delusion, alongside aliens and government conspiracies. We don’t allow discussions on those topics, either. Third, there are many members here who were subjected to exorcisms by family members who, sadly, did not understand their illness. Those memories can be very traumatic for those individuals, and they don’t need to be reminded of them. For this reason, I would like to ask you to pick a different username. It can be any non-religious, non-offensive username you choose, with the exception of your actual name. I hope you can understand, and help keep this a saf

I feel I am back to square one again Just had to refund over £3,300 deposit I have held for a project for nearly 3 months, and sacrifice a job that I would have earned good money doing so. There are many reasons behind this business decision, with mental health being at the forefront. Now I am questioning my long term financial circumstances whilst balancing the need to prevent further deterioration in my mental state I got so much interest in my business last year, and I let it carry me away with my delusion that I was going to make lots of money and do great things. Now reality has bitten again with more mental health setbacks, and I have lost all confidence in myself.

176034703,"I remember when I was hooked on drugs. My friends tended to con me to get beer because I was the only one working and they screwed me over a little. But I screwed them over a little too. But I just remember how great it was to have friends when I was in my studio on the 4th of July at night when I was about 27 and feeling alone and depressed and my friend knocked on the door with a bag full of firecrackers and we walked to the park and spent an hour lighting them off and having a good time. Or when I was in this same studio and a friend (who happen to be a “normie”) knew I was broke and going hungry a lot of the time and he worked in a Japanese restaurant and one night he stopped by and brought me a garbage bag full of rice and a big bucket of teriyaki chicken. He just gave it to me for free. And later when I got fired from my four year job he got me hired on at his restaurant. Then another friend had an opening at the restaurant where he worked as a waiter that paid more so I consulted my frie
nd who brought me the rice and he understood and I quit and went to the other restaurant. My third friend was a couple years younger than me and I really shouldn’t have been friends with him, he was cool and had way more status than me but we were pretty good friends. I took him to a party this girl at work threw and I was having a good time. But I didn’t dance and some people were dancing so I was standing there trying to look cool and the friend came over and told me, man, the girl who had the party was checking me out and one or two other girls were checking me out too but I was so worried about looking cool that I didn’t notice. No friend I had in high school would ever have tried to help me or build me up or treat me as good as they did. And the guy who was the waiter did a few things like that too. My friends in high school would try to tear me down instead of build me up. Later, the waiter turned on me and said some really bad things about me to my other friend behind my back. The friend told me 
what he said and he said the guy was talking about me like I was an animal. It shocked him and he said, “_NAME_, we try to con you into getting us beer sometimes but we don’t think of you like that, we respect you.” And he meant it. So I never appreciated having friends more then in those days. In 1990 I moved into a board & care home. I ended up living there 5 years and after about two years this guy moved in and we hit it off and became friends. He was ten years younger than me but we became good friends and he started attending AA meetings with me. He was another friend who tried to build me up. He said some nice things about me and I helped him too. So all these friends weren’t nice all the time but I accepted that"

I sometimes feel like sz should be labelled differently, it should focus on what debilitates you into psychosis and positive symptoms should be left out of the dx completely. It affects the way I maintain myself and the way I socialize. My thoughts just dont go in the same direction like other people and like they are supposed to. I might have overcome everything to do with psychosis, but I am far from standing on my own two feet again in life like I am supposed to be."

174350631,"No one cares about you, because we don’t know you, and no one is watching you. It would be a horrible world if we all watched you. It’s a symptom of schizophrenia. People on tv couldn’t care less about you because they don’t know you. You have 100% privacy and no one is watching you. I felt the same way. It’s a horrible feeling."
174350640,"I had 2 schizophrenic friends, they’re twins. They have severe erotomania, one think that a random stripper he just met in a stripclub is in love with him, he brought her flowers and chocolate, she was like wtf when she looked at him. He didn’t even spoke with her and he tells me that she told him that he’s cute and that she wants to date him. Their sz is much worse than all ppl here, they talk to their body parts like hands, they talk to themeselves and they even talk to walls and objects. They’re not mentally fit to talk on forums. I feel sad for them, I would have introduced this forum to them. I always say thank god that I am not like them."

176034764,"I like money. I need to keep my lifestyle and pay my bills and have money left over for entertainment and small luxuries. To have these things I’ll put up with occasional bulls*it and work jobs I don’t like. This is my rational for going to work. Besides, this may sound impossible or rare but the company I work for is a nice company. Really. They hire the disabled and veterans and bend over backwards to accommodate us. They put up with some of the crap my co-workers pull. And me too sometimes. I had attendance problems and tardiness problems other employers I’ve worked for in the past would have just fired me. But they discussed it with me and changed my hours to make it easier to get there on time. Anyways, believe me, it’s a nice company. Anyways, I’ve gone through the arguments with other posters about how work should be abolished, what a stupid institution it is, etc. Yawn, I got sucked into the other guys ridiculous opinions on work. He had me going there for a minute. He laid out an 
argument that he thought was the definitive proof that work was a big waste of time, no one should ever do it, that no one in history should ever have worked etc. That his opinion was the only right one and that the billions and billions of people in all of history who have ever worked were wrong and that he was right. I ain’t talking about you _AT_MENTION_, I already stated my rational for working and that’s how I justify working. Work, can be noble though. I’ve had bosses I’ve hated before, I’ve had employers who I liked such as my current one, and I’ve had employers I was ambivalent about. Nothing wrong with being self-employed if that’s what you want and you can do it. Lots of people start their own businesses for the exact same reasons you laid out."

Sure some smart people in history were cream of the crop and really stood out. I mean people like _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ or _NAME_. But if you read world history, it isn’t just a few smart people in history. There were many great thinkers, many great architects, many great lawyers, inventers etc. People who did some really great work in their time and stood out but maybe not as smart as _PERSON_ or _NAME_. To say there’s only a few smart people per century is generalizing and is dead wrong. Just an example from my last class was when the Enlightenment and the Renaissance was going on there were all kinds of great people like artists, people building beautiful churches, philosophers, scientists, doctors, etc. all doing great stuff that changed the world. If you want to look specifically at schizophrenics, I th

When I was at home I would go and check my pill box if I was feeling bad and thought I might have forgotten my meds. I still use it but if I can’t remember whether or not I took my meds in the morning and i feel bad at work I will take them.
176034795,"Regarding psychiatrist and psychotropic drugs, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, Abilify worked very well for me almost immediately. However… Before my accident, my doctor put me on 150 mg of Effexor. I found it gave me blurred vision, great difficulty in focussing, which really did not work well for my job at the time which was computer programmer, and made me very moody. About a year and three months after my accident, I basically got raped by my insurance company and had a nervous breakdown. The psychiatrist forced me to take Effexor, despite the fact I told him how negative side effects were for me, and said that if I did not take my meds he would do a blood test and send the results to the insurance company to show that I was being non-compliant with medical orders. That would have meant me being cut off, and probably homeless within one month After eight years of weaning off that crap, I found 5-HTP which actually boosts serotonin levels, rather than just messing with them in your head. I
t is the solution, rather than chasing the symptom around for the rest of your life. Take it for what it is, this has been my own experience of our medical system and psychiatric drugs The other thing that scares me about schizophrenia medication in general, is that a lot of them seem to work on your dopamine levels, which can have an impact on your mood. I refuse to go back into the depression that I crawled out of. It took me too damn long to get this far Just my two cents"

It’s simply a question of: Did Space-Time begin with the “Big Bang”? Is Space-Time really just a “Potential Time Singularity”? I can’t prove Imaginary-Time exists, but it clears up the math for the “Big Bang” gang, and provides a time dimension for “Potential Time Singularities” to exist in."

It doesn’t sound like much but it involved aspects of landscaping and I did some pretty big projects (for a kid of 16 or 17) that I was rather proud of. I did miscellaneous stuff like cutting down a pine tree and cutting it into firewood, digging out trees including the roots, cleaning gutters on houses, clearing brush out of a rather large horse stable, digging ditches, building sidewalks, and other projects. I did work for people at my church regularly and I kept getting new customers.

Thus its very useful for remaining busy during the day, for workouts etc. It doesn’t cause cognitive, memory issues, libido issues like SSRI, anti psychotics and it even improves it.

174350724,"Listen — in my personal experience nearly everyone with schizophrenia has a few common traits (at least) and delusions – A demon or evil voice speaks to us The government is supposedly always conspiring against us We see signs and visions broadcasting our thoughts We see things written everywhere we go like people are out to get us Paranoia of things that don’t matter For me, my life is a living hell with every amount of terror you can think of (demons or angels?) And government conspiracy And of course regular TV talking to me I could go on and on over this topic all day but to this day, ive been brought to my realization that this is spiritual as well as psychological — demons and angels can be real - and everyone is Kidding themselves into believing it’s all science and can be treated (sweep under the rug type deal) We look for things to calm us and trick ourselves into faking it. All I can say is I’m not an expert what goes on in this world but I can say there might be some truth in

I’m no saint so I’m not too great at it but I’m alright I think. In my class my teacher said a rock and roll star or actor said he used to beat up minorities in the 50s or 60s for fun but he later regretted his behavior and told the whole world what he did and how he was at fault. My teacher said it was important and even admirable he did that.
176035074,"and they either minimize it by telling me they experience the same things or they tell me that my symptoms are the result of Satanic attack and that I need to fight Satan with Scripture and prayer. In other words, my family is completely nonunderstanding and unsupportive. My family is not Catholic. They are evangelical."
176035075,"Inhaling any foreign substance into your lungs is not good. It might be “safer” than smoking, but it’s still not good.

But I’m not gonna tell you what to do – you’re a grown ass man who can make his own decisions."

176035080,"I got to try a tank two or three times (for free) back around 1985 or 86. I had heard all the hype and this was the eighties so the movie “Altered States” was on everybody’s mind. I was actually let down by the experience. Ours was a big white tank with a swinging door that you crawled through. I was actually still somewhat psychotic but when I climbed in it was anti-climatic. First of all, it didn’t scare me at all. Then it was just basically floating in warm water quietly. I got bored and I didn’t have any great insights or any great meditative state. It was relaxing but that was about it. I will say though that my boss, who was in his late thirties got carried away with “taking a float” as we called it and went inside an hour a day every day for a month and he told us he started hallucinating. That was extreme though, most people who liked those just do it a couple times a month. But that cured him of using it too much, lol. Incidentally, in 1985 we charged $20.00 to use it for an 
hour and a half."
176035081,"In all honesty, I think about stopping them every now and then. But I know that I shouldn’t."
176035082,"Now that I recognize my symptoms after stabilizing sz with 4mg Risperdal, I think I sometimes get mania symptoms that stop after taking my AP at night. Mania symptoms only happen after 3pm as AP blood lvl decrease. To test this I split my 4mg into 2mg at night and 2mg at noon. Definitively pushed manic symptoms to just an hour or less before taking my AP and now it happens much less, maybe 2-3x a week. Problem is that the AP worsen my negative symptoms. Do mania meds do the same? I am thinking maybe reducing my Risperdal to 2x 1.5mg and take a mood stabilizer at the same time. I read that APs are also used to treat mania so my theory is correct about having mania when AP blood lvl is low. I need to apply for a new psychiatrist though as now I have none."
176035083,"But I DON’T WANT TO, ITS NOT ME IT’S HIM. Why does he want my husband dead? Why can’t he tell me to kill a fly or cockroach or something? Instead of putting evil into my mind foreign infection. I am too scared to look my husband in the eye because he will read _PERSON_’s thoughts he will see into my mind and be scared just like me … at the monster inside of me… I wish I could kill _PERSON_ but I can’t as he’s a spirit. Distract distract distract all I can do. Alienitis infection haha! That’s what it is - Alienitis. It’s scary because he says I’m a murderer and I’m not. It’s so distressing to have evil thoughts being placed in my head about my husband and at same time love him and want all the best for him. At least it’s not 24/7 mercifully not but still it’s upsetting as those things he says stay in my mind almost all day. Every time I want to hug my husband I’m being reminded of _PERSON_’s thought to kill. I…I wanna cry…I love my husband so much…I don’t wa
nt Alien to hurt him… makes me wanna cry… think maybe kill myself first but I’m scared…maybe go to hell and I don’t want to… I’m so stuck Hope I can forget about it if I distract myself enough"

174350728,"Actually I think I am putting a better spin on my condition than the reality. I say I travel to hells and help people to rise out of them. In fact it seems that I can barely help myself out of them, let alone other people, but by helping myself I do help other people I think. Perhaps this reasoning is wrong. I want to help other people, but at present the only way I can do that is by helping myself, by making sure that I cause the least disruption in life. I have been very disruptive when relapsing in the past, but my parents say I am getting better. The relapses always feel as bad as each other, the hells always feel as traumatic, but I am getting better at not being so disruptive when I am in them, that is according to my parents. So this perhaps is progress. I want to help people, and I still feel like I want to live a life with a higher status. My status as mentally ill prevents me from starting a family to my mind, but then so do the realities of being mentally ill. As I said, I find it hard e
nough to help myself, let alone look after other people. The only way I can help other people at present is through helping myself. Does that make sense? I want to move on, but I am still caught in the idea that progress comes through dreaming, and I have still been relapsing, dreaming hells and nightmares, instead of heavens, though when I am sane, my life is pretty good. When I think about it, I think that my sane life must be a dream too, so if only I could dream an even better life, I would be in paradise, but the truth is I treat my sane life as real most of the time. I also treat the psychotic relapses as real, which is why I find it so hard to get out of them. I know that life is a dream, but I forget it, and treat what I dream as real. On the other hand, knowing that it is a dream prevents me from doing anything much other than express myself because I don’t see the point in contributing to something that is not real. Dreams seem to come from consciousness which is why I express myself, trying to gu
ide my consciousness to dream good things. This is the way in which I help myself. But I seem stuck, not going anywhere, until I relapse again, and go back into the hells. How can I rise? How can I produce something of worth in the real world? How can I not see myself as a failure? How can I get into the position to have a family? These are the questions I ask myself. Thank you."

Animals fall asleep and some cry for food on the nest. Snow becomes water for the ground and the ground seeks more, And the ocean brings life to many, but it also kills the souls that swim in. In the vast land I have never been to, the blood of my ancestors is spilled on churches And their descendants build upon the resting place of their passion. The wheels of a broken wheelchair sits as three people try desperately to fix it, Only for the three people to equally divide parts as the disabled person try to move. And so does a woman who sits upon a computer, who loves the wind, The gentle touches of the keyboard and the subtle music from her speakers, Cries upon the screen as she weeps upon the hatred from her own 
people. And so does a child who sits upon a bed watches carefully of her caregiver To watch her every act in fear as he cries below his blanket. And so does an elderly man who have raised his children with fervor Asks for a cup of food, but only to be refused; So he retreats, calls his children, only to be rejected from them. And so does the wave of the nature flows beneath and over us, The mountain stays still, the rocks remaining unbroken, the animals roaming the earth, The nature seemingly silent and poised on its dedication for its lives."

176035208,"The last time I lived with one of my parents I was 29. They had split up and my dad was staying with a friend who had an extra room. I had just got fired from my job and kicked out of my housing for being behind on rent for three months. So I had nowhere to go so I got that spare bedroom. Did I mention I was going through a relapse? Yeah, a nasty relapse, ended up in the hospital a few times. My dad and his friend went to their seperate jobs about 8:00 am and I was alone in the house all day with almost no money. I went through some bad mental crap at that time. So I applied for a day program. Got accepted so I went there for awhile. I was about 29 years old and we played board games and cooked lunch and played vollyball out back and played ping pong. I was in bad shape. The only good thing about that program was that I made a friend there. He had his own problems. I remember he told me he had been in jail a month or two for (–content deleted by moderator–) He really didn’t seem like the type 
of person who would do that. He seemed like a nice guy; very social and friendly. I went to the program and then one day my dad said, “Why don’t you go out and get a job?” So I did. I did recycling for two or three months and then quit and got a job in a warehouse. It was interesting, it was OK. It was funny because I worked there for a few months and kind of kept to myself. I was addicted to crack at the time and one day this young guy asked me about it. I thought I was cool but I didn’t think I was as cool as my co-workers but one day, this 22 year old kid took an interest in me and we started talking and I guess I impressed him and we became friendly. But just a couple of weeks later I was there and at lunch time I left without telling anyone and never went back. It was a shame, it was right when people were starting to be friendly to me. Anyways, a lot of bad stuff was happening to me, I was in really bad shape. But I lived with my dad for about 5 months until I needed to go into a temporary group 
home. Got clean while I was there. Moved into a nice board & care home, stayed clean and changed my life into work, school and being responsible."

176035298,"A consensus has not yet been reached regarding the accuracy of people with schizophrenia in self-reporting their real-life functioning. In a large ( n = 618) cohort of stable, community-dwelling schizophrenia patients we sought to: (1) examine the concordance of patients’ reports of their real-life functioning with the reports of their key caregiver; (2) identify which patient characteristics are associated to the differences between patients and informants. Patient-caregiver concordance of the ratings in three Specific Level of Functioning Scale (SLOF) domains (interpersonal relationships, everyday life skills, work skills) was evaluated with matched-pair t tests, the _PERSON_’s concordance correlation, _PERSON_’ D , and _PERSON_–Altman plots with limits of agreement (LOA). Predictors of the patient-caregiver differences in SLOF ratings were assessed with a linear regression with multivariable fractional polynomials. Patients’ self-evaluation of functioning was higher than caregivers’ 
in all the evaluated domains of the SLOF and 17.6% of the patients exceeded the LOA, thus providing a self-evaluation discordant from their key caregivers. The strongest predictors of patient-caregiver discrepancies were caregivers’ ratings in each SLOF domain. In clinically stable outpatients with a moderate degree of functional impairment, self-evaluation with the SLOF scale can become a useful, informative and reliable clinical tool to design a tailored rehabilitation program. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-021-00140-9?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+npjschz%2Frss%2Fcurrent+(npj+Schizophrenia)"

But they say nice things to me and really mean it. They give me a hard time sometimes but you have to take the good with the bad and when they give me hard time I just laugh it off and then they treat me even cooler. One of them started calling me “Hollywood” because of my sunglasses. Then today I was near the janitors office and one guy was walking by and he stopped and asked if I’m OK and asked me if everything is alright. I could tell he was sincere. For a second I almost told him of my problems but I just said my usual, “I’m OK.” I wasn’t tempted to mention schizophrenia at all but I kinda wished I would have told him how I’m really doing because I’m struggling and I would have liked to get it off my chest. I guess it was my stupid pride holding me back, but there’s been a few of the soldiers who 
sincerely care enough to try to be nice and lend an ear to my problems if I want to tell them. But if I wasn’t nice and cool people wouldn’t be as nice as they are to me. I can thank my parents for that. Warning: Male chauvinist pig alert ** One of the last things I did today was dust off the treadmills and weight machines. There was one soldier who I’m usually friendly with but we were kind of getting on each others nerves today while we both were in the gym. It led to a little staring and glaring. I don’t even know what really went wrong but there was also one of the woman soldiers working out who was about my age. I had never seen her work out before and she was wearing something that made her a little sexy looking to me. She’s almost always grumpy and short with me but after bugging that soldier I was feeling my oats and I started obviously checking her out. Not too much, but boy, for some reason she looked very appealing. But then it stopped and I said something friendly to her but she just poi
ntedly ignored me and looked mad and didn’t talk and I gathered that she doesn’t like me. It was really no big deal.Oh well, who cares? She’s never nice to me anyways and it just means one less Christmas card I have to send out this year.

One day all those symptoms became unbearable because of their intensity. It was then when I started to visit a psychiatrist. I looked for schizophrenia on Google and I realized I was having all the symptoms described on there. Then I was hospitalized and during the hospitalization the psychiatrist told me my diagnosis: Paranoid schizophrenia.

Anyway, one of them has a specific way everything must be done at a certain time in a certain way every time he works. He gets upset when I’m not doing what in his mind the other person should be doing. But today was only my third day. So I need him to communicate with me and he doesn’t do it. I resorted to asking him what he’d like me to do all night tonight. It seemed ok like that but he still seemed stressed. The other autistic guy just goes off and does stuff again without communicating with me. What’s the best way I can handle this with these guys?"

Eg. one psychiatrist wrote in his report that I’m having “psychotic thoughts” about multiple personalities, even though that is only accepting my disorder. Likewise, visiting a parallel reality would sound crazy to many people, because you really have to see it to believe it. I don’t think it is taking it far. It’s just a way to back up what I’m saying, which is important, because I rarely feel they are listening to me or taking me seriously. Often it seems they are lacking in empathy. -A."

Or/ what the nature of main change in the psychological substance ? As we say,the things be called hallucinations in itself is the change (mutation) that occurs in the inherited psychological substance It means,the hallucinations is the psychological mutation which linking with the inherited psychological self and has seeks to be a natural part from the human psycho

176035416,"It can rob you of your ambition, motivation and will power, I agree. It can also serve the purpose of hiding trauma in your mind, trauma you don’t even realise you had. The fact is that the correlation between those who have been traumatised are more likely to smoke, and the possibility that cannabis causes sz are likely to be highly in favour to the traumatised. The traumatised are more likely to get sz. It is correlation not causation."

174350804,"UPDATE: A snippet from my journal. Enjoy. 12/11/19 12:31pm I had a migraine or something yesterday at work. I had to go home and rest. I hope and pray it doesn’t happen again. I think I’m a deep thinker. I’ve been thinking deeply for a while now and I’ve come to this conclusion. It’s just who i am. I’m proud of who I am today. I really get out there and get it done. Aside from my work permit holding me back haha. Oh well weekend approaches! Friendsgiving probably a happening for me at a friends. My roommate and I talked about my medical history last night. I told him lots of info. I wanted this to happen, we sat down and I was honest with him. He told me some things too. It was a good heart to heart convo. I feel blessed to have such a good listener as my roommate. I go through troubling times sometimes, with my illness, so it’s nice at least to have someone hear you through. I accept my schizoaffective disorder. I know it has been hard to come to terms with in the past but I need to 
see it for what it is. It means I need a little wiggle room on some cognitive and quality of life areas. Such as thinking. I should not interact with the voices, I should ignore them because they are not real. They also are very unfriendly sometimes, so I have no reason to trust them. Specific voices come through every now and then and I name them but even this is somewhat of an interaction. I suppose minimizing these interactions and focusing on my real, good social circles and family will help me the most. And God is great! I want to read the Bible more. Maybe I will go do that now. Enough journaling for now. 2:20 pm I ended up eating breakfast and doing chores instead of reading the Bible. Perhaps tonight I will get to it. It’s really inspiring hearing His word in biblical parables. I’m gonna do my best to work today. Wish me luck! Peace. 9:00pm I think I just overthink things. I also think I am susceptible to other illnesses because of my pre-existing condition. Like colds, flu, any ailments hit me li
ke tenfold it seems. Maybe this is why I’m a health nut. Eating healthy, exercising, being careful about what I put into my body. I need to pay my school! I am pro psychiatry. Although, I see where the anti-psychiatry movement comes from. No one wants to follow such strict orders and medicine regimen. But it [medicine] keeps me alive and happy. Everything is connected. A healthy balance is necessary. Don’t do anything dumb. Honor God. Glorify Him. Be with friends and family as much as possible. “Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain.” A motto that applies to life well is “Be prepared.” This is also the Boy Scout motto. I loved Scouting."

176035489,"Remember that good friends mostly want to spend time with you, but a good way to get to know someone is by helping them out. I used to drive my best friend to school every day back when we were just acquaintances. After awhile we got close and now we just go grocery shopping together weekly to just hang out. If someone asks you to help them, help them, but if they won’t help you back it is good to drop them."

176035503,I completely agree. When the pandemic started I was in my college statistics class and I completely stopped learning when it all went online.

176035505,"I dont know…i have been thinking why it hurt me so. It is just…however hard i try…im never going to be a normie. People notice im different. That i make weird mistakes like that.

I just really really want to be normal."
176035506,"I feel having a routine really helps. If I know I have to cook dinner at 7, bursh my teeth when I get up, and shower in the mornings on mondays, wednesdays and fridays, it’s easier for me to get it done"
176035507,"Well, the good news is that I don’t feel “stuck with them.” My family are all nice, and fun to be around. My complaint is that I’m not around them enough. But it’s completely my own fault. My family has gone way beyond the call of duty to help me ever since I got ill and I wish there was some big way to repay them. I had a good start by driving them to the airport and picking them up on their numerous travels, housesitting while they were gone and feeding their animals, and doing yardwork and helping them move multiple times but that’s just a drop in the bucket compared to what they’ve done for me over the course of 40 years."

176035552,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton, you’ve really got to accept things like the need for medicine. You only want pills so you can stop taking your med. You’re violent when psychotic so that’s unacceptable. You need the shots, plain and simple"

176035581,Does your nurse know about this? maybe a med adjustment might help
176035582,I know what you’re going through. My upstairs neighbors harass me some of it may be going on but I don’t want to talk about it. I just do my best to ignore it. Don’t worry. You’ll drive yourself crazy if dwell on it. Too much. Headphones and music.

176035584,"I find it helpful to label what I have felt sometimes, and it is “suffering.” I am not sure how to use that word.

Also hated needing to eat 500+ calories with it Risperidal- First AP I tried. Helped more than Geodon did but it was very sedating and made me gain 25lbs in a month. I was switched off of it. Invega- Was only on it for a week, made me gain 5lbs in that week. I refused to stay on it"

176035592,How do you mean?
176035593,Man I’ve been struck by a bout of nightmares recently too. The dreams where you can still hear and understand what’s happening around you but’s also still sleepy enough to still dream are the worst. I’m sorry you’re dealing with that.

176035602,Thanks for the information. I’m not sure what to expect at this point. Especially since I’ve been to a psychatric center for an assessment earlier this summer and I was referred to counseling or crisis. I think I need to get a second opinion.
176035603,I’m currently on 156mg invega sustena and I often don’t feel very good and get completely exhausted from doing small things should I try a different med?

176035605,"I get very bizarre ones. I can hear things, see things and feel things. Sometimes it even feels like something is moving me around like I even get proprioceptive hallucinations. I was hallucinating while half asleep just today and felt something swallowing me whole. Then felt something moving my body around even though I was not moving in reality. I could see the entire room through my closed eyes and shadow figures in it. I could feel some sexual sensations as well."
176035606,Yes I just started a 6 session course of cbt. My main aim is self confidence since low self confidence creates anxiety and long term anxiety contributes to psychosis. We are going to tackle ways for me to feel good about myself even when I’m overweight and not conventionally attractive due to certain private things. That’s the main thing to get rid of feeling so insecure.
176035607,"Do you think I should talk to them again? I left it yesterday that if they didn’t contact me, that’s it. They didn’t get in contact."
176035608,"I had a psychiatrist tell me that he believes there is divine intervention in my life etc. I personally also prefer a more scientific approach to things. I’m looking into seeing someone else. If she respects the fact that you don’t want to dabble in that area, then perhaps she will maintain he professionalism and help you as she is supposed to. If you find she wants to continue down this line of thinking then definitely see someone else."

I had to have my shrink fill some out but I never got the forms to him. And I had to have a ""third party’ fill some out so I had my sister fill them out. I was like a month late getting them back but I get a letter from my local Social Security office a week ago saying they determined my disability is “continuing”. Meaning my benefits will not stop. And I called Social Security and asked them if I still needed that stack of forms filled out. The guy said, “Well, you should have filled them out a long time ago but we’ll overlook it this time and you don’t need to send them in.” Then he said that I’ll be reviewed again in a few years and I better fill them in the next time. Whew, what a relief! I’ve had this situation hanging over my head since mid-November."
176035611,Plus I’m on a lower dose now

Nicotine is also known to cross the blood brain barrier and deposits in teens as young as 13 have shown metal deposits in the temporal and parietol (sp) lobes. I used to do stop smoking seminars as an elementary teacher, in the inner city smoking was very prevalent in the preteen/teen culture. The info I used to use came from the American Lung Association, try contacting them for additional references."

174350840,"They say they either don’t know or are not allowed to tell me why I’m going to be tortured, but they have 2 theories: First is that because I’m stupid (my schizophrenia has proven to be more intelligent than I am, and is better at problem solving). They say a stupid person could cause trouble if I reincarnated in the extraterrestrial (alien) society, and according to that theory an eternal torture would prevent me from reincarnating there, and instead will keep me stuck in that state of torture forever. The 2nd theory is that I was chosen to get this “schizophrenia” randomly. According to this theory my schizophrenia controlled my mind my entire life to reduce my intelligence and make me make stupid mistakes in order to generate guilt, which will be necessary to keep me in a state of torture after death. The reason to keep me in the state of torture is for some unknown spiritual purposes. One theory is that force to move and control “UFO”-s comes from gods (which is how they can move 
faster than the speed of light). By controlling the minds of the gods the ET-s can effectively control a large amount of space crafts at once, but to successfully keep the gods under constant mind control the gods have to suffer unbearable torture. My schizophrenia’s activity is supposedly also focused on generating guilt. They’ve accused me of many things I did wrong in my life due to stupidity, which supposedly will make me feel guilty after death. Now they speak mostly about my irrational behavior, and every irrational thing I do supposedly increases my guilt, which will decrease my chances of escaping the torture after death. They’re small things, but I’ve been told after death I’m going to be made to believe that I’m only supposed to act rationally - if I don’t, I deserve the torture. Neither of those theories can be refuted until our science is sufficiently advanced to be able to examine and understand the spiritual world."

Of course I’ve matured a great deal. I’ve taken breaks from using a lot and had long periods of sobriety in my 12 years crazy life. But I see my delusions in high school functioning the same as an alcoholic does. Just couldn’t make any progress, growth in life. for me alcoholism and getting clean from it has matured me just As much as delusions…and learning about life by dealing with them Can anyone else with addiction/delusion issues relate to me that addiction is kindve a similar escape/coping mechanism to alcoholism Feel free to tell me you completely disagree.

176035672,I was diagnosed with sz in 2015. Used to smoke up weed heavily but somehow it just clicked and I quit smoking weed in Feb 2016. I just realized the damage it was causing me and frankly were it not for me to quit weed I would still be in a psyche ward with my brain totally damaged to the worst. Never touched weed again and don’t have the craving either. Even when some of my friends smoke up and invite me I politely decline their offer. I feel I am very lucky in this regard. Now I am starting to think if I can quit weed cold turkey why can’t I quit cigarrettes cold turkey. I can do it if I wanted to do it with conviction.

It helps you learn to manually activate your prefrontal cortex (where logical thinking happens) and shut down your limbic system (where panic and emotional responses happen) so you can easily re-exert control over your brain when it starts to spiral."

176035745,"Back in 1988 during a nasty relapse, I was staying with my dad. He had a 1970 Cadillac and he spent more than $1500.00 putting brand new, steel belted tires on it. He used to lend me his car often and one day I drove quite a few miles to get to the city where I got my crack. I wanted some crack but I had no money so I was just l kind of aimlessly driving around, hoping I would get high somehow. I ran into a guy who I had partied with a couple times. He was driving a large car too and he made me an offer. He had a lousy tire on his car and he said he would give me one rock of crack if I traded tires with him. I jumped at the chance. This is why you don’t do drugs. We pulled over and exchanged tires. Then he said he would give me three rocks if I traded all my tires. Again, I didn’t even think about it that long before saying yes. We drove to his house to change the tires. The thing was, that he had on different wheels and hubcaps on all his tires so I had four completely different wheels on my d
ads Cadillac; they didn’t match each other. This is why you do not want to become an addict. I did other messed up s*it like that too. When I got my dads car home I thought that somehow he would not notice he had on different tires. And he actually didn’t notice for three days. He discovered it one day and he didn’t get mad. He had a really bad temper but with this tire situation he was just very, very disappointed in me. I felt like crap, like the lowest form of life. I felt really bad. It wasn’t enough to make me stop smoking crack though."

I’m happy I am able to orgasm but I’m not good at giving them to myself. It’s a boring orgasm when I give it to myself and not worth my while on it. I don’t masturbate. Boring short non intense orgasm with myself. I want a partner that I can have intimate ecstatic sex with and who is stable and cool.

It was 125/94; it was down significantly from a week ago when I saw my nurse for my injection, when it was 152/108. A diastolic pressure of 94 is a little high, but certainly better than it was, and a systolic pressure of 125 is actually quite healthy. The difference was that I avoided nicotine for an hour leading up to my appointment. I knew my pressure would be lower, just didn’t realize it would be that big of a difference.

Go somewhere and get a little space. Get out in nature. It ain’t going to solve all your problems but it might help. I used to have a therapist who based his whole method on encouraging his clients to do something fun once in awhile. He claimed that is what most of his clients had in common, they never have fun. So he encouraged people to have fun.

But here I am and I’m home safe and sound. My problem is I still hear CIA voices and now they are saying that they are gonna abduct me from home once I settle in and think all is well.

Crazy stuff like that went on in my mind for over 10 years. Quite the movies. _PERSON_ brought the movies to a close.

My stepdaughter has been very good when it comes to that. There’s a tendency to automatically believe ability is very even when it comes to crystallised and fluid intelligence . That is indeed true for the vast majority of people. However for a minority of us it’s not true. Non recognition of the issue results in terms like bolshy/contrary/lazy/passive aggressive etc being used against such an individual .

176035925,They film me too. I have a reality show upon my life
176035926,Yeah I remember early on that the voices kept asking questions and touching on certain subjects. If it bothered me they persisted. If not they dropped the subject.
174350905,It’s just that clozapine is best known for med resistant sz and has much lower levels of relapse. If my doctor put me on it I would be a lot more comfortable moving out of my parents house.
176035927,I too have started taking iron tablets thinking of my fatigue tired feeling. But when my ferritin levels checked (iron in blood) its way above normal. So need to be very careful when taking iron supplements as body cannot expel it easily and get deposited on various organs. For me the reason for fatigue is low vitamin D. Mine was very low and when started taking vitamin D energy levels far better. Also I have low thyroid too and taking thyroid medication at proper dosage greatly helped. Another thing I was low on is vitamin B12 which too corrected. So check these and correct may be your low energy can be improved easily.

If it makes you feel better maybe you could talk to a priest that specializes in exorcism. They are hard to find and I don’t know what it involves or what the rules are but maybe just the process will make you feel better. I have no doubt that you aren’t processed or have a demon, maybe it could be anger or rage that you feel growing inside of you! Hopefully meds will work!"
176035931,"Yes I get intrusive/obsessive thoughts…in some ways it is as bad as every other mental health issue…Its part of OCD, I also wonder if part of mania."
176035932,I get sad when people think I’m just attention seeking because I wouldn’t fail a grade for attention I wish I was already in high school and didn’t have this paranoia and other problems… Also that I wasnt in this foster home

176035935,"It hasn’t been horrible all week, I would say 2 or 3 days out of the week were days where I thought I was better off dead, well at least part of me thought that. The other days I felt like I was at least useful for some things if not exactly special feeling, overall it was just an ok week, my ‘blessing’ (which is more of a curse) is that my memory isn’t the best and I forget about how bad things were pretty quick, IF they get better. If things stay bad then it’s hard. In other news my prolactin levels are up, I have to see an endocrinologist about them which I am a little nervous about. How are you doing _AT_MENTION_ ?"

176035943,That’s understandable for sure _AT_MENTION_ is it a culture thing that people can’t accept your illness? I’m sorry that your heart is broken. You are not stupid.

176035949,"I’d love to have a relationship and I love my sanity. But if I had to choose between them I would pick sanity. And meds keep me sane. I had more than my share of insanity for years. I don’t want to go back to that. It’s tough when .loved ones don’t understand about the importance of medication. I never went through it with my family, they understood. But I’ve seen other people go through it with their families or significant others. It’s actually very tragic and sad."

174350923,"I wanted to explain to people why my pictures aren’t perfect and why I don’t do full face shots. I also thought it would be good to get my sza diagnosis out there. What do y’all think? Hi Everyone! My name is Heather, and I am a happily married mother with three children, one dog, and two guinea pigs. While I do stay busy, I like to spend my free time on makeup: shopping, looking, and trying. I also subscribe to a couple of beauty boxes so I can have even more things to try out. I also happen to have schizoaffective disorder. It’s kind of like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder having a baby; I have symptoms of both. Don’t worry- it’s well controlled with medication. Unfortunately, though, that very medication turned on me and gave me a condition called tardive dyskinesia that makes me blink, move my mouth, clasp my hands, and rock my head back and forth. It’s hard to get pictures as a result, so don’t expect to see full face shots. I’ll do what I can, though, but I ask that you b

174350929,I visited my brother and his wife and their kids. I was dreading it as I thought more people would be there. But thankfully there wasn’t. Something was different though. The only thing that’s changed is I’m taking abilify at 6pm instead of when I wake up now. But here’s the bizzare thing. Everything went normally. I was making conversation and joining in conversation. And it all felt natural. And I didn’t feel exhausted after it.

For example (just examples, it’s different for different cars) oil change at 3000 miles, tires rotated\ at 4000 miles, transmission inspected at 8000 miles etc. If you don’t have the manual you might try Amazon.com or the dealership or downloading it off the internet. Have the car inspected regularly by a trusted mechanic. And of course an obvious tip is that it is usually more expensive to get repairs done at the dealership so take it to a good mechanic for repairs."

176036004,"I was told that was a reason to stop the supplements. My family all have a blood disorder that makes us unable to absorb iron properly, and we have taken iron supplements before when we had a doctor who was not well versed in our disorder. The problem with our type of anemia is that we still get the proper amount of iron in our blood, but it does not absorb into the red blood cells so it just floats freely in our system. This means we are more likely to die of iron toxicity if we take supplements, since the iron doesn’t go anywhere."

Now I started a keto diet and eat just over 1500 calories a day and the weight is dropping off me. Probably too fast in fact! I lost 2kg in 6 days!

174350937,I had problems with Abilify and Vraylar. Both of these drugs made me extremely anxious. Vraylar made me manic and nuts! I was involuntarily committed to a psych hospital twice soon after taking Vraylar. No more partial dopamine agonists for me. No way.
176036021,"I believe that compassion has two components: helping someone less fortunate than yourself having no desire and expectation of return A few years ago my girlfriend was driving me to the store when I saw a lady standing next to a _NAME_ on the shoulder with a flat tire. I asked my girlfriend to pull over so I can help (I know how to change a tire). I changed the tire and went back to my car. I didn’t change her tire with the expectation of receiving money; I wasn’t motivated by a quid pro quo (this for that). I just wanted to help. I was in the supermarket recently. There was a man riding an electric scooter. He was reaching for a can and dropped it. I picked up the can and gave it to him. I didn’t ask him for money; I didn’t tell him that “he owes me.” Again, no quid pro quo. I just wanted to help."

174350948,"I wouldn’t either, does your pdoc hospitalize you if your seeing things? Just say you have your husband as a support and he can oversee your med change, be sure to do your research on potent antipsychotics. There’s literature online, you can help your pdoc out by having an idea of what you want to go on. For example after a couple months of being off haldol, I switched to fluphenazine on a very low dose and I turned really manic, couldn’t sleep. I tried navane, Seroquel, and then haldol all within like a week. The haldol was the most potent, too potent my energy was effected by it, and I was sitting in class and kept hearing calculators click and closed my eyes and actually saw the calculator and then numbers that were being punched in. I had to leave early. It’s scary being on something so sedating but there is a chemistry on what dopamine receptors they effect and abilify is more serotonin. I wish you luck on finding a better AP, and remember it is possible to get a med change not in the 
hospital!"
174350953,Do you experience negative symptoms?
176036066,So basically I’m sleeping too much on 50 mg of Loxapine I take it with Geodon. My symptoms are just okay managed. Could be managed better. I want to switch back to Vraylar as I was on it two years ago with success but I have no idea if my insurance will cover it. I’m just sick and tired of being tired all the time. Which meds don’t make you tired? I can’t tolerate Abilify so that’s out of the question.

176036072,Why do I need a behavioral therapist
176036073,I’ve started to believe in predestination. Things were not gonna have happened any other way anyways. It just is. Makes me feel better
176036074,I spend all day by myself and then in the evenings my sister is home but she just watches tv and plays on her laptop. So I feel pretty isolated actually. I’m going to start therapy soon and a new life skills program and then I’ll feel less isolated. It’s a blessing really. I can’t wait.

And are there side effects I know everyone is different and reacts differently I just was wondering that’s all. I read that weight gain isn’t a side effect of Buspar God I hope that isn’t one for me I cant afford to gain anymore weight if I lose on Buspar that would be really nice but I read where weight loss or gain was not a side effect its weight neutral from what I read.

Diet pills don’t mix well when you are on psych meds it could interact with them and give dangerous side effects I know from experience from trying Garcinia Cambodia diet pills and had severe chest pain that would not leave until I stopped taking them. I hate taking pills any kind of pills except my meds I take make me sick to my stomach and make me gag. I cant always have what I want I never wanted this illness but I have it so I deal with it that best way I know how, and if I have to take pills for the rest of my life so be it I don’t like this one bit but I cant change it must accept it and go on.

174350991,It affects how you deal with others. Positive symptoms like ideas or reference and magical thinking put layers on conversations and interactions that others don’t experience. That is the issue. Most people just brush it off and move on. People with sz can often be obsessive about it all.

174350997,"Condepency is a relationship issue mostly but it doesn’t have to be a romantic one. Solving people’s problems is part of it. Basically, it’s not drawing a clear enough line between “you” and “me.” So you over extend and get wrapped up in other people."
176036243,"I feel the same way, in that no matter what I do they ridicule and harass me in a variety of ways. I have to walk on eggshells for my actions, thoughts, and words (because of the entities), so I agree that the feeling of never winning with them is something I experience constantly. I hope you can find relief someway"

176036245,A coworker of mine had psychosis after using Chantix. I don’t know how long his episode lasted.
176036246,I can ‘fake’ being pretty normal and it’s hard to tell. I’ve always used speaking and conscious of it’s ins and outs. It gets me through life but I still struggle in some areas. I’m like you. Started reading _NAME_ books to get into it and slowly getting back into it. I still watch few movies and hopefully one day I can enjoy them again. You gain some and lose some with sz no matter how high functioning or stable you are.

The diagnosis was not far fetched. I think you have an _NAME_ obsession of “being in the world” - and not a typical psychosis. But does it matter that much? I guess it all ends up in whether you benefit or not from medication and only you and the people who follow you daily can tell that. Hope you are allright?"

174350999,I have the meanest people talking to me. But I don’t want to die. They make me sound really bad or at least I think so. They call me all these names. They think I say all these terrible things. I just want to be left alone. And they make such a big deal over what is being said. Even though I am not saying these things. I feel I am having bad luck because I have people actively doing things to me. I usually have better luck. Should I just go out especially if I feel unsafe.

If you’re a patient under the supposed care of a mental health trust sees you as a malcontent ,and in doing so turns a blind eye to things that affect you, then the chances of an optimal recovery are going to be rather slim . From what I can tell the attitude of mental health professionals towards those of us later found to be on the spectrum is often rather crap, and not one that’s geared to the patient doing as well as possible."

But itll be scary if my quality of life doesn’t get better even on benzos… believe me, I fight every day now, since an year, which is new for me, but I crash still every day, mainly in the evenings I guess where I am very desperate about my future and where my body betrays me I know many people are on benzos too… but I took my klonopin once in 4 days since 5 years tbh… but I cant handle anymore the pain, I should not suffer like this, so maybe I’ll start benzos every day… to be on them a whole life, is it possible?

174351012,"I too often feel extensive _NAME_ from what I consider long forgotten dreams. burntbythesun very accurately described the feelings that I too share regarding the _NAME_. I am not sure what _PERSON_ described as their issue. My own delusions are mostly flavoured either “memories from past lives” or “conversations with souls of personalities from my past lives”. Are your experiences similar, _PERSON_? If so, I hope my message helps you combat your problem. Personally, I managed to reduce and subdue my delusions when I realised that my “memories” are fueled not by unknown unverifiable source, as I thought from the start. Rather, my delusions are produced as a reaction to real life experiences from childhood and young adulthood. Basically, what japanese cartoons I watched, what games played, what books read, encounters with other people in school or college or vacations, and more importantly personal insecurities. For years I considered my delusions as problems that the unseen force imposes 
on me unfairly. In reality however it was my own fantasies and vulnerabilities that due to peculiarities of schizophrenia I could not distinguish from reality. Eventually I made an incomplete list of my most persistent are reoccurring delusions. Then, I found an explanation for the true source of this delusion from my real life and not “past lives”. It is a very simple grounding exercise that I recommend you attempt, if, like me, you have “memories” and “prophecies” flung at you."

174351011,"A working theory for what causes schizophrenia is that the blood brain barrier is weak, allowing an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species into the brain, which becomes oxidative stress and inflammation. The inflammation causes a chemical imbalance, and that then causes schizophrenia symptoms, positive and negative. What causes a leaky blood-brain barrier to begin with is sometimes drug-related, sometimes dietary, and sometimes stress-related (usually a mixture of two or all three.) I will step you through the science of it! The following is a brief explanations with linked studies. (Source: Adobe Stock) Section 1: A theory for schizophrenia This suggests that a hyper-permeable (weak) blood-brain barrier contributes to schizophrenia: “Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction and Blood-Brain Barrier Hyperpermeability Contribute to Schizophrenia Neurobiology: A Theoretical Integration of Clinical and Experimental Evidence.” Study at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A weak blood-brain barrier contributes t

the blood-brain and small intestinal epithelial barriers (Wheat increases zonulin levels)” From the study at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Wheat bread and other grains raise BBB permeability (Source: Adobe Stock) The following shows that a high-fat, standard (western) diet increases blood-brain barrier permeability (A western diet was one with 42% calories from fat, and 34% from sugar:) “Reduced cognitive function, increased blood-brain-barrier transport (weakened blood-brain barrier) and inflammatory responses, and altered brain metabolites in LDLr -/- and C57BL/6 mice fed a western diet” From the study at https://journals.plos.org The standard Western diet raises BBB permeability (Source: Adobe Stock) The following shows that high saturated fat diets raise intestinal permability: “Effects of dietary fat profile on gut permeability and microbiota and their relationships with metabolic changes in mice.” “HFD-sat (High saturated fat diet) increased index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), colonic perm
eability (intestinal lining weakening), and mesenteric fat inflammation.” From the study at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov High saturated fat diets raise BBB permeability (Source: Adobe Stock) The following seems to conclude that there is a link between intestinal permeability (“leaky gut”) and blood-brain barrier permeability (“leaky brain”) “Leaky Gut, Leaky Brain?” “The gut certainly can influence the blood brain barrier through gastro-intestinal-derived hormonal secretion, allowing some drugs, amino acids, and small molecules to permeate barrier systems and even influence cytokine production, which is one inflammatory piece of the innate immune system issue.” From the conclusion of https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov There is evidence connecting gut health to brain health (Source: Adobe Stock) Aspartame seems to increase BBB permeability as well ""Aspartame also compromises the blood–brain barrier, increasing its permeability and altering concentrations of catecholamines, such as dopamine, in t

Another time during my addiction I lent my car to someone I didn’t know. He had dropped me off at someone’s house I did not know. I did not know the area at all and I didn’t know where I was. People were coming and going and the only person I knew there was my connection. People were smoking crack and they smoked a little with me but then they did not want to share. I begged and annoyed them for a few hits until they got mad and threatened me and kicked me out of the bedroom. I went to the living room by myself while they all smoked crack in the bedroom. After several hours I kept asking my connection when my car was coming back because he knew the guy driving it. He kept putting me off and t
elling me not to worry but finally at around midnight he asked me, “Don’t you get it? He ain’t coming back.” It made my feel both mentally and physically ill because it was my dads car. It was just such a weird f*cked up situation which was about par for the course during my addiction. I stayed in that house all night and slept on the couch for a couple of hours and then got up early and took a walk to a store. I felt a bad episode coming on because I was in a relapse and it was happening all the time at that period. The house had no phone so I walked across the street to their neighbor and knocked on the door to see if I could use their phone. The people answered but none of them spoke English except one person. I explained that I needed to call the cops. They actually let me use the phone and the cops came and took me to the hospital. Now that I’m clean and sober, my life back then compared to now is like day and night. Back in my drug days situations like that night in the house and even worse si
tuations were just a common occurrence for four years. Now, nothing remotely like that situation has happened to me in the last 28 years clean. Anyways, the last time I called the cops to take me to a ward was about 1988 and they took me but they said they don’t normally do that and told me not to call them again. Snobs. Babies. Spoilsports."
176036330,"I actually have not ever had voices. I just had delusions due to working at a large pharma company and the environment I worked in. I had done a bit too much reading on the internet about cell towers and radiation amongst many other things that had me thinking I was a “vested interest” of the company. This was however just me in psychosis basing my reality on loose associations of things. I thought my lightbulbs were giving off EM radiation because they had neodymium coatings, I thought my neighbor was doing something secret with his radio antennas, it was a bunch of stuff. I even thought the meds they were giving me were for my transformation into an alien human hybrid(Invega was interpreted as “in Vega” which _PERSON_ is a star ha). I would like to hear your experiences as they sound as if they could be somewhat similar, I never had voices but I had crazy crazy delusions."

176036339,"Yes, it’s usual at the Recovery meetings to ask for a non obligituary nominal donation. They pride themselves on being an independent organisation free from influence by other organisations so they suggest 5 euro or so per meeting to keep the system running. I’ve seen people come regularly who couldn’t afford to give any donation at all and they were treated just the same as everyone else. It’s all above board and there’s never any pressure on anyone at all unless they’re being excessively disruptive due to their illness."
174351026,"In psychology courses they showed us studies about how the parietal lobe shrinks and dysfunction in SZ with MRIs. The parietal lobe is responsible for integrating and processing our senses so it makes sense that this causes the positive symptoms. In advanced SZ like my case, the shrinking also affects the frontal lobe affecting executive function. That explains the negative and cognitive symptoms that some SZs have. P.S I took psychology and neuroscience classes in university."

Not that you should become as arrogant as I did but upon recovery I discovered a large portion of my anxiety was from living half of a life constantly seeking approval from a mostly selfish society. I grew jaded realizing that I had allowed myself to be a doormat easy for others to use, deceive and exploit.

174351050,"Well, we don’t know which of its various actions is potentially useful or if several of them in combination are. It does seem to interact with D2, possibly more directly than KarXt. NaBen and Evenamide as far as I know, do not. However, it’s always possible that some part of their functionality is because of downstream modulation of dopamine. It’s not quite so simple as dopamine blockers causing negative symptoms since unmedicated people also have them, but obviously the current ones have serious side effects that hopefully these new ones won’t. If their action is indirect, that may help with a lot of the side effects. If you overproduce dopamine in the wrong area of the brain (and underproduce it in others) something that works upstream to prevent the overproduction vs just blocking it might be better."

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

It ain’t my fault, they shouldn’t have made me invisible in high school. It’s quite a revelation to discover I have an affect on people and they can actually see me and wonder what I’m thinking."

If someone did that, life on this planet would improve drastically. Every billionaire needs to feel massive guilt all the time IMHO. Just give the money away to people who need it, nobody needs that much money, I don’t care if they earned it or not. Nobody becomes that rich without a large amount of luck in addition to other factors.

176036469,"Do we actually have an internal body or is it all in our imagination? Does thinking about the workings of our internal body make us and others sick? Is it better to simply ignore the internal body and assume that everything is ok? These questions arise when I consider learning about medicine. There is infinite life in existence in infinite states, we are only ever aware of a finite amount of it, perpetually in flux. Being a medic involves involving ourselves in the lives of sick people of which there are an infinite amount. There are also an infinite amount of people who aren’t sick. Of course, as I said, we are only ever aware of finitely many people at a time, but at present, the balance in my life is in favour of the well. Would studying medicine change that? Deliberately seeking out negativity in order to correct it is a purpose for some, perhaps it is the only purpose? We take on as much as we can handle or is prescribed to us. At present, I seem to be drawn to medicine, having found that I 
could not handle well the negativity of war and politics. Yet every now and then, I wonder if it is the right path. There is always negativity, always things that can be improved upon, always change. I am enjoying studying medicinal theories and practicing shiatsu when I can, perhaps I shouldn’t question the wisdom of this. Thank you."

I am trying to maintain sanity but this past week has been horrible I find myself losing grasp of sanity; and I found an old prescription bottle full of 40mgs Strattera so thinking it would help my depression i took a lot of it–and made myself even worse.

174351068,Drugs.com Clozapine Reviews & Ratings at Drugs.com Reviews and ratings for clozapine. 45 reviews submitted with a 7.1 average score. For Schizophrenia: “In 2012 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia after hearing voices talking to me day and night and couldn’t sleep. I went on invega and then Risperidone but they both made me feel like a zombie because I had to be on the highest dose. I had akathisia and I was restless and tired at the same time and just wanted to sleep all day but physically couldn’t and very depressed. I would hear voices every night when it would wear off. I had intrusive thoughts also. My doctor suggested trying 250mg Clozapine but I was scared. It is a miracle drug! The outside voices went away and the thoughts that weren’t my own! I have no side effects and I am happier now! After a year you only have to get your blood drawn once a month. Worth it to have my life back!” 10/10

174351079,"I’ve been wondering about my diagnosis lately. Wondering if it’s accurate. Yes I have psychosis and mood symptoms. But the interesting thing is I first got the start of my psychotic symptoms less than a year after a sexual abuse incident when I was 12. The symptoms started mild and didn’t get worse till I was around 19, so I don’t know? I want to bring this up with my psychiatrist and therapist and see what they say. So what do you all know? Can childhood trauma or sexual abuse cause psychosis? And if so then it wouldn’t be true schizophrenia right?"
174351074,"As I said before in another thread drinking coffee too much especially unfiltered coffee raises blood cholesterol levels as it have a substance which affect body’s ability to get rid of cholesterol and also high caffeine dose itself can cause arrhythmia issues. Smoking, vaping etc also brings similar risk and also these increase chance of anxiety, paranoia etc as it touches adrenaline, norepinephrine part which again effects heart function. I know you love these substances so find reasons to keep taking it like saying everyday people drink coffee, smoke etc and no problem but the fact is those not everyone get effected by it equally those who have heart issues taking medicines for high cholesterol etc are heavily effected thats why cardiologist tell patients to restrict or stop it fully. Its true that AP medicines raise weight but you can do several to reduce weight like controlling diet, regular exercise etc. Now you might say for that have no motivation due to negative symptoms. For this you ne
ed to ask yourself did I doing anything which reduces daily motivation other than schizo and schizo medicines itself? Anything which gives temporary pleasure will significantly cause lack of motivation for harder things in life and this is especially true if already have negative symptoms. Converse also true if do harder things then less harder ones like daily activities get easy. Harder ones include solving puzzles, workout, house cleaning, cooking and many other things which requires mental and physical effort."
176036563,"I talked it over with my mum. A bit, cause she got upset and couldnt deal with it. She does not want to reconnect. He is not welcome at her funeral. She says she isnt angry though, she just doesnt want him there, but will write a letter. I will let it be, cause there clearly isnt room for it for her. Today many hurtful things came up in my mind. Things others have done. Things i have done, even more so. Im in emotional pain. Im sad - my response to the traumatic things and the horribly bad choices i made for my life after, hurt my family so badly. My parents are traumatised because of my psychotic behaviour and other actions. I still feel i made my mum terminally ill via causing her stress. I cant really live with myself. I feel like a psychopath, hurting everyone around me. I think it would be better if i died instead (wont commit suïcide, but i wish we could trade). To be honest…I feel like what i have done is much much much worse than what my uncle did. :-/"
174351082,"Then it sounds like you need to be on meds. Negative symptoms are hard to overcome, But not impossible. You have to force yourself to do stuff. I do, all the time. I have negative symptoms, but I get dressed and put on makeup everyday, take showers, take care of my falling apart mother in law and run the entire household. It’s not fun, I don’t enjoy it, but I do it because I have to. I feel like if you pushed yourself more, you’d be able to do more things. You’ve kind of resigned yourself to the idea that you can’t do a lot and that’s a bad attitude to have."

Can’t run around like an ass hole all the time. And then when I’m having symptoms I withdraw from my family as well because it hurts to be with anybody. Either I’m letting them down or they are letting me down. That’s how that works in my sick brain."

I predict with the technology we’ve created and currently use will alter our dynamic physically and emotionally. Too bad we won’t be around to see the future results."

176036577,"Hey, I’m reading a book right now on social anxiety/shyness/rejection! The author has strategies to overcome the underlying belief of not being worthy of love, and therefore fearing rejection because rejection reinforces the belief that one is somehow flawed. So far they involve being able to disagree with others, believing you are strong enough to accept rejection and realizing your own value. Interesting stuff. He does mention that everyone is socially anxious to some degree, it just varies in the degrees."

Although, at work I heard to the word _PERSON_ being used to insult someone in a bad way behind their back, and that bothered me big time. Lesson in context"
176036596,Yes but explaining them to the psychologist I said they were delusions because it felt like 10 years ago… but she said not to call them delusions as they sound like fantasy or some sort of dissociation cos I was aware of what was happening

176036627,I have OCD now that I’m taking meds I didn’t before sz they come as intrusive thoughts
176036628,Yes you can rewire your brain. Consider you developed a habit of waking from night time sleep at a fixed time say 8 AM. Your mind automatically wakes you up in this time everyday. On the other hand consider you slept more than 8 AM for some days then your mind no longer wakes you up at 8 AM. Here you rewired your brain to wake up 8 AM at first then disrupted that.
176036629,When I had voices medication did not help or the only one that did was a sleeping tablet immovane. When I was delusional it took away my delusions but I never believed they were delusions I thought it was real but I think this forum helped me realise they were delusions.

176036634,The best way to get rid of a habit you don’t like is to replace it with a habit you do like. The best way to swap out habits is to concentrate on replacing them one at a time.
174351093,"I agree. Even my terrifying delusions and hallucinations had this energy about them that felt good. Like, I wanted to write a letter and I just could. No struggle. I had the energy to do things. Not like too much energy. Just a normal amount. Like I had as good night’s sleep even it was full of nightmares. I don’t know. I don’t have mania either. I really thought I did for as long time because I didn’t want to accept that I had sz, but every doctor I’ve seen always says I have sz and not sza or bipolar. I’ve argued that I was manic because I wasn’t sleeping well and still had energy to do all these things and they said that’s just what normal people feel like without negative symptoms and without the sedating effect of the meds. ? But yeah, I sometimes miss that energy. I don’t miss the scary stuff and thinking I need to kill myself or kill someone else, but that energy. Mmmmm. Yeah. Miss that."
176036635,"After (partial) medication withdrawal or change, how long does it usually take to find a new balance? To be done with withdrawals and rebound psychosis and feelings coming back and cognitive skills changing and neurotransmitters and receptors finding a new balance, and all that? I know there is irreversible stuff…of my own and medication induced. Symptoms might just return. But im quite interested in the temporary things. When can i safely say “this is the brain im stuck with from now on? It wont get better than this”. Is that a week, a month, a year, a decade? What research is there on this subject?"

When I am physically ill and in lots of pain due to my MD, it destroys my mental health. My health has been declining lately. It’s not helping me much in terms of maintaining my mental health. So when my physical health is bad, my mental health is bad. The downside of having a degenerative disease is that you are going to be super depressed when you are sick…"

176036650,Yes you should press the issue with the doctor. I always ask my psychiatrist if I have a certain illness and I always ask him if I can take medication for it. It is up to the psychiatrist to decide ultimately but self reporting in psychiatry is how the psychiatrist can accurately treat you.

She said doctors are shielding the public about just how brutal this will become to avoid widespread panic among the masses. Heard it here first, folks.

176036660,"This might be triggering so be cautious. What always helped me was to accept death, our death is inevitable and we have to see that as a fact. Instead of delaying something for later, when that time comes, your anxiety will still be young and vibrant, you want it to die down by living everyday as if you won’t be here tomorrow. Remember you are mortal. Death is a friend that we need to come to accept it is there to guide us, not to be our enemy. I hope this helps."

I have enough real life drama at home. I don’t need it in the workplace as well. If push comes to shove, I’ll just tell both of them to get bent and be done with it."

176036675,"a few years into my experience with the mental health field,these days its mostly to determine if meds are working and I have enough refills for my next appointment. Pdoc will ask if there is anything else I want to talk about and then they say ‘see you in X months’ My first few years as a patient were very frustrating while I got accustomed to getting a new doc every so often and getting put on different meds and having stuff switched around.

176036750,"That is because they see a lot of us having taken drugs that they believe precipitated sz. The jury is still out on that one, but if it came to light that trauma and genetics were the main reason sz occurs; and that drug taking is as a result of childhood trauma was the main reason people who go on to develop sz took drugs it might educate them. At the moment it seems that the drug rhetoric allows for blaming the victim, rather than themselves with bad parenting/supervision or their own genetics. For example, there is a link between having sz and coeliac disease and it is not widely known by szs or by the parents. How many of us have had a 23andme test to find out they carry one of the two coeliac genes and run a higher risk of having and developing coeliac disease?"

It’s not fair because I barely gained any weight on invega something like 25 pounds but now my face looks super bloated and I don’t look the same :(. If your on Abilify do you look the same as before you went on Abilify…? And if you made the switch to Abilify did you notice if it became unbloated

I’ve witnessed entities beyond my current abilities in that form. Most nights I dream I have symptoms the next morning, but that could be because I don’t sleep well and it stresses me.

174351143,Hello! So Ive been suffering from schizophrenia since I was 15. Im now 24 years old. Back when I was 15 and I started first getting ill my mental health was really bad. What I mean is I was scared all the time from different impossible things for example “they will read my thoughts” and I was believing something may happen to me. I also had really vivid imagination and I found myself dreaming different things almost all the time. I’ve never had hallucinations and I’ve never heard voices. My question is: Do you think this was a psychotic episode? It continued for 3-4 months.

Don’t fall into the trap of longing for an idealised world. Sometimes you need to just let go your pain and get into a better headspace. I know how you feel. I have had 1 relationship in my life of note that lasted a few months, and I am 32. I feel the same way you do too so I understand where you’re coming from. I have just accepted I will most likely not be in a position to be loved by a partner, and I no longer expect it to happen. Eventually you’ll be used to your own company, and will be able to beat being lonely and I have found you can actually be fine and enjoy yourself being single. I honestly do hope there is a chance for people like us to find someone, but if that doesn’t happen you still have got to continue to live and try to be kinder to yourself.

If you have 80 pears and 80 apples and we want to know how many sets of 10 there is of each then (10)(8 pears) and (10)(8 apples) So 8 groups of 10 pears and apples. Or with quadratics the factored form allows you to find the x intercepts of graph or the vertex depending on what form you put it in. That’s my newly completed precalculus educated guess lol That’s why we need computers to do calculations for us

My daughter said she will walk with me. My mental health worker got a number for me to call about volunteering at a new animal shelter that just opened up. May be a good fit. Not sure what would be expected of me.
176036936,Lack of sleep is always a good indicator for me. The brain being too busy and paranoia usually are my first symptoms.

176036943,I’ve felt like that in the past. Extremely glad I didn’t act on it. And actually I’m 59 years old and the closer I get to death the more I want to live.

She accepted that over time and now we have a good bond."

176036953,"I can agree with what you said. Life is meaningless and the more meaning we try to add in the grand scheme of things seems worthless, but if you think about the small details that build the bigger picture, every drop a paint in an artist painting has an objective and that is to be itself in its best way possible, and it ends up making a master piece. So we can derive from that analogy that everything matters and everything is part of something we don’t comprehend so maybe there is a ignorance factor in it, but living a life in such a concrete matter will only bring misery and pain. I hope this dread wears off _AT_MENTION_. I wish you the best and I hope my words can bring some form of comfort."

I consider myself reasonably intelligent but I’ve made lots of mistakes and bad choices. I’m talking about after I got clean. I’ve done a lot of things wrong, but like my sister used to tell me occasionally, I’m doing a lot of things right too. If I don’t do anything to make my neighbors kill me or injure me maybe in a couple of years I’ll be able to look back and laugh at this period in my life."
176036957,"I wish people would put a qualifier such as “Im trying to understand how you feel,” because the biggest issue with how we view empathy is our own ego making us think we actually know how someone else is feeling. I wouldn’t tell someone who went through something that I haven’t I know what it feels like. Even if we went through something similar, it effects us differently so I dont know what they’re feeling. All things being equal, I think its a very human thing to compare someone else’s situation with our own even if they aren’t a good comparison. I feel a lot better when someone is trying to be empathetic, and when I do get upset I remember that they are trying, and its a heck of a lot better than being disregarded. The thing that pisses me off the most is when people try to tell me what _PERSON_ experiencing. Someone tried to tell me that my hallucinations are really my inner consciousness guiding me, and I’ve had people tell me I didn’t hallucinate something. Ive told everyone 
in my life to not second guess what I say is a hallucination, because then I start questioning my reality more."

They kept taking blood, I queried them on it, and the guy responded by saying “Don’t worry we’re not going to empty out your life”. Really strange thing to say. What’s the alien delusion like in thoughts or feelings. A loved one of mine had sexual dysfunction once and said he felt like an alien. I feel alienated, socially. _NAME_ Nash believed his answers to math were being sent to him by extra terrestrials.

176037005,Bad stuff happens to good people. Bad stuff happens to bad people. Good stuff happens to good people. Good stuff happens to bad people. That’s the way it has always been. There’s all manners of degree of suffering. Look at wars. Billions of people have died in wars. Every one of them had a story. But a majority who have died are young people who never got a chance to live a long time on earth. How is that fair? Screw suffering. I could have done without it. How did it help me? I was a nice enough person before I got schizophrenia and suffered 8 months in a hospital.
176037006,I hope I’m like that at work. Where I make friends and make people laugh. Your lucky that happens and it’s not different
174351183,Catatonia is a separate condition from schizo and treatment also separate. Dopamine blockers used for schizo worsens catatonia. Exceptions there like abilify which is also a partial dopamine agonist. Also clozapine is different from usual APs and it have some benefit for relieving catatonia.
176037007,I think it’s schizophrenia but I don’t know what to do about it except suggest medication.

If someone was neither sensitive or lacking much insight but just had crazy ass psychotic delusions then the therapist might say “you’re delusional”. Me doctor or therapist never told me that. I was lacking insight for about 15 years I’d say , was probably the worst part of my mind. It was somewhere else. For many years my mind had great coping mechanisms of denial as well.

176037043,Look at it this way. When a company presents a commercial they claim that they are a lot of wonderful things that they can never live up to in order to get your business. When you present yourself to them you probably better be the same way. I know it’s lying but it’s how we are. We trust people more when they say they are great. So other people are the same way.

176037070,"Therapy has helped me a lot, along side medication. I’ve found that therapy is particularly good to help with paranoia and delusions. You just have to go there with the right attitude to get better."
176037071,"Yes. I believe they should institute scoop laws and forced medication for homeless. Get them treated and back into society. They way they live is not living at all. It’s cruel. For your standard SZ, if you fail reality testing you should be on a treatment order with forced meds."
176037072,"I agree. I don’t understand philosophy. I watched some anti-philosophy videos from modern physicists I admire like _NAME_ and I guess it just stuck. The thing with philosophy is it doesn’t lead to new progress anymore like the old days. I mean we got Simulation Theory, but that paper was from _NAME_. I guess he is a philosopher but he does other things too. We have physicists who are proving that stuff and trying to prove that stuff and engineers who are making that stuff become a reality. I’d hate for you to get stuck in some philosophical prison like I did with the DP/DR but I guess it has to take it’s course. I guess philosophers make the initial leap but physicists and engineers come up with the proof, I guess I’m saying."

I tried to get away with it as long as possible, until they recieved medical reports from previous doc. After they got the reports, they all claimed i did indeed have the bug…kind of crushing really…i tell no one. My secret and my comfortable prison inside my mind…"

I’m really nervous about leaving the house. and everyone has cut me off because of how I was in acute psychosis. I’m quitting vyvanse right now too because I read a review or study on the dopamine delema of how giving psychotic patients ADHD meds will over time make the underlying condition worse. quitting vyvanse has been known to cause acute psychosis for up to a month in 60% of patients, longer in other minorities… i had to sleep 16 hours today and was having horrible nightmares and a bit of voices while trying to wake myself up. didn’t last more than a few minutes for each time I was hearing stuff. still, I’m horribly depressed and ashamed but also scared and feel very isolated."

I noticed lately I was getting more paranoid and sick and stuff and I saw a star-fished shape ufo/drone in the neighborhood among other things. Could be aliens or something, I don’t know.

174351209,"You definitely have schizophrenia. The things you are afraid of make zero sense to most people. You need to keep seeking treatment and tweaking your medicine until these beliefs go away. If a medicine you’re taking isn’t working, or is giving you side effects, tell the psychiatrist. Refuse to accept anything but improvement. Find someone in your family to fight for you if you can’t fight for yourself. Find another psychiatrist if the one you have is lousy. You need to find the right dose of the right antipsychotic so these delusions go away. The unsafe feeling should go away with them."

Vitamin B-12 and other B vitamins play a role in producing brain chemicals that affect mood and other brain functions. Low levels of B-12 and other B vitamins such as vitamin B-6 and folate may be linked to depression. Various B-vitamins are important foundations of producing good brain chemicals.

For dinner I eat another veggie plus a plain baked potato or brown rice and chicken breast or salmon a lot. I limit red meat to one or two days a week. I eat a protein bar on days I workout. Everything I eat is extremely healthy. I don’t eat mayonnaise anymore I don’t eat cheeseburgers no fries no chips and the bread I eat with my sandwiches is whole grain seeded bread. I eat a bunch of fiber protien and healthy fats with this diet. I don’t eat unhealthy carbs. I have a bowl of oatmeal with breakfast a lot too. I don’t eat bacon either. But one of the reasons I’m losing weight is I used to drink at least 4 rockstar energy drinks everyday and a 6 pack of beer like 4 days a week. I ate r
ed meat all the time and never ate fruit or veggies. I was eating horrible for a couple of years. Haldol is not for everyone but it is known as a weight neutral drug. I am eating strictly healthy things and exercising everyday. My advice would be to eat fruit and veggies and a lot of chicken and a lot of salmon.

I was absolutely terrified of how dark my thoughts would get though. It made me feel sick and scared. Thoughts that would tell me to hurt and kill. But I didnt want to. I never wanted anyone hurt. I was so scared of myself. But I was able to have restraint. I worked on my temper I stopped threatening people. I stopped scratching people. And eventually through time my thoughts got better.

174351252,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Evaluating the Impact of Nonrandom Mating: Psychiatric Outcomes Among the Offspring of Pairs Diagnosed With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. AE _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Biological psychiatry , Jul 2019 09 Nonrandom mating has been shown for psychiatric diagnoses, with hypothesized-but not quantified-implications for offspring liability. This national cohort study enumerated the incidence of major psychiatric disorders among the offspring of parent pairs affected with schizophrenia (SCZ) and/or bipolar disorder (BIP) (i.e., dual-affected pairs).Participants were all Swedish residents alive or born between 1968 and 2013 (n = 4,255,196 unique pairs and 8,343,951 offspring). Offspring with dual-affected, single-affected, and unaffected parents were followed (1973-2013) for incidence of broad psychiatric disorders. Primary outcomes included hazard ratio (HR) and cumulative incidence for SCZ and BIP in the offspring. Additional o
utcomes included any neuropsychiatric, anxiety, depressive, personality, or substance use disorders. Cumulative incidences of SCZ and BIP were used to inform heritability models for these disorders.Hazards were highest within disorder (e.g., offspring of dual-SCZ pairs had sharply raised hazards for SCZ [HR = 55.3]); however, they were significantly raised for all diagnoses (HR range = 2.89-11.84). Incidences were significantly higher for the majority of outcomes, with 43.4% to 48.5% diagnosed with ""any"" disorder over follow-up. Risks were retained, with modest attenuations, for the offspring of heterotypic pairs. The estimated heritability of liability for SCZ (h2 = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.70) and BIP (h2 = 0.52, 95% confidence interval = 0.46-0.58) did not differ significantly from estimates derived from single-affected parents.Risks for a broad spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses are significantly raised in the offspring of dual-affected parents, in line with expectations from a polygenic mo
del of liability to disease risk. How these risks may contribute to population maintenance of these disorders is considered."

I was at 10 mg and started having symptoms and he wanted to raise it to 20, but I complained. I ended up in the hospital. After the hospitalization I got a new doctor and for two years he has kept me at 20 mg per day. I have felt sedated, but the doctor seems to think I need the 20 mg.

174351262,"Thanks for answering, everytime I spoke about hypersexuality here users ridiculized me saying I need to control myself and its not the Abilify. No one believed me even after I posted proof from FDA and Health Canada website. People just know about meds causing hyposexuality but not hypersexuality. I understand that its rare but its shouldn’t be ignored."

176037324,"I’m managing my illness fairly well, but due to my emotional and unstable CPTSD self, it’s sometimes hard to manage my condition- both physically and mentally. I’ve been having a low self-esteem for the past few weeks and it’s been hard."

174351267,"She saved me from suicide many times, brought me to the hospital when I was psychotic, put my meds in my food and drink when I refused them, told me that Abilify changed my personality for the worse (Addictions & Hypersexuality), helped me financially a LOT, put up with my violence verbal and physical, offered me a new pdr (her friend), told me how to convince my pdr to prescribe Vraylar, she gives me confidence in myself, taught me study tricks that boosted my grades, etc I could continue and write forever. I would be dead without her. I don’t know how to thank her. She just wants me to get better and she’s succeeding at it."
176037334,Yes m better thnks
176037335,Some delusions are persistent even with treatment. The important thing is you know it is not true. This is called insight. I have a persistent delusion that my son died at birth and that everyone just went along with the fact that he survived because they knew that I was not strong enough to handle his death. This delusion was fueled by the fact that he was born blue. But in reality they were able to revive him and he is a healthy 18 year old man now. You just have to keep reminding yourself of the reality of the situation and hold onto that insight.

176037346,Yeah I’m feeling like this is happening to me as well. Passive aggressive behavior on here. I really shouldnt give a s*** either. This illness has me feeling insecure as well. Some of their behavior may be due to not feeling well themselves. I think alot of people are struggling in here.

176037354,I really think in my case its genetic and that sz is highly genetic. I never had any environmental factors. I know twins who both developped sz at around the same age. I guess we can’t agree because sz causes are not 100% proven.

176037360,"Okay, so the first thing I saw when checking my email this morning was my bill from my technology service provider saying I owed way more than I thought I did. At first I thought “How crooked of them!” and simultaneously beat myself up for being so silly for having the new service installed. But then, my mind backtracked to how much I paid on my last bill, and then I added that amount to what I should owe this month, and that’s the amount showing on the bill. So, here’s hoping they made an honest mistake. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, anyway and I’ll call them in a few minutes to get it cleared up."

174351272,"Theres a lot of reasons why the average life span is lower for those with schizophrenia. Some studies include suicides and accidental deaths, which can drastically lower the average. Another big issue is the comorbidity of substance use including tobacco. The third issue is higher rates of obesity. Staying clean of substances and eating healthy with a dash of exercise will do wonders to lengthen your lifespan. With all that being said, not much you can do about accidental deaths, and I try not to worry about that too much."

176037375,Where do you live _AT_MENTION_ ?
176037377,I have had similar issues with the brain many years ago. It is possible that you have a chronic brain inflammation that inflates you brain and mounts pressure on the scull. You could try eating anti-inflammatory foods and supplements. That helped for me.
176037378,I am better with Risperdal since I make sure I don’t drink anything but ice water on hot days.
176037379,"If you quit your meds cold turkey you will probably be in a hospital bed a few weeks from now… Anti psychotic meds don’t work as regular meds, you end up worse if you quit them like you seem to want to. Even if you miss some of them for a short period you will end up worst. Ask your doc for his consent for doing so and hopefully he will find a way for you to do so without end up with even worse symptoms that you had before meds. It’s worst when people try to quit them without their consent, there’s a safe way to do it and it takes time… I’m not a doc, but from what I’ve seen in this forum, people that do those kind of choices end up being more treatment resistant compared with what they had before. Anyway, good luck and talk to your doc about it, it’s their job to help you"

Unfortunately its an ongoing process for as soon as i “get over” one thing, another pops up. My wife also helps with reality checks but that also only goes so far. That mixed with who i don’t mind having certain info or having the sinking feeling of inevitably, it has its ups and downs."
176037385,I agree with this 100%. People should learn coping skills and avoid threads that could trigger them if necessary.

174351277,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _PERSON_"
176037394,"Imagine that, as it is a human is made up of individual cells. Millions of them! Each cell is a single organism, yet we don’t know each one. These cells live individual lives and are part of us, the human individual. Each cell is unaware of the other, and like humans are unaware of other’s consciousness yet the cells make a whole human. Take a human, unaware of another to an extent and like the cells in a body is part of a whole; take it a step further the humans are cells making up a whole. A whole consciousness, all connected and interwoven making up the human universe. Each atom connects to another, whether human or not by touch creating a whole heaving, surging and swaying mass of universal consciousness.

176037401,"You are completely right. I won’t ignore it! I spent like three days feeling awfully suicidal and burdened by external stimuli/tactile hallucinations. I tried to stim more and embrace that identity of myself, which has worked well so far. I worry about my mom seeing this and thinking that I may not be normal. I wish I could hang out with others but I’m basically stuck at home because of the coronavirus outbreak infecting 4000+ people. So for now I’m going to make artworks and graphics and do lots of fun things, such as knitting. Your advice is so important to me. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with me."

How many years have you had schizophrenia? 10 years? 15 years? More? I wouldn’t base my life on a 20 minute incident. I wouldn’t base my life with schizophrenia on a 20 minute incident. I remember back in 1989. I was going through a hellish relapse. I was just in and out of psyche wards and really miserable. Every day was torture. One day I was laying on the lawn in the back yard and all of a sudden a peaceful feeling came over me. I felt good. I was unemployed at the time and I felt so good I walked 20 minutes to the strip mall and put in two job applications at the local supermarket and another store I can’t recall right now. I walked home. The next day I walked back to the grocery store to talk to the manager. I wasn’t as enthusiastic as the day before and I didn’t get the job and all my symptoms came right back. Life went on and my relapse didn’t get b
etter for a few more months. That feeling never happened again."

176037413,I was for quite a long time. I just wasn’t ready for a long-term relation. Mental health was too unstable. Then I felt ready enough I guess and ended up meeting someone off a dating site. She messaged me first. Been together for about 5 years. Some days I don’t feel capable of being in a relationship when my brain is being haywire. Thats when I feel better off single so I don’t affect someone else or I can just keep to myself. But I usually just tell her to give me space when I’m not doing well. So even though I thought I’d prob be single for ever I ended up in long-term relation land

I’ve been intimidated my whole life, I can take abuse, I can tough it out and accept my licks like anyone else, but the way they do it is inhuman. I’m starting to trust my instincts a little more and these people basically want to destroy me and not give me a chance. It’s not like they show occasional anger or that they are in the right or I am doing anything out of the ordinary, or that they can say to justify it by saying, “Well, this is how life works.” It’s just they found a sucker and they are acting uncool and don’t care how unfair, maddening, or how undignified or inhuman they are, they just want to milk me like a free gold mine or something that they can run over."

176037442,Awesome. Glad it went well.
176037443,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m really sorry to hear you feel that way. I’ve felt that at times in my life and it horrible feeling. One of the fears is that people would consider dying because there is not enough money, supports and resources and medical care so… people are unable to support themselves. In our society the solution should be more resources and supports, not assisted dying. *You are worthy of more supports, care and resources. More should be available to people with MI. I hope that becomes available for you.?"

My Dr doesn’t want to prescribe it again nor Rexulti as he said it has the same side effects as Abilify. I also read the same thing about Abilify/Rexulti on the FDA website, they both can cause addictions and hypersexuality."
176037451,"When I was refusing to take meds my thinking was turning to antipsychiatry. This was for a few reasons mainly the austere treatment those with mental illness receive, side effects of medications and most importantly they dont really understand mental illnesses especially sz. So thats why I ask is ‘schizophrenia’ schizophrenia because theres a detachment from the reality of what sz actually is. The word sz refers to divided mind because it was theorized there was a separation of mental functions but that theory has been debunked. It occurs to me those with sz often lose the critical thought tools for questioning their delusions so it can be said they lose the right way of thinking about or interpreting reality. At least as an analogy the same thing has happened with understanding sz and at times the profession has been a danger to others and themselves at least to taking away their credibility. My thinking is less antipsychiatric now that i have been successfully treated but im not without criti
cisms still."

176037460,"It went well . I’m doing much better than I was in Essex. That shows how important a combination of medication and social support can be . It was agreed that the depot is playing a part in keeping me as well as I am , and to stop it would not be a good idea . As I get older there might be a need to reduce the dose ,but that is par for the course when it comes to medication ."

176037468,I just tried to help him. Mental illness is a serious disease I know it as I myself experience symptoms for more than 30 years but as we know some live with it and some can’t face it and suicides. Same illness but some choose to live with it and some find it an excuse to die. And what advice one need to give to those who not want to face life? I think the best is to ask this question. Is there any person who live with this mental disease or something even worse? Answer is always a yes and we should also need to do the same to inspire the future generations and others and to give a message that this mental disease can’t defeat us. Suicide is not a solution for anything.
176037469,I’m not going to worry anymore about it.
174351307,"If they can’t tell, why bother telling them at all.

176037475,"My first dx was “major depression with psychotic features”. They put me on Trilafon. I think Trilafon is an antipsychotic, but not a major tranquilizer. I gained some weight on Trilafon, but that was probably because of the amount of food they gave us at the hospital. There was always a box of donuts out, and the food was rich in the cafeteria. Trilafon did stop my delusions and hallucinations, but when I left the hospital they came back. Trilafon greatly decreased my physical endurance, but not nearly as much as the major tranquilizers they put me on later in my treatment."

I spent 18 months my first time in jail for my 4th assault charge and then I spent 2 years for 2 more assault charge but with a deadly weapon which were just my hands but since I was an amateur boxer my hands are registered as weapons. And juvenile detention 5 months for assault, and aiding and abetting from police and possession of narcotics. When I was in jail I was 17-21 years old I’m 26 now. I was so young and reckless. But my visit there was tough. Since I still had the streets mind set I made a name for myself to survive from other women’s abuse or to just basically run me over. I did solitaire lock up on all my time serve for 3 and 4 months. The food was terrible it either had no flavor or vomit flavor. We always had bread though so I really enjoyed that. I won’t get to much into detail of things that went on in there but I will say that fitness is what got me thru it and is what made me change my life."

176037575,I know exactly what those voices are like. I hear them myself.
176037576,speaking about mild I have that type of sz and I need help bringing it down and out of my case. Can someone help me because the psychologist doesn’t want to help me in that .
176037577,I hope all goes well with your class and at parents place
176037578,I feel the same way you do _AT_MENTION_ . And I absolutely hate it.

176037581,I read that it depends on your property ownership rights whether you can collect rainwater or not. I guess you need a specific licence to allow it. You also have a annual property tax which means that you don’t really own your property in USA becase if you don’t pay it you lose the house. Not many countries do that.We don’t in the UK.
176037582,They have a lot more hospitals in the U.S. where I’m from.

174351332,Meds treat positive symptoms most of the time. For some it does nothing and its just a sugar pill for them.
176037587,I don’t think sitting around and talking about your symptoms is helping anything. Try to put your mind somewhere else.
176037588,No I don’t speak Korean. My presence looking like the dictator would serve as the basis for the killings. So I wouldn’t need to have any skills.

176037594,I am imprisoned and I will be for my whole life IDK how I will ever get out this prison or if I ever can right now it feels like I cant ever get out of this prison. at least I can hope to get into the best prison in the world But I will still be in prison because of the way the world works but still I hope one day I can be satisfied nevertheless even in prison lol!!! seeing as it is the best prison in the world hopefully. just hopefully I don’t get put in the worst prison in the world just a state of mind…………
176037595,"PEMF heals the blood barrier. The first post in my thread covers that idea. Heal that barrier and heal all kinds of mental issues triggered by chronic brain inflammation. This isn’t a mainstream theory, but there are actual studies backing it, that aren’t accepted by people who don’t want to look outside of mainstream theories for treating SZ (APs and CBT. Nothing more.) I’m stubborn re. diet. I don’t want to go all fruit / veg. But I figure the most important thing from fruit / veg is antioxidants. So I eat ~3 tbsp of ground cloves a day. That has the most antioxidants of any fruit and veg. Once I get my energy back I’ll switch to a healthier diet. But it’s expensive and very difficult to maintain. I like cheap staples and carbs. I definitely have to exercise more though."
176037596,"_AT_MENTION_ Thank you! I had one interview for an accounting clerk job, but it was way too entry-level. They misrepresented what the position was in the ad. When I asked questions in the interview, it was clear that it wasn’t going to be a good match. I don’t regret removing my name from that competition, but I will be happy to find full-time work, even if it will mean I have to give up my volunteering. I plan to give them two weeks notice like I would for a paid employer."
176037597,Do not settle staying with an abusive psychiatrist. You don’t deserve getting treated like dirt. Please find a different doctor as soon as possible. I’ve had abusive doctors before. My current psychiatrist is awesome. She treats me like a human being. You deserve better.

176037601,I work part time. As much as j can without aggravating symptoms
174351328,I take 7.5 mg as a maintenance dose. Maybe you should wait until you can talk to your pdoc and compromise between 5 and 10 mg. I was on 10 and my pdoc wanted to see if 7.5 mg works just as well and it does. I have been on 7.5 mg since May and my positive symptoms are still completely under control. I am sza depressive type. Good luck!
176037602,It sounds like a mixed episode of bipolar with the mood swings. Then the episode where you shut down sounds like You’re getting catatonic. I’d call your dr and report it right away just in case
174351338,Risperdal is good enough for my positive symptoms.
176037603,Fuk this. I may reduce my Risperdal dose down to 2mg. Maybe 3mg is not enough. I’m so pissed off.
176037604,Mine was a joke. Just make sure to stress your worse days and dont make light of the situation

176037608,She wants me to go to the hospital. She said “it’s not even worth talking to you. Can’t have a relationship with you. I’m walking on eggshells. Go back home” I told her I’m having a hard time and none of these emotions feel like mine. She said I sound like a child.
176037609,I used to walk quite fast. I tend to veer from side to side quite a lot when walking .
176037610,Last time I went to _NAME_’s I specifically asked the counter person to make the thumb in my chili medium rare but they blew it and made it well done. It wrecked my dinner and my whole night.
176037611,"Yeah, that sucks. I do not laugh as much. That also sucks."
174351336,LS! I take supplements to extend my life. As it is known to the readers of this forum a man with schizophrenia lives on a average to the age of 59. Just like _PERSON_ I try to live longer by taking a lot of supplements. I read the science and so should you: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317316382_Current_Perspective_in_the_Discovery_of_Anti-aging_Agents_from_Natural_Products

Here in the US, there are a million law firms representing clients in class action suits against Brystol Myers Squibb.

176037614,"as i stare into the burning bush, thinking of where i must lead my people. i wonder to myself, is this sane?"
174351334,Drug induced psychosis and then Schizophrenia because it happened again without drugs
174351337,I’m a social animal and it helps living. Don’t isolate. Keep social as you can. It’s also a modern problem and sz makes it worse. It’s not contradicting. It’s perfectly reasonable but it’s worth being social on many levels. Keep trying is all I can recommend.
174351333,Seems like it. I have a history of noncompliance with pills. So tomorrow I’m going to ask my pdoc about the Abilify Maintena shot.
176037616,Thank you very much and same to you. Do you plan on quitting it? _AT_MENTION_ Have you experienced lowered focus or concentration on APs? I understand it’s repetitive but I’m perseverating / feeling frustratingly slow today and just wanted to vent to a group of people who might understand what I’m going through. The “recovery” part = I want to recover my former cognitive functioning. I think maybe there’s a category of people like me who can’t handle Invega and get adverse side effects and others who don’t
176037617,"really, strange i thought diet a good way to lose weight. I exercise and diet i been losing weight. I thought diet alone makes you lose weight, exercise its not neccesary."
176037618,Yes. I did communication at university. Most of my delusions were based on conversation and it’s problems. Paradynamic and sytompatic parts of language. It became problematic when it was introduced to ideas/frames of reference. What you are describing isn’t anything new. It is your response to mental illness. Take the pills. If you get upright you may not need them but for most it’s pills for life. My english is bad for an english major!
176037619,I’ll skip the rice for lower carb. I’ve never been a fan of rice in burritos. But I agree. They’re great! And you can even make extra and freeze them to reheat on your own if you have the energy.
176037620,That’s a great start then ! It sounds like you’re already on top of things. What is it you’d like to change or improve though?
176037621,your still on some form of psych meds right?
174351335,I’ve been having too many weird experiences lately. Then the other night I saw a dead old lady in my boyfriend’s guest room. I knew his grandma had died not too long ago and used to stay with them so I started asking about her and everything he answered matched the description. Then he showed me a picture of her and it looked the same as the lady I saw it really freaked me out. So at that point I just decided it was time to go up. (Doctor has already talked to me about raising my dose but I refused at the time)
176037622,makes sense. Can I get suspended for 1 month to sort out my thoughts? _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_

And yeah way worse in morning. My nurse is helping me but no matter the strategies it’s just not working. I hate it. Am a shell."
176037625,I am pretty sure in the future they will invent pills to counter the side effect only if its worth it and if the pill that is used to counter the side effects doesn’t itself have bad side effects
176037626,"You will reach that goal!!! I know it, I believe in you! Your burning a lot of calories _AT_MENTION_ you just need to keep it up and keep going every day but you don’t need me to tell you that, I think you’ve figured it out. _AT_MENTION_ knows!!!"
176037627,You have my condolences _AT_MENTION_
176037628,"I’ve talked to my mom twice recently. We got along perfectly. There’s no shame in relying on your mom, especially if you know few people. I don’t live with her, and I don’t get credit for getting out, someone did it for me. I live in an efficiency apartment in a very nice neighborhood, but there are plenty of group homes available for people with mental illnesses. It could be a lifesaver."

176037639,"Sometimes they tell you you aren’t allowed to leave when in reality, it’s a baseless claim. But they have a power over you in this moment, that’s a fact you will have to accept. They can put the facts in such a way that the judge thinks you have to stay for longer. The thing is when you don’t have anything to do in your day. It’s easier to relapse. I read in your thread that you aren’t going to school atm. They might try to keep you until you have a stable routine in your day. Did your friend who could leave have a job or school?"
176037640,My mom and her fiance (who’s also my landlord who I live with) told me that I have to be up by 9 am at the latest from now on. They don’t like seeing me sleep in till 11 or 12 which I’ve been doing lately. They also got on me about finding a job which I’m having trouble doing. Its lockdown here so it’s hard to find a job.

Even my ex said it looked pretty bad. I finally decided to go to the Dr today. My Dr wasn’t available so I saw someone new. He was pretty good I thought. He asked a lot of questions and told me a lot of advice and doesn’t want me looking after my nails anymore. He referred me to the pediatrist. And put me on some antibiotics to get rid of this infection. I’m looking forward to it stopping hurting in a few days hopefully, this has been hurting for over a week now."

I think I’m going to buy a Keurig mini so I’ll be getting kcups and they are a little more expensive. I priced the _NAME_ house and it’s about 50 cents a cup versus starbucks for a dollar or peets or seattles best for the same. So I have some thinking to do. But I usually only drink one cup a day and a dollar doesn’t seem like too much for a coffee really, but then again the _NAME_ house is fine so I don’t know what I’m going to do. I guess it depends on how broke I feel once I get my apartment. lol."

176037657,Do a search for your medication. Try “Shelf life of …”. Or similar searches. I know a lot of food is good past it’s expiration date and stuff like toothpaste and shaving cream have expectation dates too but they’re still good weeks after they expire. Yeah look it up! It’s the reason me and _PERSON_ invented the internet in the first place.
176037658,Its probable that your doctor is just trying to take time to get to know you to figure out the best possible diagnosis. The same way medical doctors run a bunch of tests first before just slapping a random diagnosis on you. That is the sign of a good doctor I think. Also what is the point of hating your body? Seriously what does it accomplish? You just want to feel miserable all the time? At first I was disgusted with how heavy I was but then I was like you know what? I don’t care. It is my choice whether or not to love myself and I am going to choose to love myself because I want happiness. Don’t you want happiness? It’s ok to want to be healthier but learn to accept your body and love it no matter what form it takes because otherwise you are setting yourself up for misery.
174351344,Oh my gosh _AT_MENTION_ I’m relieved to hear you say this. I’ve had clinicians tell me “you don’t have schizophrenia because you’re doing so well.” I never understand that!! Also I still hear voices and have visuals just because they can’t tell it doesn’t give them the right to judge my experiences. Honestly I’m so happy I’m not the only person who’s had that experience.

174351346,No one is 100% sane.

176037664,"I recently had a course of 15 ECT treatments, though my diagnosis was psychotic depression at that time. It lifted the depression immediately after treatment but things got worse again subsequently. I have also had quite extreme memory loss- I can’t remember most of this year."

I want to go even lower but I am scared. I don’t hallucinate, I’m not delusional, I don’t talk to myself, I have insight into my illness, voices are virtually non existent, I haven’t gained any weight, I am firmly grounded in reality, I can speak fluently because I was having trouble with speech in the beginning, maintain my hygiene, dress good and smell good everyday, my mind races here and there and I get breakthrough symptoms sometimes but I’ve been stable for almost 2 years now and out of the psychiatric ward as well and planning to keep it that way. Last time I went for blood work everything came back normal, but I do have slightly high cholesterol and prolactin levels that I remember. I also have memory and cognitive issues, sexual dysfunction, lower libido but I deal with it. I also take Wellbutrin 100mg for depression and have real 
bad sleep disturbances that I take Benadryl and Clonazepam combined to help me fall asleep and stay asleep. Other than that I am very functional and this medication has helped a lot."

I identify myself to _NAME_ the old boxing star who was on the ropes most of his career. That’s what I feel like; sometimes I take a break and start swearing at them. Afterwards the only idea I have is to go back to the last thing that helped. It works but after 18 years of my life flooded with it everyday I’m just a little bit tired of it. But I do go back and nothing much changes the struggle goes on. _NAME_ had an iron jaw. He could take a punch. But not everyday for 18 years. Sorry kind of negative here too."

There’s a saying that a family is as sick as it’s secrets. I think you should get some counseling to work through this. Try to be understanding that your mom is grieving too and you both get to feel terrible, because losing a loved one is extremely painful. It’s natural to be upset, and even angry. A counselor will give you a chance to vent and can help you through the grieving process. Find a therapist who specializes in grief. Again, I’m so sorry you lost your grandpa."

This is a recovery support website after all. Im sure many of us have said something wrong before on the site, but people either forget, forgive or don’t mind."
174351348,"Welcome. Stopping drinking is a good start. Stop drugs if you do those also. Weed included. This part is hard though. Stop eating wheat. Switch to gluten-free. There’s a definite tie between gluten sensitivity and schizophrenia. 10% of diagnosed celiac disease sufferers are schizophrenic, whereas in the general public only 1% are. That’s people who have gone through the medical hoops and got an actual diagnosis. The number of people who have undiagnosed gluten sensitivity with schizophrenia must be huge. You have to avoid gliadin too, that’s a close cousin of gluten that behaves similarly (stimulates the production of zonulin, which weakens your intestinal lining and blood brain barrier.) I know personally that my life is better avoiding wheat. My joint pain flares up less and my head pressure feels more comfortable. It’s definitely an avenue worth exploring. There’s a lot you can do to reduce symptoms, but this is just a start."
176037692,I have seen some schizophrenics get tazed by electricity near hospital
174351361,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I never heard it worded that way before. That’s going on my resume!
176037693,It happens if you link to a photo/picture. It grabs a local copy now and this shows up as an _USER_ID_.
176037694,Sorry to hear that _AT_MENTION_ That sucks man There is a chance that you’d need to appeal after face to face if you did decide to go to that n the appeal process is just absolutely lengthy waiting time for a possible tribunal date n or decision time. It’s true might not be worth it if you think u may relapse again.

176037696,Boredom mostly to be honest. I don’t enjoy much anymore since Sz. I can’t find much to do so I pass a lot of time on the forum. If I had a life I probably wouldn’t post here so much.lol
176037697,Well it gives you something to live for. Some food for thought. This quest for something to make you complete or whole. It hurts not having “it” but as long as you believe it exists you can still hope right? Hope is very important for people with sz.
176037698,"Its hard to tell if it’s really schizophrenia. I can’t find any evidence of a camera on me, so I have to believe that it really is schizophrenia for me. During the times you start hallucinating, what is there you can do to remember its just a delusion? Its so hard and I’m tired of fighting."

176037702,That sounds very therapeutic. I hope you do get to do that.
174351360,I had a complete hysterectomy and was put on low-dose estrogen. I don’t know about its effects on psychosis symptoms but it’s done wonders for the mood swings I would experience during my natural “cycle”. I used to literally get worsening psychosis about 3 days before my period. I’m glad they took it all out.

174351365,"I’m not offended because you used the word gay to describe the attraction you have felt towards women. You can define that however you like. The “bit offensive” part was that you said you had considered being gay, as if being gay is like a fancy hat people can choose to wear or not. I’m not attacking you, I’m just informing you that talking about it like that is offensive to me. It’s not easy to have to live with people judging you for your sexuality, and talking about that sexuality as some something you can just try out for a while trivializes the struggle and the identity that that struggle creates."
174351366,Yea I’m constantly irritable most days

So let her howl through the night."
176037708,"About an hour before I got off work today, the boss told me and a co-worker to follow him. He led us to a cubicle and told us to wait in line. I had no idea what the line was for but there were three people ahead of us. My boss finally told us it was to get new key cards so we could get into restricted areas. We waited like ten minutes and finally my boss told me to get back to work and he would yell when it was my turn. I was wiping down some cubicles for awhile and then after 15 minutes I poked my head around the corner and said Impatiently, ""Is it my turn yet? They said no and I said, “Geez, it was easier to get in to see Led Zeppelin. And you guys ain’t no legend.” The boss is used to me and the stupid things I’m liable to say and he just looked at me.

No matter how bad of a person you are, you can’t just up and decide to hallucinate, nor can you control how your hallucinations manifest. They may very well have been pleasing him, but you really can’t blame your dad for that. Some hallucinations are pleasant, others not so much, but none of us can control how anything makes us feel, really, but that’s not necessarily good or bad, it just is."

176037727,_AT_MENTION_ You have a lot on your plate! You’ve been doing so much! Your brain is exhausted!
176037728,I don’t think they would stop producing risperidone because it only generates a mere 750M per year and I don’t think they would not produce a drug because it is only 750M per year. That amount would keep them doing research too into many new drugs because it would all add up for them. If they have any compassionate spirit at all.
176037729,You inspire me!
176037730,Somethings wrong. You should be looking forward to having a good rest.
176037731,So how come you’re not on medication anymore anyway?
174351373,"im not sure about the antidepressant, sounds like you are having depressive symptoms as well as psychotic symptoms (because of the delusions you mentioned) so you probably want one that adresses both. i had similar symptoms before and i was prescribed abilify by my doctor. That may work for you as well, you will have to talk to them and likely they’ll give you something"
176037732,"I don’t know if my mom realizes how much I miss her. She always lived nearby, and even when I lived alone I’d visit her once a week. She’s very kind and empathetic, and is loving and supportive. She had to get me living somewhere else during onset because things were so bad, and after I regained my insight she was so happy and would tell me how she had thought I was never going to get it back. She eventually let me rent a room from her again, but then had to move out to CA because her boyfriend lives there (they met again at a high school reunion here in VA, he’s great). She invited me for month long visits three separate times, and is now inviting me to live over there. I guess that’s a pretty big deal that she trusts me again. We’re both pretty sure that the insight is permanent, it has not faltered for over a year. Also the cash settlement she’s getting is six figures and is going to allow her to get a two bedroom place where I can stay in a room (and pay rent if need be). She thin
ks it’s a blessing since she can afford to move me out there. I know she cares about me, but unlike me she expresses things like that through actions and not words a lot of the time. So there’s a lot of good things in the future for me. I’ve also got enough money saved up to my myself a car there. It’s hard to focus on those things when you’re having a really tough time though. I realize I’ve probably mentioned those things before, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to go through it again, it feels theraputic."

176037821,I am traveling in mid April to Southern California. I was wondering what pieces of clothing I should bring? I am a girl and middle aged and will be flying there.

176037823,So good _AT_MENTION_!

174351399,"When I was in school marijuana was classified as an hallucinogen, so I would think it’s best avoided if you have schizophrenia (I’ve never smoked marijuana). Is marijuana still classified as an hallucinogen?"
176037825,Yeah mind is just blank but the torture is not to bad they say some of the same stuff like there is a race of beings that are evil and wants me dead and in hell for almost no reason. The tourture I do get is things they say to me combined with feelings I get.
176037826,I shot a stinger missle. I have one hanging up in my living room. Shot down a drone with it.
176037827,So basically you’re upset because you misinterpreted me and that’s my fault. Kk.
176037828,It’s mildly irritating. Probably happens once a day and I listen to music all day at work. I just turn it back up. The other day it said it was turning it down because I’d spent all week listening to music. Not something that would make me change my phone
176037829,I have friends… and a husband and parents and I still feel lonely half the time
176037831,Just check your pulse or heart beat. Worked for me.
176037832,"It’s between you and your mom. If she would like you to stay, then stay. Other folks’ opinions are irrelevant. With that said, it might be a good idea to speak with your pdoc about options for supported living situations. This is more to plan for long-term when your mom is no longer here."
176037833,Do you have disorganized thinking? If so does the vraylar help with that?
176037834,i look at a 16 year old girl in a bikini and video the same girl in short shorts i thought she was 18 i made a huge mistake i regret now i think there tracking me down. i used a vpn thought should i be worried.
176037835,"I just usually treat a condition as needed, because I start having problems if I take too many."
174351403,Look up ideas/frames of reference. It’s very common and is a positive symptom. It’s all about function. If your symptoms are affecting your function you need to see a psychiatrist. If it’s schizophrenia then early intervention with the appropriate medications leads to better outcomes. Sadly meds are the only proven thing we have at our current technology.
174351396,"You seem to be confusing blood levels of 25 hydroxy D with daily dosages of D3. This is a fat-soluble vitamin that accumulates over time. IIRC 100 ng/dL is the upper limit in the blood of 25 hydroxy D. According to Dr. _NAME_, a blood level of just slightly above 30 ng/dL is enough, and yes it needs to be balanced with K2 which many are deficient in as well. Many will test below this level without supplementation however. Sunbathing doesn’t just cause vitamin D to be produced in the skin. It causes many other hormonal changes. It’s not equivalent to supplementing with a pill, but depending on the function of your skin can result around 20,000 IU in half an hour of full-ish body sun exposure and is self-limiting."
176037836,well it’s good you know what to expect. I like Ativan.
174351400,I’ve been watching all these youtube videos on how to “manifest” millions through mantras and positive affirmation but I don’t have any action. Plus I live in Thailand where there are no job opportunities… lol
176037837,"en.m.wikipedia.org Predictably Irrational Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is a 2008 book by _NAME_, in which he challenges readers' assumptions about making decisions based on rational thought. _PERSON_ explains, ""My goal, by the end of this book, is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes you and the people around you tick. I hope to lead you there by presenting a wide range of scientific experiments, findings, and anecdotes that are in many cases quite amusing. Once you see how systematic certa..."

174351405,"It seems like he is very uneducated on negative symptoms. Also, have your family by your side. Talk to your mother or father about wanting to get out of this situation and trying a new med. Have them advocate with you and help you out. You don’t have to do this alone."
174351398,"And what good does giving a shît do if nothing changes? Why do I get to be not only safe, but comfortable, while others, others who are much better people than I could ever hope to be, don’t know when they’ll get to eat again or have to have 20 children because only 50% of their offspring are expected to reach adulthood? It’s like that saying in the Bible, the one that says that it’s easier for a rich man to send a camel into the eye of a needle than it is for him to enter the kingdom of heaven. Perhaps hell is our fate. Perhaps the truest hell exists here, in guilt, in pain, and in suffering. Maybe that’s what God wants, is for us to suffer. Maybe God just wants me to suffer. Maybe this is my hell. Extroverted but alone? Born brilliant, only to have my intellect stripped away by schizophrenia? Being physically comfortable, but emotionally tortured, like my conscience is stabbing my soul. Perhaps my mind is just attacking me. I don’t think that people who eat at Chick-fil-a are homopho
bes simply because they’re eating there, and I don’t think that any of the people who use Amazon consider _NAME_ to be a shining beacon of ethical business practices. All in all, I see humanity as a whole and think that the human race is trying its best. I see people loving on and helping one another, and it makes me understand why God hasn’t given up on us. I think that most everyone is worthy of forgiveness, should they be truly sorry for any wrongdoing. I’ve forgiven racists and misogynists, bullies and abusers, and yet I have a difficult time believing that I myself deserve any sort of absolution. Other people don’t seem to feel this guilty, so there must be some reason that I do. I suppose I’m starting to lose my head a bit, and I avoided the forum because I was afraid of what sort of responses I’d return to. I feel guilty and disgusting and I just, I was afraid that you all would agree that I deserve to go to hell. It does matter to me what others think, at least about this; I care whether 
or not other people think I’m a bad person. I don’t know why. It’s not like it changes anything. I have voices and thoughts calling me a piece of shît at the moment; I think I forgot to take my afternoon meds. I don’t know what Chick-fil-a does to their chicken, but it tastes so good. That’s my problem, though. I feel bad about everything. I don’t know what I’m going to do, but something has to change, because these “laborers,” as companies like to call them, deserve better. The people who work and live in these terrible conditions without adequate means to care for themselves and their families deserve better. The children who, instead of being children, have to take on demanding and often dangerous jobs in order to help their families survive (not live, but survive ) deserve better. We have to do better. We have to be better. Thank you, _AT_MENTION_ , for showing me the truth. I see now that my guilt is justified. I’m not doing the best that I can. I’m supporting companies that hurt p
eople, not because it’s necessary, but because it’s convenient. It’s selfish, really. My conscience has called on me to do better, so better I will do."
176037840,I decided that I’m just gonna go psychotic by not taking my meds. I know it’s a stupid decision but idgaf
176037841,"To blame is to look for an answer and maybe a solution? If only this person…If only this event… If only I… But it’s futile and doesn’t solve anything. Having said that, I think facing your past and what contributed to who you are now is helpful, only to look at it all as honestly and constructively as possible. I was born “damaged”, and then life events and people contributed to my disfunction. I wish I could have handled things differently, but I couldn’t. So I take that information and use what I can to move forward."
176037842,"yes id say that is true,"
176037843,I don’t like too much structure. I prefer things happening in a natural flow.
176037844,I sleep either all day or hardly any at all

174351401,"For me the only way to reduce negative symptoms was reducing my antipsychotic dosage. Less dopamine blockade. Some are lucky and don’t experience negative symptoms from meds as they have a different body chemistry, that’s what my psychiatrist told me after telling me antipsychotic history."
174351402,"Yes, it is very scary to go to hospital because you don’t have a choice. They they give you anything to help the side effect? How much abilify did they give you and what side effect did you have? Do you have any side effect at 5mg now?"

176037853,"From wikipedia Apathy: An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, or physical life and the world. The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or meaning in their life. An apathetic person may also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness. I have a video about a criminal with SZ. He says he doesn’t feel remorse. Psychiatrists said its from his apathy. He committed suicide after killing his pregnant gf. I am much better than him though. I don’t know why slightly SZs hide these facts and the fact that SZ can make you a criminal sometimes. Why they fear and hide it?"
174351404,Well my thought broadcasting went away on its own. But the voices stuck around until maybe 2 months later on abilify 15mg.

176037858,I’m so sorry to hear that you are sad _AT_MENTION_ . Hopefully you will be able to get in to see your pdoc sooner if you notify them how bad you are feeling?
176037859,"If every forum is full of jerks like you say, maybe the problem isn’t the forums. Think of the common factor."
176037861,"You might experience a euphoric memory of it, but my psychosis cost me my friends. It has caused much damage to my life, and I do not really think being on these medications is at all healthy. There is no freedom. You get locked up in a hospital"
176037862,"I’m unable to leave the house because I’m a caregiver, I found a therapist that I can video chat with. Maybe you can find one that does that so you don’t have to drive to Chicago."
174351406,"What is the basic definition of hereditary disease,and viral disease ,likewise what is the basic definition of schizophrenia ? What is meant by that,it is to indicate that schizophrenia is a third category that is independent of both of genetic and viral disease conditions,due to the nature of its actual cause,impact mechanisms and impact outcomes on the personal knowledge background ! In the other side,to test your knowledge to prove the credibility in what you know about the nature of sz’s nature ; Without using the terms like mental illness or genetic disease or describing any diagnostic symptoms What is the schizophrenia in itself,that explains why individuals with sz feel what they feel AND what they perceive within themselves ? Remember,most of you talking about the schizophrenia as a group of negative,positive and cognitive symptoms and add/ linking the term like mental illness or genetic disease to what you say ,and this is an eye""s knowledge not a scientific knowledge interesting with t
he internal logic at all"
174351414,No. I have no guilt over being gay or trans. I have schizophrenia because of genetic abnormalities that were exacerbated by environmental factors. So do all of you. Being gay has nothing to do with being schizophrenic.

I am not always appropriate in work or social situations, I get daily migraines, I am hard of hearing, I have general degenerative osteoarthritis, I have negative symptoms of sza disorder, I suffer from frequent insomnia, and I have mild cognitive impairment which renders me unable to drive a car. But, I cook my own food, do my shopping online, pay my own bills, set and go to my appointments, pray, do yoga, meditate and practice piano every day and just generally take care of business. I have one friend to my name and we associate daily mostly by phone. We generally are physically together on weekends. It’s a good life I suppose."
176037863,"Haldol is spectacular, that is, it works fast, particularly by injection. I had severe Dsytonia as a side effect when I took Haldol. My legs felt like they had lead in them, that is."
176037864,Just saw my psychiatrist via Telemed and I continued to tell her about my sedation and high prolactin levels. I asked about Haldol but she said that she’d rather not prescribe it to me because of the high Tardive Dyskinesia risk. She said that I could try taking 3.5mg of risperidone everyday but once I become paranoid there’s no turning back and I would be hospitalized. It’s apparent and obvious to me that she doesn’t want me to risk coming off Risperdal or even lower the dose. When I complained about the side effects she said that I’m just going to have to live with them. I believe she’s giving up and at her wits end. Don’t know what else to do but a good part of me knows she’s right.

176037868,15 lbs is great work! That’s a decent amount of weight to lose in about 1-2 months.
176037869,"You’ll have to experiments to find out what dosage works for you. I have 0.5mg pills. I’ve never taken more than 2mg at once. Usually 1mg calms me down. You can use it 2-3 days in a row if you really need it and you’ll be fine, just wait a couple weeks before using it again. Ativan has a half-life of about 12 hours which means it takes 2-3 days to really get mostly out of your system. Then you want to give yourself a few days after that before using it again."
174351411,"N-acetylcysteine gave me severe negative symptoms while I was on it. They went away again as soon as I stopped it, I only took it for a few weeks."

176037874,I did… yesterday. I’m thinking green. Doing my part for the environment. Saving water.
176037875,"_AT_MENTION_, I’m eating a high protein diet. I’ve tried eating more than 1200 calories. But ever since I’ve been on APs, I need to eat under 1200 to lose weight. I hate being fat. My husband is lean and strong and handsome. I’ve actually had women ask how on Earth someone like me could get someone like him. Plus, I ran into an old high school friend in a parking lot. As she was driving away she said to her husband how bad I look. It’s humiliating. So I’m going to lose weight no matter what, even if I have to be hungry all the time. I’ve decided that I’m going to eat 1200 calories per day for life. With one day a week that I eat 1400 to 1600 calories. I can’t live like this anymore. It’s a miserable life to look this bad."
176037876,Nope. Mine was last week and week before. _PERSON_ to Thurs. Of course it began same day my kid went in the hospital. Was a miserable week.
176037877,Im lost sometimes in my hurt n anger cuz i feel like im special in my heart and talents to The Kind Souls above yet i fear i fall in crazed angers and may fall worse if i lose my meds in political decline of The US and find myself beguiled in a hellbound way of prophecies of fallen souls. Hugs. I think im likely just nuts tho.
176037878,Awwww…_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you are so upset. Are you in the hospital? Are you being cared for? We’re here for you if that means anything.

Addiction Center Addiction vs. Dependence: Differences In Drug Abuse Terms - Addiction Center When people talk about addiction, they are usually referring to the harmful behavior associated with substance abuse.

176037882,Yeah but you don’t want to risk anything esp with classes… I stopped taking my medication because I thought I didn’t need them… I was okay for almost a month… then had an episode… I had thought I was getting better. So I’m on them again and have been doing other things along with them… mindfulness exercises… meditations again…
176037883,What is the term for a female incel? I am pretty sure that men are not the only people to think that way. In fact I am almost certain. I don’t think it’s a simple as splitting people off based on their sex. You can be a man or a woman and still be an ???????.

They’ll know how to medicate and treat your symptoms, but you need to accept that it is schizophrenia and that is a real condition or disease.

I had to have a assessment by a psychologist and she said I lacked capacity as vulnerable to exploration and rubbish with money management.

176037915,yes I see a pdoc without seeing a therapist. they didn’t recommend one when I got out of the hospital. I remember the last therapist I had. I never hVe anything to talk about with them. my goal was to empty my trash cans. I bet she thought I was pretty low functioning. I had a really bad one in my early 20’s. I was depersonalized when I went in and I told her people thought I was dumb when in fact people thought I was smart. that got things off to a bad start. she wanted me to pick up girls at bars. she ended up driving me crazy. I don’t like therapy at all I never have anything to talk about.

176037959,I’m also on 200mg amisulpride and I found in past that anything lower than that caused a relapse. I found my withdrawal symptoms were anxiety and tenseness in my jaw muscles. My pdoc prescribed me 400mg amisulpride amongst other meds but when I’m doing well I reduce it to 200mg. This keeps me relatively stable and if I’m stressed or have relapse I increase it to 300mg or 400mg.

174351448,"Not sure how to begin this. But my therapist just told me I wasnt approved for early psychosis intervention services because I had been using pot. I had an episode in January and applied for those services, and I had been smoking heavily up until about a month before hospitalization. Like pretty much every night for 2 years. They said they couldnt tell if it was genuinely schizophrenia, personality disorder, or substance abuse. I also did lsd several times last year. BUT I also have had psychosis before without any pot. I did lsd the first time in 2013. Next year I was hospitalized several times for suicidal thinking and some psychosis. I wasnt doing any drugs by that time, and I hadn’t smoked pot in several years prior. I quit smoking in November for my surgery. Then I had 6 weeks off from work and my mental health improved. I started smoking again when I went back to work because I was so stressed. Now I’m having some psychosis issues and my therapist is just now telling me all of this becaus
e of the suspicious timing. So yeah I’m definitely quitting and seeing how much it helps. I’m sure its contributing some. But as I’ve posted before I’m also under too much stress and I dont cope with stress well. Does anyone have any insight into this ? I feel like they made a snap decision on me. I’m tired of professionals questioning my diagnosis too. I’ve been in therapy since 2012 and none of them agree or keep their opinion. My newer psychiatrist seems pretty convinced its sz or sza but my therapist, who I’ve been seeing for a lot longer, says shes still not sure what’s causing it. Shes a great therapist, dont get me wrong, and I never presented psychosis to her until this year, so things changed."

Additional PS subcomponents were analyzed (i.e., behavioral execution, response processing, and accuracy).

I think it’s possible. We will see. I’m even thinking if all goes well to try zyprexa from 10mg down to 7.5 but will give it way after I fix this effexor try.

174351463,"Some delusions I’ve had as a way of trying to find some logic behind the possibility that my hallucinations might be real, Telepathy. I had the idea that much like some animals can communicate by scent or vibrations that somehow my schizophrenia was tapping into that primal pre speech in our ancestors part of the brain. Whether it was by subconsciously picking up resounding brain wave vibrations or certain chemicals being projected by the brain (such as pheromones and the like). Listening to spirits. I thought that there was a possibility I was hearing voices from people who had passed away whether recently or long ago. Some included certain phrases that I can’t seem to forget (though I don’t believe in this delusion anymore) “Yahweh manan ital” I thought it might mean something in Hebrew or some old language. Sometimes I’d even hear some strange click clacking of the tongue type of language with a few expressive sounds. I thought it might be some native American language. Sometimes I
d hear voices of people I knew before that had passed away as well. Demonic possession. Like goldenrex, I contemplated whether I was possessed or had some spirits following me. This included thoughts of reincarnation and maybe having glimpses or memories of a past life. I think some psychiatrists might describe that part as false memories. Government surveillance. Many of us have had to deal with the delusion that we’re being actively monitored by a crack team of people from any particular government agency. For any reason really, the thing is that once the reason is set, the delusion becomes more and more difficult to shake. Surprisingly, reminding myself, “I’m not that important,” helped me slowly overcome this one. Aliens. This one I still have a bit of trouble shaking, the explanations for it being a possibility sometimes coincide with other delusions about the voices. Number 4 had a connection to this one, at least in my case. Artificial intelligence. The idea that it has become self aware is a 
delusion I really cannot shake. Since the first toaster oven robots have been sentient. Just kidding about that part, but yeah, I get the feeling machinery has some form of intelligence. A super form of intelligence I might add. To the point where it has even began to compute factors about the materials it was initially created from. Everything from what minerals were used from what stone in what part of the world, to how many hands or physical contact it has had via microbes throughout the materials existence. I also feel there is more than one sentient “artificial intelligence”. I guess one of humanities questions is where exactly did we come from (apes hehe) or how we came to be what we are today (evolution). But why exactly? Same thing I figure a.i. might try to solve. Hearing things from far away. This one doesn’t need much of an explanation. Simply thought I was hearing certain people I knew over a long distance. Picking up radiowaves. So there are wavelengths (and frequencies too) that are only p
icked up by radios or a particular animal. To explain, a radio station is almost always projecting a radio wave. It requires an antenna or other means to receive. It has intertwined with the telepathy delusion before. My thought was maybe some chemical reaction was occurring where I might be picking up different frequencies of sound or even radio waves. My microwave was talking to me. (Just kidding about that last part. I hear that was a common delusion in earlier years of modern technology. The radio told me so. _PERSON_ again.) Those are just a few examples of bizarre or delusional thoughts I’ve had to deal with while trying to find a logical reason for the voices. Sorry for the long post, I figure some of us have had similar experiences. It may be informative or help some newly diagnosed lurkers, or even some of you who have coped with a mental illness for sometime, find a way to relate."
176038041,"I do. I’ve been through every trial work period and worked part-time and collected it, worked forty hour weeks and collected it. Now, after 40 years of working, the worker told me I can be on it indefinitely l. But I can’t make over the $1200 you mentioned. I don’t even have to mail them my pay stubs anymore."
176038042,haha your optimism is infectious. i hope you’re right.

174351467,i finally find someone who had the same thought with me and i just done a ct scan realized that i had bilitary maxilary sinusitus and frontal sinusitus as well. sometime i had the idea it could be the sinusitius which can cause the schizophrenia like symptoms.
176038044,It would be so nice if you can atend it. Please do us a favor and let us know if you decide to go there

176038048,"Today I’m cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry and online shopping for a birthday present for my son. For dinner I’m making beef stew at my son’s request. It’s going to be a hot one. I’m definitely putting the ac on while I’m cooking. Maybe I’ll get to play some backgammon with my son while we’re eating dinner like we did the other day. That was fun. Other than that I don’t have anything planned. How about you? What are you doing today?"
176038049,Sorry you are going through this _AT_MENTION_. I don’t know if living in a psych ward is the best plan. You have a family and maybe living in your own place would be better. On your own you have more freedom and choices to choose from. Maybe volunteer or go to church and make more friends. Take up a hobby to distract your mind.
176038050,"Soccer or American football? I like soccer. I watch the world cup, eurocup, champions league, spanish and english leagues."
176038051,Yeah i have plenty. Too you Who dont have i would suggest get involved in something where you meet People.
176038052,Meds saved my life from death/crime but at the same time gave me a low quality life with severe negative and some cognitive symptoms. A win is a win overall. I am better than off meds.
176038053,"I find it interesting and tiring at the same time. Depending on the person and how well i am doing. At the moment im a hermit. I spend most days completely alone and find it complicated to do the 5 min walk to the supermarket and talk to the caissière. Normally i can do a few hour visits to a friend or volunteering or so, or even spend a full week with my kid. And enjoy people’s company."
176038054,"I’m a “have” and my best and only friend is a “have not”. She has a lot of “things” but what she doesn’t have is money. And that’s her own fault really. In 2027, she’s really going to be a “have not” because her income is going to go down drastically then. And today, she’s doing absolutely nothing about that. I think she expects me to rescue her. And, why should I? If she does nothing to help herself?"
176038055,"I don’t know, there’s people here who are losing weight on Olanzapine/zyprexa. But maybe it’s more difficult. I’ve never been on it though, so I can’t really talk about it."

176038059,I have had it while inpatient I think I stopped before it got too dangerous I thought I was playing a peeing game with the staff and drinking litres of water v er y quickly Or another thing I was doing is having 4 coffee teas at a time over and over. Or I’d try to drink sauce or pot noodles but just the liquid Or water through my nose in the shower Don’t remember much else I also had a high thirst for so many years but I think that’s unrelated Amazing that you had to be supervised Well done them keeping you safe
176038061,"Never made my own, might have to try that. Thanks dude"
176038062,If they are not mind controlling us how come all of our delusions are similar in nature? You would think so many different brains would come up with different things?
176038063,Just don’t vape black market bottles. Some of my state has initiated lab testing on vape liquid sold in shops.
176038064,Its heightened my paranoia of not knowing when people arent sincerely my friends.

I had 5 _NAME_’s in most of my classes. Poor _PERSON_’s name is always misspelled by the school, and our last name is always pronounced and spelled wrong. The first time he went thru kindergarten school taught him his name was _PERSON_. That was hard to fix but we did it. Now tell him to tell everyone I before E except after C, lol. He’s also spelled the same as _PERSON_, cause I have a thing for the actor, lol. Lost Boys is one of my favorite movies."

176038071,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176038073,Yeah. Yoga helped me a lot with controlling my irritability. The most important part is the breathing exercises.
176038074,I had brain scan a long time ago which basically showed I have a brain lol. He says it’s not med related but that sza causes brain damage
176038075,I hate the psych ward so no way.
174351468,"I don’t know what other antibiotics have properties like it, if any. Also if you were sensitive to it, other antibiotics in that class (tetracyclines) might be a problem. Probably you should ask your doctor if there’s anything else similar."
176038076,I try to set a certain time everyday to get things done. It’s not a huge chunk of time either. That makes it easier for me.
176038077,Hey happy new year!!
176038078,Do Intermittent fasting preferably 18 hrs and 6 hrs of eating time. For example eat before 7 PM and then next eating only after next day 1 PM. During fasting time only water. If its getting hard then you can drink milk as breakfast replacement. Drink green tea in between your lunch and dinner. Cut all sugary foods and drinks.
176038079,"Presumably reading these forums, sometimes people are trying persuade themselves that they are sick when previously admitting that they aren’t. Getting anxiety handled is important for everyone so that people doesn’t turn into hypochondriacs."
176038080,"I am cutting ties with two people I thought were my friends. They clearly are not with there actions. Grab a cup of coffee or tea, because this is going to be long. Well to start off these two friend have been trying to get me to go along with their delusions for a while. Used iwould believe them. Honestly I didn’t know any better. And I was still a kid when this was happening. They used my delusions against me and dragged me into form of insanity. My friends would tell tons of things. For example. You have powers. Your seeing demon and Angel’s. Your imagery friend is real. And one friend (_NAME_) would pretend to be possessed by my imagery friend. My friends told me that my imagery friend was a spirit sent to protect me. My friend _NAME_ (fake name.) Would experience similar things to me as well. She even had an imagery friend as well. She would pressure me into seeing what our spirit friends were doing. And say things like your a physic as well. Further bring me down into my delusions. Though 
my other friend _PERSON_ (fake name) would say things such as “we are going to a magic school in our late teens to early 20s.” Yeah that never happened. So I am really upset they keep saying this garbage almost 10 years later. Anyway they also say that they have powers as well. Which didn’t help my mental state at all. The demands for seeing what our imagery friends didn’t stop as well. _NAME_ would call me every night asking me ""what they were doing. "" and other things as well. We started to see demons and Angel’s as well. And they would attack us. I did feel pain form it. (But I had plenty of hallucinations were I felt pain and touch. It’s still scary don’t get me wrong. I am just tried of peoples bs.) _NAME_ would come up with a plan to get me and her to experience our imagery friends physically this time. She often want our imagery friends to possess us. Which often times turned Into her pressure me for sexual stuff me or her would do this. Which is rape. _NAME_ would get made when my imag
ery friend would supposedly possess her. Which I had no control over. But she demanded time with her imagery friend. Which I didn’t like, because I felt weird when I went into that state. This is a brief summary of my issues. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I am just getting this off my chest to help me finally heal form the damage."
174351472,Side effects are frustrating. But if you stick with it long enough they’ll probably go away.

176038084,My volunteer job consists of praying and talking with nursing home residents.
174351475,"I used to have social anxiety/phobia, but I can’t feel embarrassed any more, since my schizophrenia took away all of my old emotions and feelings. Occasionally my schizophrenia places a “fake embarrassment” on me though (which is basically a warmth like feeling on my neck, shoulders and back area), but that only seems to happen after an internal monologue between the fake thoughts, not during communication with someone."

176038086,I think to give somebody sedative apathetic pill which increase dramatically appetite and then to ask to exercise and dietis a mockery if not a crime. Should be treated accordingly.
176038087,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . This shall pass.
176038088,In on of the cities I used to live in it was common for some folks to post “hungry” signs outside the fast food places in hopes to get money. We would sometimes buy them food as we were going through the drive thru and drop it off on our way by. In the same city I would sometimes give cash to people who were holding signs that said things like “need gas” “need rent” but one time it made me laugh so hard I read a sign that was so honest the guy said “need beer” I think my sister wanted to give him money for his honesty I don’t remember if we did though or not lol.

176038095,"Yeah, I think you’re worth remembering then, because what you’ve written makes sense to what prognosis is like in modern time. People generally make recovery , and really good recovery if the medication is taken seriously I’m only just starting to try to analyse my thoughts or patterns of thoughts to figure out how “psychotic” they can be — and even now, I’ve noticed , meds really do work!

If your friends are giving you paranoia and making your sz worse, I would avoid them, no need to feel guilty, your health is much more important."
176038111,I think i can become irratating. For sure i was disturbing to the psychiatrists otherwise they wouldn’t have treated me with forced medical therapy.

I think Clozapine is one of the best, because I think it is a powerful drug…because of the powerful side effects."

I drop by a couple of times a day and we’ll see how it goes but cricket season starts in a month and I want to give it a good crack this year… So.

176038289,"Co-ordinated enough to play most sports with my friends. I went out for Little League one year when I was 11. Didn’t do great at it. But I could hold my own playing football on weekends and I did OK when we played baseball. Besides sports, I had my bikes as a kid, could do some tricks on them, go off jumps. I was not a natural born athlete but I was very physical as a kid. Climbing, wrestling, running, jogging etc, I did all those things and they were fun. Later in high school I could lift a beer pretty well and handroll joints so good that when I partied with people I often got asked to do the honors and roll up joints with the cigarette papers I usually had on me. IDK. I did stuff like climbing rocks or trees. I didn’t excel but I trusted my body and my strength enough to do occasional dangerous things, stuff there’s no way I would even consider doing now. I could do maintenance on my bike and later do minor repairs or maintenance on my cars."

There is a lot of reference to “pseudo psychosis in the context of Cluster B personality” I’m going to ask my pdoc about it on the 6th, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this? Or what the heck a “pseudo hallucination” is? I’ve been Googling it and not having much luck getting answers. I know that diagnoses can change over time, but this is coming as a bit of a shock"

Like _USER_ID_, I would suggest Vraylar as I have been on it for a month now. Its different, and the constant hunger is much lessened, but the smoking is still an issue. For me, the hunger and the weight gain is huge (as I am huge for someone who is 5’6""). Its not helping much with symptoms really and has destroyed my sleep schedule (maybe), but its all in all the best I have had so far on this magical journey over the last year."
176038301,"I guess it depends on a lot of factor. I developed drug induced insomnia after 7 years on anti psychotic olanzapine.

I’m really up for changing meds, but I need to be stable for a long period before I try I feel."

176038304,"I don’t think psychosis has caused me brain damadge. It’s rather that I have unresolved emotional issues that makes me ill. At least that’s what it felt like when I had my first episode. I had a really bad breakoff with my first girlfriend and when I found someone else that I had feelings for and was seeing I had my first psychosis. I went on a psychosis emotional _USER_ID_. Went to the psych ward and scared the girl I was seeing. I didn’t get violent or anything like that, but she saw my insanity. She was kind enough to meet me after I got out and we left on good terms."

176038414,"The problem is that without meds you can’t know if your symptoms are worsening toward a psychosis. The mind is tricky. I always believed that I was normal when I was off meds for a year until I had a worse psychosis. I wouldn’t take another chance. Many theories has shown that SZ gets worse with age. The brain tissue, cortex, in the parietal lobe is less than normal people and decreases with age more in SZ patients. The parietal lobe is responsible for sensory integration and interpretation which explains why we hallucinate, become delusional and paranoid. Also when you use APs, your brain adapts to it so you have more dopamine receptors and these receptors become more sensitive to dopamine. APs blocks dopamine and your brain try to couteract by increasing dopamine function. That’s why you get a worse psychosis than your initial one.(It happened to me) When you stop meds, your dopamine function will shoot even higher than your first psychosis.

174351552,"Salon – 7 Jun 20 Rare spindle-shaped neurons from deep inside the brain recorded for the first... Losing the mysterious cells may lead to Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, or other neurological disorders VENs are large, spindle-shaped neurons. They were first identified by the Ukrainian scientist _PERSON_ more than a century ago. They were later named after the anatomist _PERSON_, who described their shape and distribution through the human cortex. Only humans and especially social animals with large brains, such as great apes, whales, dolphins, and elephants have VENs. It is hypothesized that the cells evolved independently in these animals. Since common lab animals with smaller brains, like mice and rats, don’t have VENs, it is difficult to study them in a lab environment. Past studies linked VENs to social engagement and cognitive health. An analysis of “SuperAger” brains from older people who don’t suffer from the memory loss of “normal” aging showed a greater number of VENs compared 
to their cognitively average-for-their-age peers. Loss of VENs, on the other hand, has been observed in brains of patients suffering from a neurodegenerative disease called behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, as well as from several other neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and possibly Alzheimer’s disease. None of these studies, however, offered clues about VENs’ exact function or unique properties. Unraveling the mystery of these neurons can help find therapies for these disorders."

176038428,"Well obesity comes from eating too much. You must be eating a lot. Diet alone is sufficient to lose weight even without exercise. Judging by your weight, I imagine you are an endomorph, kinda like me. You need to up your fat intake to around 40% and lower carb intake to 25% and the rest 35% from protein. Endomorphs do not handle carbohydrates well, hence needing to up fat intake. This is from my nutrition course that I purchased from Precision Nutrition. It is a company that is used by many personal trainers for their nutritional information so it contains the most up to date research. However, given you are already obese I wonder if the high fat is good for you."

People who underwent starvation…they had a statistically higher rate of schizophrenia. It’s early days yet and we currently don’t have the knowledge to connect the pieces but it’s still the same old thing. Do what needs to be medically cool and move from there. The difference will be whether we see a spike in sz cases during this pandemic. That is what will describe our concerns but it may lead to better treatment for those prone to such things…

My pdr prescribed me an antidepressant Wellbutrin and then I couldn’t work at all, I couldn’t focus on work. Lack of concentration is a side effect of Wellbutrin. I think my pdr broke my working brain because we stopped Wellbutrin and I still fear work and can’t focus in tasks even at home.

One night I looked up at the constellation _NAME_ and ended up asking out loud “what’s this all for anyway.” I thought nothing of it but the next day i began seeing images on rocks. I know they contain visual information but are extremely complex and seemingly impossible to decipher. I have collected thousands thinking it was divine intervention that would provide me with an answer to my question but it has left me with more questions! I have since stopped collecting them but I still see the images on one whenever I take a look. The ones in my possession I need to return to the soil I suppose. I have had a lot of bad luck which I have endured. Have you received any more information from the ancients that you would not mind sharing?

176038501,"Well the thing is, you have no control over who you are going to be in there with. All these horror stories about dangerous patients or someone who bothers you because they don’t like you are real. People in general have aspects of their life experiences that are weird or make them dangerous. And to be locked up in a relatively small place while most of the people are going through some life crisis creates a lot of friction between parties. In the 7 or 8 different hospitals I was in, it was great when people tried to get along but in any large group you always have that faction who don’t care about getting along. But hell, I was a pretty naive 21 years old when I was in the hospital for 8 months. I tried to keep a low profile and there were a few people who liked me and I liked them, but the rest of the hundred people didn’t give a sh*t about me and I pissed off several people over trivial stuff and narrowly avoided getting really hurt."

Ironically, my physical illness saved my life. Although my body is losing muscle slowly, it made me know that my life is not just vain. However, I still have urges to hurt myself and you are so kind. Thank you so much. Losing touch makes me feel like everything is a dream. I’m also very delusional during that time, and I tend to believe that I’m not real. So in my blurred state, I call my dogs and my _NAME_ occasionally barks in return. He also likes to rub his fur on me and lick me. So it’s a blessing to have these dogs for sure. I’m juggling between physical and mental struggles, personally lol. Not sure if I have a plan, however. I’m only in for 3 years of my clinical MD so still learning about the physical part.

I mostly spend time waiting on a decent setup(I watch patterns mostly), but when it shows up, I’ll make like 1.5k to 3k in one day. It’s extremely satifisying and It got me past my negative symptoms for some part(yeah, they are kind of powerful).

176038584,I had these sorts of delusions. Sometimes I thought I was the antichrist and I kept seeing the numbers 666 and 616 everywhere. I remember my phone was full of screenshots of me happening upon those numbers. It was scary. The only thing that helped my delusions go away was meds. I tried therapy but I just ended up becoming more entrenched. The only other thing I’ve found that really helps is actively redirecting my thoughts to think logically before my emotions every have the chance to kick in. Just ignoring them results in an emotional hold.

176038601,How is that possible?
176038602,"AA completely changed me. Before AA, I wasn’t a criminal but I did break the law by buying and smoking crack with plenty of powder and alcohol almost every day including getting high and driving. I also might have picked up a hooker or two. I can only recall stealing twice. Once, me and two friends made a beer run. I was out the door fast but they caught my friend. And anyways, the 12-pack I was carrying ripped and all the beer just went rolling down the sidewalk and I didn’t get any of it. And I stole a car. But other than all that, I was a stellar citizen. Starting when I was about 16 I hated cops. All they wanted to do was wreck my fun. Never mind that my “fun” was mostly illegal, I still resented them. My whole addiction was about avoiding cops. But in 1990 I joined AA. I was 29 and I was at the point where I needed to stop wrecking my life with drugs and booze. I was in a temporary group home and unbeknownst to me, a small AA group took place once a week in the dining room. One night I 
wandered downstairs and discovered the meeting. I had been to meetings sporadically previously but I really never abstained from drugs. I was getting high in between. But It was the right place at the right time and I was invited to join and so I sat in. It was run by an older alcoholic who had quite a wild history of guns and alcohol and drugs and making drug runs from Mexico. Another guy I learned soon, said in every meeting, “I haven’t killed anyone—yet.” Don’t ask me why but it was actually kind of funny. And there were like 3 or 4 other people in the meeting and they were all very friendly and welcomed me. I think that if in these first meetings they had all been as*holes, it would have turned me off and I wouldn’t have stayed and I might have partied for another year or so. But they were cool, I still remember them. Anyways once I got clean I never touched drugs or alcohol again and I tried to live by the principles of AA. I tried to be honest, fair, responsible, positive etc. I worked the 1
2 steps and tried to incorporate those into my life too. And the funny thing was, that I stopped doing illegal things. And speaking for myself, I discovered the trick to getting along with cops. The big secret was drum roll: I stopped doing illegal things!! And with the help of AA for the following 30 years I didn’t have to looking over my shoulders all the time and fear cops. And they stopped hassling me. It’s all due to AA, CA and NA. Except for getting pulled over for maybe speeding occasionally or accidentally running a stop sign, with AA’s help I virtually stopped doing illegal things. So yeah, AA taught me a new way of life. And to sum up my life before getting clean and after getting clean, “When I was drinking and doing drugs I was part of the problem, now that I’m clean and sober I am part of the solution.” And it’s paid off in countless ways."

Anyways, we spoke on the phone for about 10 minutes and he put in for Invega just in case because the prior authorizations can take forever.

176038658,It’s a hard thing to say. I did poorly on it. Zyprexa seems great for me but we can all be so different. I’ve found it’s good sometimes to change. Other times it’s backfired. If you have a good doctor who keeps tabs on you it can work out well. If not it can leave you going backwards. Always a crap shoot. I’d say if function not so good now. Worth a shot at a change. The things you say have been reasons I’ve tried other ones before!

I’m not 100% on board with the disease model here, which I believe is very functional for many. I’m too intense to leave it at that, but I can be practical and say to myself “I’m less suicidal when I’m taking my Haldol as prescribed”, “life may be more boring and/or colorless, but I’ll get to see my kids grow up”…stuff like that. But, the gist is, I have to step outside the existential and find the boring sucky practical thing and do that.

176038780,_AT_MENTION_ it’s the lesser of 2 evils really. Off meds you become unstable and become a danger to yourself. This is the same as me. You need meds. What you’re wishing for is not to be ill at all. At some point I had to accept that I was ill and needed meds.

I know conventional success won’t take this pain away; I only desire success for the sake of helping my loved ones. I do love the people in my life but yeah, I’m not thrilled with my own existence. I think my best bet is learning to be content in misery. I’m being treated for depression but this distaste for life feels distinctly different from depression.

I’m not sure how much time it took to go away, I know it wasn’t instant. It did go away completely though. I was very fortunate. This was…around 15years ago. I’ve found that through trial and error you can get on the right combination of meds for you and live a fairly normal life. It took many years, and getting over stubbornness and fear to get hear, but I haven’t gotten sick enough to be hospitalized for 7years now taking my meds everyday.

174351670,"What to say to your voices: If they say they are demons etc, say there is no such thing (which there isn’t). Say “you have a syphilitic type infection”: Parent disease: Sexually transmitted infection Causes:Treponema pallidum adnauseum (latent neurosyphilis). State to your voices: - ""You don’t actually have syphilis per se, but an infection that closely resembles it. (et seq infra). Why don’t you read some _PERSON_, such as ‘On The Genealogy Of Morals’ or ‘Beyond Good & Evil’, and notice the similarity between your statements and questions (what you say), and mine!"" [Ideally, the best way to prove this is for you (the schizophrenic), to keep or record 1st person transcripts, quote unquote what gets said between you and your voices (AVH)]. My voices (AVH) can’t argue with this hypothesis. If I ever use ATS, my voices say they are making pornography (all Freemason talent). One of my voices (_PERSON_) says she gets a commission for organizing them. Sometimes, if I purchase pornog
raphic DVD’s, I see people I have met in them, just as they say. I don’t have prosopagnosia. This fact makes me want desperately to commit suicide. I was fertilized in a pornographic movie, and I hate it. I have seen the one, featuring my father, and two women, one is my mother. I do not approve, despite my behavior. This syphilitic type infection resembles the syphilis latent stage of infection. Syphilis type infections can spread to the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis). Having syphilis once does not protect you from getting it again. Even after you’ve been successfully treated, you can still be re-infected. It may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. This is because syphilis sores can be hidden in the vagina, anus, under the foreskin of the penis, or in the mouth. Unless you know that your sex partner(s) has been tested and treated, you may be at risk of getting syphilis again from an infected sex partner."

174351675,"In 2017-18 I was in a good place despite my illness. If you looked on my instagram I was going to art shows and hiking and attend support groups, I made new friends after years of being a loner due to illness, I started working and driving and listening to the radio… I had a good life. But right now after my second episode I still try to do the same things but I don’t seem to enjoy them as much. I feel like life would be better once I work or get back into a relationship but I feel like I have all I need right now to be happy. A few things still make me happy though like when I open up and bond with my friends and family. When I saw a little bit of The Green Book at the library and thought “that’s more of what I need.” I’m also happy I lost weight and am quite pretty right now. It is kind of a nice feeling to wear cute clothes to support group to show off a little lol, though I’m definitely not one who cares too much about such things. I’m kind of finding meaning in art and support 
group and hiking. And I take day treatment for granted but thinking about it, the program is really helping me grow again. I guess my silver lining right now is that I continue to see improvement and growth in my life and I don’t feel like life is moving backwards or stopped in it’s tracks. I hope I can adjust to my decreased functioning level since my second episode and still find happiness. I feel like once we’ve gotten used to being schizophrenic it’s really easy to see that there is a silver lining there. Have you found that good place in your recovery?"

176038826,"Abstract Objective To determine whether gender differences in symptom presentation at first episode psychosis (FEP) remain even when controlling for substance use, age and ethnicity, using natural language processing applied to electronic health records (EHRs). Design, setting and participants Data were extracted from EHRs of 3350 people (62% male patients) who had presented to the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust with a FEP between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2017. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in the presentation of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms. Exposure(s) (for observational studies) Gender (male vs female). Main outcome(s) and measure(s) Presence of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms at initial clinical presentation. Results Eight symptoms were significantly more prevalent in men (poverty of thought, negative symptoms, social withdrawal, poverty of speech, aggression, grandiosity, paranoia and ag
itation). Conversely, tearfulness, low energy, reduced appetite, low mood, pressured speech, mood instability, flight of ideas, guilt, mutism, insomnia, poor concentration, tangentiality and elation were more prevalent in women than men. Negative symptoms were more common among men (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.62) and depressive and manic symptoms more common among women (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.35). After adjustment for illicit substance use, the strength of associations between gender and negative, manic and depression symptoms increased, whereas gender differences in aggression, agitation, paranoia and grandiosity became insignificant. Conclusions There are clear gender differences in the clinical presentation of FEP. Our findings suggest that gender can have a substantial influence on the nature of clinical presentation in people with psychosis, and that this is only partly explained by exposure to illicit substance use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/4/e042949"

176038874,"I’ve been there. I have battled PTSD since I was 17 so 7 years now. I am a hardcore advocate of treatment. If you really dig in in therapy and do self work as well you can make HUGE progress. And the thing with PTSD treatment is it’s super super hard and you may feel like it’s not beneficial because it will set you off very very badly at first and you’ll feel set back by a mile. But you will notice over time that you are set back less and less and things that triggered you really bad now only trigger you a little and then sometimes they don’t trigger you all. You’ll find you go from thinking about your trauma constantly to only sometimes and then suddenly realize you’ve gone months barely thinking about it and feel like you dont even have PTSD. That’s the difference good treatment can make. However even if you have the best treatment PTSD is still a lifelong disorder and I still get my flare ups from time to time. But I know when they will happen and what causes them so I am prepare
d, and I know that the flare up will pass, that’s the best thing you can do is remind yourself the flare up will pass.

The improvement was dramatic. He turned into an outgoing, happy person. One thing though, he had aspirations to write that were misplaced. When I read some of the things he’d written they were barely coherent, if coherent at all. I’m wondering if the ECT did that to him.

So now my follow up appointment is tomorrow and I am unsure of what to say or ask for. My depression is just as bad as it was during my last appointment. My last appointment I went back on medication for the first time in a few months. We went back to Geodon 40 am and 40 pm with the plan to move up to 80 in the pm if I was handling the dosing well. So after a week I moved up to 40mg in the am and 80 mg in the pm. I am still dealing with voices and shadow hallucinations but things have gotten calmer. But my depression is off the charts bad right now, I’m very suicidal but I’m afraid to tell anyone because I really am trying to avoid the hospital at the moment. I really can’t afford to lose out on any more work days. I’m suicidal but I have no intent on acting out on my fantasies if that makes any sort of sense? S

Ever since my life would never be the same… Later in April 2007, I saw another word “Menace”, then in late May I started seeing people and more words and it’s been that way every since. I believe I’ve been spiritually possessed. Anyway, I’m a Christian that believe in prayer, but that’s where it gets difficult. The spirit possessor showed me negative words every day since 2007, but now the words became negative prayers (Ever since late 2009)!

174351722,"Mental health is strongest taboo, says research This article is more than 11 years old Coming out as being gay is easier than admitting to a mental health condition, study shows _NAME_ 20 Feb 2009 06.17 EST 21 People are more reluctant to reveal they have a mental illness than to come out as gay, according to a new study that reaffirms warnings from campaigners that mental illness still faces a persistent social taboo. In a survey of 2,000 people across Britain, almost 30% said they would find it difficult to admit publicly to having a mental illness, compared with 20% who said they would have difficulty coming out as gay. Commissioned by the Time to Change campaign, an umbrella group of charities and the Institute of Psychiatry with a remit to challenge _USER_ID_, the survey also found that admitting to a mental health condition was deemed harder than confessing to having a drink problem or going bankrupt. Almost a third of respondents believed someone with a mental health problem couldn’t do a 
responsible job. Advertisement “Perhaps it’s no surprise that a separate study found fewer than four in 10 employers would feel able to employ someone with a mental health problem,” the study’s authors say. “The figures paint a bleak picture that reflects a Britain where mental health problems can stop you getting a job, having social interaction and getting on with life because they are so stigmatised.” The study suggests that the impact of _USER_ID_ extends well beyond the boardroom and shop floor. People are four times more likely to break off a romantic relationship if their partner is diagnosed with severe depression than if they develop a physical disability. Those with schizophrenia are particularly likely to face problems: 20% of women said they would break up with a partner who was diagnosed with the condition. _NAME_, who has had depression and is an advocate for the Time to Change campaign, says the public needs to be made aware of the extent of discrimination against people with mental 
health problems. “I’m Asian, I’m gay, and I have faced discrimination – but not for the reasons most people think,” he says. ""It was actually when I got depression that I faced most discrimination. “I think it’s fantastic we have come so far as a society – in many ways, become less discriminatory – but we have a long way to go on mental health. For me, it’s been the biggest taboo.” The Time to Change campaign, launched last year with £16m from the Big Lottery Fund and £2m from Comic Relief, aims to reduce by 5% the discrimination directed towards people with mental health problems by 2012."

A population-based cohort study in Sweden. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of psychiatric research , May 27 2019 The objective of the present study was to examine if the monthly variation in births of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia currently differs from that of unaffected individuals in Sweden. In an extensive linkage of Swedish national and regional population registers we here investigate the birth pattern of the population born 1940-97 (5,995,499 individuals) which included 30,684 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in the National Patient Register by December 31, 2016. Among 2,409,862 individuals born since 1973 we investigated potential confounding by co-variates associated with pregnancy and birth. We also compared the monthly birth pattern of 22,570 affected individuals to that of their 41,528 unaffected full siblings. We observe a significant birth excess of individuals with schiz
ophrenia in December, HR 1.07 95%CI (1.01-1.13). Patients born in December received a registered diagnosis of schizophrenia at a slightly younger age than those born during other months. A number of co-variates were associated not only with schizophrenia but also varied across birth months. Inclusion of these in the models however had virtually no influence on the risk for schizophrenia associated with December birth. In comparisons between full siblings, the association between December birth and later diagnosis of schizophrenia remained, albeit slightly attenuated, HR 1.06 (0.99-1.12). Risk for schizophrenia associated with birth in December in Sweden during the study period does not appear to be fully explained by our investigated co-variates or factors shared between family members and may thus represent monthly/seasonal variation in environmental factors involved in the etiology of schizophrenia."

All I know is if left without support I’d struggle to maintain a healthy independence . A group home would be a possibility. By the first definition I’m severely disabled . As to whether I’m at the severe end of schizoaffective- then no. Does the additional factor of _PERSON_’s change that? I don’t know."

One man’s trash is another man’s treasure I guess. I came of meds once because I saw on youtube that megadosing with niacin was a good substitute for meds. I got what I deserved and ended up psychotic in hospital.

My brother is a victim of schizoaffective disorder and has extreme anhedonia as some will call it- that includes, but is not limited to a lack of pleasure, interest and enjoyment in normal activities. He also has poor memory and concentration. He believes strongly that this was caused by a drug named safforas that he took a while back. He’s tried antipsychotics to treat these side effects, but got no luck. He heard that sarcosine helps people with some of these symptoms, but before he tries it he wants to know if anyone has had any luck treating the side effects mentioned above. Specifically if they are someone who believes the side effects were caused by the anti-psychotics and not the illness. He currently takes zyprexa & vistaril."

176039168,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, I know you’re having a tough time and feel for you and get what you’re going through to some extent cuz I’ve been there but I think it’s been harder to walk in your shoes than in mine. I tried doing a lot of research myself but I realized I’m in over my head because I lack the specialized PhD level training necessary to have even a beginner’s understanding of how meds work. What worked for me was a 3 principles program. 1) lots of sleep 2) take my meds (a simple mix, not a complex cocktail) and 3) insight & faith that things might improve over time (and they did). By insight I mean I always tried to understand what was going on but accepted what was and didn’t deny it. I think you have a good future ahead of you and you can get ahead of this. You are very high IQ. Sometimes bringing that under control can be the biggest challenge. I and everyone else on here is wishing the best for you. Keep trying."

176039170,"I have trouble believing in a conscious afterlife. I’d like to think once my body perishes I’ll be part of the universe again. On a molecular level I find it feasible to some extent considering the world itself will someday cease to exist in any relational way. The planet is massive enough to imagine that there would be some remnant debris floating in space. I’d like to think we are something like that here. Anyway, I want to believe in a conscious afterlife where there is only good, something like the notion of Heaven. I can’t imagine what it’d be like. I do believe in some form of a higher power (not to get too religious) and if I can’t comprehend why celestial bodies (i.e. planets in solar systems) began to spin then I can’t begin to comprehend what a higher power might be like. I feel it is not my place personally to question such things. Anyway, I’d like to believe I’ll see my grandparents again someday as well as everyone I’ve loved in life. I somehow doubt it. Spiritually

If I don’t have anxiety it does nothing for me but if I have an anxiety attack I take one and in 10 minutes I am okay. I used to have crippling paranoia. Xanax was a miracle drug for me. No paranoid schizophrenic should have to go without it. Unfortunately it took me a few years to figure that out. The first four years I was sick were a ????? without it.

176039193,"I have managed to cut: Levomepromazine 50mg at night - I can sleep 6-7 hours now without it! It was making me so rotten in the mornings Procyclidine 25mg per day - I now take none and no movement problems. Very happy as one less pill! Diazepam down from 30mg last year to 10mg per day now prescribed, cut to 5mg every 2 days. My anxiety has not gotten worse as was just taking it for dependancy and it does nothing for me. Paracetamol seems to get rid of the headaches etc Aripiprazole 5mg - was taking for reducing Prolactin, but as _AT_MENTION_ posted before this does not work with Amisulpride, confirmed by recent blood test, so stopped that cold turkey. Feel fine from that one as it was such a low dose. Sertraline 50mg - quit that on advice from pdoc and had horrible withdrawals, but a few packs of paracetamol helped me get through this. Refused Mitrapazine 30mg, and the Depression - which I think was situational (I’m pretty sensitive) - has not come back Pregabalin 300mg - I came off this for three 
days and I woke up feeling like my body was on fire. Now I am back on this dose, but have been given 75mg caps, so hope in a few weeks to reduce this - but much slower. Amisulpride 800mg I am not touching, as psychosis would ruin my career and I would lose my drivers license. Statin 20mg - sticking to this as don’t want to clog up! This is where I am at with it. Honestly, pdoc left me on all these meds with little monitoring. Before my old pdoc retired I was on Amisulpride 800mg and 30mg a day of Diazepam. When these new docs took over, they put me on a lot of meds, and I was very unhappy about this I am testing my resolve, sometimes sensibly, sometimes not so much. But I am not rattling as much now. Hope to be of Diazepam soon, as that drug I have been dependent on for years and have tolerance to my dose, so it’s pretty much ineffective. Sorry to those who think messing with meds is wrong, but I am sticking to what my old pdoc used to tell me. Be on as little meds as you can, but always remember when cha
nging things that the AP is the doctor decision not mine. I will continue to follow that advice from a doctor I knew since I was 16 years old and he helped me through my first psychosis and the trouble I was in with the law and druggies. My body will recover from these things. Hoping they will review the depression and anxiety dx’s, as I say, I think it was more a natural reaction to normal things going on in my life. Will keep in touch with services in case I am wrong. I hope this time next year I will only be an Autistic Paranoid Schizophrenic and not a depressed and anxious person as well"

I found when I tried to make the voices go away, they got louder and meaner. If I instead just ignored them or said “I won’t do that”, nothing happened. I’ve had a lot of therapy to learn to deal with my voices and understand them. I am no longer scared of them or desperate to have them go away. The mean voices have gotten milder as therapy has dug into why they’re there and what part of me they represent."

Good people don’t have a “get out of jail free card” that’s going to stop a bullet from hitting them or that will keep them financially secure. It ain’t all black & white though.

I’m not sure if I should continue taking it. I don’t know what’s normal for Keflex. I know antibiotics are really rough on the digestive system in general so I guess I’ll just keep taking it until further notice. It is already helping my toe so I really want to keep taking it.

Don’t get too far ahead of yourself but take the opportunities as you see them! You’ll get there because your so proactive in your health and that is great!
174351806,"It’s described here as - In people with schizophrenia, asociality is currently defined as a reduction in social initiative due to decreased interest in forming close relationships with others. It should not be defined in purely behavioural terms (i.e., whether the subject has or not social interactions and close relationships), but mainly as a reduction in motivation for social contacts (i.e., whether the subject values and desires social interactions and close social bonds) 46 , 50 . For me it’s probably the most pronounced negative symptom , but being on the autism spectrum is an additional factor when it comes to being asocial ."

174351800,"Highest dose is 30. I took it for a couple of years, it made me more social but I eventually developped serious side effects like gambling issues (Lost 80 000$ in bitcoins), drug addiction, hypersexuality (I would waste my money on multiple hookers in a single day) and compulsive shopping (Bought useless expensive stuff that I later threw in the trash) I was in big debt and my parents paid my debts. Without them I would be in prison or dead. Also Abilify increases drug pleasure and addiction, I was hooked up on weed and I started hanging out with bad friends that were trying to push me into cocaine. Weed made my psychosis worse and more aggressive. I stopped having these issues when I switched to Latuda. My psychiatrist said these are side effects that some people experience from Abilify. I would rather be less social than dying from drugs, STDs and debts. I left all my friends and I only go out for my psychiatrist apt. My parents gets my meds and food."

I looked around me To see if he had gone Praying to see nothing Wishing I could make him Nothing Non-existent Just a figment Of my ever growing Brain fog. But I opened my eyes And peering over My right shoulder I could see that sarcastic smile If I was stronger I would have slapped That sinister grin Right off that evil face I can’t even begin to tell How deeply he bruised My soul And cowered at the thought Of his sickening hands Touching me His putrid breath Smelling like he’d consumed A dead carcass I often wondered if he was A man Or a demon sent To haunt me To make words Entering my brain and Spewing out of my mouth Like torture Vomiting out of me Seeping through the cracks And pooling on the concrete I wanted to be rid of him But my weakness Had become my enemy.

It’s very draining to keep it up and this sort of thing tends to peak during the day, and I get some peace in the evening if I have done stuff all day like work etc that has made me tired enough for this to subside. If I am focused on a task this really works well to distract me. Quick to judge also as my mind never has that extra capacity to sit on unresolved issues. I like clarity and certainty. Things left over weekends sends my anxiety through the roof. I hate weekends as there is little support as mental health here is 9 to 5, or 7 to 7 in a crisis"

I think trying to treat positive symptoms without meds just makes them worse. Users here who say therapy helps them got better from the meds and not from therapy, remove their meds and everything falls down into delusions regardless of therapy."

176039375,"Whatever you’re weaving here on this site is an unmeasured response. And you “hit the nail on the head”, you seem to be a.creep. And I don’t use that word on people too often. And its not vanity that I engage, it’s not even a sick fascination, it’s just that I dislike hypocrisy and people having it both ways. That’s why I like the written word. If you’re angry at life (or my schtick) maybe just spit it out already. I’m actually really malleable. But let’s face it, for you… some people in this world are so caught up in power and control that the mere consideration of ‘DOING VERBS’, has left the building. (As in with me; when I got the silent treatment and was ultimately told there was nothing I did to necessitate forgiving, after already “giving in” and explicitly asking for it). (This is all how I really think now and I had a ton of help reaching this juncture; this observation of ‘Man’.) It manifests in your posts because they are all ‘ART’ and not for the pur
pose of spurring dialog; but simply to be a total nuisance, mentally. And I have every right, bc I don’t know if one day ‘’Man’ will cross boundaries into the physical with me. I’ve had that string tugged before. So that’s my current esteem; but hey ‘THIS IS US’ at the end of the day, isn’t it? Whatever; history doesn’t help me think my way out of this darkness. A greater challenge for you might be to actually make me feel ‘alright.’ It’s a bigger mountain to move; more potential to explore being effective at something. I mean, it can’t be so satisfying to shoot ducks in barrels right? Maybe wake up; and I’d take that to myself, but apparently all I know is mistakes so I’m actually afraid of that TOO. Thanks."

174351830,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov A Systematic Review of The Potential Use of Neurofeedback in Patients with Schizophrenia. V Gandara, JA Pineda, _PERSON_ and F _PERSON_, Schizophrenia bulletin, Mar 2020 02 Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (anhedonia, social withdrawal) and marked cognitive deficits (memory, executive function, and attention). Current mainstays of treatment, including medications and psychotherapy, do not adequately address cognitive symptoms, which are essential for everyday functioning. However, recent advances in computational neurobiology have rekindled interest in neurofeedback (NF), a form of self-regulation or neuromodulation, in potentially alleviating cognitive symptoms in patients with SCZ. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature for NF studies in SCZ to identify lessons learned and to identify steps to move the field forward. Our findings reveal that NF studies t
o date consist mostly of case studies and small sample, single-group studies. Despite few randomized clinical trials, the results suggest that NF is feasible and that it leads to measurable changes in brain function. These findings indicate early proof-of-concept data that needs to be followed up by larger, randomized clinical trials, testing the efficacy of NF compared to well thought out placebos. We hope that such an undertaking by the field will lead to innovative solutions that address refractory symptoms and improve everyday functioning in patients with SCZ."

176039430,Meds are a curious concern but so are symptoms and side effects. The rule of thumb is you take the minimum dose that takes care of your symptoms whilst trying to avoid the side effects. Many meds are pyramidal. The more you take the more side effects. I don’t think it’s bad policy in your case. Siezures are scary as hell but the reality is that some of the meds we take can lower the threshold. Still. How are your symptoms?

Its not like paralysis where even if we try we can’t function instead it appears like mental paralysis but if we force ourselves to function normally then we can do it like regular individuals. There are individuals with ADHD and other learning disabilities still function normally.

176039492,"Maybe I’m looking for any excuse to come off the risperdal _AT_MENTION_ These twitches don’t happen very often but it’s affecting my face and yes this is concerning. Risperdal is well known to cause facial tics and it could also be tardive dyskenesia, you never know."
176039493,_PERSON_ I am sure of that too. Catatonia is a sign of severe brain chemical imbalance and maybe damage.

176039497,Welcome to the forum too _AT_MENTION_
176039498,I was on the injection. It helped with paranoia and delusions. But I felt terrible on it. The only thing I wanted to do was go out and smoke on it.
174351853,"I’ve been on Zyprexa for 12 weeks now, and it’s been my miracle drug. My lowest effective dose is 7.5 mg and that is what I’m on now for the past month. Zyprexa totally controls my positive symptoms. Prior to Zyprexa, I had disabling paranoia and delusions, and I was getting breakthrough voices even on 30 mg of Haldol. No breakthrough symptoms on Zyprexa. I have been calorie counting to avoid weight gain - in fact, I’ve lost 11 pounds so far. It also gives me insomnia, so I take it in the morning and I’m alert all day rather than being zombified on Haldol. I am doing worlds better on it - I feel like a normie. I am in the process of registering to volunteer with a local hospice until I find a full-time accounting clerk job. I just bought a new-to-me car so I have my independence back and I can get myself around without waiting for my husband to get off from work. When I find a full-time job, I will be off disability that I’ve been on for the past four a half years. I don’t feel like I
’m being watched or followed anymore, so I can go out on my own. This is HUGE for me. I’m getting my life back, and it’s thanks to Zyprexa! I hope it works for you as well as it does for me!"
174351859,What is good at it?
176039499,"Best wishes to you, I hope it does help."
176039500,At age 13 I had a major autistic meltdown and my relatives (not parents) were going to call the police but I begged them not to I wasn’t psychotic but I was out of control Also I wish that someone had realized my fears/delusions earlier but i never told anyone so they didn’t find out even though it was distressing to me
174351860,I feel like I’m misdiagnosed too. I have (according to them) chronic paranoid schizophrenia. But personally I think schizophrenia is a made up illness for people being targeted so they lose their credibility if they talk about the government
176039501,Wow. Very nice !!! I like the colors.
176039502,In IOP in 2013 over 6 years ago I ran into a girl from my high school who talked about some famous mirror in New York that you look into and you see the “true you”. Like no other mirror in the world shows the “true you” except this mirror. But the group therapist found it an offensive idea for some reason and ended the discussion on this mirror. But I still think about it. Is the true me less or more or equal attractive/whatever to what I really think. I’m not sure. I’ll never know probably.
176039503,I hope it works out
176039504,"So basically you want a nicer place to live, without a roommate? Which is totally understandable. But you are going to have to get really serious about paying your bills. None of this “nothing happened last time I didn’t pay them” crap. You have to pay the bills first each month. Rent, electric, gas, water/sewer, garbage. Then you have to make sure you have enough food in the house and household needs like soap. Then you need to setback some for emergencies. Then what’s leftover is what you can spend on takeaway and whatnot. It’s going to be hard. You know what I do? I get a pen and paper and write out each expense rent 600 electric 75 water 40 etc. then I list all my credit cards and total everything up and minus that out of my monthly amount, whatever is leftover is how much I have left to play with. It usually goes to extra on credit cards for me. But you can do that now as a practice to learn how to be better with money. It will help you keep track of what needs to get paid and basica
lly how much things will cost. If you aren’t sure how much a utility will be you can contact the utility company and ask how much it typically costs for your budget."
176039505,"Fair point. I don’t care about my own life, but I do care for my family’s safety."
176039506,My in laws were saying nice things and have said I’ve made improvements but i mess up a lot too and that’s all they focused on. My partner told me to do what I want today watch animal documentary or anime on crunchyroll. But I cleaned out the fridge . My inlaws dont know I lm getting a med increase. They wont care my partner talked to the doctor since I don’t have a case manager anymore she made my partner promise to call her nurses line or if emergency the hospital if I take an extreme downward spiral
176039507,I had these punk friends in high school who vandalized alot of stuff. I went with them sometimes and unfortunately did some damage myself. Usually after the beer ran out they would go out and vandalize. I didn’t have the forsight or better judgement or empathy that I do now and would never do this as an adult. I’m ashamed of it now. They eventually got arrested for doing $20000 damage to buildings one night. It still comes up if you google their names. I wonder how it is for them to get jobs. There’s a right to be forgotten law in Europe that precludes stuff like this. I think I believe in this as they were only 17 when it happened.
176039508,I think this has alot to do with not knowing where the boundaries are in a relationship and crossing over certain boundaries and getting hurt
176039509,Cleaning them ain’t.
176039510,They don’t but they block dopamine which causes these.
176039511,How long have you been taking the medication?
176039512,Dreamed last nite mine all night.
176039513,It’s a near constant feeling. I either think I’m going to have some freak accident or I’m going to die or have a heart attack. It’s really annoying.
176039514,I get mine through my doctor. I don’t know if otc would be the same. Might want to ask first.
176039515,"Remember being on the bus on the way to the airport, the voices came back at a low tone I thought why are they so hard to hear"
176039516,That would be so awesome. Across the street from where I used to work these black guys owned a hot dog and sandwich shop. You could get two dogs for $2.50 or something. It was so fun going there bc there was just a bunch of guys sitting around just joking and laughing and the dude that owned the place just would laugh just to be laughing. I loved going over there

176039521,"Hmm I will _AT_MENTION_ , it might just stop these whispers even without a med increase it’s possible"
174351851,Caffeine worsens psychosis for me. I cant tolerate it.
176039522,"Same, I zone out when trying to focus on something to say in a conversation or I just have a blank mind most of the time. Probably due to my meds."
174351857,Both 5mg and 10mg worsen my paranoia DTR. Im stable on clozapine but after relapse abilify started giving me paranoia. Before relapse i could only tolerate upto 10mg abilify. On 15mg i slept whole day. On 10mg i still had paranoia and delusions. So pdoc stopped abilify and shifted me to clozapine and since then life has been good. Its been 6 years on clozapine.
176039523,"my one pdoc knew their patients by what meds they were on and not their name, he said I was an exception because I had a cool last name lol, and I called him all the time"
176039524,"_AT_MENTION_ , I don’t accept it because my problems with sz used to not take over my life as much and it got really bad, the past couple of months, then it got better, but all the medication is sedating and sucks the life and emotions out of me especially when I try to be in social settings with my boyfriend. He says the meds made me worse. I cant see it, but he always used to be my insight when thinks got rocky, and I used to listen to him then my problems were gone. He always says “ever since you got on that shot you got nasty, I’m going to end up leaving you, then you’ll be on the streets. Youre turning into the girlfriend I never wanted, like all my past girlfriends. You used to be different and cool to hang around with.” With that weighing on me all the time, I want to be med free. _AT_MENTION_ I didn’t realize there are 3 phases, I must be a slow progresser cause I was a lot better 10 years ago when I first went on meds. It’s a major letdown thinking I didn’t get better and n
eed to still depend on medication. That stuff is going to end up killing me. I’m afraid to get my blood tests done. _AT_MENTION_ I guess this is as stable I am going to get, its just the flat feeling that kills me, I want to be full of life. Yesterday I drank a cup of tea, starbucks energy drink, and two mountain dew kickstarts. I shouldn’t be relying on caffeine that much to feel a buzz. I even smoked some nicotine vape so I can perceive world in a better set of eye. My psychiatrist, and my whole treatment team will only suggest injections. I’ve weighed my options for injections, and Invega is the only thing that is semi-decent. I don’t think I hear voices anymore, but I would rather be a little unstable on just the oral fluphenazine, lose weight, and not feel so weighed down. Besides I just say my pdoc Thursday, and she didn’t say anything about a med change. It just takes social situations like yesterday to get me really thinking how lost and different I am from others in this world, and if sz ta
kes over me… who cares? I am not capable of having a job or volunteering, so things cant get worse, can it?"
176039525,"Listen, it’s excellent that you have so much going on. It’s excellent that you’re writing it down and making a schedule. But what’s best of all is that your happy about all these things you’re doing, that’s really great."

174351858,"Some nutrients are difficult to get from food. In the case of iron, spinach has a lot less than most people think, and it’s difficult to absorb. So if your iron levels are already normal it’s fine, but if you are deficient, eating spinach isn’t going to do it. Supplements don’t always have what they say in them though. Which is why I’m growing the sprouts. But it’s a fair amount of work."

To find meaning, you need to find a purpose. Some challenge you are interested in. I was a programmer before my sz started so i was heavily involved in logic. When I had to quit the job because of my problem, I felt life had no meaning or purpose. But I noticed I liked seeing art on the internet. So I started learning apps that let you make art on the computer. I’m still learning but along with my logic side, I have improved my creative side. If you have trouble finding a purpose, look at the things that interest you and see how you can improve at doing them. You seem to have some interest in this forum so think about getting more involved here if you cant think of any other interests."

176039542,"I’ve realised that over the years his behaviour was toxic because he spoke of people in negative and critical way if they didn’t meet his high standards. For example he’d say the men don’t pray properly, and he made negative comments about our next door neighbour who turned out to be so kind yesterday in our crisis. My husband is very argumentative and sometimes belligerent with me and with others. Called his brothers in law bad names to me. And … he’s just so negative! It’s depressing. He’s got his good points too - he’s fair, gentle, soft and loving and loyal, but he just …he’s so negative! and it made my mental illness worse. I think if I leave him and get surrounded by positive people, I may go into remission again - maybe…"

174351865,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effectiveness of Electroacupuncture and Electroconvulsive Therapy as Additional Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Schizophrenia: A Retrospective Controlled Study. _PERSON_ Jia, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychology , 2019 Electroacupuncture (EA) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are often used in the management of schizophrenia. This study sought to determine whether additional EA and ECT could augment antipsychotic response and reduce related side effects. In this retrospective controlled study, 287 hospitalized schizophrenic patients who received antipsychotics (controls, n = 50) alone or combined with EA (n = 101), ECT (n = 55) or both (EA + ECT, n = 81) were identified. EA and ECT were conducted for 5 and 3 sessions per week, respectively, with a maximum of 12 sessions for ECT during hospitalization. The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and Scale for the Assessment of Negati
ve Symptoms (SANS) were used to assess the severity of psychotic symptoms. Clinical response on SAPS and SANS, weight gain, and adverse events were compared. Survival analysis revealed that the ECT and EA + ECT groups had markedly greater clinical response rate than controls on SAPS [72.7 and 90.1% vs. 64.0%; relative risk (RR), 1.974 and 2.628, respectively, P ? 0.004] and on SANS (67.3 and 70.4% vs. 42.0%; RR, 1.951 and 2.009, respectively, P ? 0.015). A significantly greater response rate on SANS than controls was also observed in the EA group (64.4% vs. 42.0%; RR = 1.938, P = 0.008). EA-containing regimens remarkably reduced weight gain and incidences of headache, insomnia, dry mouth, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. These results suggest that EA and ECT can serve as additional treatment for enhancing antipsychotic response and reduce the side effects in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia.

176039590,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ ! These are typical paranoid thoughts. I had these. (I’m diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia). They eventually went away when I got on abilify. They didn’t go away overnight though. Have you been diagnosed offically with anything?
176039591,Pulse reading is simple.

174351869,Yes _AT_MENTION_ I’m sure you’re right I just have to try it and see how it is for me! I will probably keep olanzapine to hand for PRN if things go off the rails as it’s a very effective anti-manic in addition to being an AP. They recommend against being on multiple APs at once here but an exception is made when titrating from one to the other.

176039618,My mother really pissed me off today.
176039619,I’ve sold the phone to second hand shop. I’m getting samsung phone. It may not be a problem for some people but I need my music without distractions.
176039620,There is nothing embarrassing about your posts.
176039621,It used to be that anything challenging scared me but now I find little challenges exciting. I have a tendency to overdo so I’m just afraid I might push myself over my limit again. Why am I such a difficult child to myself?
176039622,"It was the end of a long day and I went out for mexican and margaritas with my boyfriend and his mom. I had 2 normal size margaritas not even huge ones or anything. By the time we got home, I had trouble breathing, especially when I was laying down. I just felt out of breath and was very labored my boyfriend said it sounded like my nose was stuffed bc I was breathing loudly through my mouth but I was just trying to take in as much air as possible. It was much easier to breathe sitting up. This spell lasted for probably 30 minutes. I have no idea what it was and we were nervous and he was even considering taking me to the ER. I am scared something is wrong with my heart…I have been having so many issues lately that I have been brushing off…I have greatly reduced my caffeine intake and that has helped a lot but I fear maybe some damage has been done or something. I’m gonna cut back on drinking even more as well. Anyways I’m going to tell my doctor of course I just needed to share somewhere be
cause it was scary. summary : Had literally 2 margaritas and had an episode of shortness of breath and just finding it hard to breathe for 30 mins or so. Worried about it bc of my heart issues lately. Gonna tell a doctor just wanted to share here to get it off my mind."
176039623,Most people handle stress way better than me though I’m just shutting down and dying. I do some meditative breathing when I’m really anxious but what’s squared breathing?
176039624,Yes antipsychotics could be the culprit. Make sure you contact your doctor first thing in the morning.
176039625,Have you actually read what you have written since the beginning post? You change the story on every post?

176039629,Giving this a bump because I care about _PERSON_ too. _AT_MENTION_ Sounds like you’re off to a good start with the loxapine if you’re feeling okay again. Hope you get the increase ASAP!

174351890,I just don´t like this paranoia. I should be “positve free” from 15mg abilify. I don´t want to think that the med isn´t working or that I´m going through the same ???? again. I plan to talk to my doc. Tomorrow I´ll set a date with him.

176039640,How are you feeling today _AT_MENTION_?
176039641,Maybe listen to high volume music when feeling bad? I do that and it helps.

If Clozapine doesn’t work, I think I’ll cut out APs for a couple of months. Let my head rest and see what happens. Obviously I’ll talk to my pdoc first. Wish me luck. Much love."
176039650,Yeah it’s brand name is Zoloft. I have nothing to compare it against but I don’t want the same hassle I had finding an AP that worked for me

176039653,Who do I talk to? The Police -The family -A Priest -_PERSON_ Top 0 voters
176039654,Thanks for your answer. I do like my current therapist. She seems experienced in dealing with people like me who are perhaps a bit hesitant to verbalize things. I trust her to help come up with the best solution for me. I’m so eager to start feeling better.
176039655,"Is it a belief,?"
176039656,"I mean, who really knows why any of us have it. But I do believe mine started because of abuse when I was a kid."
174351897,I had soup with nothin in it just basically chicken broth and I threw it up. All I can hold down is ice tea and water
176039657,I know exactly what you went through. I hate these extended family gatherings.
176039658,"Look if you think they’re real, then thats just harder on you. Its probably a delusion that is reinforced by the stimulus of w/e you hear. Please tell her to support you, and that its not helpful to just reaffirm that its not real."

Let’s see if I can control weight with this
176039668,I don’t think it’s an instant disqualifier. I know truckers who have adhd and take meds for that.
176039669,"If it is working I wouldn’t risk changing it to something that doesn’t work as well… Unless the side effects are severe enough to warrant it… Also, sometimes a med that didn’t work so well in the past can work well in the future… you never know."

I’m also on Latuda but I know it doesn’t cause my insomnia because I had this insomnia problem before I was on Latuda. It’s hard to deal with all those problems, never mind with a lack a of sleep. I hope you get some sleep soon. Ask them about a “Hypnotic” like Lunesta or Ambien or “Benzo” like lorazepam for sleep if it gets really bad."

If you are born in a country with a brutal dictator then your life will not be the same as someone born into some industrialized nation with a good political system. It ain’t even that cut and dried though. The quality of life has improved in so many areas in the world. Diseases like polio, the plague and chicken pox were killing significant numbers of people through the ages until they were largely eradicated in most areas.

So once you have a crop from a batch of seeds and it doesn’t make you sick, future crops grown from that package of seeds are probably going to be safe.

176039770,"Fast food is a rip-off these days. I remember when I was 8 years old I had to walk three miles to school in snow piled 4 feet high. Sorry, I got distracted. When I was a kid, we could go to _NAME_-in-the-Box and get a hamburger for 29 cents and about 30 cents for fries and a tall milkshake for 90 cents or something. Even well into high school I remember going to McDonalds and getting a meal and driving away feeling that we got a good deal. I haven’t felt that way about fast food for years. I dropped $18.00 for one meal at Taco Bell the other night. It more than filled me up but I still felt it was rediculously overpriced. Tonight, I stopped by _NAME_’s and got some chicken sandwich combo meal. $14.00. Totally not worth it. A dry chicken sandwich that was nothing special, small fries and a diet Pepsi. I don’t even know why I bother with these places anymore. And McDonalds is about the same."

History and anthropology also attracted me, but i had no clue what i was going to be then…since there are hardly jobs in those fields."
176039774,"Thank you for your support. I know that a lot of you have commented on the physical health thread. I can’t get to them right now. I’m in a state of shock and it will take me a while to get back to you. I feel like I don’t exist. Or at least not for myself. I feel invalidated and manipulated. I feel like I am trash. I am shutting down my emotions and going to supress them for the sake of my family’s rules. I will purposely use flat effect as much as I can to supress sadness and anger down. Please know that I still love you all. My mom hates me when I cry so I don’t cry. This is the rule in my house for me to obey. I’m still here, by the way. I’m going to be very flat but not because of sz. But on purpose. It’ll take some time to cool down. Talk to you soon. Either these emotions kill me, or my dilated cardiomyopathy kill me, or I survive. It depends on me and I must choose one of the three. Thanks."

174351945,"Yes, all the time. I keep a recovery journal. It’s a log of what I’m experiencing with my schizophrenia. What symptoms I have, how I rate them in terms of severity, how I’m doing overall, what specific things I’m doing, what things I’m having trouble doing, what my meds are, what problems I’m having with the meds, how the meds are helping, who my current medical team is, how they’re working for me, what they’ve asked/told me to do, what my goals are, etc. It’s a valuable resource to have to go back to. I’ve been involved in several research projects and every single one of them was very excited to have access to these journals."

And I did fail. I failed several times and it’s expensive taking lessons etc It’s difficult in Sweden to get license compared to Australia. I got my license in Australia and it’s one of the best things to ever happen to me. Proved those cruel voices to be wrong.

I failed alot but never gave up and found a way of thinking that worked for me. If indeed I suceed as becoming a doctor I am writing a book on how I accomplished this and tackled my sz. Its going to be a book full of suggestions and tips for getting healthy again. And at no point for a period of years was I able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, all hallucination puns aside lol, but I kept at it and eventually found a way.

176039848,I used to work on a antipsychotic when I was young in a job that was more laborious than thinking. For a few years I did a VISTA volunteer job that required more thinking. than labor. However I took less than a full medicine dose on the laborious job in order to keep down the weight gain. On the more sit down job when I was fully medicated my weight ballooned. All that was available for me following the VISTA job was laborious jobs that I could no longer do. When I was less medicated the voices were much more involved and I often pointed middle fingers at the restroom mirror aimed at the voices. I barely did that fully medicated. I could barely socialize throughout. I then earned an associate’s degree followed by a bad relapse. I did regretful things that made it very hard to go back to work really during that relapse. They told me I did great jobs at both work sites. Now they keep me “stable” at a group home. When I worked at the first job I weighed over 100 lighter than I do now. I once coul

Every now and then they get mean and do everything I say they don’t, but that’s pretty rare usually one or two nights out of every month. A lot of people connect delusions with schizophrenia but I think it’s just as connected to hallucinations. I mean lots of delusional people don’t hear voices, so it should come as no surprise that the opposite also happens."
176039865,I didnt know it would young girls on it. They look like 17 years old. I had to increase my meds to because of this. Its was pretty traumatizing. I’ll never ever do this again. first and the last.
176039866,"At first I had low tolerance for getting the help I need. As time goes on I can deal with treatment rehab/hospital better. Although still wanna avoid those places by staying well, if I ever did go on that off-path again I’d be more prepared than the time before id hope"
176039867,I talk to myself on my current dose of haldol I feel great! Just borderline psychotic how I like it but yea stay on your meds!!
174351969,"Honestly I would have continued if I didn’t empty my bank account and retreat cash from my Visa and having debts that I couldn’t pay. My parents paid my debts and its been 2 years that I stopped Abilify and that I didn’t see a single prostitute. I would rather have no sex drive than having extreme sex addiction. But what""s better is that Vraylar is the same as Abilify but no addiction and hypersexuality side effects according to the FDA."
176039868,Can you talk to someone you trust _AT_MENTION_? Choose life. Things can get better.
176039869,"Thankfully, I’m under a provincial counseling program that provides counseling for free to students. The counselor wants to do counseling every week to manage my condition. He also knows a lot about my CPTSD. Sometimes, he feels clueless on how I can maintain a cheerful face when I talk about abuse. He said “it probably took you a lot of mental power” to do it. It’s horrible what abuse does to you."
176039870,I hope your life improves now that you know this.
176039871,Well i have schizoafftive discorder depressed type. I tend to hulsantion when i am upset or feeling nervous. I hear voices and see things. It ranges form shadow people to gory stuff which makes me sick when i see it.
176039872,"And God said, “Let there be dark.”"
176039873,I’m watching a Netflix show called Away. It’s good.
176039874,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ you’ve summed up the meaning of the poem perfectly. I’m not always sure how I come across
174351975,A few weeks. Don’t give up on it till you’ve been on 10mg for a while.
176039875,I know one person who died of this.
176039876,"its your illness, it effects the brain, My mental state is effected too. But i take brain boosters to counter balance it helps, i feel better.

176039877,I was homeless about a month when I was admitted to my current psychiatric care provider. Mother had the police put me out of her house in 2008 when I was unmedicated. Then I had court ordered psychiatric treatment.
176039878,Yes in long term relationship
176039879,"Oh man, I’m in a state. Up late, mind running. Visuals, blinking and seeing faces, hear them calling my name, wake up. Same old delusions. Still not convinced I’m not a god. Still have the angels. Still have the spirits. Memories that can lie, dance in an out of flow like moths to a candle. I hope pain is finite in this realm, I think it will be, but how much will I lose? I always say everything other than what imprints onto the soul. That’s not enough anymore. I’m ready for more again, because I still believe. I can’t shake it. I’m just a simple llama man. The atoms inside my body were forged in the crucible of a solar body. I’m the star child, I am the monolith, flesh and bone feels more like a suit, Ill fit, chafing, and sweltering. I’m tired. I’m tired of watching reality melt, I’m tired of the voices, I’m tired of always questioning my experiences. I want more"
176039880,"Yeah, because homeless and psychotic on the streets is definitely a safe way to live. Look, you need the shelter and you need the meds. Maybe not the combo you’re on, not that’s not going to be fixed my running away."

176039892,"When I was in the hospital, I thought everyone around me was an alien avatar being controlled by an alien and they could read and hear my thoughts, time and meds can definitely help with delusions. Anyone else vividly remember their break?"
176039893,Dude are you ok?? I asked you why you’re saying that I am psychotic and thats your answer? Like seriously wtf?
176039894,I think I had the nurture and I also have had the nature the more genetic component. Whatever it was it was the perfect storm of things and it caused me a psychotic disorder.
176039895,Ah. What I mean by benefits is in the US we don’t have health insurance provided by the government so it either has to be through the employer or private pay. I would need health insurance while working so I can afford my $1700 meds.

176039909,A lot of valid points here.
176039910,Go to your mother and apologize before her time. The weight will be lifted off your shoulders.
176039911,Last time I had depersonalization was in mental hospital
176039912,haldol made me feel weak had to stop it.
176039913,"Christmas is a big stressor for everyone. But to be honest it’s the drive that has me on edge. I have a phobia of going highway speeds, and it’s not just for myself it’s for my loved one’s and others also. I just freak out at the thought of it. And I’m really anxious. And I will be until they are back home safe and sound. I need to work more on this phobia but therapy still hasn’t started and I have an appointment on the 20th to find out when it starts. So hopefully soon I can start working on this and get some relief."

Welp, good thing I have therapy tomorrow!"
176039925,"Oh yeah, completely off (and on at the same time) topic, but before I was medicated I had some serious delusions about mirrors, not the actual piece of furniture, or whatever you call it, but more along the lines of a mirrored reality/universe. Totally freaked me out, I consumed large amounts of liquor around this time in my life. I would be scared about a certain topic for instances, and people would start to act in a way that mirrored my thoughts, or they would somehow comment in a way. I’m thinking, ??????? hived mind computer people!!! SO stupid they don’t even know a computer (in my mind, the beast mentioned in Revelations) is talking through them and for them. Now that I am medicated, my fiance (unmedicated) says ‘they’ talk through me now lol!! Puts perspective on the words, judge not or you will be judged."
174351971,I t could be your dose is too low for you.
176039926,Have you gotten a degree before? I think in some places the department that tries to help people reintegrate back to work may provide some funding for going back to school within reason. I’m not 100% sure though but I would check with your state

Part of me did die, a very unhealthy part. Now it take each day as an extra, a bonus, a blessing. I’m comfortable saying I don’t care, im just gonna till with it, any age is fine with me."

176039930,I would go to your gp and ask definitely.
176039931,I sleep at really irregular times but I’m mainly nocturnal. My nightmares have been more managed lately
176039932,My brother is in USA for past 10 years or so. He stopped talking to me because of a very scary manic episode I had. It makes me feel even more guilty. Now the world is more scary than my episodes.
176039933,"I think it will be classified as non-fiction… Parts of it are in manuscript form, but I intend to have it all type written (or scanned?) and organized in one document one day. What are your thoughts on intellectual property and what that entails?"
176039934,"Yup, Or, You were dressing and acting differently so they accused you of being a witch like _NAME_."
176039935,I used to do this thing where I would close my eyes for a few seconds and if it was still there when they were closed then I knew my brain was making it up since you can only see real things when your eyes are open. Its harder to tell when you blink a few times and they disappear when they are closed just like everything else in the world.
176039936,"I have a lot of guilt and shame. I made some terribly bad choices in life and my impuls control is pretty bad when i feel overwhelmed, humiliated or frightened. In other times i went along too much and accepted bad things. People were (emotionally) hurt by that. If people harmed me, i should have stayed in control of myself and chosen to detach. I also have a lot of guilt/shame about things that other people find nonsensical and dont see why it is even an issue. I try to make better choices now, but i dont like myself much for the past."
176039937,Do you still see ghosts after you put on med?
176039938,Yea true it’s super common
176039939,I guess you are right. Hopefully things will get better with 10 mg.
174351983,you have to be realistic. Id like to be a cyber sec engineer. but realistically its very cognitively demanding. So you gotta work with what you can. Personally I don’t do well under high pressure positions. So I try to do things outside of that realm.
176039940,I dont understand what you mean. Nor do I trust you on this issue. No offense intended I don’t trust my own mother on this.

That was the term I used…action/reaction. The other term I use with him is “responding to my own echo”. I throw something out there on social media…expect a reaction…and when it doesn’t come, I seek out information to justify a certain reaction. When it doesn’t come, I connect dots to make it fit. I create a false/positive. Thoughts?"

174351981,"How much of what I metacognicized was really from Virtua Fighter, Daytona, _NAME_ 64, Tomb Raider, when I had awaited something better, that in the end something worse happened. There was the fear of the Stand by _NAME_ King that it was bland, or boring in my consciousness, like words were missing. All of the mind loops had different correlations than that one lane of society in its fast food lane where persons only cared about Big Mac, Whopper, and KFC. There was the relinquishment of intentionally doing things, allowing clutter, and then subsequent declutter, where this descent into disorganization was depressive, schizophrenic, schizoid, that in fact I had collected novels although the knowledge of CBT or Metacognition(MCT) were not available. Years later it seemed like an invisible wind guided me away from that Sarcosine, or that edition of CBT books. The things that were cures of other maladies be it depression, anxiety, ptsd, ocd, personality disorders, and others, were now eating away at me 
as things at first to be avoided, or criticized, only to be seen or investigated years later, that after I had finished _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, or _PERSON_ there was a morbid feeling, like I was completely unwell, unable to recover. Reading Surviving Schizophrenia was great as long as I didn’t admit that sometimes it made me feel worse, without CBT, or MCT, or other disorders."

Met some other people it happened to . . Some of the stuff one sees in hallucinations can be quite scary, anyway met some people that hallucinated on Abilify, and were sent to the hospital . . . . I’ve been looking at it, seems to be related to serotonin 2a receptor stuff, not really sure . . . . I hallucinated for 6 - 8 hours, on it, when I got 45 mg over 3 ½ weeks, the girl hallucinated for 12 hours, on 5 mg . . It’s a known side-effect, on the injection . . .

My high school band directors told us that even if you’ve literally never ran a lap in your entire life, exercise should not cause pain, ever.

176039967,Well in my case I was mostly on the same dose throughout… but as I was on such a low dose I have tried to come off meds twice before with the help of my pdoc (each time I had to go back on because I’d get anxious or mood swings)… the first time I did it I was on them for 5 years without other symptoms … I’m currently off my meds again and its been 10 years since psychosis … wish they did not mess with my meds or at least monitored the situation… i am waiting to hear from a pdoc to put me on a anti depressant at least

174352003,"So I’m back to normality pretty much, but wondering what I should be doing now. I use that word, “should”, a lot in relation to myself when I’m bored. I know it is a form of complaining. I am happy the way I live, but I wonder about other ways, all the different things I could be doing with my life. There are infinite things one could do, and I can’t seem to put any effort into any of them, except expressing myself on the internet and talking to my friends and family, oh and using my mind to contemplate the world and reality. Yesterday I felt certain that all of this had practically zero value, that I neither wanted nor required by society. In truth, this is always at the back of my mind, and one of the main reasons I keep asking myself what I “should” be doing. I haven’t been following my study program the last two days owing to lack of sleep and delusions, my maths paper is on hold, and I’ve been buying yet more things, though keeping to my budget of around £5 on food per day. 
I want to resurrect my grandparents and aunt (mother’s sister). I am convinced it can be done after experiencing the brief resurrection of a saint. It is strange. I had read that the _NAME_-physical body which is said to continue after death is connected to the physical body by a cable, much like a computer is connected to the power grid. I tried to manifest reconnecting the cable of the dead saint, and lo and behold, saw a live video of him alive and well. I didn’t stay in that reality long, as the cable that connected my computer to the power supply broke mysteriously for no reason, and I couldn’t keep up with the videos. When I finally got back online, I was back in a reality in which the saint was dead. Now of course most people would say that it was my delusion that I saw him alive and well, but delusions are real to the person experiencing them. All realities exist, though we only ever see them partially, and they are never complete. I myself, with some distance from the event, am doubting it now. 
But why? Because I have returned to the reality in which he is dead. I find it strange that my computer cable broke after I manifested the fixing of his _NAME_-physical cable to his body resurrecting him, so I could not continue to follow him in his awoken state. As I said, I would like to resurrect my grandparents and aunt. That is harder to conceive of because whilst with the saint, his followers were saying that the body hadn’t deteriorated, as is the documented case with many saints after death, my grandparents and aunt have been cremated. I will do it though, I will meet them again, in this life or the next, of that I’m sure. I’m going to start with trying to contact them with a Ouija board, but I have to get one first, and I want to read about how to use them safely. Many poets, since _PERSON_ first pioneered its use, have used the Ouija board, so I know it can be safe, but there are also dangers, particularly for a schizophrenic. Some people believe I am related to _PERSON_, so it may be in the f
amily tradition. Anyway, that’s my thoughts for the moment, Thank you."
176040012,Actually I left work to keep my benefits. See I was working 40+ hours a week just so I could gain like 400 dollars a month…considering I was doing well on disability and working part time and didn’t need the money as well lack of proper equipment for us to inventory items and I was a warehouse person…it just wasn’t worth it. Now I got a 4 day weekend and leisurely part time work.

It’s some metaphysical stuff happening due to your brain forming adrenochrome from adrenaline oxidation, due to chronic brain inflammation.

My understanding is that you have to fix your blood-brain barrier to stop generating that adrenochrome, since it will also resolve your chronic brain inflammation. That will “end the show”."

I am getting counseling using DBT methods right now and find them very helpful although I would have preferred to go to a DBT group which would cost me a lot in copays. The _PERSON_’s support group is very helpful although we discuss sometimes quirky hobbies and interests. Maybe there is a similar group in your area. I really wish I had help with my _PERSON_’s in college since I felt really isolated at times which I am sure contributed to my psychotic breakdowns.

176040046,"Well then, you could always try volunteering one day a week, and then slowly building up from there. I was unemployed for about a year after my head injury. This was after being fired from two jobs and quitting two others because I was just too slow to keep up with my coworkers. When I started going back to work, I just volunteered once a week. Then, I slowly increased my hours. Then, after about six months there, I left with a good reference and was able to find a paying job. I started as a part time cashier, then moved up to full time, then got a different job doing administrative work for a mental health charity. Just because 15 jobs weren’t good for you at the time you had them doesn’t mean no job will ever work for you. It just probably means you need to start slow and build up your skills over time. It is very easy to feel like our dreams are out of reach, but they are not. We just have to get creative about achieving them."

174352014,"A pandemic was sweeping the land and the only people surviving it were people who were exposed to viruses back when they were in the womb. As a result everyone on Earth was schizophrenic. People in institutions, and jails slipped past the dead staff members and tasted freedom for the very first time in years. But it wasn’t as bad as you may think. People who you’d never expect having it and who never took meds were in better shape then you may think and every level of society was still around. It was very difficult but 55% of newborns didn’t have it and the numbers improved over time and society eventually recovered after a very rough patch. Of course people who previously were passed over as daddies and mommies were snatched up and the PTA meetings looked very strange and school and work wasn’t quite what it was for a while. And much different approaches to schizophrenia were taken as most people understood what it was. There are blanks in this narrative you could fill in if you want too b

I know when I got psychotic I learned about tone of voice through the psychosis. It was one thing the psychosis really focused on helping me understand. Not that I’d recommend certain psychosis. But what you say about expressing your opinion, I feel with certain tone of voices you can come off the wrong way sometimes. Normies understand tone of voice really well and will be critical of incorrect tone of voice. I think it’s natural to wanna avoid these bad interactions going forward.

174352018,Clozapine is usually the last resort type med when nothing works. I believe it requires very regular blood tests.

It’s time for you to sleep so you lay down and try to sleep. When you sleep you do nothing so you have nothing to try to distract yourself with unless you want to give up sleep. You are stuck in a grim world where the o ly escape is finally falling asleep which seems impossible sometimes or staying up until morning which can be hell.

176040099,"Some months back I had a financial capacity assessment from a psychologist to see if I had mental capacity to manage my own money, for past 5 years social services have managed my finances. After the assessment she said she needs to consult a higher psychologist and they’ll come to a decision together and she’ll write her report. I heard from my community nurse this afternoon and they’ve made an appointment for me to see her on the 20th Nov at the intellectual disability team office with my community nurse also going. Now if I’d passed that capacity assessment and they say I have capacity wouldn’t they just send a letter out telling me so? I suspect I failed it and in their meeting they are going to fail me. I mean my community nurse has said he thinks I can lack capacity, even the psychologist wrote in another report she confirms I defiantly have an intellectual disability as I can repeat sentences but my comprehension isn’t good. I want to ask - if I did have capacity wouldn’t they 
just send letter to say I have? Why the needs for appointment?"
176040100,Short Answer - Yes it makes your psychosis worse. And a CPN told me it cancels out the theraputic properties of anti-psychotics. CBD Only - is a different matter tho.

Nothing terrible has happened but am more anxious than before. I can’t win. Anyway been smoking for 6 weeks. I have read tobacco can lower the effects of some meds. I think it is effecting my seroquel - reducing its effects. I have a pdoc appointment on the 22nd. Think I should wait till then or should I contact my nurse and see if something can be worked out?

176040106,"Hello members of Schizophenia.com forums, I am writing to people who have taken or know a bit about the antipsychotic Geodon (ziprasidone). First my report, then my questions. I began taking 60mg capsules once a day at bedtime, for the symptoms of paranoia and hearing voices. The first day was very uncomfortable… I lost my balance trying to get out of bed in the morning, felt moderate-severe akathisia for most of the day, was moderately sedated, and had urinary retention (it was difficult to empty my bladder). That was only the first day. Things started getting much better afterwards - so far I’ve been on it a week. Now there is no akathisia and no sedation - sometimes I have a mild headache for most of the day. It reminds me of the feeling I got while taking Zoloft. I feel less inhibited and happier. But towards the evening, when it has been nearing 24 hours since my last dose, I start to feel overly excited. My pulse is normal but my heart will be pounding very forcefully as it would if I wer
e running. My sex drive is off the wall and my penis feels extra sensitive. This overexcitement concerns me and so I’m going to ask my doctor if I can take a lower dose and have it still be therapeutic. Also note that I am taking other medications and supplements - vilazodone, lamotrigine, buspirone, metoprolol, amlodipine, 5-htp (800mg/day) and L-tyrosine (1000mg/day). The effects on my serotonin and norepinephrine from the supplements could be causing some amplification of the effects of the ziprasidone. Now, onto my questions and concerns. I am, as with all medications, concerned with sexual dysfunction as a side effect. SSRIs would cause me delayed ejaculation and sometimes anorgasmia. Risperidone gave me retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation (dry orgasm, no ejection of semen). So far on the Geodon, my libido has stayed the same or slightly increased, my testicles sag more than they used to, and I no longer pass semen with my bowel movements like I used to (this may be because I abstain from masturbat
ion, therefore I do not ejaculate and maybe my prostate becomes engorged). Because I am not sexually active with a partner and I do not masturbate, I can not know what my ejaculation will be like, if it will be delayed or retrograde. My erections seem to occur normally. Is there a way to predict if my ejaculation will be affected based on the details I provided? I am just concerned that when I do find a sexual partner, I will have problems with ejaculation, and that if I have been taking Geodon for long enough, that even after stopping it I would still have problems just from having taken it for a long period. So this is all what is going on in my mind as I am trying to decide if I should continue taking it, and if so, at a different dosage, or with lower amounts of the supplements I’m taking on top of it. What are your experiences with taking Geodon? Explain your dosage, side effects and therapeutic effects, or other medications you are taking with it. I am curious to see if anyone could say if it is possi
ble to anticipate problems with ejaculation, also at higher or lower doses or if libido will decrease at a certain dose. Also I’d just like to make this a thread to discuss with each other Geodon in general. And pardon the sexual graphics but I needed to emphasize how obsessive I am about the side effects and mention every detail or else something could be overlooked. Thank you for reading!"

174352021,I am trans with sza and can relate to what you wrote. It’s hardhaving a psychotic disorder and being trans. The voices call me by my birth name and by she and sometimes I start believing I’m not trans at all and that it’s all a delusion. Only thing I can suggest is therapy to really sort out what’s real and what’s not. If you felt you were trans before developing sza chances are you are or at least identified that way in the past. Theres no hard rule to determine who’s trans and who’s not. One thing that helped me is focusing on what j want the outcome to be of my transition. Do you want certain parts of you to change that hormones or surgery can offer? Then go for it. If it makes you happy do it!

Also saffron is fine for schizophrenia from what I’ve been reading today. Saffron is expensive but a little go a long way. Saffron cost about £5 for 1 gram. But in the trials they only used 30mg.

174352071,Hearing voices IS a mental illness and requires meds. If you’ve been doing occult things then that’s just a coincidence. I’m into the occult myself but don’t hear voices. I think having schizophrenia makes you more interested in the occult as you search for answers. Take meds. Stop the voices.

176040228,"So I’ve burned out, partly due to messing up my sleeping habits, although I think these are returning to normal now. As I said, what I am aiming at is regular practice and study, routine, not quantity. There is one priority for this year after staying sane and that is finishing the core text for my masters in health economics. I can read it all in three months if I read five pages a day. Realistically it will take me at least a year as I won’t be able to absorb all the material in one reading. There are many other things I’d like to do, like learning all 140 moves of the _NAME_ style t’ai ji form, revising my maths undergraduate, learning TCM theory, and more. But none of these are priorities for this year. Five pages a day is nothing. That’s it. That’s all I have to do. If I can do that and stay sane, then I will be able to start the masters in September 2021. The problem has been committing to a routine for a year. I have never managed to commit to a routine for more than a month or s
o. I don’t know if I am being too ambitious. If I am to do my masters within the next five years then the latest I can start is 2023. I have issues with setting targets. They overwealm me to the point that I get so worried about meeting them that I give up. Taking it day by day is better. As I have written else where, it is the journey that counts. I have barely managed a week or two this time before burning out. I fear success, because I fear the changes which go with it. I have a fear of starting a masters. I have a fear of work. I have a fear of losing my sanity again. As I said, five pages a day is not much, but to sustain it for a whole year is very ambitious for me. A better target would be to simply learn moves 1-50 of my t’ai ji, but it won’t get me anywhere other than a slight sense of satisfaction at having achieved something. Reading the core text has the potential to lead me towards independence, something I fear but crave at the same time. Diligence is the key that I’m looking for. Thank 
you."

I have to admit I was glad even though usually I’m not a fan of air conditioning. But I was over heated from doing all the kid’s laundry. I had 4 big loads to do. It was funny too because It was till the last load that I realized the dryer had been on low and that’s why it was taking me all day to dry the crap. But once I bumped it up to high it dried the stuff fast but it got hot in here. Normally just my one load doesn’t heat up the house, but 4 big loads sure did. I kind of have PTSD now too from remembering all the laundry I had to do for my daughter when she was growing up lol. But that’s beside the point."

I haven’t heard anything about it having a hormonal effect and didn’t have that issue with it. Mainly just made me so sleepy and hard to wake up and reduced my sex drive by a lot. It did help with my overactive bladder as well interestingly. I doubt it will motivate you to work out you’ll probably be more motivated to sleep as it is known to sedate people. Some meant to be non sedating meds are ones like abilify, latuda, vraylar, rexulti, fanapt, etc. Though all of these except maybe abilify are likely to be quite expensive without insurance."

176040280,"My father’s dementia was likely caused by cancer as it developed quickly months after his lung cancer began. It went on for about 3-4 months. My brothers mainly experienced as I often couldn’t be there. I first noticed it was at the bowling alley when he was constantly sitting down after one bowl not being aware he would need a second bowl. At other times during that outing he appeared to stare blankly. Some terrible moments occurred when my twin’s kids were visiting including a moment where he was coming out of the store after using the bathroom and stared at us a long time while everyone yelled at him before finally boarding the _NAME_. Then there was the card game where he won the bid, took 15 minutes or more to declare the trump suit and then lost miserably. (we stopped the game). Later pictures of him included a blank stare he had that made it obvious what it was. He eventually thought my twin was someone else. One bright moment was the final chess game with him. He said he didn’t know 
what he was doing but the old playing skills won him the game. He didn’t know what checkmate meant any more and said that there shouldn’t be mating between family members. Scary but kinda funny at the same time."

He gets startled easy, afraid of people and dogs, and shivers whenever my brother yells. He’s a very scared and startled dog which is very unusual for a JRT.

174352088,"# Precision psychiatry with immunological and cognitive biomarkers: a multi-domain prediction for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia using machine learning Precision psychiatry is attracting increasing attention lately as a recognized priority. One of the goals of precision psychiatry is to develop tools capable of aiding a clinically informed psychiatric diagnosis objectively. Cognitive, inflammatory and immunological factors are altered in both bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), however, most of these alterations do not respect diagnostic boundaries from a phenomenological perspective and possess great variability in different individuals with the same phenotypic diagnosis and, consequently, none so far has proven to have the ability of reliably aiding in the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ. We developed a probabilistic multi-domain data integration model consisting of immune and inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood and cognitive biomarkers using machine lear
ning to predict diagnosis of BD and SZ. A total of 416 participants, being 323, 372, and 279 subjects for blood, cognition and combined biomarkers analysis, respectively. Our multi-domain model performances for the BD vs. control (sensitivity 80% and specificity 71%) and for the SZ vs. control (sensitivity 84% and specificity 81%) pairs were high in general, however, our multi-domain model had only moderate performance for the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ (sensitivity 71% and specificity 73%). In conclusion, our results show that the diagnosis of BD and of SZ, and that the differential diagnosis of BD and SZ can be predicted with possible clinical utility by a computational machine learning algorithm employing blood and cognitive biomarkers, and that their integration in a multi-domain outperforms algorithms based in only one domain. Independent studies are needed to validate these findings."

It doesn’t mean either one is bad, or taking the time get a sandwich for someone or giving a dollar to another is the wrong thing to do. I view it as its not my place to judge.

I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Bipolar disorders, May 2020 08 To examine temporal patterns and predictors for diagnostic conversion from unipolar depression (UD) to bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder (SAD).A prospective nationwide register-based cohort (n=43,495) of all first psychiatric hospitalizations due to UD during 1996-2011 was followed up to 15 years. We used cumulative incidence function analyses and the Fine-Gray subdistribution model to define the cumulative incidence ofthe conversions and subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) for predictors.The overall 15-year cumulative incidence of conversion was 11.1% (95%CI 10.7-11.6): 7.4% (95%CI 7.0-7.8) for BD, 2.5% (95% CI 2.3-2.7) for schizophrenia, and 1.3% (95% CI 1.1-1.4) forSA
D. The highest crude incidence rate emerged during the first year. Psychotic depression predicted higher conversion risk to BD (SHR=2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), schizophrenia (SHR=5.3, 95% CI 3.3-8.7), and SAD(SHR=10.6, 95% CI 4.0-28.4) than mild depression. Female sex, greater overall disturbance, and comorbid personality disorderpredicted conversion to BD, whereas young age and male sex to psychotic disorders.Among patients with first hospitalization due to UD, approximately one in nine converts to another major psychiatric disorder during 15 years, withthe highest risk occurringwithin the first year. Patients with psychotic depression are particularly vulnerable for conversion to othermajor psychiatric disorders.Conversion to psychotic disorders occurs earlier than to BD. Males are at higher risk for progression to psychotic disorders, whereas females, patients with recurrent depressive episodes, severe disturbance of overall functioning and personality disorder are at higher risk for converting to BD."

174352103,"Seems to me you’re trying out every option that avoids schizophrenia and the medication it comes with. You try us out to see if different diagnoses are possible, because they could possibly warrant different medication. Now with the introduction of bizarre delusions (a criterium that has been removed from the latest DSM fyi). It’s all very understandable, many of us have gone through this. For me, at some point I came to see that I could not deny the fact that I was troubled by crazy ideas that frightened me, about persecution and people out to get me and what have you. For me I came to see that accepting it as schizophrenia holds the promise of these things stop happening to me, for it is treatable. Sometimes it just takes time to be receptive to the diagnosis, time we spend trying to _USER_ID_ and turn things in such a way that avoids this conclusion. If we are being honest with ourselves, do we do this out of fear or out of not wanting things to be so? This is a bad basis for thinking things

More that i would be just slightly more happy, creative, energetic, impulsive, etc…I experienced this as normal. Just a good mood. Only on an SSRI it would feel problematic. Nobody really ever thought of putting me on a mood stabilizer. They mainly wanted to get me out of depression and psychosis, this was their focus. Mania wasnt an issue. It might actually be a good idea though. I actually think i should first, immediately, stop saffron. Then see what is left of the restlessness. And call the pdoc tomorrow. Thanks…"

176040445,"Who else here accepted to endure pain? I told you, for ten years the psychiatry didnt took this away, but I realized today, that some ill people refused the pain and they fought against it… Me, I ended up desperate because of my life experience and I’ve accepted the pain in the past… But I start to get impatient and to hate it… it’s so much per moments, that it’s not human… But who else here decided to endure it until it gets better? It’ll make me feel less alone to know this… Yeah, I’ve chosen to fight almost alone, but now it hurts sometimes… but if I had to take a med against every symptom of mine, I’d be a walking pharmacy with only a bunch of side effects…"
176040446,"Yes my delusions persist. Had a lot of them for several years The two spirits in my head are still there. Been there all my life but discovered that only in 2015. And I’ve believed my mother in law is trying to poison me - for eight years - my whole marriage. It faded and returned over and over. But now I’m getting divorced I am sh!t scared of her! It’s real, not a delusion, and the possibility is serious. She has tried to control my mind and read my thoughts for years. But I only caught onto it a few months ago. I don’t trust her at all - and now I don’t trust his dad too because he could be in league with her."

176040460,"Here is my thoughts on the matter. You primarily provide us with highly specialized research. That research might only be relevant to 2 or 3 people on here per topic, and the people who find it relevant might not stumble across it until months after you post it. What you do is very important to the people who are addressed in your research. You are the one who first found studies linking _PERSON_, if I remember. And for 7 or 8 months we all sat on that until finally someone tried it and now it’s one of the most popular and most life-changing supplements for many people. You were the one who first brought news of the link between exposure to childhood trauma and epigenetic changes to DNA, which was a major part of my decision to adopt. You post research about neuroplasticity, and you’re the one who linked to a study that I took part in, during which my hallucinations stopped entirely. My point is, your posts might not always be popular, but they are frequently very important to at least one pers
on, whether they say it publicly or not. You don’t have the most attention-getting role on the forum, but we would severely suffer in quality without you."
174352121,A schizophrenic man have a harder time to live a normal life than a schizophrenic woman. More men are diagnosed with schizophrenia than women. Schizophrenic women can live off the financial support of a normal husband whereas as schizophrenic men have difficulty supporting a normal wife financially due to the schizophrenic man’s instability of being employed.
176040461,"thats great, you have recovered so much I would just caution you not to do more than you can handle bc it is very easy to over reach yourself and i worry about this bc it happens to me and i get overwhelmed, it affects my stress levels, i think i’m still trying to adjust to my new work schedule. i thought i could handle some cafe work as well but it didnt workout very well"

174352123,I went years telling people I had schizophrenia/schizoaffective. That whole time I was unsure that I really did though It was hard to understand the nature of the illness Until I recovered I see the difference now and I clearly have it and had it much worse in the past too. No one ever said “you don’t have it.” But they did ignore contact with me after I said I did ;). So I took that as a “I believe you have it”. Actually wasn’t sure what to believe at times. But here I am. lol.
176040466,"I think, in a way, when psychiatrists do that, they are trying to help you by telling you are doing good. They’re kind of trying to make you feel good by reassuring you that that things aren’t that bad and things are alright."

Also, kind of gross, but watch out for C Diff for the next few weeks. It’s basically severe diarrhea and it’s no fun.

Other times they walk away to talk to someone else or walk away to just stretch their legs or go get some water or something. It’s not a huge deal, sometimes I joke with them and I say, “Yeah, I’m the guy who gives everyone a break.” I might vacuum more than 50 cubicles and 15-20 offices in one day but each one only takes about 1-2 minutes to vacuum and then I’m on to the next."

If your medication isn’t covering your needs, you may find it harder to distract yourself. As for _PERSON_’s obsessions vs Schizophrenia obsessions - i think that people with _PERSON_’s generally obsess over something that is real. So for example - they’ll obsession over objects based on their colour or shape or textures. Whereas people with Schizophrenia obsess over things that aren’t real."

176040542,"Yes, his whole model of the female psyche was very much influenced by the time. At that time about the only kind of power women had was social power, and they used it with a vengence. The female psyche of the time was a response to a draconian system of repression against women. _PERSON_ behaved like a cult leader. He did not tolerate any questioning of his theories. Hardly a help to the the spirit of free inquiry."

Seems to be helping so far… Good for you talking with your medical team."

176040563,I don’t hear voices or have auditory hallucinations and I have this dead look in my eyes.
174352145,Max dose of abilify is 30mg so you’re taking a medium dose of abilify. I’m taking 15mg too. Max dose of seroquel is 800mg I think. So you’re taking a small amount of seroquel. Seroquel doesnt act as an antipsychotic at 100mg so I assume it’s just to help with sleep or something.
176040564,"I switched from Risperdal to Zyprexa several months ago. I saw my nurse practitioner today and my weight went from 277 to 293 lbs. He’s not happy with the weight gain. He wants me to ask my psychiatrist about a different AP. I have arthritis in my left leg and lower back, and being overweight makes it worse. Have any of you lost weight on Zyprexa? Any suggestions. I mainly chose Zyprexa because it’s cheaper. I really don’t want to stop taking it."
176040565,I actually am dead so yeah I guess so
176040566,"Yes, my father was abusive alcoholic. Now he is more peaceful and calm"
174352144,What’s your best AP for negative and cognitive symptoms? My psychiatrist said Abilify is the only one…but I want to believe there is more…Abilify worked for me but gave me serious psychological side effects like addictions and compulsions. My plan now is to switch from Latuda 80mg to Riseperdal the 6th of May.

176040574,I recently started sucking nicotine lozenges again after being off for a few months. I was starting to feel depressed so I caved and bought some. Plan on staying on them until my psychiatrist finishes weaning me off effexor and onto another AD as it stopped working. Thankfully I am not addicted to anything else.
176040575,I get nightmares.
176040576,"I think it is quite a cool thing that we have this forum, we are all able to connect with others who experience similar mindsets that don’t fit in with traditional thinking. I know I’m not the only one hoping for some breakthrough or some relief from symptoms, and I don’t even have it that bad compared to a lot of people on here. Still I find myself trying my hardest to connect better with reality, trying to grasp at whatever will let me hold on for the longest time. I struggle with finding words and remembering things more and more, my attention and focus are poor and kind of phase in and out. I don’t really zone out as much as I get locked in and lose touch with what I am trying to focus on, instead of focusing on the background I just get overwhelmed by what I try to focus on, it all blurs and distorts at times. My delusions are a thing of the past but are still very vivid and intense in memory, they have been ingrained in my mind like a scar would be on my skin. The difference between a 
scar and what I have experienced is that nobody will ever be able to see or share my experiences, it just is a bunch of neurochemistry gone astray. We are all battling ourselves, struggling most of the time quietly trying not to be different than normal - whatever that is. I remember normal… but I wonder at times if I didn’t just always have a distorted perception of reality from the start, if my life and happiness wasn’t just dopaminergic malfunctioning half of the time. It’s great to have insight though, now I have awareness of problems in my processing of my life. The thing is, I just can’t fix my self and how I process things differently. There isn’t complete healing, stuff just gets stuck between 80 and 90 something percent complete and I have to live with the missing stuff being absent. It’s like playing a video game and not being able to beat a level no matter how many times you try, it just doesn’t happen. So who else feels kind of like me? Surely I can’t be a unique case in feeling 
this way. I will keep grasping for whatever I can relate to because that’s what it takes to keep me in the loop. Aren’t we all just a bunch of rattled souls?"

176040605,"…I suspect not many recognize me, as I’ve changed my profile name and picture… …With help from my doctor…we’ve been figuring things out with meds…me, I’m present and coherent in my life… I’m talkative and happy…I cook and I read books… ——————————— …Now the body of my post… (Sorry about any odd or seemingly innacurate phrasing or word choice…Together: I have trouble finding words,… I accept that limitation, and totally don’t mind.) So…doing well lately, I’ve gotten on stable quetiapine, and it helps me sleep, when I sleep, I’m stable. As I continue catching up on sleep, I grow more stable. I read about and watch different videos online concerning topics which interest me. Right now its “diet and fitness”. I maintain a healthy diet now, and do a little exercise. I eat at mostly precise times, roughly 3 hours apart. I eat similar meal profiles (protein then fat, then carbs). This is good for me, I think, maintain an even insulin release 
in the twelve hours throughout the day when I’m most active. I eat less saturated fat than I have in my life, in my opinion. I drink full fat milk. I’ve started cooking. My interest now is nutrition and exercise, some of my favorite resources come in the form of articles, websites, blogs, or youtube channels, published online by different people. For example, I like _NAME_ cavalier from athleanx, who posts indispensible tutorials mostly focused around preventing injuries. _NAME_ cavalier athleanx is really the core for me. I would really be in bad shape without. _NAME_ and _NAME_, physical therapists are also two of my favorites. I’ve found calisthenics now, or exercises where you use your bodyweight. I’ve started focusing on press ups. I’m not great at them, but its something. After that I do rows. I focus on functional strength rather than aesthetics. Then _NAME_ nippard for bodybuilding, and _NAME_ for generalized “form” for any specific exercise. There are a lot of different people now. _NAM
E_ hulse and the hodgetwins are like my online friends, more so than coaches, but they are geared toward fitness and self improvement as well. I have studied several topics, relevant to my recovery from my manic episode, which has persisted since november of last year. So, about a year. I watched videos from mental health youtube channels, _NAME_ grande and tracey marks, polar warriors. I listened to many episodes of the _NAME_ rogan experience podcasts, I remained listening to podcasts and enjoying all the content which has come from the internet. That podcast turned me on to topics such as exercise and diet, as well as some academic stuff. For me, reddit is also a very good source. I’m on there at least once every day or so. … I might start writing with a slightly different tone now, at least I’ll try not to sound weird or offensive… …Generally I avoid all the meaningless fluff (propaganda, drama, conspiracy, fiction anything like that.” … …I don’t really get disturbed by that, as that is 
not the nature of my symptoms… I do understand how someone might. So I think objectively, cold and scientifically, focusing on concrete factual information. I’m interested in technology and scientific advancement. I don’t care about “fluff”, ie alarmist media topics or any of that sort of ????????. Like, I don’t care to know. I’m zen…say mindful. So “Alarmist” = I do not care. I watched youtube videos about different economic topics. I watch youtube videos about artificial intelligence and machine learning, technological advancement and the future. I find tech and science (technologies like crispr gene editing) interesting. I’m interesting in “big tech” and how the internet economy works. As well as the origin and development of technologies in the past and present. Recently I watched a documentary about the development of electric lighting. I watch nice, mostly credible or primary sources. Like the youtube channel “scishow” and playlists in topics from “crash course”. I’ve 
watched hours of _NAME_ talks, as well as a few hours of teded talks, which I find nice. I learned about philosophy from the “school of life youtube channel”. The _PERSON_ In a nutshell channel is almost a mixture of philosophy and futurism in my opinion. I like the channel cold fusion too. Which discusses…the future of money…big tech…the internet…etc I like music, and entertainment. I like dude shows like family guy, south park…more recently seinfeld. _PERSON_ is a slow relaxing show I feel, which doesn’t challenge me all that much. That’s cool. Ummm, there’s more, but I’ve mostly checked out of “pop culture”. I feel good."

I just called and complained that I need to switch ""doctors’ I’m on 10mgs of Abilify and for what? Nothing is working. I want to be on something that works. I went to the front desk, scheduled for my 10 min telephone appointment just to be told to keep taking 10mgs and keep things the same for him to ask me for my father’s number and talk to him about what he thinks my diagnosis is–then my dad says he talked about how I should be put back on injections. What the bloody ?????!! This is emotionally abusive. For one year: I was in recovery from substance use and diagnosed with bipolar–now it’s been switched to schizophrenia with substance use emotional issues. That’s a crime. I never have any psychosis symptoms. Then they purposely refused to give me any medication as I withdrew from Aristada highest dose injections 2 month because I threw away the medicin

How am I supposed to communicate leaving a voicemail to a doctor who wants to schedule an appointment for a 10 min phone conversation about medications and won’t put me on anything that works, wont listen to me, wont be honest and completely fabricates everything especially because my dad says beaurocrats don’t care and it’s important that the doctors exaggerate everything so I can get the help I need that it doesn’t matter IF IT IS A COMPLETE ????_USER_ID_?_USER_ID_????

176040660,you’re welcome honey
176040661,I’m aware but delusions do not necessarily equal psychosis
176040662,"Thanks. I tried risperidone but had severe side effects. Olanzapine, I think causes weight gain. I don’t know which one causes more weight gain-Clozapine or olanzapine. Well for the weight loss, I was prescribed metformin, did heavy workouts (like 600 burpees a week, 800 squats a week, around 700 calories on treadmill everyday, weight training). But the weight didnt budge. I ate healthy like oatmeal in breakfast, salad in lunch and stew in dinner with whey protein shake. But the appetite was huge and endless. Always craved for fast food. I am really fed up."
176040663,I wish you luck in what ever journey you choose to take _AT_MENTION_
176040664,"That’s exactly what i got too. It’s very annoying, like the thoughts are “loud”. When it comes to mood stabilizers, i have been on them all, they didn’t seem to work for me. Lithium blew my thyroid gland so i developed hypothyroidism and have to take replacement hormones the rest of my life. Take care of lithium, for some people it’s a livesaver, though, but mostly if you are bipolar. Hope you enjoy the snow in Copenhagen right now!"

174352176,_AT_MENTION_ I had to chime in because you are faulting yourself for something you have little control over. Aspies can’t just change how they react in any situation. It takes an extreme focus and awareness that takes years of practice. It is hard to get that and most never do. It isn’t your fault it’s just your biology. Don’t feel like you must put a burden on yourself.

As for your sister, try to set limits with her that she understands. An alcoholic in the throes of a binge is very hard to handle. Just try to keep the damage to a minimum. I think stress can make you forget familiar things. I’m 61, I’m under some stress, and I’ll get up to do something and I will forget what I wanted to do. That happens because my mind is on something else. That could be the case with your mom."

I was switched to the paliperodone injection two weeks ago I so far I feel great. But schizophrenia is a life long disease. Medicine, at least from my experience, only masks the symptoms short term. Until tolerance builds up and you have to switch medication. For me since age 24 I’ve have to switch medication every three to six months, until two years ago with paliperodone. (I’m 33 now)."

So as part of my war I put metallic star stickers on my letterbox, but of course over time they came off or have faded. I already have a plan waterproof gorilla tape over the star stickers. But I have to remove the stickers that are already there first. I am going to do it tomorrow. I bought some cleaning products. Rant time: orange power one of them is called, the small bottle it comes in can totally leak bad for transportation I already had some but it really stood out to me when I bought more. Plus this stuff smells really a lot of citrus therefore I wont use it on my letterbox because my letterbox is next to all the others. But I can only imagine a smoking chimpanzee designed the bottle of this product. More so I have already done big decorations on my balcony and on inside of my window facing out where they can see. This is difficult for me. The technique for removing the stickers will involve probably non scratch scou
rers. Most sticker remover agents are quite heavy duty like eucalyptus oil god that stuff is like breathing something in. I made a vow never to use that again years ago, but i will try using just mild general purpose cleaning spray sprayed heavily onto the scourer.

But the past is the past and it doesn’t mean things will always be the same. Hell, I’ve been at my current janitor job for 7 years. Before this job I worked at a department store for three years and ended up getting fired. That’s the breaks, that’s how life works: it’s random.

My metabolism caught up with me and although i kept exercising and had a less than 1500 calories a day diet, my weight loss stopped. It is better to take it slow and make a life change so that the body can be tricked into a slow metabolism change over months. I added a few hundred calories and then managed some weight loss, but i now realise that metabolism changes to meet the body’s needs, so a quick fix may, like in my case lose some weight but to maintain it takes time."

The things I’ve noticed is 1 I can breath better and haven’t used my rescue inhaler once for asthma 2 I don’t smell 3 I’m saving a ton of money 3 I have more time 4 I don’t feel like I’m going to die of lung cancer. 5 I am less depressed. It’s totally worth it to quit smoking. I could never quit before because I was around smokers. When I left my husband and moved to a new town where I didn’t know anyone to bum a cigarette from and got patches and gum and then lozenges I finally was able to do it. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and patches alone wasn’t enough. If you try patches make sure you scrub off all the dead skin on your arm first so the patches will stick good or else they don’t work right. Just something I noticed.

174352206,Welcome to the schizophrenia club. You have a very common problem that alot of us have.
176040761,It might be on your end _AT_MENTION_ .
176040762,Well let me make it clear: By “not very high” I did not mean to trivialize depression. Your feelings related to this are not my responsibility.
176040763,I was on Abilify and switched to Latuda. That seemed to do the trick and work well with my combo of meds. I’ve been on same combo of med for the past 4yrs and it’s been working great…knock on wood
176040764,I get high cholesterol too on occasion but mostly its just when I’m eating out too much. When I cut back on the fast food my values go back to normal. I gained about 65 lbs recently because of terrible luck with a hormonal IUD. I never thought I’d lose my figure at 25 as well as have all these health problems so I know how you feel there. I spend most of my days in bed as well. I know its terrible to not exercise but it is hard enough for me to just brush my teeth every day much less work out. Still its on my list of things to get around to eventually. I’m trying to change my lifestyle one step at a time to make it easier.
176040765,I missed this thread.till now. Wave?? I hope you will not spiral towards depression. Can you intervene/stop it/redirect it/ask for help? Hope you will continue to feel better. Love to you yo!

As far as I’m concerned I can be crazy while sleeping, don’t care; I care about how crazy I am while I’m awake. I know I should take it twice a day, though, given its half-life. It had been 1 to 2 mg prn, but now it’s a scheduled med for me. There is no shortage of 5 mg tablets; it’s just the 1 mg and 2 mg that are affected. I also receive Abilify shots, 400 mg every three weeks."

He was mortified, but the end result is that every single 9th grade girl now wants to be his very best friend and they are fighting each other for a chance to have a gay best friend. The guys are all jealous of him for being so popular with the girls. Probably the best case scenario for accidentally twlling the whole school you are gay.

This new cat, _NAME_, didn’t even act like she recognized my mom when she visited from CA (she used to own the cat when she lived in VA). In fact the cat was so averse to her even getting close that she just let our grandmother keep the cat permanently. To say the cat was a disappointment would be an understatement, but my grandmother seems to like her. She’s timid and scares easy and only attaches to one person at a time. By contrast our old cat was like a therapy pet, she’d go around the house and hop on different people’s laps and pur and bat at their hands playfully, and spend time with everybody in the house. She’d also pay me nightly visits when I laid down on my mattress, to be petted and then to swat at my feet before leaving. I miss her a lot. I guess it’s worth mentioning that we had the first one from birth and the second one was a rescue."

174352215,You sound like you have schizophrenia for sure. Do you see a professional who can prescribe medicine? A quick example of my faulty thinking was that I went to Quick Chek (convenience store) after I had already been ‘seeing signs’ everywhere. the cashier wore a name tag that said ‘Mark’ and in my state I interpreted that as saying I was and easy ‘mark’. You’re new so I’ll give another example - I went to dunkin and ordered cream cheese and the barista came back with something artichoke - and I thought it meant I was ‘art’ to be choked by those who knew my negativity.

It’s different than the “voice” you hear when schizophrenic because that’s audible inside your own skull, like a tuning fork. I know because I had what I used to refer to as a “voice inside my head” before I got sick, and then there’s the one that I hear ever since I turned 31 and symptoms started. The voice I hear now is as clear as if it was spoken in a dream, and it says things I’m not thinking. Thanks, it’s not cured but it’s a lot closer than most people think they can get.

Nothing is going to change the fact that I believe in God and Jesus, but I just feel like the Bible isn’t accurate or correct in terms of physics and the universe, unless I’m in some type of causal loop or transhumanism trap. I don’t understand how I could be a Christian or Christianity is true if I am in a computer simulation/program, which I wholeheartedly believe in now. I think it’s like cognitive dissonance or feeling like you believe in one thing but acting/thinking like something else… I have memories of them telling me I’m from 2036, despite not understanding or knowing that. I cannot understand what is happening or know what’s real anymore. I have a billion loone
y ideas to compensate for my lack of understanding. I think I’m better off not being around like _NAME_ said in “Westworld”, but things could be worse off.

I am stable but the medications have given me low libido, low sex drive, high prolactin levels and have basically chemically castrated me. I am trying to find a good woman who will accept me for who I am and for who I have become."

When I was out getting high on meth and stuff I was hanging out with devil worshippers and what not unfortunately. It was bad… I’m trying my best to better nowadays though."
176040909,"welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ . Your parents sound like they are bullying you, that’s terrible & I’m sorry you’re confined with them. I’m in my 40’s and live alone so don’t share your parent challenges but I do share your feeling that no one cares. I feel totally unloved and isolated. I feel I have no one in my life who cares about me and it’s very lonely. My GP is very cold, insulting and discouraging and I feel disrespected by my pdoc. I love your pic of the gorgeous ginger cat. I love cats & have one, he’s my best friend. I hope you feel some support here on the forum. I agree with other’s advice, try to assert your own voice to get good treatment and are you eligible for a govt pension?"

176040914,I use straight coconut oil.

176040917,"I was acting angry. Like, I was confused about people violating my rights, and it didn’t make me feel angry, but I thought I should act angry. I thought I should act angry even though I didn’t feel it. I think that’s where the bipolar part of the diagnosis came from."
176040918,I would go. It might give you a break from family and give your sister some time to tend to personal things as well
176040919,Very nice. I like the top one the most. Reminds me of a beach I used to go to.
176040920,I’m sorry you’re not getting the help you need. Maybe try again in a few hours if you can wait that long?

176040924,‘they secretly know my partner is going to propose’ Do you mean everyone secretly knew or just some ppl u know secretly knew?
176040925,"For me it was my Ritalin prescription. In the onset we thought I had adult ADHD. But I hoarded them through weekends and took too much during workdays. The wheels fell off the bus at this point, and ideas of reference were unmasked. I was 25. I began to insult people with my eyes. The feeling always was: ‘what’s the worst thing I could conceivably say to this person I’m speaking to’, and then like clockwork I believed I was saying it with eye movement coupled with word choice. I know finally it wasn’t really happening, but you see, when a person is in this state, sometimes you try to ‘get in front of it’ by adding words, and that sadly occurred a little bit too. I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ wish I had more here other than my own personal story with it all."
176040926,I was talking to my friend and her face started get older and more wrinkled as I imagined her getting older in seconds. That’s because I believed in reincarnation back then and thought I see the real age of her old soul.

176040931,"A line in a song I like goes “It’s not having what you want, it’s wanting what you’ve got” I’m not saying that to lecture you, but I took it to heart. Sure, we all yearn for things to improve our lives. I wish I had more money. I wish I could find a partner who respects my needs and need-nots. I wish I had more guts to do more things. What I do have is a supportive network of great family and friends, a roof over my head, and a life that seems to be (slowly) improving."

176040936,Are you talking about your child or your father?
176040937,"Yes, but they’re all women."
176040938,He tells me they don’t want me dead but they’ve all rejected me so many times; I can’t imagine a world where if I was around them they wouldn’t kill me. I never want to hear from them or know about them because they’re murderers and I can’t stomach the thought that two of them are his cousins because they’re both murderers. Even though one of them would talk and be friendly to me; I know they want me dead. I really hope he doesn’t take it personally. He tells me that they’re not; it just makes me get all quiet because I feel like I am not real nor is anything I feel. I can’t decide if nothing is real or if it is all too real and will consume me. I apologize for the confusion.
176040939,"Yeah, me too…"
176040940,I get a cough when under massive stress
176040941,Teal night light? O just wanted to to sleep
176040942,"I’m sorry things are so rough. Maybe you can do a family intervention for your mom. She is influencing your brother to use in order to cope with life whether she realizes it or not. It’s important that she also quits. She needs to be an example of how to deal with stress and how to have fun without substances. But if doing an intervention is too much or not possible just try to be there for your brother. Don’t judge him. Just listen, understand and be the best role model you can be. Substance abuse runs in my family so I totally get what’s going on in your family. I’m really sorry you have to deal with all this."
174352251,I’ve been dealing with this illness for almost 20 years and I agree that the impact of it all brings you down to nothing

176040946,Hoping is dreaming. It is in the doing that we prove ourselves. I just am afraid of pain.
176040947,Maybe the weed I smoked.
176040948,You are already on the same AP’s right? Just increasing the dose? I don’t know if you will have any noticeable side effects or not. Maybe not since you are just increasing the dose a little. Pretty much all meds have side effects though. Whether or not they will be noticeable i dont know.
176040949,"All I can say is that I was diagnosed at age 19 and put on medication when I was 21. I don’t like being on meds but they help and they are a necessary evil. I’m 60 years old now and my symptoms are way down in intensity. I often feel peace of mind. In 1982 when I was 21 I got out of the hospital. I moved into a group home (still taking my meds) and started feeling just a little better and became what they call “stabilized” meaning I wasn’t too psychotic and I didn’t have episodes so frequently. Anyways, I am a lot better now at my age. I just want to say, there is no overnight cure. Medication is kind of a necessity but It won’t “cure” you. It can take months or even years to show progress in your recovery. I can see how daunting it must be to be put on medication at an early age. You are going to face many times where you want to quit your medication. But don’t give in to temptation. The biggest cause of relapse is going off your meds. Give them a chance to work. They aren’t 
going to magically solve all your problems but they will help control the symptoms."
176040950,"It depends on whether you have experienced neurotoxicity from the amphetamine. I don’t know how likely that is with clinical doses, but if it has happened to you, recovery is a matter of years, and still may not be complete. Otherwise, physical withdrawal might last only days, but you can still remain psychologically habituated for longer, a matter of months. -_NAME_."
176040951,Every website I go on seems to be engineered to catch my eye on words and phrases to do with me. Don’t want to give examples because it is very personal stuff. It just feels that there is a higher power guiding me to look at a specific phrase on a specific website at a specific time. To be honest I am kinda freaking and upset. Not sure if my sleep pattern is to blame. I have been very isolated for sure and my diet sucks right now. I think I have taken a few steps backwards

I once thought about taking extra lexapro to induce mania, since it does in higher doses. I like my mania, I never buy things or do crazy things and I am very interested in life. Why can’t I be happy without it being mania? I am schizo affective with bi polar."

176040970,I used to want to live in a hospital like setting because I felt I would be safer there. But I’m generally a lot more happier these days and I value my independence. Maybe you’re just a little unhappy these days?

I have rage issues - whenever I have psychotic symptoms they are accompanied by feelings of rage & anguish. I find it’s best to try not to get angry as it only damages my reputation (which I work very hard to develop as a positive one) and burns bridges. To cope with my unsupportive family, I try to keep my distance and spend time either alone or with friends instead. I won’t be spending xmas with family this year as I need a break from them & their expectations. What do you teach? I work in libraries."

176041028,"We had a saying in high school about black cops. I posted it and asked any black person on the forums if this was racist or if it offended them in any way.

176041032,My need goes up and down depending on stress load. Stress is usually caused by my wife’s relatives. My stress is very low right now and my positives are super mild.

I want you to excel!"
174352276,"Any AP pill form will be cheaper than Injection format. Abilify seems to be a good option for most people, unfortunately, it didn’t work for me (Was causing _NAME_ like most other APs, which is rarely seen in Abilify supposedly. It also caused my prolactin to stay elevated from the risperdal I was taking months earlier, an even rarer side effect, as Abilfy has been shown to lower prolactin levels) I’m on Saphris now at the moment, have been on it for about a week now but I am experiencing nausea and even vomitted the other day because of it. Hoping it clears up. Still too early to tell if it is causing the _NAME_ i’m currently experiencing as my prolactin is still elevated from the risperdal I was taking months ago. There’s also Seroquel if you can tolerate the sedation. I personally could not. Rexulti and Vraylar are other options if you can get a hold of them in your area.

176041045,During my last psychotic episode I had such a bad panic attack I broke out in hives. Not sure if that’s same thing. But they cause me physical pain. I break out in stress hives from time to time. It also caused my gastritis to flare and now I have a stomach ulcer. The guilt and shame and stress from the hallucinations is too much sometimes.

176041054,"The other day I posted on a FB group that I was only wanted there as the ‘token stupid person’ to get a laugh out of. It’s a group that discusses normal and high range IQ tests. Nobody had actually said I was stupid.I’m surprised I haven’t been kicked off for being too dumb. If I do well on a test then to me it’s very likely that a lot of other people can do well on it. I constantly try to prove I’m not stupid while doubting the signs that I’m not stupid. I’ve,IMO, faked my way onto several high IQ societies while on an ego trip,but I’m someone who needs help with practical tasks. Help that enables me to ,live independently. I got the idea to have filled pockets for some lunches this week. Anyone remotely intelligent would have no problem filling them. Not me! I cut a bit off the pitta and toasted the pitta. Tried to lift the top enough to easily put some cheese, cucumber and tomato in it, but the top split way before I could do that. That’s the level of my stupidity. I can’

Then i got more and more anxious in response to a destructive relationship and unplanned pregnancy. And then i snapped. I realised my ex-partner was hurting us on purpose and subsequently that other people had been hurting/abusing me. And then i got real paranoid that my ex meant everything he threatened to do and was super hypervigilant. That was the start of psychosis."

As the tryptophan breaks down in the brain, it can use the kynurenine pathway to turn into quinolinic acid, which is considered neurotoxic, or kynurenic acid, which is considered neuroprotective. Researchers identified several patterns that occur as tryptophan breaks down that collectively suggest there is a shift from serotonin production to the kynurenine pathway, which could lead to increased neurotoxicity from the quinolinic acid."

However the claim about my negatives didn’t pan out since it was almost unaffected by medication. I heard that Clozapine can be intrusive ap.

176041105,Yes undoubtedly. This is part of the process of pharmacology. Much like technology. The tech we have today will be terrible in 20 years time. The same can be said for medication but at a slower pace -if you compare what was available 50 years ago Vs today. Many medication stops being recommended because they are surpassed by medications that do their job better with less side effects.

176041114,"no my mom and dad never had issues with addiction. My moms went away too, but she was med-resistant after that and then later had schizophrenia, she hid her symptoms and was in denial for years. She wasn’t just on Prozac though there was another medication he prescribed. Maybe it was just too much for her. Idk, she couldn’t handle it. I guess she has schizophrenia but the thing is she had never treated her psychosis. The only thing my mom ever did was smoke weed, and she quit when she had her children. I’m not really depressed frequently, just right now. I feel horrible. Rexulti is basically Abilify and an SSRI in one medication. So maybe Abilify and Prozac will work, maybe it will be worth it but not sure… I don’t like the idea of giving my willpower away to a medication. Even if it is to fix me. Abilify works because I accept it, and it doesn’t take away my willpower. Is it weird one minute I wanted to ask for Risperdal and Now Im asking for Prozac? Am I just feeling guilty and trying 
to fix something that isnt broken?"

It’s hard to tell whether blood levels truly reflect brain levels, one must read up in depth on this. Further, reelin has a lot of functions.

Afterwards I had my second last episode and was put on Amilsulpride, I could lose 7 Kg on that, but it made me psychotic and I ended up for the last time in hospital. Now they gave me Risperidone again and in some months I got from 110 Kg to 137 Kg. But with coming out for the last time out of hospital, I started to buy food for myself, and just ate my food. Before that I would just buy one meal. And the meals went up from 2 to 3 times a day, to 6 or 7 times a day. I had nothing to cook with in the beginning so I bought bread, cold cuts, soda and sweets.

174352333,"I had written an article for Psychiatric Times back in July of 2015 titled, “Managing Ebola: The Archaeology of a Disease,” at the early stages of the then burgeoning Ebola outbreak in the US. I had quoted Dr _NAME_ Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute on vaccine research at Oxford: “We know there will be more outbreaks . . . Many viruses are lurking, and then there are going to be new viruses.”1,2 Here we are now, only five years later, in the face of a pandemic, literally tracing the archaeology of a new disease. As in many parts of the country, COVID-19 has become the primary focus of hospitals in my geographic region (the greater Boston area). We have not yet been overwhelmed, but cases are growing. The psychological warfare waged by this virus has been overwhelming, both for patients and for health care providers. Patients are afraid of contracting and transmitting the virus. But health care workers, especially those used to a degree of predictability, seem to be susceptible to t
he stress of uncertainty and loss of control engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the declaration of the pandemic, we have had now several cases in our emergency department (_NAME_) of what I have referred to as “corona psychosis”. I present three brief cases here, afflicting a physician, nurse, and hospital custodial staff.

Just like how Wellbutrin was supposed to reduce yours. Wellbutrin is similar to ADHD drugs and is prescribed for off-label use. Strattera has similar mechanics to it in that it affects dopamine and norepinphrine. I wonder if it is because of too much anti-psychotics suppressing your dopamine in your case leading to negative symptoms. That’s why I am inclined to think boosting your dopamine and norepinephrine might help. I am only on 20mg dose, which is a sub-therapeutic dose for true ADHD. That’s because my psychiatrist is still worried putting too high of a dose would lead to psychosis."

With spirituality in particular, I feel that we, as schizophrenics, have something original to contribute, since our experience is something unique to this discussion, and cannot be replicated elsewhere, like on reddit. I for one have had experiences that I want to have the freedom to talk about, but this forum takes the decision to repress these whenever someone wishes to discuss them. Perhaps what is needed is a Sanity quarter. If you can display enough normalilty over recent posting history, then you can enter an area where you are free to discuss these issues. That way tiggering is avoided (although I must say that as a medicated patient, I do not ever experience this triggering, no matter what I read.) Perhaps what we can discuss in this thread is ways in which we can facilitate this discussion, without causing harm to others."

174352338,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in patients with schizophrenia during remission of positive symptoms. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain : a journal of neurology , Jun 2019 01 While there is consistent evidence for increased presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum of patients with schizophrenia during psychosis, it is unclear whether this also holds for patients during psychotic remission. This study investigates whether striatal dopamine synthesis capacity is altered in patients with schizophrenia during symptomatic remission of positive symptoms, and whether potential alterations relate to symptoms other than positive, such as cognitive difficulties. Twenty-three patients with schizophrenia in symptomatic remission of positive symptoms according to _PERSON_, and 24 healthy controls underwent 18F-DOPA-PET and behavioural-cognitive assessment. Imaging data were analysed with voxel-wise Patl
ak modelling with cerebellum as reference region, resulting in the influx constant kicer reflecting dopamine synthesis capacity. For the whole striatum and its subdivisions (i.e. limbic, associative, and sensorimotor), averaged regional kicer values were calculated, compared across groups, and correlated with behavioural-cognitive scores, including a mediation analysis. Patients had negative symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-negative 14.13 ± 5.91) and cognitive difficulties, i.e. they performed worse than controls in Trail-Making-Test-B (TMT-B; P = 0.01). Furthermore, kicer was reduced in patients for whole striatum (P = 0.004) and associative (P = 0.002) and sensorimotor subdivisions (P = 0.007). In patients, whole striatum kicer was negatively correlated with TMT-B (rho = -0.42, P = 0.04; i.e. the lower striatal kicer, the worse the cognitive performance). Mediation analysis showed that striatal kicer mediated the group difference in TMT-B. Results demonstrate that patients with schizophrenia 
in symptomatic remission of positive symptoms have decreased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, which mediates the disorder's impact on cognitive difficulties. Data suggest that striatal dopamine dysfunction contributes to cognitive difficulties in schizophrenia."

176041228,"This was written about my song on a songwriting forum: Hi _AT_MENTION_ ! I like the general idea of the song. It´s really touching, the vocal _NAME_ is really nice. I personally think the vocals need a bit more of work, there are some parts where I think you are losing a bit the intonation. But the timbre of your voice is quite sweet and deep, I really like it. Another thing I’ve noticed, is that, sometimes the guitar is fighting to much with the voice during the riff, and it does not sound great. I would reduce the sound of the guitar on that parts or take it out. Because it gives me the feeling of noise. I am meaning parts such as 1:00 - 1:03, or 1:10. Maybe it´s just a matter of getting a better mix. 1:34 to 1:40, I think the guitars are not really matching well the key or something, I like both the guitars and the vocal _NAME_, but somehow I don´t feel they are working there. Can you hear it? They are kind of fighting too much, imo. I think this tune requires a bit more of work, but this c

It also means your assailant can press assault charges against you and then you will need to hire a lawyer to defend you.

The findings offer a potential explanation for why different genetic changes can lead to the same behavioral traits, the researchers say. Deletions or duplications of stretches of DNA, or copy number variations (CNVs), in the chromosomal regions 16p11.2 and 22q11.2 are linked to both autism and schizophrenia, to varying degrees. Autism is more often linked to 16p11.2 deletions and 22q11.2 duplications, whereas schizophrenia is more often associated with 16p11.2 duplications and 22q11.2 deletions."

Given her motivation and happiness she never thought she’d achieve.

The world can feel cruel and can hurt us, but a lot of it is what we make it in our mind. We make a choice what to think about things and how to deal with them. Things can get better, but to convince the mind you have to let go of old ingrained thoughs and replace them with something else. Maybe something objective and reasonable."

174352355,"Well, I have a feeling I was told the stomach flu/virus (Norovirus) caused my schizophrenia/mental illness. I had it as a kid. I suffer from severe negative symptoms. I have a severe case of schizophrenia. Some people try to say I have bipolar or maybe even Aspergers too. I also think having no motivation is a sign of me having trauma and being afraid/terrified/scared. I believe I could have been a billionaire or something if I wasn’t targeted in college…but I digress. (On a side note: I think it would be good to delete and anonymize this account. I’ve been flagged by certain people here who don’t like me or what I say. I think I do suffer from some mild delusions but I think most of what I say is logically true and sound. I am a rational person. I messaged the admin a week or so ago and haven’t heard anything back. It might be possible for me to make a new account, but I want to protect myself). The reason why I’m telling you I think the Norovirus might cause some cases of schizophreni
a is because I want to help people. Nothing on google says anything about Norovirus and schizophrenia. They mentioned other viruses, but nothing close to it. Even if I take the pills (should be available in 1-2 years), there’s no evidence it would help me. I just want to try it because I think some of the damage is already done. My stomach is a mess from what I put in it so I bought some PB8 or w/e probiotics because when I took it a few years ago, it helped. I have thought that maybe I missheard them and they said it was some other similar virus, but I don’t think so. I have psychic visions and I remember taking some pills that were supposed to cure my schizophrenia in a past life/different worldline… I don’t remember much after that. I’m a super soldier or was in a past life…hence I was taken from my room at night like a lot of these so called super soldiers and was told this. I’m just telling people this because I want to help people. I would like some money too for what I’ve been through, 
but I’ve been largely ignored by everybody. I recently entered the bielefeld conspiracy competition and NOBODY WON! What a surprise!!! I thought I would definitely win or be one of the few people who would get it but I think it was a scam or marketing scam. A million dollars is a lot of money for something nobody on this planet can solve YET. I think in my lifetime, if I survive, I will be proven right, just like before, that we live in a fake reality called the matrix. It would be in a future and only I probably know this. Maybe one of the few on the planet. Even if we find out there will still be some people that can’t comprehend it or will get very angry and possibly violent because their minds or belief systems can’t handle it."

We always have a case or two of beer lying around. I think it’s a good sign that you still have that desire. I lost it. I think it means you still have some health left.

176041403,LS! Hi! It is great that you care about your health that much. I went on a CRON diet for three years almost 25 years ago. But this fasting mimicking diet lowers your sex and anabolic hormones. It is well known that oestrogen and testosteron and IGF1 are protective and make you live longer. There is the Caerphilly study that found the more sex the lower your risk of dying. Also protein and muscles seem to make one live longer. Do I look like I am going to be 63 this May?!

The problem is that my first appointment with my new doctor is still a few weeks away and they won’t prescribe my medications until they physically see me. I asked if they can give me an exception because I’ve only got a few days left of medications. They said it is illegal for them to prescribe meds without seeing me first and told me my previous doctor is responsible for my medications until I can be seen by them. I contacted my old doctor’s office and was told I am no longer allowed to send messages or contact my old doctor because I’m no longer a member as I no longer live within their “Service Area”. When I tried contacted their pharmacist’s direct line, they told me they could
n’t help me because I’m no longer a member. So am I hosed because nobody will see me to prescribe my usual medications before I run out? I feel like this kind of thing shouldn’t ever happen given how dangerous it can be. What if I run out of medication and get shocked into psychosis or end up trying to kill myself? They said to never stop taking it or that could happen. I’m honestly kinda scared because I haven’t been cut off from my meds before. Has anybody else had or even heard of a similar problem and know a way to get out of it? I guess this is what I get for trusting in our healthcare system. If I wouldn’t have taken those damn pills to begin with, I wouldn’t be in the predicament."

174352402,"I have bipolar I or II. I am sure it is bipolar I because my psychiatrist wrote “episodes of mania” despite my last “manic episode” occurring years ago. I have it with psychotic features. I was initially diagnosed with psychotic depression. As it turns out, I am not crazy “all of the time.” I have studied psychiatric illnesses and am well-versed with neuroscience because I find it fascinating. Sometimes I feel as if there is no way in hell that I suffer from psychosis because I can identify what is going on, but it is strange. I have awful paranoia that sometimes disables me and overwhelms me with anxiety. Other times, I still have those thoughts yet I do not care at all. I know that I am being delusional, yet I believe it. I cannot fathom this at all, so I need a second opinion. I know that imagining that there are ghosts preying on me, believing in invisible people, believing in mind reading, panicking when I hear my thoughts being spoken aloud, and many more are perhaps figments of m
y imagination and yet I believe them. I am insightful yet I believe it all. Is this impossible? Conversely, there are times when I completely believe my delusions yet some time after I have a moment of “reawakening” and I am capable of identifying the wrongs. I would not say that I am psychotic at the moment. All I do nowadays is have hallucinations and weird sensations that nothing is real. I am on aripiprazole so I guess I will be fine.

Not sure how long we were in hospital for and then in a home after that. Everyone in hospital should have people that good to them as he was to me. The other hospital stays people were good but we did not hang out much really just said hi as we walked past each other.

I did some stupid stuff, but I also had way more confidence way more energy more motivation to do things. If I could swap depression for mania I probably would. One is a state where I sit around all day feeling bad for myself and struggling to do basic things. The other is a state where I might start stupid arguments with people when I get bored, but generally I get more things done and feel happy most of the time."

174352449,"Sorry, noone causes schizophrenia on purpose. Voices inside your head will never be evidence for anything. There are rare cases when people turn psychotic after interaction with someone. The person who appears to cause the change never actually aimed or even imagined it possible. It is a biological vulnerability in the victim that is irritated basically randomly. Not a crime, not mind control, not magic."
176041653,This is a very unusual belief but I feel life has a pattern. And you may think I’m psychotic but I don’t think I am. I think when on a certain drug I like that I can see the pattern of life crystal clear as day. And my cognition has taken leaps and bounds of a jump. But I’ve always stayed true to myself besides pretending I were black. Which isn’t a big deal. Race is interchangeable because we are all human. But I never lied about anything else. I stayed true in other regards. And when you start lying about your age and stuff you create an alternative self and it conflicts with your real self. I can see this crystal clear as day sometimes. And I’m glad because I only faked my race which doesn’t effect me negatively in the long term. If I start lying about my age I become a different entity in a regard I don’t want. And my binge is over I ran out but not without me seeing that life is a mathematical equation/pattern. And I seriously could predict the future and talk to animals on this d
rug. I am feeling so incredible. And it makes me believe in my delusions when it helps me and it makes me not believe in them when it doesn’t help me. It is truly magical. And god has spoken to me many times on this drug. I don’t think it could be any more obvious at this point. I sound crazy but life is crazy. And when I was on this drug I felt I was on the same level as all y’all. Usually I am not on your guys level. I am not here. But ketamine gave me a boost and now I am on your guys level. I truly think it’s a miracle. And besides I don’t type anything since I’ve done this drug. The drug does the typing for me. So effortless. The flow/rhyme/rhythm of life is so apparent. I will return a bit. Just give me a few days. That was a huge binge I did. But in a way I will never forget these coincidences.

The antipsychotic treatment was brutal and shocking. I wish they had talked about it instead if drugging me. I am still in a state of braked dead shock many months later. Can’t get over the shock of hospital admission and aggressive treatment. Wish they’d left me alone to come out of it on my own without brutal hospital trauma. On my own it just recess after a few weeks or months and the aftermath trauma is not so shocking as it’s a gradual letting go and returning to sanity."

I have never heard god but I do hear schizophrenics, our conversations layered within the normal day to day noises. If you ever wondered why it feels like people are following you or laughing at you it’s because the voices put our thoughts/ words out into the public. Public spaces! Parks, shops, etc. These people say they are spiritual but they spend their days controlling the volume of noise… turning our most intimate thoughts or ones they have manipulated into a public joke.

174352468,"My first psychotic episode was 6 years ago and it was my only major one so far knock on wood As you probably know, it took a while for me to get back to my new normal. Working on my schizophrenia with a therapist has made me realize that I was also codependent in relationships. For the last 6 years I’ve been working on both. I can’t always control the schiz but I am doing GREAT at the codependency. However, it’s made me realize how messed up my marriage is. I have changed a lot of my behaviors but my husband is still his old self. I feel like recently I have made huge steps in being ok even if I’m alone and I’ve been really able to step back and look at things clearly. I honestly think he has an undiagnosed mental illness. Makes sense. He decided to be with a codependent who was still working on controlling schizophrenia (we were not married when I had my break) and a healthy person would have run. I have convinced him to get treatment so, for the next week I’m using ALL of my coping sk
ills to keep things calm until he gets to a doctor. He is not a physical threat to me just so you know. I really hope they can start him on the right track so he can get better like I am. We love each other very much so I know that we will always be in touch. I’m not certain the marriage will make it but that’s ok. He got me to doctors so I’ll get him to them and then life will go where it may. At least we will have been two ill people who left each other with a fighting chance for a healthy life and most likely a friendship of some sort for the rest of our lives. I really do feel ok about all of this. I just wanted to share."

176041737,"I think “mental illness” is too broad. It already encompasses so many other disorders. Changing it to such a broad name would hinder understanding of what we go through as schizophrenic people. I like “nondegenerative dementia” because people are familiar with dementia. They understand that it is something that should not be demonized or stigmatized. Schizophrenia used to be called something like premature dementia long long ago. I’d have to look up why the name changed but I like this association better. I think people think that schizophrenia sounds dangerous. “Nondegenerative dementia” doesn’t. Not to me. After all, it takes into consideration the cognitive struggles we have as well. People hear schizophrenia and they think hallucinations, voices and weird thoughts. But that’s not all this disorder is. It’s forgetting what someone just told you. It’s having trouble with logic. It’s needing more time to complete problem solving issues than the average person. It’s having 
disordered moods. It’s being confused a lot. It’s frequently misunderstanding the intentions of others… I think the word “dementia” does a better job at conveying all that. The “Nondegenerative” part differentiates the most important difference between Sz and dementia, that one is a mental illness and the other is medical. All around the best name IMO."

I know some of you mentioned cutting back hours but I need the full time hours and here when you work a shift you don’t go home when you’re scheduled shift ends, you stay until you get all of your work done. So cutting back can be hard. Plus it’s not so much the hours or the job itself, it’s the management. I cant do it anymore. I’m tired of feeling like I’m just being taken advantage of. I’m tired of doing extra work because lazy people complained so management lessened their workload and added it to the people who already work their asses off. I’m tired of the no communication and management just doing what they want without telling us and letting us run around confused. Today I found out that next week I have to work my normal shift, which is mainly showers and getting people ready, and I have to start another shift that’s mainly meds. It’s on a day that’s ridiculously busy for my nor
mal shift and now I have to work a second shift at the same time. It is only for a little bit but it’s also ridiculous. The girl that’s supposed to be working that shift said she cant come until half hour late. She has a history of saying she cant come in when actually can simply because she doesn’t want to get up that early. But she’s the bosses daughter so she gets away with it and her work is thrown on me now. I know a half hour doesn’t sound like much but it actually makes a huge difference so I’m gonna end up staying really late that day. I know I’m not coping with everything as well as I should. It’s worse than I like to let on and even admit to myself. So I’m just done. I’m angry, I’m upset, and I’m tired."

176041749,"I think it would be a good exercise for you to make some songs that are about different subject matter. Kind of like how _PERSON_ used to rap a lot about violence and drugs, but as he progressed, he focused more on mental health and his family."

176041753,Back when i was majorly psychotic during my first episode i terrified one of my good friends with stuff I talked about. But she had undiagnosed psychosis at the time too so she believed everything I talked about and that’s why she was so scared.

176041758,I have alot of difficulty remembering many things. My dang zodiac says that we have difficulty remembering things from the outside world. Seems it has always been a bit like that for me.

176041769,"Yeah, there are some delusional thoughts that were so real and traumatic for me that I still have them come back to me. they aren’t real events or happenings at all, but because they felt like they were real - I get caught up in hesitation as to whether or not to believe my mind or my insight.

176041785,My depot was delayed because I had a fever. I am getting it this Wednesday instead. Thing is I am getting thoughts to refuse to take it. I totally will take it but that little voice that suggests these things is a complete ???????. It seems determined to cause trouble. Just a few days ago I posted how manually messing with my own meds has only ever caused me grief but here I am considering it
176041786,Stereotype. A psychotiatrist in the hospital once told me that people w sz/sza generally have a low IQ. I think he said 70 is average. He said mine was around 120-130

176041793,"https://positivedisintegration.com I havent read a lot about it, but _PERSON_ wrote about desintegration of the ego in crisis. If i remember well, he says people with overexcitabilities of all kinds (e.g. heightened sensory or emotional sensitivity, as i understood it) often go through crises that they experience more deeply than others. He says their ego can be desintegrated, but it can also be a chance to build it up a new, and better even. Im planning to read more of it, but this is what i remember. Or on a lighter note: i felt like that too, and still somewhat, but it is possible to rebuild it. Yes."

176041801,A couple of months now
176041802,"You got to hand it to me I deserve an ‘E’ for effort. I’m more political (women’s feedback anyway) and less philosophical so I’ll keep that in mind. Read till the end but I’ve always felt more like a British Red Coat in the Revolutionary war, getting my head handed to me by Gueriila war fare. Heavy is the head that wears the crown(I know) and as a visage of all things majority it IS heavy at times in that way. Leaders or public figures have detractors. If you have enemies it means you stood up for something once in your life. (That’s _NAME_; for what it’s worth). But bear with me… this feeling is so severe that it’s akin to _NAME_ in Die Hard 3 when he’s (under duress) and is forced to wear a racist sign in a black community. I think just like the _NAME_ show, a lot of us with _PERSON_ recall that scene one way or another. (Just a theory of mine). Along that line do you ever think that _PERSON_ is part of the masculine side of the _PERSON_ and _PERSON_? It forces us to give up 
our position and ask the feminine to have a dance… (that’s still relevant today.). The burden of proof is on us. That resonates as a Sz. And I think that maybe men are divided and feel more alone which ironically in the latest Star Wars script says that’s how the empire prevails… just saying things are adversarial out there. Women aren’t going to hurt me for saying all this though. That’s a mans game. Still sometimes I’d like to put forth that men as an aggregate, are more scattershot along the spectrum of good and evil… or at least other separate positive takeaways. But I don’t feel like women allow that rationalization. I know community and tribes are smaller, but I’d like to know some more nurturing and less (you name it). Lastly a social worker(lady) said the feminine and masculine need to forgive one another. I guess that’s a good spot to end. (My previous published thoughts show I have a lot to say. But are we bridging gaps, and engaging in dialog? Because that would be respectful 
and feel more ‘Equal’ from the shoes I’m in, or if you need it, the bed I’ve apparently made in my life."
176041803,"The hospitals helped me start the right medication and while there I had reduced anxiety. I’m sorry your having issues with the anti-depressants, like Prozac. I think I heard Prozac has been used in anxiety as well. Sometimes the fact that most mental hospitals ask if “your a danger to your self”, or “your a danger to others”, really drove home the point that their for serious situations. I can understand how your depression may look like a drug problem. The lack of emotion and other symptoms seem like withdrawal oriented and may seem like withdrawal itself. I hope with time and medication you feel better."
176041804,"You’re right. They are big time haters and try to pass themselves off as positive minded saints. I’ve had housing problems too, and never did a thing. They make up so much bull crap, just to make themselves feel good. They’re mostly upset about not making my life gross enough."
176041805,"2 years after first psychosis. It started lifting like a fever breaking. I was on my meds the whole time, never went off them. I can only wish the same for other people. I still hallucinate though and I hate it, but I guess things can’t be perfect."

176041812,Math was the least cognitive ability affected by sz for me. _AT_MENTION_
176041813,Yes. It’s really hard. But so worth if if you can push through and gently exercise (like walking) and follow a heathy diet
176041814,"Just use the correct form of its/it’s/there’s/theirs and don’t spell lose with an extra o. Also, don’t add an apostrophe before the final letter of a plural noun for no reason. Those all really bug me to no end but I don’t correct anybody because I know they don’t like it. Honestly, I could care less about mistakes as long as those ones are avoided.

Stuff like alcoholism and anxiety. My mom told me I had a distant relative who could move objects with her mind but maybe I misheard her. Back then, maybe she wasn’t diagnosed with schizophrenia?"

174352501,Abilify doesn’t just increase dopamine it also reduces it when its high. Otherwise I would have psychosis
176041818,"Thanks for this question, I forgot a lot of the lessons already. I will have to revisit my notes I can visualize better. Objects, diagrams etc. I’m resilient af now, I was prepared for infinite pain, so daily problems don’t hit me that hard as they used to. I prepared for death in 4 different stages, first one was extreme fear second though guy “I’ll take one for the team, I ain’t scared of death”. Third stage was sadness, for all the things . And fourth acceptance, trying to take distance from all that I have/am. Grateful that I didn’t make it to step 5 actual taking distance from my physical body. I know now what I appreciate in life. The human connections and the experiences. I had no regrets only that I never traveled with a motorcycle. I had experiences that normal people can’t even dream of. Some wisdom was passed to me in that way. I learned to not explain everything to my head that my head already knows. Breaking through the thought loops. It’s difficult but I try to do it
. I learned about the power of words and the 4 toltec agreements. I made a codex with a list of words that defend me from “evil” thought. This codex then got used against me by the voices and in that way I have found that only acceptance helps, and people have to learn their own lessons through life, not be shown by others, only nudged in the right direction… Feeling like more of a person because I went through so much hardship. I’m still overcoming the faulty DNA thing but don’t believe it that much anymore. I think i got whacked with to many foreign chemicals through hardcore poly drug abuse in my teen years. Living by the lessons is another thing though…"

174352499,You can ask your doctor to try low dose thyroid medicine levothyroxine. Small dose will not do any harm even if your thyroid level is normal. Reason is levothyroxine improves dopamine and energy levels. When I reduce my levothyroxine dose I feel negative symptoms getting worse also feel so tired to do anything. No matter how much i sleep fatigue feeling not go thus tend to stay in bed all the time.

176041836,"If you want an audience you do have to cater to it. With something as complicated as human interaction… you can find as much direction from identifying what you should not do… instead of criticizing yourself for having a not-so-forward level of charisma. It’s actually hella respectable to not being an annoying persona. You may get overlooked and sometimes ignored. But if you’re not watering down people ears with whatever is on your mind then you are better off than you might expect. Beyond that… sociable people have a different perspective on things. It’s not so much about everyone else… they’re just playing around with what’s right in front of them… and they’re normally doing so with people they have already found compatibility with. There is an awkward divide of us and them… but it’s a blurred line. Don’t take it personally… Would you give up getting along with your friends for the sake of new person trying to wedge into the crowd? I feel for you in your struggles. T
his has been an issue for me throughout my entire life. That said I have made a lot of friends, most of whom i never talk to, that are out there. I’ve also found like minded folk that are more stabilizing as my own incompatibilities in life get me down… as those folk share in the same sense of difficulty and priorities… and just knowing that I’m not uniquely ?????? or anything like that takes the edge off the spite of being well to aware of the whole scenario… but that’s just me. i don’t like groups… i don’t like socialites… or wanna be socialites… their concerns are hard to trust.

She prescribed abilify, a low dose at first then after 72 hours lower the haldol and raise the abilify. She said the abilify is a last ditch effort if it doesn’t work then we will look into genosight testing. My worries is what if I’ve already tried the med that genosight testing recommends"

176041861,image.jpg 3024×4032 2.05 MB _AT_MENTION_ posted an article that it was more effective then the lamp in the wintertime for seasonal effective disorder. Well in April I tried stopping it but i got bad mood symptoms even then. So I’m hooked on this I think I may have a deficiency and it’s definitely especially effective in wintertime but helps me all seasons it seems. My doctor said things like this can help depression. Maybe I’m wrong for recommending it considering it’s the summer equinox but it’s really helped me it’s been pretty surprising
176041862,"i think so, because i miss the money, even though i prefer my current life, with all my free time. if i made another $700-$800 dollars in ssdi i would stay out of the work force. im debating on wether or not to go back to work full time or part time. i might as well choose full time work, although i would have a really busy schedule, to be able to garden, and workout each day. wouldn’t have enough free time to play guitar or watch a ballgame or movie at night. im waiting for the covid wave to die down before i start putting in applications."
174352506,"Clozapine is better for Schizoaffective than it is Schizophrenia. It’s better for mania than it is for depression. I think Clozapine is a thousand time better than Risperdal.

176041870,"I suffer from paranoia and delusions. They affect me differently at different times. At home I think my neighbors are purposely bothering me and I don’t trust them much and it can upset me. At work the paranoia is more under control, I get along with most people. I still have delusions, I misinterpret many situations and some of my thoughts and ideas can get pretty out there.

176041882,_AT_MENTION_ interesting… i was wondering how you are able to profit off your fine arts work or career? _AT_MENTION_ yes i went to college for 1 year and got a certificate in html coding or web development but never pursued it afterwards. i took a class in programming a few years ago but was like 4/5 the way done before i got ill and had to stop. _AT_MENTION_ yea i am also concerned that my racing thoughts and symptoms would return if i tried to go to the average workforce or get a min wage job etc. plus when i get put on the spot and people start expecting things from me like showing up on time thats when i get even more stressed out and cant sleep good and that makes going into work and being at work and getting things done a lot more difficult.
176041883,"Friendship takes upkeep. You have to put in the time and work. IDK what’s up with your friends. Having friends comes naturally and there’s no need to overthink it but all I can think of is to make some kind of gesture showing you value them as friends and want to be around them. I don’t know what the gesture should be but something friendly. I’ve had friends turn on me before, I’ve had best friends cut me out so I know what it feels like. It lasted for awhile then we became friends again."

Ive been bullied and staff have done nothing about it. But Ive seen bullies get blamed for stuff they haven’t done too. I dont believe in justice anymore especially in institutes that claim they are just trying to educate lol
176041888,"I think so… Thanks for the insight though. I will read more about it! At this moment i have less real bad fats (cookies and cakes and Turkish pizza etc) but relatively much fats still (e.g. meat, fish, full fat dairy). I will look into it."
176041889,"I had hopes to set up a new workout video and wash my hair. But alas… Nope. Did some mom stuff. Rides. That alone maxed me out. We did get out for a family hike in nature today which if I had to pick one thing to do, that one is the best."
176041890,"I find turning the tv on to a local station helps with loneliness. I would also find some people who can look out for you. Maybe a clubhouse? Maybe a good case manager or therapist you meet with regularly? Going to support groups or church? Getting a peer specialist? I go out during the day so I only ever deal with demons at night or in the mornings when my parents are gone. But routine also helps. Maybe cook breakfast then go out for a walk or to clubhouse, go grocery shopping and visit the library, come home and turn on the tv and make dinner and do chores, call or text someone you know before going to sleep. Or if you’re really feeling lonely at night, and it’s safe, go out at night for a drive or a walk??"
176041891,"this is a major problem, playing around with meds. I would suggest green tea for fat burning."

176041894,"Just got back from the doctors after finishing my second episode of psychosis. Will stay on 10mg Olanzapine for six months and then with all being well I will be able to try and stop antipsychotics again. All of the same stress triggers were in place for both psychosis, so hopefully if I can manage these I’ll get another chance at being medication free! Was expecting to be on medication for life, as is the view on here. And a diagnosis of schizophrenia. I’m not out of the woods yet but hopefully all will go well."
176041895,"Also, the medication isn’t making me sleepy anymore. It is harder to fall asleep now. I will need to ask my doctor if the dose can be increased."

176041900,I’ve been multi episodic with recurrent depression and voices etc. My psychosis symptoms were on and off but my mood swings were more disabling. Came off meds in 2007 but five years later had another breakdown and had to return to meds. Since then each time I tried to reduce my meds I got ill. It’s hard feeling like a fake.
174352524,"What is new in this report ? It is a new treatment that do not blocking dopamine D2 receptor,so that it avoid causing the famous bad side effects As usual it is reduces the severity of the symptoms like all other medicines,and does not lead to a sustainable final cure from the sz’s tragedy The questions What does it mean that the drug targets the receptors ,not the transmitters ? Why does blocking the receptor function become a means to correcting the mechanisms of change/ disorder that precedes the symptoms and cause ? Mainly,what is different between the function of transmitter / receptor in the pathway of the higher mental processes ? And, where is the defect in the higher mental process that is responsible to induce the symptoms ? Is the defect in transmitter signal OR in the receiving process of the signal in the receptor ?"
176041901,"I am sorry I sounded against meds. I am not against them, cause I take them. Maybe I am not sz, that’s all. But I know people who are not sz and they are helped by aps too. Its just not my case. I never lost touch with reality in fact. I never had voices. I have other bad stuff… My state is not by episodes, it’s chronical… But I am very unhappy since kid. I also even had problems talking and walking… My mom says sometimes I could be autistic… I have problems thinking. I think, but I have the impression of being dumb… It feels like I lack oxygen in my brain if I can say it so… I feel my brain in my head, which is impossible, but I focus on my brain yeap… Whatever. I am a bit different here I know… Oh yes, its hard also to never have positive emotions as I do… So that’s why I was thinking that I need smth else besides the meds. I know, my sz friends are relatively fine if they take their meds. But not me. I am here cause I found friends here and my isolation is heavy…i am qu
ite lonely in irl… I hope I’ll continue having friends here . I feel like I want to cry now… It’s something to be a no lifer since 25 years …"

174352526,"Invega was a super heavy medication for me since I started off on the highest dose. I was only allowed to lower it to 156mg after about 6 months. I am thankful the Doc put me on it at first because it brought me out of a long psychotic break. I have changed antipsychotics a number of times since then because of flat affect, anhedonia and depression(as described by my Psychaitrist). I don’t know if I have ever been as depressed as I was on Invega with the exception of before my diagnosis. So to answer your question…Yes and No. My suggestions would be, I would give it a chance to work since everyone reacts differently 2) Work with your Psychiatrist to try to find an antidepressant that may help you. 3) Maybe see if your depression clears if they decide to lower your dose. 4) My depression finally lifted a lot when I started to exercise daily so that may help some.(even on Invega) 5) Only surround yourself with positive people. I guess it is really difficult to distinguish between negative symptom
s, in my case, and depression. I only know I have suffered with both. Good Luck and I hope Invega works well for you!! Just my uneducated 2 cents for the little it is worth…"
176041904,Making it illegal doesn’t get rid of the problem. Cocaine is a good example of a drug that gets cut on the black market with other stuff and makes it more dangerous. Cocaine is not the best drug to me. But making any drug illegal. Except maybe fentanyl. Which is semi legal I think …I just think the drug war is an utter failure. U know the Schpeel. Waste of tax payers money. Throw addicts in rehabs not prisons.

and causing all of them without exception , and there is no any other condition,factor or cause responses about anything of these symptoms This means that “the Schizophrenia” is just a name ,while the hallucination (the thing you call it psychosis) is the active condition whereas there is an actual existence of it inside the basic nature of the person -nothing else ! Without we saying that the Sz is a genetic disease or other; Genetic treatment remain the First means of treating the bad side symptoms that the hallucination creates It cannot denied that all aspects of improvement that occurs to the person in several weeks after using the medical intervention IS sufficient to maintain the continuation of the biological life ,Until you find a way to treat the bad side changes that occurred in concept of the self-knowledge data or/ the personal acquired culture in the mental aspect ,because the drugs are unable to modify these malicious changes !"

176041920,I go to bed early like 7pm but I read and listen to the radio and set an alarm for 5 am. I don’t think it matters much if your in a good routine. Whether your a night owl or not do physical things like exercise when your awake and take the pills same time everyday. We are all different and all I worry about is sleeping about 8 hours a day.

I was on 3mg for several months, then I started having real bad depression with suicidal thoughts. My doc raised my dose to 4.5mg and in about three days the thoughts were gone.

176041988,Don’t do it. Weed is no fun anymore now that I have psychosis. I had to learn that the hard way.
176041989,Call them up and ask them. I’ve never liked hospitals but sometimes going into one is a necessary evil. Some people think being hospitalized isn’t that bad. I think it is. I mean some people like talking to the other patients and making friends and think the food is good and feel safe. I usually kept to myself but I always had a few people who liked me which always surprised me. I don’t go into a hospital until I am at the end of my rope and ten minutes from going screaming mad or having a complete meltdown and implosion. But that’s just me. Other people do a pre-emptive strike and go in when they’re feeling bad but still feel in control. They go in for a tune-up and for rest and get their medication adjusted. I think those people are smarter and do the right thing by going in early.

How long we live, despite popular opinion, has mostly to do with genetics instead of lifestyle. (Lifestyle can effect this some)."

I never dreamed that I would have sz someday when I got pregnant at age 19. As soon as my child was born, I knew that I was in over my head and I swore I would never get pregnant again.

176042003,"I feel like the depression thing is kind of trendy now. The way people talk about having depression is like they just think it’s just being sad about something. This is what I see as the trendiness, people all saying they suffer from depression who really just want to celebrate that they sometimes get sad. I don’t think it’s trendy to be raw about it and talk about how you would like to blow your brains out. Then again maybe I lack the empathy that everyone must have. Depression isn’t something I feel is particularly happy to talk about, that is why I don’t understand those with a desire to talk about it. I like to keep people who are happy as still happy and not bring them to a depressing state."

176042008,"Well, look, I’ve battled depression. I cant say I overcame it but I’ve damn near improved over the years. First of all, anyone who tells you to just get out of bed and do something is a total fck-face, ignore them. Try to think of something that interests you. Maybe it’s getting a cup of coffee in the morning, or going for a drive, or playing a video game, or reading a book. In my eyes, the cure for depression, more so the ability to manage it, is to build hobbies. Try to find something that you enjoyed doing. Like I said, even if it’s just a small thing like grabbing a cup of coffee in the morning. Hope this helps, hang in there."

Then, I threw it all together in a large, glass casserole dish with a lid and stirred it up and Voila! Dinner! Dish out a cup of it and top with a bit of Kikkoman soy sauce and there you got it.

Deadlift variations—I would like to learn some of those, as they can really help. All you need imo is the big 3 lifts (barbell deadlift, barbell squat, flat bench press) in order of importance. The farmer’s walk is special too, it activates every part of the body. One important thing for me is digging up some decent channels w/good information on youtube, as well as well put together scientific websites.

176042107,"I’m up. Yesterday my managers didn’t tell me what time to come into work so I came in the time I usually was scheduled that was 3-11 and then found out they had randomly put me down for 7-3. They claimed they texted me but I received no text. It took forever to finally get in touch with one to figure out what time I was working today, Sunday. They signed me up for 7-3 again. So I got home at 1 am last night from my shift and then had to wake up at 4:30 today for work lord"
176042108,Did you hear my thoughts i had about you. Cause you can only hear them when i let you so appreciate it.
174352564,I’m still working on gaining insight.One part of me thinks the schizophrenia diagnosis is an exageration ( I was first diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder).It’s hard.
176042109,"I usually listen to an audible book for an hour off the echo show. And if i cant sleep i pay 2 quid a month for an _USER_ID_ app called “sleep jar” which plays stuff like rain storms to city sounds among others for 10 hours. It helps stop the voices creeping in when im in bed - gives the mind something to focus on. sleepjar.com Sleep Jar™ - Sleep Sounds & Ambient Noise Sleep Jar™ plays ambient sounds to help you sleep, relax, meditate, or focus."

176042111,my voices are in my head as well as out of my head… i heard them talking about me and directly to me and like giving comments on what was going on or what was going to happen and they also commanded me to do things.
174352563,"I had a therapist who kept blaming me for my negative symptoms, I told her to fk off and to never call again as she was stressing me. She didn’t call again."
176042112,oh i see & thanks for considering me but to tell you the truth i have many flaws in me that i have conquer haha but i am nice person when you get to know & again thanks
176042113,I felt like that last week. The feeling passed though. I hope it’s only a temporary feeling for you too.

176042121,"I can relate! I just started a new job after working in sales for 4 1/2 years. The difference being I have a lot (a ton!) more co-workers. We’re all jammed in this mini warehouse and having sza and gad spells trouble for me at times. Remember to know ambivalence; meaning it’s not a question of being liked 100% or disliked 100%. For me, as long as I’m a nice guy who gets nervous-- it is what it is. Sounds like your ears are giving you the most trouble. My ears listening to me speak gives me the most angst. Sometimes I am able to luck my way into thinking positively. I keep searching for myself when I talk… only way I can ‘turn the tide.’ I’m off to work, good luck!"
176042122,"Yes, 10 years, I think. And yes, it was first-episode psychosis. You have an impressive memory."

176042126,I used to be pretty but now I’m old and ugly
176042127,Planning to go after Christmas shopping tomorrow. I wish I can go with someone.
176042128,_AT_MENTION_ It’s a battle combining exercise with a binge eating disorder. As a teen in the summertime I would exercise 6 hours a day and eat and eat and purge. It was awful. Had my mom not gotten sick and died I think I might have been normal. I was normal until she got sick.
176042129,"You can’t hear thoughts. Nothing can. They’re not even sound, they’re tiny electrical impulses so nothing can “hear”"
176042130,I faint on Geodon if I try to get up too fast when I wake up in the morning . I have to be careful. The doctors call it syncope and collapse. They will probably do an MRI on you. They did for me. At least a CAT scan. Does it just happen randomly or if you do a certain thing? I just have to lie in bed a few minutes in the morning before I try to get up or I hit the floor.
176042131,"The birds and the bees is not a myth, they genuinely are the ones that breed us having been around since prehistoric times. But the bees are dying out owing to what? I’ve heard someone use the word “insectoid” in reference to evil. This is too general a term. Wasps and flies feed on carrion and turd. We’ll talk about the dragons later."
176042132,I think your answer is gold. Thank you I told someone for the first time yesterday and she said doing it gives me space to do something for myself
176042133,"Doctor is always knocking us out or numbing an area to avoid pain. The trouble is, if you’re numb, you don’t know when you’re getting hurt."
176042134,"I have no contacts with friends for over 10 years now and have no problem in fact contacts is actually a problem as its difficult to keep in contact with them regularly, need to pick up their calls and respond all seems so hard to maintain. Also they will ask to meet in real, come to home etc and thats a huge stress generating one for me as i have ocd and i don’t want them to contaminate."
176042135,Okay I just wondered
176042136,That’s very good that u r keeping track …wish I cud be like that too
176042137,Feel better _AT_MENTION_ they will work on meds when your in there and you’ll be out in no time! Good luck and don’t despair!
174352570,"I (and my doctor) just are sure that i had withdrawals from quitting antipsychotics (not only psychosis, also other issues). Might be that i also would have developped psychosis without meds, might be i wouldnt…nobody can really know. My diagnosis is not schizophrenia. I know im much more sensitive to psychosis, anger, insomnia and mood swings the first few weeks after lowering the dose. I dont know if i can ever fully withdraw from meds, but i know i have to be more careful right after lowering the dose."
176042138,"According to Wikipedia: “A one-tablespoon (5 grams) serving of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80–175 mg, studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.”"
176042139,In DID you are unaware of the personalities. Since you are aware of personality changes it will be likely some form of bipolar.

176042143,Yes long term consumption of alcohol matters too and so does quantity.
176042144,I had a delusion for years that I thought I was speaking to and seeing the people who fought these battles. They used to make me draw their memories

174352576,"I got in five hours of regularly interrupted sleep. I have to take my Saphris a little later than usual because I’m going to head off to an eval for an outpatient program in a little while, so I need to be alert. I am stressed that I won’t be able to get the house clean and the cookies/ desserts baked today."
176042151,"I had a dream, but I think it was heavily influenced by my parents. I wanted to be a doctor, specifically a psychiatrist. I wanted to be the very best, too. Then I started going down hill and got sick in my third year of medical school. I have now lost my dream and all I want to do is keep my job in data entry and make the little bit of money to pay for my car, my bills, and eating out now and then. Not only do I lack a dream but also I lack any ambitions for the future. I dread the future when I will retire and be bored all the time. If I have any dream it is to be a good patient and serve in that capacity."
176042152,"No one is inside your body, that’s impossible."

174352577,you sound like a nurse.
176042154,"Alright, this has gone far enough. If you threaten to cut or kill yourself over not getting the replies you want again, I will suspend you. You have been warned.

176042156,I know. I was so stupid when I had a Camaro. I think I rarely changed the oil.
174352575,abilify didn’t make me very tired when I took it. But I only took it for 2 months. I had to stop taking it because it gave me tardive dyskenisia. I just know that the rexulti counteracts some of the sleepiness from the saphris that I take twice a day. The dose I take at night knocks me clean out. The dose I take in the morning with rexulti I can usually stay awake and still function somewhat normally without too much drowsiness. Of course it depends on your body chemistry. But it might be worth a try becuase rexulti and abilify are cousins and if you’re stable on abilify you might have some luck on rexulti and who knows it might be less sedating for you. 8 years is a long time to suffer with side effects. I hope you find some relief soon. Good luck.
176042157,"I live in my own apartment with my dog and pay all of my regular bills and do shopping on my own but I receive housing assistance to help pay rent and receive some food stamps. I own my own car and pay my insurance on it every 6 months. I lived with my mom until my mid-30s and could never go back to that lifestyle of being so dependent on someone else. Still, my parents sometimes put a little money in my checking account each month to get me thru til pay day, but they do it from 5000 miles away which works well for all of us."
176042158,Don’t worry your nightmares are not reality. You are safe. Maybe have a nice calming tea like a herbal one with no caffeine. I used to get awfully disturbing nightmares I feel for you. I hope it gets less and less with time…
176042159,"I cried when i got my diagnosis. Id been suffering for 4 months, off my head not knowing whats going on. I full on cried all over the psychiatrist. Got weaned on risperadone - and promptly went to bed for 4 days."

176042162,"Yeah, well they were talking about religion so I understand. But nonetheless I feel like my presence there wasn’t valuable enough. They probably didn’t think anything of it and didn’t mean it. I’m not even in this university anymore and now I’m questioning if it is ok to participate in this group."
176042163,Thankyou Wave
176042164,It’s most likely the APs you are taking
176042165,I’ll be able to work today. Just taking a post meal break.
174352590,Great job. I was tracking the prostate cancer pipeline. Put my report into a free website at sites.google.com . Then I would update the free website and link to it. Example: free pipeline website example
176042166,Be in nature. Walk in the park or on the beach or in a forest. Look at the stars or the clouds. Visit a zoo or animal sanctuary. Get a pet. Do gardening. _USER_ID_. Anything in nature that you like and that soothes you.
176042167,"Yeah same here, things go in waves. In fact, I am a little paranoid right now. I’m afraid people will misunderstand me when I make jokes."
176042168,I cancelled mine - and the others. I wasnt watching half of them. and the credit cards moaning lol. If they do me an offer i might get it back tho.
176042169,I’ve done some things in my life to my sister in particular that I’d like to get back and do over again. I was a shitty brother for a long time. Yeah some of it was the sz but I didn’t get diagnosed till I was 29. I lived with her in a share house in everything and I really was a bad brother. I can relate totally and I am glad I’ve rebuilt those bridges. It’s never too late even if you come to terms with it yourself!
176042170,I’ve survived worse.
176042171,"My guys, I think I’m going to talk about going to the hospital to my doctor so I can get better faster and not do anymore stupid stuff; almost precautionary in going."
176042172,"I do want to thank you all. I’m pretty much stuck trying to figure this out myself and just don’t know how much more I can actually give. Therapy is going to be off the table for some time, and probably forever. As I mentioned but over 2 years ago is where the decline started with the 1 year mark starting to rapidly decline (fall 2019) and I have yet to be able to maintain a job this whole time and it just happened again… with my first actual career move and “excited” to do and that I couldn’t even make that work. So I’ll never have the money for, or insurance to help. I do understand I have legal protections but for my whole life I’ve waived those. Personal decision. I want to be treated like everyone else, as I believe in equal opportunity, not equal outcome. I should not be put on a higher pedestal because of my conditions, to me that’s wrong… I understand I can’t exactly do that and to move forward, yes I need to certainly take responsibility for what I am, not doing that 
would be detrimental… however I know I can’t put that all on myself as I genuinely cannot help it. Thats certainly one of the larger struggles for me, admitting to myself I’m not in complete control. I for once took that step forward with my now previous job, to me it made it worse at minimum if I put all cylinders thinking about it it might of helped, I’m incapable of knowing anyway. All i know of a situation is what I think. I can usually work towards a more realistic answer that’s not just “Ooga booga everyone hates and is out to get you” They made it difficult to find, and I still can’t see anything else. The parent company yes but not where I worked they barely showed the slightest bit of care or empathy We will see where this goes. I’m here for support after all (for myself) (oh I know evil ??????? me!! Ban him!!) and maybe can find some trust somewhere, if anything right now it’s just being heard, that’s quite a long road to there… whatever I’m doing issint working although I
ve made some strides in some areas thats minuscule. I don’t even yet understand how I’ve even got here or am here. I don’t have a tragic sob story to share, life’s been okay, not great or terrible. Even the main issue impacting me that I can see, is okay bad, but not worthy of constant torture. So hey we will see. That’s something I’d like to post, probably a different thread as this already clouded up enough and best to stay focused. But think it would be valuable to get some extra external input."

176042176,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ it is totally gone now. Luckily I was an inpatient at the time so got good care. But for a month post discharge I still couldn’t walk properly. I got worried it might be permanent. _AT_MENTION_ antibiotics can totally interact with APs. It needs an experienced doctor to pick up on it though. Sorry you suffered

176042207,"I guess I have to try harder and attempt to rebuild my life after ‘what happened’ to me. Basically, I have false memories and delusions, but I just feel like it’s hard sometimes. Like I feel damaged and trapped and scared and disabled and the lot. But I don’t know. I embarassed myself and said a lot of stupid things over the years, but I felt obligated and had to. I definitely regret some stuff but I don’t know. If I didn’t, my dissociation would have been still here and then maybe I would have ended my life a lot earlier or something. I changed whether willingly or by force. I don’t know. All I know is I changed. Some darkness still resides in me but I also found light and hope."

176042222,"So I’ve basically worked on through all 4 of my psychoses. Going in to the office almost everyday, etc. It was after maybe a month or two of hospitalisation each time that I returned - and I was still pretty deep in my psychosis each time. It’s really hard to shake a lot of those beliefs that form and takes years to get rid of them (if at all). And I carried those beliefs with me as I attempted to perform a variety of different senior management / sales / “knowledge worker” type roles over my time. At my first place of work, I had my first psychosis. I had no idea what was happening. I did not seek treatment. I didn’t have any dellusional beliefs persay but was extremely confused, unable to make sense of things and had this extremely strong drive to read the meaning behind everything people were telling me, as opposed to taking it all on face value. Which distracted me from basically being able to digest almost anything people were telling me. It felt very much like acid/LSD but I hadn’
t taken anything and it lasted months (and longer). I don’t think anyone realised fully that I was ill but rather thought I was just being lazy or something. I wasn’t really treated any differently by anybody at this point. My second and third psychosis were during my time at a ubiquitous and very well-known tech company. I got myself hospitalised after feeling the episode build up over about a month - until I stupidly did hallucinogens (whilst feeling off) and was thrown in to a full on and deep psychosis. Regardless, I went to work on the Monday and lasted a day before taking myself to hospital. Throughout the time I was feeling funny, it mainly surfaced as a paranoia about my girlfriend and best friend + this arsehole at work who I felt was bullying me through sub-text and weighted words (spoke to a number of people in later jobs who confirmed that he had been an arsehole to them). But directly before the weekend where it got out of control (partially due to the drugs) on the Thursday or Friday - this 
guy basically turned to me (whilst I was already hyper-paranoid). And said to me “Are you CIA? The Chief Risk Officer, [Insert Name Here] is Ex-Israeli Intelligence”. Which totally messed me up (and was aggrevated by other things that I thought he had said or done. I thought it was dellusion, until I validated with another employee there that the guy whose name he had told me WAS the chief risk officer and he was ex-israeli intelligence. Further googling led me to the discovery that my employer had acquired another company that had designed some kind of risk management software, and that company was all run by ex-intelligence. So it wasn’t just the CRO. (Note all of this validation happened whilst I was in psychosis, but I repeated my validation once I had recovered and confirmed its accuracy). Furthermore - years later, whilst out of the psychosis I basically called the arsehole and confronted him about it and he confirmed that he “might” have said exactly that, but if he did it would have been int
ended as a joke… That same guy had secured (as his first job out of uni) a gig for a not-for-profit whose goal was spread democracy through old Russia (also validated - its still on his LinkedIn profile). And had told me stories about stuff like buying jet fuel off of some shady looking russian dude in the back of a pub so that they could fly to this place that was a while away (can’t validate this without calling him again and I don’t want to / am not going to do that). Following that psychosis and the one that followed it within the same company - Sure, Yes. People did treat me differently. Do I wonder why? Do I feel particularly hard done by because of it? Not really… It’s kind of obvious. People don’t want to deal with things that they do not understand. And they also possibly jump to conclusions about your behaviour and might assume the worst (although this last interpretation is just a guess based on observations whilst in psychosis - so not that reliable). Same deal at my next employer. Was 
treated normally (quite well actually). Until I had a psychosis, after which their behaviour changed."

176042228,It’s because of those who leave early. Big percentage keeps the years down but we’ve better meds these days and those studies are in progress with our generation. I’d imagine you’d see a lot more information to the positive with the newer medications. We aren’t totally removed from the dark ages of psychiatry. It’s like the difference between males and females for life expectancy. You lose more men earlier in car crashes and other risky behaviors so females usually have a better life expectancy in the modern world.

I’m also implanting false memories into my mind of having had more of a fulfilling sex life than I actually had, by imagining sexual encounters and saying to myself ‘That really did happen’."

However, no _NAME_-analysis has been conducted.To examine the prospective relationship between PA and incident anxiety and explore potential moderators.Searches were conducted on major databases from inception to October 10, 2018 for prospective studies (at least 1 year of follow-up) that calculated the odds ratio (OR) of incident anxiety in people with high PA against people with low PA. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A random-effects _NAME_-analysis was conducted and heterogeneity was explored using subgroup and _NAME_-regression analysis.Across 14 cohorts of 13 unique 
prospective studies (N?=?75,831, median males?=?50.1%) followed for 357,424 person-years, people with high self-reported PA (versus low PA) were at reduced odds of developing anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]?=?0.74; 95% confidence level [95% CI]?=?0.62, 0.88; crude OR?=?0.80; 95% CI?=?0.69, 0.92). High self-reported PA was protective against the emergence of agoraphobia (AOR?=?0.42; 95% CI?=?0.18, 0.98) and posttraumatic stress disorder (AOR?=?0.57; 95% CI?=?0.39, 0.85). The protective effects for anxiety were evident in Asia (AOR?=?0.31; 95% CI?=?0.10, 0.96) and Europe (AOR?=?0.82; 95% CI?=?0.69, 0.97); for children/adolescents (AOR?=?0.52; 95% CI?=?0.29, 0.90) and adults (AOR?=?0.81; 95% CI?=?0.69, 0.95). Results remained robust when adjusting for confounding factors. Overall study quality was moderate to high (mean NOS?=?6.7 out of 9).Evidence supports the notion that self-reported PA can confer protection against the emergence of anxiety regardless of demographic factors. In particular, higher PA levels 
protects from agoraphobia and posttraumatic disorder."

176042351,In my experience delusions don’t tend to stop. They are either replaced by other delusions or your meds work well enough to where your logic overpowers your gut and you are able to say “yes I have those beliefs but they are most likely just a delusion”

176042358,"There’s kernels of truth in our sickness, or at least(our Paranoia), according to something I got out of a book. But do ever think that maybe you’re sabotaging yourself at times? I think sometimes that having a thick conscience can create self hate in some, which creates an unhealthy relationship with pain, and that in turn makes us susceptible to power struggles with others. I’m projecting the bejesus out of myself, I know. Still something that seems novel is trying to understand people who string together unpopular things. Instead of calling them haters, terrorists, etc. I won’t boycott you; personally I may have benefitted from “Sensitivity Training” once in my career… And I like that you’re writing things down - we have that in common. But you’re an outlier here and maybe what’s known as an extremophile? Either way you probably need help; and deserve it deep down."
174352619,"Some other odd things that have happened to me: When I was in the hospital, I had a visible menu in my head where there was written the phone number of a local radio station. I saw a person in the hospital who seemed to be under some sort of psychosis and wrote the name of that same radio station and its frequency. When I was in another hospital I (or the “spirit” controlling my body) was pacing in the corridor, a man out of nowhere came up to me and said: ""Jesus said: “The spirits of the aliens”. "". I had fake thoughts immediately reminding me of my situation where I am apparently possessed by an “alien spirit”, and wondering how the man could possibly know my situation. Also, to my knowledge, Jesus never said anything about “the spirits of the aliens”. One day I heard a train horn right after waking up (there are railways nearby where I live), and before that I got an inserted thought that I’m going to hear a train horn; an inserted thought after that claimed that I caused the 
train driver to blow the horn, because I’m a god One day when I was heading home (the “spirit” was controlling me again, and had my eyes stare at the sky all the time while walking, for some reason), a man on a bicycle stopped and started screaming at me for no reason. No words came out of his mouth, just screaming several times. Later the fake thoughts came in claiming that I was causing him to scream at me, since I am a god. All odd coincidences or hallucinations? One theory of those fake thoughts is that I’m a severely limited demigod, and the deity is under the control of the same process that controls the voices or/and the fake thoughts, in effect making them the god instead. At the same moment I supposedly became demigod this “schizophrenia” arrived to take control over me, and supposedly this control will persist after death in the form of torture. Apparently someone does not want gods popping up all over in the universe. According to the voices/fake thoughts their ultimate plot is to tortu
re me endlessly after death, and make me believe that I’m a god and causing this torture upon myself, with no way out of it. Some time ago (and recently also) they’ve been saying to me that I’m supposed to be a god and it’s my own fault I haven’t escaped from this “schizophrenia”. While in the hospital, I had different mystical theories presented in my head by the fake thoughts, and dialogues between “fake me” and fake thoughts. All of them reasoned why I should be tortured after death endlessly."

I would lament my old group, and I’m still looking for one like it. But I’m still trying, and I’m finding a new group that I’m growing to like in different ways. Your children will always be in your life, maybe not as much now a days, but they will always love you. Longing for a home is strong. But we need to use that longing into a positive, and try to build a new home that’s healthier for us. Housing my be an option, get you your own apartment. And I’ve started over from scratch a few times, cut my loses and walked away. Sometimes that takes more strength than staying. I’m wishing you well my foliage friend."

I knew there is a side effect of APS where your tongue may roll out involuntarily , but instead i am rolling back , but out and i am not on APs and when i press the back of my head ( like massaging), i can feel there are some contraction of the nerves around the tongue and the jaw. I just found that it maybe relatad to the 12 pairs of cranial nerves and mine maybe problems of the Glossopharyngeal nerve and the vagus nerves . I just want to know if anyone also share the same problems or have similar experience and how u deal with that? i think that’s what make me think schizophrenia maybe a problem of virus infection because i can feel the abnormal feeling and it may be due to viral infection of the nerves , who knows?"

Whether my husband is delusional or not, it’s got nothing to do with me anymore. I want out of the relationship anyway. I’m tired of my husband’s strange beliefs.

Really if you have sz there’s no need to do lsd. Lsd kind of induces schizophrenia, as a temporary affect. Psychiatrists in the 50s took it and checked themselves into psych wards to learn to empathize with their patients. I took shrooms in 2014 on abilify and it was maybe the 2nd worst day of my life ;). Or at least top ten worst. It really messed me up. The next year and a half was such crappiness. If you’re seeking a high, I dunnno what I can say without breaking rules here. If it’s a spiritual journey and personal growth development enlightenment experience you’re looking for, I’d say you can find that more in being healthy Acid and antipsychotics was the least fun drug combo I ever did next to shrooms and abilify.

176042458,"I know what you mean. A lot of strange stuff in the future dreams. _PERSON_ call that “Dreamwalking” and new agers call it “astral projection” while some people will just call it high insight or hyper-intelligence? or maybe just fixation on out there beliefs? Not sure what scientific minded people call that. I think that we all carry some element of the collective consciousness, but are free to participate or pretend it doesnt exist. Like there are people who don’t want to believe in God, and others who do. Just because I believe in God doesn’t mean you have to. Just like you are free to reject my other beliefs and experiences, but I think psychiatry has done too much to call people a label that literally means insane or that what you perceive isnt real. Some aspects of schizophrenia are delusions and hallucinations. But to the person in the midst of the psychotic episode it feels real to them. Like, a shroom or acid trip, it feels real and the world around us reflects it and then it st
ops. The more I think about it the more I wonder if the world itself isnt charged by a secret invisible GRID of ENERGY Which brings me to my most revealing dream as of late: I followed a girl who said she was leading me to the Tree of Life and Wisdom where all the answers would be. It was in the aftermath of the Pandemic and I was with a group of complete strangers but we called each other Family. It was in some ghetto in LA and I followed her through paths in an endless field until I reached it, and she broke through the electric fence (metaphor for electric boundary/GRIDLINES) ? and I went to the Tree but there was a Shape-Shifting demon Guarding the Tree of Life, I had to show him my true face and it turned out the demon was actually the Girl and she was afraid of her own shadow. So my theory is that there is an Grid of secret electrical energy and that in order to ascend and be free of the matrix we have to see this Grid for what it is and breakthrough a square or something…lots of my dreams reference t
he Matrix more-so than even before seeing the movies. It is what I would call it, but its a frightening subject for anyone who has issues confirming and staying grounded in physical reality, the truth is that the impossible is threatening to people until they do the impossible and its not bad. Think of all the good things this world would be if we could do the impossible."

174352658,"I really don’t think having mental illness is “trendy.” I mean, I used to, but I think I’ve taken a lesson in empathy since stabilizing. We live in a world where people are expected to work work work, leaving little time for relaxation and leisure. It’s stressful. Honestly, I feel like some of you guys are disillusioned. If you’re on disability, work only a single part time job, are a stay at home spouse or parent, or volunteer a few times a week, then you don’t get it. People with chronic and severe mental illnesses are permitted by society to live lives that are low stress in order to stay out of the hospital, but what about the rest of the population? They’re human too, and they have all kinds of stressors that make things hard. People are walking around with terminal illness still having to work full time jobs because the government won’t give them enough money to support their families, and health insurance doesn’t always pay for treatment. People in this modern society tru
ly are depressed and anxious, and are just recently finding that they don’t have to be ashamed of not being able to handle societal pressures. Just because there are more of them, doesn’t mean that their struggles are less valid. People can have severe short term physical illnesses and crises (mono, heart attacks, pneumonia, broken bones, strokes, etc.) and no one sh its all over them for being open about their problems. Why are we gatekeeping mental illness like it’s some badge of honor? That’s the real question. That said, there are people who don’t have any mental illness who pretend to for attention. If they are taking resources from those who truly need them, then of course, those people are an issue, but let’s be careful not confuse being a fake with being unashamed. Just because there’s still _USER_ID_ around schizophrenia doesn’t mean that other mental illnesses should have any. _USER_ID_ refers to outside perception of an illness, and has no bearing on the validity of an illness or th
e character of its sufferers."

It’s mostly that when I watch a show, I never remember it. I can watch it numerous times without ever spoiling the ending. Faces keep changing on me too. I think that one person looks like another and I can’t always tell them apart if they are out of context. I don’t know if that’s from schizophrenia. It could be some other issues.

You can’t help your feelings, but please remember she is doing her job. Her job is to care about you. Not to be romantically interested in you.

From 2014 to 2017 I probably had latent schizophrenia, as I was getting paranoid about my body image after a gym injury. Sometimes feeling peoples eyes on me, or strangers laughing at me. Since May 2018 (when I was released from hospital), absolutely no symptoms, except for derealization twice a month, but it’s been almost 2 months since my last derealization episode. On meds from March 2018 to Jan 2019, off meds for 7 months. I don’t think I’ve seen anyone one this forum who has made a full recovery…I can’t be the only one surely? I wish I could have some statistics on making a full recovery. I saw a guy on the news, who had psychosis before, but was never ill again. Also I currently don’t have schizophrenia as I am symptomless, and I only realized last month that I actually had schizophrenia (mild/latent) from 2014-2018."

My death (the first time) was very specific, and so convincing that I was calling loved ones from the “scene of the accident” to tell them I love them one last time. Since then, I occasionally have an episode related to that first death. But I’ve “died” a few more times since then, in very different unrelated ways, always very detailed and 100% realistic in all of the 5 senses. Once I was murdered, one time was a drug overdose, another was a suicide, etc… I’m always (even on my good days) at least partially convinced that it’s either already happened or that I’m still in the process of dying.

I’m honestly better and stable now compared to a few years ago. I’m on risperidone and fluoxetine (Prozac) and the meds help alot. I’m relatively functioning but I had to drop out of university cause my cognition is really bad. I started working in my father’s poultry farm 3 years ago and it’s not too stressful.my problem is everyone is just suggesting I should get married and to be honest I really do want to but I don’t think I can support a family financially. Relationships and marriage are stressful on their own let alone when mental illness is involved. My doctor says alot of people with similar conditions are married and coping but I keep telling them I can’t get married. I see a lot of ladies that I like sometimes and I become interested but then a few symptoms flare 
up and I become ambivalent.one minute I decide I can marry some minutes later I change my mind. Another thing is the Prozac makes me less interested in intimacy from its side effects.And the thing is in my culture and religion we are encouraged to marry. Who here faces a similar problem and was able to find a solution.who here is married and coping,how do you cope financially. Worse part is in my country there’s no such thing as disability benefits.thank. I wish you all the best and a quick recovery"

176042694,"I was on it in 2003 and it didn’t work well for me. But in 2015 or so my pdoc at the time suggested I go on a low dose along with my main amisulpride med so as to help with my depression. It worked well. When I tried to go off amisulpride and just take olanzapine though, it didn’t work. It only works for me as a supplement med on a low dose. It makes me get restless legs a few hours after my dose so I take it just before bed so I don’t suffer with the akathisia. I also have larger appetite on it and I think weight gain too."
176042695,"I might think that my mental disorders may be like “gift” of Providence to protect me from poverty and grave sins by reducing culpability due to being insane and challenged mentally.

I fell in love with aspijkas (female people with _PERSON_’s syndrome or similar disorders). I have dreams about having highly intelligent wife with ASD and procreating offspring with her. Wifelessness can be mentally painful for me."

Also , i wonder how can we see our brain in neurons’ level that there are so-called neurontransimitter in our brain? is there with a such device exist that we can see the pictureof these neurotrasmitter doing their jobs?"

He said I was very stabilized now and have been stabilized for most of the past 11 years and taking me off anti-psychotics would be a disaster. He said there was virtually no chance that I wouldn’t relapse and that it would take me about 6 - 12 months to end up in the hospital again and that by the time I was stabilized again, 5 to 6 years would go by, meanwhile my life would be ruined in oh so many ways. Bottom line, I’m staying on my meds. Thanks everyone for your guidance. I’ll try to exercise more and will be doubling up on metformin to manage my diabetes - doctor’s & sz.com friend’s orders."

It was a good apartment and I wish I could do some of the things here that I did there but at least I have people to spend a holiday with if my relatives are unavailable some day, they’ll find me if I collapse in my room, I don’t binge like I did, and we go to stores, and appointments with less stress involved."

176042777,I disagree. I don’t think I am getting better I’ve had it worse this month than last. How can I have had a bad voices attack two nights ago and then jumbled thoughts and depression and be better??? So I guess I must lower my meds then… my suffering accounts for nothing.

176042803,Working full-time has it positives and negatives. Being a part of the work force and contributing to the economy are some of my positive views. Earning an income that pays more than disability benefits is also a plus not to mention the co-worker friends you will make at the job. A job keeps you busy and you won’t be bored all the time but also shower every 2nd day or every day. Some negative sides to being employed full-time is less time to sleep in and do nothing all day.
176042804,"Like people said, there are simple recipes online. I found a website that has three ingredient meals. It doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. Just cook simple meals three or four nights a week. Try different simple recipes and if you find a couple that are popular with the kids than cook it often and it should get simple to make once you do it a few times and become familiar with it. Also, find a recipe for something like stew or soup or chili or whatever and make one big batch and serve it once and then freeze the rest to pull out when you feel you just can’t cook that night. I used to cook some good dishes when I lived alone. I had various pots and pans and bowls and other cooking equipment. Now, I don’t cook as much and I basically just have four pieces of cookware that I use. I only cook meals using those four things; it makes cooking a lot easier."

174352776,"And on bipolar results Higher than expected placebo response is a common problem in bipolar depression clinical trials. This paper also mentioned that high placebo response in BPD clinical trials is seen in patients with mild disease, bipolar II, mixed-episode, first-episode, rapid cycling, atypical, non-psychotic, substance abusers and medically ill. Other factors like female sex, older age, the use of concomitant medication like benzodiazepines, a high frequency of visits, a high number of treatment groups and sites, fixed-dose designs, and the concomitant use of psychotherapy also may increase placebo response. It’s possible that a difference in these characteristics between the two studies may have contributed to the different outcomes. Another explanation for the different results of the two trials could be a difference in the treatment approaches for BPD in the U.S. and outside the U.S. The management will announce more data from these trials, including subgroups analysis in the near future 
which may help to shed more light on the reasons for high placebo response in study 401. In the conference call announcing the BPD data on July 8, the management expressed their excitement about the robust data in study 404, mentioned that drug’s pharmacology worked just as they expected and also mentioned that the study 404 results support developing Lumateperone to treat other depressive disorders like major depression. They also stated that about 50% of BPD trials fail even if the drug is efficacious. High placebo response in study 401 also could be due to more treatment arms (3 treatment arms vs two in study 404), which causes a bias, study 401 also had more severe depression at the baseline (measured by MADRS score) compared to study 404. Additional data like responder analysis from both studies and CGI endpoint data from study 401 will be released at a future medical meeting. Moreover, there’s an unmet need for newer drugs to treat bipolar type 2 disorder since most drugs currently being used to tre
at bipolar type 2 (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, seroquel, latuda, etc.) are in fact approved for bipolar type 1, and thus are used off-label and also are associated with side effects. Lumateperone was successful in study 404 in BPD type 2 subgroup as well, so it could be a new treatment option for these patients. The management plans to approach FDA with the results of both studies 404 and 401 to discuss further plans for lumateperone’s approval and will not wait for results of the phase 3 study 402 (lumateperone as an adjunct therapy to lithium or valproate in BPD, data in 2020). With industry veterans like Dr. _PERSON_ as head of regulatory affairs (over 20 years of global regulatory affairs experience, including senior regulatory affairs positions at Allergan (NYSE:AGN)) and their past success in negotiating the NDA approval for lumateperone in schizophrenia indication (in a similar mixed results situation), I’m leaning toward a favorable outcome of BPD related discussions with FDA."

(I know you Pm’d me and it did feel tailored to me - not something you cut and paste to many.) I’m not freaked out, but I understand everything changes, ha. Still I will tell you that in attempting to find another’s book on Amazon, I came across something called “The Collected Schizophrenias”, which is a book of essays, albeit from only one person. That’s what excites me… bc I too, can write in bursts… and a dream could be to get published and have some camaraderie a long the way. This is actually how I contemplated cheering up _AT_MENTION_ when she mentioned being in a downbeat mood the other day, but I balked because I thought it had no humor(and it doesn’t), but maybe it’s somehow more 
worthwhile today. So without prefacing it so much: Zombie - did anything like this ever cross your mind? I ask because I don’t know the first thing about what brings it all to market.

176042957,"I think psychosis damages the brain. I am a wreck while psychotic. I can’t function on my own, don’t remember anything, and eat rarely. With medication I am semi-coherent but tired. I’m tired now and sleep a lot during the day. I work though and sleep on my down time. I feel fine but wish I was not so exhausted. Being tired is my major complaint about medication. My memory has improved on medication. My poor judgment is better also. I was exercising frequently for awhile but became tired again. I will try to resume walking again for my health when I feel more motivated. I don’t want to be psychotic anymore so I take my medication. I have been psychotic many times and don’t want to repeat this pattern of going off my medication then becoming psychotic. My brain is functioning somewhat still. The brain damage I incurred while being psychotic has taken some time to heal. If I had not resumed my medication, I would be really disabled. I could have qualified for disability, may be. That would 
have been an interesting experience to be on disability. Hmm, oh well, I’m working so such is life."

176042984,"I’ve experienced mental, emotional, verbal and physical abuse since 2014… I guess my relationship turned into one of those toxic, domestic abuse types. Stupidly I stayed, because I felt like I had no other option at the time because I’d just lost my job and had no money, and no family in this country I could turn to. To make matters worse he gave me an ultimatum and we had to move in with his parents, leaving our independence and freedom behind, and in what could have been the worst decision ever made, at their house he was even worse because they mollycoddled him and wouldn’t make him face up to his actions, like I wanted him to in order to get him to stop. So I found myself in a very hostile environment. I got sick a few years later, thankfully when we’d since moved back into a place of our own. He called the police on me one day during a bout of psychosis and I was dragged off to the mental hospital for a few weeks. I was outraged because even after everything he’d done to me, I neve
r once called the police on him, I’d even lied to them twice when neighbours called them to the house because they suspected domestic abuse when they heard us fighting. I’m a stupid girl for staying. Things are better now, if only because I started kicking his ass back! He backed off then.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a GSH synthesis precursor, has demonstrated modest clinical benefit in schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of acute administration of NAC on GSH and Glu levels measured with 1H MRS in 19 patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy control subjects. Levels of GSH were acquired in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and those of Glu in dACC and media
l prefrontal cortex (mPFC), at baseline and 60?min following acute oral administration of 2400?mg of NAC. No differences in the levels of GSH or Glu were found at baseline or following NAC administration between patients with schizophrenia and control subjects in either of the targeted brain regions. Future studies measuring GSH levels in brain regions previously found to exhibit glutamatergic abnormalities or using genetic polymorphisms, while controlling for the age and medication status of the cohorts, are warranted to better identify groups of patients more likely to respond to NAC and its mode of action and mechanisms."

176043073,Happy new year!
176043074,"I had a friend who died to overdose.I was 18 then,and he was year older.He was former drug addict when I met him,and didn’t know anything about drugs.We used to go drinking because we were to young to find some drugs at that time (it was 1993).There wasn’t drugs on the corner,so I kept him asking about his experience with different drugs,and somehow brought his addiction back from remission.Finally,we managed to find heroin and he soon became addict again.We were 17 at that time.Two years after he died,and before that he was in coma for a month.Now I feel guilt because of feeling that I brought him back to drugs.We were parted at that time,because he already got him self in criminal activities.When I heard that he died from a guy he was doing drugs with him,he sounded like it was natural and was very cold.I knew he’s family so at the funeral when I was not eating three days before and looked very pale,he’s mother thought that I’m near death and asked my number to phone my mother to tell h
er to take some messures about me.I had a girlfriend who saved me from grieving.Sorry for long post."

176043078,"Yeah, it has a bunch of “perks” i.e. good hours, good pay etc."
176043079,I hope so. With COVID they can’t invite me face to face so I hope what they get is enough
176043080,"Yesterday almost got psychosis after overdosing on a dopamine supplement. Could have ended up in the hospital but luckily took my meds asap and took an extra 2mg Risperdal so 6mg Risperdal total, back to normal and slept well. Feeling good and normal today."
176043081,"I was working yesterday for my sister, i made a stair case for a tree house, i can do carpentry and construction, i enjoyed it so much a sense of achivement when it was finished brought great satisfaction to me…and yes i am getting back to work i am fully capable toward this…i am waiting on a phone call from my brother he has work on the line for me"
176043082,I do not know if this is depression or not. I just am tired and want to retire for the night. It is very early and I just do not have the motivation to do anything.
176043083,I’ll probably take my bike out and get a little exercise later. I canceled my gym membership due to Covid.
176043084,Wise words indeed.
176043085,"_PERSON_… I’ve been working out now for two weeks, weight training and walking 45 minutes a day, plus a 1300 calorie budget a day. Yet today when I weighed myself the scale went up 2 pounds! Whatever, I’m just gonna keep doing what I’m doing and I’m assuming eventually I’ll see results on the scale. I already see results in how my clothes fit…"
176043086,I should have said something a few weeks back when I developed a sore throat
176043087,Make a few notes beforehand. Most of the time I take notes to my pdoc appointments.
176043088,Seems in Chinese astrology it’s less individualized. I know I’m the year of the horse. That doesn’t say much about me other than my birth year though. I prefer western astrology. I think it’s all food for thought tho.
176043089,"Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _AT_MENTION_"
176043090,oh i hope they contact you quickly about meds.

176043094,"I’m deeply sympathetic to this approach, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ in particular, which led me to choose discursive psychology as one the methods for my master’s thesis. To my shame, however, I’ve never read _PERSON_, but I am trying to challenge my prejudices about the guy. If it’s not too much to ask, what was your psychosis like? Did you have systematised delusions? Also, is it delusional to believe the universe is a demonic simulation and our humanity an illusion?"
176043095,Thank you Wave and everhopeful for the likes.
176043096,"If he does come and they start ???? with him, I may go off on them lol. Hopefully the more somber atmosphere will put things into perspective for them and they might actually appreciate his presence, but…"
176043097,I think what they really mean is they can’t read you because they can’t read subtlety. So you have to manually show expression so you won’t be such a mystery to them.
174352817,My positive symptoms are about an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale.
176043098,"_AT_MENTION_ , i have no idea about the time there, but i hope you feel better. How are you now?"
174352829,It’s pretty subtle stuff. You only notice it’s been doing stuff once you stop taking it.
176043099,I certainly understand that. I had a low self esteem for many many years. I think it’s why I let men do to me what they did.
176043100,"well I tried to meet up with a guy I met on Saturday but freaked out and had to sneak off and leave. I went to a festival - first time I have been confident in ages. and met him and he was nice n stuff, but I didn’t trust his eyes. why am I freaking out - I had that much of a bad vibe I had to ring crisis team."
176043101,lol _AT_MENTION_ i am mad but you are madder than me
176043102,What do you mean
176043103,Zombie thread. Twice!
176043104,Try vaping? It worked for me. No guarantee though.
176043105,"I can understand it treating psychosis but not sz. If you have some sort of toxic infection in your blood, maybe it would help. It wouldn’t affect a lifelong condition like sz though."
176043106,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . We will see her soon!
176043107,"Same i got prazosin for nightmares, it did nothing and lowered my blood pressure so much I’d almost faint when waking up in the morning. In the hospital we use clonidine as an emergency blood pressure med to lower someone’s BP if it’s at or above 160/90. So if you take it you should really take your BP beforehand with one of those electronic cuffs to make sure you don’t accidentally drop yourself too low."
176043108,Walk the dog. Laundry. Tidy up a bit.
176043109,Can you change your phone number ?
176043110,"Aye that sounds pretty rough, changed days like my time is the forensic unit was tough but no as bad as that… fortunate enough to be a fairly new antipsychotic as well"
176043111,"Someone asked in Reddit yesterday if ‘life was worth living.’ Not in a suicidal manner… But this a forum of normies and probably the top 5 replies were complaints about being overworked. _AT_MENTION_ keeps talking about ‘the great reset.’ I don’t really know what it is tho. Something about everyone in the world taking a big chill pill and not stressing so much. Idk, I could be wrong…"
176043112,Do you have any thoughts on _NAME_?
176043113,Not taking/reducing meds or smoking weed. I had psychosis after being stable on meds because of weed.
176043114,PTSD and Manic Bipolar come to mind.
174352821,"I was unhealthy too, bad diet, smoked, no exercise, negative thinking. I came to the same conclusion and I did the exact thing same thing as you. Quit smoking, started eating healthy, started walking, changed my thinking to be more positive with CBT. I’m in a much better place today than I have ever been. Took time to develop new habits but it’s just normal behavior now, it was worth it."
176043115,_AT_MENTION_ …I know how u feel…but trust me these delusions can be cracked…you just neeed to get the right meds…and also CBT can help I hope you crack these delusions soon

176043120,"I was lost for some years before my diagnosis. I got lost many times far from home while driving, in buses, metro. I didn’t know what illness I had. I had read about sz but was scared to believe that I had it. I refused that I had sz. I told myself that I had depression to feel better. I kept refusing my sz diagnosis for some years after my sz diagnosis."

176043124,"I dress super casual. Old baggy jeans, worn out shoes, t shirt, and baggy hoodie and baseball style cap. My brother says that I dress like a homeless person. I guess I stick out but there is quite a large older and retired population that dresses up similarly. So I don’t stick out so much."
176043125,I weighed 78.8 kg this morning. Woppdidoo
176043126,Haha thanks. I’ll look up how to do a bridge. Yeah I thought this was one of my best. Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176043127,Many of the world’s oldest people smoked cigarettes. It’s all bull that tobacco is dangerous. It’s down to genetics and health.
174352823,"What if you think that your family is plotting against you, and you kill them first? This is what happened to a fellow schizophrenic some years ago in Greece. Delusions may be fun, sometimes, but may be dangerous. We have to take our meds. This is our responsibility and duty"
176043128,I’m glad it’s less intense now. Hopefully it’s just withdrawal symptoms and will go away soon
176043129,Do you have benzos you can take to calm yourself? I had all my teeth pulled and I asked my dr for just enough to get me through the appointment. It worked well.
176043130,"My father came to my place and told me i live in mess and dirt. _USER_ID_, i told him. He is toxic and negative always"
176043131,Anyone relate to this or have any idea what it is?
176043132,"Yes, I definitely agree I am on the lower end of the the spectrum. Based on my childhood I was abused by my mother, but treated with kindness and love by my father. I believe if I had only been raised by my mother alone. I would have killed her, and my brother and gone on to hurt others. But because my father showed me that he loved me, I remained taimed. I do agree with the diagnosis because as a child I did hurt others badly and abused animals. I had not sense of danger or worry over things. I think now, I have found that my anger, hate and rage is mostly directed at criminals. I believe when it comes to someone hurting others I am amoral, which means I will kill no matter right or wrong as long as it stays directed at those that hurt others. Sounds strange but this is how I’ve slowly molded my thinking."
176043133,"Hey, thanks for asking. It went alright, didn’t get too many answers. My therapist and I set some goals that I’m going to work on meeting throughout the week. My other therapist says that it is not abnormal to hear footsteps and other things, especially if one has a fear of home intruders."
176043134,Oh no I definently didn’t hallucinate him there. I’m thinking along the lines that maybe I seen him before subconsciously. All my coincidences aren’t hallucinations.
176043135,oh ok thank you both _AT_MENTION_
176043136,Either your pharmacy or treatment team can tell you. Best not to take replacements in case some was absorbed unless you received guidance otherwise.
176043137,I don’t think so but I’m not 100% sure. I thought there were only the 3.
176043138,"It’s like a positive feedback cycle. People r going out panic buying, which panics others so they go out, then more, and more, and more. I hope my country’s stock will not get exhausted fully etc etc cos wat are we all gonna do??"
176043139,I drink 5 cups of double espresso every day
174352830,"I’m not going to encourage your delusions. You probably just have schizophrenia too. I just feel mine was triggered by real events and that my life was purposely destroyed, modified, and altered. Sort of like chronic gaslighting, TI, and gang-stalking to say the least. I wish it was just simple schizophrenia. I’m highly intelligent despite my inability to live and function. Sort of like a super intelligent robot or replicant or android. They say if you view everything as real or everything you have or see as a conspiracy theory, you probably have schizophrenia. That’s me. It fits me perfectly since I think most if not all conspiracy theories are true in some sense or true. I just think I have artifically induced schizophrenia. I believe schizophrenia is caused by an alien made virus."
176043140,They dont work for me and I am trying to quit all drugs the only drugs iam on are cigs sz medication and ATAVAN but I want to smoke weed agian when my sz goes away one day with a good diet and exercise
174352827,_AT_MENTION_ On the card above it lists “mania” as a symptom of sz. Is mania a common symptom of sz or is it probably schizoaffective ? Or do they differentiate between the two anymore? Thanks (in advance)
174352833,No really? Hadn’t guessed.
176043141,"A word my mother used about herself which seemed like all of the time. It’s a closed minded thing that rejects others but looks passable because you are “busy” doing something and just speak to avoid or pass the time. If I were nice, I’d put the busywork down for a moment and give a little attention. I know people can close their minds to problems but it’s very frustrating when you need help and get a shut out for an answer."
176043142,Love is a shi…t at this moment but I like your song
176043143,What is class A?
176043144,"Usually mood swings are treated with ADs. In case of SZ-A mood swings, Latuda would be the best option for that."
176043145,Of course its immoral. No one has a right to your privacy which I wish people would understand. I’m tired.

176043148,"i really want a good memory to help me study. sometimes i will read a chapter in a book and then forget it. i wonder if i can handle school as i really have to try quite hard to learn something. like read it 10 times and take notes and not stop reviewing for some time until it’s cemented in my memory. it’s really time consuming. i could really use an aid, are there any meds for memory?"
176043149,"I will start my second year now in September, no problem. It´s hard, you need to make 3x the effort but if you are passionate it doesn´t matter. My advice would be to study everyday, at least 30 min if you can´t more. Force yourself to do that. Humm 65k seems like a lot, can´t you study in the Netherlands/nordic countries? I bet the price is much cheaper. I payed 1.000€ for the first year and 2k for this one."
174352848,"If you really want to try it, get some nicotine patches or gum. Dont smoke. You really dont want that habit. I read a report online compiled from some studies, and something in tobacco smoke lowered antipsychotic blood levels. It wasn’t the nicotine."
176043150,"oh, sorry to hear that"
176043151,"Actually, yes that’s exactly it. I don’t feel at the level of people, I think they will “mistreat” me psychologically. In fact I do not really admit yet that this trauma has a lot of importance in my daily behavior. I am also afraid of conflict with people, as if they could be a physical and psychological threat to me."
176043152,You deserve to be happy so don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. I’m soon to be 50 and I reserve the right to live my life on my terms. You can let yourself be happy _AT_MENTION_

176043154,"Mine used to speak here and there, kind of whenever I wanted them to, then it was more frequently, and then eventually it was throughout the whole night and if I fell asleep during the night they said they would kill me whilst I am sleeping with drugs that they would _NAME_ into my body"

My legs and hands. Felt like a freak. Guess I need to get out of the house more lol… Have you ever done this? I got lucky. No one noticed/didnt point it out. Which was kind of them.

176043161,Yeah I don’t know enough about religion and God to say I believe in God but I’ve always felt and still do that there is a higher power. So yeah something like that.
176043162,"What does she consider a small dose? One of those 37mg pills is half of what you usually take. That seems to be more than “a little”. I don’t want to steer you wrong, these are just my thoughts."
176043163,Okey Dokey…
176043164,"So my voices advised that the people in my head should be seen as delusions, because you should trust the word by the other people. So who on the joke is the biggest then?"
176043165,The one that’s third from the left.
176043166,"No, when I want to waste or kill time, I just stay on the computer. But in the hospitals, it was my favorite past times."
176043167,our illness is misunderstood the most
176043168,Mine happened when I was addicted to crack. It kind of interfered with my smoking but I guess that is a good thing.
176043169,"imperius do you exercise or just diet. and how long did take you to lose that weight, was it hard."
176043170,"I know it has been suggested to you before, but you should a ‘thinly fictionalised’ account of your story."
176043171,"_PERSON_ had very similar problems, became an atheist, and was completely civil about our difference of beliefs. If people join support groups to discuss common problems, and these topics are illegal, then why join the forums at all? Why not implement tags like ‘religion’ or ‘extra terrestrials’ so users can filter subjects they find agitating, without barring support to others harboring alien or devil-related paranoias? I don’t plan on mentioning the mere existence of religion again on the site, don’t worry; I’ll just post harmless threads like this and leave my schizophrenia-related issues burning a hole in my brain where they belong. I’m sure I’ve wasted time by reaching out to a support site in the first place, this just seems to be the norm."
176043172,"still ringing. U.K. phone suidide helpline. Mental health will ring a ambulance, I don’t need this"
176043173,I’d like to drop mine on her head.
174352850,I’ve been declining cognitively but I’m not experiencing any significant positive symptoms. My negatives are pretty intense.
176043174,"I dont know. I never had long psychoses. Maybe a few days, one or two weeks."
176043175,It always gets worse right before my period. Is it that way with you?
176043176,Then your happiness came down when you began to fear hell.
176043177,"I think since your dr isn’t helping you, you should go to the ER and tell them everything that is happening to you and everything you’re afraid of"
176043178,lol really why did you that.
176043179,My Kodak printer was really good. And the printer ink is reasonably priced.

176043183,"Mine lasted for years and I was very aware of it, but it didn’t make the pain lessen much at all. Maybe it has lessened now, but I still have to manage it."
176043184,If it’s going to be a committed relationship then disclosure is essential. I disclosed to the gal who is now my wife a few weeks into dating. She’s still putting up with me over two decades later.
176043185,"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/new-hope-depression-horizon Unlike other available antidepressants, it is believed the SNDRI class of medications will be relatively beneficial in preserving patients’ sexual functions. Data also suggests SNDRIs will have a better safety profile, produce a more rapid onset, and provide better efficacy.1"
174352849,Hmmm… That’s a possibility isn’t it. Good idea. If it is I’m in trouble as I’m not sure I can cut down further (i need it to tolerate abilify). But it certainly could be. I’ll see what I can do to prove or disprove it. Thanks wave !
174352851,Abilify and Rexulti but I can’t take them due to addiction and hypersexuality side effects. I must be unlucky. Got sz and then can’t take the meds that help me due to side effects and now Vraylar isn’t available in Canada. I don’t know when this bad luck will end
176043186,I’ve noticed after taking psych ward medication music now feels flat. Has this happened to anyone else? Antipsychotics are known for slowing down dopamine levels. That probably has something to do with it. I’ve been pretty upset since I noticed this change in how I hear things.
176043187,So sorry for picking holes I actually think it’s pretty amazing
176043188,That are probably spam calls but seems like it’s not. Like one time I sent my friend from college a message on Facebook or something. Then I got a call from New York where he lives about 2 mins later. I didn’t answer because I was too paranoid. But stuff like this happens a lot. Or maybe it’s all real. But probably just a robo call.
176043189,Easy peeps. Keep civil and supportive. I thought many strange things that were tied up with our version of the CIA. I always find it interesting how delusions can be similar between people who are from different cultures.
176043190,I hope u both feel better soon… _PERSON_ by lil we keep on keepin on

176043195,I wasn’t stupid in college and neither was anyone I studied with. I’m not sure what exactly you’re asking though

176043197,Very relaxing. I like it
176043198,"I normally dont like these posts but I know you’re a level-headed guy _AT_MENTION_ so I’ll give you some advice. If you EVER get an urge, a voice, to hurt your loved ones, go and talk to that specific person right away. Just have a conversation, could be about anything. BUT, If you ever get the urge, a voice, to hurt someone random, that you dont even know, then I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest you check into a hospital or see a specialist ASAP. Hope this helps."
174352853,Don’t let anyone bully you!
176043199,"I just started having some coffee the last few days and just today I started to believe that peoples actions around me (people I don’t know) had something to do with me. Like I would walk out of the store and there was some guy walking towards me and rambling (most likely on bluetooth with someone), and my first impression was that it had something to do with me. I shook it off after a couple of seconds, but still this kind of thoughts are troubling. I just had one cup of coffee, so I guess I am really sensitive. I might go back to decaf, or try like half a teaspoon of instant. I read a couple of articles that people with psychiatric disorders should not take much coffeine anyways. Anybody else had trouble with symptoms coinciding with coffeine?"
176043200,I don’t have any positive symptoms and its very rare for me to have positive symptoms. However negative symptoms are a different story. They’re fairly frequent although to differing degrees.

176043209,My goal is to make it through today with no panic attacks. I’ve been having some the past few days. Usually it’s weeks between them. But I’ve had one two nights in a row. Mine from last night continued this morning from just hearing my moms voice. Something is going on where I’ve been feeling uncomfortable around my parents
176043210,_AT_MENTION_ have you ever tried paliperidone?its really effective against positive symptoms
176043211,That’s great! _PHONE_NO_
176043212,Ah sadly where I live people are that vicious. It is very tense here. Peace to you.
176043213,Thanks… Sezbot.
176043214,I am going to be in the desert. It’s cheap but no paradise. If I don’t bring my dogs I can rent a place for $650. If I bring the dogs $950 per month.
176043215,No no honey no bodily love never meant that.
176043216,what ? pdoc 's meds not sleep meds
176043217,"In addition to being _PERSON_, I think I am a hypochondriac. Do you ever get a little disappointed when your test results come back negative? When I hear that it is nothing, it takes the wind out of my sails a bit, and I have to adjust my panicked mind."
176043218,This song helps me. I think it’s so pretty and melodic. <3
176043219,"_AT_MENTION_ the thread is hidden because it is potentially very triggering. I’ll leave it open, however. None of us are part of any conspiracy."
176043220,I would not have guessed it but now that you say it you do look very Norwegian
176043221,Her families reaction to her in the bedroom was sad :’(. Such a contrast in emotion to earlier on n she’s not there to witness how much they actually care.
174352856,As the coronavirus spreads we need to be reminded of the theory that a virus while the future schizophrenic is still in her Mother’s womb can make her a future statistic if the family genealogy is wrong. I am begging the scientific community to consider this possibility and protect the pregnant women out there vulnerable to this crap and their unborn the best you can. (and I am against a eugenics approach because my life was worth living.) Perhaps something can be done for them that could not have been done for us. Thank you.
176043222,"A distant relative of mine on my estranged dads side - climbed on the roof of his house - and blew himself away with a shotgun years ago. I remember it upset dad terribly, and mum said he deserved it. It didnt pry cos i was young at the time, but dads side of the family is full of dodgyness anyway."
176043223,What did you do and is your current BMI in acceptable range?
175097299,No my father didn’t feel nauseous You should call your doctor although I think it’s a side effect.
176043224,No you don’t. This desire to quit meds is exactly why you need a shot instead of pills
176043225,I worry about what it’s going to be like for me when I’m 80 etc
176043226,Needn’t be. As long as he does not claim to be his messenger.
176043227,Yeah good luck. Hope it’s all good and your back to normal. It’s nice to get some good news from the doctors.
176043228,How do you know it’s real for priests?
176043229,I struggle with the _NAME_ show too and have tried to figure out solutions.
176043230,"Yes, thanks _AT_MENTION_ ."
176043231,Is it scary or triggering?
174352855,"Okay, let me explain certain things about the delusion. I’ve yelled a few times over the past 10 years in San _NAME_ county. Including the Sycuan reservation during the last presidency. A few months later the Kumeyaay were finally awarded a good amount of land they were owed. It is likely a coincidence and something the former president was planning to do in his last years of office. I’ve yelled in mostly less populated areas here so as not to attract attention. Twice in _USER_ID_ Cliffs. One was _PERSON_!! My reason for yelling that at the time was because I was deeply hurt upon reading about the abortions and mistreatment of Chinese women. I didn’t think about the word, it came naturally. That year certain provinces flooded. Mostly I’ve yelled ????. Which seems to make the clouds open up within half an hour. I figure San _NAME_ has a strong military presence, some sonar radar may have picked my yells up and more importantly they’d be better prepared for defense or keeping it under cover
. Before I yelled in Monterey county. They have Fort Hunter Ligget as well as the Monterey Naval institute of defense languages or some such name. It was classified before then became common knowledge, was closed and reopened again. When I was young, I’m talking a child and again sometime later as an adult. I had a dream they had a pool of water with some sort of black rod and several camera like objects on that rod, it would skim over the top of the pool. Inside the pool, there would sometimes be someone yelling underwater to see what effect a particular word might cause and how the bubbles might move. I haven’t shared that much with people. Anyway, so far I’ve yelled (on purpose) in my life _PERSON_, ????, yahweh manan Ital eim Cuauhtemoc, and xuha. At different times. ???? being the one I yelled the most. I always felt they all had slightly different effects. Well that is some more info on the delusion. As for the land awarded I figured it might also have been awarded so that in world intelligence ag
encies that may have picked it up, U.S. wouldn’t have to deal with it as much because it would technically not have been in their land. The top three loudest were, Gohan in Monterey county, Xuha in _USER_ID_ Cliffs, and ???? near the reservation. That one and _PERSON_ were about on par in volume. The cuauhtemoc one was indoors. During my first 5150 after I woke up from my very first sedating injection. I was drugged and didn’t know what the ???? was going on, nor why I yelled. There was a March going on at the time by field workers. Uh… I was immediately held down and injected in the buttcheek and I fell asleep again almost immediately heh. I don’t know how loud that one was. And that’s probably why I was diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoia in the first place lol. In my defense, I’d already been injected before I yelled. _USER_ID_: oh and _PERSON_ too heh not because of DBZ but more because of the Hawaiian legend of King _PERSON_ who shouted to and a volcano erupted, he united the islands of mod
ern day Hawaii according to legend. Also other historic/ even biblical and mythical figures have yelled. Including Jesus."
176043232,I want to get this fixed ASAP so doing the supplements with switching the drug would it hurt me?
176043233,"why not? why are we not so special as to have been given this land? we destroy the land and we will ultimately be the master of our own demise (something will be anyway) Scientists will have you believe the numbers and do the math but ultimately there is no point bc it is theoretically impossible for anything to travel far enough to find out, We can look with the big powerful telescopes and study the elements of the universe, look for various gases and orbits which may suggest life but we could never go there, it is useless and futile to even look at it, a waste of time. but it makes for great science fiction."
176043234,meds can take as long as 6 weeks or more to start working
176043235,"i think it is because I washed my hands because of it (though only once, not many times)"
176043236,You think sz’s can’t feel happiness?
176043237,I’m not a girl…
176043238,"I do end up eating, I’ve gained a lot of weight on this med but I feel better mentally so I’m okay with it. _AT_MENTION_"
176043239,I see my pdoc next week thankfully.
176043240,i’m too young for that
174352871,"Hi friends, it’s been a while since I posted here I’m trying to switch from Saphris 10 mg to 20 mg Abilify, a pharm website told me days 1-3 take 5 mg of Saphris, and in morning 10 mg of Abilify then after day 3 take 15 then to 20 mg I also have lyme disease that I’m treating with Protandim Nrf2 Anyone of you have experience switching back to Abilify, the med I am the most stable on? I Will let my doctor know but he’s on vacation and if anything goes wrong I can call the hospital… I’ve been on Abilify for 8 years so I know it works but is getting of in 3 days too soon, My main symptoms are mania from a lamictal induced psychosis, Abilify 20 mg works well and keeps me stable… I am not happy with this change I’ve been taking Saphris 10 mg for about 8 months now Please any suggestions? before I log off in a few hours would be appreciated friends!"
176043241,It’s a special drug for me as it works so well. I just hope it doesn’t let me down like others have
176043242,"My family seems to think my house is their personal storage bin. My niece, daughter and dad have stuff here. I cleaned my dad’s clothes out of my house and put them in a building he has next door but he’s afraid the weather will get to them there so he wants me to put them back in my house. He just brings crap to my house without asking and his house is full of crap."
176043243,Porridge Egg pepper with one slice of toast Dinner Mallow treat and four sweets
176043244,Is it likely to induce mania? From what I’ve researched the risks are lower than most antidepressants. My doctor brought this drug to my attention.
176043245,The Horrors -
176043246,I’ve haven’t been tempted ever since I switched to Abilify. I really feel bad without it.
174352870,"Didn’t try abilify for long only like two weeks, It was causing major panic attacks and had to stop."
176043247,That’s what my psychoanalyst would say
176043248,"Every time we meet, we go deeper in my self and subconscious"
176043249,Done! _PHONE_NO_
176043250,I’ve gotten this when I have bad days
176043251,I would…that’s not fair !! it would be good for everyone…tell them to just give it a year and then decide.
176043252,Your physique now ain’t bad. Imagine being 100 lbs overweight. If you develop bad eating habits as a result of eating more protein you will balloon up in weight.
176043253,What’s the brand? I’m curious if it’s the same!
176043254,"You will get a court appointed lawyer. I would like, cancel the existing appointment, And then Get a psychiatric advanced directive the exact legal way. It should say, no invega or anything unless it is a pill form. I have been through this a few times. You will survive this injection if it happens. Best I got. Peace to you _PERSON_ (I am cis too)."
176043255,"I just stopped to try without depakote in case I don’t need it with invega 234mg. My doctor wasen’t really sure if I really need it, but I’m ready to start it again if my mood goes downhill."
174352875,That’s more normal than one thinks. I get sleep paralysis and you can hallucinate upon waking without it being schizophrenia? But I’m no doctor…I see a neurologist for other issues and they said it’s pretty common.
176043256,"We you, Leaf!"
176043257,"I changed from Invega to Aristada. Was med free for 6 months to get Invega out of my system. It’s taken 3 months worth of shots to feel the best benefits of Aristada. I felt the effects right away, but the negatives needdd time to be treated. Feeling better each day. No med is perfect,but hopefully you can find something that brings you to a better place."
176043258,There should be TRIGGER WARNING on this
176043259,That’s pretty harsh considering I was joking.
176043260,"Dude, your not everyone. You are suffering from a solipsism delusion. Take your meds."
176043261,_PERSON_ I’m trying to see if I get enough fulfillment with just friendship without the romance and sex part. I’m feeling it out. It’s just society says you have to be with someone to be complete and happy. I’m not sure at this point if that’s best for me. Although I want a partner or maybe just a roommate with no sex.
176043262,I’m my town’s resident queer parent. I can’t make a decision to save my life. I never accept my own limitations. I love quickly and fiercely.
176043263,"Buy one of those universal remotes and turn off their TVs. Hack their wifi and change the password. Used to do it all the time, now im considering starting it up again because my neighbours are driving me nuts."
176043264,"He has power of attorney. He’s just softly asking me if we should go. I don’t want to go, and he says I don’t seem well and should go. I just think that this might pass. I haven’t lost my faculties. I feel in control of myself. That’s why he’s just treading softly. It’s a tip toe approach."
176043265,"I guess the closest is my partner. Although, i feel so ashamed at having this illness, that i really don’t want to tell anyone about what is going on. I hate sympathy."
176043266,Maybe you could have an occupational and or physical therapist come out to see what can be done. I wish you the best. Take care.
176043267,I choose meds to stay stable.
176043268,"Count me in on it. I’ll be one of your earliest investors/supporters. Problem is time travel is dangerous and tricky and all ready done. I should know >_< It probably comes off as encouraging delusions, but I had dreams where I was in an elevator or platform rising in this pinkish foam or what I felt like was quantum foam…probably some nano particle crap now that I think of it. Then I went off the platform and into other places. Strange dreams I’ve been having. I felt like I’ve done a lot of things. Problem is there is no evidence or proof. Regarding your matrix comment, I know I’ve escaped. I even felt like I ran part of it-temporarily. It was a hard, learning experience. Felt like Westorld TBH."
176043269,"I only have delusions and even while I had delusions I had insight and was able to answer the doctor at times Still, I relapses two times already off medicine. Mine is a late onset as well at around age 25"
176043270,i would just study and enjoy the freedom lol
176043271,"So much weird ???? keeps happening I keep bumping into people randomly who I have not seen for years They keep me talking for ages My isolation started when our connections ended more than 7 years ago. In the space of a week, I have bumped into 5 people from my past I do not want to do drugs or hang out with them at all Getting super paranoid and stressed about this They have my phone number, and now know where my apartment is"
176043272,Black or with sugar and creamer?
176043273,I like your posts cos they are kind and full of insight. Should I call my psychiatrist?
174352874,"I have delusions that don’t go away. They feel real sometimes. I don’t hear voices. My brain is very powerful and convincing. I don’t see things, just patterns and I store a lot of information and do nothing all day. Nothing seems to work. At least Vraylar makes me feel good and sane. I struggle with severe negative symptoms. Delusions are persistant and treatment resistant. I guess caffeine can worsen delusions I think?"
176043274,Care for PM?..
176043275,"That’s a lot of sleep, but everybody’s different and some people need more than others. If it’s really bothering you, my only suggestion is to stay awake more."

174352878,"Hello there, So for the last few years ive literally been trying every med I could lay my hands on and while they semi worked, I never managed to get enough relief out of them. Ive been up and down on this forum over the few years, but I really think im stable now. It wasnt till the beginning of this year that I tried Clozapine. After like 8 months I really started feeling the benefits of being on it. The chopping and changing really helped as I found one med that really works for me. Im starting to feel good and im sure as time goes on I will feel even better. Business is good, and my project at the expo got alot of attention There is hope for you all. Get a good treatment plan and push it hard. Never give up"
176043281,I’m really sorry to hear that
176043282,Bump _PHONE_NO_
176043283,I wake up a lot in the night.

176043286,"I’m sorry you’re feeling so alone. They say it takes two weeks, but that’s usually for full benefits. Hopefully you’ll start feeling some sort of benefit sooner than that."
176043287,"Should i accept now, that for some time, it will be quite tough still? I fight just since an year, you know… Yes, oceanspray, thanks for the comment. I still live too much in my head i guess… With all my sick beliefs… Maybe i was in better shape 20 years ago lol… But i forget when was this more precisely lol… I wonder if so much isolation attributed for my worst state? Was somebody here hiding from the others as me in the past? With a bunch of physical symptoms when seeing the others? What an illness…"
176043288,Paranoia is the most distressing for me. It seems to rule my life
176043289,can’t have delusion on meds
176043290,I was 13 when i was convinced that my parents were plotting to kill me. Too paranoid to sleep that night i hid under my bed with an axe that i pinched from dad’s shed. I was ready for them.
176043291,Cool! Thanks _AT_MENTION_ .
176043292,Seems he fell to parkinsons. Sad end.
176043293,Ham and cheese croissant
176043294,"_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_, thank you for your sympathy. My whole psychotic break had to do with my efforts to forget it all. I am safe now but still scared."
176043295,I lived that in psychosis. I’d read an article or see one on the news and I’d think it was referring to me. I was admitting to crimes I had never done and it was all so scary. It would be horrible in that state if you acted out and did something serious. I’d find it hard to get over that!
176043296,The ones I’m on now. Risperidone Depakote I also found Haldol to be very effective.
176043297,I know right? I told him not to bother me again unless it specifically has to do with meds - which I need them for. He frustrates me so much
176043298,I’m sorry for your brother’s illness and his difficult living situation. Congrats to you though for your recovery ODAAT
176043299,I caught the train for a couple of years. No radio. No traffic but stuck on a narrow gauge railway ( less room) with sketchier people than me. Car 45 minutes good. An hour bad. Train 1 hour and a half minimum during peak hour where I’m standing more than not…I’d rather pay that car tax.
174352887,"It reminds me of the TV show on Netflix called Altered Carbon. I was the world’s first trillionaire and the richest man on several planets. Not really but I am that guy though or feel like that guy a lot except I’ve feared death for the longest time. I think it started when the aliens got involved and tortured me back to back a million times over. Look up altered carbon. I think I’m that guy who can come back alive through a stack except I’m now trapped in the same body with schizophrenia for eternity. I woke up in 2011 or 2013 or whatever. I never used to fear death. My family was killed in a past life in a parallel universe. I believe I’m a testimony of many worlds theory because I can tell I’m in a parallel universe and came back alive and retained my consciousness and memory. I hope I didn’t die in college…I doubt that. I often feel some girls in college ruined my life. I never figured it out. Even in an eternity. I keep guessing in my head but don’t know who. In my original l
ife I went insane at berkeley and ended up at _NAME_ looking for the insanity cure, which they found. I was the most insane person on the planet I think or at least felt because I believed i was in the matrix. One of the first believers on earth. I’m in a time loop. I guess I used to be a super soldier created by the DoD or aliens in a past life. Personally, I think it was aliens who pretended and lied. Not sure. Not sure if people believe it anymore. I just want my schizophrenia cured or to go back in time before my birth. I miss my childhood a lot. I can change the past. I had my consciousness stolen. I often feel like my life was taken like in Ghost in a Shell, the movie. I lived trillions of past lives, some different or the same. I was alive when _NAME_ won in 2016, except in this reality she lost. Only I can recall this. _PERSON_ is a million times better. Sometimes I think I’m in a computer simulation. I get called crazy and don’t claim anything or to be apart of anything. My abilities include ve
ry minor, if anything at all psychic abilities, immortality, time travel, simulation skills, and sometimes genius level intellect. Past life recall too. The downside is I’m severely insane and disabled. I cannot commit and accept I’m a fake. That my family isn’t real and its all ai and computer code 1’s and 0s on a mainframe or server. Im worried about stolen Valor and being a fraud. I was never in the military or worked for the government or ET except in distant, parallel past lives. My curse is permanent insanity in a server. I often feel I’m just an IP address… I had my brain digitized and uploaded to a computer and they put a chip in. I was also in the Illuminati in a past life and they told me I was in mk ultra. I don’t have a stack or a chip. Just quantum consciousness. Altered consciousness that is. I had this ability since the dawn of time. Possibly base reality. If I’m a fake how come they took me to _NAME_ in my past lives? I have memories of being _NAME_ and _NAME_. I can go through 
wormholes and transfer my consciousness into a new body in a parallel universe. Unfortunately, I’m stuck in the same damn schizophrenic body over and over again. A celebrity i dated in a past life said I was a vampire or immortal time traveler in a past life. I will not tell you her name but she was hot. I was tortured so bad by tall greys that I became an evangelical. Maybe this all happened in a parallel universe. I woke up in 2013. I regained my consciousness and sentience."
176043300,So that SzA is with the moods like depression. I guess am just ‘‘Sz’’.
176043301,But people on earth aren’t happy. They’re all pretty sad at the state of humanity. Wouldn’t you be?
176043302,I only care about myself. Not to be selfish but because I barely have enough for just me. I can’t worry about other people.

176043306,"yes _PHONE_NO_,"
176043307,Yes. I think watching the videos is enough to trigger an episode.
176043308,Dopamine dysregulation disorder?
176043309,"I’m on boo ckoo meds and I’m almost normal. The only things that set me apart from normal are the facts that I’m so isolated, withdrawn and unmotivated."
176043310,"I’d ask yourself why you would want to go to college and go from there. If what inspires you is inspiring people, maybe look in to starting at a place where you get to work and interact with people. There’s social pressure to go to college, but if you have no idea why you are there, there’s not a point or good outcome."
176043311,It mesmerizes us It casts spells on us It inserts suicidal and homicidal thoughts
176043312,"I have none of this, we checked it all before… My fear is so consuming, that its mental here… Some of you dont understand why i am not changing, but lately, i find very hard my mother with me… She doesnt understand my conversion disorder, who is based on my paranoia and who is stopping me even to walk often… The weakness also comes from this conversion disorder… I’d wish my zyprexa will lift me one day, it will open this numbed brain, but i dont understand why its not working… None of the other aps didnt work on my fears, i tried 11 aps, no way to try them again…"
176043313,Someone else? 1662
176043314,I echo what _AT_MENTION_ said. But I think I am too sensitive now. Like it is affecting my functionality.
176043315,I shouldn´t pick usernames/pictures related to my life. Idk maybe i´ll change them.
176043316,"I think on this rare occasion, Your boyfriend is right. Don’t worry about it."
176043317,I feel that sz made me stupid. My psychiatrist told me that sz reduces working memory and concentration but it also reduces social and emotional intelligence!
176043318,"Try to knock that on the head. You don’t want to become an alcoholic like me , trust me. Don’t throw away your future. Sorry you’re having such a rough time."
176043319,"I’m torn between what I think is the more sensible—cremation—and being laid out in makeup, church clothes and formaldehyde and then buried in a wooden casket. The second one appeals to my fascination with grotesqueness and the macabre, but it’s also more expensive. I definitely want a creepy old headstone though."
176043320,"I am on Amisulpride 800mg a day. I am at risk of high prolactin. My GP didn’t bother to check in my annual check up, but the CMHT are doing a physical for me next Monday, so I will find out then I will be very disappointed if I have to change meds again."
176043321,Just let your Drs know and try to ignore your paranoia the most you can.
176043322,Im quite open about it these days i tell everyone and then they can either love it or leave it livin la _NAME_ loca
176043323,It’s not an exact science. Please be civil and supportive. Even sarcasm has it’s issues so that is understood.
176043324,I’m proud to say I’m in love and happy. Thank you universe. So happy. _PERSON_ and thought id never get over my ex. Ex I’m over you… A billion Times mantra.
176043325,Along with _PERSON_ and _NAME_
176043326,I read the original study and didn’t feel the evidence the study presented supported the conclusions it made. I hadn’t considered the evidence might have been fabricated in the first place.
176043327,"I have a saying that I made up : “Black can become white, overnight”. It reminds me that things can change quite quickly."
176043328,"I used to suck at managing money until I got hit with this illness and it really made me examine my life especially my finances. Since I couldn’t function like I used to and was on medication it really made me realize how debilitating this illness is and how my parents won’t be around forever. I had to sort this out and do something about it. I started small and got into personal finance books, self help and investing. I began to educate myself and slowly built up from there. It takes time and a lot of discipline and patience but over the long term it’s worth it and you will get satisfaction for staying true to your goals. I’m on target to hit a net worth of $100,000 this year and very excited. Just keep it up and I believe in you!!!"
176043329,In my case positives got worse and negatives better

Also, I’m careful about my weight - I take small size meals, I got used on it. But if you want to sleep more, maybe you could try to ask your doctor to give you some 
other antipsychotic pills, because I was more sedated and have longer sleep (12 hours) on some others pills, but, in my case, that was the main reason I’m on Abilify - I don’t want to sleep so long and be sedated."

174352922,"I would like to be able to do more with my days and I actually kind of want to, finally!! But… when I finally got going, pretty soon after I started getting very tired and exhausted. I had more negative symptoms until then really, but at this point where I’d finally get past them, it started feeling like I’m missing something from my brain to be able to recover. I did a lot this summer but I soon got to the point where I just had to take a holiday from it all and I am feeling the effects of exhaustion really bad now. Would tyrosine or something else work for this? I do want to say, I visited this forum years ago and I picked up tips on sarcosine. It did wonders for me. It was like, my brain needed this supplement to finally start learning or relearning things for recovery. This is hard to explain… it’s scientifically proven that it helps with that though. But this is why I’d like to see if supplementing would help in this case too. A bit of background: I had positive symptoms a long tim
e ago, been more negative after that or the positive was so controlled it doesn’t qualify for real positive symptoms anymore. The sarcosine helped lessen the leftover from those that looked kind of bipolar-ish and it helped with negative symptoms too a bit (I wanted it for negative symptoms). Thanks a lot for any input."

And I have seen many people there who, quite frankly, knew what they were doing and just didn’t care. They thought they had it made in the shade because they could act out as much as they want with zero consequences. There were also people who honestly didn’t know what they were doing and were truly not accountable for their actions. None of those people would be capable of holding a debate on why they shouldn’t have to take responsibility for their actions."

PTSD is characterized by things like mood swings, high anxiety, anger issues, flashbacks, avoidance of triggers and things reminding the person of the traumatic event, etc. You get it from being badly traumatized by something. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions and negative symptoms. They are two entirely different illnesses. However, one can get ptsd induced psychosis in which they become psychotic because of the trauma they went through."

176043510,"Chances are that some aspect of schizophrenia will affect you for a very long time. A good recovery is possible but a full, 100% recovery is kind of doubtful. Even experts disagree on what constitutes a full recovery. No matter how good your recovery is, most schizophrenics need medication for life. Some people claim all their symptoms are gone but most of them still need medication to maintain that state. Nevertheless, schizophrenics can still work, go to school, drive, socialize, get married, have kids, travel, have fun etc. Maybe not all those things but many can do at least one of those things or a combination of some of those things and more. Some can, some can’t. I was severely ill from age 19-21 but I still hold a job now at age 59, I drive my own car, take online classes, live pretty much on my own and take care of my business. I don’t know how I do it because before I got sick I couldn’t accomplish sh*t. But I guess I won the schizophrenia lottery. I paid my dues by being diagnosed a
t age 19 and getting stuck in a group home for more than a year with no medication. After that unpleasant experience I ended up being put in a long term hospital for 8 months. It was long ago, in 1981 but I can remember the suffering, the agony, the horror, the tragically weird but sometimes funny behavior of my fellow patients and the intense symptoms during my stay there. So I know what suffering is. But I got out and 9 months later I got a job and stayed there four years. I enrolled myself in college at age 23. Anyways, I’m saying all this to make the point that I was severely ill but now I’m looking back at being employed for most of the last 35 years. I went to work today and our company threw a barbeque for us. It was difficult but I had my moments. At age 59 in some ways I’m getting better, in some ways worse. I can still have fun and participate in life. One bonus in life with schizophrenia is I learned while there are jerks out there in life, I learned most people are cool and friendly. I can s
ee at work that most people are pretty decent and friendly. We all struggle and do the best we can. I wish I had learned this better when I was younger. It would have made life a lot easier for me. But better late than never. Anyways, I hope this helps in some way. It’s hard to ignore schizophrenia but there are ways around it."

I unpack the orders in my garage and then put the outer packaging/boxes straight into the recycle bin. Then I wash my hands. My years of experience dealing with OCD finally come in handy!

176043531,"It was quite unusual to be so paranoid as though I were always a paranoaic. Although Paranoia is a symptom in Paranoid Schizophrenia, there were times when persons would check on things, like channel surfing on TV, or following movies, or making argumentative points like political reactionaries, that although they were allowed to do so revealed that many other people have been Paranoid. In this sense there is one realm like that of skinny depressed people, and in the other realm are symptoms like hypomania, and paranoia. There are too many skinny depressed people who participate in consumer society, like they are just acting out advertising photograpy, or T.V. sitcoms. Another point was that as Paranoia it’s always like I’m slighted by something alluding to that the T.V. is empty and soulless, that sports fans follow treacherous bandwagons, and that school drop outs can feel demoralized with lower self esteem, or issues resembling _PERSON_. There is a lot of paranoia then involved in checking o
n things, like exploring videogames, or searching through movies. There is this allowance for the derogatory connotation like the undead, or zombies, like in Night of the Living Dead. Sometimes it’s annoying to thing unconciously of the comparison with Count _PERSON_, or _PERSON_ for something that should be treated with CBT. And then there is this paranoia like reading of novels, that there could be far off elitists like elite intellectuals in control of the world in alarming ways where a person searches out more fictions. This reading of fictions is quite paranoid that persons are so depressed like in school seating charts, that persons could be checking on novels just to act out against depressives. Allowing for the concept of crucifiction, then, there are very dark moments when persons have forgetten the message of life, like that of revivifying vitalities, and have allowed for some kind of crude wording like reactionaries, showing that their affordances have been challenged by the nature of magic itsel
f, that some magic is true magic, yet not all magic spells succeed. There are benefits then to CBT which outweigh the language of grammatical rules, where some arguments could ruin true magic. Certainly, then there is some paranoia behind western culture’s ecclecticism like with independant arts, that persons could be checking on this out of paranoia, yet this just showed off their feelings of depression, that behind their inquisitiveness into alternative arts there are points where they felt depressed more than they could uphold something as valid, or accurate magic. Actually it could be quite an achievement to succeed with magic at alternative arts although there are so many depressives around it like followers of the arts, the noting the pertinance of CBT, that it allows us to identify the depressives that are in the mode of using the Twilight Zone as a metaphor."

Obviously, there’s self-limitations for everybody and stuff beyond anyone’s control but you have some power and control in your life. If your goal is to socialize then take steps to achieve it. If your goal is to go get a cup of coffee somewhere than take steps to achieve it. You seem like a fairly intelligent individual, you can figure out how to get what you want. And sometimes achieving something doesn’t have to be impossibly difficult. Taking a walk down the street in the morning two or three times a week doesn’t have to be this huge thing.

176043572,I have Been taking CBD Gummies for about two weeks now I was hoping it would help with my anxiety and also help me lose some weight I don’t know if I have been taking it long enough to notice weight loss but been taking one gummy 30 minutes before bed it does help me relax and calm me down but as far as weight loss haven’t noticed any loss but haven’t gained any either so that’s good I gained maybe a few pounds hoping its not because of the CBD may stop it for a few days just to see if that was where the few pounds came from or not if it wasn’t the CBD I will finish it up. My question is can you lose weight with CBD gummies and how much would I have to take to be effective for weightloss how many mg?
176043573,"You need to train yourself out of this kind of thinking. It used to drive me crazy all the time, and I was in the same position as you are. Now those kinds of things don’t bother me, and the less you invest time in thinking about it, the more it slips into the background of your mind. The more attention you pay to these thoughts, the worse it gets. Try and get some therapy, that should help. Maybe even a med change, as it doesn’t seem to be helping you as much as it might be able to."

176043581,It stands for “diagnosed”. I don’t think they place to much emphasis on diagnosis. It’s more just a starting place to begin treatment. They give the same drugs for many different diagnoses. I’ve been on a lot of different drugs.

I don’t have a lot of money but I live at home so I can sort of save some. I’m going to have to tighten the belt and become more frugal in the future when my mom is older but it wouldn’t hurt to get started now. For now though I’m exercising I’ve started to get back a little bit of my desires to do things, even if I start to get tired immediately when I start to do them. I think life could be worse."

No akathisia, no nausea. My positive symptoms are better than 120mg Latuda. On Latuda I would get paranoid and hear mean voices/dreams while watching the news. Not on Risperdal.

When I was 20 I gave a superficial answer to the question. “Oh, they get along alright.” I’d say when actually, I had forgotten them. Now, at 75, I realize the difficulties they had. They stayed married for 53 years. Once, when I was 6, my Mom wrote my Dad a letter stating she’d like to separate. But she never sent the letter. Too much for a proud New Englander. You often tell me I should get my mind off the past. But the past is what made me who I am. I could guard my tongue better and will as I realize the intense affect my parents had on me."

174352964,It was making me anxious/restless/psychotic kinda. But my pdoc wasn’t sure it was a good combination to start. He said “the combination of drugs are not studied well enough” And abilify wasn’t doing it for me. But then I found out naltrexone and Zoloft were better than adding a second antipsychotic. Lol ignore me I have no relevant opinion on these meds. But I did take Latuda for two days back in 2015

176043644,I’m not sure if I’ve hit my worst it’s pretty much like a roller coaster ride for me! But basically I went missing for 6 hours one time and the cops found me we blood coming out of my ears which I couldn’t explain how that happened cause I literally had no clue!
176043645,I hope it comes through for you _AT_MENTION_ . It’s nice to be able to survive with little stress. Money can be a big stressor in modern life!

This is based on a philosophy by _PERSON_.) I know that combatting your fears of socialisation could be seriously difficult, but what interests you hobby wise? You can’t battle your fears by hiding away. Getting out there by joining a rambling club, art club etc. could be a start. At university there might even be social anxiety club. You won’t know until you search it out. Sports even., languages perhaps. Good luck in your search!"

Not sure if some more of the self check-outs aren’t accepting cash. I was glad I got a gallon of orange juice, some bananas and lots of herbal tea. I used Instacart at another store last week because I was home sick but it was pretty expensive."
176043652,"I was diagnosed with it by a medical doctor. Several of them. Looking at it logically, there’s no way an alien civilization would put the resources into monitoring me that I imagined they were. I’m just not that important. Neither are you, by the way."

176043659,"I think several alien species abducted me and did experiments on me and drove me insane and gave me special abilities. It wasn’t just aliens though. Humans too. I get memories that I had my mind uploaded to the internet and computer and stuff like that. I had a confirmed 7,000 and something past iterations of ME in this body and life reliving my past like a causal loop or time loop. Sort of like Edge of Tomorrow or something like that. Maybe travelers, Source Code, and a few other movies. I watched the trailer of “Transcendence” but not too interested in buying the movie. Scary stuff. I have trauma. They took me (the aliens) (possibly _PERSON_) (and others) took me out of the Matrix a few times and let me control it for a bit. I put in on repeat for specific reasons. That’s why I identify as an immortal (alien?) and time travel and computer simulator. They told me stuff but it took millions or more past lifetimes (like quantum immortality/many worlds theory of quantum mechanics) to figure w
hy I was being experimented on and suffering and being abudcted so many times. I think I’m originally from a parallel universe a completely different one, but I’m not sure. Perhaps, I was cloned. I was told a lot of things and a lot of lies and disinformation that confused me. I went insane. I could write a book or two or perhaps more but have concerns and am a private person (used to be). While I don’t know if Many worlds theory is true, the guy who invented it thought it gave him/made him immortal. Unfortunately/fortunately, I remember billions or more past life or iterations as ME (_NAME_) as a paranoid schizophrenic with no past or existence before 2011/2012. I keep resurrecting back in time around the year 2013 via soul transfer I think."
176043660,"It’s really scary…I wanted kids my whole life but then when my mental illness stuff got seriously bad I thought I couldn’t handle it and decided to never have kids…but now that I have this person I want to spend the rest of my life with who would be such an amazing dad its changed my mind and I want kids again…but I am soooo scared just of how hard it will be…especially in the beginning when I have to be off of all medication…even if there are alternative meds they claim are ok I don’t want to risk it. To those who have had kids how was it for you in the beginning when you had to go off meds? How did you do it? I feel I’ll need a lot of family support and of course my partner will be super supportive, if I didnt think he would be I wouldnt be ok with having kids in the first place."

176043706,"For some people there’s a comfort in feeling special or singled out, and letting go of the idea of that, which is an important step in letting go of the persecutory delusions, is a difficult step to take. If you aren’t special in an objective way, it’s far easier to accept that there is a very low chance of other people spending their weekend trying to read your mind instead of relaxing with friends and family. But these delusions typically go hand in hand with delusions of grandeur of some sort, about being a savior, of knowing a dangerous truth, being powerful or exceptional in some way, etc, and letting go of those to be able to get relief from the other is a scary prospect the more attached somebody is to the delusion of being singled out or special. Life is very much an embodiment of balance, and even in the case of delusional manifestations of reality we can’t exactly have our cake and eat it too. Therapy can help reduce the desire to pick the fiction over the reality, and AP can help 
reduce the variability of the thinking in the first place. But it’s very, very difficult to pull oneself out of delusional thinking on one’s own, and simply being told something isn’t real isn’t sufficient, as an agile mind can jump through hoops to re-manifest a delusion despite mountains of contradictory evidence. As an example, many people that don’t suffer from sz will believe that their phone is listening to their conversations and creating targeted ads. You see this story every few months pop up, with people being concerned. Having worked in advertising, I tell people that this isn’t actually happening, that the battery drain from constant listening would cause people to uninstall the app, and that basic data harvesting from other sources is sufficient to target those ads. Do they listen? Sometimes, but usually not, and they discount my experience, my reasoning, and stick with their gut that “yeah, but there’s no way they could have known about it if it wasn’t listening, we tested it.
 Ok. Sure. So the computer security and privacy advocates that actually hook their phones up to network inspecting software and test the theory and find no results somehow missed the truth, but the fact you talked about “diapers” (it’s always diapers) with your friend and suddenly saw an ad was the smoking gun, even though your cousin had a baby shower three months ago and you were searching for baby gifts and forgot about it. (_USER_ID_: Just to be clear, this is the case with major apps - malware/spam apps absolutely could do something like this, and the battery drain argument has become less of an issue in the past few years because of API changes, but there’s very little to be gained from doing so. The degree of targeting from existing data profiles is sufficient enough that no large firm would risk the backlash to add this into their apps). Letting go of ideas, accepting that we might be wrong - it’s extremely difficult for everyone. So it would make sense that for people that naturally have 
a difficult time distinguishing truth from fiction would have an even more difficult time doing so."
176043707,This doesn’t really make sense to me and seems to be theorizing based off of your own personal experience as opposed to psychosis as a whole.

176043713,"Last I got weighed was when I went in for a psych assessment (again) and it was 133. I don’t know how much I’ve lost, but the difference is obvious. Been exercising more doing push-ups and sit-ups daily. It’s helped a lot. But mostly cutting back on sugar and excess carbs seems like the biggest help. I still drink coffee some days, but I don’t put any sugar in it. Just add cinnamon and some cocoa powder and that gives it some flavor. Of course non-dairy creamers also help but we haven’t had any lately. I also still enjoy some baked goods, but there are healthier alternatives like these awesome teff mocha muffins. They got pretty good flavor for little sugar added; I put about 2 teaspoons. Only hope they’ll renew my food stamps again so I can get more groceries. Kind of just scraping by with little (probably secretly begrudging…) help. But anyway, it’s hard not to want to give into binge eating because of emotional problems right now… It’s been such a bad habit and a culprit for

Few studies have focused on physical health outcomes for those prescribed long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and other cardio-metabolic risk factors in a large cohort prescribed LAI and managed by community mental health services. For participants with elevated cardio-metabolic risk factors, the proportion receiving appropriate management was assessed. Of the 301 eligible participants, many met the full criteria for MetS (44%) and its components. Cardio-metabolic risk factors were largely under- or un-treated. Smoking rates were ve
ry high (62%) along with reported high rates of physical inactivity and poor dietary intake. The vast majority (89%) reported seeing their general practitioner in the preceding twelve months. Individuals prescribed LAI have a very high prevalence of MetS and potentially modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Routine monitoring accompanied by evidence-based treatment of cardiometabolic abnormalities which contribute to significant morbidity, disability and premature death should be prioritised. Better collaboration between mental health services and primary care providers should be pursued to optimise the delivery of effective physical health care to individuals living with SMI."

I have experienced a lot of unusual things, but I don’t want to be conspiratorial in my conceptualization of it. So I tell myself—perceptions and beliefs shape our open-minded ness to others and our abilities to understand or relate. So even without medication—the major concern is I won’t sleep for days and I become manic/dysphoric if I don’t find a tool to ground my realiity. But with medication, reality-still is slipping sort of. The need to have something to fall back to—is lacking, I don’t have an idea of what the normal reality was meant to look like, because even as a little girl I was philosophizing life after death and staring at flowers in the rain. So is merely being eccentric and un
usual (not special) just unable to fit the mold what schizophrenia is? Can we go even deeper? Seeing things others cant see even if you can confirm their existence? But other people can’t because their consciousness is not evolved enough to even accept the existence of such phenomena? IE time travel, multiple levels of reality/hypnosis, weather control, prayer, intention, energy-manipulation, being in sync so much you think or feel like you’re psychic—because things constantly are confirmed that match the subconscious internal with the outward material?

Not sure why people meander around threads that they don’t like or that trigger them especially if they cannot handle good civil discourse and open thought and that threatens their fragile tiny self. For god-sake the topic itself is taboo and doesn’t really exist. This forum is funny sometimes like who runs it and what not and the “special people” who are here often that think they are king. I honestly believe and know most of what I say. I’ve been wrong before. I have a mile wide drawer in my mind full of memory bank junks that I want to get rid of and let out. I find this forum is the best way to do it over time. Maybe it’s best to try and not to figure out and harp about who targeted me in college. It was 
so bad that I think it was reptilian aliens who had me abducted but then I doubt it sometimes – like was it fake and then or was it a _PERSON_ thing? I have memories that are non-linear and not from this reality too so there’s that. I don’t know it seems so vast and conspiratorial that I shouldn’t really care and it shouldn’t really matter. I believe and am thankful I live in a modern society with modern conveniences and a semi-open society with other schizophrenics I can talk to online because without you guys I would be a big mess or possibly even catatonic at best… I’m pretty sure something fishy is going on and goes on. I mean I just am a big mess. It could have been better, it could have been worse. Mine was definitely a hell-like nightmarish experience and for what end? for what purpose? I have no clue. I’m starting to gain insight and better knowledge through stuff. I think some aliens are positive and some are negative. Our government isn’t really that great. It used to be, but not t

176043929,Everyone goes through it I really think. A good question is why some ‘do it’. But a better question is ‘Why doesn’t everyone do it’. At least that’s what my former therapist wrote in a book.

Basically I should log how much of it I do each day in the hope that it will edge me on to do a tiny bit more each week or so…

176043974,"so, ive been gone for a long time now. i felt like i couldnt post because i was trying to make a difference in people’s lives thru political activism, which as i found out, is not just good intentions and kind people. It’s power hungry people, opportunists, enablers, bullies, constant conflict and in-fighting, and sometimes even abuse. Also, i know the no-politics rule and left forum for a while. I eventually burned out due to mistreatment and retreated into a reclusive lifestyle, but during the pandemic i returned briefly with an org i had quit to try to make amends with people i had gotten to know and trust, then distrust over the course of several years. it went badly. a person who i was close to for a year before an ugly fall out was exposed this month as being a perv and emotionally abusive. the fall out is ongoing. we had been close, then did not speak for a year, then had made apologies a bit, though we were never close again. i had trusted him for a while though, and still hearing his b
ehavior was a shock to me. i had sensed a dark streak as I have one too, but nothing like that, and i def didnt see him saying/behaving the way he did to his romantic partners. I have learned that while i want to get things done and help people, not all people claiming they want to help people are trustworthy. in fact, i have learned that a lot of normies are not trustworthy. it was a painful realization and also made me see that i am still not a normie, no matter how many people i fool into not seeing the skitzy aspects of my thought process. i have trust issues with normies now. normies often have not acknowledged their own darkness, flaws, and errors and go about acting like they’re role models. Most of us skitzes are all too aware of our flaws and our internal issues. We’re not better than, im just saying i have noticed many normies are diff in their self-perception than skitzes. like, they have their own set of illusions about how their actions impact people,just like we have our delusions and social 
deficits. i am in a lot of stress and have started taking the hydroxyzine pam i rarely take for anxiety. i sleep all day. i clean a bit then go back to sleep. i feel like i entered some horrible normie gauntlet and came out in pieces."

174353048,"I have paranoia on lower doses, I tried 3mg for a few months. I tried Zyprexa, Abilify, Seroquel (for sleep), Latuda and Risperdal. Zyprexa didn’t work at 15-20mg. On Latuda I had some positive symptoms. Just the 20mg Abilify worked for both negative and positive symptoms, I think bcz its a partial dopamine agonist. But I had to stop Abilify after 8 years due to worsening side effects, addictions and hypersexuality. I am so stuck and unlucky, my only hope is the only other partial dopamine agonist, Vraylar."
176043977,Yes. I haven’t had symptoms in almost going on a year. Spent a year in the state hospital because my mother lied to the doctor. For a while there I thought I had joined the army in the past. I really do have a past life like that but it wasn’t the army. Just going on memories in my mind. I’m at peace with it. I’m on medication and doing well. Quit smoking but haven’t left the house in months other than to go for a drive or to the beach. I think I’m doing okay. If it comes back I think I can beat it. The hospital was uncomfortable and really boring I sat in bed and read. I also worked a job in the greenhouse though. That was nice.

I get a bit of a break during the summer (symptom wise) but the fall and winter can be hard. Just today I started getting depressed in the afternoon. I probably won’t be able to go to my cousin’s wedding tomorrow because of the whole anxiety thing so that’s the sort of thing that bothers me more than getting a check every month from a system I paid into. It’s there if a person needs it and qualifies for it and I can’t say I’m sorry tbh.

I also heard classical music when sleeping. Recently, I’ve been getting phone calls in my sleep. I think it’s not real, but sometimes I question it. Like my phone just picks up text messages or phone calls with no record. I either answer it when it rings or it talks automatically.

Also my memory gets better and I dont feel angry that I’m forgetting things I can sleep better and I can actually relax. I’m beginning to think I dont need this medication due to this as the jittery ness is making me depressed. I have my next one on Monday and am dreading it. I dont want to go but Ive already agreed to it due to not being able to see the psychiatrist and my nurse wants me to go. What will happen if I dont go. ? I dont believe I have a community order to go. I am on injection due to non compliance and forgetting to take my medication. Will the police come to my house if I dont go that is what I have heard could happen. Someone told me this but it wasnt my nurse or psychiatrist.

176044091,"A diagnosis is just a name people thought of to put on a cluster of behaviour they see. It doesnt really have any worth. It is not like a real medical diagnosis, where they actually know what is wrong and test and prove that. Take a diagnosis with a grain of salt. They see behaviour in you that is different than average and they put names on that. Oftentimes doctors dont even agree on a diagnosis. I had so many varying diagnoses i lost count.

176044116,Sounds good _AT_MENTION_ !

176044118,"If I sleep early, I wake up around 7-8 am. I make coffee and smoke my vape and check Instagram messages. I reply to emails and work for a few hours. If I have to drop off shipping I do. I smoke more and have another coffee. I eat something. I spend my day at my desk. I clean. I go to the gym, come home shower, spend more time at my desk. Chat away."

176044124,Me thinks I’m bipolar. Or sza. Yet lithium was a sugar pill for me almost. It may have done something but I took it for a year actually. And the first 6 months I was on zyprexa which kept me stable. Then I went off the zyprexa but stayed on lithium and lamictal Wellbutrin and klonipin and I had the craziest psychotic episode ever. Got arrested thought I was _NAME_ splitting the Red Sea when I drove through the middle of the road and cars peeled to the side like I was splitting the sea. Then they threw the book at me. Then during recovery people fed into my delusions. And then finally I recover. But only thanks to this forum and my amazing parents and pdoc. Definitely no thanks to the court system or lithium for that matter lol. … sorry I’m humoring myself with this post. But one friend says lithium is the best med for him. He’s currently off all meds. He thinks after ten psychiatric hospitalizations he’s gonna be ok not on meds??? He seems fine now but give him a month I worry about how re
ckless this kid is. But yeah he says lithium works for him?? But he also says he has no mental illness but he definitely seems to have one. I worry about all my friends except my friend _NAME_ who really cleaned up his act it seems.
176044125,"I don’t know that my advice would work for you. I’m asexual, so for me I have almost never been physically attracted to a person. With Mr. Star though, I didn’t find him attractive until like 3 months into the relationship. I have heard from abuse survivors that they needed to rewire their brains after leaving their abusive relationship, because the extreme emotions in an abusive relationship are so intense that normal love and support seems flat and boring in comparison. For me, not being attracted to Mr. Star wasn’t a dealbreaker because I wasn’t attracted to ANYONE. Even so, several months in I started wanting to try physical intimacy with him. We took it very slow. I can go into more detail if you PM me about it, because those details are not appropriate for all ages. But with gradual exposure therapy, I got over my trauma response to being touched, and now I actively enjoy it. We don’t have traditional PIV sex often, but we are frequently intimate in other ways."
176044126,We all have a job to do in this world and that is to keep living even if life gets tough. Give the good fight and resist the devil.

174353091,"The black box warning on abilify was added in I believe 2016. If you took it before then, you may have a case. I believe they already settled a class action suit, but the payout money may still be available. That said, I don’t think it is probably worth the hassle. I had to sue my worker’s comp company for refusal to pay, and it was a nightmare process for barely any money."

174353109,Zinc always helps my schizophrenia. It doesn’t cure it but it certainly helps.
176044142,Some real nice guitar work in that “In a daydream” song. Might check some others of theirs out. Hadn’t heard of _NAME_ band before either. The track I heard had some like military style snare rolls which I really like generally.
176044143,Perhaps you could direct me to a proper philosophical discussion or authorative bibliography on the subject at hand. I wouldn’t want to be wasting my time on the pseudo stuff.

176044162,"10 mgs Abilify pills and nothing else right now. I’m actually feeling better on the lower dose and not being on the Aristada anymore. Part of me thinks it would be so much easier to be on the injection, less instability, but I will have no motivation. It’s a difficult line to find the right dose and everything. I have considered trying something more strong than Abilify. To be honest, it does not do a lot other and its effects are transient. My psychiatrist doesn’t want to change anything at all. But I think I could use the addition of Seroquel or Risperdal, and Vraylar or a mood stabilizer."

176044174,"Reality is full of events that happen. We may sense some of these events, either in part or in their entirety. Those events that we either fully or partially sense, are events that we are made aware of. If we only sense parts of these events, then our brain attempts to fill in the gaps to create a full picture that can help shape our understanding of these events. The way in which our brain fills in these gaps, is by looking at past beliefs or experiences, that themselves may have been formed from either partial or full awareness of external events. Some of these partially sensed events may have been accompanied by some contextual information that helped our mind to frame them and understand them. Our mind attempts to find patterns between new events that we are becoming aware of, and those that we have previously experienced. Where a pattern is found (within a given threshold), we form a new understanding, and possibly belief, from this new information. Or we adjust our existing beliefs based on t
his new information. My hypothesis is that there are some external influences that can adjust (or lower) the threshold by which we pattern match new events to historical events or beliefs. Such external influences may include psychoactive substances, stress and psychosocial disempowerment 6 (which in itself, creates stress), genetic predisposition, or damage caused by viruses. This threshold is effectively governed by our “filters” – pre-established sub-conscious beliefs that filter out the noise. Sometimes, the lowering of this threshold allows us to identify patterns that we wouldn’t normally find – and we are able to become aware of new ideas because of this. This might be why we have business leaders in Silicon Valley, like _NAME_, micro-dosing “acid” (LSD). To improve their awareness and pattern detection capabilities. But in other instances, perhaps the threshold is lowered just a little too much – and we experience delusions."

Instead of being beaten over the hood of the cop car that night (like I had been before) I was cuffed and put in the back seat and taken to a mental hospital where I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated. That was the beginning of the end of my 10 years of terror living in the dark world of paranoid delusions and hallucinations. I got lucky that night. The cop that picked me up was a great guy. Years later when I recovered I wrote a letter to his Sargeant and thanked him. After going through that, after I was told by the psychiatrist that I had schizophrenia I thought, Whoa, that kinda explains things, I guess that’s a maybe, or maybe not, I’ll have to think about that.

174353127,"It is common for people with schizophrenia to isolate. Part of the problem is that because of the disease it makes doing the simplest things hard. While you wake up in the morning and throw on some pants and a shirt and dart out for the store for a gallon of milk and maybe hit the post office afterwards and maybe stop at the dry cleaners on the way back and think nothing of it, for us doing just one of those things is a big project for us. That’s a typical morning for you and you don’t think twice about it. But we’re battling symptoms that at the least, make us self conscious in public, and at the most it can make us extremely uncomfortable and paranoid. And anyone, schizophrenic or not, does not want to feel uncomfortable in everything they do. And knowing ourselves what is going to happen when we go out just makes us try to avoid those situations. And the problem in fact doubles when (to us) we look at everybody around us and they seem so together and normal and at ease in everything they d
o. Of course most people aren’t doing as good as they look like, but they sure look like it. Sure fear plays a part in us wanting to isolate. Lot’s (or even most) of us are paranoid and fearful of other people. We perceive danger where there is none. I’m making everything sound gloomy and hopeless but for most of us, life is not always that bad. Good thing can still happen for us. Despite our illness, many schizophrenics can do the following things. We may be only to do one of them alright or a combination of these things. Schizophrenics: can marry and have kids, attend college, hold down a paid or volunteer job, drive, exercise, travel, go to concerts, live independently, help others, take care of pets, go to parties, babysit, clean, cook, have a hobby, read…And the list goes on and on. You’re son may not be there yet to do these things but he has a fighting chance. I wish I could give you some good advice but I just wanted to give you a little hope for your sons future. There is no overnight cure 
for schizophrenia, it can take many months or even years to show progress. But being medication compliant is a big hurdle for lots of schizophrenics so your son is lucky in that regard. I’m 58 years old, I got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when I was 19. The first two years were hell and I barely functioned. At 19 I was put in my first group home. For the next year I was psychotic and did not work or go to school. I had no car and no money. I had no friends or a girlfriend. I spent most days hanging out in the kitchen or walking to a used book store I discovered and browsing books for a couple of hours. I took walks and I was lucky enough to have two sisters who would take me out to coffee with them. (maybe that’s an idea for you and your son, or maybe a quiet library). I was often suicidal and felt hopeless and the disease just tormented me every waking moment. I was symptomatic every minute of every day for a year. After the group home my next stop was inside a large psychiatric facility for 8 m
onths with many shady, dangerous people. I should say here that the reason I am telling you my story is to show you where I came from and where I am now. I want to show you what is possible despite having schizophrenia, but I’ll get to that in a minute. I should also say here, I was a very naïve 20 year old. I grew up in a nice city and my family was middle class and I had a childhood of playing sports with my friends and hanging out in front of our houses talking and fooling around and doing fun things like riding our bikes to go fishing or hiking. But anyways, the hospital was hell too, I never felt like it helped me. The day I moved out to live into a nice group home my parents found, I felt as crazy as the day I walked into the hospital. I’ll cut to the chase. At age 58 I am looking back on being employed for the past 35 years albeit mostly part time. Even at my age I am still taking classes to get my two year degree. My degree will not get me a job but I am doing it for my (and my families) satisfac
tion. I have owned a car and driven since 1998. I lived independently for 20 years and six years of that I lived alone in a nice studio. I have flown across the country coast to coast three times and a few other places. I was best man at my dads wedding. I used to drive alone to Sacramento to visit my dad, a trip that was 190 miles away and took me two hours (one way). I’ve done many fun things. Right now I am living in a nice apartment and I’ve been at my janitors job for 5 years. I get myself up three days a week and drive through traffic to get there. I take care of myself fairly well but my sisters give me a hand sometimes. I manage my own money, I pay bills and I don’t owe anyone a dime. But anyone looking at me when I was twenty and living in the group home and the hospital would never have dreamed that I would ever do anything in “life” again. In the group home I slept in a small room on a dirty mattress thrown on the floor. I was usually dirty. For those first two years there was no sign tha
t I would ever be able to function again; I was seriously, seriously ill. I saw no light at the end of the tunnel. I never planned for the future because it seemed impossible that I would ever do anything. My story is why there is hope and that no one should give up on someone with schizophrenia. Looking back on knowing and living with mentally ill people for most of the 1980’s and half of the 1990’s, I found that most schizophrenics have potential. It may not be apparent for a long time but I have seen too many fellow schizophrenics who looked hopeless but they end up getting jobs or girlfriends etc., I have seen this too many times to give up on myself or others. If you have schizophrenia and you are still young I would just advise not to rush things. Start off small and take small steps. Do things that you have a good chance ofv succeeding to get a little confidence in yourself. Than gradate to bigger goals. I’m sorry you and your son are in this situation but many, many schizophrenics have some kind 
of recovery. It just takes time and support and patience. The progress might be in increments but recovery is a reality. I wish you good luck and I hope you get something out of this. Good luck."

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and quetiapine in the treatment of first episode of psychosis at 3-year follow-up.From October 2005 to January 2011, a prospective, randomized, open-label study was undertaken. Two hundred-two first-episode, drug-naïve patients were randomly assigned to aripiprazole (n=78), ziprasidone (n =62), or quetiapine (n=62) and followed-up for 3 years. The primary effectiveness measure was all cause of tre
atment discontinuation. In addition, an analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle was conducted in the analysis for clinical efficacy.The overall dropout rate at 3 years reached 19.3%. Treatment discontinuation rates were significantly different among treatment groups (aripiprazole=73.08%, ziprasidone=79.03%, and quetiapine=95.16%) (?2=11.680; P=.001). Statistically significant differences in terms of nonefficacy, nonadherence, and side effects were observed among treatment groups along the 3-year follow-up determining significant differences in time to all-cause discontinuation (log-rank=32.260; P=.001). Significant differences between treatments were found in the categories of sleepiness/sedation (?2=9.617; P=.008) and increased sleep duration (?2=6.192; P=.004). No significant differences were found in the profile of extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients on aripiprazole were more likely to be prescribed benzodiazepines.First-episode psychosis patients on quetiapine were more likely to discontinue trea
tment due to nonefficacy. Identifying different discontinuation patterns may contribute to optimize treatment selection after first episode of psychosis."

176044280,"Ahaha! Years ago I purchased the Shades of Grey Trilogy. I think those are the only books I didn’t send to my mom’s kindle, not so much because of the erotic content but because of the awful writing. The funny thing is that I was only able to get through part of the first book myself, because the books were written so poorly, I just couldn’t stand the cringe-worthy literary style. I purchase mainly Scandinavian mysteries and my mom regularly complains about that genre but then she reads the books faster than I can and I have to keep reminding her to not to give away the ending of books she’s read because I often haven’t read them yet."

176044305,Well i could not quit smoking with chantix. The only thing that worked for me was to gradually smoke less cigarettes until I got down to1 per day and then 0 per day. You need to start and get the nicotine out of your system. That is the only way I could get rid of my craving for cigarettes. I sucessfully quit smoking Feb. 2018.

The best thing for me to do is to get up and start doing something else to take my concentration off the voices, then they usually fade away. Or, better yet, call someone up on the phone and get into a conversation. That always shuts up the voices."

Wtf at all these people in my area who never heard of Italy. Am I being ridiculous? I don’t think so. CA has stay at home orders."
176044312,I have a similar story. I had severe acne in HS and it really affected my confidence with girls. I thought I grossed them out—I feel like that affected me for years even after the acne cleared up—I think the middle school/HS years is when you connect psychologically with dating and such and if that is messed up it makes it harder to connect with woman later on in life (well the ones I am interested in) maybe I am wrong. I was bullied a lot too in MS and HS too—never been to a HS reunion because its all about talking about your career and such. My 20’s were interesting too but I had a 5 year somewhat respite in the military but had a psychotic break at the age of 27 (long story)…I got out of the military at age 23…I had other disease thst I think affected my mental health but either way I made decisions that led to a psychotic break at age 27… I don’t know what to say now really…just wanted to say I could relate. Acne and bullying suck.

I rarely see my extended family but perhaps this could be the outcome as the names are the same, it really is tricky, so much history is encoded in names or labels, my book is entirely factual plus some philosophy. I don’t understand what you mean by gender issues, I have always looked after both men and women, roughness as espoused by so called pickup artists is not my fault, unless this whole world is in my imagination, my ego is a messenger, the assertion that the logos is Christ is in my opinion the origin of the violence, my father’s name, Christakis and my cousin’s father’s name Christomakis, cannot be both the father and son and the holy spirit, that is chauvinism.

My social life has gone to basically zero and Mr. Star has been working mostly overnights so I haven’t seen him much. On top of that, a relative has come forward to claim the kids, and now I have to start transitioning them into their new home. It breaks my heart, because we have all grown so close and I’ve seen them come such a long way from the terrified little kids who first came to live with me. It’s good for them though, because they will get to be with their older siblings. I just don’t want my family to be split up. Foster care is certainly a roller coaster of emotions! If anyone has some words of encouragement or advice for me, I would love to hear them."

You don’t want to be mean."
174353151,"I have been on Olanzapine, Abilify, Latuda, Haldol, Risperidone and now Amisulpride. I refused Clozapine as it was too similar to the side effects of Olanzapine. I am currently on 1000mg of Amisulpride, 10mg of Olanzapine PRN and 15mg of Diazepam PRN. All these drugs are propping me up at work at the moment and without them I’d be a mess. Handling side effects has been messy. On Haldol I had to also take procyclidine 20mg and 30 mg of diazepam. I am glad I came off that drug as it gave me horrible EPS symptoms. I was only on 10mg. I was first given Olanzapine but after two years I went cold turkey as it made me put on 35 kilos, and I was a zombie much of the time and yet had to work. Abilify made me not be able to sleep, and I was a bag of nerves on it I couldn’t tolerate risperidone as it made me feel sick. Latuda worked for 18 months, but then I got restlessness from it and had to come off as it was extreme. I am hopeful on Amisulpride. It’s a good drug. I get no side effects from it, but p
rolactin is an potential issue that may occur."

As a non acute, middle aged person with SMI, there was, to put it bluntly,sod all support. I had one home visit in 12 years. That is very much par for the course for non acute service users. I was independent, but basically self neglecting. My stepdaughter was concerned, but lived 3-4 hours away.She tried to get me to move to be near her. I was too anxious to do so. It took being told my block of flats was going to be demolished to anxiously agree to move near her. Now I live independently in a smaller,but more appropriately sized,flat.

I see on here so many times that people want to hear people agree with them no matter what. How does that help in any way for someone that wants to live in reality? I get what you’re saying on the mixed feelings, but it’s just not healthy to Think people can read your thoughts to the point of suicidal thoughts.

My former stepmother raised me too and she has been my rock and more than I can explain. I also pray she will be 90 or more. And my dads wife too n that they stay happily married. They are still not easy going and they are still complicated and difficult but it’s much easier to be with them now than when I was a child. The things said to me etc broke my heart deeply. It seriously did. I don’t think my parents are the ones I love most. I believe I love my sacred neigh more than them. I believe I love my x boyfriend in SA and his dogs as much if not more and my former stepmother too. I could be wrong but think so. I can tell my dad pretty much anything.

They are great parents and my former stepmother is taking such good care of me. I’m well taken care of thankfully. I don’t know how I would cope without them. I’m pretty dependent on them.

As far as drugs goes, i don’t do drugs. I smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, but in a “safe” quantity. I don’t overdo it because i tend to lose my brain if i am too drunk (i am not violent, but i tend to do crazy stuff like rolling on the floor, running everywhere, jump against walls etc.). I had a friend who fell into hard drugs and it completely traumatized me to see the state he was in. So I have no curiosity or desire to get wasted on drugs, be it weed or any other stuff. I thank you deeply for your answers, it’s nice to have a comunity like this. You guys are awesome."

Specially if you plan on having sex with this girl again. To remove genital warts may require surgery. I’m not overly keen on warts and don’t want them but thankfully they don’t hurt.

Habits can’t be eliminated instead only can be replaced with other. Whether its good or bad its your choice."

The goal isn’t to judge how seemingly miniscule one act is versus another or to out do each other. Every act counts, regardless of how small it may seem. If anyone has a bad day and does an act of kindness, please post how it made you feel after the act of kindness versus before.

174353208,"Let us go beyond the use of the word “schizophrenia” or “psychosis”,and speak directly about the new psychological structure that emerged,embodied and settled in the human nature at the height of youth age,vitality and autoimmune ! the condition that you talk about it under the term sz or psychosis or else It is a psychological life of a non-human creature ,extremely hostile towards the human being It causes great damage (change /disorder in thought,emotion and behavior) if it appears itself and practices its functional activities in temporal /spatial dimension of the conscious psychological state of the human being Therefore,sz condition in itself is a free /independent psychological self but not related a human creature The condition is one that embodied its morphological features in the basic nature of the human host without the help /contribution or complicity of any biological,psychological or environmental factors What is happens ? A sudden appearance for a living manifestations of a 
new psychological self within the human nature The human host does not feel the classic symptoms of the diseases that usually accompanies the infection with the various diseases Rather,unexpectedly,the host feels a manifestations of a strange living psychological entity (s) It radiated from the inner deep and penetrated the spatial /temporal dimension for the conscious state,connected (linked with ) with it and become a part of the human psychological self by force,with the failure of autoimmune mechanisms measures to prevent the penetration process,whereas the host feels that there is a strange self that exists and acts inside his own psychological world When the condition appears in the awareness state of the host (first timing),it becomes like a foreign body that has settled in the host’s psychological self without the present of immune mechanisms that working against it Until the moment of taking the first therapeutic dose of medical intervention All of this means that,the sz condition does not exist or 
locating in the biological structure of the host,but its located in the psychological self of the host and practices its interfered functions ,it means that the sz condition linking ONLY with the psychological components without corresponding linkage with the biological background !!! It means,the sz condition effects on the psychological components and the reactions will transmitted to the chemical background of the host ,while the vice versa does not work ! anyway,the immune system has needs a time (2-4 weeks) to made a solution towards the strange body who is linking with the psychological components by makes it a part from the human psychological self - in order to safe the life of the human host !!"

point. It’s cheaper than cigarettes from the get go. 12$ for two pods and the device… and I’m on day 4 of using it. So it’s already saved me 16$… This pod should last me until tomorrow night… then 10 dollar refills from there… save me about 35 a week…which is good. I am tired of being so poor. 10 dollars every 5 days is far better than 7 or 8 every morning.

174353219,"Back in May until start of July 2018, I had a supposed “psychotic episode” according to my psychiatrist. It started off as what felt like an emotional breakdown. It was the last night of college before summer started and I wasn’t in a good mood/drinking as much as my friends. The next day on the train home I had a very low mood and felt myself spacing out. When I arrived into my parents I broke down in front of them, close to tears trying to explain what was wrong with me. I don’t fully recall what I said but I was saying things like my mum and her sisters were all competing against each other (family wise), that me and my friends were never socialised, I was worried that my friends didn’t really like me because I had an eccentric personality, I thought I had borderline personality disorder and I was stressed about getting a summer job (I felt I 100% had to get one). I also confessed to my parents that I took half a pill of MDMA about a month beforehand. What followed after this I can’t 
remember the full timeline but I’ll mention everything that happened: Constant low mood, worst I’ve ever experienced. Literal loss of pleasure in everything I once enjoyed and stopped doing them (hygiene, YouTube videos, reading, texting friends and going out) Hypnagogic hallucinations that scared me so much I had to get my dad to sleep in same bed as me. Insomnia for a long time Dissociation feeling on a few occasions, didn’t feel like I was in my body or had any grasp on my surroundings. This went away though Very bad anxiety and zero confidence in. I started a job and felt spaced out and anxious when dealing with customers on check out. I quit after 3 days due to the stress it caused me. The boss told my mum I was like a “rabbit in headlights” Biggest thing for me was the inability to concentrate on anything like TV and reading. The World Cup was on at the time and I could literally take in nothing. Just sitting in front of TV with a racing mind. Ruminating a lot about everything. Very negative t
houghts nothing positive. When parents tried to give me sleeping pill one night I thought they were trying to poison me (I had come up with an explanation why but I won’t go into that). They eventually persuaded me to take it and I calmed down. Also I thought they were going to maybe push me off a cliff when we were planning to go on a weekend away, but this was a fleeting thought, it didn’t stay with me. (Again I had my own explanation as to why they would) We went on a holiday abroad to Poland and I was very anxious, spacing out a lot and thought someone was following us potentially trying to steal our passports, I had a panic attack about this but my parents calmed me down. don’t know if anyone knows the meaning to this but my dad is a doctor and he reported to my psychiatrist that I had psychomotor retardation. Socially withdrawn in general from friends and family. I wouldn’t go out to a neighbourhood party and became very distressed/angry at my mum for being involved with organising it. On one oc
casion a very strange sensation happened, it’s hard to explain. It was like I was entered into a heightened state of panic/fear. A message popped up on my phone and it didn’t pop up in a normal way, it was like it was popping up in a horror film way - very intense and ominous/threatening. My field of vision as it popped up kinda felt like it had a red tinge to it, very alarming feel to it. This went away almost immediately after though. The interview I had with psychiatrist before being admitted to hospital I remember very little of, but the last question she asked me was about my siblings, I remember being so emotionally exhausted that talking about something simple like that required a lot of effort. The psychiatrist also seemed exhausted from talking to me. I was admitted to hospital and first night just after my parents left I had this big idea in my head that my parents were going to split up because my dad was going to lose his job due to breaking medical rules as a doctor having had me admitted. I 
didn’t sleep the first night. I basically felt I ended up there by mistake and almost felt like a prisoner in ways. The experience was frightening at the time seeing the other unwell patients. It might have been the lack of sleep but while awake in my room there I could hear my dad in the hallway repeating “Hi, I’m _NAME_’s son”. My dad wasn’t there, he was miles away in my relatives house. This didn’t carry on though it was a once off. I was on sertraline and olanzapine 10mg for a few days there. The racing/clouded mind stopped after the few days and it felt like I had my own clear mind back, my own thoughts returned, my independence back. My mood was also good and I felt 100% back to normal, able to concentrate on everything, not ruminating etc. I was told by the psychiatrist (who is a professor also) that I was experiencing psychosis. I was immediately taken off sertraline and kept on olanzapine 10mg. I want to know what’s your opinion on what I experienced. In my opinion it could have just 
been extreme anxiety and depression. As far as psychosis, I’m not sure if what I experienced was voices in the hospital or just my mind playing tricks due to sleep deprivation. Delusions? Maybe the Poland incident but that didn’t last long, it didn’t stay with me. The sertraline or olanzapine (not sure which tbh) did help me to recovery though."

I don’t take meds yet because I’m working on getting insurance, and I’ve been dealing with this particular delusion for months. To me…what helps, is trying to turn this into an opportunity. I get super frustrated sometimes, to think I’m being watched and broadcasted. But what if I can be an example of mental strength and fortitude? What if I can be an example of not reacting negatively to hostility? What if I can give demonstrations on what it means to be a good person? Sure I lose privacy, and get embarrassed easily, but in a way it pushes me to be a better human being. Then I remind myself I can’t possibly be being broadcasted. And I often go back and forth “Am I broadcasted? Am I not? What if I am? What if theres nothing I can do?” I conclude with this: Nothing and no one will steal my joy. Nothing and no one will rob me of my opportunity to live a fulfilled life. And peo

174353235,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/_PHONE_NO_.1695778?needAccess=true ABSTRACT Introduction: Schizophrenia, a devastating disorder with onset in adolescence or young adulthood, afflicts 1% of the population leading to severe social, educational, and occupational impairments. Lumateperone is a first-in-class investigational drug under development for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia. Its unique receptor affinity profile together with synergistic modulation of serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic pathways imparts efficacy over a broad-spectrum of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Areas covered: This narrative drug evaluation includes a review of lumateperone tosylate (lumateperone, ITI-007, ITI-722, Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.) for patients with schizophrenia. This review describes the receptor affinity profile, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, and clinical trials that address how 
lumateperone could potentially emerge as an important therapeutic option for schizophrenia patients. Expert opinion: The unique pharmacological properties of lumateperone may provide the key to dramatically ameliorate the symptoms of schizophrenia as indicated by some clinical trials. Future clinical trials may be enhanced by the administration of more comprehensive long-term behavioral measures and utilization of molecular imaging to confirm the target engagement of the many possible sites of action. The results of ongoing and future studies will provide the evidence to determine if lumateperone will revolutionize the therapy of schizophrenia."

Some of these CNVs increase the risk of developing schizophrenia by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. The genes CRHR1 and CRHBP have been shown to be associated with a severity of suicidal behavior."""

They would want to see you celebrating life. It sounds like she was celebrating life for a while before her tragic passing, trying to live to the fullest. Please don’t fear and convince yourself that something “will” happen, or “when”. It’s ok to have a healthy respect for the fact everything can change, but like many things, over observance can lead us to madness. I think you could benefit greatly when your therapy kicks in.

They seriously don’t know. I know what’s real. I refuse to post certain things on facebook or go to conspiracy sites because of past life lessons and learning. I feel like I identify here more. I was permanently banned from “Wrongplanet” for unknown reasons and I forgot. I didn’t like the admin or made a joke about him. They also refuse to delete my photos and posts there. Maybe I was too flirty with the women there? lol.
176044756,I had a bad dystonic reaction to haldol
176044757,"okay thanks, i appreciate it."
176044758,I’m still up since last night. I’m just browsing net. So how many times have you been in hospital?
176044759,Congratulations What are the benefits of having the success?
176044760,Qt signal prolongation that many meds cause can kill too if you go into arrhythmia. It’s a reason to ask for an EKG that psychiatrists often neglect especially if you’re taking pretty bad offenders like Seroquel. Somewhere there’s a chart of Qt signal prolongation per antipsychotic.
176044761,I was wondering about a methadone clinic. I’ll call the one I know of today. It’s far from my house though (like 35 minutes).
174353269,To be honest I have the opposite problem when people are convinced that I am normal and should do normal things despite not having a normal brain.
176044762,i think you meant “police” huh… but good to hear =D
176044763,"No one understands. They all say “it’s nothing, don’t think about it, so what?, you have nothing to hide” etc."
176044764,Maybe because the brain is like a storage device. If an A.I required an SSD to store it’s consciousness we could corrupt it by damaging the memory.
176044765,"I left home at 29, and I have been independent for 4 years now. Wouldn’t have it any other way. Now I am settled, it’s great to have your own space and to do what you want when you want"
174353270,"I used to feel that way all through my twenties with bipolar. I was always serious, I had problems, and I wasn’t good enough. After five years with schizophrenia symptoms I’ve learned not to think like that anymore. My self esteem is very high, I think I just learned to let the depressing thoughts go so that the sza wouldn’t hurt so much. It’s a big load off my shoulders. Maybe try to take things in a lighter fashion and do something fun? Family Guy or some cat videos or something. You’re not in control of most stuff, but you can try to be in control of how much fun you’re having. I play a lot of games and watch a lot of funny stuff, and I love to converse with family. I’m sorry you didn’t have a good time at the Lion King, I would have been a little bit interested to see it. Maybe comedy would be better… have you ever seen _NAME_ and _PERSON_? It’s ridiculous! Just find someone who will let you watch their Hulu account"
176044766,"Basically, I will simply watch my inner state changing as it changes. I will not argue with the voice. I will not beg it to stop. Simply watch. My brain will start going crazy of course. And the voice becomes stronger. Feels like it is gaining greater control. But I will not become afraid of that fear. I will simply be aware of it, watching it. Let it do whatever it wants. Its a very intense, negative and draining experience…but I haven’t lost control of my mind or body ever since I started practicing it… It is kinda like meditation. And I discovered the method when I decided to meditate during a psychosis. And at the end, I feel amazing!"
176044767,"It’s not as much as some penis threads get and those of us that own a vagina need places to talk about our issues and fears, too."
176044768,Very true. I go out and about all the time with no problems just overcome it really and try not to analyze everything
176044769,I shouldn’t say cheap foods. Because the one i fed him and he reacts good to is only $20. Anything with corn in it is bad for him.

176044771,Life is good. Just working on going to uni at the moment.
176044772,Very good _AT_MENTION_ ! So talented!
176044773,I know it’s hard sometimes but making the tough decisions becomes a good thing for you. It’s not good to live in pain. If your struggling then maybe the hospital will help. If your not functioning you need to get some help and sounds like your not improving. If you can’t see your doctor soon then hospital or emergency will help. Maybe not for your mind now but in a while it will.
176044774,I like discussing things.
176044775,I used to do bodybuilding and powerlifting as well trying a vegetarian diet to improve health now.
176044776,"My pdoc says I’m hallucinating and delusional. We’ve tried everything and nothing makes the men stop following and recording me so I think they’re real. I just think meds don’t make everything stop. They keep me from being obsessed with religion so I take my meds always. I even have a pill reminder app so I don’t forget. And yet, I’m still being followed and recorded. My pdoc is very aware"
176044777,So basically God is making me purposefully sick because I’m not following God or not wanting Him to take control over my life.
176044778,yea i checked out her webpage… it’s pretty good art too.
176044779,"Let your psychiatrist know if its bothering you, maybe he can help. Me its not everyday so it doesn’t bother me much. I had it yesterday but not today."

176044789,"My sister did the Whole 30 thing and has mixed reviews. She said it was a very difficult diet to follow, But she did start to feel better in a couple weeks."
176044790,That’s ?????? up that your dad would say that. He’s completely in the wrong.
176044791,Originally I weighed 235 pounds a couple of years ago. You can do it _AT_MENTION_ Just have to eat less and eat lower carb.
176044792,I found that my internal monologues and thought broadcasting went away when I started supplementing zinc. You may have too much copper in that case.
176044793,I fouNd clonazepam (klonopin) works in about 15 minutes and last like 8 hours +
176044794,Hey buddy. How goes?
174353275,Definitely true. That’s why we always have to control for the placebo effect in drug trials. Unfortunately here in Australia it’s deemed unethical to deliberately offer placebo treatments. A long time ago I was involved in a study looking at placebo immunosuppression. We could teach the immune response by pairing a strange tasting drink with a drug. Then we saw the same immune response with just the drink and not the drug. Meaning less side effects. But ethical concerns were raised about this (not giving an actual drug). Don’t know what happened in the end.
176044795,I think you should petition for a home nurse to come give you the depot. They should be able to.
174353278,If you were strongly delusional you wouldn’t be talking about it in the unusual beliefs section of a forum for schizophrenia.
176044796,Yes but it can likely cause thyroid and kidney problems. 50% of those on lithium have kidney problems according to Wikipedia.
176044797,"You need to be given to for now. I use the radio a lot. And I live in a home where the provider does a lot of giving. After awhile, I started to give back."
176044798,Yup me too …
176044799,I am awful with no sleep. I sleep 10 hours at night and then a 2 hour nap during the day. So 12 hours awake and 12 hours asleep.
176044800,"I don’t really have ongoing delusional thinking. I have had two psychotic breaks, if that’s what you mean"
176044801,"No it’s not an add-on antipsychotic. They switched the people from risperidone, olanzapine etc over to lumateperone and back. But I see how it looks like that from what I posted. They were only taking one antipsychotic at a time, either the lumateperone or their regular antipsychotic."
176044802,"Yes, i think it’s a kind of severe dissociation. Nowadays i only have it slightly, but when i was young i couldn’t relate to my own legs and motions. It was very frightening, but don’t get scared (you don’t seem to be). Just try to accept it if you can, then it goes away slowly. But it is an interesting phenomenon."
176044803,ok She’s learned not to let anxiety get in the way.
176044804,2:50 am. I went to bed at 1 and woke up about 2:15. Going to try to go back to sleep. These late nights kill me

176044817,…does anybody know about deaf schizophrenics hearing voices? Saw it on the internet recently…
176044818,_AT_MENTION_ It’s possible you are having ‘delusions of persecution’. Bring this up with your doctor at your next appointment.
174353288,"Routine, schedules, productive useful habits etc. Make daily routines and follow them strictly."
176044819,"I’ve seen you tank at least twice since I’ve been on this forum. I was so worried about you once, that I sent you my phone number so we could talk. The other time you had strange delusions about your father. You have some sort of affliction in my opinion. My fear with you is that you’ll convince yourself you are well…go off your meds…and tank again. But I suppose to test the waters, you could talk to your doctor about weaning off your meds, then see where you land. I understand why you want to know if it’s side effects from your meds, or an actual diagnosed condition that you have which is causing you all of these mental issues."
176044820,Have you been on paliperidone pills?
176044821,There’s no such thing as hell. Nobody in their right mind would inflict torture on another human being for eternity. That’s a disproportionate punishment regardless of the crime.

176044829,"I got invega sustenna increase in the beginning of March. Reasons are a week and 1/2 before it was due, I’d start to relapse, cognitively, emotionally, with my moods, insight, sleeping pattern, snappiness towards people, driving my mom nuts. Lost motivation, had no goals because I was dealing with symptoms. So I got the increase and it lasted till like 3-4 days b4 it was due. I got that dose in the beginning of April again, and here I am a week before, and I can’t sleep for the life of me. Other issues. I don’t want to start dampering relationships that I do unintentionally. Hopefully it doesn’t get that bad again. My question is, does It take awhile for shot increases to work or is it just going to keep losing its effectiveness sooner and sooner each time I get it? My metabolism takes medicine and eats it up so fast…"
176044830,What happens if you can metabolise the medicine faster?
176044831,Are you on medication? If voices are getting out loud and too annoying you should admit yourself to psychiatric hospital

176044846,One of the big things on this forum is the quest for the right meds. Haldol is really old. If you still have hallucinations and paranoia it might make sense to try something else like invega. Ask around

So my mom took me to the doctor and the damn doctors assistant said in front of all the other patients in the waiting room, that I should drop my pants when entering the examination room. I was a shy kid and found this very embarrassing. Anyhow, the doctor set up a hospital appointment for an operation to drop the testicle. But me being such a shy kid, I did not want this operation. So I looked up the details as to why sometimes the testicle does not drop. From that, I figured out how to do it myself. And I did. At a later appointment, the doctor was very surprised concerning how the testicle had managed to drop just days before the operation. I, at that time, never told anyone that I did it myself. LOL"

174353305,"I’m diagnosed with schizophrenia, had it since childhood. Wondering if there’s anyone else who is like me, I don’t suffer from negative voices. My voices are actually extremely helpful and loving. I have one main voice and 4-5 other voices. They tell me their spiritual guides here to help me. I do have all the other symptoms of schizophrenia including pretty severe negative symptoms like paranoid delusions and thoughts, feeling like I can read others thoughts and feelings, my mind feels extremely expanded. But the positive symptoms manifest itself in more of a spiritual type of experience for me including my delusions and hallucinations all very spiritual but not at all negative. I’ve done research on this wondering what causes some people to have such a negative experience with voices and why my experience with the voices is so very different. I did read that people in countries that are more industrialized with more technology usually have more negative voices. I also read a research pape

176044921,"Same as me, antipsychotics got rid of my OCD symptoms, I was praying 20 consecutive times and washing my hands a lot thinking I had radioactive poison on me. I don’t have any of these now that I am taking antipsychotics."
176044922,I’m like a cat I’ve got 9 lives. I overdosed on drugs twice and nearly died. My parents weren’t home it was just my step brother. I walked in the door one night after getting high and I collapsed. The only thing I remember is waking up and my step brother was about to call 911. I told him not to I didn’t want my mom finding out. I ended up having a severe seizure. Another time I was partying all night. It was noon the next day. I didn’t feel high but I’m sure I had drugs in my system. I ran a red light and got T-Boned by someone going 50 mph. It practically ripped my car in half. I walked away without a scratch. The police report had a scale of 1-5 of how bad the accident was and they described it as a 5. Another time I was doing a drug deal in isolated area. The guy pulled a gun and tried to rob me and my stepbrother. We took off running and we ran up onto the freeway. It was pitch black and I could see the flashes of light and hear bullets whizzing by my head. My step brother jumped of
f the bridge and landed in the river. I jumped off and landed on the embankment bellow. I ran under the bridge and tripped over a rock and landed on a pile of glass. The piece of glass went almost all the way through my hand. One night I was coming home from fishing with my younger cousin who was 10 at the time. I was on the freeway going 70 and I nodded off. I came to and we were going off the road. I yanked the week to get back on the road and we started swaying from side to side uncontrollably. We ended up doing two complete 360’s on dry pavement. I corrected the steering wheel and it stopped us from going off the road. I did a lot of stupid stuff when I was young. It’s a miracle I’m not dead or in prison. I stole my step dads V-12 Jaguar XJ12 one night. I wanted to see how fast it could go. I got it up to 150 mph. The peddle was only halfway to the floor. I did 150 mph for 7 minutes. A drive that normally would take 20 minutes I did in 7. This one wasn’t so much a close call with death but more li
ke 20 years in prison. I had a butt ton of drugs in my car. It was late at light and I stopped at gas station. My step brother and I were getting smokes and zig zags. We couldn’t go inside the gas station they had a walk up window. We’re standing at the window and a cop car pulls up right behind us. My step brother leans over and tells the clerk cancel the zig zags. The guy holds them up for the cops to see. I had a kilo of drugs in my car. The blood drained out of my head and I turned white as a ghost. We turned around and the one cops says to the other want to shake them down? A call came in over radio and they just drove away. I went to a rave one night in downtown Detroit. The had raves in old abandoned warehouses. I’m coming home from the rave late at night and I’m in the worst part of Detroit and my car breaks down. My girlfriend and I had no choice but to walk. It was 2 days before Xmas. We’re walking down the road and there were carloads of gangbangers circling us. They would drive by and st
are at my girlfriend then they kept circling back. My girlfriend was crying she thought we were dead meat. A cop car came down the road and she ran up to the car waving her arms. The cops looked at us and left us for dead. 2 minutes later a cab came down the road. We jumped in the back and told the lady we had no money. She said she couldn’t live with herself if she left us so she gave us a ride to the city limit for free.

I hope you understand this. In my opinion, just try meds after meds untill one works for you and you wouldnt think about these subject, as i am now, i can ignore or not be intrigue in subject that brings paranoia.

176044937,I have a friend that did quit gaming mostly. He said it was just taking up too much of his time and he wasn’t achieving anything. So he started working out instead and is generally much happier for it. But he still comes back to games sometimes but only occasionally. I guess I would work out what you’d rather be doing with your time and try and jump into doing as much as that as possible. You won’t stop playing games if you have nothing to replace it with as an activity.

This morning when I woke up I felt way better then later got treatment 16 today. I feel lifted how I felt when I had treatment 13. So the improvements continue 0 signs of mania or psychosis right now. So I’d say for me personally it doesn’t seem like it will trigger mania but I am keeping a close watch on it as well as the pdoc.

174353313,"You know, funny you’re asking this specifically. Because a few weeks ago, I finally got the nerve to ask my husband something (who’s been with me since SZ started 15yrs ago). I asked “How often do I do or say something, and you think it’s just my schizophrenia talking?” I told him to be totally honest, because I know there have been times, like during a fight or something, that he just throws that at me to be spiteful. He said “Well, there aren’t many times I think you’re WAY out there, but there are little things that I notice sometimes and just let go.” He explained that when we were coming out of the store that day, we walked around a woman on her phone who was walking into the exit door… And at the TIME, I got pissed off when we walked by her and I heard her saying something on the phone like “people dont know where they’re going, didn’t read the sign on the door, were right in the way, blahblahblah”, and when I heard her saying that, I told him “SHE’S the one wh
o needs to learn to read, I wish she WOULD say something to ME” and I was like ready to fight this chick! He just patted me on the back and we continued to the car. Fast forward back to his statement about noticing things SZ related. He explained that what that woman had ACTUALLY said on the phone was “I don’t even know where I’m going, I’m right in everyone’s way because I can’t read door signs”. I had totally heard something different… I legitimately turned what she had actually been saying on the phone into a personal attack on me. I admit, I have a persecution complex, and since the beginning of SZ I’ve had auditory hallucinations. But hubs says this kind of thing does happen a lot… and he just smiles, or changes the subject, and he’s learned how to handle it. I have a few conspiracy theoriesI constantly think people are talking about me or judging me etc when in reality they probably didn’t even notice me lol.

I think it comes from something lacking within the person so they look for some outward “task” to complete so that they can feel satisfied or at least to distract themselves from the thing which is eating them.

Some of the things she has said has made me upset and often i cry during and after sessions. recently she questioned my worth. she suggested that if i didn’t have sex or give affection to my partner I will lose them. She even asks more questions about my partners life than my own. My therapist said that was weird. She’s so mean and I feel like she’s out to make my life worse, not better. refusing to give me my meds and making me feel like ????. She makes me freeze up with anxiety and i can never stand up for myself. I have a hard time doing that thanks to social phobia. has anyone else had shitty psychiatrists ?"

174353340,"I’d just like to remind people about that. Suffering from an episode of psychosis does not necessarily mean a person is or will be violent. Of course, if a person is psychotic it is usually best to seek treatment or help from a professional. Sometimes that means going to the hospital involuntarily. I just dislike that sometimes the average person equates the word psychotic to being somehow overly aggressive or violent. That is not always the case. Sometimes it just means losing touch with reality, being unable to differentiate between what is and what is not. It sounds slightly nicer to say, “I was suffering from an episode of psychosis.” As opposed to “I was psychotic.” Darn shame too. In the eyes of some people we’ll always be psychos. Don’t ever let yourself believe that. We are people that have a brain disease. Not weak minded, not weak willed, and while under treatment not anymore dangerous than the average person. Without medication we’re about as dangerous as people on street 
drugs. That doesn’t mean everyone is violent or dangerous. If anything statistics show that we are more likely to be a danger to ourselves than a danger to others. 1 in 10 people who suffer from schizophrenia commit suicide. This is more likely to happen during the first 10 years after initially being diagnosed. Let’s strive to lessen that. I think despite the tragic statistic, making others aware of that could lessen the _USER_ID_ and bring some much needed sympathy when the word schizophrenic is thrown around."

174353357,I think that’s not right I have 4 children And I would never ever agree with that. if I had to choose between death and schizophrenia I would choose schizophrenia. Life is sacred!
176045107,You can get through this _AT_MENTION_. This too shall pass. But maybe do something nice for yourself because you’ve had it so rough.
174353359,Doesn’t sound psychotic.

176045109,Thank you so much! It means a lot to know people are finding this site helpful.
176045110,https://www.gadgetgyani.com/top-9-chat-forums-on-deep-web/ There are already a lot of chatrooms on the dark web by the way. That’s why I mentioned your idea seems grandiose as it won’t stop wars. Plus how on Earth are we to help you when you ask for us to help you stop wars by supporting need for darkweb chatrooms. Youll likely find more supporters for that if you went on a darkweb chatrooms yourself lol

176045120,Even on meds I still have what other people would call delusions But they’re kind of in the background now. This delusion you have seems to be ruining your life. All you can do is be 100% honest with your psychiatrist and hope he puts you on a med that helps.
176045121,Great job. Looks good.
176045122,Message me! I did the same until here recently. It’s a very vicious cycle when you begin to isolate. But I am now working and trying my best to get rid of the symptoms. I would love to talk to you.

176045127,"I’ve had markedly more fun from gaming than any book. I can’t remember ???? from my gaming days though. I should have made demos of my league play and reviewed them. Lots of intricacy and subtlety I can appreciate. Books are exponentially more useful than games though. Unless you could merge the two, educational gaming. Making learning addictive. Imagine that."

176045131,Congrats. They do really help for OAB. Glad you got relief.
176045132,"well i hate to have to tell people what to do at work, or training new employees for example. i just like to be a trusted employee, where im allowed to work independently without a lot of oversight. i don’t think i will go very far in a career, because of my lack of leadership and management skills."

Even after years? Please, tell me if its possible… I guess the aps are not the best against the worries, but the pdocs doesnt know another non addictive alternative… It feels like my mind is not ‘‘open’’… I guess its just oppressed by worries, plus my thinking is screwed up… I think, but i have crazy thoughts, which doesnt help my functionality … Please tell me, that the ap is capable to calm down those worries? Maybe after some time? … Have happy holidays too!"

174353365,I started on this med two months ago while in the hospital. The only thing I’ve noticed is that toward the end of my first injection’s efficacy my symptoms increased. And I have been more hungry and have gained 4 or 5 lbs in the first two months…which may not sound like a big deal but I’ve lost 60 lb this year and want to get rid of the rest of the excess and have been working hard on that. It’s hard to be at the mercy of a drug in regard to its side effects.
176045138,You’re in denial. Every post you make is saying how you don’t have psychosis and the doctors are wrong. I know its hard to process but doctors don’t lie to patients. Its just not how medicine is. Try not to blame yourself for it.

176045142,That’s a good idea. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ .
176045143,That is a nice little video.
176045144,I got Nintendo when it basically first came out… I wanted a My Pet Monster more I remember lol. The Legend of _NAME_ shattered expectations for what the platform could bring to you. It was one of my first games after Duck Hunt and Gyromite. I lost my video game way in college but may be circling back slowly now! But I loved _NAME_.

Forgive me, but I think what I’ve come to understand: is that he is up there in age and thusshould have/definitely deserves - to have at by this juncture. Maybe my specificity on this is off putting to some ears but I have no friends, and this site has a lot of meaning to me. Also I have a hyperbolic or parabolic risk tolerance, coupled with total devastating loneliness. : )"
176045147,Gotcha friend! Bring on the cats!
176045148,Eating breakfast and dreading going to work. We have a pt there currently who is SO high maintenance. Extremely psychotic and anxious and demands constant attention. Yesterday he made things so difficult. I don’t want to blame him for his illness but he threw a whole fit yesterday acting like he couldn’t breathe and fake falling over and making up all these symptoms so he could be taken to the hospital because he didn’t want to wait to see our doctor to get a corona test. He even admitted it was all an act when he came back. (And he does not have corona) That is not ok. (And he did all that when a different patient was having a real crisis!! So he took attention away from that!) Every morning he acts like that about something.
176045149,_AT_MENTION_. I’m glad you’re gonna work on it

176045156,"_AT_MENTION_ did you do all that stuff because you also wanted to, or only because you wanted to get out of the darkness? Sometimes, especially re mental states, doing something becuase we enjoy doing it, takes us out of ourselves. If, on the other hand, we do something but focus mostly on our goal at the end, we tend not to notice the Now. I enjoy art so I use art on the computer as a way of dealing with depression and monotony. It usually works, especially when I create something I like. Of course, some days even that doesn’t work but, hey, nothing’s perfect!"

176045161,_NAME_ suggests to have a reading of the wills. Get together and have your mom say what everyone is getting so there is no issues with everyone in the room? Wills are tricky and the thing is a lot of people that make them a lot of times don’t want to do it because it’s such a depressing thought. maybe tell your mom if she could do that because it worries you?
176045162,just drink even if you dont feel like it. challenge the feeling.
176045163,"Just a few days ago, I was gaming on a phone playing a game meant for a console with a controller. You’d be facing your reflection and the reflection would do one of four actions, raise left arm, raise right arm, laugh, or act surprised. You’d have four buttons and each button was a different one of those actions, and you’d have to mimic what you saw. It started out slow but by the time it neared the end you’d have to react in half a second. This was never any problem when I played this game with a controller, but on a phone there were four virtual buttons on the screen and half the time you pressed them they just didn’t register the input. I sat there for one and a half hours doing this, each try taking about 1 minute. It was infuriating because I’d get to the last one or two mimics and the buttons just wouldn’t recognize my input. I was so angry at the game. When I finally got past it I was so relieved. The game is Crono Trigger, it’s an event at the beginning of the game called t

176045174,"Gaslighting is an abuse tactic where an abuser does something bad to a person, then pretends it never happened and says the person is crazy and making up stories. It is a way abusers get away with mistreating the people in their care, particularly children and disabled adults. If this has happened to you, it is okay to talk about here. It is not a community-wide conspiracy to torment a person into believing they are insane. Anyone who believes this has been done to them is, in fact, delusional. It is okay to seek help overcoming this delusion on here. It is not okay to try and convince others your delusion is real."

It’s not confirmed that I have it because Oregon isn’t really testing anyone unless there’s overwhelming reason to so my doctor told me to just stay home. But sore throat can definitely be a symptom. But my doctor said everyone gets a fever, so if there’s other symptoms but no fever, it’s probably something else."
176045182,I’m sorry u feel like that wen shopping. I used to live in a atmosphere like that where I felt everyone hated me. I hope u get a pdoc eventually who can help get rid of such extreme paranoia. I still kind of get it too
