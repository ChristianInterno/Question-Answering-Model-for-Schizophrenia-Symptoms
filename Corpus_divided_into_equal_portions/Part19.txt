I cant remember it being this bad before i took APs. Could they change my mind for the worse. I feel trapped !!!

174366288,"I still have the time travel delusion going on a lot. Like I have a lot of insight. It’s like my mind is the machine in a way. Reincarnation. In a sad way, I’m always schizophrenic. I prefer the term and condition of time loop(s) as opposed to causal loop. The internet and Wikipedia do help me out a lot. I figure we live in a simulation and that consciousness can be stolen, borrowed, and people can be turned into p-zombies, which is probably offensive to some folks but is also important to the fields of psychology and psychiatrist and philosophy. It all boils downs to physics. I hate school and don’t want to ever work again or go back due to ‘giving up on humanity and myself’ being discouraged, depressed, angry, and having probably ptsd or remnants of acute stress disorder and reliving the same time periods over and over again in my head for the rest of my life… I feel I have a lot to contribute and could win a Nobel Prize some day if I had the intelligence and education to do mathemati
cs and physics. Not something I really want to do or aspire towards though. I don’t like people for the time being. Why help them after what they did to me? But it ain’t going to happen. Why sweat it and fantasize about it. Plus, I hate crowds and ceremonies and speeches. I think it’s literally all in my head. Sort of like the Netflix show ‘Travelers’ or the science behind the show. My mind was uploaded to a computer by an unknown group or beings (probably greys or reptilians) in unknown time and sent back in time and is now occupying my current time period body and my brain as a disabled person (opposite affliction to _PERSON_ in the show lol). She became undisabled afterwards. I became disabled afterwards. Weird. I was normal before that. Had no clue of anything. I even have thought about stuff like Reptilian consciousness or alien consciousness and that’s why my DP/DR and vision and senses were messed up and I lost IQ points and have mental illness but then I realize that’s probably not that 
damn case! AI probably is involved. My mind or soul or consciousness is probably from the far future past or near 2036. It’s 2020 now so I’m from 16 years in the future now via a soul transfer thing in time. I sound bizarrely and acutely sick but I can look and act normal for someone with mild or moderate ‘disorganized’ schizophrenia from what I can gather. I believe the mild Asperger’s Syndrome helps me through the disease and chaos in my head. In every life I struggle with family, mental health, body weight, body image, diet, MONEY, and living situations. I can never work and rarely go to school/college. In this life, I don’t want to. In my past lives, I had college degrees, but since I’m in a different time period or universe, I have to start all over again with no evidence or degrees and little to no memory and probably no knowledge retained. The farthest in time I have been is 3000 AD according to my memories which is in line with the TV show as well as the technology. I get slow memory rec
all over the years like slippage or leakage. We’re talking about infinity here or a infinite amount of past universes and planet earths. I cannot remember most things about my past lives, but it has given me insight into physics."

I’m coming to terms with the reality that I will probably have symptoms for life, And I’m unsure how I feel about trying clozapine. Maybe I can live with this. I’ve been reading some _NAME_ books lately, but about to start with a book called “hidden valley road” a story about 6 brothers with psychotic illness. Should be a fun read. Still play my games, still have music on almost constantly. Still try to do my best to keep the house clean, laundry done, etc. It’s a quiet life. Simple. But it’s mine, for better or worse.

174366304,"I remember how I hated having neighbors when I lived in a apartment in Sweden. They probably hated having me as a neighbor too as I screamed at the voices every day and listened to music at all hours etc Money can help give more peace of mind I agree. To not have to worry about paying rent, Internet, or having noisy disturbing neighbors etc I rather live in a house. Best home I ever had was with my x n the girls. It’s the only place I felt at home n it was a house out in the country. I was sleeping in my car for three weeks but that was because I was paranoid etc I had a apartment. It seems lots of people get schizophrenia when they are at university or high school? So as you guys say they are not able to get a highly paid job perhaps. I’m thankful to be on disability pension and get help from family to get cheaper rent. I couldn’t afford to pay full rent anywhere and my sacred neighs agistment I don’t think and I rather keep her of course as she’s the platonic love of my life. My mum doe

She thinks it is embarrassing ugly diagnosis and my family want it to not be spoken of I think or not to tell people about it. I met a woman who was a designer and shop boutique owner and was rich but then she had psychotic episode and lost all her friends.she said they only loved her when she was in her boutique but when she couldn’t work anymore they were nolonger her friends.they only wanted her clothes and fanciness of her that she was considered cool to know.that changed quickly."

176095518,I haven’t made it in a while but it’s basically you need about a tsp of yeast and sugar. In a large bowl combine your yeast and sugar then add warm water ( I think a cup or so). Let that sit for about 15-30 minutes until your water “bubbles”. Then you add your flour to the water and mix until you form a dough. Knead for about 5 minutes. Then form a ball with your dough and cover your dough with cooking oil. Put back into bowl and cover. Let rise for about 2 hours (until it’s double). Then punch your dough down. Grease 2 bread pans. Next cut your dough in half and put your dough into the two pans. Let rise about 2 hours. Then bake. You’ll want to google a basic bread recipe but what I’ve told you is basically how it’s done. Anytime I try a new recipe I only make half in case it doesn’t turn out. That happens too. I made irish soda bread today. It was super easy and it turned out fine.

She wanted to know if I was depressed. I really had a hard time focusing on the conversation. I felt really out of it. And now I feel so drained and lethargic. Maybe it is depression or maybe it’s part of the Depakote withdrawal process? Either way I feel like a sloth and have hardly any energy to type this post on my phone.
176095539,Oh really. Do you know of any examples?
176095540,thanks. I have got voices back to normal thought without the “filtering” and it is the weirdest thing ever. its like for me at least hearing something very distorted by a filtering and the filtering in my experience always seems to be a belief about ourself maybe that we are not good enough or something like that generally a put down. the other problem I ran into is getting the energy to downcycle. the energy seems to keep the voices cycling. so I worked out sending the fear they were giving me to my stomach as nervousness rather than back to the “voice” which was making it worse. and also not being scared of them anymore and whatever idea they represent but not fighting them either. not giving any reality to them seems best. they are in my experience just a confused part of our mind we somehow told to think it was someone else. an obvious example in my opinion would be “pr@ying” for example. what is a pr@yer going to do but tell your mind its someone else and to be someone else if that 
makes sense. also getting any trauma out that is keeping them that way was very helpful for me. cry as much as you can in my opinion. if can ever get to a point where there are no more repressed sadness that would most likely help. I also try to cry out the pain that was beneath the voice if that makes sense or supporting it. helped a lot.
176095541,I’ve been overweight before. The first time was in my early 20’s during dissociative episode. My mom showed me a picture in my late 20’s of me sitting holding my baby niece and I was so fat it was scary. I had no memory of being that fat. Then in my 30’s I gained weight on medication. I was up to 280 lbs or something. I weighed 175 in my mid 20’s. I’m happy now with where I am I have some weight but I feel like I don’t need to lose much.

176095572,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ for sharing my excitement. I don’t know the exact date yet but when I do I will definitely be doing the countdown. Good idea. I love countdowns.
176095573,I play video games
176095574,My most favourite machines in the entire gym. I love it.
176095575,"Sorry to hear about your friend’s passing, _AT_MENTION_. You’re right-- SZ doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon, but there’s steps we can all take to feel better."
176095576,My mother was a lonely housewife for years and it had an affect on me. I didn’t want to marry and be like that. But I became withdrawn by copying her and now stay in my room alone most of the time. I’m only vaguely aware that the problem is loneliness.
176095577,"I’ve been a caregiver for _NAME_, physical reasons. To me it seems more important."
176095578,What dose were you on when you relapsed ?
176095579,I have my faith and that’s that.
176095580,"When I got divorced there was no fighting, no arguing, no name calling, no blaming. Yes I hurt my husband but in time he was ok and we remain the best of friends. I have a hard time understanding divorces where they tear each other down, beat each other up, fight over property and custody and threaten each other, call the cops and get restraining orders. It’s tragic."
176095581,_AT_MENTION_ you can do whatever you like. I think however that what laetitia wrote is much much worse and more triggering than what I wrote. And you don’t threaten her.
176095582,"When I was in the state hospital, we referred to the “outside world” and how we were afraid of it. But I felt no sense of security being in the hospital. I got out as soon as I could. I just wanted to be home."
176095583,"Well…you definitly don’t need more meds, maybe different meds, but if you already tried everything available that you believe in and nothing was better than your current situation then I would shift my attention to your diet. Agree with pr21, you might be low on iodine which is correlated to energy. Anyways, if you aren’t already I would recommend eating 2 eggs each day. Eggs are packed with nutrition that are good for energy. You could try it for a couple of weeks and see if it does something for you."
176095584,_AT_MENTION_ Did you ask her where she put them?
176095585,I have a fat liver.

Even if you do stop it to drink, you have to wait at least a month for it to rid your system and avoid withdrawal. It takes about 4 days to leave, but the withdrawal kinda lingers around for a while."
176095588,"Yes, I have found a med combo that works for me. It might need adjustment but it does help definitely. If I didn’t take them I’d be in hospital"

176095594,"I wasn’t referring to you specifically but that is the same thing as getting rid of a large portion of a belief system. Its the equivalent of saying you can have religion without believing in God or angels. Ok but I do, so I can’t just change that. I can’t just stop believing in something. If you could do that, good for you but for me and many others it is challenging or impossible to just eliminate such beliefs."
176095595,I had forgotten about my gaming addictions. Could you get a job/work more hours?
174366327,I was stable on 20mg Abilify. Zyprexa 15-20mg+Seroquel didn’t work my pdr said. I wanted Zyprexa bcz no prolactin but my pdr refused saying I wasn’t stable on it. Now stable on 4mg Risperdal.

I didn’t do a good job of showing how . EF was mentioned at my post dx appointment. . Luckily I have my stepdaughter or one of the granddaughters to take me shopping.

176095596,"How could I be more authentic in regards to my unusual beliefs? If the world isn’t even real, just me and the devil having a chat around a fire in the desert, why bother? Everything is just a hallucination, but I do feel moral obligations towards other projections of myself."

176095601,yeah medication is not always effective.

176095617,I vote for this too.

174366339,"I think there’s a difference between someone who says you don’t have schizophrenia due to your being less impaired , and someone like me who would say you are more fortunate than many/most with the diagnosis . Some of us, by the way environmental and genetic factors combine, are dealt a better hand than others. I think as well as accepting schizophrenia is a spectrum disorder, we should acknowledge that because of that some are less fortunate/need more help and support than others."
176095620,I missed my afternoon dose of Depakote today. This could possibly set me back a bit. Hopefully I won’t start to cycle. I was away at my Fathers doctor and when I got home I forgot to take it. This rarely happens! Oh well.

Some of it i dont genuinly recall either. And i dont think they would fully understand. (Sorry _NAME_, _NAME_ and _NAME_) :("
176095628,I don’t work. Haven’t for years. On disability pension since 2004. I do volunteering at my cricket club in the city. Less stress works for me so I do a couple of half days a week.

174366336,"Everyone has different opinions and beliefs. I solely believe in the Bible, whether it’s part of my programming or not. I still struggle with understanding how I escaped the simulation and helped run it besides “aliens”. “Why me?” comes to mind mind a lot. There’s fact and reality and then there is superstition. When I escaped and the “aliens” told me Christianity is true inside the simulation (brain in a vat) and outside the simulation it’s false. It really screwed with me and still does. I don’t know why they chose me or what makes me so special. I believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible, mainly out of fear of being tortured again. I believe magic powers exist and ordinary people can become special and have gifts or be embuede with prophecy. But I only believe in prophets from the old and new testament. I just feel like I’m in a time loop and reality repeats a lot. I can prove it, but I’m worried that my predictions are too much for some people. I feel like talk
ing though. Perhaps a little today. I just don’t understand why reality has to be this way. It’s cruel. I remember being in another world or reality before 2011ish. Stranger Things would call this the ‘Upside Down’ or some crap lol. I also experienced tremendous consciousness transfer, time travel, etc. I guess nobody believes me. I cannot make any money which sucks, and I think I was given or infected with schizophrenia deliberately. I don’t know how I could have been infected unless it was destiny or fate since I sincerely and strongly believe it’s caused by the Norovirus when I was a child (In my case. I cannot speak for everyone). If I’m wrong, nobody will take me serious, won’t notice, won’t care, and continue their lives and I will continue my living under the ‘title’ schizophrenic. If I’m right, there’s a potential I will be viewed as a time traveler and perhaps make millions off generous donations lol. I do see the future all the time. I just fear for my life. If viewed as a 
time traveler (a real one) my safety might be put in danger."

The body cannot be in this state chronically. So it’s not just “in your head.”"

176095686,"hey _AT_MENTION_-Faz, i’m a fairly high functioning sza and i experience what you describe when i have insomnia. I’ve had conversations with others in my head (mostly distant friends) and sometimes they’re very pleasant, my last few chats others have sent me a song (which were relevant and made sense). I haven’t really had the opportunity to fact check the telepathy but it can get unpleasant at times which I assume is why you would like it to stop. I’ll just say that I believe that this is a real phenomenon, others here will scoff at the reference. Focus on getting more rest, your brain is working too much if your having conversations with others in your head. Try to avoid caffeine, sugar, any stimulant-- these tend to race the mind."

After a long weaning off process, I started 5-HTP and within three months felt more like myself than I’ve felt in 10 years. 5-HTP is a precursor of Serotonin, so it can cross the blood-brain barrier.

174366361,The best thing that I can advise you to do is to speak to your psychiatrist and make it clear to them that you’re living in fear everyday because of paranoia. You may have to consider Clozapine. It’s a wonder medicine for a lot of people.

174366355,"_NAME_. I have schizophrenia too. We may not have the exact same symptoms, but I understand what you’re going through. The issue here is that you want me to tell you that you’re right, that you should just sit around and wait because the meds will miraculously kick in after 3 years. I’m not going to tell you that, because that’s just not how it works. It’s been 2 years, _NAME_. The meds have done all that they’re going to do. Yeah it sucks, but that’s the reality of your situation. You keep saying that you feel normal for an hour or so each day, and that’s lovely, but if you only do things when you feel normal, then you’re not going to get anywhere, because doing things when you feel normal doesn’t require any effort. It’s when you’re feeling bad, but not incapacitated, that you have to fight. Obviously, I’m not suggesting that you need to go to the supermarket while you’re hallucinating that you’re being attacked by a swarm of bees, but if you’re feeling really tire
d because you’re depressed, then try to push yourself to go sit outside and get some sun. Hold out hope that someday, they will release a medication that significantly reduces your symptoms, but until then, you’ve got to make the most of what you have if you want any shot at following your dreams. You can do this, _NAME_. I know you can. I believe in you, but that’s not enough. You’ve got to believe in you too. And trust me when I say that some level of stability, even if it’s not perfect, is most certainly worth fighting for."

The current study investigates whether clinical insight at baseline moderates the effects on metacognitive capacity of 40 sessions of Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy (MERIT) among 35 participants with psychosis. Findings showed that clinical insight did not predict drop-out from therapy. Multilevel analyses provided support for our hypotheses that insight at baseline significantly moderates metacognitive gains at both post-measurement and follow-up. Our findings demonstrate that l
acking clinical insight substantially hampers the effect of this psychosocial intervention. We posit that research efforts should shift from developing interventions which enhance clinical insight, to interventions which are effective in absence of clinical insight."

There are people who are in a similar boat to you being paralyzed from the waist down or neck down. There are people born without any hands and feet but they still fight on. I read that you are in Korea, but you were in Canada before. Asian countries are by far more discriminating towards disabled people. Canada is such a nice accommodating place, perhaps you should consider coming back. You dying is only going to cause you dying. None of this suicidal feelings or acts will make people feel responsible for your death. At the most, your family will feel sad for a while and move on. It won’t achieve anything."

I cant figure out what upsets me about it. My psychosis is a lot better now i kind of go in and out of it but hearing voices nearly all day. Ive been eating pure packaged food mostly junk food because for a week i didnt eat anything. So i figured packaged easy to grad and not poisoned food was best. I decided today to try to clean two utensils so i could make a healthier sandwhich. I did it but it was upsetting. Then when i was making the sandwhich i got extremely overwhelmed and started flapping my hands and crying. Id settle down and go back to it and it would build up again. I made it through because i didnt want to waste the food. But this happens everytime i wash a dish or make food or get a drink beyond grab and go. Im lost? Idk what to do

174366392,"A little background: My parents divorced when I was four. I grew up with my mom and sister and lived very far from my dad. We talked a lot and we saw each other a few times a year, but we never spent more than two weeks at a time together while I was growing up. Both my mom and dad remarried. When I was seventeen I started having symptoms of schizophrenia. They were the worst, most difficult years of my life. My mom and stepdad were AMAZING. My mom was my champion, driving me to every appointment an hour away, my stepdad was always checking in with me about how I was. My dad talked to me semi regularly but I never saw him in person, my stepmom never spoke to me during these two years (note they were going through their own struggles at this time). After I graduated high school, I was really struggling so I decided to temporarily move to my dad’s who’s near a city, and I ended up living there for a little over 5 years, I only moved out at the beginning this year. In a nutshell, here are a few si
tuations I experienced when living there: I was told by my stepmom “You are a ??????? liar your mom’s a ??????? liar too so you come by it honestly.” When I was upset about my stepmom never talking to me during those two years and not getting the struggle I went through I was told “Well where were you when my dad died?” (This was happening during the two year period of psychosis, I later attended the funeral, my sister didn’t) When I tried to tell my dad in extreme confidence that I struggled with my relationship with my stepmom, months later in an argument she yelled at me “You are the queen of triangulation and can’t even come to me honestly with your damn issues.” I got my dad a birthday gift which he yelled at me for and told me to return to the store because it was “a ridiculous and bad idea.” I got hit on the head randomly by a stranger on public transit and got a mild concussion. I told dad I was going to urgent care with my friend I was with at the time. After a long afternoon of 
being there and figuring it out, I got home and was yelled at for being “A horrible person” because “I was inconsiderate” to not also inform my stepmom and she “was sure I had told everyone else in the world except her.” When I did finally tell them in October of last year I was planning on moving out with my boyfriend of a few years (thoroughly planned decision), my life was miserable through December. I was constantly told I was shady and dishonest with them.I was stabbing them in the back and I was taking advantage of them. I was told I was “rushing into this” and “it couldn’t possibly work out.” Hurtful things were also said about my boyfriend and our relationship. The only one of these I’ve gotten an apology for was from my dad months after the final one, and this is far from a comprehensive list of things. He recently apologized after seeing how well I’ve been doing. My psychiatrist told me this was emotional abuse, my therapist agreed. I guess I never thought about it that way 
and I’m wondering people’s thoughts. I struggle with loving my dad but recognizing that he’s a very hard person sometimes and SUPER controlling. However, I’m also 25 years old and I am hurt that he doesn’t trust me and still thinks it is ok to say things like the above (and many, many more) without any consequence. I also get mad at myself because I’m an adult and I can handle myself. Everything that has come up for me while living at my dad’s and after I’ve handled myself. I don’t understand why I care but I’ve also tried to tell him how much these things impacted me and they tell me I’m fragile. When I get angry or tell them they are disrespecting my boundaries, they laugh at me. Literally, I’ve been laughed at many times for saying this. Does anyone else have this? What can I do? I want to have a good relationship with them but I have a lot of resentment I’ve never been able to be honest about. How can I tell them this entire pattern is not ok? I’m just not sure. Sorry for such

176095903,"Hi, _AT_MENTION_ I deleted my response in the other thread because I would basically be repeating myself. You’re right, it is all about lifestyle changes. I think one of the biggest reasons people fail “diets” is because they view them as temporary. Anecdotally I believe that is why I failed many times. I always went in with this naive attitude I wouldn’t admit to myself that if I get fit then I can enjoy endless fast food and DQ blizzards. I viewed dieting as a means to an end, and I realize that was wrong. I’m tackling my addiction to food and coming to terms that I would rather be healthy and eat clean than tired and eat whatever I want. I’ve noticed in the last two weeks of just cutting out most processed foods that I have gotten better with my depression, sleep, bathroom habits, and over all cognitive functioning. I’m actually enjoying my eating habits more due to feeling better. The food also tastes great, just in a different way. I’ve lost a few pounds, and it doesn’t reall
y bother me because my focus is also on being healthy. If weight loss happens as a result then that’s great, but I’m viewing it as a bonus instead of making it my main goal. Its an awesome goal to start by making one nutritious meal a day! That is a huge first step and lays the foundation for success."

But like with me I have symptoms and I do struggle. sometimes its very hard. But overall I find I can manage and function. It wasn’t always like that for me though. Looking back there were times I was completely out of my gourd. I was not functioning or coping at all. But through time and my situation improving I eventually got to where I am now. But I’m still schizophrenic. I do the best I can to live with this condition. Just because I’m unmedicated doesn’t mean I’m not schiz.

174366419,"I have schizoaffective (bipolar type) and I was recently hospitalized and put on Vraylar 3 mg. It seems to be working somewhat, but I still have been having episodes, though more mild for the most part except when I don’t get enough sleep, which happens a lot. The lack of sleep doesn’t seem to bother me. I go to bed very late and naturally wake up very early and have energy all day, and an increase of energy at night which is why I stay up so late. I even take sleeping pills, and that’s how I’m able to sleep at all, but I still wake up a few hours later and can’t fall back asleep. I never run out of fuel or get tired, which is good because I’m doing college and have a lot of work to do, but it seems to exacerbate the paranoia and delusions if I don’t get at least 8 hours of sleep a night. I’d never heard of Vraylar before so I assume it’s a relatively new drug. They told me it should help with the delusions/paranoia and also with the mania/depression. So I was wondering if this dr
ug even helps most people. I feel like it’s a placebo, but I do have this thing where I think every medication I take is a placebo and I’m unknowingly in an experiment. I’ve tried haldol, seroquel, abilify, zyprexa, geodon, none of them worked for me, some just made me sleep all the time, some did nothing, and one made me more psychotic. Risperdal is the only one I’ve tried that has worked, and initially it made me manic, but eventually it made me tired all the time and not care about anything, plus it made me very hungry (like the munchies! god) so I gained weight despite exercising often, so I stopped taking it for several months, that’s why I ended up back in the hospital, and they decided to give me Vraylar instead of Risperdal, I assume that’s because doctors are paid to prescribe the newer medications over the older ones. Or maybe they’ve found it works better? But anyway I’m ranting, my point was, does anyone take Vraylar and find it works for them? I’m still having delusions occasion
ally when something triggers them, and it’s very common for me to get paranoid, and I even heard voices today despite taking my meds last night. I’m just wondering if this drug even works for most people, if I need to give it more time (I’ve only been on it for about a week), if I need to have a higher dose, or if I should just go back on Risperdal and maybe also an antidepressant to help with the blahs. One thing I do like about Vraylar is that it doesn’t make me tired and unmotivated like most antipsychotics, but maybe that’s because it’s just not working. I just want to find something that makes me not have to live in fear constantly, but also lets me be productive and live my life. Adderall/Vyvanse in small doses actually helps immensely with the paranoia (I do have ADHD as well) but because I have schizoaffective, the doctors don’t understand that it’s possible for it to help. They say it causes paranoia, but for me, it makes me think more logically and be able to reason through paranoia 
and delusions and realize they aren’t true. But no psychiatrist will accept that it’s possible for a stimulant to help someone like me. But yeah, Vraylar- does it work?"

174366435,"Hello, ive been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for 2 years now. I got thrown into the slammer on Thursday, finally got my smokes and phone back today. The reason it took so long for me to get privileges back was because there is no doctors on call during this weekend. I was forced to come and get the injection aswell. 25mg of risperidone and i take 2mg pill every night. It was a boring 5 days with no phone or smokes to occupy my time. So i spent most of it reading the novel i brought with me (The Paper Menagerie by _PERSON_), the third day my parents bought me a pack of cards, so i spent alot of it playing solitaire and 13 solo games mostly. The people i met were the most interesting, especially since my social skills are fairly rusty. But the nurses really wanted me to socialize instead of sitting in my room all day playing solitaire and reading. So i rolled my eyes and went to socialize with the other patients and also joined in on some group stuff. I should say, this place is abit overkil
l for my diagnosis since im fine on such a low dose. Sadly , the doctors may increase the dosage even though ive been a good patient, feels pretty unfair but whatever."

174366441,"None. Some antipsychotics improve some cognitive areas while others do not. So it depends which antipsychotic you are taking. Once you first get psychosis or sz, your brain is pretty much disorganized, so some antipsychotic might improve intellectual areas to like 50-70% while others such as classical antipsychotic may have trivial improvements in intellectual areas. So its not antipsychotic which is to blame, its matter of chossing which antipsychotic will improve your symptoms. But your results may vary. Some antipsychotic help some people and some do not. My intellectual performance is messed up on benzos and EPS meds like trihexyphenidyl and benztropine. But my intellectual performance was much improved on risperidone + clozapine Here’s one study which compares three antipsychotics effect on cognition - clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine. http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/2/233.full.pdf"

174366450,"I do not know that I have schizophrenia or not, for example, only persistent delusional disorder or schizotypal disorder (in USA known as “schizotypal personality disorder”). Coincidences are the phenomenon which has clear onset time, unlike much fewer other ideas of reference or suspiciousness. I had diagnosis of schizophrenia for some weeks above 3 years earlier. I may function significantly poorer than many schizophrenics who have hallucinations or true delusions, but it may be due to OCD (which is persistent despite medications) and aucorigia (my neologism for autism and similar conditions coined from words “autocontrast” and “originality”, condition that is developmental and is associated with social inadequacy and peculiarity). I have pervasive developmental disorder which makes me odd since childhood. Coincidences are really pleasant things for me. I think that I found male lineage of biblical _NAME_ called Israel . I would say that there is 90% chance that haplogroup J-Z18271 (s
ometimes named J-Y3088) is the lineage of Israelites, including _NAME_ and _NAME_ who lived in II millennium BC. Another possibility is that Israelites were from one of subclades of haplogroup J-FGC8712 (also called J-Y6074) - it is very probable that it was the haplogroup of _NAME_, who is one of the most influential people in history of humanity. There is something interesting in numbers occurring in names of these two haplogroups (18271 and 8712) - they are built by the same digits (1, 2, 7, 8) and have the same products of digits (1x2x8x7x1 = 8x7x1x2 = 112 = 28x4). 28 and 4 are numbers meaning day in month and month in year of the date of my first diagnosis of F84.5, F42.2, F21 at the same time - 28.4.2015. There are billions of believers in Abrahamic faiths in the world, but it looks that (almost) none of them noticed that genetic research (tests of haplogroup) may give proof of the existence of people mentioned in books like Bible and Quran."
176096045,Do you have any existential issues? That can be problem if you think about it too much
174366447,"So my husband is my very best friend, I do not even want to think about ending our relationship, but he seems to…quite often. He is bipolar as well and goes back and forth between “ I don’t want to lose you either” and “ I’m stuck with you because we have kids together, but you don’t make me happy and I want you to move out.” Honestly, I don’t think anyone really ever makes another person happy. I mean, you can do things that encourage feelings of happiness but i don’t think one person can make another person feel happy all the time, and this overwhelming feeling of walking on eggshells trying to make him feel like he is respected and happy is just …frustrating and exhausting as heck. No he is not on any medication, and honestly, I don’t want him to take any because it messes with him and makes him not himself So I don’t encourage him to take any. If you want to call me an enabler, fine, but he only has one life to live the medication was not making him happy or bettering 
his life, it just made him groggy and forgetful and gave him horrible muscle spasms and overactive leg pain, so no I refuse to push him onto any medications. He says he feels better without it and I trust him to be the judge of his own body and mind. Unfortunately, he is also paranoid and seems to need a scapegoat. And I think this is our biggest issue. Example being when I had a former friend who was roomating with us, he was constantly annoyed with her but much more patient with me. After she moved out, he started getting frustrated with his oldest son, my step son, who I had to intervene on the behalf of, and has now stopped talking to either of us for the most part. When he worked, he was constant,y angry with his employer, when he spent time with our land lord or neighbor, they annoyed him after a short time, but always during these periods when he had another target for his anger he was kinder to me, which I’ve started seeing as a pattern. I’ve even noticed, having not been there, but listening and 
taking not, that with his former girlfriend s he describes them as cheating and breaking up on him when he was between jobs, and I’m wondering if that was partially because like myself, they suddenly found themselves targets of his frustrations,but did not love him the way I door were not equipped. To handle his issues and thus broke if the relationship. Not that this in any way excuses how they did it in my book, because to me there there is no higher sign of disrespect than cheating and when you’re done with someone you need to just tell them, truthfully. I have never cheated or even looked at another man or woman in the decade we have been together and admittedly, this is my first true relationship and I have put everything into it, but because of his past he is constantly checking my iPad, my phone, my receipts, looking for signs of infidelity or lies and I just need some advice as to how to get through this and be a better wife and friend to him."

At least she was honest with me and hubby, she said she can’t believe with how many interactions there are against so many common drugs that it was ever okayed.

176096183,"Hmm, I’ve had a lot of jobs in the past 24 years I have been working. ????, I’ve had probably over 20 jobs. As far as which was most difficult for me, it probably was being an inpatient pharmacy tech at a hospital in 2017. Ugh, that was awful. They were always complaining that I was moving too slowly, even though I moved as fast as I could, not to mention standing and rapid walking on hard tile floors for 8 hrs was hell on my back. I hung in there for nearly three months, I think. I quit just days after the pharmacy manager asked me to resign my position. The job I worked after that, which was the foundry job, was also hard on my back, being stooped over molds and stuff all day, not to mention the occasional heavy lifting. That and I could’ve lost a finger when I cut myself with a circular saw a week into working there. It was my first time using a circular saw, and I didn’t know quite what I was doing. The 7-eleven was awful, too, worked there for years, but yeah, I could go on and on with

My mother in law is falling apart and my husband isn’t ready to put her in a home, I’m responsible for all her health stuff and it’s overwhelming. Its just that I’m not sure which one is the problem. Would you talk to your doctor about a med adjustment or blame it on the environmental aspect?"

I was going to sleep with the light on because I was scared they’d hurt me. Some of them left I think two or three of the stayed and eventually I turned the light off because I didn’t want my mom to say anything or ask questions. I don’t think I fell asleep till past 5am. I remember thinking last night after watching a suicide prevention video that I didn’t want to put my mom through the pain of holding my lifeless body screaming to wake me up. I’m not currently suicidal by the way this was just a thought I had based off the video. I was going to leave my house without anything and just walk until I couldn’t anymore. Then I thought well I can’t let my mom see me like this I’ll take the bus or Lyft/Uber to the hospital. I told myself I’d Uber it was cheaper and it was more likely they’d le

176096209,"I guess my big question is, what do you want to do with your degree? Do you wish to open your own practice, or work for a clinic treating patients, or work in a research setting, etc? Hoping to help your relatives is unrealistic, because in most states it’s against the law to treat family members. If you wish to be an animal psychologist, I don’t know what credentials that requires, but maybe an ABA certification might help more than a psychology masters. If you wish to treat patients in a clinical or private practice setting, you really only need to get a masters in social work, and then do some clinical hours to become an LCSW. It’s cheaper and easier, and they may have an easier time getting you into a masters program. Many schools offer a special masters program, for people who got their undergrad in an unrelated field. It’s usually an extra semester or two of just the undergrad classes you need, and then straight into the masters classes. What was your GPA in undergrad? You’ll need a
t least a 3.0 to get into most masters programs, as well as a decent score on the GRE. If you don’t have a 3.0 I recommend speaking to an advisor at the school you wish to apply to, to find out what undergrad classes you need, and then taking them one a a time at a community college to boost your GPA."

No one treated me badly. If anything, a lot of people supported me and I even got to meet with Senior Vice Presidents who are directly under the CEO at my bank.

176096249,"No, Laetitia, you are not a burden. I know sometimes we feel that way, sometimes some of us have even been called a burden by people we care about and that’s when it hurts the most. For some strange reason as people we are able to recall the worse things that have happened in our lives so easily. With that in mind, I instead invite you to think not of the positive times you’ve had, but instead try to think of the times you’ve helped another person. Anytime you have helped someone. Even if it was a stranger who showed gratitude for however you may have helped. Whether it was online or in person. It doesn’t matter if it was a something really important or a small gesture. Just think of all the times you have helped someone. Now, I know we rarely think about those things and for some strange reason it is in most of our natures to do it out of kindness than for convenience. Maybe that’s why we all have a mental illness heh. (Okay bad joke, and maybe not a good time to try that joke) anyway, a
fter you do think about that. You’ll find that among some of those you have, there will be people who care about you, not only that, sometimes, those acts of kindness, they really make a difference in a person’s life. Rarely do we think of why we’ve helped others and worse, we quickly forget the times people have been kind to us, but in the end, if you try it, you’ll realize… You are not trash.

Before my illness, I hardly thought about doing drugs, mainly because of my religious beliefs. But after I started abilify, that all changed. Suddenly I was very eager to use mind-altering drugs. I was very impulsive on abilify, and that still hasn’t changed much even after discontinuing it. Luckily I never did it, but I was very close on multiple occasions. I guess I did overdose on Hydroxyzine, but that was more because of depression. I hope to keep it up and not to do drugs."

I personally think neither are bad if they are natural (e.g. unprocessed meat, veggies, fruits, etc). But i was living a life with lots of fastfood, processed food, refined sugar, caffein, coca cola, etc. I clearly was addicted to sugar and it gave me issues. Now im not really avoiding either fats or carbs…i just started to eat real food, regularly, with no added unnecessary nonsense, among which added sugar. I also have problems with my gut and a medical specialist told me to avoid certain products (gluten, etc) and see what would happen. So i also skip bread etc for now. For me it works wonders…I immediately felt bad, with gut issues, when i ate restaurant lunch (bread with lean meat and lots of mayo and extras). I think there isnt really a one size fits all diet…i think staying with basic natural products is most important."

174366529,"Why medication naltrexone works so well for me. I’ve done my research, I’ve posted on anti-drinking medication sub Reddit’s, told my story to everyone from sub Reddit’s to my pharmacist to my psychiatrist, friends, family, fellow patients, etc… and no one has any remotely similar story to mine. Well first of all this drug increases my insight a great deal. Everyone tells me I’m some kind of miracle/anomaly or something for what this meds done for me. Maybe has to do with dopamine. When I took shrooms in May of 2014 while on the abilify injection +5 mg pill. and drank alcohol and caffeine too. It messed with my brain chemistry. Chronic panic attacks, anxiety, flashbacks, hppd, etc till I took naltrexone. Maybe it somehow cures me from that?? But it restores me to a point I’ve never been before in my life. Like even a healthy 10 year old, well you can’t really compare me after 19 years. But I’ve never felt this in control of my mind. It definitely has antipsychotic properties for me 
BEYOND healing me from a bad drug experience because now I require less abilify than before that bad shrooms trip even. But I can’t find anything on google about it. Not to mention a thicker skin, this drug has healed my brain, anxiety, mood improved and I don’t drink or crave illegal drugs anymore (which is it’s real purpose). Truly grateful, it’s been a great fortune to take this med. ps turns out I’m not having diarrhea from it. It was from coffee. And the only side effect I ever had was nausea, which has subsided with more time taking it. It’s a very well tolerAted med in general. Few side effects. I hit the jackpot on this one.

176096430,Yeah for sure. I’m curious if I wasn’t smoking pot if I’d have gone into onset but I guess it would have anyways with stress. I slowly slid into psychosis without smoking much weed in the end it’d just fock me up so yes. I look back and I was always different. I had a thought that commented on everything I did and remember ocd behavior in first grade of primary school. The trouble with sz is that it’s there.

176096437,"What I learned from AA is that the only way to truly ditch a bad habit is to replace it with a good habit. It’s easiest if you do this one habit at a time rather than trying to do them all at once. My current habit I’m trying to fix is snacking on rubbish. Fixing in two parts: Buying fresh fruit and healthier snacks so there’s no rubbish (crisps) on hand. Preparing ahead by cleaning and prepping fruit and veg. I’ve been roasting Brussels sprouts ahead. I’m happy to snack on a bowl of those if they’re cooked and I can nuke them. Same with fresh made pickles if I want a salty crunch, but those have to be prepped a day ahead. Fruit needs to be washed and bagged. Celery and cucumbers cut up ahead of time. If I do this, I snack better. If I don’t, I wind up in crisps or whatever box of crackers _USER_ID_ _PERSON_ has (I can’t get her to stop buying that crap)."

The BeneMin study aimed to replicate this benefit and to determine whether or not there was associated preservation of grey matter, reduction in circulating inflammatory cytokines and enhancement of cognition.To determine the efficacy of minocycline on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the mechanistic role of neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and cognitive enhancing actions.Two hundred and seven patients with a current research diagnosis of schizophrenia within 5 years of onset were randomised by a permuted blocks algorithm to minocycline (300?mg/day) or matching placebo as an adjunct to their continuing trea
tment. The primary efficacy outcome variable was the negative symptom subscale score from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales at 2, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary mechanistic (biomarker) variables were (1) medial prefrontal grey matter volume (GMV), (2) circulating cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 concentration and (3) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations during performance of the N-back task. Movement disorder, side effects and treatment adherence were monitored throughout the study.Compared with placebo, the addition of minocycline had no effect on the severity of negative symptoms [treatment effect difference –0.186, 95% confidence interval (CI) –1.225 to 0.854] across the 2-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up visits. None of the mechanistic biomarkers was influenced by minocycline: left GMV –91.2 (95% CI –303.8 to 121.4), IL-6 0.072 (95% CI –0.118 to 0.262) and N-back fMRI 0.66 (95% CI –1.53 to 0.20). There were no statistically significant trea
tment effects on any of the secondary outcomes and no group differences at baseline. Most measures were stable over the 12 months. Twenty-five out of the 29 serious adverse events were hospital admission for worsening psychiatric state, which affected 10 minocycline-treated participants and six placebo-treated participants.The addition of minocycline to standard treatment had no benefit on the symptoms of schizophrenia in this early phase sample. There was no evidence of a progressive neuropathic or inflammatory process affecting GMV.Although recruitment to target was achieved on time, only 43% (n?=?89) of the 207 randomised patients completed 12 months of the study. However, 83% of those who started treatment remained on it and were assessed over 6 months. By contrast, no follow-up data were available for the cognitive and imaging markers in those who dropped out before the final 12-month assessments, and this reduced the power to detect treatment effects on these mechanistic variables. Patients were not sel
ected for the presence of negative symptoms, and their initial overall psychopathology was, at most, moderate and, therefore, less likely to show treatment effects.The results of the study do not support the use of adjunctive minocycline for the treatment of negative or other symptoms of schizophrenia within 2–5 years of onset. More secure evidence of central inflammation is needed before further trials are conducted at other stages of psychosis.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN_PHONE_NO_.This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme, a Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institute for Health Research partnership.

174366561,"I don’t want to quit. I need the money to save for a masters. I do want to quit though because chronic fatigue is making it hard for me to go to work and actually do the work. I had a bad shift today. Maybe because I hadn’t eaten before for the entire day but also maybe because I was genuinely feeling ridiculously weak the entire day. I earn maybe 5k in a year from this job. I get maybe 3k from personal independence. And then something else around 2k savings from a loan for university. That’s the total for a masters. That above calculation would do me fine if it was the last year of my course, but it’s the second year. By the time it comes to applying for a masters and also completing the current undergraduate - I’ll have spent everything on the rent I pay to my parents, cigarettes and any other extras like a phone or Netflix. I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel hard done by by god. or luck. Because schizophrenia is hard enough. But the fatigue… that’s awful and renders you pra

Next two letters from the government arrived to my address but one was next door. I went outside to put it in their postbox and firstly was a black car with blacked out windows. Totally terrifying. Next a ‘workman’ closely watched my putting the letter into next doors letter box. This ???? is just too much

176096508,I’ve watched a person deteriorate over several years because of alcohol. It was my mother. I had known her have a fondness for drink from when I was about 8. It got worse over time especially when she retired from work at 65. In her early 70s she had about a 6 month stay in hospital. At 75 she went into hospital again. I visited but had difficulty getting to where she was because the ward seemed like a maze to me. I went once and she was very cutting to me. I didn’t go in again . She came out of hospital a few days before Christmas 2010 . She died December 30th 2010. My brother was there. I wasn’t. I think it was said (I’m not totally sure) she’d had a perforation in her stomach .

I’m like a zombie the last two weeks again. Not sure what’s going on with me. Probably have something else besides somataform disorder I think. I think definitely neurological. I dont know whether I am coming or going. Everything is too much on my brain. I am definitely not right. I feel like a dead weight. My head is so woozy. I cant do one thing properly. Everything is like swimming in my head. Something is very wrong that much I know. I think I’m very ill but what it is, I just don’t know. I go to do a task and end up forgetting that task and going to something else. My thoughts are when I wash a cup, you cant do it right. And that’s going on all day with everything. What is this, I cant add it up to somataform disorder because my symptoms feel a whole lot different to that. I mean I’m practically house bound with the walls caving in 
on me. Is this schizophrenia the losing train of thought and getting nowhere? Or am I suffering from a neurological illness on top of somataform disorder or is it schizophrenia, or psychosis? What is psychosis My psychiatrist knows I have these symptoms a d he says its somataform disorder but my whole life is a drunken woozy feeling drowsy and groggy and messy and awkward with my thoughts racing.

176096536,"_AT_MENTION_ Thanks. My drive to be social has never been high at the best of times. Some comments from my sister: _NAME_ was always very shy and quiet, and did not typically join in play with our other brother and me - I think partly because he did not seem to be able to engage in imaginary play, and found it difficult to truly ‘play’ as we did. To be honest I don’t know how much it ever really bothered him - I don’t ever recall him asking to join in, he seems much happier to do his own thing. _NAME_ was not confident in engaging with people he did not know. This combined with his physical awkwardness meant he was never as I recall very social at all. I also think that _NAME_ had a difficult time in ‘reading’ the emotions or feelings or reactions other people outside of the immediate family. He had no close friends in childhood or his teenage years that I am aware of. When he was home from boarding school _NAME_ again preferred to spend much of his time alone."

174366575,I read his book a year or two before I got ill. I was always interested in psychology anyways and found his book fascinating. My understanding was that his first book was about his descent into full blown schizophrenia. I also think he recovered and got a pretty good job as a professor at a university. My understanding also was that years later his diagnosis was changed from schizophrenia to being bi-polar.

176096552,I usually have difficulties with family gatherings . I feel uncomfortable around my brother and sister or it’s not a relaxed relationship. My mum (not their mum) said it’s because they don’t respect me. They seem to think they are higher rank or something and that I should salute them because I don’t work despite that I am the oldest. I don’t believe in saluting for me.its against my belief system. They have husband/wife.the sister is everything my father ever wanted and now she is going to give him a grandchild and he always said I should never have children but ofcourse she is good enough to breed in his opinion. I don’t feel comfortable around my family a lot of the time. It does depend who but sometimes I don’t even feel comfortable around my closest and I have had paranoia and delusions about them but don’t anymore. I even thought that my family was not my family at one point. I love them though. Last year I met my cousin from Sweden and her husband and I love them and they are 
so lovely and it was so nice to meet them. Not saying I was super relaxed but it was still nice to meet them and I even laughed when we watched tv together except they didn’t laugh and it wasn’t a comedy. I am living with my former stepmom who is the other woman that raised me and she gave me a car and has helped me and I feel a little uncomfortable meeting her family sometimes and that if they don’t think she should be helping me so much as she does and that some of them may not like me or have army like views I don’t agree with. There was recently a party and I avoided going but may then of been seen as rude. I love them and love seeing them around but still feel uncomfortable around them. I hope my relationship with my brothers and sister will get better and more relaxed. One of my brothers pays me to walk his dogs which is why I feel I can afford to go to the gym.he really helped me out with that. I usually say no to most family dinners. I was with my sister and dad the other day and had to leave 
early. She calls him dad and I don’t and she is everything he ever wanted and I’m everything he did not want lol but I’ve had delusions about him and did not believe he was my real father etc and then them being so close and him saying I should never have children but wanting her to have children and he told his x she is the only child he wants . I don’t know I just was t relaxed and feeling well so I had to tell them I had to leave. She said I looked good so could t be seen on the outside but I wasn’t feeling great so although my father was visiting from interstate I only ate pancakes then left immediately after . I love them but it could feel complicated. I do avoid get togethers. But I do love them. I get physical symptoms and fit like things when I am among people forced to hold conversation yet mute etc

174366577,My pdoc told me there are problems with getting the risperdal consta shot. I had my mum ask the pharmacist about it and they tried to get as many shots as they could but now I have 1 or 2 remaining and I am scared about if I can’t get the shot anymore. I’m finally stable on my current meds and it would suck that I would have to switch again. I get risperdal consta 50mg shot every 2 weeks and i take 200mg clozapine every day. pdoc said i might have to switch to the invega shot (not sure what it’s called again) but I really dread that thought cause it took me ages to get stable and i fear of relapse when i need to switch. Anybody else here on risperdal consta and having difficulty of getting their hands on shots?

Also depending on the cause other things might help next to meds…emdr, therapy, cbt, etc."
176096570,This is not a med I know much about. I couldn’t do prozac because it was messing with my bladder. So my doctor prescribed this one to take 1-2 times a day as needed. Of course I have anxiety and get stressed about everything every day so I really need to take it every day lol. Its an antihistamine. I wonder if it will help with my allergies and maybe my bladder too. I think it was pretty clever thinking on part of my doctor. I am just concerned that it could make me sleepy

I think there’s some truth to the law of attraction. But the sad part is that we can’t choose what cards we are dealt. What circumstances we are given that shape us the way we are.

174366585,"To me schizophrenia was just a terrible coping tool for me. Like I feel I have insight into how I developed it from abuse and trauma, and I used schizophrenia to cope with abuse and trauma. And it backfired and made everything a billion times worse. Even if I thought my delusions and fantasy world were helping at the time. Because I didn’t know any better. And every touch of grey has a silver lining. But I feel it’s like my mind developed schizophrenia because I couldn’t handle reality the way it is. But then, becoming schizophrenic, that’s a reality that was REALLY tough to handle. Maybe genetically there is some explanation for schizophrenia. Maybe when we evolved to humans there was some purpose of schizophrenia. Even if just to help the individual cope. I’m afraid we’ve stigmatized it and outlawed schizophrenics from society due to EPIgenetic evolution or de-evolution. But genetically we haven’t changed much in the same time. But I could be wrong."

174366593,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clinically Relevant Anti-Neuronal Cell Surface Antibodies in Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychobiology , May 2019 16 Schizophrenia is a phenotypically heterogeneous and poorly understood disorder. While its etiology is likely multifactorial, immune system dysfunction has increasingly been implicated in its development. As hallucinations and delusions occur frequently and prominently in autoimmune encephalitis (AE), numerous studies have sought to determine whether a small subset of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia possess anti-neuronal antibodies implicated in AE. Exploring this possibility is of clinical relevance, as identifying individuals with AE who have been misdiagnosed as having a primary psychotic disorder may allow for the implementation of appropriate immune-related therapies as early as possible in the course of the illness, in order to optimize outcomes, reduce illness chronicity, and minimize adverse events. This qualitative r
eview serves to provide an overview of the existing literature on this topic, as well as to update previously published reviews. Although there is some evidence to suggest that in rare cases AE may be misdiagnosed as a primary psychotic disorder, particularly early in the course of the illness, numerous methodological differences between studies likely account for the highly variable findings, and interpretation of the results is particularly limited by a paucity of cerebrospinal fluid data. Moreover, the prevalence of misdiagnosis in chronic and treatment-resistant populations remains understudied. This is particularly problematic, as treatment resistance may represent an enriched population with respect to the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies, and given that such patients have few evidence-based treatment options available to them beyond clozapine."

174366596,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Common vs. Distinct Visuomotor Control Deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, MO Krebs, _PERSON_ and I _PERSON_, Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism ResearchReferences, Mar 2020 10 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are neurodevelopmental disorders with partly overlapping clinical phenotypes including sensorimotor impairments. However, direct comparative studies on sensorimotor control across these two disorders are lacking. We set out to compare visuomotor upper limb impairment, quantitatively, in ASD and SCZ. Patients with ASD (N = 24) were compared to previously published data from healthy control participants (N = 24) and patients with SCZ (N = 24). All participants performed a visuomotor grip force-tracking task in single and dual-task conditions. The dual-task (high cognitive load) presented either visual distractors or required men
tal addition during grip force-tracking. Motor inhibition was measured by duration of force release and from principal component analysis (PCA) of the participant's force-trajectory. Common impairments in patients with ASD and SCZ included increased force-tracking error in single-task condition compared to controls, a further increase in error in dual-task conditions, and prolonged duration of force release. These three sensorimotor impairments were found in both patient groups. In contrast, distinct impairments in patients with ASD included greater error under high cognitive load and delayed onset of force release compared to SCZ. The PCA inhibition component was higher in ASD than SCZ and controls, correlated to duration of force release, and explained group differences in tracking error. In conclusion, sensorimotor impairments related to motor inhibition are common to ASD and SCZ, but more severe in ASD, consistent with enhanced neurodevelopmental load in ASD. Furthermore, impaired motor anticipation may r
epresent a further specific impairment in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are neurodevelopmental disorders with partly overlapping and partly distinct clinical symptoms. Sensorimotor impairments rank among these symptoms, but it is less clear whether they are shared or distinct. In this study, we showed using a grip force task that sensorimotor impairments related to motor inhibition are common to ASD and SCZ, but more severe in ASD. Impaired motor anticipation may represent a further specific impairment in ASD."

174366602,"You do what you can do. Who knows what you can do? Until you try. Most people have potential, you just have to find your “thing” i.e. something you’re good at, you just have to find your niche and work on your strengths. Sometimes other people see stuff in us that we can’t see in ourselves. Think about accomplishing something and bounce a few ideas off your family or your shrink and see what they think. That’s how I became employed. My first few years with schizophrenia I was just your average sick, psychotic run-of-the-mill paranoid schizophrenic. Just bouncing around hospitals that my parents got me into, no real plans or goals. When I was 21 I got out of the hospital after 8 months and my parents found me an extremely good group home to live in. The basic tenet of the founders was that mentally ill people did best with structure so we had regular chores, regular structured groups twice a week, planned outings, everybody had to take turns cooking for the entire house including staff. We 
had business meetings and scheduled times to take turns shopping for grocery’s. Everybody had to have a daily activity. We were expected to leave the house by 9:00 am and they locked the doors so no one could get back in until 3:00 pm. Some people went to school, others had jobs. I’m sorry I’m making this so long but I’m trying to illustrate something. Anyways to get to the chase, the agency that ran the house also had a vocational program and that was my daytime activity. The program held about 10-12 people who met in this big house and the ultimate goal was to go there and with training and classes to eventually become employed. It served a dual purpose as a place to socialize and do something productive with your day. So I got thrown in there with all these other people and as usual I was odd man out and was on the outside of a few cliques and I only talked to a couple of people and the popular people didn’t say one word to me for 9 months though we were all crammed together in this building four 
days a week. But a couple of things happened. I wanted to keep a low profile but we all had to take turns doing two things. Doing yardwork in the community or doing mailing projects for the post office. Those were the main activities of the program. So to do yardwork we all loaded a _NAME_ with yardwork equipment like a lawnmower, rakes, brooms, clippers etc. and we all piled inside and hit a few houses. The counselors were in charge but they designated one client to be supervisor of the 4 or 5 man crew. I never really desired to be supervisor but a counselor pushed me into it. That was my first step. My next step a short while later was running some old cash register the program leaders drug up from somewhere. The program informally sold stuff for lunches like sandwiches or yogurt or soup etc. and the staff picked people to run the cash register. Again, I had no desire to do that and I didn’t think I could even do it if I wanted to but a counselor kind of railroaded me into doing it. I’ll repeat: I was n
othing special, I didn’t stand out, I had no goals or any plans but then the staff created a position just for me and no one else; it was being groundkeeper for the building the vocational program was held in. I was responsible for the upkeep of the landscaping and they just let me do the work alone. I had no desire for that either, lol. But they thought I would be great at it so I did it. Next step which a counselor volunteered me for was taking a bus to the main office building of the agency to do really light janitorial work for about $30.00 a month. They rotated people in and out every three months but I did such a good job that they kept me there 6 months. It wasn’t hard, emptying a few wastebaskets, vacuuming, cleaning a unisex restroom, cleaning a couple tables. Again, I would never have volunteered or sought out these things but my main point is that the counselors saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself and they thought I could do these things and they picked me out of 11 or 12 of the o
ther clients to this. My last step to becoming employed was huge. The agency had arrangements with a few businesses in the community to place clients there for a short span of time. There was a restaurant and this other place that was a small family owned business to rent out hot tubs. This was the eighties and hot tubs were huge and very popular and my future boss and his wife built a business literally from the ground up. They owned a two story building and they sectioned the inside with 9 private rooms with a hot tub in each and some had saunas too. Each room had a bed, a shower, piped in music, plants, a phone. Anybody could rent one for like $5.75 an hour. It was perfectly legitimate and very upscale and clean. To be honest, most of the clientele were couples and to be even more honest, most of the couples were having sex in the rooms. But it was a genuine place to just enjoy soaking in a hot tub in a luxurious private room with no distractions. But my counselor got me placed there as a maintenance perso
n. I was 9 months out of the hospital at the time. I had been diagnosed just two years before and I was 22 years old. But out of 12 other clients, they picked me and one other guy to work there. So I started there and my job was to take care of the building. That meant cleaning, painting, scrubbing, fixing things, maintaining equipment, maintaining the hot tubs etc. The owners were a young couple and they were cool. The husband had a bad temper and could be an as*hole at times but he was alright. The wife was super cute and liked me. But the whole idea was to rotate new clients in every three months to work there. But the owners liked me and the other guy so much that I ended staying there 4 years! But yeah, that was 1985 and the start of my employment and I’ve worked ever since at various jobs and I’m 58 now. But I would never have thought I could do stuff like that but other people saw my potential which I couldn’t see in myself. As the years went by after that place, I usually find my own jobs and so
me have been where the job was connected to a mental health agency but most of my jobs I applied for and got hired just like any regular guy off the street. I believe everybody has potential you just need to bring it out whether someone helps you figure it out or you stumble on to it yourself."

176096687,"My uncle still hasn’t responded, so I am nervous. We are going to pay our rent late in order to have money on hand to go, just in case. This morning, however, I am told she drank some water and waved at a nurse. She still isn’t eating, though. So I don’t know what to think."
176096688,"Me too! I would have conversations with a man who was not there for about 4 years and was romantically infatuated with him for that time. It resulted in my divorce this year, too. Now that I’ve come crashing down into reality, I regret how my delusions ruined my life. And it all started even though I was being regular with my medication for 11 years. Go figure!"
176096689,"You wont become delusional of your strict about complying with your current medication regime. Yeah - side effects suck, but unfortunatley like most of us your gonna have to lump it and learn to cope."

176096691,Good for you _AT_MENTION_.
176096692,"I agree with both you and _PERSON_. I try to be nice and polite especially on this site. I know sometimes I become bothersome. The way I see it though is that every once in a while I might get a person to smile, sometimes even while they are in their sorrow or suffering. Now I can’t see them smile of course but the thought that for a brief moment some silly comment or honest compliment can change a person’s demeanor even if only for a moment, then that makes it worthwhile. Living with a mental illness can be a difficult and lonely path because many of us are misunderstood. Sometimes I myself feel a strange sort of sadness. I guess it is part of the suffering aspect of a mental illness. Then I check the forums and people make me smile too. It makes life easier somehow knowing that we’re not alone in the struggle. And _AT_MENTION_ , you’re doing alright in that regard. Knowing someone read my wall o’text I took a few minutes to type on my phone was helpful in preventing my suffering."
176096693,I didn’t really see much mentally ill Or I just wasn’t aware It’s nowhere in my family Just my uncle with LD. And I was never afraid of him.

176096709,"Before meds I was homeless, heavily abusing alcohol and cough medicine, sleeping in strangers’ houses when I could, sleeping in my car the rest of he time. I genuinely thought I was going to end up as a _NAME_ in a morgue somewhere. Once I found the right med, I was able to get secure housing, a full time job, hobbies, friends, a romantic relationship, and a life I loved. It was a slow process, but now here I am. It’s been six years on meds. I own a home, I had a very successful career which I have recently left because I’m in the process of adopting a teenager and I want to focus on raising him. I am married to my best friend in the world. I have learned how to form and maintain healthy relationships. Most importantly, I no longer hallucinate. It’s been nearly three years since I had my last hallucination."

176096726,Lol I was like wtf Invega decreases libido and not increase it lmao
176096727,"Uh, everybody has some kind of shitty character trait they would rather not have. And lots of people have self hate. It’s just part of being human. No one will ever be perfect. You’re just thinking of all your problems at the same time and that’s what gets people overwhelmed. I know it’s possible to “compartmentalize” because I do it all the time to survive. My life ain’t no picnic. Being me ain’t no picnic. I just kind of go with the flow and despite my problems I feel pretty good sometimes. I could get pretty depressed about my life but I choose to ignore some stuff, and put away other stuff for another time. You’re going to have the whole rest of your life to reflect on your shortcomings, so don’t focus on all of them now. I mean if schizophrenia wasn’t such a matter of life and death, your problems today would almost be funny. I’m not laughing at you but you miss a bus and suddenly the world is going to end and you’re this terrible, horrible person. You’re just an or
dinary schmuck like me, or anyone else, muddling through life having your ups and downs. Take care of yourself and put one foot in front of the other and keep going. “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference.” Work on your problems with your therapist. Maybe you did some bad things but you ain’t going to shock your therapist and she isn’t going to reject you. They’ve heard it all before and they take in stride the new depravities they hear from people. You got a lot of good advice here from everybody. If you need the hospital, then do what’s good for you and go. If you can sleep it off then maybe you’ll feel better in the morning."

So he went to the mall complex and bought a weather station, and a chemistry set. He then bought his wife a necklace. He then made one more purchase. So when he walked out of the store he walked up to the smoker and gave him some gloves. The smoker said, “I already have gloves and I’m not a bum. I just don’t want to set fire to my clothes.” The man said, “I have had relatives who smoked and I know how rough they make it on you. I used to tell them to simply quit but it just made them angry and agitated towards me. So I learned to accept it with them. These gloves are fire resistant so you won’t burn yourself using them. This is as much repentance as it is a nice gesture. Have a Mer

Im going to multiply that with 16 15 18 20 = 16 + 0 15 + 18 1+20 1 + 20 1+18* 2+15* 2= 140, then 332+140=472 / 99 = 4.767676 From the other posts we had the number 36 repeating and the number 0.02 If I divide 4.767676 with 2 I get 2.383838 if i then remove 2 from the front and also from the numbers I again get 363636 nsert _PHONE_NO_ 64 = 36 36 36 46 64= 36 36 36 110 = 108 -110 
= 2 means 0.02 Im 37 years old, how old are you? Im going to say this also just to make no sense (84 28 4 48, 7 d ok fast) Im not really who you think I am…Im actually a university student who excelled in Math. But Im also a human being who prefers cats over dogs, grunge over heavy metal and women not men."
176096804,Yes most days off I am practically bed ridden because of my poor functioning. All I can do is sleep. I become overwhelmed even when thinking of doing things I like to do like playing videogames. It is making my life miserable. I can only function in a work setting.
174366643,It’s the luck of the draw. Every case of schizophrenia is different and hits people differently. People are on a different timeline. You can’t predict how it will run it’s course. Another factor is how well you can hide it and how well you can control the symptoms. I was able to work while psychotic but no one knew because I looked half-way normal and acted perfectly normal. But I was severely ill for two years in the beginning. And my symptoms were pretty strong for years afterwards but I worked anyways.

Luckily I am somewhat okay with living with family for the rest of my life. It’s not fun and desiresble but it can work. I hope it doesn’t be like this but I do have to keep my expectations realistic. A family would be lovely, but that happening has chances against us. You and me have both accepted this and I think that is good for us. We will get things in good measure, god, luck and karma usually work like that."

When I quit drinking my sanity really came back a lot. Not only all that but I was powerless over it. I at least have some control of other things I tried. Maybe some szs can handle a bit of alcohol but that’s not me. I don’t think it’s good for the liver. My Psych doctor I’ve told him I’m an alcoholic on countless Occasions but he insists “you can drink 1-2 max”. Or often says “as long as you limit yourself to one-two beers…”. Or “you don’t wanna become an alcoholic!” He once said. I like alcohol (or used to a bit) but now it makes me sick"

I clean, go for walks, and generally pretend to be “normal”. I should add that the other posts are correct. You should tske the episodes seriously.

You gotta take meds if you aren’t already so you can focus on living your life instead of being trapped in meaningless delusions. It sounds like your mind is in a bad place so if you quit your meds for some reason I recommend taking them again asap so your mind calms down and you get in touch with reality again.

Last week or so, I had the feeling that I had two feet on my left foot, another night I felt as if my eyes we’re backwards, and another time I was going back to bed and I seen my shadow and the fact part of it was missing and I then felt as if my face was missing as well and believed that my own shadow was what I looked like not only that but ever since I was a kid I’ve had this feeling that my body and surroundings are distorting. And when I’m sleeping I have these nightmares and before I go to bed or wake up I’ll hear these voices saying that I should die and everyone hates me and then I have these scary visual images beh

176096938,Yes it is… And cold to boot
176096939,It’s about function. Most of us don’t have a choice. Psychosis and things like depression are most likely brain damage. You don’t know till you try them. It really isn’t an exact science but the general rule of thumb is that side effects increase with dosage. It was more prevalent with the earlier meds like thorazine…ie the thorazine shuffle. The modern atypicals usually are better but the general rule is take as little as possible to get the best function. I still get symptoms but I’m happy with my lot. I haven’t changed doses or meds for well over a decade… These things you need to talk to your shrink about. A good shrink has a good idea about things.

176096941,"Hey, these are powerful drugs. I can’t describe what happens if you take too much of a certain drug because they are all different and everybody’s physiology is different so medications affect people differently. (which is why doctors prescribe different doses of the same medication for different people). All I know is that my best thinking made me take extra prolixen when I was on it to try to make me drowsy so I could sleep. My reasoning was that these drugs are sedating so they could be used as tranquilizers. (my IQ was once tested as -58). Anyways, I was living by myself and bored out of my mind and I was tired and wired at the same time and I couldn’t fall asleep so I took extra pills and the effect was not what I planned at all. It did not put me to sleep but it sure made me feel terrible. That was 25 years ago though. I take my medication exactly as prescribed since then but just about three years ago I accidentally doubled down on my nightly meds and took two doses of Resperidone. I c
an’t put into words how I felt except if it gotten even a tiny bit worse than it was I was seriously considering going to the hospital. I felt that bad, but I toughed it out and got a good nights sleep and felt “normal” the next morning. These drugs are nothing to fool around with."
176096942,I cope by staying on my meds. If I have a problem I got to the er or crisis. I worry about my neighbors all time delusions. I keep myself busy or go talk to mum friend. I just want you to know you’re loved.

It was nice to have balanced meals at regular intervals throughout the day. Another thing that was pretty consistent was the use of benzos. They gave me a lot of Ativan. One hospital gave me so much I can barely remember being in there. Some of the hospitals had regular groups to attend. Some of the hospitals you just stayed in bed. Some of the hospitals had day rooms where you could go to watch tv or draw or read a book. All hospitals had a pdoc, most had a therapist or psychologist. There are a ton of nurses. The other patients can cause problems when they have symptoms by having outbursts and tantrums."

176096980,LS! I have been on 2 milligrams of Risperdal for years. I functioned quite good those days. Sorry to say but chances are that you have to use medication for the rest of your life. Nowadays I am on 4 milligrams Risperdal. Regarding your questions I do not feel qualified to answer them.

In that 6 weeks there I has such a fantastic time. I think back and think it was better then some holidays abroad I’ve had. I was totally manic. I think this is where my addiction to being manic comes from. Do you think me telling him this would make sense to him?"

He’s in therapy for ODD, but umm. We’re having issues with his young female therapist a little too, friendly touchy with him. She often tells me she misses him a lot when her schedule is filled and his spots are not every other week.

174366695,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ The best thing to do is tell your psychiatrist exactly what you told us. They may switch you to something else or ask you to tough it out for a while to see if it settles down. I remember when I went on abilify (which is similar to vraylar) the first few weeks were tough. I hope things turn out ok for you.

CRISPRi doesn’t cause DNA damage, it is inducible and reversible, and it partially knocks down target genes, rather than completely deleting them, which allows the functional characterization of essential genes."

I really thought life wasn’t worth living at one point. However my anhedonia went away for the most part, along with other symptoms, it all just suddenly disappeared… with the rest of my symptoms I could manage to function ok as a balancing act.

My local chapter offers support groups, family support groups, something called a “warmline” to call for non-crisis situations just to vent and get support. They offer a lot more too. I know a lot of people with schizophrenia have a hard time filling their day with things to do so their groups are held through zoom or just by phone.

They were testing a blood pressure medication to see if it would be a good adjunctive treatment for treatment resistance in schizophrenia. I only completed a few weeks of it because the med made my blood pressure drop to dangerously low. My psychiatrist reached out to me again to potentially be part of an art therapy study to see how it affects negative symptoms, I think I’m going to try it. Has anyone else here participated in a study? If so, what were your experiences?"

I need to look at my partner and admire their beauty, and I rarely find myself admiring anyone’s intelligence. So for me, it is an important quality, and that’s not something I can really choose."

Then the pdoc showed the patient another ink blot and asked him what he saw. The patient said he saw a bunch of people having an orgy.

176097099,"So, I just got back from my psych APRN. She is going to put me on Invega. I just got back from the pharmacy, as well, and the insurance said they won’t pay for it. Grrrrr! So now my doctor has to convince my insurance company that the Invega is a necessary medication. I asked the doctor about me working part-time. She was all for it. She said, “Definitely! Stress makes your illness worse! And you’ve got so many symptoms!” I’m happy to have her support and opinion on the matter. I then asked her what she thinks about me applying for disability benefits. She said that would be really good for me and gave me advice on filing. She says I should file as soon as possible because it might take a really long time to be approved. She also stated that I need to get a lawyer, to help me get approved. My doctor said that she’d even sign/fill out an RFC form (basically a form that tells SSA that I’m disabled enough to not work full-time). I’ll see my doctor in 2 weeks for a follow-up visit after 
the medication change and to talk about the disability situation some more. I’ll first see how this new med, Invega, helps me out. If it is a miracle drug, maybe I won’t need to apply for disability. But if it is not a miracle drug, I will talk to my boss about me working part-time and then apply for disability benefits. So, yeah. I’m starting a new medication… as soon as insurance agrees to cover it. And I’m going to talk to my boss about me working part-time instead of full-time."

It’s just difficult because your mind and heart are in conflict and your mind is trying to convince your heart to change. It took me a long time to learn that and get over someone. I started talking to someone new, and now I think I am in the same position you are. I think it will be easier this time to get over him and move on."

There is no toilet paper in my city now, or bleach or sanitizer. When the shelter in place went into effect, nobody but the homeless advocate tried to do anything about the homeless people that were already living in unsanitary conditions with no access to water and shelter (she was formerly homeless, now she is an advocate). The city council made promises of mobile wash stations but that never happened. The homeless advocate lady is still out there with the homeless encampments trying to get them supplies. Just saw her livestream on facebook where she was talking 
about how they have no access to bathrooms and are using a bucket for all of them because there’s no other choice. I messaged her today to donate one new bottle of concentrated bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and some cough/cold over counter pills. I think she will be willing to drive to my house to pick them up. I feel a particular sadness when i think about being homeless because I know it could’ve been me if it weren’t for my mother, abilify, and a few jobs here and there. I’m broke until next week’s last paycheck, but for now i can offer some of what i had stockpiled before the store shelves were empty.

This is the case when I’m unwell because I have paranoia and anxiety so always have my support staff with me. I can get Confrontational with people when paranoid. This is way I was awarded high rate benefits. Sometimes I’m in remission. I’m in remission now so if I were to go on holiday on my own without support would this be a contradiction in me needing benefits? If sometimes I can’t catch a bus alone but then travel to a strange country alone, navigating airports, budgeting my money.

My meds were increased last year after being hospitalized for not taking them and gradually I am doing much better and believe I am on the best possible dose. I also started last year doing things in 15 min increments. Like cleaning the house better, laundry, ironing, walking anything really. I can do anything for 15 minutes. Then it just built over the months. But still struggling with self study. Haven’t signed up for classes yet. Want to make sure i am commited. But that also means i have no support right now and no real goal except to learn the theory i need to sign up. Going on 12 months of this with barely any study in the last 6 months. Maybe it is not what i am suppose to be doing. But i do get sucked into self help and the internet in my free time a lot. So wasted time. I started tracking my daily time expenditure.

I find myself looking for things to fill the time while I’m job hunting. Volunteering helps but I only do that twice a week. Otherwise I am doing a lot of reading spiritual books to pass the time. I am not hungry, but I’m bored so I want to eat. It’s fairly easy to fight that off, I recognize that I’m not really hungry. But the temptation to eat is there."

Then it’s time for lunch and meds and after lunch i always watch a movie, then i spend some time on the computer and have din dins. Then it’s time for meds again and i listen some music and browse the forum here. Then i start watching evening tv (news and soap) and i have my meds, then some more tv and then sleeping when i crash cause of evening meds. I notice the routine helps me. I also go for a 1.5 hours walk every week."

And a higher likelihood of developing permanent motor dysfunction like tardive dyskinesia.

How common are the somatics in sz??

I felt like It was a cookie cutter therapy lesson that’s tailored to anyone with depression so I gave it a few more shots and she didn’t really talk at all. She just wanted me to talk. I would get uncomfortable silence if we just sat there so I started babbling about and I felt what I was saying was trivial.

Mathematics seeks to find out the qualities of numbers. Yet numbers are ideals. Form is always in flux, so cannot be a number, yet we perceive it as such. A car has a price, a number that has a quality. The car in itself has a quality, but the car is not a number. The price is the ideal that applies to the car. I am still obsessed with the price being zero, yet even this does not mean it is free. Thank you."
176097297,"My Dr said omega 3 are fine but said too much caffeine is bad for schizophrenics. Some supplements interact with meds. Smoking also interacts with some antipsychotics like Clozapine and Seroquel, reducing their effectiveness. Alcohol and weed should be avoided with meds too."

176097299,The leap of faith is take the medications. The delusions become less problematic and you can live life without a lot of the paranoia. If you spend your life chasing shadows then all you’ll see is things that aren’t real or important. Delusions are very seductive but would suggest you avoid triggering things like researching alternative theories on the interwebs. It’s hard to escape the rabbit hole…

I tried to abstain before, but I failed. Not this time. Plus the porn industry is satanic with their brainwashing.

176097319,"Sorry to hear you had some painful social experiences _AT_MENTION_ . I hear you, people can be so cruel. I’m sure you’re a terrific person. When I get offended or humiliated by people it triggers my psychotic/rage symptoms. I’ve had psychotic symptoms (imaginary conversations) my whole life, they were caused by child abuse (and genes) so they go back a long way & are tied to unprocessable memories. I wonder if you could process your trauma in therapy if that could treat the voices? I managed to process a trauma memory in therapy once & it stopped my symptoms. Only problem was it didn’t last as the trauma was so extensive & early in life. It sounds like with some considerable effort you’re able to enjoy social life so that’s cool. Your point that voices are linked to how powerful you think you are in social life is an interesting one & seems highly relevant to you. Maybe there are some ways you could increase how powerfully you see yourself in social life?"

174366778,"It will take you longer than the average student, but it is doable. You have to be willing to put in the extra time. Take more time to study, take more time to read, be very organized, go through all the notes, digest everything your professor says you should. Be an A+ student, however hard it is. I am a straight A student with schizophrenia in college because I work my ass off for it. Also, it sounds like you are doing the right things. Take breaks, understand yourself, enjoy what you are learning, that definitely helps a lot. Stay ahead . That’s probably another really good piece of advice I can give you. If an assignment is due in two weeks, start the next day, and chip away slowly so you aren’t stressed and have plenty of time to get things done. I think procrastination will lead to anxiety and worsening of symptoms. So again, know your limitations and learn to adapt and work around it. And as _AT_MENTION_ said, just do it.

174366773,"I think it would depend on a lot of factors. One thing would be which medication it is. The same medication taken by two people can affect them differently. Thus, the need for so many different medications. Peoples physiology are different, that’s why people end up as basically Guinea pigs. There’s no guarantee when someone gets ill that the first medication they are put on will work for them. That’s why doctors just have to use their experience and give a person what they think and hope will work and wait and see what happens. Hell, I was on prolixen for almost twenty years until the doctor wanted to change me to a second generation medication to lessen my chances of getting TD. He tried me on a few of the new ones like Zyprexa and Seroquel. He put me on abilify and two weeks later I was at an employment agency for the disabled and the counselor asked why I was pushing my hair out of my eyes constantly. I wasn’t aware of how much I was doing it until he pointed it out but it was constantly 
and it turns out the culprit was a side effect of abilfy and my doctor took me off it almost immediately and I ended up on resperidone and now I’m still on it twenty years later. But you might have a totally different reaction. I don’t know, of course a doctor went through years of college and training and might have years of experience prescribing medication so it’s good to trust his opinion but often even they can’t predict how a certain medication will effect someone for sure. The severity of your illness will play a factor, maybe your age or medical history. Your physical health."

176097429,Up until my last stay I would have said no. Been about 10 times now. But this last time I enjoyed not having constant contact with the world. I was free to just sit and zone out and it was mostly quiet until it wasnt. But I was also living in a fantasy world in my head. When I got out I felt scared of all the noises and people. I would absolutely go again if need be without much hesitation. It’s like a mental health vacation on some levels. You also dont have to do any chores which is nice.

If you can walk outside and hopefully get some sunshine, that would be good, too. When I get depressed, I put on a favorite show, with a cup of hot tea.

My advice to you is, expect side effects for the first few weeks, but know they’ll subside again. And remember some meds take up to two months to reach full effect, so don’t give up if you don’t feel better after a week. Antipsychotics are not dangerous. I can understand you’re hestitant about them, but don’t worry. you’ll find the one that works for you. And we’re here for you in the meantime"

176097528,"From my observations, many people suffer from long-term mental illness, like depression or anxiety, if they are struggling with a physical illness. It’s not just us. You have a greater community there, too. When I got diagnosed with a degenerative disease, I was relieved but I was like, “How on earth am I going to get through this?” and after a while despair sets in. It’s repeated in others. In my neuromuscular community, I have seen posts regarding depression, suicide, breakdowns, etc. When you are struck with a diagnosis like this, you often lose hope as your body gives up on you. For me, I was losing hope from time to time- in just short 5 months after my dx. If you ever feel alone, please don’t be. You have thousands and thousands of people who can resonate with you. So don’t give up. Do you struggle with a physical illness? If so, how does it impact your mental illness/sz?"

174366839,My concept about schizophrenia is that Schizophrenia is particularly further continuous fertilization of soul. As man’s sperm and woman egg’s fertilized to baby than it continue and man’s sperm soul and woman egg’s soul meet and after some year it becomes God. It is not necessary that the process may complete in all schizophrenics. Some where in this forum I wrote that after some million years animal’s body converted into his brain and another body form out side of it. Brains main function is thinking. So results of this fertilization the formed supernatural has made of thought thought and thoughts.

176097563,Ok. Risperidone didn’t work for me.
176097564,I was on 600 mg Pregabaline as well. I had a lot of mixed depression and anxiety after i weaned off. It got better after a month. Perhaps a small dose of a mild benzo like oxazepam could help in a short period?

Now I have to live in a crappy place, I can’t even sit in my own apartment half the time, because of the nutcases harassing me to death. All those greedy liars probably have houses and everything they want, and abuse me every day so some liar isn’t jealous of people.

176097573,I’m nearly 62 now and started having symptoms when I was 30 or so. Last summer I switched to Abilify and my pdoc gave me 5mg of it. My symptoms came back close to what they were when I was 30. I’m now on 15mg and rational again. So I would say without medication my symptoms haven’t gotten any better with age.

176097659,"One song that reminds me of what being a unified personality means is this one by Audioslave: Be Yourself. Its about being true to who you are. I did this by accepting therapy for 10 years, and telling people about what I would do. I didnt like it, but now I understand, that there was some rules from the goverment that said, that I and others are responsible for therapy if they dont want psychiatric abuse. The law is now changed, and I insist that it is bad to say that you can control us poor people in scandinavia by claiming that the government can show up at our houses reguarly, or even place people in locked wards. They have to resume responsibility for this, in that the law works both ways, if they judge my character as to individualistic, then they also must accept themselves the human rights. Human rights such as privacy can be abolished but the right to family life and security cannot. I was stolen money from my bank account by some officials from the government which was only the tip of the 
iceberg in manipulating me into being a scapegoat for the political conflicts at the time. Lets call it the campaign for freedom of expression, okay? Anyway I believe that Audioslave is great song and I wonder if its the singer or the band that makes for a top grunge experience. I think its the singer. I wonder what band would make for a similar exeprience to prove my point. I found this music video and I decided that Audioslave is similar to them. These are songs I would call romantic, even if many find them simple. At least Its what I listened to when I needed some european company in the Philippines.

A person who is really ill psychotic or freshly psychotic generally will not have awareness of their illness and will deny being ill even when it is clear to other people. Anxious talking would be talking really fast or maybe with a higher pitched or quivering voice. Disorganized talking is constantly jumping from topic to topic with no logical flow between topics. Like saying “I went to the store today. I love tacos. Did you know I saw this TV show last night? The first president of the US was _NAME_” etc. Though usually in psychotic patients it jumps from rational content to delusional content, for example “I had an argument with my husband, the state is watching me and putting spies on my block, and I really like spaghetti, but those aliens have been doing tests on me…” etc"

Her roommate decides to try to help her by fixing her up on a blind date. The guy comes over Saturday night and picks up the girl and takes her to the county fair. They’re strolling along, passing the game booths and the food booths and the guy turns to the girl and says, “What do you want to do?” She replies, "" I want to get weighed."" So he takes her to the booth where if they can’t guess your weight, then you win a prize. She steps on the scale and the carny guesses wrong so she wins a stuffed animal. They walk away and 5 minutes later the guy turns to the girl and says, "" What do you want to do now?"" She says, "" I want to get weighed"". He thinks, "" That’s pretty weird"", but he takes her back, the fair worker can’t guess her weight she wins another stuffed animal. They walk off and he asks her again but by this time he’s fed up with 
how the dates going and he tells himself, "" If she says that one more time, that’s it. This date is over"". He asks her one more time what she wants to do. She says, "" I want to get weighed"". He loses it. He blows up in anger, grabs her by the hand drags her to the booth; another stuffed animal.He grabs her hand, pulls her angrily to the car and drives her home while silently fuming. The girl gets inside and her roommate says, "" How did the date go"" The girls replies, "" Wousy""."

If the camera was in your ear you could wear headphones/earbuds to block it. If the camera was in your nose you could wear a medical or fashion face mask to block its vision. After this, there are 0 openings left to place the camera in. If you don’t want to do this, you could try clozapine. If you don’t want to do this, convince a psychiatrist or other specialist to give you a referral for x ray imaging. Or go with self referral if it is possible. If they don’t agree to, find a more open minded psychiatrist who would be willing to aid you to overcome your delusion using an unorthodox method like this. Maybe try a private clinic - money might make them more open minded. Hold a metallic or metal containing item (a phone for example) next to your body (while not blocking the body on x ray image) on every image they take, to ensure they are showing you real

Have you tried exercising? For me, I can’t read as of now and can’t watch movies. On the other hand, I can exercise and I do so for many hours a day. I also play chess at a decent level. What I advise you to do, is to find an occupation, not necessarily a job, not necessarily a “normie” occupation like watching TV or playing computer games, but something that you can do, that you are relatively successful at, that can occupy your time and give you a sense of meaning and fulfillment. Examples of such things: aerobic training on exercise machines, and strength training on exercise machines. I do these, these are awesome for my health, and they take many hours of my time every day. Other options that I used to do( although these did not fit me well health wise, they may suit you): Going to sauna, going to tannin
g salon. Another awesome option: You can check out how good you are at chess. If you have at least some talent, you can become a “professional” chess player, practice and play in competitions. It won’t bring you income, but it is absolutely a meaningful activity that will bring you joy, fulfillment and contentment in life.

The glial cells, especially microglia and astrocytes in brain regions of hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are major components of CNS innate immunity. Moreover, purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel 7 (P2X7R) was recently reckoned as a pivotal regulator in central immune system. Besides, it was pointed out that clemastine, a first-generation histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) antagonist with considerable safety profile and pharmacological effect
, may suppress immune activation through modulating P2X7R. Herein, we investigated the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effects of clemastine on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behavior in a mouse model. Methods: Male BALB/c mice were subjected to CUMS for 4 weeks, some of them were injected with clemastine fumarate solution. After the stress procedure, behavioral tests including Sucrose Preference Tests (SPTs), Tail Suspension Tests (TSTs) and locomotor activities were performed to evaluate depressive-like phenotype. Subsequently, expression of cytokines and microglia-related inflammatory biomarkers were assessed. Results: In the present research, we found that clemastine significantly reversed both the declination of SPT percentage and the extension of TST immobility durations in depression mouse model without affecting locomotor activity. Also, we observed that clemastine regulated the imbalance of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) and tumor ne
crosis factor alpha (TNF-?) in the hippocampus and serum of depressive-like mice. Additionally, clemastine significantly suppressed microglial M1-like activation specifically in the hippocampus, and also improved hippocampal astrocytic loss. Furthermore, clemastine downregulated hippocampal P2X7R without interfering with the expression of HRH1. Conclusion: As a safe and efficient anti-allergic agent, clemastine could impressively alleviate stress-related depressive-like phenotype in mice. Further evidence supported that it was because of the potential function of clemastine in modulating the expression of P2X7 receptor possibly independent of HRH1, therefore suppressing the microglial M1-like activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release in brain regions of hippocampus rather than mPFC. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clemastine rescues myelination defects and promotes functional recovery in hypoxic brain injury. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _P
ERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain : a journal of neurology, 2018 01 01 Hypoxia can injure brain white matter tracts, comprised of axons and myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to cerebral palsy in neonates and delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) in adults. In these conditions, white matter injury can be followed by myelin regeneration, but myelination often fails and is a significant contributor to fixed demyelinated lesions, with ensuing permanent neurological injury. Non-myelinating oligodendrocyte precursor cells are often found in lesions in plentiful numbers, but fail to mature, suggesting oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation arrest as a critical contributor to failed myelination in hypoxia. We report a case of an adult patient who developed the rare condition DPHL and made a nearly complete recovery in the setting of treatment with clemastine, a widely available antihistamine that in preclinical models promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation. This sug
gested possible therapeutic benefit in the more clinically prevalent hypoxic injury of newborns, and we demonstrate in murine neonatal hypoxic injury that clemastine dramatically promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, myelination, and improves functional recovery. We show that its effect in hypoxia is oligodendroglial specific via an effect on the M1 muscarinic receptor on oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We propose clemastine as a potential therapy for hypoxic brain injuries associated with white matter injury and oligodendrocyte precursor cell maturation arrest."

176097923,"Last time I purposedly went off meds, I got myself a nice long stay in the psych ward. And that’s not a place I want to be in more than I absolutely have to.

Negative symptoms have previously been associated with reduced blood folate levels, especially among patients with low-functioning variants in genes that regulate folate metabolism, suggesting the potential utility of folate supplementation.To determine whether folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation reduces negative symptoms of schizophrenia and whether functional variants in folate-related genes influence treatment response.Parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 weeks of treatment with 2 mg of folic acid and 400 ?g of vitamin B12.Three community mental healt
h centers affiliated with academic medical centers in the United States.Outpatients with chronic schizophrenia who were psychiatrically stable but displayed persistent symptoms despite antipsychotic treatment. Eligible patients were 18 to 68 years old, were treated with an antipsychotic agent for 6 months or more at a stable dose for 6 weeks or more, and scored 60 or more on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.One hundred forty subjects were randomized to receive daily oral folic acid plus vitamin B12 or placebo.Change in negative symptoms (Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms [SANS]), as well as positive and total symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale).Folate plus vitamin B12 improved negative symptoms significantly compared with placebo (group difference, -0.33 change in SANS score per week; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.05) when genotype was taken into account but not when genotype was excluded. An interaction of the 484C>T variant of FOLH1 (rs202676) with treatment was observed (P = .02), whe
re only patients homozygous for the 484T allele demonstrated significantly greater benefit with active treatment (-0.59 change in SANS score per week; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.18). In parallel, we observed an inverse relationship between red blood cell folate concentration at baseline and 484C allele load (P = .03), which persisted until 8 weeks of treatment. Change in positive and total symptoms did not differ between treatment groups.Folate plus vitamin B12 supplementation can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but treatment response is influenced by genetic variation in folate absorption. These findings support a personalized medicine approach for the treatment of negative symptoms.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT_PHONE_NO_.

176097975,I understand that. I was like that with an old best friend. I just wanted her to be happy and safe. She had gotten herself into a bad situation and I tried to help her get out of it. I think it comes across as judging sometimes though. So it’s good you’re focusing on not doing it anymore

174366941,"_PERSON_ HILL, NC – April 16, 2020 –> Most research about the genetics of schizophrenia has sought to understand the role that genes play in the development and heritability of schizophrenia. Many discoveries have been made, but there have been many missing pieces. Now, UNC School of Medicine scientists have conducted the largest-ever whole genome sequencing study of schizophrenia to provide a more complete picture of the role the human genome plays in this disease. Published in Nature Communications , the study co-led by senior author _PERSON_, PhD, associate professor in the UNC Department of Genetics, suggests that rare structural genetic variants could play a role in schizophrenia. _NAME_, MD, the Yeargen Distinguished Professor of Psychiatry and Genetics at the UNC School of Medicine and Director of the Center for Psychiatric Genomics, is co-senior author. “Our results suggest that ultra-rare structural variants that affect the boundaries of a specific genome structure increase risk for 
schizophrenia,” _PERSON_ said. “Alterations in these boundaries may lead to dysregulation of gene expression, and we think future mechanistic studies could determine the precise functional effects these variants have on biology.” http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2020/april/whole-genome-sequencing-reveals-genetic-structural-secrets-of-schizophrenia"

176098002,When I got SSDI I also got a retirement check from the Marine Corps and a disability check from the VA. I made plenty of money without working but I obviously make more now working. I still get that retirement check and the VA disability check. I paid a lot of money into Social Security. I got $2500 a month from it so it paid me better than minimum wage. My SSDI stopped in June of 2019. I have 3 years of extended eligibility. I own two four bedroom houses and have six cars insured. They didn’t look at any of that but I had 7 year reviews and I never had one. I was only on SSDI for 3 or 4 years. Maybe if you also work they might look at your finances. They never looked at mine. But if I get fired I am going to get my SSDI back. I just have to give them the termination letter to turn it back on.

I’ve done both those things now but those first years my life was strictly fighting not to go crazy. But you just never know. Sometimes things work out if you take your medication and just keep plugging away, We’ve all suffered but people on here have done some pretty fantastic (and cool) stuff in their lives despite the diagnosis."

It is really up to you what you want to do, but if I were in your shoes I would do what I had to if I seriously needed disability, or just keep on working and support yourself till you get another hospitalization.

176098147,"The DSM mentions that it may be difficult to distinguish delusions from strongly held beliefs. This is of course true. Both the degree of conviction and the content of the belief are factors in classification. A funny or even bizarre idea, in my view, is merely an idea or belief, albeit a funny or bizarre one, in the absence of rigid conviction. If a person is not even willing to discuss “thought experiments” concerning the belief, then in my mind, it is a delusion, perhaps even if its content is ordinary. In practice, this is an abstract or “academic” discussion, and what really matters is the idiosyncrasies of the particular diagnostician classifying us. As for me, a lot of my beliefs are not even “beliefs”, only currently favoured working hypotheses. In other words, I struggle (or at least have struggled) with pathological doubt. -A."

I feel stable and functional I still have racing thoughts here and there and my depression is starting to go away but other than that I am doing and looking good according to my psychiatrist. I go to the gym 3 - 4 days out of the week, work as a cashier about 42 hours a week, maintain my hygiene, I’m not delusional, don’t hallucinate, have insight into my illness, don’t talk to myself, and overall have started to feel a lot better since about a year ago. It was very tough but I’ve managed to hang in there and it seems to be getting better with time. I still get vivid dreams and have slight insomnia but other than that I feel good. I listen to podcasts, read books, talk to friends, post on 
this website to help others and try to stay active and busy. I try to stay motivated by thinking about achieving financial independence because I don’t want to be working forever so that’s what keeps me going and maintaining a stable lifestyle and I try to think about my family in the process who have supported me in my recovery. I worked towards it too and it is paying off. Hang in there man because it will get better with time."

My dad died of a massive heart attack in 2013, when I was 33. I handled his death much better than I did my mom’s. I sometimes feel bad that I never even cried over my dad’s death, though I do still miss both of my parents. All of my grandparents are dead, as well. Not much close family left."
176098188,"they dont dock you based on your hours worked, if you are employed by someone else. it’s based on how much money you make. trial work periods, substantial gainful activity. if you are self employed they dock you based on hours worked and/or income. the trial work periods and SGactivity still apply but they also cap you at 80 hours per money. i would think it’s a good idea to not go past 80 hours per month even if you are employed, because it starts to make you look like u can work more. i dont think they usually say you are able bodied if you stay below substantial gainful activity, but it’s possible they will say that, though. so you have to be careful."

My mother wants me to write fiction, however, I am not too interested in it. I want to write about my personal experiences and also to convey information/ advice to others. So, we shall see. I don’t think I will make too much money from writing. I will write for my enjoyment and see how far I can go by working on it. I really want to go to grad school for writing.

174367006,"Warning this turned into a more detailed rant about my thoughts and personal experiences while I am able to convey them in the best way possible. Im so shocked by my experiences its sort of traumatic to try and dissect them to relate. But if you are sensitive or in a bad state of mind dont read this, or if you are easily paranoid/maybe only those who can handle or possibly offer insight even relate to this should read what i am writing. I dont sugarcoat it this is what I am experiencing, I dont know that i am psychic or just intuitive. But right now i am stuck on something and it helps to vent/release. Some things are getting better for me. But today I just felt so empty. Like disillusioned with the world and unhappy. I get stressed because if I let things go and assume others are going to help me, nothing gets done. Like with my ER bill the hospital is trying to hold me responsible for bills even though I was fully insured through medicaid in 2018. No one wants to pay/take responsibility and I can
t afford it and medicaid says they paid top/max for everything so I shouldnt have owed any money to the ER for x-rays or anything. I have gotten off the Aristada injections and my metabolism, blood flow, energy levels have actually improved. I now take Abilify 10mgs, Hydroxizine 25mgs every night. Im being put on a beta-blocker waiting for them to sort that out with the insurance. I have my cpap still trying to get used to it and working on using it more. I’ve been stretching for the past few days like yoga and crunches. I can touch my toes again, couldn’t a few days ago. Sudden burst of energy, not sure maybe weather related. Just drinking lots of coffee. Took Allegra tonight and I am not tired/relaxed and calm. Can’t over-do that only take one because it has pseudoephedrine in it. But it was effective in calming my nerves and helping with the sinus issues. Also used flonase. I deleted my twitter account. Im making myself look bad saying all sorts of random things. I guess i should be used to embarassi
ng myself online. Im not hallucinating or hearing voices much. Have not really since I was taken off Seroquel and Geodon many years ago, they seemed to have side effects that worsened it/Seroquel caused epileptic like seizures to worsen hallucinations. Geodon caused fatigue, and automatic voices after I was put on it 10 years ago so I never went back on that. I dont trust doctors much anymore, Im scared to get the flu shot or covid vaccine. In experience, being baker acted and so rebellious, its hard to have retrospect. Plus Im weighing my teenage rebellious confused years with my 31 year old adult self, and trying to make sense of my life. Trying to move on with no sense of direction still stuck in the same place. I’ve lived in the same place 16 years/ tried college and failed, tried working and failed. Each time stress induced hallucinations and then the second attempt stress induced drug abuse/also just prob loneliness and fatigue/peers trying to fit in with people. But i was always off/out of it. And I 
never really found my place with anyone, So like I have no close friends just like two or three. I used to have more. Maybe I pushed them away sort of. I rejected a lot of people who hurt me. Just seeing them could trigger a breakdown for me for some of these people I knew. I guess I cant make sense of it. Maybe it was poltergeists, evil, bewitchment, the mantauk project. who the hell knows. But I can’t explain the paranormal bs. The premonitions, dreaming of the future. Seeing objects fly across the room as if someone or spirit trying to get my attention. Cant explain when I sat on a bench high on marijauna and i looked at a car moving, then time stood still, and I watched the same scene again as If it happened twice. Can’t explain the times I thought I had seen things appear, disappear, in random places, cant explain when people said random things I was thinking/why or in High school when I went off my meds and it felt the world was gaslighting me/that I was literally in a waking dream. That I couldnt w
ake up from…nothing too frightening, of course the scariest stuff I block out–like the tactile nightmares of vampires, the werewolf double agents, all the weird guys I ended up sleeping with that later died or disappeared. Who made strange requests. Why I live next to the Masons Headquarters the NSA and etc. and why I think the way I do. When my computer randomly made a spinning dot appear, and all the pages appeared about _NAME_ and turning the lights out or whatever in 2016 why I think I saw _NAME_ Rich murdered on the news in the local HMART and if it was him or someone else who tried to walk into the WH or was walking by the WH and why it no longer fits that same narrative. Why I think the banks targeted me or why _NAME_ was asking me for my dad’s bank statements to prove the credit card companies were falsifying my statements and not posting my payments to the capital one cards. Why my Vanguard stocks/shares were randomly sold while my account access blocked from me. Why all my accounts got hacked 
by data breaches and why I got a settlement from wells fargo for $500 for identity theft and now have two more claims… These are things I haven’t forgotten Should I lie to myself to pretend I have false memories. Like when I was 17 and thought a Mass Pandemic would be used by the evil elite scientists i called the architects of the NWO to create a prison surveillance state where we would be barcoded and chipped. I literally thought i made up the word RFID for a dystopian novel I wrote. I mean, does it matter? That I dream about things before they happen. I dreamed about the entire political spectrum and that whoever wins it will be too late because of a weakened military, but I hope I am wrong. The targets etc. could be different could be predictive programming or some kind of psiop. Not sure. But everything people say I am crazy about eventually comes true anyways. And people eventually realize I know what I am talking about. By then its too late. Im medicated, labeled, strapped down, ignored, and coerce
d to take pills to cover it up. Story of my life basically. My mother was the same way. Im just like her. In the end, they did destroy everyone she loved over 911 and the secret she knew with the FBI interrogation. I dont even know sometimes what it all means, that she can replace memories or disconnects under stressful situations where it never happened. The truth is more painful than the lie. Jagged little pills."

176098261,"It has me thinking about that night, and in general that period of my life. There was never any danger of me dying that night, but I didn’t know that. I thought it would be lethal, and I finally was completely fed up after 5 years of nonstop depression and SI; I was ready to die, at 20 years old. I’d spent five years dealing with depression and SI, as well as psychotic symptoms, suffering in silence. It started when I was a minor, and I knew my dad would not allow me to take meds; he would’ve told me to snap out of it. When I finally did start taking meds he hated it. Anyway, all I did the night of Jan 15, 2000 was take a box of Unisom and a glass of tequila. I’d heard of people killing themselves with sleeping pills and liquor, didn’t realize those were done with prescription sleeping pills. I just slept for 12 solid hours, woke up briefly, then slept another 4 hours. But yeah, just thinking and ruminating over these things today and yesterday. Thank you for reading."

Until then I’ll just be trying to get in the habit of walking. I feel better when I do something too. I’m glad you made a friend. There’s a gal at group that is trying to be friends with me but she’s sort of weird so I don’t know.

176098318,"Anxiety disorders generally have the lowest heritability coefficients, even lower than depression, and bipolar and SZ have the highest heritability coefficients, with bipolar slightly higher than SZ. SZ heritability is in the .80-.85 range IIRC, and bipolar in the .85-.90 range."

176098325,"Love requires honesty. You might want to talk in therapy about getting over your aversion to masturbating. Just because you have sexual urges doesn’t mean you’ll find a partner. The best thing is to learn to take care of your urges on your own, so you don’t treat a potential partner as just a vessel to have sex with. All people have their own wants and needs in life, and you have to be able to respect your partner’s wants and needs. It kind of sounds like you’re just looking for an alive sex doll, and women generally don’t want that kind of relationship."

Started talking to family members to distract myself but it’s hard. I feel pretty cornered. Some of it has to do with pressure from the quarantine I guess.

174367021,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Efficacy of cariprazine on negative symptoms in patients with acute schizophrenia: A post hoc analysis of pooled data. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research, 2019 02 Although currently approved antipsychotics exert efficacy on positive symptoms of schizophrenia, treatments for negative symptoms remain a major unmet need. Post hoc analyses were used to investigate the possible efficacy of cariprazine in patients with moderate/severe negative symptoms of schizophrenia and no predominance of positive symptoms. Data were pooled from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled cariprazine studies in patients with acute schizophrenia (NCT_PHONE_NO_, NCT01104766). Analyses included data from a subset of patients with a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factor score for negative symptoms (PANSS-FSNS) ?24, PANSS factor score for positive symptoms (PANSS-FSPS) ?19, and scores of ?4 on ?2 o
f 3 PANSS items (blunted affect [N1], passive/apathetic social withdrawal [N4], lack of spontaneity/flow of conversation [N6]). Changes from baseline to week 6 in PANSS-FSNS were evaluated in the following treatment groups: placebo (n?=?79), cariprazine 1.5-3 (n?=?94) and 4.5-6?mg/d (n?=?66), risperidone 4?mg/d (n?=?34), or aripiprazole 10?mg/d (n?=?44). Significant differences were observed versus placebo for cariprazine (1.5-3?mg/d, P?=?.0179; 4.5-6?mg/d, P?=?.0002) and risperidone (P?=?.0149), but not aripiprazole (P?=?.3265), and versus aripiprazole for cariprazine 4.5-6?mg/d (P?=?.0197). After adjusting for positive symptom changes, differences versus placebo remained statistically significant for cariprazine (1.5-3?mg/d, P?=?.0322; 4.5-6?mg/d, P?=?.0038) but not for risperidone (P?=?.2204). PANSS-FSNS response (?20% reduction from baseline) rates were significantly higher with cariprazine (1.5-3?mg/d?=?54.3%, P?=?.0194; 4.5-6?mg/d?=?69.7%, P?=?.0001) than placebo (35.4%).

176098385,"I am not sz either, but 32 years ago, when I was briefly psychotic it seemed to me that the world and I were a product of narration - a story. I have since found quite a lot of philosophy that supports this assertion. Eastern thought, the mentioning of which may be banned here, so only in passing. _NAME_, who says that the physical world is our explanation of our sensations. _PERSON_ who based his theory of relativity (and the “Speed of light speed limit”) on the theory of _PERSON_ (and _PERSON_). It has always seem fortuitous (or quite preposterously arrogant!) to me to assume or argue that a creature of our insignificance should be able to sense the fastest thing in the universe. Once you know where _PERSON_ got this theory from (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_) a much more humble explanation as to why why no thing goes faster than light - because “things” are our explanations of our experience, and the fastest sensation we have is light. _NAME_, a scientist who understood _PERSON_ joked that the c
laim that nothing goes faster than the speed of light is like the claim that there are no fish smaller than the holes in the net you are using to catch them. Relatedly _PERSON_ agues that there are no “fundamental particles” any more than there are “fundamental millimetres,” since particles are akin to our units of spatial measurement. "" It from Bit"" by _NAME_ is similar. _NAME_, a materialist claims that the self is a theoretical entity (like a “centre of gravity”) like those of the other theorists above, but he believes in the reality of physical material. It seems to me that the self is the first, most certain of things. If there is no self, then there are no things either, and everything, every thing, is like a “centre of gravity,” a theoretical and therefore, to an extent, fictional entity."

When things are left undone but I don’t feel a desire to do them, that’s a funk IMO. When I’m literally unable to get up and do things that I have a desire to do, those are negatives. It also has to go into how I’m processing pleasure as well. Anhidonia is considered a negative, when I’m having trouble deriving pleasure from every day tasks or fun activities, it count it as negative. If I’m having the time of my life playing a video game for example, and I’m just letting things pile up, I consider that a funk. I tool I use is actually writing down and having a set schedule for my ADL’s. Time frames and activity outlines. The structure helped me. Wishing you some reprieve! Be safe tuna buddy!"

176098410,"No, it’s bad to smoke and vape, period. We already know the dangers of smoking, so no need to get into that. Thing is that people haven’t been vaping for long enough for us to see any long term dangers. People always say that it’s safer than smoking, but that’s just an assumption made on the grounds of it seeming like it should be safer than smoking. Like yeah, it’s clearly better in the short term, but when you think about it, you’re literally inhaling mystery juice (because I’d be willing to bet that not a single person who vapes heavily has read and looked up any of their juice’s ingredients). It just sounds like it’s a good way to end up with infections and respiratory illnesses, like bronchitis and pneumonia. And even if it’s proven to be safer than smoking at some point, that doesn’t mean it’s safe. It’s like weight. Just because having a BMI of 50 is safer than having a BMI of 5 doesn’t mean that having a BMI of 50 safe. We just don’t know, and anyone who vapes 
recreationally (i.e. not as a step down from smoking) is just a guinea pig. It’s like those commercials that come on saying you may be entitled to financial compensation for taking some experimental drug that resulted in both of your legs being amputated. Receiving money is nice and all, but I’d rather have the bottom fu cking half of my body, thanks. tldr: Just because vaping is possibly safer than smoking doesn’t mean it’s safe.

I think there is something wrong with the way I think and all the good behaviour in the world wont stop me from not being able to socialize properly, being a bit weird and feeling overwhelmed for no reason at all on a regular basis. I just have to get used to the fact that if I don’t want to have my mental health to become worse I will just have to take meds my whole life and just get on with things the best I can.

search has seeks to find an effect of a chemical substance that can induces a symptom , to be appeared as a similar to a symptom of sz -nothing more, and they take this as an evidence to creation the sz condition or its symptoms all !

no casual relationship (root origin) with the anatomical factors,genetic,chemical ,functional ,immunologic …etc In simple words, there is no existential / functional relationship between the Biological factors and the symptoms of sz To explain the main event,the hallucinations entity(s) seems as a machine that produces vocal thoughts through out waking hours without self stopping,the broadcasting of the spoken thoughts is like waves of the sea, wave after wave ,clam down or active at time,but it does not stop broadcasting the acoustic thoughts or relay (repetition) during the wakefulness period ,And Transformation all forms of negative feeling about oneself and others,sacred personalities,religious beliefs,personal and social relationship,the society,customs and traditions,historical and contemporary events,the life and beyond, global and local phenomena,daliy life events,memories of past events related to the person’s biography"

176098481,I don’t hate. I just feel disgust and nausea upon seeing my father or upon hearing him on the phone. I literally wanna throw up
176098482,I know they work. I was hooked on them in hospital.
176098483,_AT_MENTION_ I think you need to speak candidly with your pdoc about your resentment and anger and your thoughts of violent intent. Do you have a therapist? They can help you develop better coping strategies to manage your anger.
176098484,Well I take my meds. I’m still far from a normie in how I feel and function though.

174367054,"I don’t wish anything bad for you, I’d love every schizophrenic on earth to make a full recovery and live happily ever after and healthy. I’m just a little cynical when people claim a full recovery. I guess it’s possible but I’ve seen too many people’s schizophrenia, “cured” or “fully recovered” but down the road, even the best of them relapse. But hey, you just got twenty people happy for you and just one negative reply (me). Who ya going to believe?"
176098488,I read about that but I can’t articulate it because I’ve forgotten most of it. But in basic terms: if you do something over and over regularly your brain will make a new neural path and turn it into the new normal.
176098489,For me its progressively getting worse. Don’t know if its mental disease or some kind of dementia etc.
176098490,"Yes. I would really like to know also, because I’ve never escaped them."

176098495,OMG. This is SUCH a hard thing to do. Lifestyle changes are the worst. But squirrel master is right. Risperdone was my first med too and I put in 70 pounds in three and a half years. Then I took all of the weight off thru healthy eating and plenty of exercise. It was REALLY hard tho. But I wanted it that bad. GL

176098507,Why does this upset you? Just let people like what they like. They didn’t choose it. Judging men for their lack of interest in someone isn’t any better than judging women for it.
176098508,Agreed to go go for a short walk to see something Christmassy with my granddaughter and gt granddaughter. The spirit was willing but my back wasn’t up to it. I did walk a little further than I have for quite a long time though.
174367053,I think I’d take prison for the short term if it cured my Schizophrenia. Prison is for a set length of time. Schizophrenia is the gift that keeps on giving. I dunno about Life in prison though. Thats a bit much for an exchange.

174367071,Yes. It took a lot. I’m depressed and hear voices everyday.
176098519,"See I wasn’t sure about the rules, I should read them. Because I’ve had a similar past, and there was one time I’ve smoked THC and not had psychosis, since my diagnosis. I had something else in my system. I’ve wondered since if there was possibly something there worth researching for mental health purposes - an ingredient. Heck I hope this doesn’t get me banned, but it begins with C, ends with E and is sniffed. That night, I had no symptoms at all. So yeah, it got me thinking why - my answer pointed towards “that”. I should add tho, if I’m going to mention this subject, that night, “that” was extremely strong. Who knows, maybe somebody in the medical trade might read this and it could open a research door. Maybe that’s a justification for leaving this comment, I dunno… and no, I’m not saying people run out and do things they shouldn’t. I’m just speaking from my own experiences… and if this isn’t an acceptable comment for this forum, please remove it."

It’s funny but when I hear voices, what they say is so clear but when the voices pass and end then I can’t recall exactly what they say - its very vague.

When I got home, I laid down on the couch for a few minutes and as I was gazing at the ceiling, the ceiling suddenly disappeared and turned into a swirling Vortex of clouds. From inside this Cloud tunnel I heard the voice of God say, I want you to teach. A psychiatrist would term this a psychotic break from reality. I’m not sure what to believe, perhaps psychosis is how God communicates through us. I really don’t know"

176098567,I have two types of voices. First one is whispers. I can hear someone talking but it’s very faint occasionally il hear my name. They seem to be activated every time I consciously want to listen for silence or enjoy silence theylll start then. They also get triggered times I have an emotional reaction to something usually on tv. Other than that they don’t bother me and go when I get distracted. They happen every time I’m watching tv or relaxing at night The other ones are more persistent their triggered by being overwhelmed at work or stress. Their still faint but their justlouder than my whispers. They seem to go when I remove whatever’s stressing me out. I can tell what their saying sometimes just by the way they react to my thoughts. I can’t ignore the stress voices really but the whispers are easy to ignore.

174367080,"Hope you can kick the habit. Generally speaking , it is not good for schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. Do your best, I believe a large part of my recovery(?) is due to getting rid of marijuana use, and I am someone who rarely hears auditory hallucinations and visual ones rarely sees and then even negative symptoms aren’t always an issue either.

176098624,"I have made small amounts of money selling images of art on Etsy, selling music tracks on cdbaby and Bandcamp, selling apps on Google Play and Amazon and selling some used items on Craigslist and eBay. I would say eBay and Craigslist are the most profitable for the amount of time invested. Apps are a little hard to make and need a lot of marketing but there are systems like Sketchware, Appy Pie etc that make it a lot easier to program. If I was strong enough I would probably go back to delivering groceries locally to the elderly since I usually got good tips. Alternatively there are human services agencies that take care of developmentally disabled people that are always looking for drivers and assistants."
176098625,"I’ve been off an anti-psychotic for over two and a half months. Recently I noticed some internal dialogue that could be possible symptoms. I first noticed that I “heard” words that I used to hear before medicated. Words like “hole” and “jeans” would pop into my head. Before I had elaborate delusions when that occurred. For example, I thought when I heard the word “hole” it was the secret service noticing there was a hole in my protection and working to amend the situation. However, now, I hear the words and don’t attach meaning to it. The past few weeks I have been noticing that when I’m around people (sometimes) I think that I am following a subtext conversation that is going on below the surface. The most of the time it’s me thinking that I can tell when they’re thinking I’m crazy (like they look at me and I think “crazy” which I think is their thought) but other times I think I said, “No” to an conversation that was going on below the surface. It’s hard to e
xplain and does not happen with everyone I’m around nor does it seem to happen over the phone, just in person and usually in higher stress situations (like at work with the new clinicians, my boss or at my sister’s birthday party last week). I was starting to think it was not a big deal and was finding the information helpful until yesterday when one of my best friends was concerned. So I am trying to monitor closely and figure things out. I’m not sure what my options are. I’m going to try reality testing with a friend I trust (basically ask him if what I think he’s thinking is what he’s thinking) but I’m not sure that will work because I might not trust his response and think that he’s hiding something from me (plus thoughts are so personal that oftentimes people would want to admit to having them). I’m also maybe going to try to just hold it a part, as a symptom, as long as I can still go about my every day and concentrate. The other option that I thought of was go back on medication, but 
I really don’t want to do that. One reason is because of how I felt on the med but also because I read a research article that said long-term people do best off anti-psychotics. I’d really appreciate other people’s opinion and personal experience on the matter. This has been a high stress time for me – first with interviewing for an internship and then having new clinicians at work. Plus I am trying to branch out with online dating and going to my sister’s birthday party took a lot of work. Also, I got into an intense conversation with a friend about two exes of mine . . ."

174367096,"I recently went back on my meds willingly and voluntarily. For me, it wasn’t that bad. It was a personal choice. I think I went a few months off without taking anything except my Cymbalta – I think. I just ended up drinking like 6 energy drinks every damn day. My mom thinks I am weird off meds and when I drink those energy drinks. I start talking about conspiracy theories and have weird thoughts. I’m doing better now. I didn’t really suffer. It should be a personal choice like in my case. I never got into any trouble or anything. I felt in control and in touch of reality. I think I’m smarter and know more about reality than most people including the doctors who deny all my beliefs and theories on reality and my trauma (that I think happened and was real – at least at the time and to me). For example, I have memories (past life) of being in the Illuminati. Can’t really say I enjoyed it or care about it. I’m trying to be a good person and a Christian. I need to read the bible. Not rea
lly interested in church or the community. I have the belief system and that’s that. Anyways, I do have fear and paranoia about certain things but it’s pretty much gone. I’m a good person and a patriot. My biggest problem is time jumping or going to parallel universes when sleeping or when I die and then coming back alive through consciousness transfer or whatever ???????? it’s called. It’s been going on like this for billions of years or lifetimes. (I know you don’t care but I do). I don’t think my schizophrenia is typical and it might be manageable or partially recovered after 8 years of hell, ptsd, and dissociation (DP/DR). I had years of meds and therapy and time. I actually love my medication (Vraylar). I would only take Vraylar. And I’m glad I have it. I have little to no side effects and my schizophrenic symptoms are minor and manageable. I just am a bum or something. But I want more and I want to get better. I lost all respect for doctors after they keep denying a PTSD diagnosis and th
ey won’t give my adderall/ADHD meds despite the obvious struggle and issues. They won’t even let me try it. I’ve already been a lab rat and a guinea pig, so what’s another med going to do? I cannot recommend or not recommend you stopping your meds. Like I said, I have an atypical case (even my mom admits and my family thinks I’m high functioning and have potential). I don’t have hallucinations even off meds. But if you’re like the standard schizophrenic, you probably need it. There’s a lot of fear factor here on this forum about quitting meds and dying or whatever, but I’m good. Remember this is a schizophrenic forum."

There are many times where upon him trying to be stern and not give into my cravings I have become very upset with him. In his words he was “tired of playing the bad guy all the time”. In addition, he feels helpless when my illness acts up and I am down. “Taking care of me” ie bringing me comfort food and whatnot makes him feel like he is doing something and helping me. I acknowledged that I have treated him unfairly in the past and we have talked about me needing to find healthier coping mechanisms for things such as frustration other than taking it out on him and also when I am depressed not relying on junk to cheer me up.

Voices started talking to me like insults saying I am the stupidiest, a cheater, a son of a b!tch, etc at age 14. Here you can’t see a psychiatrist without having an emergency situation or without a general Dr note, I think bcz health care is free. I hide my symptoms from everybody except my family Dr. He ignored my symptoms and said its stress. Symptoms worsened and I started abusing alcohol to stop the voices. Voices got religious at age 17, saying I am God. At 20 y.o. voices told me to kill myself to prove that I am God so I did. Emergency Drs said I nearly died from liver failure after swallowing a whole Tylenol bottle. They said I would be dead if I came late to the emergency. I vomitted for 2hrs.

I know I’m in a much better situation than you are having to deal with. I hope you figure out a way to stay sheltered, have food and all your basic needs while you wait for their response. I’ll be posting my situation here if it helps you in anyway. I’m filing in California. I hear the process was a breeze for some and long drawn out for others. It really depends on the judge which I hear from someone who works on approving SSI SSDI is a huge factor in the process. Find assistance anywhere possible. In California I would also qualify for food stamps. And there are services that aid in utility bills. Just look everywhere you can for help."

It sounds like you’ve been around the block a few times so you’ve probably tried it all but just in case… Getting those positive symptoms and paranoia under control would go along way to making your situation more solvable I would think.

My question is that is the injection palliperidone palmitate the same as palliperidone. Is it safe that palliperidone has a hydroxyl group -OH at the end of it like is it an alcohol? If it is an alcohol how Am I going to drive with it? also is invega sustenna going to be hydrolized into the body slowly and transform to palliperidone tablet molecule?

176098787,"Pornography is basically encouraging people to disrespect authority. Those who believe in the natural order of the world, numbers, believe in a beginning with no end, do not tend to watch pornography, on the other hand, those who believe that everything is equal and unjust watch it to give their ego a boost to confront the corruption. The fears that corruption is catching are largely unfounded in my opinion, however corruption is oppressive. That’s where masturbation comes in. The boost of energy to dissolve the corruption in pleasure is very powerful. Unfortunately this can also be damaging as a person can become too out of synch with reality, which really isn’t as corrupt as porn makes out. I am told porn has come a long way, moving more towards erotica with better health and safety and less exploitation in the industry. Deciding just what is erotica and what is porn has always been a sticking point for me as I have struggled with the inherent paradox of equal but not equal. Thank you."

And I finally got an appointment to see a pdoc but it’s not till Feb 10th. It’s been 7 months since I’ve had a psychiatric evaluation and about a year since I’ve had labs. I’m used to getting labs every 4 months or so. The mental health system in this county is flawed. Or perhaps I’m not a squeaky enough wheel to get any attention. I just sort of cringe at the thought of people worse off than me trying to navigate their way through this system with no support. It makes me worry for them. And there’s a huge homeless population here too, I worry for them too. Like do they have access to the mental health services they need? I’m guessing not. It’s scary. This is such a rich area, you would think they could do better in terms of social services. And that’s just the tip of the ice berg of what’s on my mind. I am just v
ery anxious today. Thankfully I don’t have to function at all."

176098874,"They did measure the PANSS negative subscale separately, and there was improvement in the medication group vs placebo. But I don’t know how meaningful this change really is. 3.6 points is better than 1.6 but is it life altering? IDK, maybe? I don’t know how this compares to other medications. _USER_ID_: I still don’t know but apparently MIN-101 had a similar result on the negative subscale of the PANSS, around 3.5 points. Different patient profile though, acute exacerbation vs chronically ill but stable. Also I don’t know the effect size. Secondary efficacy assessments that compared SEP-363856 versus placebo support the findings of the primary endpoint including change from baseline to Week Four in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score (-1.0 vs. -0.5; p<0.001), PANSS positive subscale score (-5.5 vs. -3.9; p=0.019), PANSS negative subscale score (-3.1 vs. -1.6; p=0.008) , PANSS general psychopathology subscale score (-9.0 vs. -4.7; p<0.001)."

174367144,"I had voices for a while before the psychotic break. It consisted of me seeing and hearing things more often and to a point my memory was gone and visual perception turned into a sharpened images. I thought everyone knew everything about me and that I had special powers because of the secret world of voices and I was able to know what wasn’t seen. I watched the NASA channel on satellite TV and I understood every bit that I started seeing the construction of rockets in front of me. I thought I was a genius and then the voices confirmed that. Then the day I got help I lost total insight, my pdoc asked me if I watched TV, and I started seeing a TV in the corner of the office, also heard a lady telling me my mom was the cause of all my problems, later on that night before my therapist, my aunt was baking Christmas cookies and I forgot how to put sugar in a mixture.

176098884,"The following strategy has been mentioned in this thread: do things 5 minutes at a time when feeling like you can’t do anything. I often feel so overwhelmed (subconsciously) that I’m not able to even look at the task. Let alone break it up into the simple steps or see these steps at all. Any suggestion for that? Also, when I’m not overwhelmed this extremely and the idea of just doing it for 5 mins would be helpful, I just feel like oh if it’s gonna be that sort then I can put it off for some minutes. And then for a few more minutes and so on and so on… How do you counter this logic? I guess the only real way I’ve managed to counter it so far, it requires my feeling invested in wanting to have my life great again (oh the elusive dopamine). But maybe there are other ways to counter it, I’d like to hear from anyone if any of you are up for it."

176098920,I am thinking about being single by choice. Because the person I love the most my x in sa won’t take me back. I left him to become vegan and give my horse a better paddock. He is the love of my life. All others can’t compare not even ecstatic sex that was a shallow love. I can love other people and enjoy other people’s company but he is the one and he won’t take me back and I can’t believe I left a perfect home and family. I went on a couple dates with a guy but I only want to be friends with him and nothing else . I don’t want to have sex but if I don’t have sex he will stop hanging out. I just want a friend to hang out with once a week or so while I’m living here. If I can’t have my x in sa I might be single the rest of my life or date just for company even though I love someone else. Someone I know has been single over twenty years and plans on staying single. Her man left her and she was done after that. Is it fair on the man I date if I’m inlove with someone else I guess it
s ok if I tell him that. I told the man I met that I love my x in sa and that i don’t feel like having sex right now. He wants to have sex and I have always given myself to easily . Sometimes rape sometimes just yeeaaa ok but not enjoyable. I want to go walking with him once a week but nothing else and if my x in sa would have me back I would be there in a heartbeat. He is the person I love most in the world.thats huge. I had better sex with someone else though. I want to marry my x in sa. I might be single the rest of my life. If I see other people it will not be as deep and I will not love them nearly as much. I had to be true to myself and not even let my favourite person stop me from being the person I want to be n he doesn’t believe in climate change and kills mice on glue traps. Every day I regret leaving. Every day I miss him.and the girls and country life. Every day I love him and the girls. I don’t want to be on a dating site when I love my x in sa and only want him. I might hang out with a m
an but I only want to be friends. He is nice to hang out with but I miss my family in sa. Maybe I should be single and look for a friend. See what happens. My grandma died knowing the love of her life was someone she didn’t get. She had boyfriends after him but she’s never loved them as deeply. I think that will be me too if I don’t get him back I will die knowing he is the love of my life and that we were not together but I will believe we will be together again after death. I have faith we will be together again.

176098931,I take klonopin since 11 years ago now. I’ve been on as high as 1.5 mg although now my anxiety is better I only need a small daily dose of klonopin. Like I break the .5 pill into a small piece. Like probably on average I take .1 mg of klonopin per day. A script will last me a handful of months. I never built a tolerance or dependence and my dose has gone down over the years. Simply put klonopin is a great medicine for me. I get anxious if I don’t take my small piece of clonazepam pill tho. I believe it causes addiction and issues for some people but not for everyone and I know some providers won’t prescribe it but fortunately my aprn does and my last pdoc did too. I hear you everhopeful but for me it really is a lifesaver for me even at this tiny dose

176098937,Self diagnosis- 1 month. When I could tell the voices were actually in my head it was obvious I had my Uncle’s disease although I never definitely figured out why. Doctor diagnosis- 1 year 2 months later. I hid it for a long time trying to keep a normal profile in society but couldn’t live with the voices forever as I became a bad insomniac and an incompetent student and worker. Eventually I told the medical community what was up. The first revelation was at the ER where they gave me a pill script and told me to go home. The official diagnosis was toward the end of that year when I talked to a doctor face to face about it. I didn’t say much at the time as revealing what the voices said was damning to me. After he asked what they said the voices spoke up and I made a face and he guessed the general content of things. I was put on a diet to check for another cause and came back as psychotic as ever. Then the diagnosis was made. Merry Christmas you have schizophrenia.

174367168,"New clues into the genetic origins of schizophrenia The first genetic analysis of schizophrenia in an ancestral African population, the South African Xhosa, appears in the Jan. 31 issue of the journal Science . An international group of scientists conducted the research, including investigators from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and New York State Psychiatric Institute, as well as the University of Cape Town and the University of Washington. The study was carried out in the Xhosa population because Africa is the birthplace of all humans, yet ancestral African populations have rarely been the focus of genetics research. (There is no evidence that the Xhosa have an unusually high risk of schizophrenia). The researchers analyzed blood samples collected from 909 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and 917 controls living in South Africa. Their study revealed that participants with schizophrenia are significantly more likely to carry rare, damaging genetic mutations compared t
o participants without schizophrenia. These rare mutations were also more likely to affect brain and synaptic function. Synapses coordinate the communication between brain nerve cells called neurons; the organization and firing of neuronal synapses are ultimately responsible for learning, memory, and brain function."

Well the invega gave me high prolactin and I had little to no ejaculated fluid. On the Invega and also Vraylar I was just able to ejaculate about as much fluid as I used to so i think adding the Vraylar lowered my prolactin. I knew abilify could lower prolactin but since Vraylar is similar to abilify I think it did the same thing.

I’d do it again, because the alternative was worse, but I still feel like shít. Once I manage to fall asleep, I stay asleep, but I dread actually shutting everything off and laying down because then I can’t help but think about my actions and their potentially negative consequences. Like I don’t even know if this person has anyone to talk to anymore. I’m afraid that this person might make an attempt on their life, and there’s no way for me to do anything to prevent it. I keep telling myself that I did what I had to do, that if they didn’t want to risk this then they should’ve changed their behavior, that any further action taken by this person isn’t my fault, but that’s not wor
king, and it’ll never work, because the fact of the matter is that I feel responsible for anything bad that might happen to this person from here on out. Like seriously, what if this person kills themselves? Then what? What happens to anyone who may care about them? It’s my fault. I do want to live my life, but will this always be in the background? Should it always be in the background? People always say to be kind to yourself and shít, but I feel like that’s making it worse. Like, “Sardonic, you’re such a loving person.

Sodium valproate is the best thing I’ve had so far as it is leading to me being born again, in a non-religious sense, and this is helping me to focus on the present rather than to carry the burdens of my past around, though I have to admit that sometimes I pine for the nostalgia.

Well today I don’t have to get anything from the store, no take out, bills are paid and no work. And I am STILL anxious to go outside. I just wanted to go outside to spend some time on the new longboard I got and immediately I decided I didn’t want to go outside because the neighbors would see me. I was so excited to learn longboard and now that I have it I’m too scared to go practice.

176099241,"There is a lot of info online you can access if you try to go it on your own. Some of it is conflicting and you need to find out what works for you. If you then see your pdoc regularly, they might adjust your medication down if you are feeling better. _PERSON_ is good for inflammation and auto-immune problems, and there is at least some evidence (I think ) that sza is related to those."

176099245,Love… addicted to the idea of love…
176099246,I have lots of favourites. I’m feeling good vibes about _NAME_ who was in _PERSON_ family and about _NAME_ hunt. Bad vibes from most actresses and I have a belief _NAME_ was malicious to me with her friends and ruined me as she planned to ruin me and kindof bully me and I don’t like her and avoid her as I don’t want people like her in my life. Also bad vibes from _NAME_ and _NAME_ and possibly evening the charming _NAME_ barrymore. I can’t watch some tv because some tv people give off bad vibes. _NAME_ is great. I love so many actors but this moment in time those two chicks seem nice.
176099247,I’m sorry you had to go through that. Can I ask how long it took for the meds to work to bring you out of it?
176099248,The shakes were really terrible. I couldn’t hold a glass of water.

176099251,Anxiety is shared by all humans. Do you mean a diagnosable anxiety disorder? I think with all disorders it is over and under diagnosed. People go undiagnosed that definitely have it and others get misdiagnosed.

I just have no drive to do anything. I wish I could get over this. I clean when I can and I keep up with my hygiene, but I am just not motivated to do anything else. I don’t know if its because I am on disability and have gotten lazy because of it, or maybe its the medication I am on, or maybe its the disorder."
176099254,What were your symptoms? Do you have insomnia?
176099255,"Yes, I know you post this stuff all the time. It’s pretty much all you post. It sounds delusional. I feel badly for you because you are missing out on a quality life by allowing your delusions to rule you like this. I hope for better for you."

They are slowly meeting my alters and so far they’ve even befriended a couple!! And I just work for a temp agency right now but it works for us and helps us pay some bills. A lot of times we help each other out on jobs. Especially if one of us gets overwhelmed.
176099285,I think I got it from brain trauma as a child. I stopped breathing as a baby and lacked oxygen from it. I started hearing many voices at 8 years old and have never been normal really. I’ve had these problems for years. I’m so freaking tired.
176099286,Yes I do the bloodwork. I have been on it for around a year and still get super nauseated every time. I don’t see him til next month but I’ll be okay til then. Sometimes I take a gravol at night.

174367255,No need to take it daily. Its not like a daily to use pill. If you are planning to take it daily then DMG is best as it not have that strong effect like TMG. Anyway I suggest to try TMG at first as DMG not bring noticeable effect though it working in the background.

Okay, the most distressing side effect that affected me and wanted to change meds was Erectile Dysfunction. You won’t believe how strong I was before 2017 but after 2 years horrible sexual/libido problems. That’s why they put me on Clozapine. Doctor told that he will try olanzapine and iloperidone too."
176099294,"I used to experience synchronicities with volcanoes. So when I had a very emotional experience, I noticed a volcanic erruption on the news enough times for me to think… Wow… The world is connected somehow… But after psychosis I’ve changed… Of course the synchronities were through the roof during psychosis but that’s the illness. And then now I sometimes get addicted to looking for synchronities so I try to cut it out all together, the search, because it just becomes exhaustive and I don’t know if it is meaningful. Ofcourse on this forum this idea is seen as a delusion. But out in the real world there are non psychotic people who believe in these things. I don’t know if I do believe in meaningful coincidences. It is easily to fall into the trap of ‘synchronicity’ addiction though so I try to not make it important in my life. As much as possible. I try to cut it out, the search for ‘synchronicities’ for that very reason. I don’t want it to interfere negatively with my life."
176099295,Often I feel like when things happen and I’m losing my grip that I am bombed back to the stone age. How true for others too! But its sad and never really lasts very long.

I have this voice telling me that he is going to torture me and he put me through so much and did not care how they treated me and flashing pictures of people and celebrities I did not know why. I don’t know why this cartoon character did this I wish he would stop. The girl who does this to me for a day was nice and civil to me then got upset at me again. I want these people to leave me alone. What they are doing is not right. How can I get them arrested? Even though I don’t want anything to do with them.

176099366,When I was 16 I became pregnant. My mother scheduled an abortion for me at a doctor’s office. I had to take a bus to go to the appointment by myself. I was so upset. The stress of the situation brought on my first psychotic episode. When the doctor started the abortion and turned on the machine I freaked out and told them I changed my mind. They tried to explain to me that it was too late to change my mind as the procedure had been started the night before with the dilation of my cervix and I would lose the pregnancy and need the surgery no matter what. I freaked out and kicked the doctor. He poked my uterus an ruptured it causing a lot of blood loss. I looked down and saw blood but in my psychosis I saw blood everywhere. The suction machine was overflowing and the nurse was covered in blood. I even saw blood on the walls. I continued to kick and fight until I passed out. The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with my mother staring at me. The doctor had to call an ambulance and ru
sh me to the hospital to complete the surgery and stop the bleeding from the rupture.

I tell them, “I’m sure you’ve noticed how strange I am, and how fearful I am about little things. I hear voices that try to convince me to kill myself, and point out every single flaw I have.

I normally have cbd oil that has trace amounts of thc in it, like most cbd oils, but I noticed they made me a bit sad, like a dark cloud above me. I decided to try pure 100% cbd with all the thc taken out, and let me say, I feel wonderful, clear headed and happy. I suggest anyone who has tried cbd oil and had a bad experience to try pure cbd oil. I’m not high one bit but my contrast and brightness of vision has improved. I take antipsychotics so I don’t know how it effects schizophrenia, but I’m in a bright mood. Even trace amounts of thc depress me apparently, but the cbd is all good. I paid £20 for 60 capsules. I don’t know why the doctors don’t prescribe pure thc free cbd. It’s like just about all cbd products contain bits of thc, I don’t like thc…in any amounts. So if any uk doctors on here read this, then think about prescribing pure cbd to your patients for any reason. My ho

I tried to tell them it’s what’s annoying them, but they refused to believe they’re addicted, just like I would have refused to believe it before treatment. Before treatment, something snapped inside about video games. I suddenly viewed them as a waste of time. I didn’t think I was addicted, but I up and decided that all my years of gaming was a waste of time. Before that snap was a snap about daydreaming that was exactly the same, I decided video games were a waste of time, then I stopped daydreaming. I haven’t completely stopped gaming yet… But, I wish I could. Unfortunately, because everyone else is gaming, and my old school friends are unreachable from COVID19, gaming’s all I can do.

176099568,"I don’t expect anyone to sympathize or believe me, but I was thinking today my biggest hurdle in recovering is my DP/DR and paranoid about my thoughts and my online posts and beliefs. I have a fear of being watched and messed with obviously. I was 22 when I was tortured. I guess because there is no evidence or marks, no one believes me. I assume people think I’m either delusional or making things up, but I’m not. There are plenty of cases of people like me that were subjected to MK-Ultra type trauma at universities and hospitals. Mine happened at UC Berkeley back in 2011. I don’t like talking about it over fear. It’s hard to grasp why this happened to me like if it was random or not. I’m sure Berkeley has big pockets and gets money for these kind of things. Most institutions do. Obviously, I’m on my own unless government changes or _PERSON_ decides to give victims like me money for being tortured and experimented on. Even for financial aid and social security, I’m hesitant about che
cking the ""were you ever tortured’ box. I do have fear. It’s so hard to accept that government has these technologies (some say the Cabal or aliens). Personally, I think it’s a combination of all three things. I’m actually pretty smart and I notice things despite my disability. My biggest disability is not my lack of motivation, but my DP/DR which is exacerbated by caffeine. Hygiene is a second. My intelligence has returned somewhat although diminished. It’s hard to cope when my IQ was 130ish and now it’s 120ish – approximately. I still have my old dreams and desires. If I struggled with a 130ish IQ to finish school, how can I even finish now with more issues and disability? For what it’s worth: I believe and know I was in Mk-Ultra Monarch Programming (Satanic Ritual Abuse Victim); Montauk Project; Secret Space Program; and a Super Soldier. I’ve lived multiple realities and lives. I’ve experienced time travel and resurrection/reincarnation. I believe I have a photographic memory of past l
ives. I think and know this goes all the way up to the Pentagon and White House and even to the President(s). It’s scary. My story is similar or exactly like _PERSON_. In a distant past life, _PERSON_ turned into a Reptilian in front of me in some building. I wouldn’t be surprised if _NAME_ had a role. I mean she is really evil. I usually avoid mentioning names and talking about these sort of things. It seemed to have happened in 2011 when he was president. I’m sure a lot of things like this happen but I don’t know why. I don’t think it’s fair at all. I don’t know who to blame. I have a strong mind. This is why I’m so scared and pissed off and avoid giving specifics. I know it’s real. I know talking about such things is taboo to say the least and can put my life in danger. I would say I’m not the only victim of this. I’m sure there are more such victims. Most people don’t remember or are probably scared too. Most cannot function. I hope this doesn’t get deleted. I only posted this in 
‘unusual beliefs’ section because it is and because people don’t believe me obviously. I know this forum is run by Leftists so I wouldn’t be surprised if it gets deleted. I may have to ‘move’ to another site. I hope freedom is speech is recognized here. I’m not making ???? up. Because it happened in my past life(s) I cannot really expect to get help. You cannot really get help when the government is so corrupt and evil."

This also mean the individual can’t take new information as effectively due to the numbing effect. Its almost like sedation mode caused from alcohol, benzo etc. Due to this numbing effect the individual not find bad memory or thought so appealing thus less depression inducing. Without affecting memory the desired antidepressant affect can’t be reached. Actually a better way to bring the antidepressant affect is by improving cognition or improving the filter part of the brain so that mind can quickly filter out processing bad thoughts, memory. This way selectively choosing which to focus on and which to filter out. Certain drugs can do this. This why when we take such drugs we feel energetic, motivated and at the same time not indulge in depressive thoughts. Methylation drugs is one among them though there 
might be more. DMG is one among them. It not affect memory and at the same time bring the antidepressant property."

I read your posts all the time so I know your case of schizophrenia is bad but in the group homes and hospitals I’ve been in I’ve see other people with severe symptoms and they manage to talk to other people or go outside or do chores. I mean what do you see in your future? In AA they say, a lot of practicing alcoholics need help because their lives are terrible and they are miserable but they stay in misery and don’t seek help because at least the misery is familiar. It sounds like that’s kind of where you’re at. But what are you going to do if things change? What if you had to (god forbid) be hospitalized or move from your house or your parents died or even a natural disaster occurred? You would be totally unprepared. I’m not trying to be mean, I’ve got many stern lectures from people about shaping up when I wasn’t doing the right thing. I think that whether you realize it or not that you are a bit complacent. I think you are too used to having 
everything done for you. It’s robbed you of even wanting to try anything new. But it’s not hopeless, it’s not too late to change."

176099599,I’ve been schiz my whole life. At age 7 I was diagnosed (possibly misdiagnosed) with ADHD. around this age I started to go through severe abuse. This abuse started my DID. The DID worsened with more abuse coming from my psychiatrist at the time. I have 18 alters and we are currently in therapy. We have no desire to integrate and become a singular person though. Therapy is helping but its a slow process from our general distrust of doctors and the many layers to our conditions. If you have questions feel free to ask

176099616,That was my theory when I first started to hallucinate. I thought someone either slipped me some LSD or stopping antipsychotics made me psychotic. That’s the first time I found a forum to search for information. I take Geodon and I went to a forum called crazy meds and they had a whole section devoted to all the psych meds. It has since been shut down. Anyway I went on the Geodon thread and asked if anyone else had gotten psychotic by stopping it. Nobody commented. Most every one on that site that took Geodon were bipolar. There were very few people who reported being on it for psychosis. And there were a lot of threads. I read through them all.

174367339,"Abilify has been the best AP for me. I took it in tablet form until I could no longer get the tablets for free (have no insurance), so now I am on the Abilify Maintena depot shot. It still works quite well, even if I do have to take 5-10 mg/day of oral Haldol in addition to it. I have had no noticeable side effects from Abilify. Besides Abilify, Abilify Maintena and Haldol, I have also been on Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel and Latuda. Zyprexa used to be my go-to AP, even though it caused weight gain, but now it gives me awful akathisia, to the point that I cannot sleep on it. Same goes for Risperdal and Seroquel. Latuda just left me terribly flat, like scary/creepy flat, hated it. Haldol has side effects, too, but they are bearable. The worst with that is a stiff neck, but the Cogentin takes care of that."

Those qualities are all too rare in people & should be recognised more, they are great strengths. Much more important than being in a position of power & earning big bucks imo. _AT_MENTION_ yeah it does sound like depression. At 26 I had a fancy, white collar, high-end professional career. I was successful & got recognition & had this big reputation. I hated all of that & found it totally empty & unfulfilling, I was bitterly disappointed that all my life I’d worked to become that & that the result was so awful, I felt duped. So lonely. That was because I was clinically depressed (and psychotic but that’s by the by). Also because career just isn’t important to me, the most valuable part of my life is relationships. I learnt that the hard way. These days my career is very simple & my relationships, especially friends, are my top priority. My purpose is to be a good friend & have good friends, love & 
be loved. You mentioned you have good friends & are dating - how come you don’t find them fulfilling. Do you feel genuine connections with those people."

So does Sci-Fi. And again, with all due respect, I’ve adored this literary genre for most of my childhood and young adulthood years, but right now I avoid it like the plague, because during my psychosis I thought I lived in a simulated universe run by Nazi who had won WWII and were trying to recreate Jesus by eugenic methods. All of which boils down to failed upbringing by a dad obsessed with _PERSON_ and a grandmother who took me to chur
ch out of fear of hell rather than sane belief. So I’ve been to these extremes as well, the difference is I took my pills dilligently for 5 years and believed in recovery. I’m still not completely recovered, but at least I’m told (positive feedback from peers, see?) I’m much better now. And I’m able to work. And I can take care of myself, mostly.

But now I’ve adapted and that doesn’t really happen anymore. I just always wake up in the same position I fell asleep in. My boyfriend on the other hand clearly moves around a lot without waking up.

But I told him in nice way and all he said was he can see therapist and try to change. He wanted to try keep us together, made suggestions etc. And told me he’d phone tonight to see what I’ve decided I feel so f***ing torn up inside! How can I still proceed? Every time I raise issues about his occasional violence he tries to explain it away. For example - when I told him he threatened his mother with a knife once, he told me it was because I believed she was trying to poison me. So basically he believes me - that my possible delusion is real. But in past when it happened he told me why he did it was because she wouldn’t listen to him. He’s hard to resist when he’s all soft and gentle. He says we scare each other but said “a bit” but I don’t think it’s healthy to live in fear at all. I feel so awful! How can I leav

I have vistaril too but it doesn’t do much. Also have pretty annoying akathisia which cogentin isn’t doing nearly enough for . All that being said, my psychiatrist seems very wary of prescribing them. I haven’t really made a push for them, but I am meeting my family doc tomorrow to at least see what his opinion is on them. Does anyone take benzos as needed with good results? And if they’ve proven to be harmful/addictive to you, what other alternatives are there? Thanks."

But I’ve also been doing serious CBT with homework assignments and thought exercises and everything. My pdoc hopes to switch the gabapentin back to PRN eventually."

He was able to describe it better. That they were very large numbers like in the trillions, that they move very fast, sometimes the color of the rainbow and other times white, he sees a specific number 5,071 in the sky sometimes and then they just go away but he can’t shake them and they numbers keep running through his mind … he described it being like Pi… the 3.14******** bunch of numbers going on and on … that’s what he

176099929,One of my biggest problems with working is I can’t stand to be around most people and they can’t stand to be around me. I don’t think it’s ok for people to talk down at me. A few people where I volunteer talk down at me or give off bad vibes and I avoid them. I love volunteering with three people I volunteered with this week. I love them. I love the girls at another volunteer job I have too. It’s so great that I love them and enjoy working with them and that they are nice to me and don’t talk down at me or boss me about.cant stand that.my body starts to react. It is too much stress for me to work so my disability pension is one of the best things to ever happen to me. It’s better for my stability and mental health that I be on the pension. I liked working sometimes but I couldn’t stand it when people bossed me about and talked down at me and it depends on who you work with. I can’t stand being in same room as many people let alone work with them.lol There are jobs I would perhaps w
ant to do and enjoy doing. I think comedy would be fun but I don’t think I can be funny as such it might become shy. There are a few other jobs that could be fun. A guy on YouTube has Patreon’s and they pay a certain amount of money for every video he uploads or there are similar things they pay once a month. He has one fan that gives him $400 for one video. He can be independent just by having one single fan. He is very educated though and interesting. I enjoyed working at a cafe sometimes depending on who with. I enjoyed being a steri nurse and I e enjoyed a few other jobs too. But I feel I have special needs and I should have a special agent not a employment agency but a single professional agent who understands my wants and needs and strengths and who could make good pay deal for me to because maybe he she can get percentages or a good deal from it themselves. This professional could find job I want to do and would do good and even get paid well and I just say yes or no . I feel if I had a agent that 
knew how to handle me without supressing me or putting me down but empowering me to be my best and helping me get great work that I enjoy even that it could work. My agent would have to make sure that who ever I work with and for are compatible with me. I want a special agent that is all that I think. But I’m happy to be on disability pension. Because I can’t stand employment agencies and centrelink putting unrealistic demands on me to do things I can’t do. I notice I can do things with some people but with other people it’s impossible for me to do that. At volunteer work I could not unrack . I couldn’t. I felt overwhelmed and confused. Now I know it’s because the girls were bossing me about and talking down at me and I can’t stand that. I couldn’t do it. Then Another volunteer a man was around instead and he did not talk down at me but my three favourites left me in peace by the rack and I did two racks all by myself and quickly too. They left me in peace and I could do it. They brought out t
he best in me. I seriously did not think I could do it but I could. Depends who you work with and how they treat you.for me anyway. I love my manager. People can enjoy working. People do enjoy working I have enjoyed it? I need lots of time by myself in bed so I don’t want to work many hours. I only volunteer a few hours a week.

My father, in the past, put a gun to her head, hit her and has been to jail for it. This is a guy who could poison my water. It is possible, I wouldn’t call it impossible. From their perspective they have a burden living with them. The question is flushing the carrot juice my mother made an hour ago because she loves me and which is waiting in the refrigerator. But I know my brain makes these things and spams it. You know what, I’m going downstairs and forcing myself to quick belt that carrot drink and when nothing happens the cycle continues. Have you kept thinking your parents or family would poison you because they’ve had enough?"

It has made me believe that certain inserted ideas/thoughts are true, and sometimes it makes me believe that what happened in a dream wasn’t a dream but reality. There is only one occasion (that I can I remember) when it has made me believe in what the voice has said, and it also made me believe that the voice is coming from a real person (telepathically)."

174367443,"So here’s my plan. I’m going to attend an online distance learning school to take Business Administration majoring in Business Information Systems. Why this subject? Well, my father graduated from Harvard and knows economics pretty well. He also has a stash of business books in his library. I also think it’s most easiest ACCESS for me since I only attend classes face to face once a month. At the same time, I’m looking for a part time job where I only work less than 6 hours. The government in my country has an incentive where they supplement Disabled citizens additional salary. So I’m thinking of getting a job where I reach the maximum limit and get the Disabled Person’s Allowance. My goal is to live and work in Japan. I’m studying Japanese taking classes on Sundays. Who knows what will happen in 3 years. If everything goes according to plan, I will be a very, very happy… schizophrenic! A note to those ill: take advantage of your government and disability benefits. Use the disabled b
athrooms when you really need to. Get discounts for school. Commute and avoid traffic jams via public transportation, use the discounts if possible This will unload stress in the traffic."

176099964,"I kind of feel odd thinking that you had had psychosis, and now I am dumbfounded to know that you have “faked” it. Do you have psychosis, or are you freaking out and pretending that you do not have psychosis? I know the need for attention, but if you truly have lied about psychosis, I feel lied to because I could relate to you because you are so young- almost the age when I was formerly diagnosed with sz. Psychosis has scarred my life, bounced me from hospital to hospital, and ruined my grades. I honestly don’t know why you want to fake it. Psychosis is horrible."
176099965,Hmm. Well I would make an appointment anyways with them and see what they say. Have you tried taking them immediately after breakfast? Or immediately after you wake up? I find its easier to keep it consistent.
176099966,My sister is awesome too. I wish I lived a bit nearer to her. She’s like a second mother to me. I can tell her my mental and emotional troubles and she understands better than my mom. My mom tends to just bring up religion every time we talk of my difficulties.

It’s like funny things, when I want to rub my neck bcoz of itchy, one or more people around me did the same thing and same spot at their neck. Thats example. Got many type of coincidents. Then after 10 years later, I discover the word “synchrocity” related with crazy coincident. This world so mystery."

176099992,So. I’m making really good gains in my personal life. I’m older. One month off of 49 years old and been on meds since 1999. So this september I’m 20 years into the meds. There’s some things becoming apparent. I do less things that feed dopamine. I do more things that feed healthy living. I think I have hit a downward curve in the sz. I am way less horny. I don’t masturbate as much nor have desire too.( I’m no longer married nor in the market for a relationship) I still have a healthy interest but it’s not like it was. I don’t smoke cigarettes and this year I’ll be 10 years without a smoke. I’m wondering if a pattern is developing here! I’ve hit a milestone in my desire to lose weight. I’m a week under 100kgs and my fitness is getting good. I have started jogging 2km’s a day with a quick break in between to do some steps. I’m fitter than I was in my 30’s. I’m losing weight but everything is hard work! I’m still a person who doesn’t like discipline. I’m more a per
son who is “loose”. I flit from one thing to another and being disciplined is really hard work…but I’m getting there. Alls I’m saying is that if you put the work in then even an old dog can change. It’s never easy. It’s not fun. But It is something that can be done. I’m learning!

174367451,"Seriously, don’t listen to people who claim bad effects for longer than 3 months after one dose. The graph you show explains medication in the blood after multiple doses. Don’t worry too much. The negatives are typical of many aps- lessened emotional response, fatigue, apathy in general, and most of the negatives sz’s experience in general. Abilify is a good med, too. A lot of people have great results. It can cause you to be jittery, though I experienced that only the first day. Others do the entire time."
176099998,"Man, I’m so sorry. What did she say that made you feel so bad?"

176100003,Have you talked to your doctor at all?
176100004,"Honestly I never had my own self paid insurance, so i never really thought I had much say in my treatment, if they do feel that way. Alternatives would have been nice though. I could have been more adept at argueing my case too, which is a good skill to have in psych wards and such. I mean I could have played the situation for better outcomes, but I dont really do that all well. They are stuck in thier way, pills and psych wards are the best way. I havnt the power or strength to do much, but go along somewhat and complain."
176100005,He asked me tonight if I’m ok. I know he cares. Paranoia is our perception. Its like someone’s favorite color is their favorite color. You can’t change it. So I’m glad he hauled along as long as he did. I’m going to try not talk about people cause my perception of people is way off. If we are together with people. He is my glue to keep me in reality
176100006,"Something my therapist taught me, was that a lot of my own rejection fears came from the fact I have been rejecting myself for years. The voices picking on me, chipping away my self esteem for years, leaving me with no self respect, believing I was these horrible things they told me. I had no love for myself, I couldn’t see that there are parts of me that others may like, even love. That was a big source of the issue for me"
176100007,I can’t talk politic about the state of the economy but I can talk about people who are cool as ass and I’d put you in that category matey. Yeah life is problematic because there’s no way around dealing with dickheads unless it’s with humor and a good spirit and you do that so well! Honestly. I think after all you’ve been through you still face life with a smile and a bit of moxy! I like that in you and just want to say your someone who has dealt with a lot and will keep on doing so! Have faith in yourself and stuff the haters! Your way better than that!
176100008,I never hurt the innocent or never thought I did so don’t know why I think this. If I did it I never knew I did. So now I don’t know if I actually hurt people.
176100009,What was the word?
176100010,"No, I have never been on two antipsychotics at once. I kind of miss some of the half-sleep hallucinations because they were intricate and beautiful, but they still count as a symptom and I’m looking to treat those. Hopefully you don’t get too tired from it, Seroquel made me feel pretty spacey. Different meds work for different people though of course."
176100011,"Me and probably millions of Schizos have tried to get rid of the meds before, but mostly failed. It’s kind of part of being young, that one wants to not take meds. I’m 40 now and wont risk anymore. I’m gonna take my meds. I think if you find a right med and a right dose, they can be very Ok."

Free will is our ability to think and move make our own decisions as we please. While determinism is based upon that everything is pre determined. I think there’s a middle ground in that both those things are true. That’s why god is so incredible to me. But _NAME_ just seems a little programmed like a bot.

Maybe if we ever get an understanding of the underlying pathology behind these mental illnesses we may find that they are actually the same disease with different presentations.

I digg her and appreciate the book. I can have difficulties reading but I’m really enjoying this book. I have liked some royal people on Facebook because I like seeing them around but I do not think they are superior to me and I do not believe in me saluting anyone. I rather curtsy or put hands together and now head slightly. I was treated really badly when _NAME_ was pm but I digg a lot of what she did and one of those things is she is actually against monarchy and shook the queens hand and did not see her as more than herself yet was kind and gave them a kangaroo she had knitted.

I do not want to salute anyone. I rather bow to the flag or curtsy . I am not keen on the army like stuff that goes on… I do not agree with it for me . I might continue to like them on Facebook but I don’t want anything to do with them if they did not accept my different opinion and beliefs. I am not to be treated badly and I chose not to salute and be bossed about by rude people thinking they are superior me when they are not.

176100138,"Do you think that at least one of your memories isn’t real? If you do, then you are left with an interesting situation. If at least one isn’t real, then it’s possible that more than one isn’t real. But there isn’t any effective way to discern which is real and which isn’t beyond finding out which ones other people have a shared consensus on, or simply choosing which ones to believe in and which ones to discard as byproducts of an overactive brain. So choose. Do you want to believe that your memory of something terrible that’s improbable according to general consensus is true? If not, chalk it up to your brain playing tricks that most people don’t have to deal with. Your diagnosis comes with a lot of lame stuff you need to deal with. But there’s a power to the diagnosis too - you know that some things you experience simply aren’t real and are a symptom of a misbehaving brain chemistry. I strongly suspect that the experience of sz roughly approximates the experience of someone wit
hout sz when on hallucinogenic drugs, but because that’s the default state of sz, one is never really able to “come down” from the dissociative state without successful response to AP drugs. So without the ability to re-center yourself with the reference point of the reality of shared consensus, it’s really hard to correct course when fears take over and start defining reality. But you can Google pretty much any one of the sensations you’ve had along with the term “DMT” or “LSD” and you’ll probably see very similar experiences. Now - is this because this is some sort of hidden truth that can be revealed with a fluid mind? Meh, probably not. Some of the tropes that occur more commonly now don’t predate their points of reference (i.e. experiences of being abducted by aliens before the 1950s). It’s more likely that our brain isn’t that creative so it pulls from material it’s been exposed to in constructing a divergent reality that conforms to whichever trope fits with an experience ba
sed on physiological foundations (such as an out-of-body experience manifesting pre-50s as a spiritual communion and post-50s as an alien abduction based on which reference material was most accessible to an excited brain). Which is really empowering, as it means that the reality our mind creates for us isn’t something fixed and static. Because just as there’s reports of drug trips experiencing being on a table examined by aliens or being in hell, there’s also reports of experiences of euphoria and a sense of wonder and majesty. I really do think self-forgiveness and the forgiveness of others is key. For me, I simply couldn’t run away from my paranoid thought loop until I sat down, and really thought about if I forgave myself. I’m not perfect. But I’m certainly “mostly” a good person. And I still couldn’t escape it as long as I thought that others deserve punishment either. So I forgave them too. I decided Hell is simply a bad person’s idea of heaven, where they can hurt people because tha
t’s what they enjoy (and with our knowledge of simulations and the Turing test, that could simply be a GTA-style simulation with NPCs that don’t really experience anything but are convincing enough to fool people). Maybe everyone gets whatever they want after this life, and part of this world being the way it is is so that people can figure out what their idea of paradise is by having a balanced and random reference against which they could define what they think would be better. The other key to breaking the thought pattern was recognizing that when something isn’t observed, it’s every possible thing (which we know is “real” at the smallest level of reality). And what’s interesting, is that the property can apply backwards in sequentiality (the “quantum eraser” concept). So I basically decided to stop observing a version of reality that only I could observe that I didn’t like, and only observe/recognize it as possibly being real and not a figment of my imagination if I actually liked it. 
Because both heaven and hell are equally “real” as concepts, and both are at a physical level equally accessible for a wandering mind, but it’s a lot harder to manifest a world of positivity when we are angry at ourselves or others. And I think you’re spot on when you say “I may be making a bigger deal about it than I thought.” Do you believe in God? Do you trust God? Then trust that things are going to be alright in the end. Personally, I’ve been entertaining the idea that the lack of punctuation in ancient languages caused a bit of a misinterpretation when the first commandment was “You shall have no gods before me.” Maybe it was “You shall have no gods before ‘me’”? Basically, don’t put the pursuit of religious truth above your own well-being. If God exists and we are part of God’s intention, then we exist for a reason, and it may well not be God’s intention that we spend all of our time obsessing over the how and why of things and should just trust the process a bit more. L
ife is so complex and dynamic and filled with such a vast array of experiences. Part of free will means that we can go down the rabbit hole of thinking about the unknowable, but we probably shouldn’t do that excessively to the point it negatively impacts us, and should probably only do that to the extent that the pursuit of observing the unobservable is enjoyable as a concept and not frustrating as an impossibility. My favorite Socrates quote is “All that I know is that I know nothing.” Nothing in life is certain. And because of that generalized uncertainty, a better compass to guide our assumptions of what is real or isn’t might better be “will this make me happy?” as opposed to “do I think this is plausibly real?” Because an infinite number of things might be plausibly real, which leads to circular reasoning and downward spirals of thought. But theoretically, by A/B testing concepts and ideas, we can define a singular version of what we believe about the world that makes us the happiest. So 
if you believe you deserve to be happy (which is its own hurdle to get past), then the next step logically would be “what can I change about my current situation to help achieve that result?” You seem like you are on the right path with some of the physical stuff like living a healthier life. Maybe applying the same process to the mental stuff can help start moving in a positive direction on that front as well. Or at very least, recognizing that the unknowable is less important in the immediate than the knowable of friends, family, and self-care."

I dyed it with red henna as well yesterday But the newfound freedom comes with sadness too. Leaving my husband is the right thing to do but the hardest thing as well. I love him and I’m going to miss him - even though he was very negative and argumentative and has illness He told me that he found out by religious scholar today that hes not obliged to pay me maintenance even now with separation unless I live on my own. But I told him how can I live on my own?? Don’t have job or house or licence. I live with my sister now and I need my family’s support. Must find out tomorrow from muslim judicial council the true facts. I always thought maintenance was due to me till actual divorce. The reality of being on my own is starting to sink in. I feel so scared of my future. I feel like I just want to end it all… I’m 
glad I have my sister and two brothers to help me! But I need to find a work-from-home from home job really quickly! At the moment I feel so miserable - and this effing covid doesn’t make it any easier! I’m sick of wearing masks and I’m sick of hearing about it!!! When the eff is it going to effing END??? Why did the damn thing get so out of control??? Why does this crap happen??? My life is crumbling around me.

It’s real but no one believes it or cares or knows about it or understands it but me, really. Actually it is. I’ve been on almost all the APs and only Vraylar helps my mood and my negative symptoms. The dose is actually higher than the FDA recommended amount: I’m at 9mg, which is a lot. I’ve explained numerous times that I think it’s the energy drinks but no one can help me and the insurance companies don’t view energy drinks as a real threat or addiction. I’m supposedly supposed to see an ADHD doctor to get more and better help. Trying to every day. I have tried other meds and none of them do squat. I’m looking into alternative methods. Sometimes, I think “why bother anymore on this forum.” No offense, and I’m just really frustrated as you can see. No one can help me or my struggles. I was told I have a microchip a

176100177,just a hypothesis
176100178,I’m in a similar spot to you _AT_MENTION_ . I never had a problem with aggression until I had psychosis where (especially early on) I had plenty of times where I felt rage and was destructive.

176100186,It’s weird the number of people here who say that they think they faked their illness. I can’t understand that. I don’t understand why that you would. But as long as you continue to take your meds I guess it doesn’t matter.
176100187,"I am mentally not fit to do that. I think extreme lifestyles take extreme measures. I am getting thoughts of being a chosen one and such. I maybe choose myself, actually the voices. I am so stressed to quit smoking. I am already taking valium to calm down."

Did you experience voices that were louder and more frequent as the meds wore off or did you choose another med to replace risperidone? I’ve stopped all my meds since my injection in July and was wondering if what I was experiencing is normal."

L Lipskaya-Velikovsky, D Elgerisi, A Easterbrook and NZ Ratzon, Disability and rehabilitation, 2019 06 Employment offers many benefits to people with mental illness, yet their employment rate is much lower than that of the general population. We investigated the effect of work-related motor skills, neurocognition, and job attitudes on the work performance of people with mental illness, comparing those working in sheltered workshops, with controls working in similar jobs.Twenty-nine adults with severe mental illness and 27 controls matched by gender and age were enrolled into the study using convenience sampling. They were assessed for gross and fine motor hand functioning, job attitudes, work performance, and cognition.People with mental illness scored lower on work performance, cognitive functioning, and hand dexterity while sitting and working with tools. They were assigned lower job loads than we
re controls, and perceived the physical environment at work as more constraining than did controls. Assembling motor skills significantly explained the work performance of people with mental illness.The results expand our understanding of the complexities involved in the employment of people with severe mental illness, and point to new paths for improving vocational outcomes of people with severe mental illness, taking into account their motor skills and job attitudes. Implications for rehabilitation Therapists should be aware that employed people with severe mental illness may have various unmet needs, affecting their work performance and experience of stress. This study results demonstrate importance of motor skills and perception of the work environment for the promotion of vocational outcomes among individuals with severe mental illness. Employment of people with severe mental illness should be viewed from holistic perspective as with general population, rather than focused on traditionally illness-relate

174367546,"I was diagnosed at 12 years old which has had a significant impact on my life and my identity. A few years after I left the hospital, as a teenager, I used to say that “I was a schizophrenic” not wanting to acknowledge that just because the auditory hallucinations were gone, didn’t mean that I wasn’t still a person with this illness. Because of the heavy _USER_ID_ of this illness, I stigmatized myself and others who have it. Now 16 years later, I’ve had 3 hospital stays in my 20s (in addition to another one at 13 years old, a year after my initial hospital stay) and I’ve finally acknowledged that this will forever be a part of my life. I finally understand that the medication has to be a permanent part of my life or I will get psychotic symptoms again. But it’s not been all bad. I’ve been able to go to high school and graduate even after the school board in my city said that I shouldn’t be able to go to a regular high school since my illness was so severe. Because of my perseveran
ce and innate belief in my worthiness and value at a young age, I proved them wrong and even got on the honour roll a few times. I’ve also been to university although I haven’t graduated yet. I feel that I have lost the belief in myself that I’ve had at a young age, at least to that degree, but I’ve been trying to get it back. My last hospital stay this past November opened my eyes finally and fully to the reality of my illness. It also opened my eyes to the unhealthy coping mechanisms I used to deal with my loneliness like speaking to strangers online and not forming real life connections, procrastination, and a lack of self care among other things. Although I don’t have any big accomplishments and I don’t feel that I’ve fully realized my potential yet, I feel that I am a success story and what’s most important for me is that I have hope and look forward to my days again. I hope everyone on this forum finds their version of happiness and I also recommend the _NAME_ Talk by _PERSON_ as well as 
the movie A Beautiful Mind about _NAME_ which I see someone mentioned already. Good luck to everyone"

176100319,"Supporting companies that have unethical practices is bad but almost everyone does it and most don’t even know about it. If you deserve to go to hell for that then pretty much everybody does. You can’t get down on yourself when some of these companies have monopolies on certain goods and you can’t get it anywhere else. And the ones with alternatives, well, sometimes the alternatives pale in comparison to them. I suggest you do some research on what companies are shady and look for viable alternatives so you can feel good about not supporting the bad ones. And if you can’t do it, just accept that nobody is perfect and even though paying the bad companies is enabling them it doesn’t make you culpable for their actions. If you gave a homeless man money and he goes and buys drugs with it, are you to blame for enabling his addiction? Some would say yes but I think not because your intention was probably that he buys food with the money. It should be the homeless man who is to blame for his add
iction, not you. It’s all about the intention. Is your intention that companies take your money and use it to kill children? No. And you’re just one person. If one person supports or doesn’t support a bad company it won’t make much of a difference. If you could somehow make everyone boycott them, then you would be making a difference. But that’s extremely hard. You can’t save the world all by yourself."

174367548,I started trying online dating and now have a possible date on Saturday. It’s been a while since I went on a date (since before I was diagnosed) and feels like a nice idea. The thing for me is I feel like I’m being deceptive – like I’m fooling the person to thinking I’m a certain way and then will surprise them with schizophrenia down the line. Another part of the reason it’s hard is because everything ended so badly with my last ex when I became more psychotic . . . any advice? wisdom? similar experiences?

I didn’t work for pay until almost 10 years later and didn’t stay that way long. I did a 3 year stint as a VISTA volunteer for pay after that and then dropped out completely as life got more complicated and my efforts to find the perfect drug bit me on the @##.

It was a terrible habit but fortunately it stopped. I also had a bit of an eating disorder from 16—>antipsychotics I think. And tons of compulsions/obsessions over the years. It’s gotten better with antidepressants and other meds and life. But still have it. They say cats are ocd. My cat definitely has ocd. I’ve had it since a very young age though. I think ocd is a symptom of schizophrenia. I read in surviving schizophrenia that rather than a separate diagnosises they often list it as a symptom of schizophrenia because it’s so common for szs to have at least some ocd. Ocd is an anxiety disorder. Definitely can also have a psychotic aspect to it. Especially when very serious and untreated. I’ve never been diagnosed with it but I know I have it a bit.

176100396,"I’m not doing as well as you as you have a job. I go on and on seeing no one, day after day, no work acquaintances, no nothing. I talk to a therapist once a week and a pdoc once a month. I got my first covid-19 vaccine shot, so I got out to see the doctor. I practiced all week by getting out every day to stores to see cashiers and rode the bus just fine. Otherwise my anxiety would have made me crack up. Soon I’ll have my follow up shot and be ready to go to my twelve step meetings again. I choose to wait until then. I have texting with my siblings and phone my mom every day. I have to have the self love to get out, even to just sit outside Starbucks and have a soda. If I didn’t stay clean and sober I’d be out of my mind in one day. I’m stepping outside in about fifteen minutes to buy Spam at the pharmacy."
176100397,"One day you may learn that the only person who can help you is yourself. Saying “I can’t” won’t help you at all. You are cognisant and lucid and realise you are wasting away in bed all day. It is up to you to change it. Giving up ,saying can’t. No one can help you but yourself at the end of the day. Start small, get a handgrip exerciser, stay out of bed. Walk. Gradually build it up. Don’t rely on a magic med to heal all because they don’t exist. Realise it is up to you and you alone! Loads of people have come back from catatonia and make it. There is only so long before you get so fed up of doing nothing that you do something. Start now. Put your feet out of bed and stay out of it, increasing it every day. Sorry for the harsh words, but you can do it. So do it! you go to the toilet don’t you?

174367575,"Hello, I am one of the ones Haldol has done wonders for. I tried , I think 3 anti psychotics, prior to trying Haldol. I think they were abilify, risperidol, and Geodon. Geodon was the worst, it made me want to die… very literally. It made the symptoms worse and I was a total mess on Geodon. I started on 1 mg of Haldol 10 years ago and that put me back into a functioning state. It stopped the voices and the delusions. I have been lucky to be able to maintain on .5-1mg of Haldol for the past 10 years. One thing I want to note is that I feel that Haldol has stopped working as well as it did when I was first put on it. When I was first put on it it worked really well. But now I feel it only works about half as well but I stay on it out of fear that nothing else will work better. P.M. me if you want to hear more of my story."

If your doctor prescribes you a medication, I would trust that over the advice of me, a random internet stranger. Individual brains all respond differently to medications, so it is very possible for certain people to do well on stimulants and antipsychotics together."

Expecting to be jacked by December is more on the unrealistic side of the possible results spectrum. Break it down to more reasonable goals and don’t rush the process.

In fact, I like the method of not even worrying about looks and focus more on methods and milestones of what you can physically do. It will help more long term, especially when you’re still new."

She was clearly manic and needed to go to the hospital but the peer support worker didn’t do anything about it.

176100510,Meds can sometimes take up to two months to have a noticeable effect. I’d say give the ones you’re on some time to work.

176100513,"as I watch these vast hills which line up this landscape, and with my small, withered hands that are put upon my knees, I know that the heavens took no pity on me and dropped me here. and I do not deserve pity; I have hurt thousands of people; including the dear one I love, that I have adored so much. with countless bottles of pills, I have drowned him and now the heavens have declared me to be guilty. I have asked the heavens to drown me, but why am I still living? I have let them to decide my fate. I do not choose mine. I’ve asked them to blind my eyes and cut my ears, for I deserve it; I deserve it all. I shall weep here, and I shall die alone. and I do not despise the heavens; the heavens are just. may all the souls I have drowned, rest in peace, and for mine, let the heavens drown my soul completely."
176100514,"I think you might have misunderstood the statement. Pls divide it into two halves and read it again, especially the second half. Dr. _PERSON_"
176100515,Well mainly a professional diagnosis confirmed my suspicions. I had lots of blackouts ending up in places I didn’t recognize while people would call me by a name that wasn’t mine. Also family and friends would comment on my “strange” behavior. For example me behaving very stoic or sucking my thumb when I am not likely to do those things Also sometimes when I dissociate its like I’m in the back seat of my body and I’ll watch my alters do things though it feels very dream-like Also i found we could communicate through writing. And it’s a decent way to learn about them!! Genuinely once I figured out I had DID it just made so much sense and it explained so much. It explained a lot of things that were happening to me. I hope this made sense
176100516,I started with Wellbutrin 3 weeks ago. It gives me more energy during the day. I feel less tired and it takes the edges of my depression. I like it!
176100517,"I’m on risperidone and it helps a little bit, I already had OCD pre-SZ. SSRI is more beneficious, but it really works on tremendous doses, for example I am on 10mg escitalopram (lexapro) and maximum dose is 20mg so for OCD it is recommended to take 40mg to feel real effect."
174367595,I take Latuda and was symptom free almost at 80mg. Just reduced it to 40mg and im noticing changes in my thinking and hearing whispers. I might put it back up to 80. Forgot to mention it gives me insomnia.

176100528,I also went running in the woods behind my house at night without a _USER_ID_. I was staying up for 3 or 4 days straight snorting adderall and playing Mount and Blade. I constructed a crossbow style molotov cocktail launcher because I was mad at someone. I ended up injecting adderall during this time and had to go to the hospital because I missed a vein. That was embarrassing.

176100530,I went into the psych ward 16 days ago after staying in the ER for a day. There were a couple cool people who I think could be my friend at least through texting although we weren’t supposed to share numbers but there were a number of people that I did like and I shared numbers with four people I think. What made this experience so bad was partly my mind state. Worst doctors I’ve ever experience although one of the doctors is good it wasn’t my doctor. The social worker was OK she knew what she was doing even if I didn’t always agree with her on things. And towards the end of my stay there was one lady who is 61 years old and had been taking antipsychotics for 40 years. Well they gave her a combo of antipsychotics that triggered dementia in her by the time I was ready to leave. She came in displaying no memory problems but then I think the meds they gave her induced Dementia in just a weeks time. And she was one of the best people there before this happened and then it was just sad Then the l
ast day I had built a friendship with a girl who had the same birthday as my mom and we talked a lot about things and we had in common but I never wanted to meet a girl in the psych ward but I was friends with her enough that when this 18-year-old guy started choking her and attacking her on her birthday after an argument with this look in his eyes like he wanted to kill her. I had walked right in on the event. It was really Traumatic for everyone I think but I didn’t know how to react other than yelling what The ???? is wrong with you and yelling and running to get Staff. There were these two dudes who are huge who are right there fortunately to get him off otherwise I would’ve had to intervene physically. Idk what got into that guy at that time. He calmed down after and they took the watch off him within 24 hours I think

176100535,No religion here I’ll think about what you said It’s really hard to stop and I guess I hate feeling powerless over something that I don’t like what it does. You know I wanna be strong but it’s hard to be strong. Maybe I’m sexually addicted in general. If I could get laid easily I’d probably do it a lot instead of porn. So maybe it’s not porn but I’m a horny mfker But it definitely is porn a bit…
176100536,probably…

176100543,"Thanks _PERSON_. It is a very powerful tool to have in your toolbox of coping strategies. I like your description of it, and can appreciate what you mean by seeing things from a slightly better vantage point. It is quite helpful that way, and yes I do practice it all through the day as merely being mindful of my Sensations. It’s like the saying, it’s not what you do but how you do it"

They have graphs to show you how you’re progressing. They also have fitness videos, general forums, as well as groups you can join if that’s your thing. There’s a lot you can do there. I only use the nutrition and weight trackers myself. It takes a little longer to log your food at first, until you get things saved on your favorites list or in groupings. Now I can log a week’s worth of meals in about 10 minutes. I am down 12 pounds, so it’s working! Good luck!"

174367624,When I started paliperidone two years ago my periods stopped. I didn’t think much of it st first but then I also started lactating and my breasts got very big…also read on this forum about prolactin and figured that must be the problem. Aripiprazole 5mg has been added to lower my prolactin and my periods have come back. However I get no warning signs either. Got a blood test on Monday to see what the levels are now. Hopefully they have gone down.

176100600,Im so sorry _AT_MENTION_
176100601,Use your driving record as proof that you can drive. Find a new doctor that is more supportive. I had a doctor try to take away my keys once. I told her no so she had me committed against my will. I didn’t find out until years later when I got my hospital records that she told the hospital I was hearing voices telling me to rape someone. Tell me that ain’t messed up. Now I have that on my record. Nothing good will come from a controlling doctor. Some doctors are power hungry and they don’t like you questioning their authority. They think because they’re the doctor they have the final say. Seriously get a new doctor. When you meet a new doctor tell them your situation and ask them if they’d be supportive of you making your own decisions. As long as you don’t threaten violence or suicide they should let you make your own decisions or at the very least have a say so it’s your life. You’re working and trying to make the best of your situation.

174367622,"Wow thats a tough call. Be blind, or Schizophrenic. I have negative symptoms and typically think that delusions and disturbing hallucinations seem scarier and more emotionally tolling then my depressed mood and motivation. I feel that I would stay a schizophrenic. I’ve seen such beautiful art, played so many games that helped me through tough times, art and media are so important to my current satisfaction I feel like I would be bored and a little scared if I was blind. I don’t pray for any illness on anyone but I got lucky. I pray those with blindness live fulfilling lives but I’m a very visual person. I don’t know what I would say if my symptoms were worse at the moment or if my mother wasn’t so amazing. I do feel though that I should never have children because of the potential trauma of my illness through their formative years, and the 25% some odd chance that they develop Schizophrenia. I feel really sad because I know my mother has been so important to me, and us to her. Living the 
rest of my life seemingly forced down a lonely trajectory by the sheer odds of it being against us schizophrenics means that I feel a little dismissive about having a future. I feel like once my body or mind breaks down enough I’ll kill myself or seek out euthanasia. The elderly already have such a hard time in our society I don’t have the strength to face that fate as I slowly wither while knowing no one cares about me."

176100618,What makes you scard
176100619,_PERSON_ is the only one I’ve heard of. And I’ve never heard of anyone taking it for more than a year or so.
174367627,"Same. I don’t believe its a spiritual disease. But like Buddhist/philosophy or just general positive thinking has definitely helped me cope and adapt to it. The issue you point out is important though not to go too deep into new age theories/because there are a lot of scammers out there who prey on the vulnerable. Like people who will say “Schizophrenia doesn’t exist” and then try to do an exorcism on you. Sleep paralysis for example is not anything spiritual/can be triggered my toxic thoughts just like nightmares/ but it is actually sleep apnea most likely means you have trouble sleeping i found out I have severe sleep apnea I am supposed to be getting a CPAP machine but am waiting on insurance to approve it. So most things can point to something physical going on. with schizophrenia, or bipolar or depression it is something we will have because it’s something we had a genetic predisposition for and ends up happening no matter what. When I first became Ill I was healthy, vegetarian, a si
ze Zero, and even though I was having trouble fitting in it was the disease/symptoms/illness that left me marginalized."
176100620,I’ve had this exact same split functionality issue. It’s kind of wild. I’m sorry you deal with it.

176100624,"Oopphh, that’s rough. She was a big part of both of your lives, the world is still a mess, med change. That’s a lot of stressors. I can understand why you’re feeling off. You’ve never struck me as weak, you’ve too much fire. The fight is hard right now, but I still believe in your strength. I have faith you can come through this. Time helps as the change settles, but we’re allowed to feel until then. Be safe Mr. _PERSON_. You have a llama in your corner."
174367629,"And also, because I have a formal diagnosis, my insurance covers 100% of Seroquel, and I get a box with 60 pills in it. Seeing as I no longer take it for sleep and only need it for prn, that means I have all the Seroquel I need for the foreseable future. Sycrest I have to pay 25%, but a box will last me two months once I’m done upping my dose, and it’s only 38 Euros, so that’s not too bad I suppose."

I think when covid calms down, I’ll put myself out there to start teaching again. I don’t want to teach a beginner on video. I need to be able to touch their hands, wrists, and elbows.

176100638,"Before being diagnosed and receiving help I was miserable – I was moody and struggling with an eating disorder. I contemplated taking recreational drugs, it was that bad. Thankfully I never went that far. The psychotic break that led to my hospitalization, diagnosis, and treatment left me vulnerable and depressed for a while. It occurred two years ago and the healing process was…unlike anything I’d been through before. I’m still somewhat affected by my psychosis but it doesn’t have nearly as much control over my life as it did before. I’ve managed to work since my break. I worked a stressful fast food job for eight months. I recently quit to focus on other things. I’m looking forward to getting back on track with getting to where I want to be!

176100642,Ah ok I guess he just has higher expectation. It’s not too surprising. Like if your landlord works full-time he may be thinking why he has to work all the time and you don’t. And with our mostly invisible illness is why someone would think that way. I mean if you were missing your legs he’d probably be way more empathetic. Kinda tricky cuz if you work too much you’ll get kicked off the welfare. Maybe 1 or 2 days a week of work would help

174367645,"Mine’s gotten better over time. You come to realize the voices are just static. They sound intelligent but they really aren’t, it’s just noise. There’s not really any person inserting images or thoughts, it’s just that the brain thinks up things you wouldn’t normally think about if you didn’t have schizophrenia. That’s what I consider intrusive thoughts. Like if you see a friend and you think something inappropriate or see a violent image, that’s just the brain malfunctioning. I think the first step is learning to act sane while keeping your inner dialogue separate from others. If you need to talk about it, you can always talk to people on the forum, your psychiatrist, or maybe a member of your support network, but only if they are designated as someone to lean on. To most people you have to try to come of as normal if you can. You basically go from having abnormal thoughts and acting abnormal to having abnormal thoughts and acting normal and finally, hopefully, to acting normally 
and having mostly normal thoughts. Medicine and time seems to help. I hope things get better for you soon."
176100650,"Yeah, I do. Sometimes I go out even longer if it is a big walk. What I normally do is get a map out and try and plan a route along it and go out and hike the route.

I’m going to start taking the four flights of stairs in my apartment complex every day and see if that will make a difference. Also, start buying and eating more salad kits from the grocery store.

176100680,"I’m just wondering - maybe my mom had a touch of sza gene but it wasn’t fully expressed in her like in me. Because she was (and still is) very religious and spoke a lot about demon possession and said to me when I was a teenager that she believed I’d be a prophet in the church when I was older, and she saw a vision once when I was a baby. But if this was psychosis I don’t think so because she didn’t have depression and mood swings and avolition and lack of hygiene and social withdrawal etc like me. And her beliefs were consistent with her religious group. My “delusions” are slightly different level to my religion. They are tied up in it but my pdoc said my spirits in my head are not what other Muslims experience but a part of my illness. Plus I had the disorganised behaviour and depression and social problems etc of sza. Not only psychosis symptoms."

174367662,"On Caplyta (Lumateperone) it outperformed placebo in 2 of 3 late stage trials apparently due to a high placebo response rate. As far as the points reduction on the PANSS it seems to have been pretty consistent throughout the trials. I don’t know of a scale of how strong antipsychotics are. This has some information on the response rate: mdedge.com Lumateperone for schizophrenia shows safety, tolerability in long-term study COPENHAGEN – One-quarter of patients showed clinically meaningful weight reduction. At 150 days of treatment in 340 patients, 30% had achieved a PANSS response, defined as at least a 20% improvement in PANSS total score, compared with baseline. At 300 days in the smaller group who had reached that milestone at the time of the interim analysis, the PANSS response rate had grown to 41%. Among patients with schizophrenia and comorbid depression as defined by a Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) score of 6 or more at baseline, lumateperone at 42 mg/day improved dep
ressive symptoms, such that 60% of those patients achieved a CDSS response – that is, at least a 50% reduction in the score – by day 75. Some other antipsychotics appear to have higher response rates. But there’s no test for who will be a responder and who won’t. This would probably be best discussed with your doctor. This is a new medication and they haven’t yet had the opportunity to really compare it against others in the long term. My best guess (I am not a doctor) is it’ll work for some and not others, and for those it does work for, the side effect profile seems promising."

They’ve only met the severe cases and it pisses me off. There are people like _NAME_ who have it and probably some billionaires like Mark _PERSON_.

Tbh, i think psychiatry is a psuedo science, not much scie
ntic proof but all are hypothesis , i would be more healthier had i not go to a psy clicnic at first , the theory has never been proven , the reliance of so called DSM-V actually can create more mental illness than it has originally.But mental illness /psychosis /wrecked mind is definitely a undeniable fact though imo."

176100730,"I primarily got a side effect called akathisia, which causes you to walk in circles out of a sense of horrible restlessness. There was some cognitive impairment too, but it wasn’t the most distressing thing. Honestly Seroquel also made me feel that way, although the Zyprexa I’m on now doesn’t make me feel cognitively impaired at all. Different meds affect different people in different ways though. It sucks having to try different antipsychotics and going through ones that make you feel worse than before you took them, but it’s worth it because eventually you will land on one that makes you feel a lot better with either mild or no side effects. It took me a little over a year of trial end error with 5 different antipsychotics (the fifth one works a lot better than any of the previous ones) before landing on the one I’m on now."

176100768,"My disagreement with Psychiatry, is that they tend to put all emphasis on how it looks from the outside, when they are not living it on the inside. There is a tendency to disempower the patient, by telling them that they are only valid through outside opinion. I agree, when your brain is scrambled as it is at the outset of schizophrenia, you are not able to self-analyze. But if you are stable and functioning, chances are you have much more insight into your condition than anyone could ever have from the outside looking in. I have had extremely negative experiences with psychiatrists."

176100819,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! It really is a nice office and a nice place to volunteer. No cubicles to be found, each person has their own office. It’s bright and open. I work at a desk in the Volunteer Coordinator’s office, but I answer to the Office Manager. She’s putting the word out to people like the Social Workers, RN’s, and the Bereavement Coordinator that there is a willing volunteer. I anticipated going eight to ten hours a week, but they didn’t have enough work this week. There’s plenty of time for projects if they can come up with them. The billing job I mentioned is for the big hospice agency that owns the hospice where I volunteer. The head office does all the administrative work for the hospices they own, so the local hospices can concentrate on patient care. They have hospices in eight states, including _NAME_ where I live. I would love to work for the parent company. I tried applying for a payroll specialist job there but I didn’t have ADP experience so they said no. The billi
ng job is my second attempt to work there. I told them in my cover letter that I’m volunteering two days a week downstairs, so I’m already around if I get selected to interview. Really hoping I get a chance at it. I got a status update on my application for an accounts payable rep for a university medical center. They said I wasn’t chosen to interview. That didn’t break my heart. That university is where my last job was, nearly two years there, and I’ve been snubbed by them now that I’m trying to go back to work. I would rather not go back to the university, but they’re such a big employer, I can’t eliminate them from contention, I don’t have that luxury. I have three resumes out there now - the Administrative Assistant for my city’s Fire Department, the billing job with the hospice parent company, and the Accounts Payable job with my mental health community services board. I’m starting to find more things to apply for, which is a relief! I have good feelings about all these jobs, just h

176100871,All you’re doing here is making yourself sicker each time you post one of these.
176100872,There is a lot to be said for having the space to do what you want to do without worrying about commitments all the time. I get tired very quickly and need a lot of time to myself to recharge.
174367694,"If I had to recommend just one supplement for cognitive decline it would be a amino acid complex. I work out regularly and I noticed I always felt better after exersise and tought it was the exersise that did it, but then one day I started thinking what else I was doing when I exersised and came to think that I usually take a amino acid complex after for building muscle. I started experimenting with taking it every day and felt much better. My brain was not exactly painful, but was irritable and never at ease. Taking a amino acid complex changed that. I’m much less irritable in my head now and able to concentrate better."
176100873,If I could go to the police every day and file a police report.
176100874,Just keep working on it and do your best. Hopefully everything will work out.
176100875,Thanks for the info bro!
176100876,"That’s a great idea! The only hard part would be quantifying what they say. Maybe quantify is the wrong word… I guess how would I use statistics and data to show their opinion? Since it has to be backed by research I’m thinking of tackling mental health and the corrections system. I was listening to a _NAME_ talk, I think from _PERSON_ but I cant remember 100%, and she said that a county jail in California has the biggest psychiatric center in America. I would also like to talk about how in my state of Michigan there are like 7.3 psych beds per 100,000 residents, and the national average is 11.4 or something. Its astounding to me that there are people who cant get treatment until they end up in jail, and I’ve been reading a lot of them are in jail for substance abuse because there is a high comorbidity between mental illness and substance abuse. Sorry for the mini rant, lol."

Also, while living alone, I was not aware of all the advancements society was making. I had fallen behind. I am better off now, by living in adult foster care."
176100881,"I had psychosis NOS for 5 years until I stopped meds and relapsed. Then it was changed to schizophrenia. The Dr warned me that if I stop my meds and relapse it will be changed to sz. For me it doesn’t matter, they’re the same thing and same treatment. I am even now on a lower dose of Risperdal than when I had psychosis NOS."
176100882,I didn’t flag anything. I don’t think I’ve ever flagged you.
176100883,Sorry _AT_MENTION_ .this is non of my business and if your doctor put that dosage its fine but 2.5 mg aripiprazole is not considerate medicating.i don t thing this could help anybody even the childs.but don t take me as mean person.i understand your struggle about med. ? just want to say good luck at your therapy
176100884,Sometimes i would like to think less.

176100886,"Yes, for a start our worst fears Funny how unique it is too!"

176100889,Yes. I’ll be talking to her next week. I just find it so annoying because I can’t rid myself of my past. Someday I’ll get so mad the bud will burst open and I’ll bloom. That’s what my therapist said.
176100890,Thank you sweet _AT_MENTION_ (((hugs)))) back to you
176100891,Every time I get overheated I have break through psychosis and panicking attacks. What the ????? Anyone else have this problem?
176100892,"Many times. The worst was when I was 18, and the police had brought someone else in. I pretended to take the pills, and when the pdoc turned away I spat them out at the back of his head (Wouldn’t do that now) They used the dozen or so officers to pin me down whilst they gave me a shot. I rugby tackled them all as they came in the doorway, and apparently one of them broke some ribs on a cupboard door. I must have spaced out or something, as the next day I was taken by a police _NAME_ to a forensic ward in the nearby city. It wasn’t until I went back after being sexually assaulted by a patient at the forensic ward that I was told I threw an armchair through a glass window to a room with people in it. Literally I still have no recollection of doing that. Not sure if it was the psychosis, or whatever it was they injected me with, but I went ??????? nuts some how."
176100893,For me one thing that helps is really looking after myself and positive morning affirmations.
176100894,"Never try to remember or analyze your dreams, you shouldn’t focus on them at all, they consume great amounts of energy, You have more positive subjects to think about, I had this lucid dreams when I was on lithium,"
176100895,They do indeed say that psychosis causes brain damage. Whether or not you choose to believe that is up to you…but I’ve seen seen multiple articles on this so that is what they say. The question of if meds cause brain damage is a little more up in the air. I’ve seen articles that say they do and I’ve seen articles/heard from professionals that say they protect the brain by stopping psychosis. So…I dunno. I don’t think anyone has all the answers at this point.
176100896,"Cheer up _AT_MENTION_, you’ll be fine. It takes times to heal."
176100897,I believe the best thing you can do to help yourself is to avoid sugar and processed foods. But I don’t listen to my own advise because apparently I’m an idiot.
176100898,My paranoïa is lessen by meds but is reactivated by social stress which occurred at a low level of social interactions. Sociability is one of my problems.
176100899,"When my world starts closing in on me, getting outdoors can really help to redirect me back into a reasonable state of mind. Staying inside my house seems to escalate my thinking in a downword spiral. Even going into my own backyard helps to distract me, there’s always a bug to chase, weeds to pull or a spot on the lawn that needs to be dug up to investigate…perhaps a nugget of gold in it? …hey I’m in Northern California- it’s possible! Whatever you can do to distract and redirect yourself until you can see your pdoc helps, and just may save your life…? Hope you can find something to help you, and be sure to go to your pdoc’s appt, Good luck until then."

176100902,No I don’t want to go to the hospital because I have day treatment outpatient program and it’s fun and similar to a hospital in a good way. It does get boring at home though.
176100903,Hang in there _AT_MENTION_ .
176100904,I don’t talk much because I don’t see many people. When do see people the amount I talk can vary quite a lot.

176100909,"_USER_ID_ _PERSON_ was in considerable pain after five spinal fusions to try to lessen pain. The doctors she saw were eager to give her opiods for pain relief. For years we were both on fairly high dosages of Antipsychotics. For years, we were also both heavy smokers with progressing COPD. Almost six years ago I went Nicotine free. _USER_ID_ _PERSON_ did not like the person I became the first two years while getting off Nicotine. She even asked me to go back to smoking, but this time for only a half pack a day, not what I had been smoking. Almost four years ago, she caught pneumonia and was hospitalized. Consequenly she is stopped smoking for nearly four years now. She is embarrassed to wear O2 everywhere we go. It is awkward. And her dependency on O2 has been increasing. Actually, our pulminologist refered us to the lung transplant people, with whom we have worked closely for the last many months getting ready to be listed for lung transplant. We have not actually gotten “listed”. Her lung dis
ease has taken a turn for the better at the same time she has gotten off opioids. _AT_MENTION_ Has suggested to me that these things are all related. It is good of ninjastar to try to help us. _PERSON_"
176100910,It sounds like you are getting taken for a ride. If you are lonely invest some money in a reputable dating site and you will hopefully meet someone. I wouldn’t settle for that everything happens for a reason mentality. If you say no that happens for a reason too.

Idk… Idk wat to think about synchronicity stuff… _NAME_ was really really into that and I respect him so idk… Alls I know is my ex ‘bf’ was obsessed with it… He convinced me to buy this book that’s called Angel numbers or something like that. But at the end of the day one can just enjoy coincidences and not take it too far. Cos then it gets exhausting.if taken too far. From my experience

I.e. slavery, anti-lgbt, oppression of women in certain religions. In Saudia Arabia a woman was punished for being raped. They stoned her. That was culturally acceptable, but that doesn’t make it right. I’m not judging _NAME_, I’m just saying he should educate himself about the dangers of prostitution and sex trafficking."

176100935,"Money is important and makes life easier. I don’t know what it is like to be wealthy though. I was homeless too - know how it is to be unable to eat and have no shelter. Money buys the basic necessities. However, I don’t think about being wealthy but being without debt. I worry more about debt than earning a lot of money. I live within my means and don’t buy anything with credit cards. I am so far doing ok. Some people earn a lot of money but spend more than they earn. This is not wise. The best approach is to live within your means and put some money away for savings. I don’t think I’ll ever be wealthy so I never worry about it- I can’t answer the question. I do worry about my future though, and I am working and saving for rainy days."
176100936,"I don’t think anything can prepare them for the reality. You can give them advice, but in the midst of an episode, with their adrenaline rushing in, they’ll forget everything and just run on instinct. Last year I had my first minor episode since meeting my husband. He panicked and lost track of me in the middle of a snowstorm when I ran outside in a t shirt. It was a pretty dangerous situation, but I survived, and he learned things. A lot of it is going to be trial and error."

176100947,"I think SSI has _USER_ID_ against the disabled. There’s no benefits for effort. I have tried and attempted many jobs and haven’t been able to gain an income, but I have tried very hard. I am going to start exercising every day. I walked for 15 minutes, but I feel better. I think not being able to save your SSI payments or become married is _USER_ID_ against people who cannot work. I believe every human being is a gift, regardless of what they are capable of doing or contributing, because life itself is a gift and existence is worth the experience. So if I am unable to set aside more than $2000 ever. What’s the point of SSI if you can’t put aside anything? I have had paranoid schizophrenia since the age of sixteen officially, It interrupted my high school and years of attempted college education. I have been bullied, stigmatized and harassed because of this illness my whole life. I only completed two years of high school. I have been fighting this stupid disease and aiming for the stars and 
now I feel conflicted about this SSI. My attorney believes I have a good case. I really want to work a job. I have so many ps and downs. One minute or day I’m depressed, the next paranoid, the next I feel fine. I go from one day to the next never feeling whole or complete. Having a job was supposed to complete me. Having security could complete me too. But if you can’t save more than 2000 that’s not security thats insecurity. They should definitely change that rule. Its messed up. If there’s a mortgage crisis and my family ends up homeless or the dollar crashes, or the stock market, it almost feels criminal! The idea that people who can’t work don’t end up starving on a street corner, how compassionate, lest they God forbid start a family or get married, or even try to buy a car! Let’s not give them enough money to ever be above the poverty threshold. Systems completely rigged against minorities, those with disabilities, and there’s too much racism in this country. I think Canada or Sweden wou
ld be a better place for me…money is evil. I would rather not have to use it at all. I do ok without spending, I have been taught to be frugal. My grandparents lived through the great depression, my great grandma was a teacher and an airplane mechanic for soldiers during WW2. She didn’t throw anything away. I don’t like the idea of getting money, but not being able to save it. The more you save, the more you can prevent debt/loss and financial ruin. If _PERSON_ changes this rule, he might have my vote in 2024. I also don’t think people should be spending their stimulus checks on bitcoin. I got my stimulus checks finally. I gave it to my dad to hold onto so I don’t spend it until I know what I should buy. I want to save toward a car, but that’s not enough to get a car that won’t be more work than its worth plus car payments and insurance. I also bought a laptop. This laptop is awesome! It’s the nicest thing I own. I just think with the economic peril of the nation, and uncertainty of our future

176100954,This. Exactly this. It is infuriating. Especially when I am talking about something important and my brain just stops. Then I have to awkwardly come back to it later or just forget it entirely. Makes me so mad. Sometimes I also forget how to do things I’ve done a million times. So frustrating.
176100955,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_. He needs to be in a ward. He should try another hospital, because he’s suicidal. _USER_ID_ is also a good resource.

176100965,That’s scary. I have had some scary ones too but you would laugh at my last one. I bought a bunch of Girl Scout cookies a few weeks ago but I couldn’t get the girls to take my money but they gave me the cookies. Later I went to look for them and I couldn’t find them. Either somebody stole my cookies or I hallucinated the whole thing. For some reason I seem to hallucinate children all the time. When I see kids in my house I didn’t invite in I go take my meds and go to bed.

176100974,"Oh yeah, I definitely agree that I’m burned out. And it’s been two months since I quit lol. That job was exhausting in every conceivable way (for me anyway; for other people it’d probably be nothing). Yeah, it’s not such a bad thing to be indecisive. I’m not going to rush myself. Ooh, that sounds pretty! Do you feel like you’re getting anything out of day treatment right now? I hope things look up for you! I think it’s good that you’re being proactive and getting treatment."
176100975,"I tried too quickly several times and caused myself and others loads of hurt. Over the last 2 years i withdrew very slowly from 2.5mg (regular dose) haldol to zero. Then went back to 0.5mg because i was in bad circumstances and my withdrawals and all the unprocessed emotions and thoughts coming up were too much to handle for me and people around me. I was on 0 to 0.5mg haldol the last year. I do have symptoms (anxiety, delusions) at times on this dose. I will focus on bringing my life and emotions in order before i try and withdraw again."
176100976,"That has never worked out for me, and yet I still feel that urge to try to make it without my med’s. The med’s weaken your body so much. They make it impossible to endure very much difficult weather. I can’t go backpacking because of that. I used to love to go backpacking. I can’t get jobs working outside, in the weather. It’s a question you have to answer yourself, with the help of your pdoc."

I can’t believe the obese and the morbidly obese are just doomed to being overweight their whole lives and nothing can be done for them. Because that would mean half of America is doomed to heart disease and strokes and diabetes and all the other conditions caused by obesity. It just doesn’t make sense. Does your health coverage cover going to a nutritionist or dietician? If so, I think seeing a professional might be helpful. I mean personally, I entered the board & care home three years ago weighing around 250 lbs. In four months I lost about 25 lbs. It was no special diet or anything. The home had a cook who came in and cooked three meals a day for us. It was a lot of variety but the trick was that he served us normal sized portions, he didn’t serve fatty food or greasy food, we had vegetables and fruit at every meal and we did not get any dessert. Three times a day we got a healthy snack and excep
t for meals, the kitchen was locked and closed so no access to food except what they gave us. My roommate lost about 20 lbs. But yeah, that just shows that eating healthy can result in weight loss."

I’ve learned in this book about a theory of schizophrenia that was common in America. So, after some doctors wanted to perform eugenics on schizophrenics, there came another theory that was more based in the nurture argument. They would place blame solely on the mother for the child schizophrenia, and later on many other mental illnesses. It was thought that the patient would get schizophrenia because the mother was being manipulative and trapping her child in tricks. The mother was called “schizophrenogenic”. And I can only imagine what’s next in the book."

174367716,"I haven’t had friends in awhile. My last roommate drove me crazy but we were kind of friends for a little while and that was a year ago. This might help you more: when I was in a board & care home from 1990-95 I made a friend there and we stayed friends for 7 years and not only that but he had paranoid schizophrenia too. I was in my thirties. My other longest friendship since I got diagnosed was in the eighties; I was friends with my neighbor and we both moved around several times separately but we were friends off and on for about 6 years. We lost touch in 1988 but we coincidentally both ended up in the same day program in 1998 and we picked up the friendship right where we left off and things went great though a lot of stuff had happened to us both in the years between. He was a mellow, friendly, likable guy and he also had paranoid schizophrenia. I haven’t had a lot of friends who were women. I knew a woman for a few years (also in the eighties) and we were friends, we even went out on two d
ates. And one of my sisters friends liked me when I lived with my sister in the nineties and my sister was always inviting me out with her friend. Yeah, she liked me and we were around each other a lot, I don’t know how good of friends we were. I knew her for a few years. I’ve had a bunch of short term friendships over the years where we would both be in the same programs or in the same housing and I met people at jobs. There’s a guy at work who I’m friends with I guess but it’s been 7 years and we’re only “work friends” but we’re getting sick of each other, lol. He’s not schizophrenic but he’s got mental health issues of his own."

174367719,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Recycling N-acetylcysteine: A review of evidence for adjunctive therapy in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Hall and _PERSON_, The mental health clinician , May 2019 All symptoms in schizophrenia may impact functioning. Although Food and Drug Administration-approved medications typically benefit positive symptoms, negative symptoms are generally refractory to medication interventions. N-acetylcysteine's (NAC) influence on glutamatergic neurotransmission has been established. An emerging body of research has attempted to correlate this action with reduction in symptom severity, evaluating response in positive, negative, and cognitive symptom domains.A literature review was performed to analyze available data on NAC intervention and improvement in the positive, negative, and cognitive symptom domains in patients with schizophrenia. Quality of evidence was systematically assessed to determine level of certainty in results.Three randomized controlled trials were identified. Across stu
dies, negative symptoms decreased more with NAC compared to placebo; ranging between 11.9% and 24.1%. The assessment determined a low level of certainty regarding benefit of NAC on negative and cognitive symptoms and moderate certainty for NAC regarding findings of side effects and lack of benefit on positive symptoms.Consistent reporting of benefit in negative symptoms is found across studies of NAC intervention. These improvements are notable for symptoms that have generally remained refractory to medication intervention. Inconsistent benefit was reported in positive and cognitive symptoms. GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation) assessment of current evidence indicates a low certainty of benefit for negative symptoms with standard use of NAC in patients with schizophrenia. However, a trial of this low-risk intervention may be warranted in patients with resistant negative symptoms and subsequent impaired functioning despite appropriate antipsychotic therapy as they may expe
rience additional benefit in this symptom domain."

I think it would have been better to take care of MH issues as they happened, but I probably wouldn’t have been as successful in college and work as I was. Today, there are so many flashbacks that I sometimes lose count. I’m glad my brain learned how to survive, but it’s difficult to have emotionally close relationships, for me.

176101031,"I made this account because that account is suspended. I may appear as a clumsy person, so I want to mention some things. Though I couldn’t learn the correct techniques, I won various swimming competitions, squash competitions, and was incredibly good at cricket. The only issue was I wasn’t learning the steps correctly. I was in the top 5 players in table tennis in my undergraduate institution. My only issue is that not being able to learn the steps means that one reaches a lid. So, there is more good news here. In fact I would have gotten in any Ivy League University based on Squash alone, but I was late in applying to the Universities. I sat for the SAT on stand-by after studying it for three days. This was because my move to the US was sudden and I didn’t complete my High School graduation. I applied after the 12th grade, while High School graduation happens after the 13th grade in the English system. In all my Math Examinations I held a near distinction, with 97 percentile in both Advance
d Mathematics and Mathematics at O Level. In the As Level exam I had barely given it 3 days of study and again made a 97th percentile. During all this period, I didn’t learn anything in the class room (inattentiveness) and couldn’t focus without adrenaline or fear of failure. Now my brain has reversed around 40 percent overall. I am using various (mixing works better) techniques to revive my brain. I can focus for 5,6 hours easily now and I flow. What is interesting is that ALL the deficits are concurrently reversing at an incredibly fast pace. I know that flow makes a person less neurotic, so it might be contributing to the rapid reversal in the Executive Functions as well. Here’s why this is happening: en.m.wikipedia.org Large scale brain networks Large scale brain networks are collections of widespread brain regions showing functional connectivity by statistical analysis of the fMRI BOLD signal or other signal fluctuations. An emerging paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive tasks are performed no
t by individual brain regions working in isolation, but by networks consisting of several discrete brain regions that are said to be ""functionally connected"" due to tightly coupled activity. Functional connectivity may be measured as long-r Th... The whole brain is connected in highly complex ways.

176101045,It depends on what other conditions you have. My eyes are too messed up to drive but I got a driver’s license when I was younger. I didn’t know a doctor had already told my Mom I couldn’t drive and she let me have it in order to appease me at the time and to have an ID with more status behind it. When I talked of getting an ID that would forever exclude me from driving my Mom indicated that I may need it for “emergencies” and gave the same lip service she used to give when she would lie to me about going to a Disability Driving Center to see if I could drive. The information she claims excludes me from is something she hasn’t been forthcoming about. That’s OK now because I no longer have the ability to read very well and my eyes are legitimately shot.

176101120,Sounds like you’re having a nice time. D&D is fun. I played it when I was young. I remember once the dungeon master asked me to roll against a barfite and I thought what a terrible beast that must be. I was so confuse as the melee went on only to find out it was a bar fight. lol.

I gained a pound back over a week not that long ago with no change in eating, I guess I was just retaining water or something. Maybe weighing every day works better for you if it helps you stay accountable. I normally don’t recommend it because a day is not enough time to actually lose significant weight, but if you prefer it, go for it! I used to have bulimia for ten years, so it’s a negative thing for me to jump on the scale everyday. That’s why I limit to once a week, that and I like to see a big number drop, so I wait to weigh in!"

176101136,I had an experience like this during my psychotic break. Try to distance yourself from giving it any credibility. Its just paranoia and delusions. Delusions are so tricky to sort out. You might be at a dosage that helps you with your current general symptoms but experience delusions still. I still experience delusions but they’re not persistent. I understand they’re delusions after a period of time and such. I recommend relaxing and if it bother’s you and you can’t control it.

I had fasted for 12 hours and I was ravenous and drove around and found a Chinese restaurant. I walked in and there were two women behind the counter and I kinda caught the eyes of one of the women, I had no problem with her of course and I gave her (what I thought) was a friendly look. But she acted like I hurt her feelings. And the other woman was giving her a consoling look. She got really subdued. I didn’t know what I did wrong. Both women were Chinese. They were both a little plump and both were cute, they almost looked like twins. I hate hurting peoples feelings a lot of the time and I know I was just a customer to them but I felt bad. But then when she waited on me and I started ordering she cheered up and started smiling and so did I and we joked around a little bit and she was really nice. And I thought 
either she had her feelings hurt by something totally unrelated to me or she read me totally wrong. But she fixed my food, a huge pile of chow mien and coconut shrimp and when she was dishing up my shrimp I laughed and told her I don’t usually get such fancy food and she put an extra piece of shrimp on, lol. And when the sister rang it up I told her I was just passing by but I was glad I stopped in. Everything ended great, everybody was smiling and happy, I found a spot and parked and ate my food.

174367751,"I didn’t mean every single case. The vast majority of people can handle societal pressures. Only around 7% of adults in the US have diagnosable depression, so obviously, most people won’t have any issues. However, many of us were easily stressed out and had stress-related mental health issues before out first psychotic episodes. What I’m getting at is the fact that, as schizophrenics and schizoaffectives combined make up less than 2% of the world’s population, then it’s clearly not just us struggling with stress. Yes, I agree that is an issue, so much so that I said it in my original post. My point is that, in many people, it can, and that it doesn’t mean that they’re faking (some people literally only have depression due to a vitamin D deficiency). Antidepressants aren’t like antipsychotics. They’re not meant to pull anyone back from the brink or keep people’s minds from imploding on themselves. They’re meant to ease certain neurotransmitters enough for sufferers to take part 
in treatment. Aside from some cases of eating disorders, psychotic disorders are the only psychiatric illnesses that can irreparably damage the brain, so of course a camping trip won’t fix it. Who does it make us look like attention seekers towards? Surely not psychiatrists, RN’s, or clinical psychologists, nor close family members and friends who observe substantial and very real deterioration in their loved ones, and most certainly not other sufferers who share and relate to our struggles. So who? I think we’re actually less likely to face disbelief from others because I really don’t think it’s possible to fake positive symptoms, especially disorganized ones, well enough to fool professionals or other sufferers. note: Sorry for the delay. I don’t think as quickly as I used to, and I’m really bad at typing."

At least I have art and writing as an outlet so I’m not completely alone in my support. But usually I pretend everything is fine when it’s not.

176101225,Even Jesus had 12 close friends… and even if you are prophetically gifted there is balance in broad teaching which comes from having wide range of people and information in your life. Voices should be background to the real people and things in your life otherwise they can consume a part of yourself that could otherwise be spent doing enjoyable things. There are 2.4 billion followers of Christ on the planet meaning you are one of many. Ask him to be kind to you. Perhaps bible study and learning his word would help balance out the voices from what his word says he is. It may also bring you closer to some knowledgeable Christians who can also help through prayer and fellowship.

176101249,I had a collection agency call me today wanting $2000 from me for an involuntary hospital committal 2 years ago. They held me for several months. I told them I’m not going to pay it because I was brought in involuntarily and when she put me on hold I hung up. I don’t think it’s right for them to hold me against my will and then expect me to pay for it out of my own pocket. Whatever they got out of insurance should be enough as far as I’m concerned. What do you think? Should I pay out $2000 or should I tell them to get lost?

176101263,I am beyond frustrated I finally started losing weight only to gain a few pounds back. This is the most aggravating thing I hate when my weight fluctuates from day to day if it would just stay the same or I could start losing again that would be awesome. I know I am hung up on my weight it hasn’t always been about my weight but now that I am heavier it is now. I hate it cause I work so hard at the gym to lose and don’t want any set backs at all especially when I came so far in losing the weight I have lost even if its just a few pounds gain it drives me nuts and I hate it. And also there are days when I wish I didn’t have any mental disorder at all I have pity parties sometimes I know most people could care less what Frustrates me and what makes me mad someone else may see as meaningless but I really don’t care what others feel or think I just know how I feel

I found them relaxing until I started fixating on whether people were wearing face masks or not rather than on the nice city scenes. As an aside, it’s interesting that the videos from Helsinki and Oslo showed most people wearing face masks, whereas the videos from Stockholm and Copenhagen showed most people were not wearing face masks. I should probably stick to nature videos since animals don’t wear face masks."

176101315,you’re not alone. i tried for years to work a full time high stress level job. as my symptoms worsened i needed more meds. that made me sedated and had absolutely no chance of being productive like the people i worked with. was let go by 6 jobs in 5 years. it’s definitely easier i think to work from home. no people around to make us anxious and paranoid. i’m on ssdi now. best of luck.

176101319,Ah ok I misunderstood because after that you put that it felt wrong to call yourself mentally ill. I have had that same feeling before too that I would rather my beliefs not be true because it is much scarier if they are real. Just another reason to seek treatment. Delusions can often be highly upsetting and stressful to deal with. So why would we want to keep such beliefs?Have you tried medication before? If not I highly recommend giving it a go. It can take a while to find the best med for you so don’t give up if you don’t find a good one right away.

176101325,"I don’t think it is suspicious. Most places will not sneak you more meds if you do not really need them as meds are costly. Ask them why this happened. It’s possible it was a mistake as others have mentioned. It’s also possible they felt you could benefit from a higher dose. If it’s the latter then imo they should have told you beforehand. Either way, they need to know that in the future you prefer to be informed of med changes before they are administered. That you do not feel comfortable with med changes that you have not yet discussed. I think that’s a reasonable ask. Communication will be very important in dealing with this."

176101356,"There was this guy in my neighborhood when I was growing up who everyone looked at as a kind of milquetoast. He was hopelessly inept at sports and games, and everyone looked at him like they were very glad they weren’t like him. He did dress nice, and he was good looking. But he was such a milquetoast. One time at a roller skating party sponsored by our school this girl held hands with him while they skated, and everyone was amazed that she would favor such a lack _NAME_ boy. One time I was on the teeter totter with him in the park, and I very mildly popped the board. I swear I didn’t mean for this to happen, but he went up in the air, fell forward, grabbed the teeter totter, and then rolled under the board, and let go, falling into the dirt. He was mad. He went straight home. I remember one time much later, in high school, a friend of mine and I were getting stoned, and he drove by, and both of us marveled that he could lead such a boring life. Now, all the kids who picked on this guy are drug
gies, alcoholics, and in the mental health system, and this guy is a respected accountant. I doubt if he has much sympathy for other people. He’s probably a staunch Republican."

174367800,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Current evidence of childhood traumatic experiences in psychosis - focus on gender differences. C _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research , Aug 2019 04 Childhood abuse is common among people with psychosis and it is associated with poor illness outcomes. Some forms of childhood abuse are more common in women, but the impact of gender and childhood abuse in psychosis has been little investigated and evidence has never been put into a congruent frame. Herein, we conducted a narrative review to assess the impact of gender and childhood abuse in psychosis. Research articles were identified (n?=?44) using a comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, Web-of-Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Women appeared to be at greater risk of sexual abuse than men. Women with childhood abuse report more positive and mood symptoms, and more suicide attempts compared to men. In addition, women exposed to childhood abuse display an earlier age of onset compared to not exposed, but t
his association is not present in men. Conversely, men with childhood abuse show more negative symptoms, substance use and a poorer cognitive performance compared to women. It seems therefore confirmed that gender and childhood abuse may impact on the outcome of psychosis, since not all gender differences found in patients who had been abused in their childhood are accounted by the overall differences between men and women with psychosis."

176101402,"I was shunned at school. I got quite a bit of the cold shoulder there. At first, the women were worse than the men. I’d be walking towards a door ahead of me, and the girl ahead of me would give the door a little fling shut. I got a lot of stuff like that. It seems like I got the kind of treatment I expected to get, but that could have just been that my perceptions changed. As for the women, with them there was the added element of sex/romance. People are a lot more sensitive to snubs when there is romantic competition going on. I think that if I had been female the girls would have been kinder to me."

176101431,"I have relentless thoughts that say unkind things about myself. Sometimes when it’s bad, my thoughts also spit out random sentences and words. It feels like I’m being attacked by my thoughts and I can’t make it stop. I feel like this must be on the voice hearing spectrum somehow, if there is such a thing. It’s like I’m just a few notches down from hearing this stuff out loud. It feels separate from my own thinking, if that makes any sense."
176101432,"At first yes, but then I realized for me it would never happen in my case and it’s too damn expensive for all parties. It was nice in the early years for me. It was like a resort where I loved being there and enjoyed it. Now, I realize it’s the source of my nightmares and hell. I don’t like Liberal policies really although they have good intentions, I think. People that break crimes, mentally ill or not, from my perspective, should not be sent to the hospital even temporarily. They should go to prison or jail. Those are my thoughts. We had some guy one time bring a knife to the hospital and he got caught. The screening wasn’t professional. One worker there said “knock knock, it’s the police” when he was doing my vitals. How ??????? professional is that? It triggered me. I think it brought back memories from college. Then the whole military uniforms/camo crap and then reading into things and thinking things. It spooked me and scared me. Then they had drug criminals there just hanging o
ut. One guy said “I’m thinking about going to school, not pushing drugs” so that just made me scared. Then the staring eyes and crap and them gathering around plotting against me, I guessed. One guy looked like he had a tazer or a knife. I don’t know about you guys but that freaked me out. You cannot trust heroin junkies – excuse my language. Then another guy said you become their ????? in prison for smoking their cigarettes. I heard constantly: “snitches get stiches” by these street people outpatient too. A lot of mentally ill people can be violent or have violent pasts/urges. This was in 2015 I think. I was hospitalized many times and was given adderall and had a bad reaction. They mixed the drug users/addicts with the regular mentally ill people and I wanted to LEAVE but they wouldn’t let me transfer to a safer hospital. Some were just street criminals… Crime is out of control and America is becoming a third world country given the crime and letting people out of prison. I guess that’s 
what they want and what’s going to happen. Then I started seeing some patients from the mental hospital hanging around the game center/internet cafe I went to like they were thinking I had money or something, which I don’t. I had a lot of close calls. Adderall made me paranoid for years and I started getting extremel paranoid starting in 2014 with my marijuana card usage and then my mom telling me some guy was looking for my uncle – back then. It freaking spooked me and scared me. Therapists were rude too. I guess everyone has a breaking point including them. A lot of these people had PTSD and were shifty/shady. Some were vets. Don’t get me wrong, I love and support our military, but it felt like all of life was converging to that point and I was going to die a horrible death. It’s a third rate hospital. I try to make sense of everything. Where the hospital was picking up random people off the street and getting them treatment but at the cost of my sanity and safety. Then I heard stories about the C
EO doing seances and rituals and crap there. I hate these people."

It’s a shame, as I thought I’d made some lasting friendships, but Schizophrenia sure does weed out those who’re genuine and those who’re not. Unfortunately I did not hide my psychosis after the first couple of episodes. Probably for the best, as I could have ended up doing something stupid. Guess you’re right - acceptance is liberating, as the insight you get from knowing you have Schizophrenia does help you sort your thoughts, and derail anything that seems crazy. I lose it sometimes, but much of the time I am able to function now much better than before. Just experience and knowing your triggers."

176101476,"CBD and Latuda can be safe or dangerous, it depends on how you consume it. CBD cannot be ingested while on Latuda. CBD inhibits the enzyme that metabolizes Latuda in the liver, this can lead to a dangerous increase of Latuda in your blood and in extreme situations death. However, you can take CBD sublingually or through vaping because that way it bypasses your digestive system (liver specifically). If you take it sublingually or vape it it gets absorbed directly into your blood stream, and these way are also a quicker way to feel its effects. So yes you can take CBD as long as you don’t swallow a capsule or gummy or whatever, just avoid getting it in your digestive system."

174367827,"I originally made this post as a comment in another thread I created, but I want to share it, if you guys would want to listen. Hey _AT_MENTION_ I remember you. Good to hear it is mostly over. To the rest of you in this thread, I liked hearing your guys’ journeys and where you are at now. As for myself I have been living with schizophrenia for about seven years, since I was 14 years old. I am twenty now. All during my severe refractory course of illness, I lived with either one of my abusive parents. I love them because I forgive them, but do not forget, so I will call a spade a spade when I say abusive. I went through some serious ????. I am also a dual diagnosis patient – comorbid substance use disorder – methamphetamine and opioids! That started several years after my diagnosis of sz, and I used to cope with trauma and painful emotions and experiences from sz, but it only made my illness worse. However, while spending the majority of my life under my parents’ roofs, I forever burned with 
an undying hope. And now that I am out of their houses, living with my significant other and best friend of 12 years, I am rebuilding my life and finally watching the seeds come up from the ground, set into motion so to speak. Now, because of a multitude of other factors (much of it being with the man I love in a supportive and stable environment) I am circling around a real, profound, and complete recovery. I have literally never been able to say this before, ever, but now I can say without a shard of doubt that I am living a life I want to live. I am content, happy, quietly joyful, whatever you may call it. If I could do the past over again, I would. Because I forgive the past. I now live and love vehemently, with no impasse. Sorry to wax triumphant, but to get to the details, I credit my recovery to a plethora of approaches. One, is the med piece. I got on Vraylar and then got down at just the minimum dose, and Suboxone at a low dose too (an opioid substitution/maintenance treatment to take away cravings & 
withdrawals / promote long-term abstinence), both in the morning. The Vraylar energizes me for the day, oddly enough, and so does the Suboxone. Vraylar I have found is a miracle antipsychotic for me, probably due to its mechanism of action, which never takes away my symptoms at the expense of my creativity and spirituality. I never thought I would find an antipsychotic that worked for me in that way, and so constantly struggled in my teenage years with med noncompliance. Later, during my addiction, I was incessantly at the whim of whatever ~Pharmakos~ was in my body, and whatever dose of the meds I had adjusted. I was so desperate for anything to change me. But then. . . I let the Universe change me. . . What I mean by that is the psychospiritual aspect of (my) recovery. I was completely unable to get sober from methamphetamine and morphine until I began to attend Dual Recovery Anonymous (first introduced to me in the psychiatric ward), Crystal Meth Anonymous, and Alcoholics Anonymous. I couldn’t just go to 
the meetings every once in a while, I had to work the Steps. A lot of people don’t know what that means and picture some vague objective and tasks-list that bestows sobriety. But the Steps are actually just principles of honest, willing, fearless (psycho)spiritual living that legitimately everyone can benefit from. It goes like this: you admit powerlessness, establish an understanding of a power greater than yourself, surrender to that power, search deep within yourself and confess your wrongs, sickness, and burdensome resentments and fears to that Power (mine is the Universe), to yourself, and to another human being, then willingly ask that Higher Power to remove those troubles, make amends with all who have been hurt by you OR have hurt you, begin to establish conscious contact with the Power through meditation/prayer, then having transformed oneself along spiritual lines, attempt to carry the message to those still suffering and help others in order to “forget yourself” or “step outside” of yours
elf. All in all, it’s a lot like any mystico-religious tradition, except wholly non-dogmatic / strictly theistic. It’s just a transformative and radically vulnerable way to live. (I also made so many amazing friends from the meetings.) If anyone here also has a drug / alcohol problem, I would highly suggest attending Dual Recovery Anonymous or just Alcoholics Anonymous (welcome to everyone, regardless of substance of choice). Anyway that was a huge piece in my recovery from schizophrenia because it allowed me a way to legitimately strive constantly toward a greater ideal of perfection. Another powerful building block approach to recovery for me was actually psychoanalysis. Sounds crazy, or at least quaint right? Well, actually, psychoanalysis in _NAME_-studied peer-reviewed research shows an incredibly effect size (efficacy) for the treatment of many forms of psychopathology including psychosis / thought disorder. I found CBT/DBT only productive up to a point, which is when I sought analysis to go much de
eper, under the covers, into the root of my problems. Because psychoanalysis, if you think about it, is radical. From its most basic theories, it is 100% trauma-informed. A lot of the qualms about psychoanalysis are because of actually wrong misunderstandings and simplifications of its ideas. I love it because, for one, it refuses to be pinned down as either a science, a medicine, or an art. And rightfully so, because the human mind cannot be pinned down strictly in biological terms either! I have been undergoing Lacanian analysis (which has been REALLY affordable for me), which specifically utilizes frameworks for treating psychosis in particular. In the treatment, I have found a “talking cure” that actually validates me, recognizes that my symptoms have meaning (even if it has to be decoded!) , that there are real, trauma-based reasons for my psychosis, that human relationships and connection are really our greatest healers, and that I have the authority and agency to direct my own life. And so that is 
what I am doing. My life right now is looking steeply up! This is not to say that I am not facing deeply sorrowful emotions head on, with no psychostimulant euphoric drugs to just numb/cover it up. I am truly, really living. I am in a totally new town with my best friend / partner (known each other for 12 years, since we were 9!), and I spent this week sending out applications for jobs [I have a guaranteed job at any Starbucks location but am trying to get a job at a nursing home to begin my career in nursing while going to school with the aim of moving up to psychiatric NP!]. I also got health and dental insurance coverage this week AND registered for classes at the community college here! (Rated best in the country…) I will be a Nursing major. My partner and I are planning to get an apartment here. I plan to get a Bachelor’s in Nursing, get a Master’s of Fine Arts in Poetry (I have several legit publications and awards, AND my debut book comes out in 2 WEEKS!), and go on to become a Psychiatric Nurse 
Practitioner, work toward post-graduate training and certification in Lacanian psychoanalysis at the San _NAME_ Lacan School Clinic (so that in private practice I can offer meds & therapy), and potentially go on to doctoral degree in neuroscience to do research and teach on neuropsychoanalysis. But yeah anyway that is what my life is looking like right now. I would actually say for the first time ever I am brushing up against total recovery. Now, I am accomplishing things occupationally, socially, spiritually. Partly because of the move, and the other factors I mentioned, including being on the right, consistent, minimalist med combo. But also it’s just happened this way, and I wouldn’t change a single thing. My life never had the genuine meaning that it did now, nor did it have its present wise pragmatism and stability. Just never before, not like this. I fully trust the abundance of the Universe and am brimming with wholly incommensurate gratitude toward It and my fellows, each of us tasked with communi
cating our own ineffable real, something which we often fall so short of, and of which our language and our sex (the junction of these being the mark of our humanity) seem always to be so devastatingly lacking. And yet sometimes, just sometimes, ???? just clicks and we are able to honestly and fearlessly say: “Holy ???? it is all worth it.” My best friend asked if I was happy last night at 3 AM. Not in passing, but in the context of deep probing for an authentic confession. I gave him my confession and said without any piece of doubt buried in me whatever that, yes, I truly do have joy. Anyway, thanks all for reading. Best & peace, HG"

176101598,"For the last few months I have been taking a amino acid complex and from the time I started I instantly felt better in my brain. I was having trouble with feeling irritated and uneasy in my brain, like the kind of feeling you have just before you get a headache. I was having this very often and things were kind of unbearable. I was thinking that if this feeling persitsts I will just be trapped in a annoyed state and my social life will be very limited as I with this irritation barely could put up with myself. I first discovered the benefits of amino acid complex by a accident. I was working out and took a amino acids after the workout as it is said to help build muscles. I always felt better after I trained. At first I assumed it was the training in itself. But then one day I started thinking maybe it was some of the supplements I took, so I experimented with taking amino acid complex every day, and that was it. I felt much better in head. I haven’t researched in extent what could be the possible 
link between taking AP’s and getting a good effect from taking amino acids, but I think it’s a fair guess that anti psychotics may deplete them from the body as well as possibly reducing their mechanism in the brain and/or absorption. I have researched and do know for a fact that anti-psychotics depletes Carnitine, which is one of the amino acids. Some other factors that may decrease the bodys uptake of amino acids are: Eating little unprocessed meats(Meat is the traditional source of amino acids) If you are vegetarian or vegan Having a bad digestion (diareah, bloating etc. If you have a bad digestion the body will have a much easier time to uptake amino acids from powdered supplements than from breaking down meats.) My experiences with types of amino acids: Initially I used to take 1gram capsules of amino acids after working out. Which did have a good effect, but it didn’t last long. I started feeling worse again the next day, so I have tried powdered amino acids to get a higher dose of typically about 
15-20 grams. At this dose it is actually enough for me to take it 2-3 times a week. Whey protein: I took this for a short time, but unfortunatley I got a allergic reaction. I actually developed haemorroids when I took it. These disappeared once I discontinued it. Pea protein: I am currently taking this. It is easy to take because it dissolves fully in water and it just has a slight yellow pea taste. I think it tastes good. And luckily I am not allergic to it. Less people will be allergic to pea than whey(which is based on cows milk). It almost has all the amino acids, but actually doesen’t have carnitine, so I am taking 500mg of this extra in capsule form. Pumpkin seed protein: I have also tried this which actually has all the amino acids. Unfortunately I think it is less suited because it is very rich in the amino acid tryptophan which is actually listed in my anti psychotic phamplet as having a moderate interaction with my AP. It is possible that it’s still suitable if you take it a long way off medicat
ion time. If you take it in the morning, there might not be any interaction if you take your meds at night. I am currently experimenting with this, but for now I consider pea protein my best option. Also Pumpkin seed powder doesen’t dissolve fully in water, so you kind of have to take a mouthfull of grainy _USER_ID_ and swallow it down. However it kind of tastes the way hot chocolate smells in my opinion, so the taste is ok.) There are also some other types that I have not tried, like Rice Protein. If you are experiencing the same symptoms I was with having physical discomforts in you head/brain, I would definitly recommend giving amino acids a try."

I have a new house and my goal is to do something in the house everyday. Being more social. I kind of lack in structure and initiative in social contacts, and to a lesser extent understanding. So i can easily feel deeply for someone, but find it hard to really show it in a consistent way that other people expect - like calling every week or taking the initiative to invite them for a coffee. I try to change that, but it is not a natural thing for me. I dont really know how to stay focused.

I feel fatigue and lack of motivation but I’m struggling to get through those problems. I’ve barely gotten started and I’m making slow progress, but in terms of timescale this has taken most of a year.

A reduced dose allowed me to feel and think again, but I don’t know if your symptoms are really stressful to you. You gotta really have a conversation and voice to the best of your abilities your concerns."

Many do but my ISP provided router does not so I use McAfee AV to block adult sites (and when I trying to sneak round it by looking on my iOS devices without McAfee I have enabled Screen Time content filtering on them). It means I have to purposely undo my work to get to those sites and can’t just aimlessly find myself on another adult site. I don’t feel bad about watching porn to get off but I do feel bad about wasting time searching. _USER_ID_: Sorry just saw that you have some apps to help block it. I hope they work for you.

BECAUSE As appears from the context of the research map,there is no an innovative idea that could lead to a revolution in the world of knowledge throughout the schizophrenia .

I made a post once about how I thought meds made me have thoughts towards transgender women and people got mad at me and I’m trying to come to different conclusions now Idk it’s hard to explain. But yeah I’ve only ever been interested in transgender women a little but that’s not all the time. Mostly I like girls. But my sexuality shifts slightly maybe one day every couple weeks where I’m in the mood for a different type of porn. But no i really like women just had bad luck with them. I have mental illness so I say stupid things but I’m not gay unless u think liking transgender porn once every now and then is gay. Then yeah I’m gay. But that’s what I am.

Cymbalta works great for some folks, lots less side effects than nortryptiline, and good for pain for some. not as good for sleep, though. nortryptiline was a HUGE weight gain med for me. Effexor was not, and was good for depression. it’s all a crap shoot. if you don’t have problems with BP, i’d try Effexor/Cymbalta (they’re similar) and a small dose of Tramadol for pain, but ask your doctor, of course."

I’ve tried like over 10 APs… Maybe the bloodtests could be cheaper or something or you could work somethng out. I don’t know. It’s an added cost and a large expense in my opinion. It could all be well worth it."
176101725,"I getcha. But when I need calories and don’t feel like eating, oatmeal is my go-to, lol."
174367887,Ever think of loweing the dose so that you experience some positives but have less negitives?
176101726,Will i end up in a forensic ward?
176101727,Hey _AT_MENTION_… I’m late onset. If you want to swap late onset chit chat pm me.
176101728,I am kind of fuzzy on what ‘perfect mental patient’ means other than lining up for meds and then letting them check to see if the meds were swallowed or not I am honest but not enough to not make my doc turn white or bright red again. I get nervous when their eyes get really big.
174367895,i feel like i also have this jimbob why dont you have a parent go with you or someone you know that always helps me. and no one is spyig on you its just the disease
174367890,"Maybe so. Not trying to promote Alcohol/illegal drug taking. Just saying that it had the same level of comfort escape from true emotions/feelings for a long time. Since I had delusions before I ever drank or smoked pot or anything I think I may be qualified to make observations on this more than a lot of other people who hadn’t experienced these things in the succession that I did Like lol when I’m lied to about drugs (and I still constantly am) it usually makes me wanna go self medicate A little. It’s a big trigger. The other day in iop I mentioned weed and she said “but weed makes depression so much worse”. Umm not for me. It is a mood booster for me but ok. I still am clean from weed But You are right that drugs helped my delusions Other people because of environmental /possibly genetic reasons sometimes don’t experience the same It sure was a great relief. However abilify, naltrexone, lexapro and low dose klonipin is mostly what I need. Thanks for being understanding"
176101729,I like the LoseIt! app. Its more user friendly then my fitness pal.
176101730,"thanks _AT_MENTION_ , wow you must have done a lot of research. well done. what’s cytokine expression mean? do you feel more symptom relief for being on these supplements?"

176101732,Definitely took some time to get better. It maybe took a month to tell the difference.
176101733,I’ve seen blonde on Asians. It looks pretty good. Vogue Hong Kong How to Dye Asian Hair Blonde How to dye Asian hair blonde - we’ve consulted Hong Kong’s top colourists and hair professionals to walk us through every step of the process
176101734,Facing people’s judgments I’ve always felt like: “yuck!” How quickly they would Call me “schnook” or “schmuck” !
176101735,If I can post here a question How do you get off the binge eating or hunger? I take resperdal 4mg
176101736,"I’m on 2 different meds. And I dont know why I ask the same question, I guess each day is a new experience and it makes me want to ask. I’m afraid for my life. The country is broadcasting me."
176101737,"My sleeping pattern, since I’m back from my vacation in poland, changed. I forget to turn off the tv when it’s late evening. Because of that I fall asleep for two or three hours and am awake between one or three o’clock in the morning. Should stop that. For that I go to sleep later in the morning after the nursing service gave me my medication."
176101738,"Yes, I’ve checked out a few near death experiences on line and on the bookshelf. The great majority of them are very peaceful and euphoric. I think about 90% of them are like this. Then, a few of them are really horrible. Some are a mixture of both. First they have a horrible experience, and then it turns into something beautiful beyond words. Lately I’ve been thinking that it might not be so bad to not exist."
176101739,"Yeah, they’re sharper, cleaner and #1 in my county."
176101740,"You are afraid to get kidnapped. Thats ok. I am afraid of other real things too. I got fcked in the ass as well, i felt it too. But i wouldn’t say it was rape, just an unusual experience. Sometimes i wake up and feel like i fell out of the garbage truck. I don’t know what is, just let it be, its going to be ok."
176101742,"I was speaking to my community nurse about having a MRI test yesterday and going to India. He said why don’t I ask the NHS to do one. If he was a real nurse he would know the NHS wouldn’t give me one as they say it would feed into the delusion. That’s why I KNOW he isn’t a real nurse but a secret agent, A real nurse wouldn’t say that. I told him that too. It’s hard to get MRI scan in Turkey, they asking loads of questions… Why would the NHS do it?"
176101743,"When you have money, the whole world is after it. Even those you like to think are closest to you. And it magnifies your paranoia a million times."
176101744,I asked my mom to let me die when I started to refuse food and water. I was very psychotic then though.
176101745,so you have no unusual beliefs now?
176101746,I wanna work full time and from home.
176101747,I’ve never had a girlfriend…and I’ve never kissed a girl. Also I have never been on a date before either. I’m 41 years old. Is anybody else in the same boat. be brave lol lol!!!
176101748,Im dead again. Its not depressing. Its actually liberating. I can do anything i want without consequence.
176101749,"I have a loose routine but i still struggle with hygiene. I shower like once a week and i don’t remember to brush my teeth every day, which sucks because I’m terrified of the dentist. I need to do better."
176101750,I think keeping secrets is more difficult than letting the truth be known. You can relax more when people know than if you are trying to hide it.
176101751,I used to have this kind of thoughts when I was more catholic.
176101752,"Seriously _AT_MENTION_, you should utilize these crisis lines. You need help."
176101753,I’l l make a thread and we can post the little things we do each day. All it takes is making a 5 minute commitment.
176101754,well god said before u were born he formed u in d womb
176101755,I wouldn’t dare tell my boss I run out of work to do. He would give me more cases. I already have 70 of them. As soon as you close some you just get more.
176101756,Yes I’m on abilify. It raised my blood sugar levels and I have to take Metformin for that.
176101757,Is that the new antpsychotic with Zyprexa and another chemical that blocks weight gain? I wonder if that chemical works with other antipsychotics like my Risperdal…
176101758,"Wow, they are gorgeous."
176101759,"I haven’t tried L dopa but tried L tyrsone and it raised heart rate, raised anxiety etc not good for general well being. Another thing is it raises thyroid hormones and giving hyperthyroid like symptoms. Safe alternative for raising cortisol alone is caffeine from coffee or strong tea. Anyway its better to have have low cortisol as too much of it can cause various issues."
176101760,9 years here. I just manage. I’m moderate functioning but I feel really low a lot of the times.
176101761,I worked in sales and had a lot of direct contact with customers. It would be impossible for me to work the hours or deal with people now. I wish I could.
176101762,"They need to stop obsessing about people who are the opposite of them and would never want to be anything like them in a million years, in their worst nightmare. They know they’re making up for a lower IQ by torturing people."
174367910,On Abilify I didn’t have negative symptoms and no irritability. Now on Risperdal my negative symptoms are making me irritable and angry. Its like if I am blaming ppl for my negative symptoms. Its not as bad as without meds but it can get better. I am fighting with my family more intensely and more often since stopping Abilify. It sucks.
176101763,Nice post! Welcome to the forum !
176101764,"I had racing thoughts, off the charts, almost drove me mad, when i was off meds"
176101765,Nah dude. Just no.
176101766,imaginary for sure and definitely do not fight with them just would scare them more.
176101767,"The thing with quitting meds is that you will get worse than before taking them. The brain adapts to them and you get withdrawal psychosis from stopping. I quit my meds for a year, I was paranoid, delusional and was hallucinating. I ended up in the emergency from poison suicide attempt and then transfered to mental hospital. For me, I would rather be on meds than dying."
176101768,Maybe not a psychopath but definitely abusive.
176101769,I already have a tombstone plaque. It says: Pray for me.
176101770,Good for you _AT_MENTION_ . You’ve got this
176101771,"Cyber Torture is not CIA or _PERSON_ related, though nice try mate."
176101772,I heard CBd interacts with antipsychotics.
174367894,"I understand. Well it’s hard to tell for the person who it regards. When I have got sick after quitting meds I have been unable to understand that I was delusional before I got help. But it is different for everyone. I’m not going to discourage you. Nothing is better than if you can make it without meds, and it is better to find out while you are young than later in some regards. Basically I think you should tell your doctor what you tell us (in so many words) and let him decide. He is the only one that REALLY knows your situation."
174367899,"I have taken Amisulpride for 2 years, and it basically got rid of 99% of my positive symptoms. Been on 6 different AP’s. This one is the best for me so far. My prolactin is three times higher than high range number, but benefits outweigh risk according to the doctor. I am hopeful it will work well for years to come."
174367913,In my case of schizophrenia it was low gaba that caused it i tried 4 antypsichotics and non of them worked untill I was on aripiprazol 60 mg a day and I told the doctor can we add some thing else that will help get rid of my symptoms and he said yes we will give you valproic acid or valproate it’s the same from the 2nd or 3rd day I notice the voices went away and the thought broadcasting eased a bit also it took about two and a half months when I noticed I was just tripping out the whole time valproic acid increases gaba in the brain and betters it’s receptors so thats what causes it also supplementing with amino acids can make it even better but I suggest valproic acid number one I take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night Im telling you that’s the cure…good luck
176101773,"Well let’s see. I’m very anxious all the time, even when I’m just sitting at home doing nothing. It’s like it’s coming to get me. I don’t know why. When I have to go out to the store I nearly panic. Dealing with my daughter in all this mess is giving me a stroke I swear. I’m not going through a meds change but my pdoc is increasing one of my meds so that’s been something to deal with too. I don’t know, I’m not handling it very well I guess on one hand but as good as can be expected I guess. I just keep trying to remember it’s the whole world that’s dealing with this trauma right now. We all need to be as strong as we can be for each other."
176101774,I am on wenlafaxine and Amisulpride.
176101775,I hope to keep my job. I sent an email in violation of my companies privacy act policy today and big brother was watching. I got an email saying it was blocked and not sent and in violation Later my manager emailed me the warning and said “we will discuss” He hasn’t talked to me about it yet. Hopefully I don’t get in too much trouble. We have to fax everything to and from our clients. That’s so archaic with scanners these days but that’s our policy.
176101777,"So I called my psychiatrist and he told me to up the dose so that the depression will be more under control. I told him that I have not had any hallucinations or delusions recently, and that hallucinations haven’t been occurring for a month. He told me that as it is with psychotic depression people with it tend to go on long remissions with psychosis occurring once in a while. While I am under control of psychosis, my depression has been going through the roof. I’m glad that I have a chance to control this horrible depression and low self-esteem."
176101778,I’m praying for her family and their quick recovery after a heart felt grieving process. Time heals all wounds. I’m sorry for your loss. Honest.
176101779,"Be sweet and be genuine, and hope it comes through. There are a lot of fakers and it’s hard to spot real people with good motives. Also don’t be pushy, that’s scary."
176101780,"The last time I got my blood work done, all my levels were excellent, despite my size. I have become less worried about my size and more on keeping those levels good. I’m proud of myself."
176101781,I think the moon opened up my mind and helped me see things only she could have known.
174367906,"I’ve never heard voices, but I’m feeling pretty chilled. I’ve been suppressing my unusual beliefs, I no longer ‘enjoy’ them. In fact, I’m a bit appalled by them. But I’m still in denial of my diagnosis although I consider that a lost battle and won’t be insisting on it. At worst, I am sick, but my case is very mild. It shocks me to hear that to you get all those positive symptoms even on medication, it can’t be easy."
176101782,Can you try to explain?
176101783,Thanks! Me too!!!
176101784,"That was my thought too. What kind of therapist says “yeah you know if you don’t think you have a mental health issue then don’t come back, why take your meds?” Like um… am I the right person to be the judge of that?! And he said the questions were rhetorical but the damage has been done."
176101785,I am wondering if taking testosterone will improve energy and sex drive while on Risperdal.
176101786,bumped in to old friend from 1994…we’re both 43 now…we made small talk and then he asked me what I aws doing with myself…I told him I had sz and that I attend a mental health club…we chatted a bit but then afterwards (whenhe had gone) I said I should have told him something interesting about sz but what can you say…how would you describe sz to some normie…and how would you make it sound interesting
176101787,i dont have my ipad anymore so i draw on wacom tablet. its hard here to be precise
176101788,"I have been on it for 5 years, not for depression just for sleeping and gaining weight. I used to sleep 12 hours on it (2 more than normally) and it made me hungry."
176101789,whats the injections gonna do to me so different? its the same meds
176101790,We actually we leaves those king _NAME_… _NAME_ get hibilly. You can call one ????? .I’ll.be able to slap theirasses
176101791,I think you need to stop making these posts public.
176101792,its a disabled parking badge which is now available for people with mental disabilities in the uk
174367911,"Yes. Either my meds or my sza illness or both make me isolate and withdraw a lot and spend a lot of time alone. I don’t spend a lot of time trying to reach out and make friends and every time I do reach out and try to make a friend, I fall flat on my face so, I don’t try very much at all as a consequence."
176101793,I asked her her phone number.
176101794,"Oh, that’s interesting. I’ve always been jealous of the NHS, I think it’s a great example of good health care. I didn’t know how far it extended into mental health though. I would have hoped it would have more resources I guess. Medicare here covers 80% and you can get Medicaid or Medi-Cal depending on where you live to help with the rest, and I only get that because I qualified for federal disability which was a two year process. I got very lucky and got qualified on my first attempt without hiring a lawyer."
176101795,I thought about this for a while before I voted. So long as she respects your desire not to get into psychic stuff then it sounds like she could be good for you. So I voted yes.
176101796,I heard some weird sounds that the voices associated with me developing brain cancer… According to my delusion mind… The voice was like hei I need to kill u cos we got a portal thing connecting us and the brain cancer is gonna spread to him. And he was like a universal god of some kind so he wasn’t allowed to die. All very traumatic.
176101797,This is one of my favorites of what you’ve written. Quite profound. Nice work.
176101798,"Just used a little green clean machine. I have one and it really works well. They’re like 30 bucks, i think"
176101799,"It’s good you messaged your doctor about it. Your meds should not do it to you, so maybe there’s a need to change the brand."
176101800,Well good luck _AT_MENTION_ .
176101801,What??? So if my nose wasn’t chronically blocked I wouldn’t get psychosis? So my sza is due to my nose???
176101802,I have a real problem with this question… This question is like if someone walked up to me after my ex beat me and asked that question… I would say now yes after he beat me! This question is like saying it’s okay for someone to be mentally or physically abusive to their partner as long as they show love after
176101803,"Mine has been constant for years that i dont necessarily believe but i cant shake the thought and it makes me close my eyes. But its related to shame i think, when im doing something private ill get the thought that someone can “see” through my eyes like a television. Usually this person is the last person i had an argument with or someone i really look up to."
176101804,I’m so sorry. I know you’re devastated. Will you get an urn?
176101805,I know. Makes sense but politics peeps. Someone may be offended and we all know site policy.
174367915,I have tried abilify previously years ago and it made me manic and it made symptoms worse. This time different doctor said lithium should help so I tried it again. Works for the most part. Still some symptoms

176101808,Ooooo cool
176101809,"Amiga 1200 for sure. We had no toys as kids, I mean me and my brother. The first thing we got was a super nintendo with starfox as first thing to add in our room. But I’d like the Amiga 1200 way more than a console. Espacially, my father bought it just for myself. Starfox was the first game I’ve ever played through."
176101810,I talk out loud sometimes when I get into a certain negative thought set. It’s always swearing and it’s usually degrading to me. I swear like _NAME_ your a dickhead or other things. I don’t do it in public and it’s a way my mind thinks sometimes when I am thinking too much negatively. It’s annoying as hell and I’ve never done it in public thank the stars!
176101811,"Do you have any posts you want deleted before being anonymized? If so, go ahead and flag them."
176101812,Habits? I have no habits? I’m never on here? Never!!!
176101813,I was on Latuda. It gave me akasthsia though after 18 months. I ended up on Haloperidol but that gave me movement problems and now I am settled on Amisulpride. I have tried 6 meds so far
176101814,No was a video I received on WhatsApp
176101815,I meant my mom not my old pdoc Since I used to fear my dad and it only stopped when he died
174367908,I would read up on positive and negative symptoms and get familiar with them.
176101816,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176101817,yes its very scary here in Greece no cases yet.
176101818,Oh! That could be helpful for my Haldol for sure. I also need supervision with my adderall though.
176101819,I have suicidal thoughts through out the day. I was wondering if it might be a certain med I’m taking. I take both an antidepressant and ap.
176101820,What a group of greedy people! Glad you encountered a good one. Lucky guy.
176101821,"I just read this entire post, and I cannot believe what you folks have been through. I am in tears If you can find the courage to crawl out of bed every day, surely I have no right complaining about my piddly ass problems"
176101822,I wake up at least once or twice every night due to hunger. Or Idk what…
176101823,Are you getting any sleep _AT_MENTION_ ? Seems like just 2 or 3 hours ago you posted that it was 4am and you were going to bed and now you are back on the forum . Do you have insomnia or something? I’ve been on far to long myself but I’ve been switching back and forth between the forum and news. It’s 1am here.
176101824,California I think it’s somewhere in the middle or north of the state there’s just a lot of techie people working there and they all take tiny doses of lsd and mushrooms and go to work because they think it increases productivity and creativity Tell me if I’m wrong _AT_MENTION_
176101825,It is strange i think…i was quited messed up (frightened) at the time…but this didnt help me become less afraid. I fled multiple times out of fear.
176101826,Risperidone worked. I’m switching to geodon.
176101827,I have major self confidence problem. I used to be confident when I was young about being good in school but I dont think I am even that anymore. Apparently that is a social anxiety problem not sz though.
176101828,"I was scared of pleasuring myself. The first time I ever masturb8ed, I was 12 and in the shower. I nearly collapsed from the orgasm."
176101829,You lied? Most people that have delusions don’t believe they are delusional. Telling the truth is what gets them the status.
176101830,so can it go away with treatment/ medicine
176101831,"Taking meds is part of sz. If Abilify didn’t help you, nothing can. Abilify is best for negative and cognitive symptoms."
176101832,"_AT_MENTION_ Are you part of Anonymous? This reminds me of the “Storm Area 51, they cant stop all of us” group."
174367922,"I haven’t tried clozapine, but I know Risperdal is really sedating. When I was on Risperdal I used to sleep for 14 hours and I didn’t sleep more hours because I had to go to work."
176101833,"That is interesting, since AP can cause or exacerbate OCD."
176101834,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176101835,I struggle like that too. Call your dr to see if you can get a new med or a higher dose. It might help you
176101836,I’m having to self quarantine for the next 14 days. I have no symptoms just the unfortunate one to take someone in with possible infection. Anyone else in this position? Anyone have plans to keep busy with?
176101837,"Nice ! I’ve only had a beer/glass of wine or 2 whilst on APs. I didnt really like it as it made me sluggish and anxious. But everyone’s different. Although alcohol is considered a no-no for those on APs; I dont think a glass of red wine will hurt, so as long as you limit yourself."
176101838,I don’t even want to think about it. I just want a week of stability first.
176101839,? like people.if you have enough mental health and capacity you realise that they all like you.they all have struggles happiness etc.all controversy and opposition is mostly about wrong perceptions and misunderstandings and in our cases paranoias and delusions.but in general our consciousness are all same.
176101840,"I hope you’re not like me. I had to be threatened by my parents to tell cops that I threatened my brother with a knif. Its then that I accepted to take meds. My parents now say that they will kick me out of the house if I stop my meds again and I can’t even live on my own, I have spending issues with money. The earlier you accept taking meds the better bcz risks are too big without meds, kill or be shot by cops. Once cops yelled at me to sit still bcz I was being verbally aggressive toward my parents infront of the cops."
176101841,What you describe is for a pdoc to unscramble.
176101842,Hmmm interesting. I don’t know what freedom you heard off but here comedians are being jailed for cracking jokes on govts and religion…
176101843,Aww I hope you enjoy it
176101844,I don’t like anti Parkinson’s medication as it is too stimulating for me. Sometimes they cause me confusions which becomes a panic attack.
176101845,Happy birthday!
176101846,"I like the sounds of that. I’ll give it a try whenever I find myself staring at a wall for too long, set the timer and read or something."
176101847,"merry christmas to you too, _NAME_ =)"
174367926,"Religious delusions almost killed me twice. I wish I could isolate myself from religion as it kills me for real. Its good here on the forum that religion is banned but I wish it would be the same in real life. My parents keep talking to me about religion and miracles and that miracles can cure mental illness. If there was no religion there would be less schizophrenia in the world. My parents wanted me to stop my meds and exorcise me. It scared the ???? out of me, I will end up killing ppl or myself if that happens as I am like that without meds."
174367916,My Doctor suggested Clozapine and told me I would need weekly blood tests. I declined.
174367933,Risperidone is a good choice. Saved my life
176101848,That’s because the meds are working and helping it
176101849,That simple because smokers are smoking tobacco leaves that are natural doesn’t mean it is a safer option.
176101850,My car’s accelerator is into being dominated. It wants me to mash it down to the floor with my foot and hold it there.
176101851,I have one but haven’t used it in 20-25 years. My parents begrudgingly let me have one to appease me but never let me drive their car beyond the experience of learning to drive just enough to get one. Then they never let me drive again. My father let me drive his car in North _USER_ID_ one time when I visited but I just drove around for a few hours. Many excuses were given by my Mom for why I wasn’t driving until she broke down and told me I had an eye problem and that a doctor suggested I never drive. At this point in my life I actually agree my eyes are that bad. I wasn’t so sure years ago. The license did make a nice ID.

176101854,You should go to the hospital i think. Because only eating 200 calories in a week is the same as being gravely disabled because you can’t take care of yourself.
176101855,I have about half a dozen I catch up with regularly. Going up for lunch this week so will catch up with 3. I saw another who dropped around on Saturday. I’ve known these peeps since highschool.
176101856,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ i will text her. Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176101857,"my parents would never do this for me, thank God for you. Much love. I think like the others said on here, withdrawn and negatives. Invite him to come here, if he wants to engage."
176101858,I like paliperidone. I took it 8 months.
176101859,Music always helps me. When voices are too much it drowns them out.
176101860,It’s probably the meds
176101861,My memory is definitely diminished.
174367920,"No, I stayed in hotels then in student housing. I just went to german school for 1-2 weeks and stopped bcz of negative symptoms and I was unmedicated for 1-2 years. I paid for 4 months, stayed 3 months in the student housing."
176101862,o i see thats cool
176101863,Thanks! _AT_MENTION_
176101864,"Can you call your pdoc? My pdoc answers or gets back to us within a couple of hours no matter what day of the week or time it is. They can guide you on what to do, whether you just need a prn or an increase in meds, or whether or not you should go inpatient. If you can’t get ahold of your pdoc or nurse practitioner over the weekend, then go to the ER. Don’t wait until it gets worse and you lose insight or drive. Plus, the worse your condition, the longer your hospital stay. Best to get in, get meds adjusted, and get out. Sometimes, if it’s just a small adjustment, they’ll let you go home after the required 72 hours."
176101865,That’s not how it works. Needing it at all suggests that you have sz. Each person’s body metabolizes each medication differently. Some people here are on like 2mg of haldol. Doesn’t mean that they’re not sz.
176101866,I go for walks sometimes.
176101867,_AT_MENTION_ do you have any problems getting up in the morning? I need to find a way to quit my coffee consumption to possibly reduce my voices
176101868,I withdrew from klonopin twice. The first time it was intolerable. The second time I was on 5mg risperidone and I got no withdrawl symptoms! The only reason I took it again is due to other very awful med problems that were sending me to the ER. You can try benzobuddies.com
176101869,Wow _AT_MENTION_ ! Thank you!
176101870,"No, it was in control after antipsychotic injections and olanzapine tablets."
176101871,Stopping meds never ends well
176101872,"Put fragrance in my hand lotion. I smell purty, like pumpkin pie. Played some piano. Drinking a pumpkin flavored beverage."
176101873,"I felt like it wasn’t working enough, and I was hoping maybe there would be something better. I was on max dose of invega and I was still having symptoms. Plus, it raised my Prolactin levels very high, so the doctors found it an overall good idea to switch."
176101874,I’m not going to lie. I’ve been saving up for it. I’m hoping the one with less memory gets released in U.S.
176101875,"In addition, with the sz diagnosis I feel like it implies that the person has little or no integrity. People will not simply believe what a sz person says as it is likely delusional. For example, I was talking to a psych nurse about how dogs can smell through deep water like a loch or a lake and pick up the smell of dead bodies if trained to pick up that scent. (I saw it on a TV program and thought it was amazing and they showed a trained dog pick up a scent off a boat rowed out in a lake.) There was no way in hell the nurse believed me due to my diagnosis, and as I have no integrity I feel doubted in every sense. I know it seems trivial, but to me if you have no integrity I feel less of a person. A person with depression is seen as sad, but they still have their integrity, which is why a sz cannot ever be a trendy illness."
176101876,"I am OK with the pills, taking 6 mg before bed. Helps me sleep and takes care of what little symptoms I have left."
176101877,but why is that cause i do the same.is it because from sideffects.i wish they can invent something better in the future
176101878,"Sorry to hear that _AT_MENTION_ . Hard pill to swallow, not having motivation. I don’t hate myself. I like me. I do get discouraged though. I just don’t like the changes or limits."
176101879,Thanks for the info man Ill check in with the GP
176101880,Walk my brothers dogs. Volunteer work. Shave and bath.
176101881,i always felt like a freak cause i often teeter on the edges of delusion. like why can’t i be a normal schizo? i guess on the bright side is i’m pretty high functioning and have some insight
176101882,"pretty sure there both natural, but they look good right."
176101883,"Dementia sucks more than sz, you loose everything."
176101884,"I mean maybe I really should make my peace with the fact, that the meds work on me on something like 60 %? My ex pdoc said to stop switching, we tried this hard really…"
176101885,Yes it’s nice to have that cultural connection with you and _AT_MENTION_
176101886,Case study for _NAME_. Its cool to see the case studies cuz its literally stuff people on the forum have dealt with. Backstory 20201219_1347353120×4160 1.79 MB Analysis 20201219_1348253120×4160 1.99 MB
176101887,"I feel tired but I can think. If the dose is too high all I can do is sleep. But if I tell my pdoc that, she lowers the dose for me. I recently started taking less loxapine in the morning so I can stay awake during the day, but I still take the full dose at night and that helps."
176101888,"Hi. Welcome back to the community! Your psychiatrist is right. 2.5 ability doesn’t do anything for hallucinations or delusions. Going off meds is always a gamble, but it sounds like your doctors have been doing it in as low-risk a way as possible. There are always a few lucky ones who can go off meds and stay stable. Make sure you still go to appointments and therapy though, so your doctors can monitor you. If you show signs of relapse, they can put you back on meds. The downside is, if you do relapse, you’re less likely to respond to your original dose, and may need a higher dose or a different medication."
176101889,There’s a special place in my heart for single parents. I wish my mother had had the courage. The closest she got to that was writing a letter to her husband about separating and then she never sent it.
176101890,Meditate for 5 minutes straight
174367927,thanks I’m still adjusting to being off 5 of my meds. The clozapine is so powerful that it took all of my other medications place. The low dose is working so far though
176101891,You sound extremely delusional
176101892,i’m glad i don’t get lonely too much. i live with my parents and rarely see people outside of that household. Sometimes mobile team girl comes to get me out for a walk but she is preggers now and i think i won’t see her a lot for a while as she been sick cause of the pregnancy.
174367929,"Abilify was the first med they put me on when I was 16, it made me really tired, but that’s when my tactile hallucination dreams started, and then I took myself off it for 3 weeks because I thought I changed from it. Ask your pdoc if you can get a more sedating med"
174367938,I had a friend who smoked weed every few hours and he never gets paranoid. I had to leave him bcz he kept giving me puffs and smoking it in my car eventhough I told him its making me paranoid and violent. Its legal here.

176101894,"I was on risperdal and had some serious side effects (although I do like my A cup boobs since I am trans). Do they test you to see if you are taking them? If they tell me I have to go back to APs, I think I am just going to ask for a shot and be done. I’m dreading my next appointment. I just know I’m going to get led to a room, told to drop my pants and have a sore rear for a few weeks."

176101901,I take a shower once every two weeks although this time its been like a month
176101902,they suggested botox injections in my eye muscles i said hell no
176101903,"That’s paranoia. The doctors aren’t trying to deceive you, they are trying to help you. I’m sorry you have to go through this, but we all suffer at one time or another. I can only tell you what I see and hear. I can see objectively that you are delusional and need help and that your thinking is faulty. Part of your illness is that you can’t see this yourself."
176101904,"There’s new people all the time. I get along with most of them. Today I insulted a new woman soldier somehow. I don’t know what I did but I had my back to her as I vacuumed and I could hear her slamming her belongings behind me in her new office as I vacuumed it. When I was finished, I looked at her and she was looking at me very pissed off. I said, “Wow, you really look mad” That seemed to placate her, and she looked friendlier. I think she must have thought I was ignoring her."
176101905,"Give it a couple of hours after my injection - and seem to get my “insight” back - Usually tired but alot calmer. Had mine late tho, and the Seraqoul at night wasnt cutting it. Been particulary moody this week, and got to apologise to a few people! Was meant to goto a clinic for respite for 2 weeks - was all packed - but the bed was needed - so it never happened, i wasnt “ill enough” to _USER_ID_ the bed when they had a shortage. So that didnt improve my mood either. EUPD is the new name for BPD. That was my diagnosis since 17, until they decided i was _PERSON_ as well 5 years ago."

176101913,"I thought an alternate universe was breaking through into ours but it was coming through bugs first. I was seeing a lot of bugs. I was certain they were all in the walls of my house because there was also a lady who talked to me from my walls. This led me to cut holes in the ceiling to see if bugs came out. They did not. I also slept in the living room for a long time because there was a shadow man in my closet. So, not too much outwardly weird stuff."
174367930,I have the perception that the negative symptoms have become much worse for a lot of us over the last 6 months. Do you think that is true?
176101914,Hey this makes me feel better. I do like my video games.

176101916,I’m 40 and my boyfriend was 43. Sitting around being depressed and not leaving the house cost me so much precious time him!
176101917,"This means a lot of different things to a lot of people. Whatever way you look at it, life is hard and there are winners and losers and those who sit in a grey area.

176101918,I experience this aswell! All of what you are saying sounds like I could of wrote it. Love the replies as I’m not in that’s state of mind at the moment and are eventually starting meds very soon. The voices are crazy but so am I
176101919,"Since about January, I have isolated an insane amount- even from my family. I talk to my sister, mom, and dad on the phone, but I don’t even go downstairs to spend time with my kids anymore. They are always busy playing on the computer anyways, or my son is at work. So I isolate. I feel very alone, and very unhappy. I’m now quite out of shape from sitting in bed, and everything is such a mess that I don’t even know where to start to fix it or how."

176101925,I told you before _AT_MENTION_ Stopping metoprolol abruptly can cause your heart to race uncontrollably or even worse cause a heart attack! Go pick up more meds now.
176101926,I would define my episodes as believing the things in my mind are real. I know my hallucinations are just hallucinations. Sometimes it’s harder to deal with delusional thinking and i have a little bit of paranoia but i recognize that it isn’t real. As long as i can maintain the fact that it’s all in my head then i’m fine. Right now i’m dealing with intrusive thoughts from OCD. It would be a lot easier to deal with if i didn’t hallucinate. The hallucinations repeat what my intrusive thoughts are and then they get mad at me when i do have an intrusive thought. The best thing for me is to ignore them.
176101927,Yeah totally cool. I was a dick and didn’t realize till later what was up. My bad.
174367935,So this friend I have been talking to online for a while good conversation and all. It’s great pass time talking to him. Well I decided to tell him I’m schizophrenic just to see how a person who likes me would take it and he immediately said how would I feel if he stopped talking to me. Damn it’s a cold world out here. Guess I have to get use to people I talk to and or date leaving because I’m schizophrenic. Lonely world be schizophrenic.

It’s understandable if you don’t want to do that but life kinda sucks when there’s no family around and nieces and nephews are difficult to keep in your orbit. Also many of us had normal parents.

I’ve been sleeping too much but other than that you wouldn’t be able to tell that I actually have such a severe mental illness. I was actually doing and living a very different life before my diagnosis and was very suddenly thrust into this world that took some time getting used to.

176102065,"Honestly, you’re wasting time and your life away by thinking of these things and feeling important. You should be doing things like moving forward with your life so you can have a family, work, and go to school, and take care of yourself, your house, hygiene, chores, bills, etc. If you cannot do those, then you’re not really recovered or better. Spending hours thinking about these things is detrimental to your health. I realized that too. I have improved over the years but I still struggle with intense, intense OCD like thinking about simulation theory and damn reality like every day. Instead of every second of the day, it’s only a few times a day on average now. I feel like I’m psychic and seen the news on simulation theory in the future (my past life) and even escaped the simulation (like the billionaires are trying to do) and even ran some of it for a while (what aliens do). There’s no proof and it makes me feel important and special, but I know I’m expendable and just a lab rat in t
he grand scheme of things and no better than an ant to these ??????? demons. I honestly just want some money, some women, and some work and education. The whole 9 yards. The whole eating healthy, getting into shape, etc. I don’t need to be crazy rich, but I want more for my life. I thought about some positive things like starting a non-profit teaching homeless people or vets to program computers, but my dad said I need to help myself first. I should probably do what he said. I don’t even know how to program that well yet. Basically, take a step back and go back on those meds or try a new doctor, get a second opinion, or redo the whole med regamine again. It took me 10 years to find the perfect med combo. I’m no longer going to the hospital 10-20 times a year. I might go 0-1 times a year now. Maybe 2 max."

176102067,"I guess I would take it as a compliment, even though it is quite backhanded and not truly a nice thing to say. What I think they really mean is that they associate schizophrenics as people who can’t take care of themselves and have lots of social issues. Where as you don’t appear to be someone like that. But yeah I hate comments like that in general. Just seems really judgemental. If someone says “I have X” you don’t have to try and argue or question that statement."

Naturally, I have PTSD as well as schizophrenia, and I would note anger. Angry people frighten me, that is.

Let him draw murals."

The male ones try to act all perverted to me too, and then say something gross afterward. I believe the auditory hallucinations want to annoy me. So they talk about topics that don’t interest me. Like if I was into said topic, they would not talk about, but would talk about something else. They also talk about other stuff that i’m not into, like incest and homosexuality. For some reason, they like to praise african american people. Do your voices have similar stuff they say? If so, can you please post it in the comments below.

174367985,"Hey. Currently I’m on 20mg oral haloperidol (Haldol) but I’m getting pretty bad side effects from it. Gonna see my doc this week (hopefully) and probably transition onto a different antipsychotic, and I’m tempted to ask my doctor if he would consider stabilizing me on an oral med and then switching me to a once or twice monthly injection. I’m on medicaid, and I checked with my insurance in my state and they cover all of the atypical LAI’s (risperdal, zyprexa, abilify, invega) fully so money shouldn’t be an issue. In the past I’ve had problems with adherence, either because I just forget to take the med or because I get very very paranoid and start to think the medication is some sort of poison that is killing me. This has been a major reason behind several of my relapses. So this is why I think an injection would be a good idea, also I just hate taking pills every day lol. So, do you think this would be a good idea? Also, please share your own stories about being on an LAI if you don

174367986,I am now 40…and realize over the years that sometimes I care too deeply and want to save people from their problems. This has led to problems and way too much stress for me…is this possibly a characteristic for people who have mental health issues??..sometimes its like I don’t have sense and realize when I just need to watch out for myself because others don’t really care when you fall apart.

176102089,Mate. I had a mate who was a psychiatric nurse. Violence on the wards is way too common and even if your psychotic you know what is right most times. Alls I’m saying.

176102100,"I get weighed again either Monday or next Thursday. I want to be down at least 5 lbs by then. Initial weight loss is always faster, so I’m expecting more because of that. I have to start more steroids whenever I pick up my meds, though, so we’ll see. Hopefully the weight gain from them isn’t too bad since I’m already on steroids. I came upstairs to bed too avoid the kitchen. My stomach is growling, though. I’m hungry, but I already went over my calorie goal for the day by eating a small dinner trying to avoid this. When my stomach starts growling I almost always end up with realty bad acid reflux that causes vomiting. Super fun. Hopefully my meds are enough to stop it."

176102119,Before aps killed my libido I did it a lot. I felt it was a good outlet for my needs instead of sleeping with many different partners or settling for any partner I could find. I always thought of masturbation as healthy and normal.
176102120,"Tbh my guess is that in my illness, i was always a bit way ‘‘dead’’… I was a very inactive and calm kid, i have this illness since kid too and even the docs wonder what i have… I always lacked energy, so my guess is that i feel nothing on zyprexa, cause i was always ‘‘low’’… But it doesnt even put me to sleep lol… Yeah, but even for me its strange to feel nothing…"
174367990,I didn’t like getting pricked so I stuck to pills. But in terms of effectiveness very similar. I was on 300 mg injection. I would also take a pill Started off at 5 mg pill then 10 then 15 then 20 then back to 15. So 25 mg (~10 mg injection 15 mg pill) was ideal for me. Until I took other meds now I’m down on it altogether. But that wasn’t till after I stopped the injection. Well the end of the month I might take extra pills in combo with the injection. My mom said I’d get psychotic the end of the month. So I’d take an extra 5 mg pill. Because not sure if it truly lasts 30 days for everybody. It was helpful though it kept me out of the hospital my whole time on it but it was still rough times in my life.

There are “inner” voices such as when you are thinking to yourself in terms of language, or when you’re imagining you’re hearing something/someone, but the difference is that they do not “sound” like voices coming from outside. If you are hearing voices and having difficulty determining if they come from the outside, you may try covering your ears or putting in earplugs. You can also try a sound recorder device and see if what you think you’re hearing gets recorded (on “tape”, so to speak). -_NAME_."

You can measure the ketosis in your urine telling you when you are burning fat rather than carbs. Have you actually asked your doc about a keto diet? I haven’t had bacon in 15 years before keto.

174368004,my impression is meds help more people than they dont help. i can see that third world countries are less stressful as far as routines and such.
176102149,Yes you can. Before I was diagnosed I had psychotic symptoms but they fluctuated with time appearing for a year or two then disappearing. Drs said its stress and nothing to worry about until I tried to kill myself for the 2nd time to stop the command voices. Then they said I have psychosis nos which later changed to sz as I relapsed after stopping meds.

176102158,"I’ve been through two scenarios. One time they sent me a letter saying they had over-payed me by $12,000. They said I could come in person and discuss it with them. So I made an appointment and brought my step-dad in for support. (Yes, they let you do that.) Anyways, we met with an SSA worker and talked to them for about 40 minutes. Our argument was that I had no idea I was over-payed so it wasn’t my fault and SSDI was my only income and it would take me many years to pay back. I should say here that I found the worker a little creepy. I just had a bad feeling about him like he had a little power over me and he wanted me to beg or something. I’m glad I had my step-dad there for moral support… Anyways, the worker shuffled through huge stacks of papers and forms and he was just beginning to wind it up by saying I had to pay back the $12,000.Like I said I had no job at the time, my only income was SSDI. But as he went through the last stack of papers and we were litterally getting ready to lea
ve right then, he told us to wait a minute. He pulled out a single page form. _PERSON_ what the form was called but it had no writing, it wasn’t filled out. He told this that this was a crucial form that some worker should have given me, but no one gave it to me. The worker said, that since that one form had not been filled out, it meant I was not obligated to pay anything back! Oh man, I don’t think I had ever been happier in my life. So we finished up the meeting with a couple formalities and we left. Oh yeah, twice, years later I logged into my online bank account and saw deposits that I had no clue what they were for. The first one was for $11,000 from the SSA and the second one a year later was for $12,000. They didn’t give me a warning and I called up SS and they said they were back payments that I could do whatever I wanted with them."

In conclusion drugs and genetics.

I am less ill too I find… But my friends see me still as numb and slow, while they get men in their lives, they get jobs while me I have nothing still… One friend today praised to me her fluanxol… But my ex pdoc said, that I should stop switching aps and that in her opinion, zyprexa is the best for me… but this was years ago when my doc stated this and everyone now seems to hate the zyprexa… my ill friends hate the lows from it… but in the same time, they were never scared of everything like I was it… my feeling now is that I need the calming of this zyprexa… plus my illness is chr
onical, not by episodes… I should switch my zyprexa to something else or what? This fluanxol didnt calm me in the past though… I will also post a thread about this deadness in the illness these days… but it’s another story… Tbh, my current pdocs see some small improvement now compared to the severe case that I was… its partly because of my treatment, but my efforts too. No matter what, I am still sick in my mind and I dont know if it’s a good idea to switch to fluanxol now… Am I wrong to wait to erase my symptoms in years here for me? To stop doing these efforts and to believe some fluanxol now, which works in months only for another girl, who never saw the sh** that I saw in my life?? Well, idk if it was a choice to rely on my efforts now… but it’s what makes me a bit happier now…but it’s also hard to see other people ultra happy in their lives, praising their meds for it, while me, I fight the sh** alone now, only with some maintain of zyprexa, not really a “full” help…"

174368024,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ thanks for your reply. I am schizophrenic. I feel the same way about having an “handicap”. I dropped out university, I was studying in the 1st year of engineering a long time ago. I would like to learn more even if I can not be exactly a good engineer but it happens that I do not fit in superior education any more because I fail a lot in exams and now I am much older too. But I am curious and still want to learn. I spend hours reading, but even to choose a path reading, this simple approach would be better with guidance and support. Education is important. I think it is possible for you to be a special education teacher if you acquired the skills to be one, if you know the foundations that lead to be a good teacher. You can be competent I think, specially if you symptoms under control. I believe schizophrenics acquire skills and learn. But certain things could be different for you, you could work less hours, develop various different startegies at work, so you could accomplish e
verything. Schizophrenia onset in men and women vary, so the educational needs are quite different, and also people chose different journeys, some would like to work, some would prefer more intellectual activities, some prefer arts some do not, some people might want life long learning, it depends a lot. We are different for being schizophrenics and diverse as people too, so many educational scenarios could apply for the situation. If we learn, but differently, I think we should not be excluded. If you are qualified you have the possibility to work in your area, here where I live there are initiatives like “supported employment” for example. And you have the right for some adaptations at work if you have any disability, this in ideal, sometimes things are not so linear. I hope this helps in some way. Never underestimate yourself too much, maybe your work would be valuable to many people."

176102238,"I think Geodon and/or Seroquel has increased my breast size. I look like a ninety year old woman with my shirt off. I don’t want to change med’s, because Geodon and Seroquel are the only two antipsychotics that control my symptoms without deadening my mind. In my case, a sedentary lifestyle contributes to the decline of my physique."

176102245,"Well the way you describe it, it sounds like they didn’t diagnose you according to the criteria in the DSM (I’m assuming you’re from the US), which would make misdiagnosis very possible.

176102248,"My parents were happily married until they weren’t. Now they’re happily married to other people. ¨ They decided to get the divorce while they still liked each other enough to remain friends, because they didn’t feel it would be fair on us kids if they let things go further, in case it would get toxic. My dad is a psychologist and has worked with a lot of kids, so he knows what impact an unstable home can have on a kid. I guess he saw a divorce as the lesser of two evils, and I agree with him. Aftar a few years they both found their new partners, and I’ve never seen them happier. My dad actually cried at his wedding because he was so happy. And she’s been good for him, she got him in shape and encouraged him to try new things, and she’s not afraid to challenge him when he gets stubborn. My mother’s husband and I didn’t see eye to eye for the first many years. But he stopped being an arsehole and I stopepd being a brat, and our mutual love for my mother made us work together to try a

My sister and brother think I’m not performing at my potential and that I could eventually work someday. I think they still remember the old me. My sister told me out of the whole family, that she always thought I’d be the one that would make it in the family. Well, I didn’t…thanks to schizophrenia. I use schizophrenia as an excuse but it’s a real piece of ???? disease that holds me back. I keep telling myself it’s like a top 10 disability and that I have a broken brain or brain damage. I’m not the same person anymore. If I didn’t have schizophrenia, I’d like to think I’d be working on wall street making millions, but that too even cracks me up lol. I’d imagine if I worked out every day even if it’s just on the treadmill that I would cut the smoking in half or something. My dad gives me ???? constantly. I seriously think he
s holding me back. Maybe he’s jealous of me or something. He hates giving me money and he also told me a few times a gym membership is a bad idea because I smoke so much and that it’s a waste of money because I’d probably never go. But it’s only 10 dollars a month! Thank You!"
176102251,Thank you all for your feedback so quickly. It helps to put things in perspective. I don’t think that they are technically doing anything against the law as we are somewhat independent and cook our own meals but it is very dysfunctional right now given some of the residents’ lack of understanding of the situation and level of functioning. I have reached out to some very smart and capable people who are looking into things and making phone calls. I hope something good comes out of this. Just not sure what to do in the meantime. We have enough food for the next week so it gives me some time to strategize. Thanks for the support. I haven’t been able to sleep tonight. I am glad I had somewhere to put my thoughts.
176102252,"Funny, I would have guessed you sza."
176102253,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes cognitive symptoms are a part of sz. But there are some medication that I notice handle this effect from sz better. Like invega is doing much better for me in cognitive symptoms. While other meds don’t touch the symptoms. Another thing is cognitive remediation. Look into it. It’s like reading books engaging in something. But this comes after, meds, you might not be able to do that right off the bat. Good luck. Know exactly how you feel."

176102266,"Alright, I’ll take your word for it. And based on that, I’ll offer a different perspective: you can’t do anything because you’re emotionally wounded. I know I was, and before it started to get better I didn’t have anything in me to draw upon to do any of the things that my psychiatrist and case manager were saying I should do it get better. All I wanted to do was analyze myself and my life. The more I delved, the more my mentality changed, and eventually I found some motivation to change my circumstances. Maybe what you need right now is more time to heal your wounded psyche."

It also gave an account of a family plagued by schizophrenia. My only criticism is that the author didn’t really mention negative symptoms, and sometimes it was almost too depressing, but I forgive him for that, as he really couldn’t control it. I highly recommend this book to individuals that are stable enough to read it. It was even sometimes hard to read for me when the author talked about some of the child abuse that happened, or the murder-suicide that took place. But regardless, this still is a very good, researched book that I recommend to anyone interested in schizophrenia. I’m just so grateful for being born in this era of medicine."

174368069,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Cochrane database of systematic reviewsReferences, May 2020 08 Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve satisfactory improvements in their mental state, particularly the symptom of hearing voices (hallucinations), with medical treatment.To examine the effects of Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.In December 2016, November 2018 and April 2019, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) was searched, review authors checked references of all identified relevant reports to identify more studies and contacted authors of trials for additional information.All randomised clinical trials focusing on Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), on an i
ntention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and 95% CIs. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in; mental state, insight, global state, quality of life and functioning as well as adverse effects and leaving the study early.We found 14 potentially relevant references for three studies (participants = 195) comparing Avatar Therapy with two other interventions; treatment as usual or supportive counselling. Both Avatar Therapy and supportive counselling were given in addition (add-on) to the participants' normal care. All of the studies had high risk of bias across one or more domains for methodology and, for other risks of bias, authors from one of the studies were involved in the development of the avatar systems on trial and in another trial, authors had patents on the avatar system pend
ing. 1. Avatar Therapy compared with treatment as usual When Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual average endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Positive (PANSS-P) scores were not different between treatment groups (MD -1.93, 95% CI -5.10 to 1.24; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). A measure of insight (Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire; BAVQ-R) showed an effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -5.97, 95% CI -10.98 to -0.96; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No one was rehospitalised in either group in the short term (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.20; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). Numbers leaving the study early from each group were not clearly different - although more did leave from the Avatar Therapy group (6/14 versus 0/12; RR 11.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 181.41; studies = 1, participants = 26; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in anxiety between treatment groups (
RR 5.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 89.80; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). For quality of life, average Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLESQ-SF) scores favoured Avatar Therapy (MD 9.99, 95% CI 3.89 to 16.09; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported data for functioning. 2. Avatar Therapy compared with supportive counselling When Avatar Therapy was compared with supportive counselling (all short-term), general mental state (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)) scores favoured the Avatar Therapy group (MD -4.74, 95% CI -8.01 to -1.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). For insight (BAVQ-R), there was a small effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -8.39, 95% CI -14.31 to -2.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). Around 20% of each group left the study early (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89; studies = 1, participants = 150; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of 
quality of life scores (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA)) showed no clear difference between groups (MD 2.69, 95% CI -1.48 to 6.86; studies = 1, participants = 120; low-certainty evidence). No data were available for rehospitalisation rates, adverse events or functioning.Our analyses of available data shows few, if any, consistent effects of Avatar Therapy for people living with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations. Where there are effects, or suggestions of effects, we are uncertain because of their risk of bias and their unclear clinical meaning. The theory behind Avatar Therapy is compelling but the practice needs testing in large, long, well-designed, well-reported randomised trials undertaken with help from - but not under the direction of - Avatar Therapy pioneers."

Chakras do strike me as interesting up to a point, but again, it is my algebra (or disorganised thinking) that is the problem, and I don’t think the colours my teacher chose are really the best for me.

If you make a mistake, own your responsibility for your mistake and apologize correctly. A correct apology looks like “I am sorry that i did X and it hurt you.

174368072,"I am fortunate that I’ve made it as far as I have–I’m in my mid-fifties. Many people with similar psychiatric illnesses don’t live this long. This is despite the commonly held expectation among non-afflicted that most people should live into their eighties or nineties. The average life expectancy for people with schizophrenia is about sixty years. I hope to live longer than that, but no one can predict the future. Meanwhile, I am experiencing the numerous ramifications of being older and having schizophrenia. In the past, I’ve done essays about people with mental illness having short and tragic lives, and how healthy living habits aren’t promoted by treatment practitioners. Institutionalized mentally ill people are often provided with a poor diet, high in fatty and sugary foods. The medications we are mandated to take often block the ability to exercise the body. These medications are often harmful to the organs. Additionally, physicians don’t try as hard to help mentally ill people h
ave a long, healthy lifespan; this could be due to the presumption that our lives are not valuable. However, the focus on this week’s column is that of living as a somewhat older person with this disease. And there are many aspects to that.

176102467,"I have found best way to deal with it is an hour or two naps thru day time, and full night sleep. and sadly very little activity to increase heart rate / blood pressure, also less caffeine , more vegetables… I however am a meat eater so I only eat meats."
176102468,Blindness is worse than sz for me. Imagine seeing all black for the rest of your life. Its sad and depressing. I will get suicidal.
176102469,"That’s not true for a lot of us. I’m on meds and work a part time job, am married, and raising kids. Your life is what you make of it. Medication and therapy and psychiatric medicine helps me reach a higher function level."
176102470,"First of all I am really sorry for keeping on talking about it. When my psychologist looked up what _NAME_ syndrome was she went “yuck”… well I don’t have it so bad, yet. Now all of a sudden I feel like I am in pain since I have been told its a possibility and I keep looking for when the next blister is."
176102471,I’m 97.5 kg I’m down
176102472,I think it should be mandatory.
176102473,I am on Risperdal 6 mg and find it very difficult to wake up in the morning…Once I am up I drink 2 cups of tea and the drowsiness reduces. I was on modafinil 2 years ago but it was causing an increased heart rate so my doctor had to stop it. I have tried Invega which is very much similar in effectiveness to Risperdal and it is less sedative but again it causes tachycardia(high heart rate) and headache so I am sticking to Risperdal which is safe.
174368079,I also think so.
176102474,Sounds Terrible “brah”… . …
176102475,"She has been in psychosis for 7 years… late onset seems to be pretty extreme in her case Other drugs will have massively contributed found old heroin paraphernalia in an art book recently from a few years ago, but that is not her whole problem, it seems to be something she has mostly kept from me"
176102476,I try to tell him most of everything that’s not embarrassing like when the voices push bad things
176102477,How do they effect you Do they return to normal after stopping the medication?
176102478,_AT_MENTION_ is right. You need an advocate to go with you and not let them mistreat you or blow you off. They need to at least run some tests to make sure you’re ok.
176102479,I did WW about ten years ago and was successful with it. Its an easy program to follow and I heard its even more flexible now. Good luck!
176102480,"I sleep at least 12 hours a night, sometimes up to 13 or 14. 9 or 10 sounds legit."
176102481,"I have been prescribed gabapentin 100 mg 3x daily for anxiety. Has anyone here tried this med, and how did it work for you? I have severe social anxiety"
176102482,"Wake up and take a shower, dress and maybe go out for some coffee."
176102483,Yes no one wants to hear my mental illness complaints and I don’t dare bring it up!
176102484,That’s funny double trouble
176102485,Good luck! What will you say is your reason for not working all that time?
174368077,"Like said. I never stick to something. And I know I can’t. Is there more for a schizophrenic than zoning out ? For me the answer is no. Being pretty negative about it. But I’m not willing strong enough to change. Everyday there comes a time when I’m happy that I don’t have more responsibilities. Am I really waiting for my last day on this planet ? I think so. My doctor knows that I’m unable to do certain things. And my disability pension is not granted yet. They still need to work through the papers. At least, I bought, when the internet is gone, bc my father forgot to pay the bill, DvDs and a DvD player here. Maybe next time go for blu ray ? But I just like 80s and 90s movies. New stuff looks to complicated."
176102486,I hear music outside my head all the time. It’s not real and I know it’s not real. I don’t mind it. Especially when it’s beautiful symphonic music.
176102487,"_PERSON_… Is this smart to be drinking, it made me so out of it today? I had it this morning. Anyone know what these supplements are. People in my house are annoyed by all the tea I’ve been buying haha. I go grocery shopping, and I get tea every time…"
176102488,Weight Watchers. Zyprexa made my stomach stick out more. Now it’s really embarrassing and I have to wear only certain shirts I have so it’s not so obvious. I think I’ll start it Monday
176102489,"I can tell you I’ve been turned 180 degrees around after a shot of Haldol. I don’t like it long-term, but it’s the best rescue med to get me out of psychosis."
176102490,thanks _AT_MENTION_ …
176102491,Ask them? I am not a priest.
176102492,They’re not irrational either I used to have sex with men and I’m not even gay I was basically a prostitute sleeping in hotels with guys
176102493,Yeah I don’t like the loud booms. Makes me uneasy!
176102494,"Well, in the U. S. 95% of the wealth is held by 3% of the poulation. Under my plan we would give the rest of the money to the rich so they have 100% of the wealth. The beauty of my plan is that a 100% is a nice even number and easy to remember and would eliminate odd awkward numbers like 3% or 5%. The rest of us can eat off the land with berries and the occasiional wild turkey and leave the rich alone so they can finally live in peace, miles from poor people and finally be able to relax and put in another swimming pool. They deserve a break."
176102495,I write things down all the time and take with me. I want to make sure I remember everything and she never has a problem with it.
176102496,"Video games. Working out , eating healthy fruits, anime that’s a big one."
176102497,"I was told by my psychiatrist that I could take it all at night. I really wish I hadn’t split the dose because 3 years later I still get sleepy 6 hours after I take am meds. But I take 2.25mg in the am. Ask if you can take it all at night! Also, I would definitely try to stay at a lowest effective dose. Risperdal causes anhedonia and motivation problems for me. Never had these problems in 20 years since being diagnosed, then they were instant. I wish like **** I was only on 2 mg."
176102498,"I didn’t intend to condemn you, I just wanted to show you the way, not knowing you have already know it and walked along it, Forgive me, Other than what I said, what can I do except prayers, Can’t you see a judge to put an order on her? To administer her injections forcefully, I know what a mess this can be, I which show myself as an logical and sober man have had 4 times of suicide, its because of god that I’m alive yet,"
176102499,I had a crush on my last psychiatrist. She was very pretty but I did not make any kind of move as I knew this would be very awkward to say the least. It’s not a good idea _AT_MENTION_ . It could lead to trouble.
176102500,Being on your own home alone gets easier as you get older. Still miss my mums roast dinners tho on a sunday. But im 44 now - and fiercely protective of my man cave/flat now - and dont like visitors.
176102501,I have many goals. Not able to choose between them. _PERSON_…
174368088,"No not really. For the first few days after I increased the dose, I was a bit anxious."
176102502,"_AT_MENTION_ I highly doubt that… Im friendly and always wave to people i ride by when i travel to town on my push bike… I get the symptoms even when I am at home… I can even hear the triggered b.s with my own blood saying something before I say it, it is not so… comfy."
176102503,"idk 3 seems like a good number for now, it makes it more inclusive for others to join in also you got to use your turns wisely,"
174368080,"Iv been going to some of the same things including that the voices say that iam going to get tortured forever but I dont belive it I know that some day they will stop they also say that nothing is me and it’s all them doing stuff for me me but I still feel like I still sort of have free will but alot of my thoughts are gone and the voice in my head head is gone that used to be me but I still have enjoyment the voices even help with that and say it’s not for me but for them cuz they are experiencing though my body. It’s bad for me they give me visions and feelings of hell and my family getting tortured. It’s really bad they say that iam gonna die when when iam old or they can kill me to be a god but they say I failed cuz I smoke cigs but I dont belive that they say iam the weakest being and I think there are worst out there that smoke meth and stuff. They do some thing so I dont feel nicotine or drugs any more and say that they disconnected brain tissue and I dont belive that. They also say 
that they are testing me and give good thoughts as well as bad ones to see whether I accept the bad ones or negative ones they say are true but I know them not to be true. They tell the future and say they are real people not demons but I know this to be a lie to they scare the crap out of me and threaten me with pain beyond what I can understand. They seem to tell the future by making me thing or say some thing then some one else is saying or on tv. They say that all I do is them and not me any more and get really mad at me for enjoying stuff like food sex and most of all ciggorets which i am quitting tonight becouse iam tired of hearing it from them about how they are gonna torture me for smoking they also say that a trillion people are watching me becouse iam so week and cry and they give me fealings to smoke to see if I do and make a huge deal out of it. They say that there was a death game that played with every body they pasted and left me behind to be gods and iam the only one left and no one is real o
r them they always threaten my mom with hell or it’s not her or that she is in hell and they tell me to do stuff to save her and they say iam am the only one that is going to hell forever cuz I smoke but the fealings i get to smoke are strong and i like to smoke but the voices even said they would leave me if i quit but now they say it to late cuz i smoked. They control my body by making me do hand gestures I certain ways at times to make it seem like its them or to send me a message they also say that they will eat me or take my body out of its reality to torture and they say that it’s all in my memory that I am going to expernce it when I die and it alot or torture that they say that they do. This all started when they said that they where god, jesus, the red dragon, the virgin _NAME_. I even had a time where it was fun and spoke in different voices and attacked my mom which I know want me cuz I love my mom more than any thing. This has been going on for three years now and the meds haven’t been worki
ng I know it’s a sprirt cuz I saw shadow people and a flouting roting head with fire. These voices are smart as hell and are good at calculating things like what happens in video games to send a message the street names around where I live reflect my delusions which is weird or things on tv will reflect my life and tell me that I was planned as a joke to be the weakest. I know this to be a lie and god is with me but they say that they are god and he made me as a joke like I have previously stated. They set up coincidences all day long to freak me out. They also love to give me feelings In my body to boost what they have to say. I feel as though I opened my self to some demon that has been with me since I’ve been little and they talk in cartoons and show me such and say they are making a moving I hope that one day we both find a cure as iv been to many shawmans that couldn’t take them away. God bless"

176102508,Just came out of my session. Quite a lot to take in… He says I don’t only have sza but I also have borderline personality disorder. That i have complex mental health problems. That he can’t help me much but he said I must get into state sector and under a whole mental health team. It’s a lifelong condition that won’t go away. And he said I have self sabotage because I keep on denying my condition when I know I have it. Sounds a bit like he’s upset but anyway - maybe the state team will help better. Maybe my sza and bpd is too severe for private Dr’s… actually when I was under state pdoc’s they also picked up the borderline… Does make sense that I have bpd as well bcuz my moods too quick and I get rages. He said my short hypomanic episodes not really hypomania but can be from borderline. Also explains my cutting urges. So there you have it - I’m a basket case lol!
176102509,"Man, not me yet. Imma roll _AT_MENTION_ and steal his second dose if he isn’t careful."
176102510,"haha, is that to me or to her? I think she said she has pneumonia. I’m always well, I’m high functioning, stable on meds, just a topic I can’t talk about and it would mean the world to me if we could."

Coming off seroquel cold turkey was awful I had severe insomnia like could not sleep at all for 2 weeks. I learned my lesson after that and tapered the next time I came off. I actually wanted to start up seroquel again lately bc my sleep has been so messed up from fasting…but it is actually somewhat normalizing now. So I ended up not needing it. I hope coming off it isn’t so bad for you."

174368087,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I believe I read somewhere that they’re trying to get rid of the schizoaffective diagnosis because there really is no reason to have a specific disorder for something that’s really just the same thing as having comorbid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder/depression. Plus, sza is very poorly defined. I’ve personally observed a sort of divide between sza’s. There are those of us who have severe mood disorder with mild psychosis, there are those of us who have severe psychosis and mild mood symptoms, and there are those of us who have equally severe mood and psychotic symptoms."

176102536,How so? No med worked for you? How did you treat your sz without meds??
176102537,If you are predisposed to sz weed can cause it to start. Not cause it per say. Many diseases can’t be cured. We can hope that they find better treatments but I doubt there is a cure in the future.
176102538,My paranoia can increase with sounds(not hallucinations) . I was in bed getting into sleep mode when there was a sound like someone was at my bedroom window. As I live on the 1st floor that’s extremely unlikely . Nonetheless my paranoia ramped up and now I’m wide awake. Sounds can and do increase my paranoia. Part of it is due to a degree of difficulty pinpointing where random noises are coming from .
176102539,This isnt a forum for PTSD it takes more to “trigger” psychosis than a few posts stress can trigger psychosis but not talking about delusions or wine drinkers. BTW wine and drugs can trigger psychosis .

176102542,I was going to say that but that’s extremely rare and that’s bcz the parents have a severe mental illness or mental disability.

176102573,"You should definitely give them a try. There’s no 100% chance that the first prescribed SSRI will work for you, but they surely have potential to treat anxiety. If we’re talking about anxiety, the drugs that made me most confident were paroxetine and escitalopram. Others just didn’t really work for me or even have made my condition worse. But it depends on a person if the drug will work or not. You should not be afraid of them. Remember, the first two weeks may worsen your condition, but after that you should be better. If it doesn’t work, you can discontinue them, with a help of your psychiatrist of course."

176102580,I get my second shot in a couple of days. I’m kind of nervous about it.
176102581,I’d argue and quite rightly if your recover from 1st episode psychosis and you don’t need meds then your not sz. Don’t get me wrong a lot of people do but for most of us around here it’s meds for life on our current technology. People don’t take antipsychotics if they don’t need them. You have to remember this is a pro medication website and if you hang around long enough you’ll see the wisdom in that approach.

The feeling was so strong, and I had what some people call an “anticipatory high” from just knowing I would have crack the next day. I woke up the next morning and the first thing I thought was, “That was crazy”. And I didn’t smoke or drink that day or any day since. That was about in January of 1990. And the craving and obsession to use was lifted from me and has never come back. I never feel tempted to drink or do drugs. This is what AA did for me. Yeah, the mountain biking or playing guitar is a good idea. Just doing something to distract you until the feeling to use passes."

174368119,So I had a doctor’s appointment on Thursday and when my psych looked at my records she seen that I have tried all of the atypical antipsychotics with no relief. So she immediately was down for Clozapine. I’m super excited yet super nervous. But I will never know unless I try. I was curious to others that are on Clozapine when they saw symptoms relief. I know that I can take up to six weeks to see full benefit but I was curious if anyone saw any benefits in the first few weeks.
176102602,"I was way down to 157.2 lbs. again this morning. I am so happy. Now, I got to keep this off and take off some more. I noticed I had over 300 calories left over to eat yesterday that I didn’t eat. That’s why I’m down weight today. I got to do that more often to take more of this weight off.

Does anyone know if Medicare or Medicaid pays for preventive classes or steps on how to try to avoid spontaneously combusting? I mean, _PERSON_ hospitals offer acupuncture by a professional so maybe an expert with Medicare could come to my house for a consultation. I don’t want to fry, it’s such an inglorious ending. I worry about this even more than I worry about catching leprosy or elephantitus."
174368120,My sz started when the _NAME_ were looking to punish me for something I said to a local commander. I had cars and people follow me everywhere.

I don’t want to wear those clothes again, but someone will jump on nice office wear. I have the new stuff I bought for work, that will do just fine. Goodwill is going to love me. I have a big underbed box of knitting supplies, three boxes of really nice clothes, and another box coming with books and misc stuff. Plus the box that has been under my kitchen table for 2 years with various things in it. I am going to feel really good once I get all that stuff out of my house!"
176102614,"The main voice as well as the group of voices have told me, “You will suffocate.” Also, they have given me dreams in regards to suffocating also (though I believe this is a metaphorical term to something that is not physical that can suffocate me, but mental/spiritual).

176102616,"But doesn’t it seem that way at the moment? I strongly think that as the public learns more about psychotic conditions (like, the real stuff-- not the _PERSON_-type theatrics), then perhaps there might be some understanding and mutual “okayness” about psychotic conditions.

176102623,"_AT_MENTION_ You might be able to get away with eating more calories in a day if you’re going hungry, depending on what your goals are. I recommend you join a weight loss website like Sparkpeople or MyFitnessPal and enter your goals into their start screen. I don’t have experience with MyFitnessPal, but Sparkpeople will ask your starting and goal weights, and when you want to lose by, and it will assign you calories, carbs, protein, and fats. I also track fiber and sugar. I wouldn’t know how much to eat on my own, I would just be experimenting along the way. I stick to 1400 as my max, but that doesn’t mean it’s right for everyone. That’s why I let _PERSON_ tell me what’s best. I have it set to get to 175 by June 30, 2020 (I’m 234 now) and it says I can have 1290-1640 calories a day. I just choose to limit to 1400 max because I’m on Zyprexa. _AT_MENTION_ I have never heard of XLS fat binder. I agree with you though that you should be losing faster considering your efforts! Like I s
aid to _AT_MENTION_ , maybe you can get away with more calories since you’re burning so much. My 1290-1640 assigned by Sparkpeople is considering zero exercise. Surely you can eat more than 1500 calories being that active. Maybe your body just wants to hold on to what you give it because you’re burning so many calories. We need to figure out how to trick your body again! Don’t do an extreme diet, even with doctor supervision. I did MediFast many years ago back when phen/fen was still being prescribed. I gained all that weight back FAST. As with any program, you have to make real lifestyle changes, or else you’ll just go right back to old habits and regain the weight. You have to make new habits in order to maintain the loss. _AT_MENTION_ Good for you! I can’t wait until I can say I’m out of the 200s! You must be really antsy to have to scale give you a reading in one-derland!"

I haven’t changed meds yet, but when I tried a taper recently my mood got very erratic. I wasn’t a risk to myself but I was worried things might reach that point before I went back to the original dose and my mood leveled out resultantly. When I brought up to her the topic of what I might have to go to the hospital for in the future, my old therapist said a med change can be a valid reason to go (so I guess, in that sense, I already have my answer). I don’t like the hospital (though that begs the question of who does?) but I will go if I have to, of course. She said a stay for this reason would probably only last a few days anyway. Any of you ever gone to the hospital for this reason?"
176102627,thanks for the advice. I usually watch a tv show or play a video game. Or just sleep.

176102658,"? Magnesium oxide contains the most elemental magnesium compared to other magnesium compounds (about 60%), which makes it quite popular among the manufacturers of supplements. However, this factor is of minimal importance when considering bioavailability. Our body very poorly absorbs magnesium from this compound (approximately three times less than magnesium citrate). Only about 4% of its elemental magnesium is absorbed, which means that your body will absorb only 7.2 mg of magnesium when taking a tablet containing 300 mg of magnesium oxide. ? On the other hand, magnesium citrate contains only about 16% magnesium, but is quite well absorbed by our body. About 25 to 30% of elemental magnesium is absorbed from this compound. If we look through the prism of milligram, this would mean that from 48 mg of magnesium as much as 300 mg of magnesium citrate, our body absorbs 14.4 mg of magnesium. I would add that one of the advantages of magnesium citrate is that it can be used in the prevention and treatmen

174368144,I still feel I have more common sense than a lot of people though. That is something that is learned lol.
176102743,I take my meds like clockwork at 08:00 and 20:00. Some are prescribed for mornings and some to take at night.
176102744,"We all fall victim to the lure of no meds from time to time. My last try was two years ago. It was a horrible mistake. My way of coping is coming on here and saying something, then getting flooded with people telling me how bad it went for them when they went off their meds. For me, I ended up calling the crisis line three times in a week for suicidal thoughts. That was when I committed to staying on meds for life. The temptation is still there, but I try to ignore it"
176102745,They also caused anhedonia and avolition. Never had that before either and 100% sure it’s not mental illness.

176102753,"No psychiatrist will ever suddenly stop your meds without reducing the dose. If you get psychosis after lowering dosage this means you have genetic psychosis assuming you’re not taking drugs that cause psychosis like weed, cocaine, etc Lowering meds dosage doesn’t cause psychosis, otherwise 100% of ppl with 1 psychosis will have lifetime sz which is not true, many ppl with 1 psychosis recover and don’t need meds."
176102754,"Noise, I have been reading some of your past posts from 2017. I know you can’t take med. It has been two years now. Are you still not taking any med. How did you cope with your symptoms? Hope you feel better soon."
176102755,"The med’s can affect people differently. I knew this one guy who could take any amount of Stellazine, and it did nothing to him. Just a little bit of that stuff puts me flat on my back. I can take any amount of Trazodone and it has no effect on me. Just 50 mg of that stuff puts some people into a deep sleep for twenty hours. Antipsychotics generally weaken people quite a bit when they take them. This is a big issue for the guys in prison who are forced to take antipsychotics. This guy in prison said on tv one time, “I can’t take these. I have to be able to defend myself.” Antipsychotics also disrupt your body’s temperature regulation mechanisms. They make you more susceptible to hyperthermia in summer, and hypothermia in winter. If it wasn’t for that I could get a job digging ditches. I used to love to go backpacking, but I don’t think I should try it while I’m on antipsychotic medications."
176102756,I hope your situation gets settled and you find some peace _AT_MENTION_
176102757,"When I’ve had similar thoughts about these things, my boyfriend tries to tell me its because of a collective unconscious. Like using the same themes over and over again. I think it also has to do with the mind focusing on a specific subject. ie lets say your thinking about elephants and you think about them all day. Well in the next few days, elephants will begin to appear just because you’ll notice them more. It’s weird how the mind works."
176102758,Understood! The phone is different for each user.

174368164,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Impact of long-term institutionalization on experiential pleasure and motivation in patients with schizophrenia. MY _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PsyCh journal , Jul 22 2019 Anhedonia and amotivation, the hallmarks of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, are believed to be due to ""emotion-behavior decoupling,"" a failure in translating pleasure experience into appropriate goal-directed behavior. A number of studies have reported that long-term institutionalized schizophrenia patients suffer from more severe negative symptoms than community-dwelling patients, but few studies have investigated pleasure experience and motivational behavior in schizophrenia patients who have experienced long-term institutionalization. In this study, we recruited 26 long-term institutionalized schizophrenia patients, 27 community-dwelling schizophrenia patients, and 27 healthy controls. Participants were administered two specific computer-based tasks 
to assess anhedonia and amotivation. The Anticipatory and Consummatory Pleasure (ACP) Task was used to measure emotion-behavior decoupling and the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) was used to measure amotivation related to rewards. Findings from the ACP Task showed that compared with healthy controls, the coupling between emotion experience and motivated behavior was significantly weaker in both clinical groups, suggesting that emotion-behavior decoupling could be a stable trait in schizophrenia patients. In the EEfRT, compared with both community-dwelling patients and healthy controls, institutionalized patients with schizophrenia failed to expend more effort to gain potential rewards even when reward probability increased. These findings further reveal the underlying mechanism of anhedonia and amotivation and their potential relationships with long-term institutionalization in patients with schizophrenia."

176102821,"I didn’t read that one very thoroughly, but it references mostly longitudinal studies, including one by the lead author, that like everhopeful pointed out, do not control sufficiently for factors contributing to use vs. non-use of AP medication. Such studies can only be interpreted adequately by people who have a relevant education and are up-to-date on all the relevant research, making them irrelevant for most people. Also, I tried looking up the dopamine supersensitivity syndrome, and I found a very thorough review that cited among others this authors longitudinal study, but concluded that the evidence for it was largely lacking. Then there’s the fact that the conclusion in this review paper you named is basically a cautious but pessimistic “we need more research”, combined with the fact that most reviews and _NAME_-analyses on this subject are optimistic. All in all, the consensus seems to be that long-term AP use is helpful, but that there are still some objections and things to work ou

I wanted to know my allergies which defeated the point of the test but it was on an October sale and cost me £25. (It is usually £120 when no offer is on!)

176102836,"Geodon has a shorter half life than other medications. Some doctors underestimate the problem this causes, and say once a day is fine. But it is very noticeable for a lot of people. Splitting your dose into morning and evening doses could help a lot. Also, starting on 60 mg is quite a bit, which could account for the intense side effects at first. If you were more stable, I would guess your doctor would have preferred to start you on 20 mg for a week and slowly increase. The side effects should wear off as you gey more used to the med. Another thing to be aware of with geodon is that you need to eat at least 500 calories right before you take it, or else it won’t build up in your system. It will just make you really dizzy for a few hours, then get washed out."

But what I realize is the problem now is the herbal supplement I take called kratom. It doesn’t produce any noticeable high, just a mood boost and is now being studied for it’s novel anti-psychotic properties. It helps with the voices. However I noticed that I am anxious and restless and fatigued if I don’t have it, so I am tapering down from that now. I didn’t realize it could cause a mild withdrawal symptom because my doctor said it was safe to take! But I don’t like being physically dependent on anything other than my antipsychotic medication. My plan is to taper down just in time for when I go to the monastery in December. I’m going to go as slow as possible so I don’t have any trouble. I am going back to San _NAME_ on Friday because I can’t handle my dad’s shifting and unreliable moods (unmedicated bipolar). But the good thing is, he’s in a bett
er mood now, so I will be able to reconcile things with him before I leave. My mom and brother in San _NAME_ are both doing a DBT program 3 hours a week, and I’m very proud of the progress they’ve made. Hopefully things will be less stressful and triggering when I go back. I truly believe I will make it to February 12 without being hospitalized, which will mean it will be my first FULL YEAR out of the hospital since being diagnosed! I am going to go back to the psychosis clinic there, but I have a referral for a clinical psychologist certified as a Jungian Analyst and a referral for a psychiatrist too. I am going to start working towards my goal of becoming a priest. I don’t know if the monastery is right for me, or a more apostolic/active life, so I am going on two retreats over December, 10 days at the monastery, and 1 day at the Augustinian house. If I decided to join the Augustinians or another active order, you know what I would do?? I will become a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner and get certified 
as a Jungian Analyst. That way, I can incorporate that way of serving people with my vocation as a priest, since this order focuses on outreach to impoverished communities in Latin America, and I think a PMHNP would be invaluable for that. I have been encouraged by clinicians in the past to go into the mental health field because of my vast knowledge of psychopharmacology. I don’t know for sure what the future holds but I feel that after these 5 years of being SZ I am finally starting to recover, and I am no longer viewing my life as something that just “happens” to me, I am taking AGENCY to shape my own life. Side question: What do you guys think of Jungian therapy? Have you ever tried it? It’s not usually regarded as the “gold standard” for psychosis (that’s CBT), but there is a lot of evidence for it’s effectiveness, and I personally think it would be a great fit because it’s very spiritual-oriented and I’m a very spiritual person.

176102935,"Oh, I always admired my sister, ya know In fact, she went a bit away from my life and suffering, but she told me once, that its cause she has one life… But its my sista still She teched me many things, who made me a cooler person now lol I wasn’t raised only by my mom, but also by this character of my sista . I wish we had better relationship with her, but I struggle even to talk, so its difficult. But she is still by _NAME_ lol . I am just bad at taking compliments I guess."
176102936,i doubt it cause it prob wasn’t big sum i gues… they have other worries i think. If it was big sum then maybe it would be worth it for them but for small sum they not gonna care about it

176102940,I’m on Topamax and I don’t know if I am dumb or not. That’s for other people to decide. It didn’t help me lose weight but it may be helping me to keep weight off? Who knows? My weight is within normal limits. I take it for migraines. It doesn’t prevent them but it reduces their severity.

176102947,Hey _AT_MENTION_ . That sounds a lot like my paranoia. I wonder why people say what words and totally take things out of context. Meds help for sure but when stressed I do tend to get a little paranoid. It is really subtle sometimes…it’s not always that people are out to get you.

I have 24/7 security cameras up around the entire house, which has helped so much with peace of mind and I haven’t caught anything weird on them either. Plus I was loosing things in the house for days and be stressed someone broke in and stole it only to find out a few days later I just misplaced it. So the cameras help with stress and parinoia when I misplace things also. I also dead blot my door and put a chair under the knob every night I’ve lived here for two years and dowling wood in all windows. So boom… Come for me… #dontactually #nooffence"
176102951,"I certainly hope you were able to apologize to those people. Psychosis can make us act in ways we aren’t proud of. The important thing is committing to doing better in the future. It sounds like you know what you did was wrong, and won’t be repeating your actions, which is good."

176102962,"I have advice. Give yourself a huge amount of credit. OCD is hugely hard to overcome. If you broke away from it this morning that’s amazing. You should celebrate. As far as the anxiety goes and the worry that’s to be expected, you’re out of your comfort zone. I guess you’re going to have to tolerate that for a while as you are going through this change. I know that’s not great. But great job giving up your rituals."

176102971,"Hi! thought broadcasting was the principal motif of one of my psychotic breaks almost a year ago. I usually play music with people. Well in this case everyone else was inherently sadistic and wanted to hurt me. When i played music, I was communicating personal secrets to everybody (for example my e-mail passwords, etc.). And I thought that through music you can communicate absolute everything in a state of special consciousness And there was a conspiracy of psychopats interested in my “inhability” to control my thoughts and shut up, for the sake of their pleasure. The curious thing, when I stopped playing or listening (which I almost couldn´t stop during the break because i was addicted to listening music to hear what they knew about me) to music, then the auditory voices would come and make me miserable in other way."
176102972,Yeah distractions are really helpful but there’s only a certain amount Of time you can distract yourself. I’d try a different med.

176102976,If this is the case then making the most out of this life is a must. Why hypothesize about death unless you really want it? If it is not a choice and immortal life is the way it is then it is better to set about life in a way that is enjoyable to you. Ruminating on death when it is inevitable for all of us is a waste of time. Accept it and enjoy. If it is not then accept and enjoy.

174368215,"I’m diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder (and exploring the possibility of C-PTSD) I’ve noticed that there’s a significant change in my mood and motivations during the Fall season. I’m not sure if this is due to Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas during this season or if it’s the absolutely lovely weather. But I’m usually rather depressed, withdrawn and can’t find any motivation, drive and my brain doesn’t connect two and two together for doing things like chores and stuff. But during the Fall, these seem to get a bit better and I’m more motivated than I’ve been in a while. Like. I feel like my spirit is buzzing with some sort of excitement but I have no way to release this energy. And I don’t know why, but it always seems to happen during the Fall. I don’t have periods of mania or depression, but this kind of feels like it might be mania? It’s difficult to describe. Does anyone else experience something similar?"

176102987,"Sorry for giving unwanted advice, but if I could make a recommendation, I had GREAT success fasting for 16 hours a day and eating within an 8 hour window. Would that be an option? I lost a ton of weight doing the 16 hour fast daily, and it was pretty darn easy too. Personally I’d always fail on a fast that is longer than 16-20 hours, but 16 hours seems super manageable to me. The only reason I stopped is because I had a job that I had to be up super early for, and my schedule got all cruddy. I’m consider trying it again, as I felt pretty good fasting."
176102988,What are both of those? The ‘broke plate’ sounds funny.
176102989,Really? Which meds are that? Seroquel? I just had a cold and drank cough syrup.
176102990,"yes, and i have stopped, many times. lately it’s been no desire to stop. actually the opposite, wanting more medication. feeling terrible."
176102992,It would be nice if anyone gave me a reason to stay on the medication. But locking a thread that merely states the origin of the label by a Eugenicist only further leaves me feeling isolated. So much that I feel like giving in and just rejecting the label completely.
176102993,An easy solution Experiment: If it is in your mind Go to a week long meditation retreat with your mom And learn to empty your mind. A trained lama can easily help you get through it This is the ultimate way to see if it works By the time you finish You can see for yourself If it is in your mind Or if you got any better Then you can stop worrying about whether it is in your mind or not. That’s how I got closure
176102994,Why would she have two black eyes?
176102995,I think I get that. A lot of people are selfish and want to rise on the expense of others. I have met my fair share. It’s too bad you have had a lot of people like that around. Just remember there are good people out there too.
176102996,"I showered two days ago, but I need to again, and I especially need to wash my hair. I think that’s been about four days. I’m seeing demons, though, so I don’t want to be trapped in the bathroom for longer than I have to be. Especially not the shower where I have to close the curtain. And I can’t take a bath because I’m out of scrubbing bubbles to clean the tub. And my tub gets gross- my son is in construction carpentry, so you can imagine! Excuses, excuses, right? I plan to get hubby’s help tonight. He can sit in the bathroom with me."
176102997,They’ll listen to you if you are able to prove you are responsible. Trying to run away and change your meds to pills after trying to go off them before isn’t yet proof. They allowed me to change meds but that was because it took years of listening to them and being complaint.
176102998,"Means to value means, for some of us it means something to attach a worth to things, be it sex or charity or kindness whilst for some it is just an action; it doesn’t hold anything to us beyond being something that simply gets done."

174368206,"Aripiprazole has been the best AP I’ve been on, as far as efficacy and getting no side effects from it. I get it in the form of depot shots. I take Lamotrigine, too, and get no noticeable side effects from that, good mood stabilizer for me. It all varies from person to person, though."

176103006,Yah I thought that. I used to be on it but now I am not. There is a card you can get so you are only charged $25 each month. But that to me is still too expensive. Your doc should know about the card. It’s literally hundreds of dollars a month because you can’t get it generic yet. I can look up this card if you want. You have to call them first to be put in the system but it doesn’t expire.

No need to worry about leaves as it will settle at bottom after a good stir with spoon."
176103010,Yeah it’s hard and most here have the same issue. Sometimes trying other meds helps. It’s hit or miss though so that is a problem. I’ve actually lost weight on zyprexa. I am more motivated and it’s a notorious weight gainer. It improves my mind enough I can get some energy but it’s hard work… Talk to your doctor. It’s not easy but I’ve lost weight on a notorious weight gainer simply because it’s better for me mentally. That is the problem. There’s no easy answers and sometimes you need to try things that might be counter-intuitive.

176103014,"I just feel there is no point to my existence. All my family is indifferent. Apparently I’m just too much hard work to have a relationship with. If I’m not your servant, running around doing favours and errands for you, or giving you unconditional emotional support & validation (which I provide but never get in return which makes me mad) then I don’t exist. My friends are the same. Who wants to be friends with, not only a sz who is disconnected from reality but, a borderline personality disorder who apparently is such a pain in the arse emotionally that you can only dump problems on her but never give any support back? I’m at a loss. I read this article recently by a borderline sufferer, “_PERSON_”, who’s managed to become a qualified psychologist. She’s defend the borderlines’ plight to the rest of the psychologists’ world. She said for us, our expectations are enormous & can never be met by a society that is largely indifferent & if not is hostile. Whoa. Indifferent, hostile? 
WOW. Really? Any more sz borderlines out there that can validate me? With respect to those that have lived thu life-threatening illnesses, she said she’d rather have terminal illness than borderline because at least with a terminal illness your emotions are validated & your emotional needs are met because people believe & value your emotions. Against all odds I have 2 good, casual jobs. I don’t got no shifts for 4 days. I believe my siblings are indifferent to me in current day and to the past abuse (even tho they witnessed it in real time and I spent all my pocket money on lollies trying make them feel ok at the time). So who can I turn to for validation? I’m just a useless basket case taking up space. I look after my cat well but apart from that I serve no purpose."

But I wish you well and I hope you can find peace of mind and not be bothered by these experiences or perceptions. At the subatomic level we are all energy; at the quantum level, we are all just this beautiful electrical-chemical energy and it’s uniform, meaning that when you tap into this place all things are at the basic sense the same source.

176103017,"Truth is, you can’t always know. If you’re with someone you can trust, you can ask if they saw/heard/smelled what you experienced. Sometimes logic works.

You might see places you really like and if there’s a waiting list put your name on it and might open up in a couple months.

176103033,"The answer is it’s more an opioid receptor antagonist Does naltrexone affect dopamine? Naltrexone is not a narcotic, but it does block serotonin and dopamine , the naturally occurring opioid neurotransmitters in the brain from attaching to a cell or nerve receptors in the body. … Naltrexone is also used in treatment for alcohol dependence. So it does limit dopamine in A similar way In a sense our antipsychotics block dopamine excretion Just it says also it blocks pleasure you get from drinking alcohol This drug has really helped my life So it’s hard to get high on this drug. Probably part of the point for me It’s starting to make more sense why this helps me so much. Apparently it doesn’t do the same for everyone but I don’t know where I’d be without it"

176103051,I had relapsed and had just gotten insight into my illness. My mind started to clear up but I was still pretty mentally sick. So I decided to educate myself on this illness and read and researched as much as I could and this website gave me a lot of hope for the future. I saw that I wasn’t the only one dealing with this illness and felt relieved that I had answers to a lot of problems that I was dealing with.
176103052,That’s so awesome! Having a good dr means so much!

176103057,"I started losing weight until i was put on depakote. Then I just stay the same, I did build more stamina walking like 2-3miles a day though. Didn’t walk today. Too afraid"
176103058,We were never certain of that. It was something we pondered about. I guess she may have noticed things and not been able to handle it very well. I told my father about going for an assessment. He looked at a few links and said he couldn’t see any signs . My stepdaughter has said he has some similar mannerisms/traits to me . If he never noticed while she did that might have made things difficult.

176103062,"They don’t just take you away for having symptoms. Trust me. They hospitalize you for being a dangerous threat to yourself or others. You can be having thoughts of harming yourself or others and still not be taken away. It’s only when you have a plan to hurt someone, that they will commit you. At other times they might recommend hospitalization, but you can say no. You’ll find that people say yes to give their loved ones a break. The other reason they hospitalize you is for functioning. When you stop functioning and meeting your basic needs, they will recommend hospitalization."

ATTACKING is a brutal and aggressive way, but mine is more of the gentle way mate. but thanks for pointing out mate, cause this reassures the person knows that I am not on the bad side or out to get her or something."
176103066,That doesn’t sound like a good review! Compared to the things they are saying about it…
176103067,Tell your pdoc about your apathy and depression. Maybe they could add an antidepressant that will help.

174368230,"Hello everyone. My name is ilovethaifood. I’d just like to take a moment to nominate _AT_MENTION_ to be a recipient of the “honorary schizophrenia” award. Goodness know over time the nominee has developed enough knowledge and research to be officially be recognized as an honorary schizophrenic. Esteemed Moonbeam, on behalf of every individual in this thread do you accept the title of “Honorary Schizophrenic”? Sure it’s not an honorary degree from Harvard but if you choose to accept, now and forever more on the forums found in this website, there will be no poster here henceforth that will question your state of sanity or reason for being here."
174368236,Hi _AT_MENTION_ Welcome to the forums. Important early to take the medications as prescribed and follow through with treatment. It does get better for most and most of us have been there before.

176103073,This is exactly why I decided to join this forum. I’m not certain if my beliefs are true and based in fact and reason or are completely delusional .
176103074,_AT_MENTION_ You like to post the goat video every 6 months and _AT_MENTION_ likes to post the dog video. Both were posted today. All is right with the universe. Even My Dog is Getting a Little Stir Crazy!
176103075,I have social anxiety myself. The other day my dad asked me if i thought i was on the autism spectrum. I didnt know. I was wondering _AT_MENTION_ if you had an opinion on this? what is autism compared to social anxiety? Are they the same
176103076,I stayed 4-6 months in one hospital stay as the psychiatrist extended my stay in court and bcz I tried escaping.
176103077,She kept getting sick and quit. It was a daycare she was working at. She quit to look for another job but now can’t find one. She’s learning disabled so she’s limited in options. Buying in bulk is a good idea. I may go to Costco to see the food prices.
174368238,Thank you all so much. I am currently taking capalyta and used to be on the abilify injection. Any reality checking is much appreciated.
176103078,Sometimes TV flirts with me or makes fun of me
176103079,"I understand the wintertime blues! I call it the gray! (Is it grey or gray?) lol, anyway my pdoc told me this is very common and it could be SAD (seasonal affective disorder). I live up north where the winter lasts so long and there’s months of nothing but total grayness! Fortunately during the holidays I get a boost of serotonin because the holidays make me feel so much happier, but the day after Xmas boom, it hits like a ton of bricks!"
176103080,"_PERSON_ I’m seeing how crappy my area is at employing people with serious mental illness. (Especially by comparison)At first when I actually got through the work rehab program. the first thing the guy said was “You have to look for the jobs yourself.” Like, what do you get paid for? Eventually they started showing me a job that I’d have to commute for over 90 minutes that I didn’t think I could do. Totally useless. But I don’t think the businesses I will be hiring myself out to for web design can easily find out about my dx."
176103081,"I know they’re called delusions, I can call them delusions, others do too, but I still have my questions. When my insight tanks on me, I forget they aren’t real."
176103082,Delusions are like normal thoughts. A deluded person can’t distinguish them
176103083,I hope im not feeding your delusion. But its usually IP cameras connected to the net that you can then look up. You can get one for about 40 dollors or pounds on amazon.But If you think your being watched or recorded - i can promise you faithfully that you probably are not.
176103084,"okay, I will tomorrow. How did you find out about it?"
174368240,What med are you on? Maybe you need a more energising one like abilify or something
176103085,"I’m not putting down those who can, rather., I’m criticising the “if I did it so can you” generalisation."
176103086,"_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ I am feeling better today. Less emotional. I finally got some quality sleep and had a talk with my husband. No, he’s not glad. He just knows me, and knows I’m done. He says he’s lost. I’m sad for him but it made me feel better. Isn’t that sick. He just seems so well adjusted about the whole thing. I think this is going to be good for him too. He spends so much of his energy worrying about me. This will be a fresh start for him too. And I think that’s great. He can focus on doing the things he loves, like fishing and hunting, the things I don’t care for. So yea, I’m feeling better. Thank you both for caring."
176103087,I believe this place also offers eeg test but I think more for research projects. But I can apply for the fmri one.
176103088,We still do apts on the phone here. Good luck!
176103089,I had that too in 2004. Now you’re not even allowed to smoke on the grounds!
176103090,I have an antique organ. It is at the least 1970 when my grand mother bought it.
176103091,My dad had dementia when his cancer spread to his brain. It was pretty scary to watch. I’m sorry you are dealing with this.
176103092,From what I read on here most people take antipsychotic and there symptoms go away Mine flare up once a week paranoia and voices
176103093,"As I recall, _PERSON_ said that there were patterns in music and poems that the authors didn’t consciously understand. The official theme song of Marvel’s “Avengers,” one of the most popular movie series of all time states: “We’re insane but not alone, We hold on, And let go” https://www.google.com/search?q=Avengers+live+to+rise Soundgarden - Live to Rise (From Marvel I see this statement as having some similarities to a _PERSON_ quote: BrainyQuote _NAME_ Quotes ""Success is how high you bounce when you hit..."" - _NAME_ quotes from BrainyQuote.com When I had my psychotic episode, that was pretty much at a low point in my life. But, I believe that I bounced. I went “insane,” but I “held on” to some things that were important to me, and “let go” of other things because of my low position in life. I believe that it may have helped me to focus and may help be to bounce higher, if it hasn’t already. So, what about you? Did pscyhosis and its aftermath help you to focus on wha
t is important? Did you “bounce?” I was psychotic before. I focused more on what was important. I bounced. I was psychotic, but I don’t feel that I focused or bounced. I was psychotic, and of course I had to focus on important things to survive after that, but I don’t believe I bounced. I bounced with no focus. What are you talking about? Take your meds! I was never psychotic. Why am I posting in the diagnosed SZ/SZA section? I’m still psychotic. Your encoded message is correct. I am an alien. 0 voters"
176103094,yes I did it stopped me from wanting to do anything spiritual ever again for some time it was profound and I believe it totally nothing to do with psychosis this experience is in essence the true reality and is religious I felt I found it had a very heavy effect on my life because it made me feel I couldn’t handle anything like I had lost control or simply bonked running long distance I shut off all the experiences from everything spiritual and worried the hell out of my family I am now 8 yrs after being completely frozen takeing a course in mindfulness for beginners for people with mental health difficulties. in a way it was negative. it cut my belief system away from anyone I know at the time I had no real friends in the community and therefore my family have HUGE alarm bells when I say I might do yoga again I did about 20 years of spiritual practice in some form kundalini is not recommended for people with mental health difficulties
176103095,"Yes, I can relate. My teenage years were rough to begin with, but around 17 I had a nervous breakdown and went into a major depressive episode for about 2 years. I tore the cartilage in my knee at my first job, and was on crutches for 18 months while waiting for surgery. During that time, I watched all my friends move on making money, buying their first car, and being free to enjoy life It sucked at the time, but I’m still here and doing fairly well now. Don’t throw in the towel on yourself"
176103096,yeah it sucks thinking all the time that your going to get tortured forever one day for nothing
176103097,I was shattered because I realized I had like the worst mental disorder you can have. I spent weeks crying about never being able to reach my potential. Then I got over the grief and started just being content with whatever happiness I can squeeze out of each day.
174368241,That’s what my ex told me. And I’m really curious what she thinks a schizophrenic looks like? He shouts? He moves without purpose? He can’t talk properly?
176103098,Best of luck _AT_MENTION_ !
176103099,I hope you feel better soon _AT_MENTION_

When he got me to the right house I had a hand full of nightcrawlers and an old baby doll that I must have dug out of the mud that I wouldn’t let go of because I thought it was a real baby that I saved. I was drenched to the bone and it took awhile for me to snap back into reality and realize that things were not as I imagined them. Now it feels as though it was a dream and I was sleepwalking. I never did get over my embarrassment of meeting the new maintenance man that way and not exactly sure where I got the baby doll."

And this was the guy who’d introduced himself to me as being “psychotic” on my first day there."

176103118,I dont think we live in a simulation i think we live in a material world. If the universe just so happens to recreate itself again and again because this is just what is in the realm of possibility then I think it could be a simulation and everything simulacra in that sense. But the notion that the simulation takes place inside a computer or something is ridiculous. Its evident to me that perception stems from multicellular life and the intricacies of our biology that are still beyond our undetstanding simply would not be necessary if a computer was providing the mechanics behind our thought. Its ridiculous to argue that a simulation simulates all the processes of biomolecular life including disorderly processes that give rise to schizophrenia just to generate our perceptions. We simply live in a material world and chemical and physical laws give rise to our perceptions through complex interactions that arnt computed but occur independently in a void where they require no processing power or memory 
to occur. Its just material in a void interacting with other material sometimes in a complex way.

176103133,Why not take antipsychotic if you have psychotic symptoms
176103134,I think it would make more sense if you remained on the Risperdal and was given another medication to treat your anxiety than switching APs. It’s best to have this discussion with your doctor. Good luck

I can’t donate money because I don’t have any. It’s so stupid. I do what I can, so why the fúck do I feel so guilty, as if these ideas in my head are memories, or possibly soon to come?

I recall a senior whispering that to the other girls in front of me…I never told anyone I had schizophrenia so I felt pretty isolated and miserable. Leading up to my relapse I was going to class in sweatshirts with upside down crosses, got called to the Principals office for having bright siren red hair; and they were becoming more right-wing republican so I’m glad I left. Waste of time. HS really is a waste of time for some of us."

174368267,"I didnt have insight. When I was little I had vivid visual and auditory hallucinations and both grandiose and paranoid delusions. As I got older I stopped getting the auditory and visual for a while but then in highschool the visual came back and changed to become more trippy in nature, and was primarily floating colorful lights amidst other things. At in my mid teens my psychosis became pretty severe. I became known as a weirdo at school, I was completely absorbed in delusions and started experiencing being tortured and abused by demons/evil spirits, which gave me ptsd. As a young adult I finally gained some insight which helped me learn to cope. When I got out of highschool I could arrange my schedule to where I could get a good amount of sleep and that helped make my symptoms much milder. The worst of the abuse stopped though it did still go on for years in different forms. My visuals changed as a young adult again and now along with trippy stuff I saw people or animals in public that would appe
ar for a couple seconds then vanish. Currently age 25 I still have the delusion that I’m going to be a warrior in the apocalypse sometimes but mostly it is at the back of my mind, I don’t think of it often and when I do I can realize it is a delusion. I rarely hallucinate anymore unless I’m really tired. The abuse has stopped and I’m finally not being regularly terrorized by demons for the first time in 8 years. I do still struggle with some negative symptoms like not being motivated to perform hygiene, but my boyfriend helps me with that. Overall things are doing pretty good."

176103196,"It recalls me the first delusion of paranoia I had. I started to think people at college were actors who wanted to capture me. I tried to question these beliefs when giving a presentation at classroom: “I think I’m not well and my brain is playing tricks.” Then I went to the bathroom and I thought a guy was following me. After the overwhelming experience I went home by bus. I thought a woman in the bus worked for these actors and I followed her. I think she went to a hairdresser, then I went home. At home, I got calmer and felt better and, after some time (maybe right in the next day, can’t remember exactly), I had no feelings of paranoia anymore. But after some time I had it again at the internship I was doing and then it stopped. If I’m not wrong, I may had had 1-2 days of delusions followed by 1 month of confusion and depression. Then, one day, I started to frequently have delusions and I flirted with the idea of creating my own words. I used these words with other people, but they cou
ldn’t understand. Then my speech got even more disorganized. After around 1 week I was hospitalized. I remember that right when things were getting really messy and I used to cry tons of tears, I got hospitalized. So, even if delusions aren’t happening continuosly, they are a red flag."

176103206,The second book I’m going to recommend is “The Scientific Basis of Astrology” by the astronomer and astrophysicist _NAME_ a review of which can be found here: http://www.mountainman.com.au/astrology_01.htm _NAME_’s book is as much about biology as it is about astrophysics and provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the scientifically proven biological influences of the stars on animals behaviour as well as some forward thinking speculation on further theories to investigate. There is no reference to classical astrological theory and no attempt to justify it. Rather the author seeks a new focus on astrology on the basis that the heavens do indeed have a biological effect on determining behaviour. This is one of the few books I have managed to finish recently and I would recommend it to anyone with an enquiring scientific bent. Thank you.

The neighbour said she hated herself, And said that she dreamt of something Not of this world, But this world is far from her dreams, the neighbour said.

For example I pretend as if happy and actually start to feel happy then the next moment if I pretend sad, face frown etc I can feel sadness even though seconds before i made happy feeling. This goes for other emotions like anger and others. If I not make any emotion I automatically go to zombie mode with flat face and no emotion. Anyone able to shift their moods, emotions rapidly like this? The thing is it not coming automatically like bipolar, depression etc instead manually creating and can shift moods and emotions any time I want. Regards"

Be forewarned medications aren’t a fix all, they have downsides and you’re going to want to give them probably several of them, a try and look for one that gives you the best result. I know personally that it took 2 years before I felt relatively good, and a couple months per medication to find out if I thought I was better off, with the support of my families observations. Now I feel like I’ve got a good handle on things and now I just need to handle how I get from disability to functioning as a productive person and finding a partner and a career path that I can manage or evaluate if work won’t fit me due to stress responses."
176103326,Depends on the person. Depends on what your normal diet is. Depends on the vitamin. If you have a healthy diet you should get enough vitamins from what you eat. Then you have professionals who want you to take “mega doses” of stuff like vitamin C. They make claims about how great taking huge doses of vitamin C is for you. While other professionals dispute that claim and say it doesn’t help. If you have a deficiency of some vitamin like vitamin D for example then taking vitamin D supplements is good. I don’t have figures on how much you need of each specific vitamin or mineral. That’s up to you to figure out by talking to your GP or researching online.

I found therapy ??????? useless. I have found that a lot of stuff can be mitigated by making changes to work, or other things in your life. Medication can also help a lot, but you have got to start somewhere. Psych wards are not nice places to be, and are reserved for very serious cases. I know you might have a thought that they’re places of solace in a time of need, but in reality these places have become holding cells for people who’re a danger to themselves or other people. Keep trying to make your life better. It seems you’re trying this already, so you’re making the first few positive steps, as well as having insight - which is a massive bonus!"
176103399,"thx moonbeam, i do mention my volunteering and caring for my mum but the community garden thing might be too much for me this year, i’m thinking about giving my plot to someone else this year. I did that too and had the same experience, i am trying to just message women that are online rather than swiping a picture now, i have had a couple of short chats but not met anyone yet, certainly better than swiping, if you ask me swiping doesnt work"

176103403,"I walked around with this affliction for some time. Not a good place to be, lots of paranoia. Speak to a doctor. If these sorts of things go on for a long period of time, you might find other things might come into play, and you don’t want that. Untreated psychosis is not good at all. Not saying that’s what you have, but I can relate to this specific experience very strongly, as I had it for years."

176103417,"I’ve been thinking lately (uh oh, here we go ): What are our roles as psychosis experiencers in modern society? On a micro-level we are brothers, daughters, parents, etc., but what kind of role do we play in society as a whole? I would argue that mental illness is undoubtedly marginalized in society, and as a result, many of us are forced to either assimilate into mainstream roles or remain on the outskirts. Is assimilation our only ticket to inclusion? Or, by way of educating the public on our condition, can we not only live integrated lives, but also wear the badge of having experienced psychosis proudly? Maybe my thoughts are scattered; I’ll admit, I have no one but you guys to really bounce these ideas off of at the moment… So maybe I’m just thinking out loud. I guess my questions are: How do you think society sees us? How can we carve out a role for ourselves in society (if there’s even room)?"

Recently went to hear a friend play at a place called Artichoke Pizza (weird name), and they had the most incredible pizza I’d had in quite awhile.

176103435,Mate. Sounds horrible and not much fun. If anything comes of it apologize but stand your ground. Your doing things to make her feel welcome and that is cool. Not your fault if she doesn’t react well. See what happens from this. If she moves out that wouldn’t be a bad thing. If she comes back then lay some ground rules… I lived out for a large part of my life and I couldn’t afford it without help. I usually used friends but even with people you know you lay some ground rules to make it work. If you don’t you end up getting screwed. It’s not an easy thing. Sorry it’s come to this but do what you can to look after yourself first. Your not an evil being. Your a decent guy and even then everyone has a bad day!

The society hates those who are marginalized, And no one hears the screams of the weak. They give us mobility aids and medication And attempt to silence our voice. They put blindfolds over their heads And they plug their ears. The world, and the society is for those with Two legs and two arms, ten fingers and ten toes, With a sane mind and with flowing hair. The society hates the marginalized, and we simply suffer in silence. We just simply try to get by, Eat whatever we find, and enjoy our minds While we glance out the window with troubled hope."

That pissed me off so much because the insinuation was that I was crazy for getting mad. I was never sure if she deliberately did that knowing how it made me feel, but it always felt like an insult to me. My whole family has been supportive throughout my 38 years with this disease and she only did that in the beginning but eventually stopped."

176103564,"I had difficulty with the PD diagnoses that were given. 1st PD NOS & then paranoid PD . Those were clear examples of something that happens all too often in psychiatry . A patient is not liked, and thus a PD dx is attached to him or her. If the sz-a dx had been kept and avoidant pd had been added that would have been far better."
176103565,If it helps I’ve felt exactly the same and so currently. I’m off my meds but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. As intriguing as psychosis can be when you’re not psychotic its hell when you get there. You know?

174368351,"i was initially diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features, when i was unable to sleep for six days and ended up in a state psych ward for two weeks. the next pshyciatrist caled me schizoaffective, for the next nine years. then he died. then i saw a nurse practitioner for a few months, and she called me schizophrenic. i told her stressful events trigger my mood to elevate, but i guess she didn’t consider that important enough to keep the old diagnosis. today i just saw another nurse practitioner and she insisted i’ve always been schizophrenic. she also said i can’t be bipolar too. i thnk she is just splitting hairs saying i can’t be bipolar too, as if it should just be called schizoaffective but not both those things. but i wonder if she would conceded i may be schizoaffective. i think it’s obvious i am. i wonder if she just saw the old diagnosis and went with it. i doubt she went through my records much. if i stopped taking medication i know i’d have an elevated mood and inability 
to sleep a lot. i strongly suspect my psychosis would increase, but i’m not a hundred percent sure of that. i trust the two psych docs ive seen for a lot longer than this nurse who saw me for ten minutes. what are all ya’ll’s experiences?"

Before you know it, you’re operating in a different place.” (_NAME_ and _NAME_) This is what I say in the weight loss thread - I make one meal’s good decision at a time, and it’s adding up to a lot as the days go by.

174368380,"For most of my life I have just not wanted to do the things that I felt society expects me to do. Usually if I did anything like that it would be pretty begrudgingly. I always thought I wanted to think my own way, and I think I considered rejecting social norms/conventions to be the right way to be an individual and an independent thinker. Being this way seems to have only caused me lingering problems in the long run though, and I think now I tend to think I was just wrong about things all the way through, and it’s left me kind of dead inside. Sometimes I think that feeling this way is the reason why I barely have opinions about anything anymore, other than the basic sense of whether I like something or not. Anyway, has anyone else here felt the same way about social norms/conventions? How do you think it affected you? Do you think it’s related to developing schizophrenia?"
176103650,"That was an interesting video, thanks for sharing"
176103651,I think I am when taking my circumstances into account. I actually think everyone is reaching their full potential why would someone want to suffer I think we all try the best we can in our own ways to not suffer. And so go in the opposite direction. _PERSON_

176103654,"did you see florida just raised the state minimum wage to $15/hr, i wonder if things will get more expensive there. and i do anticipate they will legalize weed in the next 10 years though. but i have family there, and it’s warm, i could maybe afford a 1 bedroom condo, semi close to the beach. its crazy, condos there are cheaper than my hometown where a 2bedroom 2 bath place goes for no less 170k. and i think why would i buy that when i can be on the beach. of course there are hurricanes to worry about. and if i ever get a horticulture degree, i could work on a golf course year round and wouldnt get laid off each winter. but i sometimes have the same thought as you, that i can’t wait to get into a 55 and over community haha."

176103660,"en.m.wikipedia.org Dysfunctional family A dysfunctional family is a family in which conflict, misbehavior, and often child neglect or abuse on the part of individual parents occur continuously and regularly, leading other members to accommodate such actions. Children sometimes grow up in such families with the understanding that such a situation is normal. Dysfunctional families are primarily a result of two adults, one typically overtly abusive and the other codependent, and may also be affected by addictions (such as substance abuse,..."

174368377,"Many enlightened beings, had visions, voices, had constant derealization, had no ego boundaries, like schizophrenics etc. And as i told you, enlightened beings get sick too.

174368381,"haha his name is gray legs, he was born this may so hes young. but I don’t think I am schizophrenic because besides all these words im hearing in my head I don’t have any other symptom, I was just thinking maybe its a tulpa"

176103680,"Because there’s a chance. It’s also probably bigger than small, the medical community tends to cater to the lowest common denominator and often suppresses recovery. It’s more cost efficient."
176103681,"Good luck _AT_MENTION_! It isn’t easy, both my parents used to smoke so I’ve seen how hard it can be. However, should you fall of the wagon, get up and try again. Research has shown it takes on average 12 attempts before being successful."

176103685,"I haven’t always been a nice person. I’ve said and done some pretty nasty things. All of it was pre psychosis too, so I really had no excuse"
176103686,"Honestly, it’ll never be an easy thing to admit. The problem is that you need to admit it now, because if you wait, there’s no guarantee that you’ll have the capacity to admit it later. I’m not trying to frighten you, but you’re right to be concerned. Psychosis is serious business, and you’re already sounding a bit disorganized. Things can go downhill quickly. It’s important that you tell your dad right now so that you can get ahead of this. The longer you wait, the more likely it is that you’ll lose insight. You need to tell him right away."
176103687,Eating fewer processed carbs helps.
176103688,Try resume.com . I used it once before. But I think I had to pay a very small fee to print it. But I just checked the site and it said free so maybe you don’t have to pay at all anymore.

176103693,I’m pretty casual mostly but some people get under my skin. I do well ignoring it most times but every now and then I act out a bit. I’m not happy about that but I’m learning. I’m teaching myself to walk away more and avoid confrontation.
176103694,Awesome! Congratulations
176103695,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I don’t feel “gay”,just my thread was about whether your look on your partner can change within years.I’m to inhibited emotionally to know that right now,but the fact that I’m no longer scared of being close to someone who understands me doesn’t include that it always have to be opposite sex."

176103697,"Yeah, it would be great if we could run back the clock to 2008. At that point I had only been on this drug for 5 or 6 years and did not experience severe withdrawals if I missed a dose for an hour past feeding time. It would be great to have that level of faith in authority figures again. Not."
176103698,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_. I am glad to be home. Watching “Ink Masters”
176103699,no these tribunals occur about 3 weeks after youve been involuntarily committed to a psychiatirc hospital…it is a review to determine whether you should be released or not…the tribunal has an independent psychiatrist and another professional and a layperson present to determine whether you should be released or not
176103700,I figure wait and see.
176103701,"Wait, so you have to pay for your meds? What meds are you on, and how much do they cost? Also the USA needs free healthcare funded by tax. Doesn’t make sense not to, considering it’s a wealthy country."
176103702,I want to overcome this too It goes a bit with my cycle… up down up down Seem to not maintain the ups
176103703,There are quite a lot there waiting to be assessed/self diagnosed/ thinking they might be on the spectrum and checking things out . It is not mandatory to have an official diagnosis before posting . I joined and posted several years before I got my diagnosis .
176103704,it sucks that they aren’t more clear =/ if it’s not sza and sz then it’s prob bipolar huh… Why are they not clear to you?
176103705,I think Im gonna get the vaccine. I really hope it doesn’t have any undesirable long-term effects.
176103706,I try to be kind. Open doors etc but with covid that’s kind of frowned on and it’s hard to see a smile with a mask on.
176103707,"Yeah its hard because my symptoms/episodes are transient and brought on more fully by stress. I have a muscle condition and have had paranoid schizophrenia since being fifteen. When I was working at a warehouse I thought everything was a conspiracy because I was stressed and working night shifts. I didn’t do a full week of work the entire time but I did get paid and they didn’t try to fire me because it was a seasonal job. I see now how my cognitive impairments are getting in the way, it’s getting worse all the time. I really feel robbed by this stupid disease. I tried my whole life to work and finish college my whole life was work work work finish finish finish and I failed. If I get rejected for this its just further proof the systems rigged against me."
176103708,"I think the “Truth” movement has been so stupid about how they treat vaping. All their public service announcements focus on is that you’re “4 times more likely to start smoking real tobacco if you vape.” So the most dangerous thing about vaping is choosing not to vape? Yeah, nice message. If you ask me they should have embraced it as a safer alternative or just left it alone. Of course some might say vaping is dangerous too, there were all those news stories about vapers coming down with weird lung problems, but if that’s the case than the Truth movement should be focusing on that instead of how likely you are to pick up a real cigarette."
174368393,"My fiancée is so supportive, she’s learned my triggers, stressors, tons about this illness, and goes to my Pdoc with me so I can have secondary input on my behavior. A “how I’m feeling” and “how he’s acting” I find it helps. Finding love and support isn’t impossible."
176103709,"Latuda was the first AP I tried. It worked pretty ok for a little while. It caused terrible akathesia, though. My doctor prescribed Cogentin to help with the akathesia."
174368383,This sounds like schizophrenia talking. Have you spoken with your psychiatrist?
176103710,Same here. In my own head too much!
176103711,I never sh!t myself before taking antipsychotics.
176103712,"You absolutely are not a parasite. It isn’t your fault you have sz. It is a nasty illness to have and one that is bloody hard to work with. I’m sure if people were asked if they mind their tax money going to help someone with a chronic condition like sz, I’m positive most would support it."
176103713,I guess youre righr
176103714,I guess it’s just the little love I get from people and the belief that God still wants me around for some reason.
176103715,I’m having a real problem with jealousy right now and I have never been so suicidal as now. I find myself reacting into a very “I am special” state of mind that could only chase people away.
176103716,I’m really worried about talking nonsense delusional stuff here
176103717,Looks cool interesting catch22 Glad to see ya around
176103718,"I want to be able To blame someone For all this, Or at least part."
174368384,I’m just worried that I’m not schizophrenic and this is all real.
176103719,They reacted badly
176103720,I am working on setting up a podcast at some point. I have a mood journal but it’s tough finding the motivation.
176103721,"I have another near death experience for you _AT_MENTION_ , I was only four this time. I was having a bath happily playing away with my rubber duck and other “toys” when my tyrant father came in and started yelling at me. He pulled me from the bath and smacked my bottom so hard. He was yelling at me “WHY DID YOU DO THAT”, it turns out that I had pooed in the bath and was playing boats with my poop. Again, this is a true story. When you are four poop makes an excellent boat, it floats so well."
176103722,Sorry to hear that. It sounds awful.
176103723,The first few days on diet are soo difficult. Right now I just feel like making cheese sandwich. My brain is still habituated to that kind of food. Might give in. Not sure. My excuse would be that I should start diet on a Monday not Thursday
174368404,never heard of muscarinic receptors before
176103724,Anyone who thinks like this shouldn’t be allowed a gun.
176103725,"I am more scared of another psychotic break than I used to be, just because the Zyprexa has been such a miracle for me. I was on three other APs and was still very sick, now the Zyprexa has me practically normal functioning for the past three months. I know I’m still sick underneath that though, and I am worried about all the goodness being taken away from me again. If the Zyprexa lets another psychotic break come through, I am in big trouble. I wouldn’t know how to handle it at all. I am also job hunting to get off disability, I would be in a lot of pain if I had to be psychotic while working again. I have to just trust in the miracle of the Zyprexa to keep me well."
176103726,"I think I figured it out. i went to preferences, then under notifications I clicked categories section, I had the lounge category as watch. I don’t remember doing this. maybe by accident and it’s only happened today. just had to delete like 20 emails for things I hadn’t even read or responded to."
174368390,"I had a horrible time on vraylar, didn’t sleep 5 days at a time, then would literally crash. Careful cause there’s a 50/50 split on people with insomnia on it. And your insurance may not wanna pay for it."
176103727,"I live alone. I do group therapy over zoom 3x a week. I do one on one therapy once a week. I have 3 day over the weekend when I have no structure to my day at all. I notice that during those 3 days I have problems that have to be worked out in the next week lol. Sometimes I wish I had less structure, or that I didn’t need it. But I definitely see the importance of it in my life to keep me stable."
176103728,I only read it for the breasts.
176103729,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . A lot of therapists are arrogant know it all’s. It’s hard to find a good one.
176103730,"I chewed nicotine gum all the time when I quit smoking. I just kept lowering the dose after a few weeks, and after three months I was done with nicotine all together. Dont be afraid to use nicotine aids to help you quit. I quit April 12th 2018, and I was a heavy smoker. Good luck!"
176103731,SSRI’s are the go to for impulse control problems. I dont like SSRI’s though. I have trichotillomania
176103732,Sometimes I get random thoughts that I feel the need tk act on. Like for example j was walking earlier and remembered j used to not walk on cracks years ago from fear of something badhappening. So j avoided cracks. An hour later I can tell myself that’s dumb and am walking on cracks. Why am I like this? Whenever things like this happen j feel like its evidence I’m faking this whole thing.
176103733,I see. Be careful .
176103734,Good luck to you.

176103740,"the psychiatrist asked me about cognitive decline and I replied,“Well I recently became an octochamp on countdown which is better than average.” I am not as sharp as I was, but I am still fighting my corner being diagnosed over 25 years ago."
176103741,"Minding my own business going out for some milk. And some teenager called me a dick! Now im paranoid. Maybe she picked up on my nerves outside - i dunno. Or maybe she knows im from the pub - and ive fallen out with them, cos ive stopped going down cos i quit - and the landlady is pissed off losing my £150 a week down there. And people wonder why i prefer to stay indoors! Someone please tell me im over reacting! Im 44 for Gods sake - i should be able to handle a crappy comment from a snarky teenager!"
176103742,Close _PHONE_NO_
176103743,I can sympathise a lot with the post. When I meet people very often the first thing they want to know after they ask me my name is what I do. And its always awkward no matter how its answered. Its more or less impossible to get a date as someone who doesnt work. Women just aren’t interested. I feel lucky that I’ve met women who were in similar situations to me who could relate to me and take me as I am. But generally - if you want to get a date it seems like earning an income is top of the list.
176103744,I have never had anything like that.
174368399,Rexulti is very similar to Abilify. My psy said its in the same family as Abilify and has similar side effects. Abilify gave me bad side effects so he said he won’t prescribe me Rexulti.
176103745,I also take meds for my heart rate. I’m sure it’ll be a good med for you.
176103746,"I agree that SZ is not free pass to crime but its much more complicated than this. Psychiatrists are involved in court to decide if the subject is insane. For me I go insane when unmedicated, I become easily irritable, nervous, paranoid, delusional and hallucinate. In extreme cases I could kill myself and even ppl. I already tried killing myself 3 times and was very close with liver damage. Psychiatrists take into consideration if the patient is medicated and stable on his meds. Observer was on his meds but only his psychiatrist knows if he’s stable. Truth is that sh!t happens in life but luckily its rare."

176103749,I was on meds 2 weeks ago how its possible to be having delusions??
176103750,"I haven’t had that happen to me for a while, but I’ve had it in the past. For example, I once heard voices whispering in the other room, talking to each other. But it was too quiet to understand."
176103751,Why did _AT_MENTION_ s post get flagged? Hmmmmmm…

176103755,Of putting my compression stockings on is not going well. I’m such a procrastinator. They are such a pain in the ass. However I believe they are helping. You’d think that would give me some kind of incentive. But alas no.
176103756,I hope war in Syria doesn’t get as bad as in Iraq. It was pretty bad in Iraq. I just hate seeing ppl fighting or dying.
176103757,I felt better here because I was dealing with more psychosis than mood stuff for a long long time. So it was easier to find people to relate to here.
176103758,My man! That’s outstanding.
176103759,it is not invention it is just lemon juice but make sure lemon is 3 lemons only to avoid make it bitter taste less than this juice will be very diluted more than this will be bitter 6 equivalent tea spoons of sugar or diet sugar 1 litre cold water you can drink it all day or like me if you love drinks you can drink twice per day it will be good actually i drink 2- 3 times coz i love it what about the dose of vitamin c never worry about that either you drink one litre or two per day make sure you love it so you ll drink it often and afterthat you can take your vitamin c dose easily that is the most important

176103763,I don’t like my family. My sister in law taunted me about being unemployed in a barely veiled way and my brother did nothing. He didn’t even apologize on her behalf. My mom has said some negative things regarding recovery but she’s no longer in the driver’s seat. I no longer care much what they think.

176103767,All antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia but it depends on the dosage. Typical APs cause more TD. Latuda is not a typical AP. Its because APs block dopamine receptors.

I try reading but nothing holds my attention.

176103774,I haven’t had any luck with supplements. Two of them made me worse but I don’t remember what they were. Another one made my tremors come back even though I take meds for that. I tried that broccoli stuff though and I just threw it away. I threw all that other stuff away too. L lysine. The theanine you are talking about. And sarcosine. And pregnemelone or something like that. All was bad news.

Neurocognitive insight (NI), described as awareness of neurocognitive deficits, has not been evaluated in the Indian context. Its relation to clinical profile and social functioning also remains unexplored.The aim of this study was to evaluate the subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) and their relation to objective cognitive performance, clinical profile, clinical insight, and social functioning in patients of schizophrenia.This was a cross-sectional study at the outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital.One hundred individuals with schizophrenia were evaluated using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Subjective Scale To Investig
ate Cognition in Schizophrenia, abbreviated version of Scale to Assess Unawareness in Mental Disorders, and Schizophrenia Research Foundation-Social Functioning Index. Cognitive performance was assessed using (1) Digit Span Test (attention) from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition and (2) Passages Test (explicit memory), (3) Verbal n-back Test (working memory), and (4) Stroop Test (executive functioning) from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences Battery.Statistical analysis was done using descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests, and Pearson's coefficient of correlation.Participants showed impairment in all cognitive domains. Except for working memory, there was no correlation between SCC and objective performance for other cognitive domains correspondingly, implying poor NI. Severity of psychosis and clinical insight did not have any correlation with SCC. Higher SCC correlated with poorer social functioning, especially in ""occupational"" and ""other social roles"" domains
.Individuals with schizophrenia have poor NI. This is independent of severity of psychosis or clinical insight into illness. Socio-occupational functioning and depression should be actively enquired into when patients present with SCC."

It only tests your ability to take a GRE test. And also, get the documentation you need to get special accommodations. The test is very long, you will be staring at a screen for 4 hours and have very few breaks, but also constantly being reminded how much time has passed. I am a naturally good test taker, and got an 1860 (1400 without the writing portion) on my SAT without even studying. The GRE is a hellscape like no other. Do not assume you will do well because you have a tendency to ace tests. Take whatever boosts you can get."

I don’t really think much about her anymore but sometimes I’m reminded of her and then I feel her again I think cos she reminds me of me so we kind of resonate in my opinion It makes me wonder if she is still conscious but idk it could just be me It’s sad because she was only in her twenties and she reminded me of me somehow

Schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) are used to detect genetic associations to key clinical phenotypes in schizophrenia. We explored the associations between schizophrenia PRS and apathy levels in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n = 281) and matched healthy controls (n = 298), and further how schizophrenia PRS contributed to predicting apathy when added to premorbid and clinical factors in the patient sample.Schizophrenia PRS were computed for each participant. Apathy was assessed with the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Bivariate correlation analyses were used to investigate associations between schizophrenia PRS and apathy, and between apathy, premorbid and clinica
l factors. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were employed to evaluate the contributions of clinical variables and schizophrenia PRS to apathy levels.We found no significant associations between schizophrenia PRS and apathy in patients and healthy controls. Several premorbid and clinical characteristics significantly predicted apathy in patients, but schizophrenia PRS did not.Since the PRS are based on common genetic variants, our results do not preclude associations to other types of genetic factors. The results could also indicate that environmentally based biological or psychological factors contribute to apathy levels in schizophrenia."

But you need to get a game plan down You have to be so precise with what you eat and drink Currently taking _NAME_ Going to the gym every other day Working out and cardio Mixed with yoga and breath work Along taking Daily essential nutrients Practicing compassion Having a sponsor to catch anything odd Having the ability to trust this person(sponser) Meditation Subliminal affirmations Tons of self help reading Processing trauma Psychology books Reason exstensivley Also living in a slow pace environment filled with nature to forest bathe And going to various therapies It’s a lot of work And even doing all of this It’s going to be hard You have to reduce really slow too! Never cold turkey A lot of it is a leap of faith And you are going to have to find something to believe in and chop down reasons why you would even want to go off meds and if it’s even worth it What will happen if you go psychotic?! Do small tapers!!! Just in case And go 
slow! Really slow And extra pyramidal is Parkinsonism! Anyways Good luck pm me if you’d like to know more

My advice is to hold fire - time heals everything You will eventually see your negatives disappearing and a renewed motivation - it just takes time You need the full support of your mental health team and family at this time - try talking to a family member about how you feel People used to tell me to snap out of it but I appreciate it’s not as easy as that. With _PERSON_ it’s like a brick wall in front of you stopping you from doing anything"
176103889,"I was seeing a pdoc that it seemed he began with the assumption I was self deluded. I think a number of pdoc’s are quick to conclude that their patients are deluded. In a lot of cases I think psych patients are deluded, but I think pdoc’s should grant more to the patient than that."

174368439,"I make use of daily schedules or habits to make the rhythm going. Nothing comes automatically like getting up from bed at morning and going to bed at sleep time. Need to force myself to do every needed thing. If not force then I keep sit, stand or lie for as long as it goes. If follow the habit daily then its easy to go along with it otherwise it requires tremendous effort and energy to do these even simple things like brushing teeth. I think the reason for all these is because of lack of thoughts in mind. Thoughts remind people to do things even when they do other activities. While when negative symptoms come these thoughts which previously remained when doing activities reduced and even absent."

174368441,I am trying to find things I can do with my severe negative symptoms.
176103906,i thought the broadcasting was real - until i googled it under Sz. And the meds helped alot as well. Like has been said - its just another sort of delusion that we seem to be prone to. I never got so bad as too think it was some conspiracy or im “special” or rubbish like that. It just wasnt logical.
176103907,I wasn’t diagnosed until late 2016 – so my prodromal phase lasted about 6 years. I was basically just in limbo during that time.

In fact, the chances are you have a serious brain disorder and you need some help with the meds. Talk to your doctor and tell them these things. It’s a cruel master that paranoia and it prevents you from living. Get some help."

176103936,"Hey everybody, I’ve been looking on the internet for stories of women who have gotten pregnant after being on Invega and I can’t find ANYTHING which is very scary. I was on it for about 6 months. Off it now for about 2 months. My period became almost nothing on Invega, like barely bleeding for a day or so. Now 2 months off my period is a tiny bit heavier but no cramps. My concern is that my fertility is forever wrecked. I read in another thread about men losing their ability to have erections or ejaculate for years and that scared the bejeesus out of me. Oh yeah, I also have no sex drive and numbing of sensations down there. Any females out there gotten pregnant after invega? Or regained sexual ability after losing it?"

Of course, I’m 60 years old. But if it wasn’t for the med’s I could still do a lot of the things I did when I was young. When I was young any time I felt like it I could do 2,000 repetitions on the jump rope, and I never missed. I could still do that if it wasn’t for my med’s. My only gripe against Geodon is that it weakens me physically."
176103940,"…as a nursing student not a patient! Seeing the people there…wow…these are people who are very, very ill. The sickest of the sick. Mostly schizophrenics. Many with a history of trauma, very broken people. They look like absolute zombies. Very unkempt and just shuffling around with blank looks on their faces. The hospital itself is like a prison. Highly depressing and in my opinion not a very therapeutic environment. The dayroom was this giant room with some couches and tables and a nurse’s station and nothing else. It was just sad for me to see. Most of the people in there apparently had been there a long time and were basically going to be there for their whole lives. To me they had little chance of recovery. The children’s ward was better decorated at least and more cheerful looking. In my opinion it did not really have mentally ill children but rather highly traumatized children from very broken families that could not care for them and they just had nowhere else to go. They seemed lik
e such sweet typical children but they had issues with mood regulation and impulse control thus were prone to violent and explosive outbursts whenever mildly upset or distressed. Many of them also had learning disabilities due to mother’s drug use while they were in utero. I was on the children’s ward for my first day. It made me so sad that I cried during my report at the end of the day. Even though those kids parents sucked they were still so sad when they wouldn’t visit them. And there was really no therapeutic activities for the kids. They went to school during the day and occasionally met with a therapist and a doctor. I was told by the nurse that many of the kids end up in the hospital system their whole life as well. I don’t think I could work in an environment like that. Even though those places are understaffed and desperately need people. It is too depressing. And dangerous too, there are many, many violent individuals there, even outside of the criminal ward. Even the children I’ve heard 
can do some pretty bad damage when it comes to biting and whatnot. Next time I’m either going to be on the adult or criminal ward. I’ll let you know any more stories!"
176103941,LS! Two weeks ago I bought a smartwatch/stepcounter (for 30 euro). Now I monitor how many steps I walk. I fast Thursdays and Sundays and then I have a low activity level. Just 1300 steps. On days that I eat I average 7000 steps plus exercise either dumbbells or rowing machine. I am still in the process of figuring out as to how many steps I should walk to lower my chances of early death.

176103946,"I have got a lot better since I stopped hearing voices. I am not even that quiet these days, but it is hard when you are trying to have a conversation but instead of thinking of something to say you have to deal with your voices or you have a thought that is paranoid or self conscious."

176103949,Part of why I feel guilty is I used to go on these web forums years ago and I sort of related to what a lot of people went through here except for hearing voices. Then I think I brought attention to myself when I really didn’t have a problem and now I feel like this is my karma that I can’t tell whether I really have this problem or not.

174368450,"I emailed the company that makes the DSM. I told them the mandatory positivity campaign going on during the 2007 recession Just makes us look lazy and told them calling them negative symptoms is not helpful because too many people think we’re being negative when we say we can’t do something. You associate laziness as a negative personality trait. They need to call it like low dopamine symptoms or something. Explaining it to my family member almost immediately pushes them away from me, because you say you have negative symptoms and they think it means your being negative with excuses"

That when you get out, say you’re going on public transport to a homeless shelter but you are dropped off to a place with locked doors and no lights on? (I walked for an hour or so, found a public phone and guilted a relative into taking me in. I’d done nothing to her but it’s clear, only the fact I used guilt tactics prevented her from leaving me there) I have. All 3 were the same psych ward I went to twice. Been to a psych ward where they can’t get you a shave every day? Where they reduce the only medicine that ever helped you in response to a perceived crisis? Been there, done that. Those two were the same one. Different one from the first one. Been slapped in restraints in total darkness while never making a threat? (I was a minor too) Things are bad here. I intend to stay away from these places for the rest of my life. Anybody have similar experiences and want to vent?"

174368446,I have had a hard time with suicidal ideation in the past. For some reason if I take Rexulti it makes it stop. I guess it’s because Rexulti acts sort of like an anti-depressant. Other anti-depressants didn’t work to stop the ideation the way the Rexulti does. I just take 3mg and it works for me. I actually think 2mg would work too and may go down a little here in the future.

176103997,_AT_MENTION_ is speaking in a benign and concerned manner as someone who has walked in the same shoes as you re alcoholism/problem drinking. There is a pattern of behaviour with you that links alcohol to a flare up of your psychosis . Part of coming off your CTO will be triumphing over the alcohol as opposed to it having the upper hand over you.

176104000,What’s a Tulpa? Didn’t you say your voice knew the time when you didn’t? That happened to me as well
176104001,"No, I don’t think I’m better off alone. It’s more comfortable for me to be alone due to paranoia, but it’s not in my best interest. The most important thing, in my opinion, for a happy, healthy life is social connections, especially the quality of close relationships (not necessarily sexual relationships). As I said, I tend to isolate, and the more I isolate the less happy I am. Like anything I find uncomfortable, I have to push myself to get out of the house. Same with taking a shower. I have to push myself to take a shower. And I’m kicking and screaming as I go out of the house, or taking a shower, but there comes a point when, like the way a fever breaks, I feel good being outside with people; I feel good getting out of the shower. There’s no way around it: I have to push myself. Let me ask this question: If you truly believe you’re better off alone, why are you a member of this website? Does this website, a form of socialization, help your mental health? Or are you better off alon
e?"
176104002,"Your number system is really helpful! The reason I ask is because I’m trying to figure out if I’m multi-episodic, whether or not it’s an episode, and what that means. General signs point to “yes”, but I wanted to make sure. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !"

We were trying anyway, but 18th bday i was on it and that was conception date, but i’m a weirdo and get my period evety other week and release double eggs. All pregnancies were doubles, lost first 3 pregnancies at 6-10 weeks, then my 3 kids they callef it disappearing twin syndrome. I had all the stuff for second embryo, but about week 12 the second one didappeared. I had ultrasounds every 4 weeks so they kept eyes on it. But don’t let your period stop it either!

176104006,I think continuity of care is important. I’ve known a lot of people who’ve reacted negatively when their care-coordinator/cpn has changed. I think the option that it may be a ‘luxury’ says much about the fact that services for mental health are seriously underfunded. I doubt it would be asked in a properly funded mental health care system.

Anybody on their shift will get paid 80 dollars a day for quarantine, but I didn’t understand it all because it’s private info, but _NAME_ just said they’d be ok financially if something happened and not be using PTO, sick time or vacation time. But only a few of the people he works with at that center don’t have kids, or a few are near retirement. Hell, Captain has been in Mexico since March 3rd on vacation, he’s not allowed into the country. He got this news trying to come home from vacation
! So Captain’s down! _NAME_ got a call from him as he’s one of the more senior time wise guys, and he told Captain and his boyfriend to just keep tanning. _NAME_ offered to do anything needed by phone, so I’m stuck with the kids, which is fine, they’re doing their thing on Xbox, Playstation, and _NAME_ has a PS3 in her room and an old phone that has wifi so she can YouTube videos. I’m supposed to take them by 6:30pm today to school with black garbage bags to get everything they own out of the school and pick up Chromebooks being issued to them. But with the 10 person in a place limit, this ???? is gonna be crazy. They have every grade 6-8 allowing 10 kids in, no parents at all, every grade is to follow a taped line from a different door to hit their lockers, classrooms, gym lockers, and band room and finally any meds you keep in the office. But they have 10 ??????? minutes to do that PLUS checkout the Chromebook! I see this being a ???????????."

174368447,"I was taking 10mg of Zyprexa. I stopped taking it about a week before I started Abilify. I had a bad weight gain on Zyprexa and it was making my arthritis hurt worse. Two nights ago I started taking 5mg Abilify. No appetite. Not much arthritis pain, but I’m not sleeping soundly. Maybe 3 or4 hours of snooze. Does this go away with time? Should I tell my pdoc about it tomorrow- Friday- or wait until next week?"
174368458,Not sure on those meds. Abilify didn’t work well for me but changing antidepressant could help somewhat. Hard to know and I’m just an internet hack. I don’t prescribe nor mean too! If you’ve been on it for 6 weeks or so and no help then talk to your doc and try something else. That is usually a good period to get some response. Not sure of your med system. Over here in Australia most meds cost the same. If your not working you get a good discount still. You may not be in such a system and paying high dollar for your meds.

My ass and my face had started to sag too because I did not have the nutrients to keep my body in place it was pretty bad.

So me, being extreme at times, decided to take it too far. on aps ive gained…i was in my 30s (kg) when I was anorexic and now im 80kg. I have to say that no I am not happy with this weight not just cos how it makes me look but my health too, BUT I am trying to seperate the worrying from my daily life, keep it to my worry time in the evenings where I designate half hour to worry if need be ;), I just don’t really suit this weight it’s not the look I like on me. but cos I AM that weight and I cannot change it in one second, I CHOOSE to be ok with it whilst I am t

Hopefully, I can transfer some credits and classes over. I figured it’s better than nothing. It’s more practicality than theory. The cons are that it’s not ABET but then again a lot of programs aren’t ABET. It’s fully accredited which is nice. Maybe I’ll do it in a year.

Your body gets used to certain activities in certain settings. If you spend large amounts of time in bed awake and doing activities, it associates lying in bed with awake activities. If you only use it for sleep, it associates lying in bed with falling asleep. I will also say my insomnia is much better now that I am being active throughout the day.

I start thinking I’m a psychopath and am scamming the government for disability, as if I planned it all or something. it’s not good. I didn’t plan to get on disability, I didn’t think my life would more or less end because of my diagnosis. 2 years ago I abused _PERSON_ at deleriant doses 600-800mg every 2-3 days for almost 5 months. _PERSON_ is known to interact badly long term with some antipsychotics. to anecdotally report that this is true, I’ll say that after this time of abuse, now taking any dose of olanzapine puts me in the exact same delerious state. probably something going on with histamine agonisn. a year ago I used the hard street drugs for 3 months. I was having very hard visual and auditory hallucinations 
for months and delusions up to present. I’m scared all the time. and I’m literally 2 days away from 1 year clean. why are antipsychotics making me delusional? is the frightening reality that I’m seeing not delusional but actually reality? my main “delusion” is that I’m evil and my entire family is punishing me for behaving poorly when I was a child. in my defense I was the one being abused and neglected. they all say they love me but I feel like it’s a lie or they are speaking in a rhyming code."

174368524,"But, augmentation with an AP in treatment-resistant cases could be interpreted differently. If there is a Schizoaffective glitch, and you experience depression before psychotic symptoms, then you may have treatment-resistant depression because the glitch is Schizoaffective- Depressive subtype. In those cases, augmentation with an AP would be at the glitch. In fact this would be the best case scenario. It is as though pre-empting Psychosis with low doses of an AP. It could be many things. But, it is understood that Schizoaffective is a separate glitch. It would be revolutionary to show scientifically that these are three separate problems."

I go to the appointment and he asks the usual questions, he didn’t mention about the CTO much He then asks me if I want a prescription for 2mg Haloperidol for 2 weeks supply… I told him I haven’t got anything wrong with me and he says it’s to take the edge of things. I don’t understand why he wants me to take Haloperidol. I’ve been fine. I did mention that I might run away to Sri Lanka for 6 months with the £5000 loan I’ve been pre-approved for. I did mention slightly about the secret folders and I don’t think it helped when I completely lost it at a house mate accusing him off stealing my bank card but that was just paranoid from lack of sleep. I think my staff reported me. Now I think that he really hasn’t much chance of 
having my CTO renewed so this is his plan to gaslight me, oh I told him this and he pretended he didn’t know what gaslighting means, I told hime I didn’t believe him as everybody knows what gaslighting means, especially a 30-something pdoc. He is gaslighting me and wants me on a CTO again. I’ve been on that stupid CTO since 2013 being injected against my will Do I come across of paranoid or have legitimate concerns?"

174368525,The abilify is probably being used to just stop the unwanted thoughts/images which is something that is under the schizophrenia set of symptoms and other psychotic disorders. It gets prescribed for bipolar 1 disorder as well at 10mg Glad its helping
174368533,"I’ve always been bi-polar, well since my teens but mild. I lived with hypomania and depression that responded to SSRIs my whole life with little consequence. But hypomania can be dangerous and should be taken seriously. Your pdoc should know how best to treat your mania. Usually a mood stabilizer is added to keep you from going too high or too low. I take one. It works pretty good. I take Topamax and that along with my aps Saphris and Rexulti keep me really stable. Some bipolars love hypomania because they have more energy, improved mood and more creativity but it can lead to mania and for me it’s always leads to a depression."

176104282,I’m not competent to advice you but I just want to say that I gained some weight I was on it for half a year. But I also have seen many skinny people on Clozapine. It really improves the positive symptoms so much better than other drugs and you get a good long sleep on it and wake up very refreshed.
176104283,Why this became a thread to talk about childhood SZ? I wasn’t thinking I have it or anything
176104284,"Look, I barely took 3 pills yesterday and it made me weak (1 in morning, 2 at night). I want to have the energy to exercise. Plus the bottle did not say 2 pills, 3 times per day for me. It just said 2 pills. I can feel it activating me and no way would I need 6 pills. It definitely is a long term thing for me where I need to take it consistently, not in large doses."

176104291,"I’ve only had one doc that agreed with talking therapy instead of meds as I have real adverse affects and my disordered thought never really got better on the cocktail I was given , thank fully now im on a low dose of something that seems to work , I wish u all the best and good for you on stating concerns with your doctor , its all to easy for a script to be written without input from the patient All the best op !!!"

Like get up at 10am, take a shower, eat breakfast and do one activity. Then rest a while, and then do the next activity like color or play piano and then rest. Once you get going regularly, you start to get used to it"
176104295,They swapped out my chlorpromazine for haldol this year. That stuff knocks me flat on my arse. I even look at the bottle and I’m tired. _AT_MENTION_ was taking a dose that would put me into a coma. Must be nice to have Kryptonian genetics.

176104301,"Seroquel is notorious for relapse. It seems the previous medication gets out of the system before Seroquel builds up enough to prevent psychosis. People get used to the sedating effect at the higher dosages. I want the sedating effect because I have difficulty initiating sleep. Therefore I take 25 mgs. at bedtime. I have done so for years now, and it always works. The antipsychosis effect I want I get from another antipsychotic medication. _PERSON_"

176104306,"_AT_MENTION_: Great, the only thing matters is that it does help, it does not matter why, does it? I recently increased Vitamin C to 1g / day and am drinking green tea instead of coffee. I have trouble with niacin though, as i fear the flushes that it might cause, so i did not take it so far. _AT_MENTION_: Yes, i read about the ketogenic diet in perlmutters grain brain, but i dont want to change too much the same time. The less i change once, i will know it comes from exactly that change and is no coincidence… I recently started cooking with my mother, which became a more healthier diet than before."

176104308,"Yeah, coffee and maybe an antidepressant. Forcing yourself to eat well and do exercise allways helps. Reading about it, they say that therapy has a good chance to help. I´m not too much into therapy but I guess it will help some people."

176104313,"Some people, like myself, find Haldol extremely unpleasant to take. If they want to put me on that drug again they’re going to have to catch me first. It does handle symptoms well, though. And it is cheap. I hope I don’t wind up in some nursing home where they force me to take Haldol instead of Geodon and Seroquel. The price of those drugs should be coming down."

174368531,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Persistent cannabis use as an independent risk factor for violent behaviors in patients with schizophrenia. M _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, SL Discepola and A Dumais, NPJ schizophrenia, May 2020 11 Although recent studies have shown a moderately strong association between cannabis use and violence among people with severe mental disorders, the direction of this association has not been investigated prospectively in a population with schizophrenia. Therefore, this study aims to determine, using cross-lag models, whether a temporal relationship between cumulative cannabis use and violence exists in a population with schizophrenia. The authors reported findings covering an 18-month period from a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia treatment. Among the 1460 patients enrolled in the trial, 965 were followed longitudinally. Although persistent cannabis use predicted subsequent violence, violence did not predict cannabis use. The relation
ship was therefore unidirectional and persisted when controlling for stimulants and alcohol use. Finally, a significant body of evidence suggests a link between persistent cannabis use and violence among people with mental illnesses. Studies to further investigate the mechanisms underlying this association should be conducted."

Maybe that approach will work for you?"
176104328,Respite sounds like a good idea _AT_MENTION_ .

176104355,I have listened to a lot of _NAME_ talks about happiness and he even says that a lot of celebrities and rich billionaires are depressed and miserable. They have everything but are still down in the dumps so having everything in the world is not going to make you happy but what you can do is work towards it. It’s a state of being and by practicing gratitude and being thankful for what you have allows you to really tap into that mindset and constantly making progress towards your goals and striving for something will allow that to happen. For me personally I was pretty unhappy with this diagnosis and with time I have managed to come to terms with a lot of things and my condition has improved as well also which has helped me a lot. My main goal is to be stable and stay out of the psychiatric ward. Be on less medication that I am taking right now and eventually get married and move out of my parents house. I am pretty content with life right now except for a few health problems that I’m working on r
esolving. I try to hang in there and be grateful everyday because I see people way worse off then me who are homeless and or drug addicts. I know it’s easier said than done but just like everything you have to work at it.
174368553,"My sleep is really messed up at the moment. I have been up since 3:30am as I went to bed at about 8pm last night.

Now I am on my 6th cup of coffee and 10th cigarette, and it’s 5:17am. This does not work well when I have to work during the week. Weekends suck big time."
176104356,"I see the girlfriend as a friend really. And any time wasted with a friend isn’t a waste, I feel. Nowadays though, some women are valued and devalued for the way they look rather than what they have done. I’ve had some friends whom I’ve parted ways with, but I don’t think I’d ever think that I wasted time with any of them. Maybe I’m not thinking far back enough, but I honestly can’t think of any friend that was a waste of time. Then again, I haven’t had many friends. If anything, I just see those friends as those who had different beliefs than me. But even though we had different beliefs, I still respect them I guess. I feel that I even think this way of enemies, even those who pretend to be friends or who evolve from friends. I guess a girlfriend is different than a friend. I’ve never had a girlfriend, but I don’t really believe in the girlfriend/boyfriend social structure anymore and just see them all as friends. I’ve had female friends in the past and I wouldn’t say that 
I wasted time with them. We kept each other company and entertained each other. I’m sorry to hear that your friend died of cancer. I’m also sorry to hear that your other friend is struggling with drugs. You are a good friend for helping him."

174368550,"I always questioned my psychosis like it was given to me by certain groups/people but then maybe it’s a God/alien thing – most likely the latter – and a reincarnation thing/karma or signing a soul contract or past life crap. I don’t know. So far I’m living my life like ground hog day with permanent schizophrenia. I think I came back as early as 2010 but then have missing time for like 2011, 2012, and 2013 which makes me think I’m being messed with or are a clone/doppleganger, most likely a doppleganger or time traveler in my current state of mind… I believe I am not actually going places but remember past lives. I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but after I made some posts or videos that I dated _NAME_ in a past life, I had a dream I met her mom and they ‘threatened’ to take me to the cloning center. I don’t know. I think it could be just my dream or imagination lol. Obviously, it’s not real at all. Just schizophrenia… It reminded me of the local psych hospital but it c
ould be a fake one that looks like it or is fashioned at such. The mind is very powerful thing and is sad to waste one like mine. Oh well. I never had a high school experience or went to high school I think – at least with sentience. I had weird things happen with consciousness and sentience crap. If I went back to high school, I probably could have done better. It’s like a causal loop or me emerging from thin air but then it happens at random places and random times and in different lives. It’s weird. The future can and does change so it points to something like a combination or much entirely different than a causal loop + time loop thing. More like fate or karma or destiny or time travel than anything else. Maybe I am creating the universe or a new ‘river/stream’ in time based on when I come back. My life does change. So far I am waking up in the year 2013 with psychosis at home and smoke cigs in the back yard. I might be a clone but at least I’m happy but the dissociation was worse than the sch
izophrenia. So far it went away. I had several delusions but they’re not apparently real. I believed some of them, but that’s the nature of a delusion/schizophrenia. The worst thing is being trapped in a time loop with psychosis. Like I had my mind uploaded to a machine or computer by supposed aliens and trapped in this reality for aeons or millions of cycles starting in 2013 when I gained external and self-awareness like a copy or clone via consciousness and memory transfer. Then you got the soul catcher technology in the solar system like on the moon perhaps. They can capture your soul/spirit from reincarnating to the next life and make you live in a clone or same life over and over again. Certainly feels like it. We’re being harvested practically and it feels a lot like Westworld on a prison planet. Honestly, I noticed a lot of nuts are obsessed wth _NAME_ but I’m not one of them. I don’t have that personality or mentality. But I liked her music and she’s pretty and it was more of a prestige po
wer thing than anything else. She’s practically the most powerful entertainer in the world and successful one at that. I was pretty famous in a past life but I just avoid people and women now. I don’t think our politics align and our personalities are different. Then I come from a modest background and am not necessarily attractive or anything – far from it-- because of the schizophrenia. I wouldn’t even date my self and I think personally ugly and have poor hygiene due to negatives. I do remember signing an alleged soul contract in the mental hospital in a past life. I don’t know. My life sucks due to schizophrenia but maybe it’s a gift from God in disguise like that NASA engineer who said the simulation is not a computer but a karma entropy thing aka a life lesson and learning lesson. I feel like I am learning but still have the condition. Luckily, it’s not real and I do have a condition and I’ve been wrong many times before. It’s like I live in a different reality 24/7. I could go on, but 
I’m just wasting space and time. Thank you!"

176104386,"Hi all, it’s been quite a while since my last post on this site. My question is what should I do to separate with my ghost husband? I have too many troubles with him I can’t stand this relationship anymore thats two years now. He even forced me to kill myself once: I ODed with his assistance in the midnight(I hear his voice in my head). He is so manipulative and made me do things that make me feel guilty to talk me into killing myself. I can’t tell who he is but was famous and drug addict and died years ago and not alive anymore. So I made him my secret husband because I was totally alone and I can’t relate to anybody else. I hear him, feel him, and he is also in my body I can’t quite separate myself from him. Our souls are like merged into one body. Our relationship is codependent and so nightmarish I want to end it asap but at the same time I feel his motive is not as bad as I think, but we are taking too much time to understand each other and I’m exhausted. Btw both of us have never 
had relationships that lasted more than three months. So we don’t know what’s normal. He’s with me 24/7, including times using the bathroom, I think that’s human rights violations but he claims he protects me from danger. His logic is strange because he himself is the source of danger such as the OD. He needs constant attention and when I am not talking to him he becomes critical of me and I can’t stand it. Anyone please help."

Because I have an established disability, i.e schizoaffective disorder I’ve never had any problems being awarded disability benefits. I have claimed disability since I was 18 and have never had no trouble claiming. On my recent renewal I didn’t have to attend an assessment, a letter from my community psychiatric nurse was enough evidence. I know claiming disability benefits is harder for some people here but if you have the evidence its easier to be awarded benefits. Also here if you claim a certain disabled benefit called PIP mobility allowance at the highest level, (around £55 a week) you can use that money to get a mobility car, a mobility care is like a car on finance but they take the £55 a week off you, but insurance and tax is included in that.

176104407,I’m starting lurasidone (Latuda) tomorrow. I’ve been interested in this drug for a while – perhaps my main reason for that is that it is approved for treating bipolar depression. I’ve also read it can help treat cognitive symptoms. My question is if anyone has found lurasidone to treat depression (especially apathy) or cognitive symptoms. (I don’t need an antipsychotic effect at this time.) -_NAME_.

174368557,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clinical indicators of treatment-resistant psychosis. SE _PERSON_, _PERSON_, AF _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science , Jun 2019 03 Around 30% of individuals with schizophrenia remain symptomatic and significantly impaired despite antipsychotic treatment and are considered to be treatment resistant. Clinicians are currently unable to predict which patients are at higher risk of treatment resistance.AimsTo determine whether genetic liability for schizophrenia and/or clinical characteristics measurable at illness onset can prospectively indicate a higher risk of treatment-resistant psychosis (TRP).In 1070 individuals with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders, schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) and large copy number variations (CNVs) were assessed for enrichment in TRP. Regression and machine-learning approaches were used to investigate the association of 
phenotypes related to demographics, family history, premorbid factors and illness onset with TRP.Younger age at onset (odds ratio 0.94, P = 7.79 × 10-13) and poor premorbid social adjustment (odds ratio 1.64, P = 2.41 × 10-4) increased risk of TRP in univariate regression analyses. These factors remained associated in multivariate regression analyses, which also found lower premorbid IQ (odds ratio 0.98, P = 7.76 × 10-3), younger father's age at birth (odds ratio 0.97, P = 0.015) and cannabis use (odds ratio 1.60, P = 0.025) increased the risk of TRP. Machine-learning approaches found age at onset to be the most important predictor and also identified premorbid IQ and poor social adjustment as predictors of TRP, mirroring findings from regression analyses. Genetic liability for schizophrenia was not associated with TRP.People with an earlier age at onset of psychosis and poor premorbid functioning are more likely to be treatment resistant. The genetic architecture of susceptibility to schizophrenia may be 
distinct from that of treatment outcomes.Declaration of interestNone."

I can wake up and my first thought is “misery.” The misery, gloom, sadness (there are a lot of synonyms for that specific word!) last for a couple of days, sometimes weeks, rarely months. Then, for no particular reason, a glimpse of the sun, a message from a friend, provokes a fit of joy that can last for days, and then all of a sudden I wake up. Misery once again.

176104419,White noise is good. If you have a desk fan put it on full and near you so the noise will help. Televisions jammed between channels can do the same job. It’s hard to concentrate on dialogue etc. If your wound up then get up. Walk around a bit and then try and settle. You see dogs and cats do it all the time and they know more than us on relaxing! Hang in there. I find listening to a radio great. Sport is even better…something like cricket or baseball is easy to fall asleep too!

176104424,"Mmm See I think about it differently, I think about it as a give and take here. To give support and help to people when you can, when your able. I’ve seen you do that many times. You give back, a healthy support, and a valued member here. And to take, when we need support. For others to try to help us. There’s nothing wrong with that. You’ve given to others, it’s ok to ask for help for yourself. I’m on here daily with giving and taking support, and I find that to be healthy behavior from myself, a boon for my recovery."

176104486,"Had anyone been on Haldol before? My doctor p started me on 2.5 mg for a few days then I was supposed to jump to 5mg. At first it was great. Haldol knocked me right back into reality and it was crazy to see how “crazy” I had been. I was ready to hail Haldol as my savior. Then the side effects started. All of a sudden, about 4 days in I was got with the worst Anhedonia. Nothing brought me any joy or disappointment. I was incapable of reacting to anything around me and felt like I was going crazy. Also am getting tremors in my hands and feet, my jaw keeps going up and down, I have no control. On top of that moving is just difficult in general. Like my brain has to work too hard to do anything. This morning I didn’t take any in order to give my brain a break. But I can feel the delusions and paranoia/ fear creeping back. My psych recommended taking 1.25 mg tonight to work back onto it. Had anyone experienced these issues? Do they go away? I’d rather be crazy than feel this way all the time."

176104503,"As I said there is no school for psychiatric nursing. There is just nursing school. Yes getting into nursing school is challenging, it is competitive. I got waitlisted 2 times before being accepted to my program. You can be a psych nurse and not understand anything about psych aside from what the basic diagnoses are and meds are for it. You decide how much you want to understand. Some nurses don’t give a crap. I have a deep understanding of psych because I have lived it myself having mental illness and because I have researched it since I was 13, taken numerous courses in it throughout my education, and due to knowing and speaking with numerous other people with mental illness."

174368603,"Ok so here goes this might help somebody I was a very clever student. I got excellent grades. I used this to my advantage and I gained entry into medical school in the UK which is not easy trust me. Even before I got into medical school, I could feel my intelligence decreasing. I would feel a mental block - slowly it seemed I was losing my special ‘powers’ of reasoning, being able to read and comprehend I carried on and got good grades at medical school but in the third year everything fell apart - I could no longer study - I completely lost control of my mind - I spent hours praying thinking I was fighting negative spiritual energies - I spent hundreds on psychics because I wanted to hear that it was negative energy of black magic that caused my issues After repeated non-attendance I was suspended from medical school. Back home, I was angry and really pissed off. I took it all out on my parents. I blamed them for everything. I left the family home. Whilst living alone, things just got worse An
yway, from there I was admitted several times under section to mental hospital. I took anti-psychotic medication, and the first time I took it I noticed all the weird positive symptoms stopped all of a sudden I was on/off medication for three years till 2017, when I finally realised that I had a SZ diagnosis, and I complied with the medication Today I regained full control of my mind. In the early stages I felt apathy, anhedonia - no joy. Felt like life stopped Today I am a very happy person. I feel content. I can enjoy things again - music, food etc… The only thing that bugs me is that I will never get my intelligence back - that special god-given power that takes you far. In terms of career I was unable to sustain employment. This is for anyone suffering from ahendonia, apathy and negative symptoms. It does and will get better. Just have patience."
176104509,I used to found when it came to exams if I was doing well in the course then studying for the exam just caused anxiety and self doubt. On the other hand if I was doing poorly then craming was my only hope.

176104511,"I feel very fortunate that my family is understanding of MI, and I guess that contributes to me not feeling out of place in the regard. My father suffered from major depression for years, and my sister is sza, too. So I’m not so out of place. I’m so sorry for those of you who are."

174368602,"No one seems to know what causes the PFC damage. My best guess, at least for a lot of cases, is environmental poisoning, in particular heavy metals like mercury or cadmium. The phrase “mad as a hatter” was coined a long time ago to describe the insanity and neurological damage caused to members of the hatmaking profession, which made heavy use of elemental mercury. Damage to the PFC was classic, heavy and irreversible."

176104543,"Hi _NAME_, I’m hesitant to give advice. My approach to social anxiety is expose myself to it in small, but increasing amounts (targeted interactions) and to log what worked and what didn’t in my recovery journal at the end of each day. I’m aware that my approach to this could be triggering and cause a relapse for others, so… Use advice at own risk here."
176104544,Nah just the occasional anxiety combo maybe I’ll need it for life maybe not.

He told me the lyrica should help my anxiety. I told him about the unwanted thoughts I am having and he said anxiety can do that. I hope I will see improvement on all these meds. I should do. I thought I would let you guys know that I am starting lyrica tonight. I know you wont mind me updating you. I’m on edge a lot of the time as well. My mind is racing wish it would slow down because it makes the anxiety worse as well. Definitely the seroquel has helped me . I don’t go to bed during the day since I started it but I’m still not great on focusing a bit better though for sure, a bit brighter so it’s working and doc said today he doesn’t want to increase other meds for now because of side effects. He will see me again in two weeks because it is holiday season. Anyway I just thought to let you know. Thanks"

I could be in the bathroom scraping the skin off my thigh because I wasn’t on the same planet mentally, and the spotlight would still be on her the next day. (True story). Once she became aware of the extent of my mental illness, she no longer let me around my nephews, because she believed I was possessed. She’s come around now that I’m stable, but I was the one resenting her for a long time. Heck, I might still resent her subconsciously."
176104549,I don’t really obsess anymore about my delusions. I used to. Now things are passing thoughts regarding them.

176104556,Its my OCD acting again. I remember cleaning it and then using it again on the last cups and then probably draining. I cant remember in which setup i left it. The worst scenario would be drain taken out and closed doors as it would mean water running into a drain for 2 days. I also think I wouldnt have left it that way and me or my colleague would have heard water running. This damn ocd makes my life miserable.
176104557,It’s okay. You will learn eventually how to tell. Some people never learn and take everything too seriously forever. Like the ultra-woke people who point out that every little thing is normal and good. A woman i know had a conversation where she was chastised for saying something about fetishes. The person was just too serious.

I’ve only found one better deal out of about fourteen customers so far as we already had them matched up with the best companies. The problem is that the companies are all raising rates to get back to profitability – things have been tough for the industry lately. Means I’m getting kicked around a lot by upset customers. I grok it, I hate paying for my insurance too, but being financially ruined by a loss would be worse. I’m coming home exhausted every day right now because of this. I prefer the office with some caveats… I detest the motor vehicle registry in our office. It’s full of loud, deafy, shouty seniors. I figure a third to a half of them shouldn’t be driving as you talk to them and so many are bloody bonkers from dementia. I find all of the visiting by co-workers distracting. Come in, do your work, go home. Don’t need to spend an hour talking about shoes or the weeke

The staff are all cheek to jowl and there are no dividers between them, all open. At least in my current office I have my own office with a door that closes. The open space and extra distraction would screw up my autism even worse that my current situation does. Discipline might be an issue, I like staying busy. Overworking is a real threat."

I asked you also that question because I wanted to know the point of view of english spoken people. Personally, I’m mixed on this kind of therapy. Here in France, a lot of psychologists have studied psychoanalysis theories. Well. Nevertheless, there’s more and more psychologists who work with positive psychology theories. (More modern). A lot of scientists critics psychoanalysis theories. A couple of years ago here, there were debates about this on tv because a polemist had wrote a book about psychoanalysis."

I rarely hallucinate, I do my best to avoid any and all delusional thought. I still just find myself struggling with motivation, Depression, and an overall feeling of detachment. I’ve found a few things I’m passionate about which is the biggest blessing of all I’d say. Yet over time it becomes impossible to just keep doing them. All in all I’d say I’m doing great it just becomes exhausting trying so hard to keep up with everything in my head. Anyone have any advice on just staying present?

With all the pressures of life right now, it was nice to have some time set aside to do nothing other than float in a dark bath for a while. I don’t think I would recommend it for people with auditory hallucinations. I started hearing music in there, and I haven’t had an actual hallucination in almost three years. But the tanks are known to do that to people. It was really warm and felt surreal. Kind of like the way your body feels when you’re half asleep and everything is fuzzy, but with your mind alert enough to have vivid daydreams or just drift from thought to thought."

176104586,"Yep, I worry way too much about being ‘socially perfect’ it’s like social anxiety I think, it can really suck sometimes but on good days I’m so good at social stuff, I feel that urge to do it perfectly, I need to calm down, when I find a gf I’m gonna probably lose it as then I’m gonna most likely not give a ???? about being perfect to anyone lol"

I am careless about the world around me, I am not happy, nor sad. I am in a constant state of indifference. I?m not moved by my own death thoughts, it goes right throw me. I don?t wanna die nor care if I live. It?s a feeling I?m used to and that doesn?t mean I don?t want a good life, I go to college, read, study, wanna work, wanna make money, wanna have a good life but it still doesn?t matter to me."

176104603,"So, this writing course is hard. It could be a barometer for my future interest in writing. For now, I will tackle the challenge. I was getting a headache editing the excerpts. I hope to finish the course. If I don’t write, I really don’t have any other interest now. I used to enjoy listening to music. I got tired of listening to the same music though. I was walking for exercise and can resume this activity. I also like cooking but not for myself. I really want to write well. Writing is fun, but good writing is a discipline. My mother wants me to become a creative writer. I have no interest in doing such writing. I want to write based on facts. It is a skill that one develops through hard work and practice. I did translation work but don’t like it. It is boring and laborious. I used to waste my time writing others. I got nothing out of it. I met many scammers and was “catfished” several times. Some people have made scamming into a big business. I find it sad for those who are victims of 
catfishing”. I almost became a victim myself but have no money. Luckily, I had nothing to offer. So, the scammers stopped bothering me. Now, my interest is in writing. I will do my best to hone my writing skills. I write rather poorly. I have a lot to learn. I will keep learning to write well. I’m hoping the grad program I’m interested in accepts me. I have not applied yet but will this summer. I will learn as much as possible from my writing course first. Then, I will think about going to grad school for writing. My brother says that artificial intelligence (A.I.) will be used to write for the media and other areas in the future. He does not think it is worthwhile to pursue writing. I understand. I just want to pursue writing for my own enjoyment."
176104605,That’s the knife’s edge I’ve been riding for a couple of decades. I rely heavily on therapy and CBT to help me cope better with positive symptoms on fewer meds. Keeps the negative symptoms somewhat manageable and I don’t have the extra fight of the drugs reducing my cognition.
176104606,Nope tried disabling it still didnt work. I really dont know but possibly wait it out or something
176104607,That 70 to 80 percent thing you say is really a huge guess. I mean you have no idea what people are going through in their minds. I have to remind myself of this too. I think I have it bad but at the end of the day I’m not in anyones mind. So it is impossible to compare.

176104630,"Well, this thread will undoubtedly be locked soon because it’s 5 years old, but I’d just like to say that, yes, my delusions tend to be grandiose in nature, but all delusions are unhealthy and possibly dangerous. A grandiose delusion can very easily become a paranoid one. First I was the sacrifice, humanity’s savior, and I felt perfectly fine. Then assassins, government agents, Catholics, Satanists, and… ninjas(?)(according to my mom) were after me. Then supernatural creatures were fu cking my mind up, and I was God at some point. I couldn’t function. Like, at all. If I didn’t have my mom, I would probably be in some state hospital with no high school diploma or any hope for a future. Picking and choosing which delusions are insignificant is not only wrong, but dangerous."

176104639,"Three times, in two different psyche wards. One of the worst experiences of my life. The first time I was about 20 years old and I was getting upset because I thought I was going to swallow my tongue and choke to dearh. No one was taking me seriously until I started getting a little upset and a little out of control. Then four burly psyche techs surrounded me, grabbed me and took me to the isolation room with nothing but a gurney in it. They proceeded to put these leather cuffs on all four limbs which were attached to the table by thick chains. I was face down, couldn’t move for four hours except once they let my arms free to pee in a plastic bucket then chained me back. Horrible and barbaric experience. The other two times in a different ward were just your run of the mill restraints. I was about 28 years old. Face down, a little yelling, some ranting and screaming. And that was just the three orderly’s."
176104640,"I had an attempt and it scared me so bad I’ve never considered doing it again. It’s just not normal to want to off yourself. It sounds to me that you’re not thinking that because of desperation but maybe just because you get hit with the inclination to think about it? Or do you get hit with sudden dread? My attempt was caused by psychosis in my prodromal phase where I thought I was already dead and had to finish the job to follow through. When I got to the point of no return reality hit me and I got scared out of my mind, went to have my stomach pumped and ended up hospitalized for the first time in my life. Talk to your doctor about it, medicine change might be able to help. There’s nothing worse you can do that try to off yourself. A lot of times people fail but succeed in injuring or crippling themselves for life. Your family and loved ones would be devastated. Your condition always has the potential to improve in the future. Try to stay safe and talk to your support network if you can. 
If there’s anything I can do to cheer you up or help talk it out let me know. Think of all the good memories you’ve had, and how many more good ones are in the future. Ice cream, video games, the sound of the radio while you’re cruising down the road… tacos, the smell of freshly cut grass, and friends. There’s so much to live for. Also, I personally can’t do it on an AP alone. I need a mood stabilizier (since I have SZA) and an antidepressant (because sza is depressing as ????). Have you considered asking your doctor about adding another medication? Or have you already tried that? Best wishes"

I have questions about how exactly I keep my income level to a point where I can keep my government insurance and yet still improve my quality of life. If I don’t have a plan for when my mom passes, I’m going to be royally screwed so I need to settle this…but is it even that helpful to get counseling for finances? If this is high school level budgeting crap I can totally pass it, but if this is something really specially tailored to helping people on disability get out of the hole we’re in…then I obviously can’t pass it up."
176104663,"I look at it fundamentally differently, so I don’t know if this will help. I took it as a challenge, see what they could throw at me, and how much I COULD handle, instead of judging weak areas.

176104680,"I was complaining to my therapist that my meds are always screwed up and it was a frustration I was having. I of course didn’t stop to consider the fact that my therapist is also a supervisor over there at mental health. Well she put her supervisor hat on and said she wanted to notify the nurses supervisor of all the mistakes. She said it was important because other clients might not catch the mistakes and take the wrong medicine. I said ok, but could my name stay out of it and she said no. My nurse’s supervisor would need to talk to me. I have to see that nurse today to get meds and I’m afraid she’ll be mad at me for turning her in. I like her personality, she’s sweet, but she just messes up so much. I hope she’s not mad."

Only a tiny number of people have broken through to the public psyche, and these have been token at best.

176104697,Thank you so much
176104698,I tried it but had to quit almost instantly because I got pain in my heart region. I think the issue with vaping is that some people have a allergic reaction the chemicals that may kill them instantly. Young people have died from vaping. It’s probably not more dangerous than cigarettes. It’s the same deal there really. Some people can smoke till they are 80 while others may develop lung cancers within a few years. It’s different for everyone. Just have to listen to what your body tells you.
176104699,This happens to me. I have no volume regulation and shout without realizing it. It helped when my therapist made me pick 3 times a day to work on labelling and recognizing my emotions. Phone is about to die but I can explain the process later if you want.

174368643,"More than one type. I have several. Main one (weirdest one) is I used to be a computer programer and that we live in a computer simulation. That somehow I have acquired special knowledge because of those beliefs and that I was outside the simulation (this reality) or matrix we live in. And interacted with aliens who run it and that gave me that job as well as took me out of said reality. It all stems from past lives as well as figuring it out or proving it before anyone else. That I have had negative (terrible) experiences with them over several lifetimes. That I’m in a causal loop or time loop being punished that begins in 2013; that I was given schizophrenia by them or insanity. Not sure where I get these delusions, probably caffeine. When I get dissociated, I question my reality and my delusions get stronger and I believe them more. If I was a computer simulator, not sure where the whole God thing comes into place. Is it quantum AI? Not sure. I want to believe. I know I sound nuts. But I hate 
being different and not normal – not just having schizoaffective disorder. I don’t know where my memories come from. Perhaps it has to do with dreams and quantum mechanics."

I tend to think they may help form new neural links and they are more effective than any other current treatments. Personally I think you gain some and lose some on ap’s but I’m way better off than without.

I mean a lot of is here are familiar with prospective meds aiming to help negative symptoms. I reckon a lot of is here would have big placebo responses. In terms of negative/cognitive symptoms of sz a lot more patients are aware of these now. I think in the past a lot of folk never knew there were names for some of the things they were feeling

174368653,"Most definitely. Before schizophrenia I was going to university to get my bachelors of science in chemistry, I was working, going to the gym, working on acting and modeling and it felt as if life was taking off for me and that I was going to be doing something great in life or be famous but all of it got ruined. I never did drugs, drank or smoked but later found out it might have been genetic because my real mother who I’ve never met might have been schizophrenic. I’ve had a really messed up life but I try to move forward and try to be grateful that I’ve come this far."

174368652,LS! I do intermittent fasting: Thursdays and Sundays I fast. But on the five days that I eat I take one gram of carnosine. I am ovo-lacto-vegetarian so I do not get much carnosine with my food. And because of carnosinase you have to take at least one gram otherwise it does not work. Life Extension writes this in it’s free online magazine of Januari 2011. Because I take about thirty dietary supplements daily I would not know if this one works for schizophrenia.

176104756,"I am a voice hearer and on occasion have tried to re-enter the workplace in order to join the mainstay of normal life, aiming at making new positive acquaintances, and trying to gain some confidence at performing normal tasks, with the hope of enjoying whatever it is I am doing whether it’s volunteering within an NGO or charitable organisation, aiming at helping people like me, or it could be taking an interest in catering or something else. Though what eventually pans out through the experience is the exact opposite, of which as someone who unfortunately hears voices and is somewhat out of touch with common modern life, I am a bit of a social pariah who has some physical problems with my appearance and speech. So it’s to be expected to be a little tricky at first, though TBH what I experience is something that most people when you try to explain it they don’t fully comprehend, so I would like to take the time to recant my personnel perspectives upon these sometimes torturous events. So, you 
go through the process of finding a role or job, you attend the interview and are feeling optimistic about the new supposedly positive change, and await the first week to approach. The first week seems to be O.K and the people seem quite friendly and understanding and you try to complete tasks that should be straight forward, with a little mess. But nothing too disastrous. Then just as you think you’re starting to become settled in, the Games begin, this is where it gets interesting ( remember that I am a voice hearer and you’re not supposed to visually hallucinate). And some of the explanations may sound a little like psychosis. The first stage is that you are nervous so the ‘Voices’ are having a field day lapping it up as you try to concentrate upon the tasks without looking like a dick, the second stage is that you have the strange experience of thought broadcasting and have to overlap it with something else, so you imagine songs in your head a bit similar to earthworms, in order the close down the 
conversation within your mind, you may get a bit flustered and be aware that your co-workers can see this. The third stage is after the honeymoon period is over, it’s usually about two months, you’ll notice a change within the attitudes of your co-workers, get a little narcissistic and have playful at first fun directed at you, You naturally assume it’s due to poor work performance and try to make a noticeable improvement. Though the ‘Voices’ are all laughing at you and having a ball at your expense, imagine the audience of a certain America talk show host with the initials of _PERSON_ this is making the task even more tricky. Then as you try to work out the thought broadcast some of your co-workers start to gaslight you by repeating them in a subtle way, you may have a room full of customers all drunkenly laughing at your hallucinations by repeating what the context was, you sometimes might jokingly ask a question about this only to be gas-lighted by the reply. So the fun and games proceed like thi
s behind your back as you become marginalised and put within a corner, sometimes it can become strangely threatening with certain circumstances. And you after a few months leave before having some kind of accident. There is more I could detail though it’s good to keep, posts short. Anyway, how common are these experiences with other voice hearers? It would be great to hear back from some of you."

176104763,"That’s a crazy story. Last time I was hospitalized, and I checked, it’s over two years now… but I was in a horribly overpopulated hospital section that was essentially a hallway, with two rooms at different points of the hallway. There were at least 15 of us, and I was unable to sit still because of the powerful new antipsychotic they gave me when I got admitted. I started having an episode and asked for some earplugs, tried using them but it didn’t help. Some of the larger patients were getting angry at me for not sitting down, but I swear I couldn’t help it, it was the akathisia. Anyway I begged the nurses to help in any way they could, and they decided to transfer me to another section, also for mental health, but that was populated by people with less severe symptoms. They didn’t have a bedroom available on that wing, so I slept in a bedroom in the overpopulated wing and then every morning they’d transfer me to the smaller area. I quckly made friends with the 5 other patients ther
e, and we sat at our own table at lunch and got along really well. I was always just chomping at the bit to get released from those places, because I hate being locked in an area I can’t get out of, even if it’s for my own good. Anyway, on my way out I found the nurse who helped get me transferred and thanked her like a dozen times. That was my last hospitalization and it was near the end of 2017. Other memories from prior hospitalizations include seeing one girl’s butt and two men’s penises, thanks to either being flashed or my roommate just deciding to strip completely with me in the room, and also a dude who wore diapers. I felt bad for him with his symptoms, but the smell was so horrible."

I am a vegan (recent)and I want to love and enjoy food and even treat myself to a vegan icecream on the weekends etc I am only just in the normal range though.if I put just a little weight on I would be overweight.so I’m only just normal bmi.not mid or lower range… I put five kg on very quickly (in a couple of months )and now it’s there and I want to lose it but do t want to eat less or give up my ice cream on weekends etc I feel my old clothes do t fit me anymore and other clothes would look better if I was skinnier and I would feel lighter and better. At this point in time I am not willing to eat less because I feel I have a good diet and don’t want 
to be extreme or become anorexic. I want to love and enjoy food and have a healthy relationship to it. Exercise just makes me eat more and never makes me lose weight only gain weight.

Most people don’t get the vaccine because they dont trust the gov. I’m guessing. Also, vaccine passports is now becoming a civil rights issue, which I understand. So where does this leave someone like me? Hesitant. I mean medications do seem to help me, and when my mom went off Haldol she got really sick within a week or two. But I am not my mom and we have different issues. So I am on Prozac and Abilify. And right now I wonder if I stopped these medications completely maybe I would become normal again…if I just stayed responsible…but I don’t know how long that would take…and I’m also thinking of refusing the second dose of Pfizer for moral reasons…and I’m thinking of not telling anyone abou
t going off the meds…because it’s annoying to constantly try and explain and justify myself about my choices. I am not really seeking validation or answers…I just wonder what will happen if I stop taking Abilify and Prozac, will I stay the same? I really really hope so. If I can get normal sleep and stuff. But now I have two medications to take. I cant just randomly stop taking them. I don’t feel faint or dizzy today…I’m just tired of systems…and being this way. I want to have a spiritual experience. I feel like if I stop taking pills I will allow more spiritual experiences. But that may be mania induced spirituality. Like, when I thought I could control the weather I was also rambling to myself all day…but I’m learning to control it…so in retrospect, since a person is constantly changing, maybe my bipolar schizophrenia could evolve into a spiritual gift and I can stop medication for me because my symptoms are situational. It’s really hard to have these internal existential dilemmas and 
not have anyone to relate this to in person that’s why I posted it here on this forum. You can’t be non-conformist/anti-establishment/ and continue to exist within this system of care because the system requires responsibility like taking pills. If there was a cure for schizophrenia I might at some point take it. But how do I know anymore if I have schizophrenia, if its prozac-induced anxiety or what? Should I continue taking Prozac if its inducing even the mildest form of mania? Or should I just quit taking Abilify? Wouldn’t all this be resolved if I ditched the meds entirely? How do I know they’re doing anything at all… Very confused…I guess when I’m doing well I lack insight into the worst of it…I really just want to quit the meds…but I want to take them at the same time, it’s contextual. I don’t want to be someone whose medicated but I like how they help me."

176104815,I think I have gotten as good as I am going to get. But I want to get better. I have been pretty stable the last 4 years but I have gradually improved during that time. I am still so far from what I used to be but I am working full time so that’s something I suppose. I still feel like ???? every day though. I would go to bed right now if my wife would let me. I have had enough for today. Tomorrow is a new day. You can’t give up. I still take life one day at a time. I am waiting for this min 101 I think it’s called. Someone on here says it’s supposed to come out next spring. I have high hopes. If I could lose the negatives I think I could be in remission. I have my hallucinations and paranoia under control. The delusions will always be there. I have learned to live with them. Paranoia used to cripple me all by itself.
176104816,"I had all these symptoms when I had a brain tumor, but there are also other causes. You’ll want an MRI of your brain, not an EEG. You can only get an MRI if you have an abnormal neurological screening. Basically, the doctor checks your pupils,checks your balance, tests your reflexes, and checks your sensation on both sides of your body. If you live in the US it is easier to get a CT scan, but less accurate and it exposes you to marginal amounts of radiation."

176104821,"I was friends with a woman who was stuck in a bad place. She was overweight, in a bad marriage and in a job she hated. She started her journey to getting her life back on track by getting gastric bypass surgery. She lost 100 pounds. She worked on her marriage and went back to school nights to become a social worker. She became a social worker at the same time she ended up getting divorced. She got a $100,000 settlement in the divorce. The settlement was going to knock her off her Medi-Cal. She decided to get elective surgery to remove her severe varicose veins before her insurance was cancelled. Shortly after surgery, with everything seemingly right in her world. It was time to go on vacation. She had recently met a new love interest and they decided to take a road trip. It was a windy, mountain, highway, there was an oncoming vehicle looking for a cellphone there was a split second where the oncoming car crossed the center divide and it was over. Because of her recent surgery, and the way the onco
ming driver impacted the car, my friends femoral artery was severed. And though everyone else walked away from the crash my friend died in the hospital after being removed from life support 5 days later. I will never forget how hard she worked to get her life back on track only to have in ripped from her. I will never forget how fragile life is. And I will never forget how one split second can change everything. Ever since then I developed a fear of going highway speeds and it’s just grown into a phobia over the years. Now it’s gotten to the point that I’m having anxiety attacks over the kids coming here for the holidays. I’m so stressed that I’m seeing things."

176104852,"_AT_MENTION_ wow, that sounds amazing!! There you go _AT_MENTION_ there’s a great place to start. Just please, don’t forget about us here"
176104853,Well I had psychosis now I don’t have it I even went back to drugs that caused it and I’m normal because I realized it’s all in your head I think u can have psychosis without sz
176104854,The online reviews have been mixed. Some lost weight or felt few symptoms. Some could not tolerate it at all.
174368686,"3 more: Social isolation - there is simply no point in doing anything other than lying in the bed all day, because of anhedonia and no emotions. Nothing is interesting, funny or entertaining any more. Inability to control my body - sometimes my schizophrenia prevents me from doing things I would do in a situation. Sometimes the voice says “We know you would have done it, but we’re just not going to.” in the sense that “they” are controlling my body Stuttering - while in the hospital, there was a lot of stuttering while speaking; now that problem has disappeared 55 now"
176104855,I think they are really scared of what we will do as psychotic patients so they are prepared to overdose us initially to just make sure we really have been given enough meds. It’s really sad for us. Because when I was on that high dose I felt EXTREMELY zomied. And planning suicide in case things don’t get better and I give up.
174368675,"Well, I was still very sick on Geodon for years and years. Then, in 2008, my pdoc put me on Risperdal Consta injections and I was still very sick for eight years. It was when my pdoc added Seroquel 200 mg to the mix that my positive symptoms of broadcasting and insertions went away almost immediately. Later on, we lowered the Seroquel down to 100 mg without any adverse effects."
176104856,How did you think they were seeing you?
176104857,Yes you did 15

176104859,"I don’t know your situation, but if you do go off meds I would try to get a replacement, like sedative herbs preferably or sedative meds like valium or something like that so your mind doesen’t get overwhelmed. It’s a huge transition for the brain to go off meds, so you need to be well prepared and have multiple options you can try out to keep the mind calm and earthed."
174368683,its ok. Take care
176104860,Everything is just perfect in my life and I’m A ok with it.
176104861,"_PERSON_ its getting betters, there giving me Vancomycin, powerful antibiotic. It could be worse. Thanks for your support. I have alot dead skin falling off i mean alot."
176104862,Go to the appiontment its not a long ordeal is it?
176104863,"The reason is simple: deep rooted trauma. This is what is actually causing so many people to have poor attention spans and some of us to lose our ability to ‘think clearly’. At least, this is what I’ve noticed so far when I see people struggle to pay attention. But our society doesn’t seem to recognize nor understand just what is truly traumatic and how it affects behavior long-term nor how to heal it. Nor does it recognize what healing even is or that such a thing is possible at all. Trauma I think is only recognized to most as something ‘physical’ and rarely recognized as something more subtle that affects nearly everyone subconsciously - which means it gets by without our conscious awareness; meaning we have no way of recognizing it without someone making it apparent. And strangely, it would take someone who understands their own subconscious consciously enough to even help anyone else become aware of the subconscious patterns. Whew. What a wordy and winded thought."
176104864,Genetics mostly is my guess. And drugs prob sped it up. Then religious ideas exasperated it. Like I have friends who did tons of drugs and there very normal.
176104865,"Hm. Yes, maybe this does make you more vulnerable. Didn’t really think about that. But I think people who really want to take advantage of others sense someones vulnerability anyway from body language, expressions, etc?"

176104870,"Oh we moved away from there right after _PERSON_ died. Couldn’t stand that town, South Dakotabis a shithole of a place to raise kids or live. Hubby drive 100 miles each way everyday to work, not worth it. Though with the kids now all teens they do like Halloween things at nursing homes and stuff with friends. But gotta be careful cause a lot of registered sex offenders live in the nursing homes not due to age or health, but location and cost to the state."
176104871,Happy birthday _AT_MENTION_. Enjoy the day off and treat yourself a little bit.
176104872,Just an update I’m now going to be seeing my Pdoc tomorrow afternoon. I took some Geodon last night and this morning because I had some on hand. Obviously it’s not a quick acting drug so I haven’t seen any positive change yet but we’ll see
176104873,Probably not im sure its psychological

I did well in _NAME_ E _NAME_ elementary which was as close to a military school public schools could get. My sister had extreme anxiety there, and my mom took us out. I don’t know how I would have turned if that had happened."
176104883,"Not so sure but my pdr told me that negative symptoms are caused by low dopamine in certain brain regions even when off meds but meds can make negative symptoms worse in some people he said. He talked about antipsychotic invention and deinstitutionalization, he said that some patients were still not able to function in society even on meds. Now we call what these ppl have negative symptoms."
176104884,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! Just enjoying the sun right now
176104885,I see that. Maybe I’ll just comply with their suggestions
176104886,I only lasted two days without meds before I went completely psychotic and had to be hospitalized. That was four years ago.

176104890,"I got the book in a charity shop, so didn’t read the Amazon review, healing animals (and I’m not using any kind of racist code here, real life non-human creatures that we share our planet with) is something that is practiced by some, as is abusing them, it is done through the projection and absorbtion of energy or qi, and is quite difficult owing to the different physiology and metabolism. This is why I call it so called black magic, as it is often practiced as a means of controlling human beings, just as medication which is tested on animals is used to control schizophrenics. There is nothing wrong with so called black magic just as there is nothing wrong with gong fu or any other martial art, the challenge with all these things is to do them as artistically as possible with minimum harm to others.

And to be honest YES before I ever had drug addiction issues I had been forced to be compliant with abilify… It was easy to start using drugs once I turned eighteen and try to fix my brain without being told I was a chronic schizophrenic. Weed worked the best for me. But I can’t use drugs anymore. I would probably smoke weed if it worked anymore, but it makes me feel sick now. And until weed is legal I won’t smoke it so I can get a job or pass a drug test. Even CBD can get to to fail a drug test. I know someone who lost her job from CBD."

176104954,"Those with ASD can have social anxiety, but they are not the same thing . Here are some quotes from a PDF I found . Previous research has demonstrated a significant overlap between symptoms of SAD and ASD. A large proportion of indi-viduals with ASD also fulfill the criteria for SAD (_PERSON_ 2007; White _PERSON_ 2009; _PERSON_ et al. 2008). _USER_ID_-larly, elevated autistic traits are prevalent in individuals diagnosed with SAD (_PERSON_. 2007; _PERSON_ and _NAME_ 2011). The symptomatic overlap between the conditions is mainly found in areas of social interaction and social skills, whereas restricted and repetitive behaviors and atypical social cognition may be unique to ASD (White _PERSON_ 2011). Learning disabilities and language impairments are preva-lent in a large proportion of children and adolescents with ASD (_PERSON_ 2006), but are typically not seen in SAD. Finally, social anxiety is more likely in older, high-func-tioning children and adolescents with ASD, suggesting that increased awa
reness of social difficulties may be a contrib-uting factor (White _PERSON_ 2009). Individual differences in SAD symptoms in individuals with ASD may be related to atypical functioning and struc-ture of the _USER_ID_, a subcortical area linked to fear pro-cessing, association learning and social cognition, particu-larly orienting to human faces (_PERSON_ 2003; _PERSON_ 2013). In line with this, South et al. (2011) found that autonomic fear conditioning in a group with ASD was positively related to social anxiety, but negatively related to autistic traits. Taken together, this suggests that a dimen-sional approach is important for understanding the biologi-cal mechanisms underlying ASD.The overlap between ASD and SAD can be attributed to a number of causes. First, it is likely that some individu-als with ASD or autistic traits develop social anxiety over time, as a consequence of repeated difficulties in social interactions (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 2009; White _PERSON_ 2011). Secondly, the high incidence of soci
al anxiety in biological relatives of people with ASD suggest a degree of genetic overlap (_PERSON_ and _NAME_ 1999). On the other hand, there is also a concern that superficial similarities in overt behaviors result in inflated correlations between self- or parent-report targeting the two conditions (_PERSON_ 2014). For example, a lack of close friendship could be the result of reduced social motivation (_PERSON_ 2012b) or a lack of social skills (_PERSON_ and White 2007) as well as anxiety driven avoidance. While overlapping, there is also ample evidence showing that SAD and ASD are distinct phenomena. For example, relatives of people with a diagnosis of ASD are more likely to have signs of ASD than SAD, suggestive of a dissociable genetic background (e.g. _PERSON_ and _NAME_ 1999). There are also differences in phenomenology between the two conditions. Whereas repetitive behaviors and a preference for sameness are characteristic of ASD, these behaviors are rarely seen in SAD. Similarly, some individuals wi
th ASD may prefer to be by themselves, whereas individuals with SAD typically desire social interaction (e.g. White _PERSON_ 2011; _PERSON_ et al. 2012a). ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 10803_2016_Article_2978.pdf 1073.54 KB Spectrum | Autism Research News – 5 Jun 17 In autism, social difficulties may set the stage for anxiety | Spectrum |...

They start babbling or start saying things that make no sense. I don’t know what it is. It’s actually a double-edged sword, I don’t want to make people nervous but it does amuse me a little. I think it’s because I kind of slip in and out of reality myself but I’m used to it in myself and it doesn’t bother me but I think it confuses people and the only thing I can figure out is that they aren’t sure whether I’m crazy or their crazy because they see me talking and acting normally so they might think it’s them. It all hearkens back to my theory from when I was in my twenties in the eighties: there’s a lot of people in the world in public who have a very tenuous grip on their sanity and it don’t take much out of the ordinary to rock their boat."

Coping skills such as meditation, listening to music, and such can greatly benefit sufferers of a mental illness. Sometimes the way I like to think about it is that the first year of diagnosis is like level one of a video game character. The first 10 levels are sometimes more difficult, one is still figuring out how it all works, then pretty soon you’ll be strong enough to realize that you’ve come a long way since level one."

It’s beyond unreasonable that your pdoc won’t let you try one. Everybody tries them, not just people with sza. Everyone gets depressed from time to time.

She instead agreed to prescribe me more Klonopin on a as needed basis. I’ve been on all the mood stabilizers and most of the atypical antipsychotics out there. They either damaged my health or made things worse for me. She really understands this. What an honest doctor.
176104995,Without getting into details she’s just not being honest with me. She fooled me into thinking she was a honest person. I’m really getting fed up with the low quality of these therapists in my area. I don’t know if I’m going to stick around with her.

They seem fake. That’s the videos that makes me want to make a real video of informative educated Information and have some dialogue along with it answering questions.

I don’t do coping strategies, but she’ll be helpful if I do ask for ideas. She’s the one who saved my oldest from the predatory therapist she works with. I told her about conversations _PERSON_ had with his therapist, in front of me and him alone, and my therapist dropped an “anonymous” grievance on behalf of _PERSON_. That therapist knew is was my kid cause of one sentence we quoted. Now the whole clinic dropped _PERSON_ as a client. No one who sees me or _PERSON_ can see another of our family, so with the shortage, _PERSON_ is without, and our insurance we have to stay at this clinic. So stupid. Oh, and the therapist also convinced _PERSON_’s pdoc to drop him. But we didn’t find out till we went for his appt last month. They never called to say we were dropped 
from either one, just cancelled 6 appts. And his pediatrician cannot write for Zyprexa here, so he’s on list for new pdoc too at the clinic. I’m hoping we can get him off that ???? quick, the ritalin is gone at least, and grades are way better."

I’m so tired, but I’m terrified of what could possibly happen tonight as I try to go to sleep. I’m hearing different reactions in my mind. Some voices are shocked, and some seem a little pleased they can hurt me. I constantly battle the voices in my mind because they’re the voices of people I know. Sometimes they tell me they’re trapped, and sometimes they tell me I’m trapped. Sometimes they get angry with me and I feel it’s justified, and sometimes I think I accidentally hurt whatever the voices truly are. It’s emotional because it’s my friends and family I hear hurting. I don’t know how to handle this, because if the hallucinations are trying to hurt me, and I fight back, I have no idea what will happen. And then I remind myself…it’s all in my head right?

176105082,"then you are dead… but no, i don’t think they are gonna kill you. Why do you think it? Did they say some things that show they wanna kill you?"
176105083,Usually 10 to 15 years
176105084,How to admit a friend to the ward?
176105085,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ . Means a lot to me.
176105086,Paranoia. It keeps me on my toes and keeps me second guessing every relationship I have. Sure I do ok most times but that is just from lessons learned and ignoring that inner voice that makes me question everything. It really can be a very insidious thing that you don’t know is creeping up on you till it explodes. All’s that works for me is staying in the moment and working on keeping my stress low. Low stress is really good and still I get my moments.
176105087,"I start thinking about what I am going to do when I don’t have all the answers to issues and questions. When the answers come, I usually end up doing something else."
176105088,"I sometimes have urges to sell everything, buy a camper, and live a nomadic life style for a few years. Would be an adventure"
176105089,"I was on Risperdal from 2011 to November 2019. I had sexual problems, frequent peeing, anxiety, and mood swings."
174368734,Yes I was much more busy when psychotic. Little negative symptoms compared to now.
176105090,"If you feel bad about it when they ask tell them its a sensitive subject and in your case thats the truth. I don’t think Tattoos are cheap so in the mean time if it still causes you a lot of grief I suggest a cloth wrapping. If its hot where you are just a light linen bandage when you go out. People don’t generally deserve to be told your life story so if you don’t want to give it, just tell em that got an injury. If you like sports say it was sports related or if you do any home projects say you had a run in with the table saw. Either way what matters is how you feel about being asked and how you feel about telling them off. If lies feel bad don’t lie just tell them its not their concern."
176105091,"One time I was in hospital, and out of no where I heard sounds of different people. It sounded like different people praying. But no I haven’t heard sounds like the grocery store."
174368731,"I don’t have anything interesting to say. I just got upset. any who I don’t think the answer is going to be an easy one. Drugs are really really dumb tools. I believe in their ability to provide relief and maybe there will be effective uses of them further into the life span of the research into this illness, but I don’t think they’re a refined answer to how nuanced schizophrenia is. I just don’t have that kind of optimism."

176105095,"Threatening to go off meds, instead if finding a solution that would keep you sane and productive, isn’t a very healthy way to go into this. I get that it sucks and no one wants to be on meds, but different meds effect different body systems. If the meds you’re in are hurting your kidneys, just switch to a med that doesn’t affect the kidneys. No need to ditch your needs altogether. Especially if you need them, which, being on them, I’m assuming you do."
176105096,You have no reason to live. I guess I don’t. I get harassed everyday. I have no place to go if I need help. So I’m screwed.

176105105,"I have issues driving, even 3 minutes down our relatively quiet street to bring my son to and from work. I’m just not used to driving anymore. I’m glad you made it through okay."
176105106,I am sorry to hear that. The best you can do is try. I seem to be doing okay at work but I rarely socialize like going out for lunch with everyone and stuff. I have to be careful not to talk too much. I try to just talk about work. I can say really stupid stuff too. I forgot what I did once but I was about to get fired once and I played the disability card. Felt bad for it but I didn’t get fired that day.
176105107,My longest was in the fall of 2008 when I was in the psych ward for a month.

176105114,"_AT_MENTION_ I quit cigs in 2016 and vaping later on in that year. I’m still using the NRTs to this day. From all the experience I have with NRTs, lozenges are the best way to go. They dissolve within 5 minutes of usage. The gum can cause stomach problems if not used correctly. The inhaler is literally just another vape. The patch is very weak (even the 21mg), can cause skin irration, and is pretty much useless if it falls right off. Hope this helps. Good luck !"
176105115,"My endeavour to do the unthinkable, to go beyond everything is a bit grandiose"
174368744,"I don’t know what it would be like without meds. I think at first I would have difficulty sleeping because my Saphris puts me to sleep at night so I don’t know if I would have a hard time falling asleep without it. And right now I seem to be in a high mood so I probably would not sleep much. But without my antidepressant I would probably soon fall to a low mood and be sleeping all the time. Then the pendulum would start swinging and I would go back and forth being very unstable and somewhere in there eventually end up psychotic again. But who knows, maybe I would be just fine, you never know. Hopefully the pharmacies stay open."
176105116,My Psychologist charges the same as my Psychiatrist !! Makes no sense.
176105117,My partner says I definitely struggle even if I don’t see it a lot of the time … I don’t think I’ll get it as I’m STILL waiting to hear back it’s been over 3 weeks.

I should have had more resolve and persevered with my old job. I am ??????"
174368742,You have schizophrenia just like what your Drs told you. Maybe you’re not believing it because you have some delusions and because meds arent working well for those delusions.
176105119,"So I posted a little while ago about going off my meds. Well, like a true idiot, I ignored the sage wisdom of everyone in my life and everyone on here. I felt good, so I stopped my meds. I’m sza and went into a very short manic episode and then crashed into depression and psychosis. I didn’t really tell many people this but I ended in the hospital after I attempted suicide. Now I’m trying to recuperate. I was on track to be a mental health counselor and it looks like that dream died because of my illness. And I don’t know what I want to do. I got 3 years into school and now I’m either being dismissed or told to take a long time off. I kept it a secret that I was in school for mental health because it seems ironic to so many people and on this forum I just was me, not “counselor” me, just me. So here’s to being real and honest. 2019 in general sucked. I lost both of my remaining grandparents a week apart, I got into a car accident that totaled both cars and got sued over it, I had 3 
hospitalizations, 1 suicide attempt, lost my chance at school, lost my job… and here I am, a hot mess for 2020. Thanks for listening."
176105120,You need to overcome the psychological barrier of motivating yourself to exercise daily and eat nutritiously. 50lbs is a lot of weight to lose and would take at 5 months to shed if going by a 10lbs/month schedule.

176105128,There was a family crisis. My immediate response was ‘stop all meds’. I think it’s because I can’t take the External stress so I want to induce a self crisis so I don’t have to think about the external one. Might not make sense but that is the really strange impulse I get. Problem is I am close to throwing my meds down the toilet so I physically don’t have them in the house. Think I need help

176105142,"Therapy definitely isnt for everyone. It’s kind of like how meditation isnt for everyone. I HATE meditation. Therapy also requires some trial and error, just like meds. Not every therapist is right for every patient. It took me a while to find a therapist that was helpful, some even being harmful to me. If you’re struggling with depression I recommend looking for a therapist that deals directly with CBT and giving it a few more chances before you give up on it. Tell them your concerns and experiences with your past attempts at therapy, and also talk about your expectations and what you hope to accomplish. These are all things that are important to talk about with your treatment team."

174368759,"OUP Academic O4.4. REAL TIME FMRI NEUROFEEDBACK TARGETING STG AND DMN REDUCES AUDITORY... AbstractBackground. Auditory hallucinations (AH) are one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) and constitute a significant source of suffering and disabi In the STG-focused NFB experiment, subjects were trained to upregulate the STG activity while listening to their own voice recording and downregulate it while ignoring a stranger’s voice recording in the course of 21 min NFB session. The DMN-CEN focused NFB experiment was conducted about 1 month later to minimize the carry over effects from the STG-focused NFB and was designed to help SZ patients modulate their DMN and CEN networks. DMN and CEN networks were defined individually for each subject. The goal of the task was to increase CEN-DMN anti-correlations. To achieve that patients were provided with meditation strategies to guide their performance. Results In the STG-focused NFB task, significant STG activation reduction was found in the comparison 
of pre- relative to post-NFB in the condition of ignoring another person’s voice (p<0.05), FWE-TFCE corrected. AH were also significantly reduced (p<0.01). Importantly, significant correlation was found between reductions in the STG activation and AH reductions (r=.83). In the DMN-CEN focused NFB task … AH were significantly reduced in post- relative to pre-NFB comparison (p<0.02). Finally, there was a significant correlation between individual scores in mPFC-STG connectivity and AH reductions."

176105216,My pdoc says I have TD but my neurologist says I have Parkinsons. I noticed when I got my latestest shot of Invega Sustenna my symptoms(hand tremoring and mouth quivering ) got worse. Current I’m taking 2 mg of Cogentin. Should I ask my pdoc to bump it up to 3mg?
176105217,Should I go to the hospital my voices are getting bad and telling me I am gonna get tortured forever and that every one was In this death game with the illuminati and aliens. They also say they took full control of my body and waiting for me to die so they can tourture me I also have a whole range of delusions that stem from my nerves and tactile ones as well . I also thing no one is any one and the world is gone

176105220,I had these kind of “light” hallucinations as a child. Used to see bright spots of colors filling my room in the dark. I saw these colors even when I put my face into the pillow closing my eyes. It was wild.

Here is a DP pen I jazzed up a bit with some leftover drills from my starry night painting. Not a huge fan of the pink ones and did my best to eliminate it I used double sided tape to stick them on. You might have to click the pen to view it correctly… not sure whats happened with it. I’m hoping to test out some polymer clay if I can this weekend. People use it to cover the pens to make them more comfortable. I’ve been lucky and got some pencil grips to assist.

174368778,Not only is it a bit selfish not to bath - and make others smell your stink - its actually quite relaxing to bung a bit of _USER_ID_ in one and chill out for an hour with some music and a few candles. Come on mate - do you really want the reputation of being stinky? And then possibly get paranoid cos your wondering why people are giving you funny looks? I get the negative symptoms - but there are times you just got to take responsibilty and wash yourself. Its about practising supporting your positive mh well-being too.

176105250,I think about it maybe half the time but it may be better if I were working and less anxious. I’m trying to come on here less and do other stuff more. Maybe I’ll start reading on the bus instead of going online soon. I need to live my normal life more!

Anyways ive been taking some kind of testerone increasing supplement and a herb supplement for men. It slightly counteracts the numbness and shrinkage. Personally im just gonna get some viagra and switch to a low dose of abilify when the chance arises.

174368777,My first diagnoses was mood disorder.
176105257,Don’t give up hope. I’ve been on a number of meds and heard voices for years actually daily.
176105258,I wouldn’t pay attention. Teens can be jerks sometimes. They don’t know who you are.
176105259,"_AT_MENTION_ that would be awesome!!! You are so creative, I’m sure you could contribute a lot to the song"
176105260,I think clozapine. And maybe seroquel. Because they are known to have least extrapyrimidal symptoms and I’m guessing restlessness sort of falls into that category. Double check with your pdoc though!
176105261,I’m glad you’re seeing the doctor soon _AT_MENTION_ . Good luck!
176105262,"I am here, with all my sensations and thoughts, scared from the others, scared also from non-existent things, Maybe i feel unloved, i feel dumb now, doomed to always be ill, thats the main thing i think… Can my med work one day, friends? Maybe its not working still, cause ive started to be treated very late in my illness. Will i be able to start living normally without feeling as a weirdo, without the paranoia from the others? Ive tried all the aps, really, my friends… One doc even told me, that ive tried too many… They just dont help my paranoia yet. My zyprexa works but not enough to have a life without a burden… My current pdoc didnt offer anything else the last time i saw him… He sees that the meds dont help me much. But were you burdened at home before even though that you were taking meds? Did you end up by recovering even in your surprise? I think, that things like my paranoia just are stopping me… Its even physical so its hard… I fight here, but i wonder who here recovered wit
hout even expecting it from a previous despair about your own future? For the rest, i try to fight. The somatics are a speacial thing also, they cant be helped much by meds, i work on them with positivity. My doc says, the somatics are the manfiestation of a psychological problem. But yeah, i wonder if its paranoia when you think, that you will never be at the level of the others, scared to face them in the outside world by thinking, that your sz is visible… I wonder if those kind of thinking is demons too? lol… I guess when you are fine you feel awesome and invincible isnt it? I wonder if my paranoia is my biggest problem… Hugs to all"
176105263,I don’t think they do if you are talking about the voices You’ll be fine
176105264,Maybe take a nap for an hour during the day. I do that sometimes.

Will leave open so you can get some support for a specific question. You must realize that 2 years later the original posters may not be part of the community any longer.
176105266,"Not talking about sz, but when adding Rexulti to Wellbutrin, does it make the AD work better? Or is it the AP that’s working somehow? I’m asking because I’ve been on Wellbutrin for about a month now. I’m on it for the side effect of decreased appetite, but I didn’t get that side effect until the day after I started Rexulti. Rexulti commonly causes weight gain and I cannot for the life of me find any mention of weight loss or decreased appetite. So did the Rexulti cause the Wellbutrin to work differently? Historically I’ve always gained weight super fast on every atypical I’ve ever tried. 100 lbs in 6 months on Saphris 40 lbs in 1.5 months on Latuda 10 lbs in 2 weeks on Abilify 45 lbs in 2-3 months on Risperidone Etc… I’ve tried over a dozen, same for all of them. Expected the same of the Rexulti but am dumbfounded that my appetite is all but gone. I’m so confused by this! Happy, very happy, but confused. Lol"
176105267,"I haven’t ordered from them, so I’m just guessing, to be honest. But of all the sites I’ve visited that sells flower, Tweedle seems to have the best description of each flower.

176105276,_AT_MENTION_ What have they done? Stayed with you or recommended a new treatment team?
176105277,"I’m so sorry this is your experience. I hope you can find some support. Have you ever tried going to a Clubhouse for the mentally ill? I’ve gone to one near me and people are nice there and they go on social outings etc. it’s an international organization. By the way, in case I haven’t already said it, welcome to the forum."
176105278,That’s because the brain is powerful and capable of creating anything.
176105279,"Even if you were really enlightened, you do get my point about how many people you could influence right? It’s a damn shame but becoming famous is about as likely as being struck by lightning. I would think that the lack of celebrity would lead you to believe that you were at peace and didn’t need to go enlighten others. If you were famous, however, you could argue that it’s your duty to help somehow. But again none of us are famous. If I were famous, that would be so awesome… Oh also I don’t mean to come off argumentative, if I am then my bad, I’m just really tired. I’ve been up a long time. Just trying to make conversation"

176105280,Does anyone else suffer from Scrupulosity? I have since 1994. I’m just now asking my Doctor to help me with it. What is Scrupulosity ? A form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) involving religious or moral obsessions. Scrupulous individuals are overly concerned that something they thought or did might be a sin or other violation of religious or moral doctrine.
176105281,"There’s probably little you can do. Try not to let it ever come to fisticuffs, and I say that because you probably have more resentment now after your note didn’t work… maybe I’m reaching though. My BIL didnt communicate what he wanted. He had aims to move a family of three to the opposite coast where he was raised. But he waited and played his hand after the child was born. Do you understand my reservations at this juncture? To boot I said I was starving in the kitchen and he didn’t say anything. It was just the two of us. Which brings me to ask you: do you think it’s related to money/family money?"
176105282,"We kids were punished for fighting so showing anger at anyone was a high risk thing. I do remember throwing a cup of coffee at a bully. It’s as nervy as I’ve ever been. i know how you feel, though. It’s as if you risk everything just to show how you feel."

176105295,"I’m sorry about my med post yesterday. Normally I am completely pro med. When I get at the end of the injection time I begin getting weird. Probably need to get it 3 times a week but med transport won’t take you to pick up prescription. I am at a point where I am very upset over my negatives and those made by my meds, but I will NOT go off my shot. That was just a short delusion of being better without. My family deserves a calm me, even with a very messy house. Holy crap, sorry guys."
176105296,That’s great! Hang in there. It does get better

176105300,DAY 5 I started bargaining with myself. It’s not necessary to live a healthy lifestyle. I would like to put this idea in the “to hard busket”. I don’t beat myself up over it. The backpain will do it for me. Why can’t I get a grip of this project ?
176105301,I am on invega sister drug and when I was on risperidone I didn’t have agoraphobia but I was having huge weight gain
176105302,It’s been a long time … why you ask?
176105303,I don’t see contentment or lack thereof as something that solid. It changes minute by minute.

176105307,It might be worth a try.
176105308,I am the bad apple
176105309,I also used to get chest pain and palpitations. Turns out it was pleurisy. Basically it was my lungs and not my actual heart.
176105310,I also have a freewill problem Every time I eat my breakfast and lunch. I have no choice to eat a little more until my stomach feels tight I blame the noises in my room. They trigger my mental illness

176105312,"Sounds interesting. If I liked bay leaf more, I’d try it."
174368795,If I listed all the things I have ever been diagnosed with it would be a very long list. I just say schizophrenia now instead of chronic paranoid schizophrenia but I have been diagnosed with damn near everything in the DSM except for a mood disorder.
176105313,I guess a fetus has to speak up any way she/he can. “Not wanting me is breaking my heart.”
176105314,"How long did you try it for, and for how many minutes? My pdoc recommended 30 minutes a day. I’ve been on it a week, and while I haven’t noticed anything yet, I’m not giving up. This article by the Mayo Clinic says it can take two or more weeks."
176105315,I do think that. but I also know I’ve been told it’s my brain doing that and that’s not normal or an experience of other people. I’m torn sort of. because part of me wants to get off meds and be a hermit in the woods and part of me wants to try to find a good medication. zyprexa is supposed to be a great med… but if I take even 10mg of zyprexa I get worse and really strange thoughts. and then I start thinking that the doctors are giving me meds to make me go crazy.
176105316,Yes also cognitive symptoms.
174368799,I take 300mg clozapine and have no problem except drooling

Next week I will be on 1mg Rexulti and 3mg Risperdal. Maybe 2mg Rexulti and 2mg Risperdal next. Negatives will get better but not as better as on Vraylar only."

176105330,"People who want to sell you things usually say to buy right away because they have a short supply - but it’s all a trick.

176105354,"I have 50 years worth of photos to go through and condense down into one photo box. That’s all I’m allowing myself to keep. But how do I begin to decide what I want to keep and what I want to pass along. It’s so overwhelming. And back in the day I always had the free second copies made, so it’s double the pictures to figure out what to do with. And when my kids were little I didn’t just take one picture of them being cute doing something, it was ten pictures of basically the same thing at different angles. I want to just throw the redundancies away but it seems sacrilegious. And all the negatives, oh my goodness. I can’t get myself to even get started and I’m running out of time."

176105356,You’re a case with no insight. Do you realize that?
176105357,"I hope your friend and all the other amazing and brave medical professionals know how much people appreciate their superhuman efforts to fight this virus. We have a bunch of personal protective equipment (PPE) donation drives in CA where the local community (everyday citizens as well as businesses) are donating their unused masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to the local hospitals. I’ve heard that some people are sewing their own masks and including a pocket in it to put HEPA filter material that they are repurposing from HEPA filters for vacuum cleaners. It’s not clear how protective those homemade masks are but hopefully it’s better than nothing. I heard a news story last week that one hospital was using a uv light source to sanitize used masks for re-use. I’m not sure what type of uv light source they are using."

176105368,"no I’m not. lots of paranoia. I can’t watch The _NAME_’s t.v. show anymore, I feel too many references to my life."
176105369,Therapy helps some people on here. But I’ve always been suspicious of it.

176105371,"I understand this! I know that I was talking about hating myself and burning my pictures, but I don’t remember actually deleting pictures in my computer/phone. I just cannot seem to recall when I did it and how I did so."
176105372,"Yes, once being diagnosed there is no return. Ok there is always room for improvement like change of habits, but that has nothing to do with sz. The good thing i am not confused anymore. My mind is clear for a long time."
174368806,Yes I can. I have to reschedule an appointment anyway.
176105373,"Well, it depends, the shortest possible is now about 5 years but that is not average. That’s mostly things like cancer drugs. The authors of this study were concerned because the people in medical school today will experience several doublings of knowledge while they are in school and in just a few years after graduation, but how will they learn all that? Increased knowledge has to be applied to be beneficial."

176105383,"I have the experience that when I am off meds and drink, it sends me into a manic frenzy, and my voices are minimalized but my delusions go off the charts. The weird thing is that when I drink while on meds my voices get worse. all in all it’s much better and I’m much happier on meds."
176105384,Bachelor’s of science degree in nursing. _PERSON_ made my degree totally worth less in the long run. I did work in the field for about ten years before I lost my license due to sza.
176105385,"I had fainting from olanzapine. I understand it worries you. But keep calm and tell your psychiatrist. It is possible that it automatically goes away by getting used to this med, for me it did. Or perhaps they will decrease the dose a bit when you are stable for a longer while."
176105386,im supposed to take 3 times 5 mg a day… low dose not 120 mg wow yes thats a strong dose friend!
176105387,I had a strawberry pastry and a chocolate donut from the local bakery.

176105391,Yes I’m in Idaho. It’s only 6:30pm here where are you at?
176105392,Sometimes my body temperature drops. Once it was 95.5 I think. Keep an eye on it because you don’t want to get hypothermia.
176105393,It sounds a bit like blue sky black death
176105394,No I’m not. Very strange
176105395,"Yeah, the dp is like that for me too. I dont know what aps are doing to me, and im going off them too."
176105396,I’m doing okay. Was just thinking about supper. Probably just going to make some pasta.
174368808,"I could see how it might help-- you’ve got to take inventory of what you need, make a list, go to a public space, follow directions on said list, interact socially with the cashier (unless you use self-checkout)… Lots of tasks in one event. Even cooking might be helpful-- you’ve got to identify ingredients, identify measurements, put things together in the correct sequence, cook for the appropriate time, etc."
176105397,Ask your doctor about your symptoms? Benzodiazepines are used for treating anxiety.
176105398,have a good night/morning… Thanks for the conversation
174368809,It says your profile is private…could you feel emotions at 10mg? I’ve switched from invega to Abilify 200mg which is equivalent to 10mg and I have no emotions rn. It’s the invega still in my system but I’m wondering if I’ll have any once it’s out.
176105399,"One month in and the invega isn’t even out of your system yet. And you’ve even said you’re getting symptoms. There’s always a honeymoon period when stopping meds. But you’ll crash and burn, just like the rest of us have."
176105400,"It really made me realize to commit to my daily habits to paint the bigger picture. Yeah, everything does change when you leave government confinement."
174368811,"10mg is the minimum dose for schizophrenia, I wasn’t stable even on 25mg. I needed 4mg Risperdal to be stable. Risperdal is stronger. My negative symptoms were better on Abilify but I developped more serious side effects than negatives, it changed my personality for the worse, I became impulsive, had multiple addiction issues and hypersexuality."
176105401,"I have had to cut my spending down to £850 a month. With some smart decisions though, I still have some luxuries like sky tv and Netflix. Saving money is not really possible."
176105402,"Thank you for your support everyone! Even though after work I am really stressed and sometimes have minor convulsions I am forced to take 0.5 clonazepam until I get fully accustomed to my work. My mom is supportive and says I can stop working any time or just ask to leave for home when I feel unwell, but for my outlook I have to stay the whole shift no matter what and I will feel worse if I leave"
176105403,"Not really. Some spiritual stuff is going on, but if you bite into it you’re just going to get crazier. So it makes perfect sense to ignore it. Or laugh at it when it’s funny. Don’t go crazy."

174368814,I read that antipsychotics reduce histamine levels. So it makes sense.
176105417,"One thing you might write about is how many commitments that are classified “voluntary” are not voluntary at all, because when a person is being processed into a ward they are so caught up in the process that they aren’t aware that they have options. In Oklahoma a person can ask for a jury of six people to determine if they are going to be committed or not. I’ve tried that several times, with poor results. It’s impossible to prepare for a trial on such short notice. Basically, there is no such thing as a “voluntary commitment”. I’m not saying that is good or bad. It’s just the way things are. It might be a good issue to write about."

176105422,When are you due for your next injection?
176105423,"A pdoc inpatient once told me that, if I worked in therapy really hard and overcame being treatment resistant to most meds, I may be able to work part time someday in a library. That was almost 16 years ago. Whatta jerk!"
176105425,"thank you, do you know if it covers buy a plot of land and ordering a prefab home for it. I’ve heard some horror stories of section 8 housing or is that different then fixed income housing?"
176105426,"I’ve worked a few jobs but never found a job on my own. My parents helped me get every job I had because my boss was a family friend or I was literally working for them. Now they’re retired, sold their business I don’t have many skills but I’m getting better each day all I can do. Working on taking my meds. Maybe one day I can work. Or I’m gonna be a famous rapper one day… Im 29 btw."
176105427,I sure did feel like that in mornings for about three weeks but then I guess my body adjusted to it because now I don’t have the hangover.

176105431,"I think my anorexia triggered it because I wasn’t anxious or depressed. My anorexia was largely caused by my OCD, which made me obsessive compulsive about not eating and exercising a lot. And this morphed into my anorexia."

176105437,My PMS is worse the longer my cycle is. If I start sooner I don’t notice any difference but if my period is late I get severely irritable and depressed and sometimes even get voices. When my period starts I get relief.
174368816,And here I thought _AT_MENTION_ was gonna bring down the hammer on this one. But instead hits him with a subtle jab to the left pectoral muscle. Op you’re wasting your precious money if you do this sorry but meds are the best we got. And $500 is a lot of money.
176105438,I took my meds this morning. I take my Invega and Wellbutrin before breakfast and Leponex before going to sleep.
174368815,"I think it has, undoubtedly, but I can’t blame it all on sz. Alcohol has been a huge factor in bringing me down. It’s been three years and four months since I last drank. That is very positive."

174368820,"Yes, I have it very much so. It started in eighth grade when I started getting religious intrusive thoughts involving God and the Devil. Then I started to repeat prayers in the exact same order, eventually just adding things on it, making it like a 15 minute prayer. After this, I started obsessing over reading the Scriptures and to pray constantly. This went on for a while without any treatment and it kept getting much, much worse to the point of me being incapable of doing simple tasks. Then in the tenth grade, I got treatment for my schizophrenia, which also happened to have a religious theme to it, and I got put on an antidepressant called celexa. This made it a lot better along with getting therapy for it also. Now, I’m still struggling, but it has gotten better. I’m just doing worse now then I was previously. It’s still hard to sleep at night because of my OCD thoughts, and also it’s hard to pray because I constantly get intrusive thoughts while praying. I’m probably going to change 
medication, though. I also think that if I might touch something, I’ll get possessed or that I’m sinning. It’s a cycle, too, where I might do better during the summer, then do worse in the fall. You’re not alone, as my older brother also has it and is getting treatment for it."
176105444,"I’m doing okay, 30 days now until the big move to California"

176105447,I get a little SSI on top of SS. I would still qualify but they would eat up my inheritance first if it weren’t in my sister’s name.
176105448,I used to take 40mg latuda in the morning and 80mg at night. That was enough for me to be a total mess in the mornings and I truly had such heavy eyes and was almost drewling. Now I take all of it at night and I’m down from 120mg to 80mg. Do you get tired in the mornings ? I feel really good in the mornings since I started taking all of my latuda at night time.

174368837,I used to have severe dizziness on clozapine. I had to reduce the dose to a very low level and now I’m better. Don’t suffer in silence and talk to your pdoc would be my advice.
174368826,I am wondering if 100mg could have any effect on the positive symptoms.
176105457,"I was having trouble hearing the lyrics as well. For a minute, I thought something was wrong with my ears!"
174368818,was it your impression that the pdoc considered the two diagnosis as different?

Can people with schizophrenia become psychiatrists? What do you think about it? And sorry, English is not my first language."
176105459,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I live in South Korea. Thank you for understanding. I know that I shouldn’t think this way, but I feel like I can’t help but think this way… I remember watching tv and there was this young girl with a brother who has an intellectual disability. Her mom was talking about how her daughter will never get married because of her brother because someone has to take care of him. I certainly don’t want to be that burden. Sometimes, I think I’m just a nuisance to everyone. I worry a lot about my brother’s future."
176105460,I never understood as needed drugs. I get my script filled every month and they don’t give me a problem taking it every day. My therapist gives me a problem if I don’t take it every day. So PRN terminology is confusing. Don’t even know what PRN stands for lol

Btw, I took a multivitamin for the first time today. I noticed that I felt a bit better, but after some hours I unfortunately experienced some increased anxiety, have no idea why. Could be something else though. I will maybe give it some more time. But thought maybe it would be a good idea to get a blood test."

174368836,"MDPI Kynurenines and the Endocannabinoid System in Schizophrenia: Common Points... Schizophrenia, which affects around 1% of the world’s population, has been described as a complex set of symptoms triggered by multiple factors. However, the exact background mechanisms remain to be explored, whereas therapeutic agents with excellent... Schizophrenia has many aspects in which both kynurenines and the ECS are involved. Although both have already been separately reviewed in detail, their overlapping functions, mechanisms, and potential interaction in schizophrenia have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present review aimed to highlight such aspects. Accordingly, the most well-known overlapping areas include dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and _USER_ID_ transmission regulation via cannabinoids and KYNA. Moreover, the most possible receptor mediator for KYNA in this mechanism is the astrocytic ?7nAChR given that NMDAR inhibition by KYNA does not seem to influence glutamate release [ 61 ]. Inflammatory 
mechanisms contributing to the development of schizophrenia are complex and widespread and need to be studied more thoroughly. The overlapping structural, pharmacological, and anatomical properties between GPR35 and CBRs are also promising candidates for regulating the common aspects of inflammation associated with schizophrenia. Though the treatment of schizophrenia still remains challenging, a better understanding of the possible connections between kynurenines and the ECS could introduce novel therapeutic compounds and targets for treatment. Such compounds could also compensate for limitations of currently available medications. While KAT II inhibitors and CBD are promising, it will be interesting to determine whether co-administration would yield a synergistic effect. Nonetheless, additional studies are needed to adequately explore the interaction between kynurenines and the ECS and to better understand their separate functioning. Finally, parallel alterations in kynurenines/the KP and the ECS are present 
not only in schizophrenia but also in other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease [ 38 , 335 , 336 , 337 ]. Thus, studying the interaction between kynurenines and associated elements and the ECS might also help us further understand mechanisms and disorders apart from schizophrenia."

176105472,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, cutting out sugar makes a HUGE difference! I haven’t eaten desserts for about five months now, and I cut out ginger ale and powdered drink crystals. It’s made a huge impact on how much easier it is to consistently lose weight…and I never crave sugar anymore. Keep it up! _AT_MENTION_ Ya just gotta be gentle when it comes to PMS. Don’t even get on the scale until your period is gone. I maintained one week instead of losing, because of my water weight, but then I lost three pounds right away. Don’t torture yourself!"

176105476,I never understood that logic but I later found out the reason I didn’t understand it is because I didn’t know what it was like to not love yourself I thought that not loving one’s self would be impossible but then I started taking notice of some people and how critical they were about their imperfections and mistakes. I realized people were saying ‘if you’re so critical of yourself how would it be possible to not be even more judgmental of others.’ ( “Love is demanding without understanding.” )
174368834,"I got the paper! Thanks for reminding me about the existence of Sci Hub. https://sci-hub.tw/10.1515/revneuro-2019-0057 A _NAME_-analysis indicated that a 5 ?m/l increase in plasma homocysteine levels is associated with a 70% increase in the risk of developing schizophrenia (_PERSON_, 2006). There is a 2.15 odds ratio (95% confidence interval = 1.39–3.32; p = 5.3 × 10?4) increase in risk schizophrenia for every 1 standard deviation increase in the natural log-transformed plasma totalhomocysteine levels (_PERSON_, 2015) Plasma homocysteine levels are positively correlated with negative symptoms (_PERSON_, 2014). A review article (_PERSON_, 2014) indicated that negative symptoms of schizophrenia are positively correlatedwith homocysteine levels. Plasma homocysteine levelsare positively correlated with depression in schizophrenia (_PERSON_, 2014) We also detail how targeting dysregulations of the transsulfuration pathway and dysregulations of other pathways that stem from dysregulations of the trans
sulfuration pathway, via an add-on treatment to mainlineantipsychotics, could be an effective treatment for TRS,where (a) levels of molybdenum-containing proteins are increased through supplementation with sodium molybdate ; (b) levels of selenoproteins are increasedthrough supplementation with Se-methylselenocysteine ; © the activity of enzymes in the transsulfurationpathway is increased through supplementation with taurine, L-arginine, and L-citrulline ; (d) iron-sulfur proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)are increased through supplementation with iron from iron sulfate, coenzyme Q10, copper, pantothenic acid ,and acetyl-L-carnitine ; (e) enzymes involved in L-cysteinemetabolism and selenium metabolism are supportedby vitamin B6 ; and (f) increased protein synthesis is supported by supplementation with whey protein . Allthree dimensions of schizophrenia, positive symptoms,negative symptoms, and symptoms of disorganization,would be treated by the proposed treatment. I just want to add, so
me of these things are quite likely safe in ordinary amounts, like B-6 and whey protein, but ask your doctor because: Future clinical trials of the recommended supplements are the most appropriate way to investigate whether addressing dysregulations of the transsulfuration pathway and regulations of other pathways that can arise from dysregulations of the transsulfuration pathway can treat TRS You can definitely overdose on things like iron and copper."

174368830,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Exercise as a Treatment for Schizophrenia: A Review. SJ _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and ME _PERSON_, Psychopharmacology bulletin , Feb 2019 15 Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment in areas of attention, working memory, and executive functioning. Although no clear etiology of schizophrenia has been discovered, many factors have been identified that contribute to the development of the disease, such as neurotransmitter alterations, decreased synaptic plasticity, and diminished hippocampal volume. Historically, antipsychotic medications have targeted biochemical alterations in the brains of patients with schizophrenia but have been ineffective in alleviating cognitive and hippocampal deficits. Other modalities, such as exercise therapy, have been proposed as adjuvant or primary therapy options. Exercise therapy has been shown to improve positive and negative symptoms, quality of life, cognition, and hippocampal plasticity, and to increase 
hippocampal volume in the brains of patients with schizophrenia. This article will briefly review the clinical signs, symptoms and proposed etiologies of schizophrenia, and describe the current understanding of exercise programs as an effective treatment in patients with the disease.

Then when I was 16 my libido with medication was gone. Now I am 22 and AM ?????? for life because I am starting tot have intrests. It is like they violated me. I feel repulsed at the people that do this who cause others to become handicaped for life. It is not only my libido that is damaged. I only know that damage done is irriversible. And that IT is completly being denied it exists. Because a permanent los OR even temporary one of libido was not mentioned in the side effects of my medication(antipsychotica). There is no way to prosecute the people that did this tot me. And I did wonder if I was demi sexual before and I was fine with that. I was not as far to acknoledg

176105530,_AT_MENTION_ maybe that was over the top. I mean I just compared myself to the effing universe. I went down once as the office flirt.

But I usually come to my senses and leave quickly. I see people buying large amounts of alcohol every time I go to the store. Never understood how one can drink just one or two drinks and be satisfied."

176105562,"Hello everyone, it’s been a while!!! ^.^ Last I was on here I got psychotic again. My episode isn’t over yet but I’m on Geodon now and I hope to stay on it for the rest of my life since the remaining meds make it impossible for me to live a normal life. Lots to say but first of all my support groups decided to let me attend again so I had my first Women’s Group on Friday. My cousin from China is stuck in Hawaii due to coronavirus and we’ve been out taking ig photos a lot. Today I met up with one of the leaders of a new volunteer group I’m joining. It’s called Tzu Chi Buddhist group for super Chinese people. Sorry I can be so toxic after 3 years of therapy and day treatment programs but I’m committed to doing the right thing now. Next Saturday we are going to a nursing home to sing to and massage clients. My functioning isn’t too good but I’d really like to stick with it! It has ties to University of Hawaii at Manoa. Other things that happened to me include possibly getting a pup
py from a batch of mini labradors that were born recently. Pics forthcoming in March or April! I’d like to learn more about the lives of other Chinese immigrants to Hawaii through the volunteer group. The organizer I met today also moved to Hawaii during his childhood/teens and is around my age so I feel a connection to him. He comes from a strict mandarin speaking family from Guangzhou. Not sure how he lives because Chinese are all different culturally and I’d like to join the cause. Still a bit delusional but at least I can go out now. Here are a few photos I took recently! image3024×4032 4.69 MB image1440×1440 357 KB image4032×3024 1.86 MB image3006×2484 2.79 MB image4032×3024 3.45 MB Anyways my slightly delusional goal right now is to reform places like support group, clubhouse, and this forum to be more user friendly. How’ve you all been? Oh yeah, I quit therapy since I can’t find one yet that just lets me drink _USER_ID_, watch mukbang, and participate actively in the cause. And I am switch
ing to a less toxic pcp provider. Don’t want to break the rules by being more involved in the toxic mi environment than I can handle. So I’m curious if any of you are part of or interested in joining any societies or community activities like volunteering just 30 min- 1 hr per week or doing some small work for the community? Also _AT_MENTION_ how are you doing? Have you thought about doing a second club or activity in your spare time?"

She died by suicide unfortunately, she put rocks in her pockets and walked into a lake, prior to that she produced beautiful poetry…she experienced bouts of depression, she was known for her employment of the stream of consciousness i have never read any of her poetry, unfortunately for me, I’m neither keen on learning new things, nor at times able to have emotional experiences like normal healthy people do. That is my lif
e and I accept it. my symptoms make it so I can’t read and understand and really feel anything, I don’t mean to express that bitterly, or to be negativistic so this is a poem which is clearly about hypomania…and I find it amazing to think that there were persons who suffered with psychotic disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar long before modern medicine, who were able to describe in words, the way symptoms of these disorders feel, as there may not have been common precise words at that time to describe what they felt was going on so, to be able to read her poetry and the poetry of schizophrenics or other people with mental illness…that’s a tool but the literary approach can, I’d imagine, be valuable to those of us who feel we might gain a better understanding of our disease from that form of expression i feel at times that I am alone in my MI struggle…I’m sure reading poetry like this…it helps any _NAME_ fans here?"

176105577,Yeah I hope so. Where do u live? The states?

She has this kind of explosive character now, but she is a cool girl."
176105579,I despise this psych ward… they let u watch tv from 4-10pm and u can only go for smokes after 4 pm. From 6 am till 4pm u go for 3 smokes… o and there’s only 2 channels on the tv and u can’t have electronics… basically I just lay in my bed and stare at the ceiling… the only thing I like about this place is the food…my friend said jail is better cause u at least to get to see a fight or 2

176105585,"I’m not picking too much today. I just don’t feel like it. I think the NAC is helping already. I noticed a decrease in picking over the last couple days actually. Today I noticed that some wounds have already healed. I’m only taking 500 mgs right now and I’m supposed to increase it gradually to 1500 over the next 3 weeks. I don’t understand why it would work, but it seems to be. Maybe placebo? I’ll take it."
176105586,"But 800mg is considaring the weight of course, i couldn’t take the same as a fat men. I once took only 5mg of aripiprazol only. It was low for sure. Now i think i take medium/high"

176105594,"I met a guy through internet dating before. He seemed special and kind, but also had disabilities (autism, psychosis) just like me. In the first few sentences he proposed we would work through a book with questions about love and faith for a year. Im not afraid about commitment…but this seemed superfast. I said no to that. But we talked. After a few (deep) chats i expressed doubt. He was deeply hurt. Said he couldnt deal with rejection anymore, it is always like this. I said i wanted to think a bit. I said i didnt want to date. I need a slow progression, starting superficial and getting more attached slowly and carefully. I said i couldnt offer him what he needed, but he was a beautiful person. I used to throw myself into something. But i know this always worked out wrong. He started to insult me and say i shouldnt be dating if im not serious, i only rejected him because he didnt have a car or work, i was bad and unfair in all sorts of ways and unfit for dating. I wondered… What is normal in da
ting? It is normal to slowly build a connection and just be honest if things go too fast, or you have some doubts, no? Does this mean im unfit for dating? I dont want to date now. But in general."
176105595,Sisters totally can come! I love sisters!
176105596,"I often forget what I am doing or what I am going to do. Once I was at a wedding and I told my aunt where is your husband, she kinda got sad and mad and said he died. I completely forgot that he died eventhough I was at his funeral a couple months ago. I felt so bad and still feel bad when thinking about it. I recently turned 30 and already have memory problems. Is it from SZ cognitive symptoms? I can post here as its easy but in real life I suck and have serious issues."

176105598,"Ya, I know. I tend to think so what? I mean my thoughts are private and I don’t want them known because I have strange, delusional thoughts but that is about it. I don’t care if they see my fat body or me taking a crap lol. My thoughts are stupid, contradictory, and (r-word). I used to flip off the smoke alarms in the mental hospital but I think that would give me extremely bad luck. I have nightmares about it. Sick people… You know those TV shows like Supernatural and _NAME_ the Teenage Witch? Where they can see you through the mirror like a portal? Ya, I had thoughts come from mirrors and even the TV. I’m mostly over it and it doesn’t concern me or bother me at all. I just covered the TV with a blanket and the mirrors I either left alone or covered with paper. Not sure. You cannot really do much except take meds and see a doctor. I thought all or some of it was real. I mean I don’t want to get too involved or encourage delusions or go down a damn rabit hole. But I feel ya. I’ve seen 
some strange people on YouTube like people. I can relate to some. They start losing me when they start talking about shape shifting into animals and aliens and pink unicorns and crap lol. Crazy is what crazy does but there’s a limit to my craziness. I cannot entertain and believe all thoughts. My reality is different from theirs. Plus, I have my own unique story. I don’t want to pollute my thoughts or story with their garbage."
176105599,"No, not often 666/999"
176105600,I’m socially avoidant even with my family.
174368864,"Funny thing, don’t do this, I cut my pill in half and next day I had more energy, went out picking up my friend with my car, went shopping, having a coffee and then trained with heavy weights at home. Now after taking full dose I lost that energy. Back to staying in bed all day everyday, oh well… Only if I knew the second before psychosis hits…I would have taken my pill only when needed…nice dream"
176105601,"From my experience thought broadcasting started with thinking your thoughts are being monitored, so you didn’t have the privacy to think. Then your thoughts just pop out everywhere. Let your mind rest. Clear your mind and then your thoughts will come out at the appropriate time. Hope this helps."
174368868,"It is like a pay to play video game: everything is accessible to level 21-25~ then we have to pay money to continue playing the game with a lot of glitches from a mid game to late game that keeps crashing and bugging out, that a character needs go to a customer support for a solution and usually gets partially solved or non at all and it keeps bugging out until the end game."
176105602,Yes I’m on ziprasidone and setraline
176105603,Congratulations _AT_MENTION_ ! Hope you enjoy it!
176105604,Went better because my coworkers trained me a little bit. But when it was just me and one other lady she left me alone for a little bit and I was trying to find her because something was ordered that I didn’t know how to make. I just made what I thought would be right. She came back 10 minutes later smelling like weed. So frustrating. But overall I learned some things tonight. It’s very hard on me because I didn’t know who there was spying on me tonight. And I’m not used to the job yet. I’m struggling with some things so I hope I get it all right soon. I’m still feeling discouraged like I don’t know enough fast enough. I really want to quit due to the stress. It’s making me feel really paranoid about things.
176105606,Bad news again _AT_MENTION_ This makes me cry
176105607,Don’t like flying…or the dentist…
174368871,How did they respond?
176105608,This sounds uncanny like a certain hate crime that gets you banned if your say it!
176105609,I view the voices as a child who had their toy taken away because they were hitting people with it. Go with that step and tell yourself theyre the children im the adult.

176105611,Books are much preferable.
176105612,"I’ll say a bit more as an alcoholic she was quite aggressive. and now it is so unbelievable amount of caring my mum has done she is practically suicidal herself and now there is some change, mum is processing that she will speak to no one outside me and mum peers, doctors, health professionals - not a chance - not now or ever before my mum has spent about 24 years of primary live in carer of the 3 of us spent in psychosis one or 2 of us at a time"

176105615,I’ve sure had a few bad ones. The worst had such a thick Russian accent that I could barely understand him. Was tempted to check him for _PERSON_ tats – he looked gangsta AF!
174368865,"Certain things like nicotine and caffeine worsen DP/DR. Unfortunately, I’ve had both in excess amounts over the years. I probably have bipolar at the least and schizophrenia at the worst combined with Aspergers syndrome and some minor things like OCD and depression and anxiety. I just don’t understand why I have no motivation, cognitive decline, and stuff like that if I just have bipolar. I was normal before I got sick. I don’t hallucinate at all. I don’t see things or hear voices. But I have obsessive traits and stuff like that. Like I said, that’s common in DP/DR. I had severe negative symptoms which I initially thought was from the medication. But it could lead to schizophrenia. Most psychiatrists and mental health workers will diagnose you probably with something besides DP/DR based on my years of being a patient. It sucks. When I first tried to get help, they gave me a small amount of risperdal. I didn’t take it. Things eventually got worse. My first psychologist said there was som
ething in the energy drinks making me allergic or something, I had acute stress disorder, and that’s about it. He didn’t see _PERSON_’s in me. But I’m glad he caught and diagnosed me with acute stress disorder. He was a smart guy!"

174368869,"What do you do for work? What jobs have you enjoyed the most? I’ve never worked. Gonna be thirty in a couple of years time. I would like to be doing something more substantial with my life by then. The problem is I’m not qualified in anything and I really don’t have an interest to do most menial jobs. It seems really daunting and I have no idea how Im going to navigate employment. Other than writing music, and some gaming, I just find most things really boring and pointless. I think about suicide a lot when I look at my future, and I’ve been stuck in this void since I was diagnosed some 12 years ago. I don’t often feel compelled to act on it. Its more just frustration at society."
176105618,"Gosh, I try to speak for myself here and thus not get involved in a misjudgment for our shared experiences. My room, too, is a mess. I haven’t found my transit card in a few days."
176105619,"I stopped writing for years because of the voices disturbing my mind. It was difficult to even read. Fortunately, after about a decade of taking meds, the voices have been reduced to about 8% now. So I tried to get my hands back to writing. If you’re interested, here’s an introduction to my writing: _NAME_ is a teenager with psychiatric problems. He has been through trauma that has changed everything about him. Little does he know that this is only the beginning of the tragedy. He discovers that the auditory hallucinations he has been experiencing are turning into actual thoughts of what people are thinking. He is “The Thoughts Listener”. And a link to the first chapter.

176105620,You sound well _AT_MENTION_-Cotton . Nice to see the other side of you .
176105621,I have almost two weeks of sick leave at work and I go to a lot of appointments. I have only been at my job since April so we aren’t really allowed to take.leave because I am in training and on probation the first year. You don’t have any sick leave? I am supposed to have a 104 hours of disabled veteran leave but they didn’t give it to me yet. I put in a request. Our HR is slow.
176105622,"Ahh I see. Well, it’s ultimately up to you whether to agree to a med change. Most of the people on here who have tried both adderal and antipsychotics had a bad time, but I think it worked out for one or two."
176105623,"I am going to be on my meds for the rest of my life while I work full-time, 5 days a week. If I were to not take my meds, I don’t think I’d be stable enough to continue with employment."
176105624,"For me, agitation is a sure sign of a mixed episode. I get so agitated I pace around and talk to myself and feel aggressive. These are things that are totally our of character for me so it’s scary. Mixed episodes are the worst of the worst for me."
174368878,"Did you movements robotic like this girl in the video? Mine like this. I never had full freezing even for 5 seconds. Mine is partial freezing like this girl in the video. When walking hands get still, face gets still and it appear like robotic walking. Forget to even blink eyes."
176105625,"Off meds, I am definitely more violence prone than your average, neurotypical, older female. But while on meds, I’m as gentle as a newborn lamb. And that’s why I always take my meds religiously."
176105626,"I, too, knew a guy named _PERSON_. He used to swing his pelvis and make a hissing noice, his idea of a mating call. He also was a good runner."
176105627,"I don’t know sometimes I have confidence, and other times I feel like I’m an alien. I just hope that they understand I don’t mean any harm."
176105628,"I am scared that mine will find fault with me. Our carpet is a mess, but we’ve lived here for 9 1/2 years with the same carpet, so I figure it’s normal to have a few stains. A couple of years ago, they re-did the upstairs bathroom because of a leak. The new tub wall looks like it is separating from the wall a bit because there is a crack all the way around it. Then, where the tub wall meets the tub, I don’t think it was sealed correctly because water runs through that crack and down the wall. It’s created cracks in the drywall. I don’t want them to think it is our fault, so I haven’t said anything. I need to clean the house, then suck it up and tell them so they can come look at it. Anyhow, my point is that you aren’t alone."
176105629,"I forgot to mention, it’s a real bad idea to mix a fast acting benzo like ativan with alcohol. You will most likely blackout. It happened to me once and I only had two beers. Got to spend 15 days in jail after I hit a pole. 15 days with no meds at all. I learned a life lesson."

176105631,I’ve had an allergic reaction to my depot. This is the 3rs time it’s happened now. It’s red and very swollen. I saw the doctor today. Initially a few months ago they thought it was an infection but he said it’s looking more like an allergic reaction. My nurse and psychiatrist has been informed. But I’ve yet to hear back. Do you think I will have to switch medication ?
176105632,New York will probably be next
174368884,No problem. I have paranoid schizophrenia. I am dealt with all of these kinds of delusions. To key to defeat any paranoid hallucination or delusion is to look to the evidence. Feel free to ask me anything if you need further explanation.

176105638,"okay, I’m gonna reply. When I was hearing voices, after eating lunch, they calmed down, and I felt like I was feeding them and they were happy. but that didn’t last long. They sure seem like real people. just work with your care team to get rid of 'em."

176105655,"I think the injection is a placebo and they are tricking me, and I’m NOT paranoid. Once you’ve been labelled paranoid they don’t listen to your concerns, i.e like the depot nurse today while I was telling him I think its a placebo, he looked like he was thinking ‘’‘paranoid’’…"

176105658,"Because it isn’t really all that usual. I like that more than Socrates’ quote about never returning an injustice to someone no matter how much we suffer from them. They’re both beautiful, but this one hits the mark better."

176105660,"Cool, glad you are in a good place. Feel better!"
176105661,Unsuccessful. I applied to more warehouses today. I think since I’m only available 12-15 hours per week it’s making it tough to even get a part time job. My mom is sending me a little money to help out thankfully. I didn’t ask for it either. So it’s extra generous. I guess I’ll wait and see.
176105662,Nihilism much? wlw

176105664,i wouldnt just keep it to yourself it will only make the delusion more real over time. Try to talk about it with some people so they can give you some grounding feedback. Its good to get it out of your mind…
176105665,Throwing up the meds seems to be the problem. If you’re not able to take the meds then you’ll probably be depressed. I hope they can sort it out for you.
176105666,"To be fair, I did go to nursing school and have also worked for a dermatologist. But no, I’m not a doctor."

176105686,Have not seen you around for a while. How are you tukey? In a partner I am happy with my boyfriend. I used to think that sex was not important and that I can go without sex with a really good partner but I changed my mind. I want a partner that will go down on me and kiss me on the mouth often too. Someone romantic and that compliments me and loves me and treats me well. Someone fit never used to matter to me but now I have a fit boyfriend I changed my mind. Someone who will marry me and wants to marry me. Rather my partner doesn’t smoke or do drugs. I rather a faithful partner who is affectionate and funny. My partner doesn’t have to be super funny but I’m happy if we can laugh together. I’m more picky since I met my boyfriend because he is better than I dreamt of.

174368909,You sound like you have negative symptoms working against you _AT_MENTION_ . They can make you tired and not motivated very well. They are either from the meds or from the illness. I have voices in my mind that make it so hard to be determined not to quit. They are constantly nagging. But lately i have been working on the weekends for a couple hours. I can so I want to. It sounds like you are doing a good job so maybe don’t quit. You possibly can work out things as the come up. Processing and stuff. You don’t have to talk much unless you have a service job.

174368917,"Well not according to the VA. You can only be rated for one mental health disorder. I am 100% disabled for paranoid schizophrenia. And the VA doesn’t consider a personality disorder a disability at all so I am glad I didn’t get diagnosed with one of those. I tried to claim depression and anxiety too but only the schizophrenia I have a diagnosis and a rating for. If you are not a veteran in the US though I guess it doesn’t really matter. I take antidepressants and anxiety medication also. I also take Latuda because it helps with negatives. I think when you say you have depression with schizophrenia it’s more likely negative symptoms and not really depression. I am lucky because Wellbutrin and Latuda help me but my anhedonia and flat affect are still strong. I also take Xanax for my anxiety and paranoia. If you are diagnosed with what you take meds for then I guess I have schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety also but schizophrenia is my only mental health diagnosis in my medical records. I 
also have insomnia and sleep apnea."

It took a good 6 months before they were completely gone, and I didn’t feel them go away partially until about 3 months from my last shot. I really recommend taking the pill form instead, unless you’re not med compliant and therefore need some sort of court ordered injection. The half life of pills is a lot shorter which is good in case you ever need to come off it."

Also as a warning, I read smoking reduces antipsychotics effectiveness by 30-50% from smoking chemicals but not from nicotine. Vaping and nicotine replacement therapies don’t affect antipsychotics effectiveness. (Wikipedia Schizophrenia) I guess I will rely on strong coffee until my nicotine ejuice comes in the mail. “Tobacco smoking increases the 
metabolism of some antipsychotics, by strongly activitating CYP1A2 the enzyme that breaks them down, and a significant difference is found in these levels between smokers and non-smokers. It is recommended that the dosage for those smokers on clozapine be increased by 50%, and for those on olanzapine by 30%.” en.wikipedia.org Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by relapsing episodes of psychosis.

174368922,"https://www.medwirenews.com/mental-health/psychotic-disorders/glycine-and-homocysteine-levels-linked-to-schizophrenia/168084 They hypothesized that altered glycine and homocysteine levels may contribute to N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor dysfunction and thereby influence the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Plasma glycine levels were significantly lower in the patients with schizophrenia than in controls, with values in male and female patients being 15.0% and 14.3% lower than healthy men and women, respectively. A difference in the ratio of glycine to serine between patients and controls was also highly robust. In contrast to these low glycine levels, patients with schizophrenia also had high levels of homocysteine, which were higher overall for men than for women. Indeed, homocysteine levels in male schizophrenia patients were 65% higher than in healthy males, while female patients had levels that were 25% higher than those of control women.

You don’t even have to do paid work to achieve this. Volunteering may be a good stepping stone to something better.

176105935,"Hello I’m new to this forum , I wanted to make my first post on some matters I need advice with. Maybe someone relates? So for a good bit of my life I have struggled with delusions, although I didn’t come to realize this until recently. I used to whole heartedly believe things like that other could read my mind, government was watching me because I wasnt human, I thought I was a “shifter” or various other things. Since I would experience weird sensations and my sense of smell is more sensitive so that sort of helped me “rationalize” my beliefs of being not human. Now I know I am, but back then I didn’t. Of course I still struggle with the thinking but I try and keep an eye on my thoughts. I stopped believing in alot of stuff once my sister had a psychotic break that was induced by her drug use - this kinda shocked me to reality for awhile, but I still struggle just not as much. My sister and I used to believe alot of the same stuff, and we would talk alot or “share information”…
but once she had the episode that scared even me, i couldn’t talk to her and that seemed to help me alittle Recently I’ve been feeling weird sensations, from feeling water dripping on my skin or a pool of water/liquid on my head. To more “sexual” sensations (although I still believe the sexual ones have external sources and they don’t cause me any sort of distress). For example, this seems to happen mostly when I’m in my bed. I’ll feel touches (very light, sometimes it’s just pressure that feels like skin against mine, or warmth/vibrations) on my chest, groin, stomach, etc. I’ll also feel “weight” on the bed with me, usually to the side or on me directly. Like someone/something is with me. It’s hard to describe but I mostly seem to feel the touches through the blankets or my mattress/pillow. If I’m moving around or not in bed, I don’t feel them/her. If I am in bed, I’ll immediately feel them/her with me. (There’s also a bit of a presence to her/them). To try and better explain 
the sensations, I’ll feel like the blankets on my bed are moving (like micro movements) to “her” movements, and it’s like through the blankets she’ll touch me or something. When the blankets are on me, there will be areas where there’s more pressure and the blankets/her will radiate warmth and the softeness/texture you’d feel of human skin…then I’ll feel the vibrations/etc that will sorta “arouse” me. It doesn’t usually bother me but sometimes does, especially when I’m trying to sleep I’ll feel “her” presence with me alot of the day, no matter where I am. However I don’t feel the actual touches/etc Unless I’m in bed…(only rarely will I feel a touch outside of my bed) for the most part, her presence to me is very comforting/loving. Never aggressive I didn’t start feeling the touches, presence/etc until about a year ago. Before then it was mostly just my beliefs and other things. However I wanted to know if anyone experiences anything like this? Advice?"

Dance is something i love, but it terrifies me too, cause it combines all the above fears. Now i just started a much higher course in tango last week. All is new - even a new dance partner i didnt know. I was SO scared, but proud. Despite the fear i started to enjoy it last week. I even loved to be physically close to this guy, strangely. Strangers scare me normally, i hate them touching me. I think he is sweet and cute and odd in a way i like. He is probably at least 5 years my junior. But i felt a bit flirty. I was very shy, insecure and awkward. Im 37 and felt like a teen. He is single. But i cant possibly flirt with him. So…now…help! Now what? I have to dance with this guy for at least 10 or 12 more weeks. Im confused and feel weird about it, and a bit excited too."

I also wasn’t having them before I went on Abilify so I have some retrospect. I started Abilify because I was having problems with addiction and I wanted to become stable. The Strattera has been a miracle. I don’t want to go on anything else because it stopped me from craving drugs and has kept me clean for over a year. But the headaches really are annoying.

I dont think it comes down to really being an antipsychotic I think it comes down to just normalizing the brain. With CBD I just feel normal. I do not feel numbed or slowed I just feel like it makes me normal but I can tell I need a higher dose. It allows me to perceive depth better like I did before I was diagnosed.

I might be a victim but I believe in forgiveness and deliverence? and an afterlife. I had my former female psychiatrist say to be an engineer or programmer and to stay away from math and physics (she said my IQ was 110 based off my vocabulary and mannerisms), and then my current psychiatrist said I would make a good mid-tier college math professor (which made me feel great). What I gathered from that is I wouldn’t be a Harvard math professor or something but I could be a community college math professor or even an average state school math professo
r at your average state school (No UCs though lol). But my reputation is tarnished and it’s not all my fault. Like I said, I believe in forgiveness, and deliverence. I hope to achieve peace and happiness some day."

She may be causing you a lot of trouble and grief but you will probably miss her when she’s gone and boy, our parents are gone way too soon. Me and my parents fought all the time when I was a kid and a teenager. I got along great with my parents after I became an adult. It’s easy to take parents for granted and not appreciate them for what they have done for you. Parents don’t know everything and lots of times she is just muddling through life just like you or me and she doesn’t always know what she’s doing but she’s probably doing the best that she can. OK, now you can go back to hating her."

174368984,"Hi all, Do I have schizophrenia? That is a question I struggle with. Doctors say yes, but I feel they are not really following the diagnostic criteria or even common sense. Not that I am an expert on diagnosis. Indeed, that is why I’m here posting and looking for help. I would agree I am on a schizophrenia spectrum, where schizoid personality disorder (SPD) may be the mildest and hebephrenic schizophrenia the most serious. I’ve been active on SPD forums, and I kind of fit in there. Meanwhile, despite my _PERSON_’s diagnosis, I don’t seem to find in on Aspie forums. There was a time where I believed I might have the “simple” schizophrenia variant, which is like the negative symptoms in the absence of positive ones. However, I’ve since come to understand that schizophrenia is a particularly serious mental disorder, That is perhaps the major reason why I question my schizophrenia diagnosis. I had an episode of auditory hallucinations, but that is more than 10 years ago now. It resembled 
paranoid schizophrenia, but it did not last long enough to meet diagnostic criteria. It is not apparent any more that I have a personality disorder, but I still have a schizoid personality type/style. I don’t feel lonely, and I spend most of my time on solitary acitivites. I am anhedonic, and notably apathetic. On the other hand, I really enjoy socialising with the right people, and I prefer this over the solitary activities. I also have residual depression. I got burnt out (“exhaustion depression”) in 1999, and my symptoms since took on a more typical form of depression. I am bipolar, and had my first obvious (hypo)manic episode in 2007. I feel my negative symptoms are best accounted for by the schizoid PD and the bipolar depression. Meanwhile, the positive symptoms, ie. delusions, have a lot to do with impulsive and uncritical thinking that comes along with (hypo)mania. Sometimes I have funny ideas and beliefs, but it is not clear that I have enough conviction in them in order to qualify them as “de
lusions”. I am not rigid about them, and I’m willing to talk about them and consider alternative interpretations. I have had a number of unusual, largely spiritual, experiences. Maybe at times I have a touch of schizotypal personality disorder. Eg. I have experienced time travel, but only once, and only a few seconds back in time. I have been in a parallel reality (or universe?) on at least two occasions (meanwhile, it seems my body was at the same time in the ordinary reality, but I was not aware of it, and my best guess is that my alter personalities or subconscious were controlling it. These experiences were so real that they cannot have been any kind of ordinary dreams or hallucinations. I mentioned alter personalities. I have dissociative identity disorder (DID) or at least dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS). I lose time, have memory gaps, go unconscious, while some other personality takes over the body. This happens rarely, generally less than yearly. I cannot hear their voices. I 
have other dissociative symptoms such as depersonalisation and derealisation. Nothing feels fully real, it’s a bit like I am in a room in my mind watching my life unfold as if on a screen like a movie. There’s a bit of a “schizm” between my doing and my observing selves. Often, it’s as if I am on auto-pilot; I walk a lot, and most of the time I’m inside my mind and I’m not fully aware of my surroundings, and afterwards, I remember it only as a blur or as a few fragments that come to mind. I cannot describe what happened during a walk (or many other activities) in any kind of detail, but I’m usually aware of the route I took, in sketchy terms but I can’t say what happened, what I saw or heard, throughout that time. I would not be able to estimate how much time it took, but I use a stopwatch. I have had pretty serious social phobia/anxiety. For some reason, especially after the “paranoid schizophrenic” episode in 2009 that I mentioned above, this social phobia has been diminishing. As a ma
tter of fact, after my psychosis, my personality has been evolving so much that I’m a whole other person. I was a kind of a materialist and a geek into computers and neuroscience, and since then, I’ve become a very spiritual and optimistic being, in spite of the depression. Lately, especially after starting a tricyclic antidepressant, I’ve have become less “psychotic-like”. Eg. I think more critically and/or soberly about my experiences and beliefs. During the same period, I have also become less depressed, to the point that I cannot say I have a “mood” disorder any more, because there’s nothing wrong with my mood. So, what do you think? Any questions I should ask myself to decide “how schizophrenic” I am? I guess schizophrenia is just a name, a label, and my life and things will be the same whether or not this label is applicable to me. That said, some people take this label seriously, and eg. prescribe different medications based on it. I feel a diagnosis of schizophrenia serves to distr
act from my more distressing symptoms, because most people hearing about schizophrenia obsess about the positive symptoms of the disorder, especially the voices. If the average person (or doctor) were to learn I’m schizophrenic, they would assume I’m hearing voices or believe in aliens and conspiracies and things like that. _PERSON_, _NAME_."

176106125,Yep. Decided that I’m gonna be honest to myself and admit that I hate my job and I wanna leave. I shouldn’t have to put up with things anymore. Not wanting to work somewhere anymore is not the same thing as refusing to take responsibility and support yourself. I finally don’t hold guilt to my emotions and for that I’m happy. Don’t know how quickly things are gonna start moving for me but I only see my bags being packed and on my plane ride to my destination of choice. I don’t hold any regrets but I don’t owe anyone anything either. Feels good to finally say that and be free.

Disabuse yourself of the notion that “being in love makes everything good.” I hope you live in a culture where you have a choice about who may be your partner.

For example, when I’m in the shower they will ask me how many times I’ve showered until I start to believe that I’ve spent hours just getting in and out of the shower. Sometimes angrily responding to them helps me. It was my therapist suggestions but with your voices I may talk to a Dr. about it before I try."

176106153,Do normal people have to force themselves to get dressed and go out - even to nice places like flea market? To paint and write? To work? To clean the house? To brush their teeth? To pray? To have sex? To socialise? Or is it just mentally ill who struggle with this? I wanted to go to flea market today. It was a lovely sunny day and it was calling me to go out. And I wanted a teal turban cap. But I struggled to get going. Its like i was paralysed mentally or something. I had to force myself to get to my cupboard and get dressed. But eventually I did go - and I got that teal cap. I’m wearing it right now Why oh why do I have to struggle even with basic things normal people take for granted??

176106166,"The above assumes 100% bioavailability (100% of the dose gets into your system). If the bioavailability of your drug is for example 60%, 60% of the dose gets into your system, and in 1 half-life the amount will be reduced to 30%. When you take another dose, multiply it by the bioavailability (0.6 in this example), and add the resulting value to the amount that is left from taking the drug previously. Using the 60% bioavailability as an example, if you take 100mg initially: 100mg*0.6 = 60mg gets into your system. After 1 half life has passed 60mg/2 = 30mg is left in your system. If you now take another dose, 30mg + 60% of 100mg (another dose) = 90mg of drug is in your system."

176106171,I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. Do you have a psych doctor? Maybe they could help you with the ups and downs you’re going through. I know that without my doc and meds my emotions are all over the place too.

176106173,why?
176106174,"I’m sorry that happened to you, _AT_MENTION_ . My dad used to beat my sister pretty badly. My family was an angry family. It’s hard when you’ve suffered injustice as a child. It’s hard not to feel upset every time you think of it."

176106178,yea it could be the illness. you can start to feel really numb and maybe the music also starts to sound empty then… maybe not enough dopamine? But it’s good that you will talk about it with your doc. I hope they find something for it…

176106191,I had a brain MRI many years ago. It was normal. But I don’t have a copy of the report to read you the verbiage. They did it because they were looking for signs of MS.
176106192,I like _NAME_ because he is taking on these pharma giants and is going to reduce the profit motive for these companies. Having a public healthcare system will eliminate the motive to manipulate markets for drugs and supplements.
176106193,"Theres quite a few people that ACTUALLY DO hate me in this town. Ive seen the scornful looks by drunken bints i used to associate with in a bar. Even been told “im not right in the head”.

176106194,"I drink ok on my meds, but weed was a big no no for me, it triggers my voices extremely bad and make me feel so weird to the point I hated it.

176106195,funny
176106196,"Only as an anger response to abusers. When I got away from the people abusing me, the thoughts faded then disappeared completely with time. I’m sorry you’re having a hard time. It was always scary and unsettling for me. I hope you are able to become free of homicidal thoughts. I can only suggest that you speak with your mental health team if you haven’t already. Until then, maybe you can distract yourself from those voices and feelings with something calming like having tea or watching a lighthearted film. I know it’s not a fix but mindless distraction can sometimes do the mind good. Best of luck _AT_MENTION_"

176106201,"Can this med kill one day my anxiety and my paranoia in fact? I pay many efforts now, cause on me, the meds dont work very well, but i wonder why i still experience fears from the others? Can this med help this one day? Ive tried all the other 12 aps, none of them didnt kill my fears… I wonder if i went quite dumb on the zyprexa too? Cause i find that the dumbness and the low from the med is a good terrain for fears, no? … My pdoc was saying, that this med can work in my case on years, not in months on my fears, but it seems as a lie to me … But maybe slowly by slowly it will function on the paranoia? Isit good for paranoia the zyprexa precisely? gosh… i am pissed of being scared… Hugs"
176106202,"If you’re not well right now, Church is the last place you need to be."
174369025,I wonder if this treatment works after the damage has been done? Like would it would it work after having schizophrenia? Maybe its a preventive treatment. I don’t think you can create synapses after they’re gone.
176106203,I was on a monthly injection recommended by my then nurse practitioner. Suffice to say i’m off it now.
176106204,I’m so confused on whether this is a degenerative disorder or not
176106205,Still those decisions should be made by a doctor.
176106206,Thanks for the honest advice guys

176106208,"Not my family, not my friends, not my peers. In fact, many people don’t seem to be interested in me at all unless they need something. As of 12:11AM central time (Chicago, USA), it’s been one month, 2 days, 21 hours and 57 minutes since the hospice nurse found him dead. No one, and I mean no one, asks how I’m doing about it. And I’m not asking for the world, here; I don’t know any psychics; but once, just once, I’d like to know that someone was thinking about my well being on their very own, without my goddamn help. He’s gone. He’s really gone. I sometimes beg God to send him back. I beg him to come back. I figure, if God is truly omnipotent, then it’s possible I’ll wake up one morning and he’ll be here. It’s just a tiny little hope that I’ll have to abandon if I’m ever going to move on, but I’m not ready to let go. I truly thought I was, but I was wrong. I still feel like there’s a chance that he’ll return, healthy, and things will go back to the way they were…

176106213,"Yes, over an extended period of time. I’m feeling so much better taking my meds though, they really help stabilize me."
176106214,"_AT_MENTION_ I hope I end up growing out of it, I’m glad you did."
176106215,Voices sometimes scream “die” but it’s not why I wanna die. It’s a deep feeling of hopelessness
176106216,Not “understanding” other people’s delusions is probably what being smart is all about. _NAME_ would have agreed with you.
176106217,Yeah mine say there the watchers to and say it’s all fake to made by their minds

176106229,"I’ve found being on here the last several hours quite therapeutic, actually. It’s been a while since I’ve done something like this here.

176106232,I had that too. Still do really but after so many years you just get used to it. It doesn’t even bother me anymore.
176106233,Its for depression. Do you have depression?

176106236,so they r terrible negative things so its a mental illness
176106237,I sleep all day if I don’t drink coffee while on Risperdal. I wasn’t drinking coffee while on Latuda. I would rather drink coffee than having bad nausea and akathisia preventing me from sleeping.

I have that to, my voices want to worst for me and always want me to be negative… They tell me im a demon and there is no way i will go to heaven. I just try to tell myself its not real, that its just an illness, maybe it is i dont know. Whats more probable it being an illness or spirits from another dimension. Id say the illness is i think…"

She was diagnosed towards the end and given an antipsychotic but she was taking these before the antipsychotic and I think until the end. She was taking them for a month if I remember correctly which I don’t and she just passed away a couple days ago, she also had COPD. The medical examiner rules cause of death as COPD but my cousin mentioned these pills and I started thinking about it. I didn’t even think about her COPD I just wanted her to have relief from the voices. Does anyone know if these pills have side effects that cause issues with breathing??? I can’t find anything on it."

176106270,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Mental illness in Disney animated films. A _NAME_ and G Fouts, Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie , May 2004 To examine the prevalence of verbalizations about mental illness in the animated feature films of The Walt Disney Company (TWDC). We discuss the results within the context of children's repeated exposure to popular animated movies and their learning of labels and stereotypes associated with mental illness. We recommend further research on this topic.We coded 34 animated feature films produced by TWDC for mental illness references (for example, ""crazy"" or ""nuts""). We developed a coding manual to systematize the content analysis, to ensure accuracy of the data, and to ascertain intercoder reliability.Most of the films (that is, 85%) contain verbal references to mental illness, with an average of 4.6 references per film. The references were mainly used to set apart and denigrate the characters to whom they referred. Twenty-one percent of the pri
ncipal characters were referred to as mentally ill. We discuss the contributions and limitations of the study.The findings have implications for child viewers in terms of their potentially learning prejudicial attitudes and distancing behaviours toward individuals perceived as being mentally ill. To further verify this connection, an assessment of the incidence of Disney film exposure and attitudes toward people with a mental illness, using a sample of school-aged children, is needed. Did you learn prejudicial attitudes and distancing behaviours toward individuals perceived as being mentally ill in Disney movies? Yes No I can’t remember Please Disney don’t buy Lord of the Rings 0 voters"

176106327,"So I started my trial shifts at new work as _PERSON_’s assistant and then I’m being trained to be one. I have to help make teas, shakes and frappes. Also I make caco drink and some minor paintings on coffee with syrup. I also wash dishes and serve customers to their tables, pick up leftovers and clean the tables. As for closing I have to wash a dishwasher and it’s parts, hang towels to dry, clean kitchen tops and some parts of coffee machine. One drawback was today that I had a minor panic attack from top much coffee and my hands were shaking while I was bringing cups of coffee to a table. There was once accident today as co-worker made some coffee into a small cup and I tried to drink with one hand and my hand was shaking so badly that I spilt some and there was awkward silence. I did not talk much today, cause of panic attack. I asked for a cigarette break later on when I was getting alright. Cigarette really helped a lot to unwind. I managed to finish 11hrs shift and closed as well. I’m 
not sure if I should take artane for shaking hands, or quitting caffeine would help, but I’m working at a cafe!!! I also had only 30 mins break. I was standing the whole day, so my back hurts a bit cause I have some extra weight. I am polite with customers, I always say thank you, you’re welcome and say goodbye when the are leaving. I really want to maintain this job, I hope my employer doesn’t get tired of my shaking and being too silent at work. I barely use phone at work, only to reply a message every couple of hours and only then I am doing it privately. I am also not smiling that much, so kinda have poker face at work, but I voice tone is welcoming. Now I have 2 days off to rest and I’ll be coming in on Saturday. I haven’t done everything they said, but I’ve done the essential tasks given. I also serve croissants, cakes and other pastries. The biggest obstacle like said is the shaking hands, sometimes everyone can hear a cup clinging while I carry it, then I get embarrassed. But I haven’t g
iven up and not planning, I just had too much coffee and panicked a bit, but continued working. I haven’t sat down almost for a whole day, only for like 10 mins, but that’s not new to me, I was used to it. I can’t remember all recipes, but I also try to give the barista a plate for coffee and pour some milk into a frothing cup. I also started to froth and is going alright. They are currently not paying for the job, as I am volunteering right now and they want to see how I’ll do for one month and then they’ll decode to employ me or not. I can see that some baristas are worried for my hand shaking but I say it’s from medication and anxiety boosts it. It is really hard, it’s my first try after a relapse and I don’t want to lose this chance. It is not as hard as my last job, there is sometimes so time to talk and lean for a bit, but I always keep myself busy. I would like to have additional smoke break before my break, but I don’t want to bother my co-workers to ask for one, even tho I smoke in 
4min. I also often check the tables, refill sugar and correct the chairs."

174369060,"I don’t think I have this but the odds would be in my favor for this condition. I’m not sure how having both would work or even having _PERSON_’s on top of it. I wasn’t abused as a kid and had a somewhat normal life until college in 2011 when I believe I was in MK-Ultra-- Monarch or Montauk Project. Both are traumatic enough but it doesn’t really matter – I believe something like this happened and I cracked and ended up with dissociation called DP/DR and schizo-affective disorder – depressive type. I think it was the US Army, but not sure why they targeted me…I guess I was targeted as an American Citizen. I thought it was aliens too or was or still was at one time. When I sleep, I get thoughts of “dissociative amnesia” – something I looked up. Doctor will only diagnosis me with SZA and Aspergers, nothing else. Refuses to accept trauma and PTSD and stuff from my life during college around 2010-2013. My other personality is like _NAME_ but I don’t know. Could be fake or wrong. 
I just convinced myself I was him. Obviously, learning about myself is important and education is key, but nobody wants this stuff at all. It’s horrifying. I’ve felt like I’ve had only 2 personalities – _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ type (mainly thoughts from research and past lives). The nice guy and then the angry, self-destructive, stupid guy from the anger and hurt over the years and from rejection and denial from trying to get help. I keep the angry guy in check with meds and support and therapy and for other reasons. But I got thousands or millions of past lives from parallel universes – memories that are like from personalities leaking in from parallel universes…weird, strange, ????, huh? All according to many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. I just want to be left alone and live till I’m 90 or 100… There’s really no help for people like me. That’s why I come to this forum to chat and get some therapy because nothing else works for me. This website is great sometimes! I just find it all 
odd because I believe in the Illuminati, aliens, and believe time travel was involved. I get super soldier thoughts too. It’s like being an alien, trans-humanist Manchurian candidate but with time travel involved (forwards and backwards in time), consciousness/soul transfer, mind uploading, and memory loss. Stuff like that. I got paranoia, disability, etc. I feel like my life was ruined and destroyed like the “power elites” or people in control of time travel changed my past and put a micro-chip in my head when I was a child and took my sentience away. Not sure if Freemasons or US Army, but these are just random thoughts I have been getting. Not every thought is important or good to talk about, but it’s how I’ve been feeling for pretty much eternity. The feeling of quasi immortality and looping back in time is all to real. I always have insanity along with it. It’s a never ending race to try and get fixed of psychosis and live a meaningful and positive life. To be productive and happy. I cannot re
member my life before August 27th 2011 (21ish years old). I have the scars and stuff from growing up and remember them so maybe I’m not a clone…unless they got me young…but I keep coming back alive in a time loop/causal loop after that date as a schizophrenic. According to time travel lore, nothing changes before you come back, only after. Makes sense. My mind and brain was fractured in two parts. Part of me wants to get help, get my story out, and get the other part of my mind healed and uncovered. To remember the trauma and what they did to me. I think I was severely tortured and then released back into society. I just want to know the truth. Do I even have schizophrenia? Because I don’t hallucinate or hear voices? I have no motivation and I do have irrational and bizarre/unusual thoughts. I have IQ loss too. I wouldn’t even be saying this stuff if it didn’t happen, but it did happen, and it always (did) happen. I mean my past never changes so these people responsible for doing this to me are no
t only complete psychopaths to do this to a human being, but never stop, and always get away with it. In the grand scheme of things I don’t matter. I’m just a number and a statistic. I sometimes don’t even know if I’m from this planet or world sometimes. That’s how it feels. I even have thoughts of Mars and the Secret Space Program and stuff. I’ve talked about all this stuff before. Money, benefits, and stuff would be nice, but we all know I don’t want it, it ain’t going to happen, and it’s not a good idea to even entertain such ideas. I need to learn to let go better and more. Most people ‘involved’ in SSP/Super Soldier stuff don’t get money and know that. They want it though. They want recognition and help. It’s basically slavery. My life is okay right now. I’m doing good. Hope to continue to enjoy life for what I have going on right now.

176106466,"Most of my days are peaceful. I remember years back i thought i am better be dead, but its in the past. Glad i don’t live in a major city. Far to fast to catch a thought. I love daydreaming in my time and pace. Hopefully nobody starts hating me for living a good life."
176106467,CPM is counts per minute. Normal amount would be around 30 as the highest for background radiation on a geiger counter. RF Meter is used to see the watts from radio frequencies I get spikes of 34 V/m2 or more even when I’m out in the fields away from homes and people. These sort of readings strengthen my delusional thinking.
176106468,I’m not trying to escape
176106469,"No. It’s liberating. If it’s getting mundane then you need to change it up. Best thing I ever invested in was a fitness tracker. A cheap fitbit. I got out of a funk and started walking 10,000 steps a day. That is a good first goal for people unfit and walking fast as you can is a good start. Even walking briskly for 30 minutes, 3 times a week is good for the heart and health. I wish I was this motivated in my 30’s. I was rubbish and I should have been doing more exercise then. I’m now 49 and I’m way fitter and better off than I was smoking cigarettes and doing nothing at 30. If gym is like jail your doing it all wrong and for the wrong reasons."
176106470,That’s how my colds start.
176106471,No it’s not really racing thoughts it’s like my brain hits that gas button for a second by mistake and thoughts come out that are kinda related to what I was just thinking but sometimes they make no sense like I’m playing a video game and I’m thinking wow I’m good and I look at a spatula and I think something like queezy ex
176106472,Has anyone ever felt like they have been manipulated by someone to the point where they started having symptoms? Because some people can be very manipulative by the way they talk or the way they look at them. I was just wondering if anyone has gone through this. It’s almost to the point where they will play mind games until you start having symptoms.
176106473,"I remember myself at 10 believing that God had created only me and other beings were robots, soulless entities, without inner experience and inner world, just to test my reactions towards them."
176106474,I know that feel. Its weird that i havent gotten that feeling in quite a while. Probably the meds doing their work. Pretty sure its a delusion though. Itll pass at some point
176106475,"Yeah, I have those every now and then."
176106476,"I’m afraid to go back to college (a local one) due to my inability to sustain drive and finish. I also am afraid of failing. It’s a huge thing of mine. I don’t even want to try sometimes. I want to major in math but I cannot think anymore. I think engineering is better for me because I want to work with my hands and even build/invent things and make a ton of money. I want to start a company/corporation, but these things are unrealistic. I don’t even want to try. I rather just do coursera and _PERSON_. I feel like a major failure. I cannot even wash myself and brush my teeth. My mood swings are rapid and extreme. I think I have schizo-affective disorder but I don’t want to acccept and admit it. I don’t like competing anymore. I take the wise words of _NAME_ who says competition is for losers. I agree now. I used to love competition but I think teamwork is better. I felt better at community college because of the support and teamwork. At university, I was alone and felt like everyone was 
backstabbers."
176106477,"I was in a mental care home in India for 4 months. There was no running water for the first 2 months, no proper toilets,no internet, no computers and no staff who spoke English. I spent most of my time there speaking with a couple patients there who understood english and also by reading epubs on my smartphone."
176106478,"And when they checked on her, she was in shock over a rerun of Home Makeover."
176106479,I called the Rite Aid I used to go to before I moved because I knew they were open. Their website probably can help you find a location that’s open today
176106480,Yeah I miss being super smart and able to juggle 6 college level classes with a B+ or higher in each one and still find time to game and socialize. 7 years ago I wasn’t hearing voices and I was very clear headed. Nowadays it’s just one day at a time type of living.
176106481,Someone said it could be an inner ear problem
176106482,We are a really violent species.
176106483,Good idea. I’ll get some on my next grocery order. Thanks.

176106488,It is going to be okay. Express your emotions. I know you will get by.
176106489,"I’ve heard of allergic reactions, but nothing on an infection or inflammation in the forehead area. Maybe, a medication like Cogentin (Benztropine), would help."

176106491,"Voices want me to kill my grandma, especially her, with an axe on her forehead"
176106492,"wow, that’s too bad. I can hire family and friends, like your stepdaughter, all you have to do is claim SCL hours for them to get paid. I had a broker for my son, and we would go thru all the money allowed, and if the care givers could get a raise. I try telling this to my family, it was me that gave you a raise, no other higher authority,"
176106493,"yeah, people on here know that _NAME_ has an anger problem too and he always blames it on me. yeah, right, I never raise my voice, I’m just being myself, and if that’s not good enough, too bad."
176106494,"I was dxed at 18. I was a bright teenager, but young for my age when it came to being independent. I’d not done much to do a before and after comparison. In terms of prospects: Before: Expected to go to university. Get a reasonable/good degree. Professional -white collar job . After: Never employed. Social housing. Married for nearly 19 years. Lived with wife 22 years. Wife developed vascular dementia 2002/2003. Died 2005. Struggled to cope. Wife when well had been the dominant & practical minded partner. Gradual self neglect after she died. Stepdaughter made several attempts to get me to move . Resisted due to high anxiety. 2016/17- My block of flats in line to be demolished. Agreed very anxiously to move near my youngest stepdaughter. She arranged everthing. Did a marvellous job. Doing better due to a good and moderate level of support."
176106495,"I have a terrible resume. I kept getting my ex husband upset by working and I would have to quit. Plus, I would get mentally ill from the stress of working and quit a lot of jobs for that reason. I have terrible performance too. The paranoia and stress overwhelm me and I fail as a result"
176106496,Thank you that was really helpful _AT_MENTION_ . Sorry to bother you again _AT_MENTION_ but you have good skills.

176106500,"_AT_MENTION_ Your mother wants you alive. She might find a hospital visit to be inconvenient, but inside she wants you alive. Have you been to the hospital before?"
176106501,Thank you. I appreciate your kind words. I always appreciate the comments in this forum. Thank you.
176106502,There’s no one here to take me. I can’t drive. I have visions and I’m agitated
176106503,I’m frustrated with my laziness but I feel less anxious about it. Maybe the zoloft is helping. I’m not sure. I’m going to see this moment as a gift in spite of what may come.
176106504,I can’t talk about mine either. Because they are religious beliefs and it sucks. Me and piano girl talked a lot about it and also being a targeted individual. But you can freely express any belief you want on Reddit
176106505,"So whatever you’re doing right, keep doing it! Most jobs have a learning curve. Ideally, they want you to be perfect and learn the job perfect in a day or two. But realistically, they know you’re going to make a few mistakes and it will take a little while for you to get down the routine and learn the job well. My first job was a dishwasher. My first week I was constantly asking the waitresses where the clean glasses get put away or where do the clean mugs go, or the silverware etc. I picked up on a little impatience on the part of a few of the waitresses but hey, if I didn’t ask, how was I supposed to know??? I eventually learned to be a pretty good dishwasher, so good that I got promoted to cook which was the job every dishwasher coveted. You’ll learn and be fine."
176106506,i can’t read long texts either… books are a no no for me… at least if it’s a story that you need to follow then my memory isn’t good enough to remember what i just read. Maybe it’ll go away but i don’t know since i never been off my meds so i can’t say if it improves more again
176106507,Thank you. _PHONE_NO_
176106508,That sounds nice. I will try that.
176106509,Every two months for 5-10 minutes
176106510,"I use to watch cop shows on tv but stopped. I don’t really watch tv much anymore and I prefer video games. I feel tv shows can be a bit too dramatic and inaccurate, and I have a mental illness where I tend to apply fiction to reality, even when some tv shows clearly state beforehand that the material is fictional and not accurate. I like watching actual cop footage on youtube sometimes. They can be a bit graphic though. I’m religious so I believe in the existence of criminals and their demise. I like seeing the demise of criminals, but without fictional fluff. Some cops can be corrupted. Heck, some cops can be part of big street gangs. But I feel the local governments are structured such that cops aren’t too powerful."
176106511,"It means what I said. It gives people an unrealistic image of what sex is supposed to be like, look like, sound like, and it gives people too high expectations of how it’s supposed to be"
176106512,"I assume you want the site to take a clear stand in accordance with your beliefs. People should be free to hold their own opinion and not be banned or chastised for it by the powers that be. While some may be triggered by talk of assisted suicide others are triggered by a loss of their freedom. There is a huge difference between the state seeking out the mentally ill then killing them and the state allowing someone who is really suffering from mental illness to end their own life. I am against the former, I am for the latter. If you don’t want to die don’t access the service."
176106513,_PERSON_ maybe. I would say…if you wanted to try…research the most widely successful methods. I know mindfulness of breathing and body scans are two of the most popular

176106519,"I usually meet with people and do activities to help my mental health, but now everything is closed down where I live. Well the stores are still open, but the’re basically empty. Any government funded program has closed down. That means libraries, mental health offices, food banks, schools and support groups. There’s other business shut down too like pizza hut. There’s only been one person with the virus in our town. I’m finding it difficult to stay at home. These outings are an important part of the balance I’ve created to keep focused on my day to day stuff instead of just on my visions. Is anyone else struggling in this regard?"

176106521,"Man I watched the video. The 3:33a doodle freaked me right out but. Anywho, I do nearly all of these things. The caffeine. The phone. So that’s a thing. I don’t smoke and I don’t think my blood sugar is out of the normal range. It hasn’t happened in such a long time but I also haven’t gone to bed before 2am in a long time. I was just exhausted after work last night. So the stress thing also plays a role. I’m an all around mess."

176106526,I was on 1 mg. for 40 years or so. Worked fairly well.
176106527,"Eh, not really. I don’t have regrets. I would’ve done the same things given the opportunity."

176106543,Yeah. I have decreased sex drive. It’s rare when I can climax.

There’s a paper that says that those preonset with high iq of sz (often associated with AS) recover better in terms of symptoms and have the best chance; but they also can have levels of bipolarity —- I feel it points towards myself as an example; I may not be great at using my intellect academically, but socially or verbally rather, I do pretty well compared to the average person. A psychiatrist once outright said I was above average intelligence and it was only after he told me that did I reflect on my meeting w him and realise maybe _PERSON_ is real and that maybe I do have a decent level of intellect when not in psychosis."

176106564,How to be less irritable?
174369108,"Your weight gain may be due to ablify. Weight Gain Researchers in 2009 studied second-generation antipsychotic medications, including Abilify, and their association with “rapid and significant” weight gain in youth. Their study published in JAMA found first-time use of the medications was associated with significant weight gain. Study participants who took aripiprazole gained 9.7 pounds after an average of about 11 weeks of treatment. A group of participants who didn’t take the drug gained less than half a pound. Researchers wrote that previous studies also found weight gain in adults taking the drug, but it was not as rapid and as significant as in youth. In general, the drug’s effects on weight are thought to be less than other antipsychotics."
176106565,"I actually think it’s more because I missed out on so much of being human and alive as a kid and now I’m making up for it. Sure a little hate manifests itself sometimes, I’m not happy with myself or my life a lot of times. But I choose to honestly like people."

I am being worked up for cancer as I text, and I am not in the least bit afraid of dying. I’m too close to God for that."

The last 2 years there I hardly went in, I would leave after a half hr-hr into the time there because I got paranoid and couldnt handle it, or I wouldn’t go in at all. When I had to work 5-10pm it was scary and I’d hallucinate/ get changes of perception. I haven’t walked in there since I quit. My mom is forcing me to call there, and I’m afraid to. The reason she wants me to call is for a reference for volunteering. I said there’s gotta be positions somewhere that you don’t need a reference.

174369102,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Efficiency of jumping exercise in improving bone mineral density among premenopausal women: a _NAME_-analysis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.), Oct 2014 Jumping exercise is frequently regarded as an optimum strategy for increasing pubertal bone growth, but its role in promoting or preserving adult bone mineral density (BMD) is still undefined.This _NAME_-analysis aimed to evaluate the evidence for the influence of jumping exercise on BMD in premenopausal women and to define the effectiveness of high-impact exercise in improving or maintaining female bone health.We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Google Scholar and BIOSIS up to 1 September 2013 for jumping exercise influence on BMD in premenopausal women. The search terms used were 'jumping', 'skipping', 'brief exercise', 'high impact', 'bone density', 'BMD', 'femoral neck', 'lumbar spine', and 'trochanter', and the search was limited to females. Six papers met the search criteria.Six 
studies on BMD in the femoral neck (Q = 2.63, p = 0.854, I (2) = 0.0 %), trochanter (Q = 2.10, p = 0.10, I (2) = 0.0 %) and lumbar spine (Q = 1.17, p = 0.979, I (2) = 0.0 %) were highly homogenous in determining skeletal responses to jumping exercise. Jumping exercise significantly increased BMD in the femoral neck {weighted mean difference (WMD) [fixed effect] = 0.017 g/cm(2), 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.014-0.20, p < 0.001} and trochanter (WMD [fixed effect] = 0.021, 95 % CI 0.018-0.024, p < 0.001). However, the lumbar spine seemed to benefit less from such high-impact exercise (p = 0.181). Visual inspection of the plots implicated some degree of asymmetry, indicating a slightly positive treatment effect at the femoral neck and trochanter sites.Based on _NAME_-analysis of existing studies, the sensitivity of skeletal response to jumping exercise in premenopausal women is significant and site-specific, with significant benefit from high-impact exercise noted, especially at the hip."

176106620,"I’ve quit all sorts of things, drugs, coffee, smoking, meat, porn, etc… The one thing that I use to accomplish this is I ask myself what kind of person I want to be when I go out of this world. Do I want to be someone who just let addictions (which are essentially life-stealing problems in many cases) run their life, or do I want to go out as the best version of myself. Once you’ve decided that, it’s a matter of just making a decision and sticking to it. People say “one day at a time”, and all that, and that’s somewhat true, but what worked for me was focusing far in the future where I want to be, rather than where I currently was. Many of the things that we do that are addictions are just ways of making ourselves feel good quickly. Once you see that pattern I find it’s also easier to replace bad things with good things that make you feel good. Lastly, you can do it."

Addictions took a year to develop and slowly became more severe. Now I get positive symptoms if I go down from 4mg to 3mg Risperdal. Honestly I think the reason of being stable on low dose Abilify is that it improves negative symptoms. I think positive and negative symptoms affect each other."

And it creates a massive puzzle with many pieces that you need to painstakingly put together to navigate your way to a new life.

Sz is not the only disorder that messes up peoples lives. The art of being able to re-build, and doing so in a sustainable way is what needs to happen. If people give up on you, and you give up on yourself, it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy and you will lead a life controlled by your illness.

176106721,"You are intelligent and not all doctors are so endowed. They have their limits, while others may be intellectual giants. For example, I am only of fair intelligence and love beating doctors and psychologists on the word game Countdown. While they may have studied verbatim text books and got their doctorates, they may lack practical insight and application. What I am trying to say is that it is possible your ocd and intellectuality has been lost in the system, however, you have mentioned some magical thinking on some of your posts which could indicate some form of psychosis spectrum disorder. When you mix a tinge of magical thinking and explaining intellectuality of existentialism, it could easily be lost in translation, if you know what I mean… It seems identifying these obsessions to the core base needs to be addressed and one of them being the sz diagnosis (need for approval), while the other existential obsessions are indeed separate and should be treated as such. For example, a reason for a s
z diagnosis is bad because of societal presumptions, intellectual integrity etc. Then you take these reasons and deal with them as I am sure you have been taught over the years. Keep the derealisation separate with its physical manifestations of ocd apart from the need for a reappraising of sz diagnosis, which is probably why you have these existential crises in the first place. I am sure you must be hurting somewhat with having all these obsessions and I can only guess your pain with the ocd. That is my two cents anyway."

It was clear to me in my 50’s that I needed more than living alone in my apartment so I’ve been in a home for quite a while. It’s been a good home for me here but the providers are getting older too, so I may have to make another adjustment before I die. I used to say I wanted to live to be 100 but I don’t even have the energy to think about that anymore. I am concentrating on getting a more positive idea of children and where I can be of help to them. I was always very negative toward any ideas of mothering. It’s never too late to learn."

176106738,ye when I meet my doc I will ask
174369150,I found I I had to make a med change. I could not get off the couch at all with Risperdal. When I changed to Clozapine I could actually lift weights and ride a bicycle. I tried all the appetite suppressants and it’s not effective for long term weight loss. I still get extremely hungry. I found that if I eat healthy and exercise I will eventually reach my goals.
176106739,ahh thanks so nice to hear…
176106740,"Ok I believe I have a hidden camera implanted in me as you all know. My problem with that is that I want my privacy. How have you guys coped with delusions like mine? I really believe this is real. I know that wireless cameras would have to have a built in transmitter so it might be too large to implant in my body, but I hear the tv talking about me and people in general talking about me. I don’t see how else they would see me unless there was a hidden camera implanted in me. How do you guys talk yourselves out of your delusions? I’m afraid to be around people because I’m afraid they are going to say evil things to me. I’m tired of being taunted. I really believe this is real and I just want people to tell me the truth if it’s true. The people around me says it’s nothing implanted in me yet I hear them talk about me. I just need to see how I can break this delusion if it’s not real. Can someone help me?"

I got really bad sideeffects from abilify the very first day like twitching, pains in my head, inconsistent heartbeats and breathing, and nausea. For me the right thing to do was to quit ablifiy right away and get back on olanzapine. I managed to have my doctor recently agree that I only take 3,75mg olanzapine which is working fine so far. I was on 5mg before. The only real problem I have is brain inflammation probably caused by the drugs which causes physical pain in my head, but I’m taking anti-inflammatory supplements to help me out. Right now is the best I’ve had it in a long time medicine wise since 3,75 seems to just be enough to keep me cool, and I get less side-effects on a lower dose."

I’m interested in whether or not schizophrenic’s motivational problems are coming from the disease or the drugs, as so would like to contrast with Bipolar people.

176106780,"I have worked in multiple places since I was fortunate and blessed enough to graduate college. This is around my 5th formal job. I haven’t lasted more than two years in any of them because of motivation. At my current place, it’s been a year and 7 months. Yet I don’t feel like I have any energy or motivation to continue. I can basically do my tasks as far as skills/ ability are concerned but I can’t bring myself to do it. It’s hard to explain to people who are not familiar with what we deal with. Last few months, I quit and my boss pleaded me to come back because I later explained that I am struggling with a mental illness. This time, I think my not doing my tasks might delay a project I am working on, and this would negatively affect my department. Should I quit now? over email or phone? I am working from home and the stress has been too much. I wish I could quit but I would have to move back in with parents which is in itself very stressful."

After being up for days spun out and .not being able to fall asleep I started taking all the different pills I had at my house plus alcohol. I kept taking pills and kept drinking until I passed out. I was comatose for 3 days. When I finally came to I went to the doctor and told her what happened and asked for help to quit meth. She told me the first step in quitting meth was to not do it anymore. So I stopped. The next few years were horrible and everything seemed so hard. One day I was driving over a ridge and the sun came through the trees and warm feeling came over me and I felt a shift and everything became easy again. Quitting drugs and alcohol allowed me to dedicate my life to becoming a mother. 15 years passed and sadly, in a manic episode I fell off the wagon. While under the influence I went to my doctor’s office and s
he sedated me and consoled me by assuring me that I didn’t have to start my count all over again. Here It is at the 25 year mark and I can hardly believe it’s even the same life. I could never imagine disrespecting myself that way now."

176106792,"So I put down the book on chakras after getting to the description of the physical exercises. I just can’t bring myself to do them, and this is unsurprising as I have been told numerous times that the balance between my solar plexus and brow chakra is way out of line Making the transition begins with meditating on the solar plexus before activating it for physical work. I’d like to work in a supermarket to build up my tolerance to physically ordering things rather than do t’ai ji which is purely martial. On the other hand yoga would be more in keeping with healing myself by stilling the mind. Stimulating my ego with a vast array of products is bound to send me crazy eventually The best thing I could do is gardening, and with this in mind I’ve got some pot plants, but my bonsai tree hasn’t sprouted leaves in over a year, though I’m convinced it’s still alive. I’m trying to read a book entitled “Healing the space within by beautifying the space around you”, which is about the bene
fits of keeping a tidy home, however it began with a discourse on how everyone was on the internet cluttering up the biosphere with garbage (my words), and I felt too ill to proceed beyond the first paragraph. I did however tidy my room a bit, which is progress. I need to change my sheets, clean my kitchen, and re-apply for my shiatsu course. I missed half the first practical term because of relapsing so I don’t know if I can proceed to the next, although I can definitely do the theory. It’s not so expensive as courses go and run by a compatriot who studied in Japan, but finances is also a slight problem, I might have to take a loan from my mother.

I don’t know how to approach the situation, because I don’t have mood swings. I’m Diagnosed as Bipolar 1 because in rehab I told them I was bipolar as it was a more acceptable and as a co occurring diagnosis . I don’t have an addiction I just need to change my life around. Like with schizophrenia and other labels I feel AFTER the treatment I began to develop symptoms of the disorder. Like I didn’t do crack cocaine before I went to rehab and I had never shot up. I had to say for 100 hours a week that I was an addict and at the rehab they got mad and were unsure I was an addict. I overdosed on heroin so I was sent to rehab but it was more of a mistake and I haven’t touched it again. Then I wasnt allowed to come home from rehab and my parents wanted to live in the halfway house. I guess they thought it would fix me. Now they’ve taken my car and

176106809,Sweden was the worst country for me. They bullied me as teen for being ugly and as a adult when I worked half time instead of encouraging me and saying I was good they were saying they work full time and are therefore better than me. Swedish people were very stuck up and hateful and judgmental and bullies and only those who work have worth those who don’t work have no worth and do t even deserve food. That’s how they treated me when I lived I. Sweden. I was born in Sweden. I’m Australian now and treated better in Australia. Treated much better here. It’s not “you don’t deserve food cause you don’t work” attitude or “we work you don’t we are better than you”… So my personal experience of Scandinavia Sweden is really not good but very bad.

174369164,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Validity and utility of Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP): I. Psychosis superspectrum. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ South, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)REFERENCES, Jun 2020 The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a scientific effort to address shortcomings of traditional mental disorder diagnoses, which suffer from arbitrary boundaries between psychopathology and normality, frequent disorder co-occurrence, heterogeneity within disorders, and diagnostic instability. This paper synthesizes evidence on the validity and utility of the thought disorder and detachment spectra of HiTOP. These spectra are composed of symptoms and maladaptive traits currently subsumed within schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and schizotypal, paranoid and schizoid personality 
disorders. Thought disorder ranges from normal reality testing, to maladaptive trait psychoticism, to hallucinations and delusions. Detachment ranges from introversion, to maladaptive detachment, to blunted affect and avolition. Extensive evidence supports the validity of thought disorder and detachment spectra, as each spectrum reflects common genetics, environmental risk factors, childhood antecedents, cognitive abnormalities, neural alterations, biomarkers, and treatment response. Some of these characteristics are specific to one spectrum and others are shared, suggesting the existence of an overarching psychosis superspectrum. Further research is needed to extend this model, such as clarifying whether mania and dissociation belong to thought disorder, and explicating processes that drive development of the spectra and their subdimensions. Compared to traditional diagnoses, the thought disorder and detachment spectra demonstrated substantially improved utility: greater reliability, larger explanatory and p
redictive power, and higher acceptability to clinicians. Validated measures are available to implement the system in practice. The more informative, reliable and valid characterization of psychosis-related psychopathology offered by HiTOP can make diagnosis more useful for research and clinical care."

176106837,I talked to my Dr. about Diet pills and this is what she said she said no to all diet pills and if I wanted to try any diet pills to discuss it with my Family Dr. First. But I decided to not take diet pills ever Because I had bad experience taking diet pills a year ago I took Garcinia Cambodia and it caused my mania to come back and severe chest pain. So I immediately stopped taking it even though I did lose some weight its not worth jeopardizing my Health to become thinner or possibly having a heart attack or something more serious so I will just keep going to the gym and hopefully some day in the long run it will pay off I hope so anyway if not I am just wasting my time.

Many people seem to feel that they are on TV, which might suggest you are experiencing a delusion. You could also have a look at psychological theories that claim that humans split themselves and in a sense self observe, which might suggest you are more aware of this self-observation than most, but that you are interpreting it in a delusional way. I have posted such theories on this forum so you can search for them here with the names of the theorists such as “_NAME_,” “_PERSON_” or “_PERSON_.” _NAME_, the father of economics, writing in the 18th century, is the most down to earth."

But i have pointed others in that direction and they have been helped even more. Sometimes some people can get disability and SSI. Not always. Again it depends on different factors.

Or even if they made your more positive? Tbh, the zyprexa doesnt fix my thinking still, its a pity… I remain a big thinker even lol, but something is not fine in my head, nope… Maybe i am just a worried person who still sees all in black, but i wish the ap could give even some ‘‘kick’’…"

174369190,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cardiovascular effects of psychotic illnesses and antipsychotic therapy. _NAME_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Heart (British Cardiac Society) , Aug 22 2019 Mortality from cardiovascular disease is increased in people with mental health disorders in general and schizophrenia in particular. The causes are multifactorial, but it is known that antipsychotic medication can cause cardiac side-effects beyond the traditional coronary risk factors. Schizophrenia itself is a contributor to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality via cardiac autonomic dysfunction and a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, both contributing to a reduced life expectancy. The pro-arrhythmic impact of traditional antipsychotics, especially via the hERG-potassium channel, has been known for several years. Newer antipsychotics have a reduced pro-arrhythmic profile but might contribute to higher cardiac death rates by worsening the metabolic profile. Clozapine-induced cardiomyopathy, which is dose in
dependent, is a further concern and continuous monitoring of these patients is required. Prophylaxis with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is currently under review. Overall, management of cardiovascular risk within this population group must be multifaceted and nuanced to allow the most effective treatment of serious mental illness to be conducted within acceptable parameters of cardiovascular risk; some practical measures are presented for the clinical cardiologist."

erefor imbalanced ways of thinking. and strong beliefs in particular will really make someone delusional. I think your head can almost switch gears though from a background in ‘spiritual’ thought to natural thought and natural thought somehow gets thoughts back to normal. also focus on normal human communication and having friends seems to switch the focus especially if very involved or interested. some things that got me well again from delusional thought."

174369196,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [Cognitive explanations of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: An inventory of the scientific literature]. A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, L'Encephale, Mar 2020 07 Our article consists in both analysis and synthesis of contemporary cognitive models of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia. Our work is based on the analysis of the scientific literature including original articles, literature reviews as well as _NAME_-analysis.In order to identify the most pertinent studies in the electronic search, the three following databases were systematically searched: PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. For both the analysis and synthesis we selected original articles, literature reviews as well as _NAME_-analysis referring to any cognitive explanation of the auditory hallucinatory experience in schizophrenia. A cognitive model of auditory hallucinations refers to any incorporation of cognitive frameworks and explanations in one's conceptualization of the hallucinatory phenome
non in schizophrenia. We also focused our work on past conceptualization of auditory hallucinations in order to explain the development and the contribution of current cognitive models in the understanding of the onset and the maintaining of AVHs. After a brief review of clinical characteristics and historical conceptualization of auditory verbal hallucinations, contemporary explanations were presented in the area of schizophrenia. These explanations referred to researches into cognitive psychopathology including metacognitive as well as neuroimaging studies.The examination of scientific literature highlighted the complexity of AVHs through multifactorial explanations here mostly explained by cognitive and metacognitive deficits. We synthesized former conceptualizations of AVHs, which were sustained on mechanistic or sensory explanations. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ were the first as conceiving AVHs as a perception disorder and introduced the idea that auditory hallucinations resulted from a failure to co
ntrol one's memories/fantasies. Later, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ discovered auditory areas in the human brain implicated in language comprehension and production. AVHs began to be conceptualized by the scientific world as being mechanistically brain-related. _PERSON_ was among the first to study the meaning of AVHs, a domain still being investigated by todays cognitive sciences. More recently, neuroimaging studies allowed the validation of these sensory explanations in considering the onset of AVHs through the deficit of cortical and subcortical areas implicated in the process of languages (e.g. Broca and Wernicke areas) and emotions (e.g. limbic system, _USER_ID_, hippocampus). At a more mechanistic level, contemporary cognitive models of AVHs explained AVHs as an intrusive verbal representation into the awareness which is non-inhibited (i.e. deficit in intentional inhibition) and also non-recognized as one's own experience (i.e. deficit in source monitoring, planning and metacognition), or even attributed to an 
external source (attribution bias). In terms of inhibitory control, inhibition is a basic cognitive mechanism defined as a collection of processes that allows the suppression of previously activated cognitive contents and the clearing of irrelevant actions or attention from consciousness. Intentional inhibition is effortful and occurs when an individual deliberately suppresses the activation of an item after deciding it is irrelevant. Theoretical support for the suggestion that an inhibitory failure is involved in AVHs in schizophrenia arises from studies that have shown that a failure in inhibition results in intrusive thoughts from long-term memory. Recent findings also found that individuals with AVHs in schizophrenia demonstrated an impaired source monitoring. In episodic memory research, a distinction was made between content (an event) and context (e.g. source or temporal characteristics of an event) information. The context of memories provides cues that allow an individual to differentiate one memory 
from other memories. AVHs are conceptualized as a failure to access the contextual cues that would allow voice-hearer to form an intact representation of events in memories. Regarding planning, AVHs refer to the intrusion of unwanted memories into the inner speech that are not recognized from one's own representation. Previous cognitive theories highlighted the important role played by metacognitive skills and belief (i.e. thinking about one's thinking) in the explanation of AVHs. Finally, the external attribution bias was extensively studied over the last three decades and refers to the tendency to attribute negative events (situational or cognitive) to an external source. In this framework, AVHs refer to intrusive thoughts externally attributed to a voice.For more than one century, scientific discoveries in (bio)medical science have allowed the validation of former sensory and mechanistic explanations of AVHs. Nevertheless, many explanatory models account for the way AVHs are maintained (source monitoring, 
deficit in planning, externalizing bias), while they scarcely expose how they are triggered (intrusive thoughts, deficit in inhibition). The relation between AVHs and intrusive thoughts still remain unclear, and further studies are needed for the understanding of a potential causal relationship."

176106995,Clomipramine increases hypomania chance while lamotrigine decreases it. To answer your question you need to first remain without taking any for a period like 1 week. If you exhihibit hypomania then need to restart taking lamotrigine. On the other hand if feel more depressed than now you can try taking small dose of clomipramine. Anyway be aware of side effects. Omega 3 have proven cognitive benefits for all people. To feel the difference need to take it daily and consistently.

Pacific time then that would logically lead me to believe that some of the more recent quakes could have just been aftershocks and if that is the case then my yell likely had nothing to do with them, or did it intensify the after shock in Samoa which happened within minutes of one of my yells?"

My pdr doesn’t know why this happened, I think he broke my better working brain with it and doesn’t want to say it. He told me it might improve my negatives but I think he’s just using me as a lab rat to try not proven meds to treat negative symptoms.

176107063,I dont want SSI I want job support and I dont have transportation so Im screwed. My parents won’t help me get a job unless its up to their ideals–like I could have either gotten the Pell Grant to return to get an Associates or my dad would pay for ONE CLASS. I can’t function like this—too much control over what I want to do with my life. They would not let me leave the house for months so one day I just up and ran away with a guy I met on twitter because I was so sick of it all.

Like I’m going to have a problem if I clunk into a rocking chair or something… like there’s potential energy and something could “give”. To put a fine point on it… I blame society for my mental anguish… and sometimes wonder if that’s not a big enough “pound of flesh” for them. Seriously… as Coldplay sings: “nobody said it was supposed to be this hard”.

174369226,"Back when I got paranoia regularly I worked on targeting my thought processes once I gained insight. So instead of thinking I’m terrified–>why am I terrified–>I must be in danger–>there are ghosts/demons in the room–>I’m not safe I changed it to I’m terrified–>I have a psychotic disorder and this is paranoia, my brain is dumping random fear chemicals right now–>I am safe That helped a lot with keeping me from panic mode. Sometimes though I’d cheat and pray and that would make me feel better. Other times I’d do something like turn the TV on or a youtube video to watch, or if it was really bad, go sleep with my brother Mainly you want to keep reminding yourself it’s just your brain dumping chemicals and that you’re not in any real danger, and then distract yourself until it passes. If you have benzos, take a benzo. I have found that stops a paranoia attack in its tracks. They are a good short term pharm method of dealing with paranoia until you’re stabilized on a good AP."
176107091,"L-theanine is derived from green tea. A box of 100 green tea bags costs $1 at the Dollar Tree. I think each bag of green tea has 50 mg of L-theanine. So, if I make two pots of tea, at separate times of the day, each pot with three green tea bags, and drink them, I’m getting 300 mg of L-theanine a day. So, if I buy five boxes of green tea bags, 100 in each box, that will last me 83 days. That means I will be paying $5 every two and a half months for my L-theanine. Of course, there is the issue of caffeine, but green tea has substantially less caffeine than coffee."

As for the labels bit, I have been told by a number of professionals that labels are not really important they are just for insurance purposes. Really what is important is your symptoms and finding what helps manage them. God doctors should lose their licenses for publishing stuff like psych meds don’t work.

176107159,"IMHO if you follow a vegan diet and many of my fb friends did, then this has led me to believe that after a couple of years they all end up depressed. They supplement with B12 but I can only guess that the body doesn’t synthesize it the same way as eating meat does. Then they go on antidepressants of which millions of animals died for in testing these drugs negating the compassion that they often started veganism for. The fact is that even if you are vegan then animals and insects still die to bring the grains and legumes to the plate through the devastating pesticides killing trillions of insects and the food chain in the animals around them. To exist on this planet creatures will die. It is a fact and whether you prefer not to kill cows, sheep, chickens etc. is a preference many choose to avoid killing, thinking their conscience is clear. It is a denial of existence and is a sentimentality based on compassion for those specific animals, but alas it is all in vain. If you don’t want to eat the 
creatures bred into existence for the sole purpose of eating then that is your choice and I don’t begrudge you for it. I used to be a vegetarian for a over a decade, but I am no longer because it is smoke and mirrors and to me pointless."

And to stop you meds for a feeling that you want and have no control over is not wise. Happiness is harder than just quitting your meds. No quick solutions to mental illness. It takes work. Work within your means with the tools you have and who you are right now. Be content because you are loved. Don’t risk another psychotic episode and set yourself back a year or two. _AT_MENTION_"

176107194,"It may come from anxiety, but it’s always safe to check with a doctor. I felt some chest pain these months and, after some exams, they showed nothing. My doctor said it was probably from psychological issues (she didn’t say it was from anxiety specifically). I’ll still do some more exams just to make sure it’s nothing though."
176107195,"The majority of people diagnosed with schizophrenia had substance abuse issues. That’s usually attributed to most of us had underlying brain chemistry issues we were trying to fix using weed etc, and not causing schizophrenia itself. The flat 1% rate of people who get schizophrenia is everywhere, so there is no direct correlation with smoking weed and getting schizophrenia. I was told by my pysch that it certainly exacerbates the illness and can cause the inevitable onset to develop sooner and a psychotic break to occur earlier. This is just what I’ve read/been told."
176107196,"I hate spam calls, they threaten to arrest me if I don’t give my social insurance number. I block them everytime but they keep calling from a different number everytime. Maybe they got my number when I sold things on Kijiji. Pretty sure its that."

176107198,"Another day sober yesterday. Felt good, not having that constant craving to medicate myself, take matters in my own hand, and numb to the point of oblivion.

176107220,who cares what others think hey?
176107221,"I’m on Asenapine now, and take Quetiapine as needed. Even 25mg of Quetiapine makes me sleepy, and I start to slur my words and move heavily. It’s great for anxiety and psychotic symptoms. Asenapine is great. Minimal side effects, weight neutral, works wonders for my symptoms. It makes me drowsy, but I take it before bed, so it doesn’t matter."
176107222,Hopefully it works. Maybe you just need a break until your meds are right.
174369255,I have bipolar and SCHIZOPHRENIA. My current psychiatrist and therapist have it all wrong. People with bipolar disorder function. I am not functioning! The schizoaffective diagnosis that my last psychiatrist and therapist gave me was correct. Even the psych hospital got it right!
176107223,With regards to psychosis 100% but not other stuff. I get really bad anxiety and mood symtoms or so they feel bad to me.
176107224,"I’m actually pretty good at taking my medication. I’ve only forgotten every now and then. I would recommend you remain on your medications, and think of a strategy that helps you remember to take them. _AT_MENTION_ uses the pill pots, i think that is a good strategy to help you remember."

176107269,"So…I have one friend in the world whom I trust and I am so grateful for her , January 2020 I left a toxic relationship that had been on and off more off tbh for 6 years … things where going well for me , I made new friends got things together with myself , stopped drinking , however almost as quick as my new friends and positives came I managed to find myself pulling away .smaller groups of friends formed and I became a loner , now people who seemingly hated each other are now best of friends and im on the outside again , I know that schizophrenia can really affect how we form healthy relationships but I feel like im a terrible person and thats why things never work out . My friend _PERSON_ tells me everyday this isn’t true and its my self esteem issues making me hate and loath everything about myself . I had a good friend in this group, three actually but one in particular became an obsessive thought for me and I hounded the heck out of him , he ghosted me alot and I struggled with this and 
asked if he could be honest about why and he said I was much too much , which I understood, I was aware I was getting carried away . Checking if they were online , wanting to know their every move , I tried to not let things overwhelm me but I guess I haven’t got that down. This all happens before Christmas, now some context to what happened on Christmas day is , My Father whom I loved dearly passed away 7 years ago , this broke me , I had been through psychosis only 6 months before and his death tied into delusions . My mother tells me quite casually that I may not be his daughter after Christmas Dinner. I say nothing and hug her trying to digest both the meal now stuck in my throat and the information I have just recieved , then I leave … I preceeded then to drink myself into oblivion and slate everyone , the demon came out as it where , feeling ashamed for my actions and heart broken about what my mum told me I went to see my ex toxic relationship and his father as they where friends with the man I cal
l dad , I just wanted reassurance, I dont even know why , also I had messaged the person I had been obsessing over and basically told him to go ???? himself … also not a great move . Since boxing day I have been in contact with my toxic ex until he threatened to throw a brick through my window and I couldn’t talk to him as the panic of being trapped is washing over me , I feel as though I escaped horrors and was shown something better , just to ???? all over it and come back to terror , my symptoms have come back ten fold , I saw a woman crawl from my TV and I have not been able to communicate with people, if I try to play a game there are messages hidden in the speech and text the new friends I made where on xbox , my ex also recieved a message saying can I ask u some stuff and I believe it to be one of these other friends hoping to damage me in some way *my ex doesn’t know about my other friends per se as I was isolated from all of my other friends and he gets insanely jealous * There has also been vi
olence throughout the 7 years of us knowing each other . This is also no coincidence, I spoke to my ex after my dad passed in some way to connect with him and grieve , we would share stories and talk about memories of him . And this morning I wake up to find all of the friends I had made where with their so called enemies and I knew I would be the talk of the town . This anxiety has made me even more symptomatic and due to covid I cant see my doctor . My house is in absolute disarray and I have one friend from the group that may still have a positive view of me , I hope so because she has helped me so much however I’m now in the predicament of feeling like I deserve all of this because of my schizophrenia or am I just a shitty person ?! , I had several delusions that challenged these friends and needing constant reassurance is not a desirable quality… sorry about this rant but I feel truly isolated besides potentially 2 people on which I feel a burden , I keep contemplating the world without me and then I 
think im not even worth the drama of suicide , ide rather just hide alone and save the world my toxicity … Hope everyone is doing ok and thanks as always for listening guys , im hoping to feel better"
176107270,"Thanks for relating with me. Appreciate it. I left voicemails and his receptionist never picks up when its my number calling. I did act very horrible though while in hospital.

176107291,_AT_MENTION_ Having anxiety about having symptoms doesn’t mean you’re glorifying or fishing for anything. No one chooses what they get anxious about. I don’t think accusing anyone of that is ever really helpful and will just increase anxiety and potentially add shame. It’s just not really ever needed. Encourage people to trust their doctors but you don’t have to accuse people of faking which is how what you said came across.

176107334,"_AT_MENTION_ To the best of my knowledge, irs.gov is the real website for the IRS, so they will not steal your info. That said, this situation is ripe for scammers. The IRS will never call, text or email you. If you receive anything in the mail claiming to be from the IRS, including a check, verify its authenticity by calling the IRS (1-800-829-1040) before doing anything. Also, this check is called the Economic Impact Payment (EIP), not “stimulus check,” “stimulus,” or anything else. I’m doing nothing right now because there’s too much confusion for me. The “Get My Payment” portal seems to be just for people who filed a tax return in the last two years. For non-filers (like me), you’re directed to another portal, which then sends you to another website, which the IRS says is secure.

174369304,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of psychotic symptoms on cognitive impairment in patients with bipolar disorder. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Industrial psychiatry journal , Jan-Jun 2019 A considerable proportion of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have psychotic symptoms during the illness. This subset of BD due to its genetic susceptibility and family segregation has considerable overlap with schizophrenia. However, the extent to which BD patients with psychotic symptoms and without psychotic symptoms differ on neurocognitive functions is still not completely clear.The aim of this study was to examine the neurocognitive functions in BD patients with psychotic symptoms and BD without psychotic symptoms in comparison with healthy volunteers (HVs).Thirty patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition BD (16 with psychotic symptoms) and thirty age- and sex-matched HVs were recruited in the study. Clinical severity was asses
sed using structured rating scales. The presence of psychotic symptoms was assessed using the Lifetime Dimensions of Psychosis Scale (LDPS). All patients underwent tests, namely continuous performance test, Stroop Word-Color interference test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, to measure executive functions. Differences between groups were examined using analysis of covariance with age and sex as covariates.There was a significant difference between groups on the performance of all the three tests, with patients performing poorer than HVs. While the HVs differed from both BD with psychotic symptoms and without psychotic symptoms, there was no difference between BD patients with and without psychotic symptoms. There was no significant correlation between LDPS score and scores on neurocognitive tests.The study findings, at least with respect to cognitive function, suggest that BD with psychotic symptoms may not be a categorically distinct subtype of BD. Cognitive functions need to be assessed in all patients wit
h BD, regardless of psychotic symptoms, and remediation interventions need to be provided."

And to this thread’s author: you ask if your experience of schizophrenia is atypical or not & the only thing I can think to point out is that no two people experience schizophrenia in the same way. There may be commonalities, but even then, people may react to & process the same phenomena differently. I think the best you can do is just spend some time reading here on the forum (or elsewhere) & see which experiences you relate to and which you don’t. Better yet, go see a doctor!

I’m 100 lbs overweight, a chronic smoker, I’m weak, I’m dying a slow, self-inflicted death via schizophrenia, and I drink energy drinks. Never learned karate or was trained, really. I feel like memories are leaking from a parallel universe or something. You are right. They dont or are not supposed to hire or work with mentally ill people. In my opinion, it is too risky. When I am about to feel psychotic/lose touch of reality, I still feel I’m in the CIA, even though I’m not. It’s a delusion. I’m probably scared of them anyways. I reject these thoughts and delusions. Its dangerous anyways. I feel like it stems from a past life from 2011 in college. I was normal before that. Just an average college student who ended up mentally ill. I have memories in a past life of selling my soul to the CIA for eternity. I guess I felt good and pr
otected. I was in the illuminati and left or got kicked out. Selling your soul is very real. People dont understand. Maybe God from the bible has my soul. Not sure. I love him."

174369317,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Executive functions in schizophrenia aging: Differential effects of age within specific executive functions. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, GT Vallet, I _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior, Dec 26 2019 There are common cognitive and brain abnormalities in schizophrenia and healthy aging which may cumulate in schizophrenia aging. However, the course of executive deficits in late-life schizophrenia is still controversial as it remains unclear whether schizophrenia patients show accelerated aging. The use of specific models of executive functions might help to shed new lights on this issue. The aim of this study was then to determine how each of the four specific executive functions (shifting, updating, inhibition and access to long-term memory) is affected by aging in schizophrenia compared to healthy aging. 20 younger (age 18-34), 17 middle-aged (age 35-49) and 25 older (age 59-76) schizophrenia patients and 62 healthy comp
arison participants matched for gender, age and education performed a neurocognitive battery evaluating the four specific executive functions. Schizophrenia patients performed worse than comparison participants on shifting, updating and access, whereas inhibition appeared preserved. Age affected the four functions with increased degradation of shifting and access in schizophrenia patients, whereas updating and inhibition showed a normal decline with age. These results suggest a vulnerability of prefrontal and cingulate cortexes in schizophrenia aging. Moreover, as age affected the specific executive functions differently, remediation programs should be adapted to older patients. Models of specific executive functions are useful for understanding the complexity of cognition in schizophrenia and its course during later life so that healthcare can be adapted accordingly."

Man I miss My _PERSON_ he bought me tons of stuff to practice with. But I never had like delusions of anything religious. My daughter is named after _NAME_ and my kids are half my religion and one follows my Atheist husband.

A couple of days ago I was taking my pulse, and my artery skipped a beat once every four or five beats. I think it has gone away, but I’m still uneasy about it. I’ve told doctors about my short windedness, and two times they gave me a steroid, antibiotics, and an inhaler. Both times it worked for about a day, and then the short windedness came back. I’ve been consuming pathological amounts of sugar. The doctor told me I have very high triglycerides. I’m scared to try to work it off because I get winded so easily."

One thing: I now need to decide what to do with my job. Shall I just drop everything here and now? Which means people I work with might get damaged and I am less capable of paying my debt? Shall I take a short leave and return to finish everything right? Shall I push through and work hard to finish and then quit in a month or so

176107499,It’s complicated living with your parent at 49 years of age but it sure beats share living. I found even your best friends become problems if you live with them…and I lived with people I worked with too so you were with them 24/7. That gets old quickly for someone like me with a bit of paranoia. It’s not going to be easy because it’s not on your terms but the good thing is I’d imagine it’s decent rent for what you get. I know it’s not easy but ignoring and just being solid enough to keep it civil like say hello. Keep it at that. I don’t even talk to most of my neighbors but I’ll still nod and smile. Keep it simple and keep them away from your life if that makes sense. Not easy matey but you can do it.

176107502,"I’ve been living with family (my parents) for the past 20 years since graduating college. I’m grateful for their company and support but I’d like to venture forth and live independently. My mom is against me moving and dad is neutral. My main concern is my addiction to marihuana. I’m approaching six months sober but everyday is a challenge. I’m apprehensive that if I live on my own, I’d fall back into using. Even just thinking of moving elicits thoughts of getting high… no doubt I’ll lose my independence. Without question my chances of relapsing goes up when left to my own doing. I wish I’ve turned the page on my addiction, is it worth the risk? Or maybe I just have to do it, one day my parents will leave and I will have to continue on alone. It’s time I sought independence."

The only indirect cause from beeing poor would be that you got malnutritioned since that can lead to mental illness, or if you live in a environment where you are constantly stressed. There are kings who have been schizoprenic. I’m pretty sure there was a king in england that was insane, and also there was a danish king in the 18th century that was schizoprenic.

Catatonia is lack of activity, lack of emotions, lack of motivation etc which appear like negative symptoms but not actually negative symptoms associated with schizo. I think a general differentiating factor is. In catatonic negative symptoms we have the option to do the needed if try while in schizo negative it feels very hard to do things even if try. Yes reduction in dopamine is the root cause of negative symptoms in both the cases. The reason why i say so is because when i take dopamine boosting things like thyroid pill, tyrosine etc catatonic slowness improves. Catatonia is a mild form of parkinson disease."

We have a box of fruit snacks by no name brand that is $3.50 and there is 800 grams. We have another fruit snack box by nestle that is 2.50 for 600 grams. Which one is better value? and by how much?"
176107680,"Same here. Just enough so that people get through and lift the limitations to success. Expand snap, medicaid in all states and fix the loopholes/safety nets. It can be done in baby steps. People are resistant to major changes but each single attempt in the right direction will go far. UBI should prob. be done for people who are struggling with employment rather than just for everyone like _NAME_ proposed. There should be a balance. A lot of people are fearful of expansion of anything gov. because of this pandemic. I have access to free healthcare and they also offer free Covid19 tests around my state anyways. I decided to get a test done when they advertised that anyone could get this test even if they don’t have symptoms. WV has one of the lowest Covid19 cases in the country. This is due to access to affordable healthcare/medicaid expansion/ high amount of tests / social distancing /lower population and bigger spaces rural communities. All these counted toward our lower mortality and case rate. 
I hope that more states can copy this and expand medicaid which is already starting to happen. We have only recently started opening up restaurants and businesses. We’ve been under a stay at home mandate in this county since March 12th and they are also testing visitors and often not letting people come into WV who haven’t self-isolated. But now that tests are becoming more available this will help solve that. This epidemic is real. I’m not only worried about what will happen from the loss of many people’s yearly wages from their business, but there are people who are really scared that the vaccine is a conspiracy and a lot of anti-vaxxers are spreading even more fear about it. Yes technology does exist to trace people. But I don’t think the vaccine will hurt people or trace them. I hope not, RNA vaccines are new. I think there are other potential treatments in the pipelines. Not only are vaccines in the pipelines but actual treatments. Anti-virals IMO seem to be the most promising treatment for COV
ID19. I’ve had anti-viral treatment which cured hep.c. It took about two months. Without medicaid it would’ve cost $20,000 with Unicare it was free. It prevented me from future liver cancer or other issues, and I don’t have to worry anymore because I have had three followup tests which could not detect it in my bloodstream. New medicine cured me from otherwise chronic hepatitis C and I think anti-virals seeing as the new ones are becoming more effective could be the answer/cure to covid19 I just hope people do realize that. UBI/cash assistance should be used for about a year to stabilize the economy and also more should be given to those worst impacted."

176107741,_AT_MENTION_ . Most people don’t have a choice with medications. We take them because the alternative is madness and pain. Please consider that medications aren’t poison and saying such is pretty offensive for most people here who’ve been through psychosis. It’s not a poison but it’s not something that is easily dealt with anyways for the sufferer. We don’t have a choice with medications. You do. That is offensive to most everyone here.

176107748,"I will also say that, along with medication, cognitive behavioral therapy has really helped me a lot. My therapist gives me homework and reading assignments, and we work on clear goals together. It’s not a substitute for proper medication, but if you’re not ready for meds yet, it’s a really good first step to take. There are workbooks you can do on your own, but I never found them very effective."

176107789,"If your only goal in life is to accumulate more wealth than anyone else, you’re fighting a losing battle! There are always people with deeper inferiority complexes out there who will make more money with less effort, because that’s all that matters to them, and they are Just. Never. Satisfied. It’s hard-wired into their brains that money = esteem, and they continually hunger for wealth, usually foregoing genuine family / friend interaction for purely business reasons, and sometimes replacing those interactions with money, like with trying to “buy” friendship or the love of their family. Sellout mentality! The finer pleasures in life don’t usually cost a whole lot. They can be obtained with a middle class-amount of wealth. Food, shelter, entertainment, love, and respect, for starters. As you climb the heirarchy of needs, your time begins to be worth more and more, but ultimately you have to apply your time to the things that matter, to get back what matters. That never changes."

Now I eat Bagel Bites, 450 calories for nine of them and it satisfies my pizza craving. I haven’t heard of lo-dough before. Your story is reminding me of a quote I saw in a college friend’s room - Pizza is like sex, even when it’s bad it’s still pretty good! You have found a good way to fill up and satisfy that urge for pizza! The expensive part is worth it. I get satisfied eating _NAME_’s Pesto Tortellini (450 calories), but it’s $4.79 for one frozen dinner. I only get one a week so it’s not like it’s that big a deal. We’re worth a treat!"

Mine told me, as one example, if I fell asleep it would kill me and that this other person I know of died that way cos the voice told me she heard voices too and didn’t listen. Apparently we were both told not to tell anyone or else we would die too. I still wonder sometimes if the hallucinations have the power to kill me, seriously"

I was doing better on a +50% dose but it’s just too expensive for me to buy it every 20 days. Of course, clear the supplements with your pdoc before taking.

176107882,"I know I talk to God and demons and ghosts and stuff but plenty of people do and are just called very spiritual or psychic and not mentally ill. Depends on who you talk to and what their beliefs are. And yes the medication seems to stop the voices and their physical interactions with me but what if their brain altering properties are just reducing my channeling abilities? (Not that that is a bad thing at all-I’d rather not have those abilities at all) Then again there is that whole thing where I thought I was a werewolf princess bounty hunter for 8 years of my life. And then thought I was a being from another dimension and then thought I was God and then thought I was the next messiah and that the devil was after me wanting to impregnate me with the antichrist and then I thought I was a witch for a bit and then started thinking I was something called a “catalyst” that could bring on the end times then thought I was an ancient soul sent here to be a warrior in the apocalypse and then thinking 
maybe I could even be a djinn or something. I can’t ignore that that’s all insane. That’s not a NORMAL part of human experience as far as I know normal people don’t have those beliefs and feelings in their life. And I can’t explain my hallucinations at all either really. The weird colorful lights and the swirling floors and melting walls and vanishing swelling objects and those awful tactile sensations of being abused sexually and physically. I mean maybe you could say the abuse was ghosts or demons but the visual stuff? I don’t get it. At the same time I have dreams where I am fully psychotic and both seeing and hearing terrifying things and that is not me. I don’t know what I am. I’m just weird. All I know is I want the demons and ghosts to leave me alone and I’ll do whatever it takes to shut them up and be out of my life, even if that means taking meds for life and being diagnosed with psychosis. I don’t care I can’t deal with that crap."

176107884,If you are talking to me I went back to school to study Aviation Maintenance Technology. I got my aircraft mechanic licenses. I used to be a pilot. I worked as an aircraft mechanic for 6 months in 2017 but it only paid $15 an hour. I can make a lot more than that with my masters degree so I went back to work working for the government in a field I have no experience in. But the masters degree got me the GS 9 paygrade which is about $25 an hour. I could have made a lot more than that working an aviation job (pilot non flying stuff) but I would have to move. Everything is relative. You can do anything you put your mind to once you’re stable.

176107890,"Fourteen years ago I found out my husband (at the time) molested my children who told them, “Mom knows all about this. If you say anything, she’ll get mad and leave and never come back.” He was a closet alcoholic/cocaine user. When my oldest daughter told me what was happening, I confronted him about the abuse and he tried to kill me. That was the first time I heard “The Voice” since I was a kid, who told me what to say so I could escape. Two years later, both my parents died. A year after that, The Voice came after me for real. It was so terrifyingly vicious, I was afraid to die because I believed what it told me…I was damned for eternity, and it would be even worse for me if I took my own life. The voice took over and I signed myself into the hospital. After a month on the inpatient ward, I lied so they’d release me. Medication didn’t help and it made me nauseous. I started really listening to what it was telling me, and I began to see the flaws in reason. I dethatched from it. I 
went back to school and got a masters degree. My coworkers and friends know nothing about my past. My family acts as if they’ve forgotten what happened.

I mean I guess I prefer it that way but it’s like living like a double life. Negative criticism like a Peanut gallery in my head voices. Feels So exhausting. Also depressing. I think I have to switch up the way I perceive my voices. Like not to ignore them so much, but to think about them and how they affect me, because they just are my thoughts, or quasi thoughts. I also have to remember the voices I hear aren’t real to others, just me. They don’t come from reality. Which is why they don’t make any sense. Although I still think it’s good to question them, and not to derive meaning from them. It’s like I’m a daydreamer or chronic overthinker. I try to go easy on myself all the time, because I know all of this isn’t my fault. It’s no ones fault. Psychosis has gotten better since my Abilify dosage increase. I feel more rooted in reality and wi
thin myself. This I am very grateful for. I do however think my psychosis and depression are linked as mental disorder. I feel pent up energy sometimes esp when stressed. I also feel like I know a secret or something know one else knows. I feel saddened by my condition. I wish I could make it all go away and be mentally healthy. Then I would definitely try and join the military. I dream about being a Navy SEAL. I honor our armed forces and straight admire them. The tenacity and dedication of our military is amazing. I have thought broadcasting - like others know what I am thinking so I police my thoughts, then my imagination invents voices that criticize everything I do, regardless of what I’m doing.
