176007523,"_AT_MENTION_ Those are multi-digit spoof numbers that they use over and over but at this point I would write them down and keep track of five call numbers. I would report this to the police? Idk what they would do for free but I don’t feel comfortable with the police because of the things they’ll likely do because they can. Can police be trolls? Yes. _AT_MENTION_ I don’t pay the bill but it’s up to my parents. It will affect the triple package deal. Phone, internet, cable."
174343603,The other thing is…it might not necessarily be schizophrenia.
174343604,Google min-101 (also known as roluperidone). That’s in the pipeline for negative symptoms.
176007524,"The thing that helps me out the most is, as _AT_MENTION_ has said, do exactly what it is that I dont feel like doing. Most of the time that means I go to a store just to walk around. Especially when I dont want to leave the house."
176007525,Resistant. 15155
176007526,Thank you! Can you tell me where it shows on the scale of antipsychotics how strong the medicine is? I think I might risk the hospital again and take it

176007529,How come its your gp who controls your psychiatric meds? Here only a psychiatrist can. Gp are not qualified and don’t study mental illness. Which country is that?
174343614,I’m starting to wonder if I’m also on the bipolar spectrum coupled with my schizophrenia. Today I feel much better. The delusion that I have become some sort of ‘spectacle’ has drifted away. Or perhaps the Olanzopine I took last night has done the trick?
176007530,The FBI and CIA have much more important things to do like terrorism or monitoring mafia bosses. I am sure you’re not one of those.
174343609,"I’m on 10 mg abilify and i’m constantly restless. I walk around my apartment, often without a reason. Suddenly i rise from the chair, without any purpose, walk in to the kitchen, sit down again etc. I haven’t got restless, shaking legs and the rest of the symptoms, just this, nervous, inner feeling of restlesness. Might this be akathesia?"
174343613,I always feel like I committed the unpardonable sin. Is this a delusion and does anyone else feel this way?

176007534,I don’t know which meds will take that away for you. But I’d like to welcome you to the forum.
176007535,"everyone suffers from something. it just not seen but everyone is crazy!"" almost everyone tells me that. they mean good but I hate it. how are you feel about those words? do you hear that often?"

176007537,I hope to be off meds some day. Could take years or a life time. Some type of government psy-op victim here. I just want to recover and move on. Get better and med free. I want a degree and to be successful. Whatever. Maybe it’s not meant to be?

174343616,"these devices let you have receive government benefits while having assets that would otherwise be above the benefit eligibility requirements. for example, SSI limits people to two thousand dollars assets, but if they have these devices they can get more than that. what are all ya’ll’s thoughts on these devices? especially if you have them or would consider them. i do have an ABLE acccount. i thought about getting a special needs trust to protect my money that I can’t put in an ABLE account. the reason i don’t, is because i am a high functioning schizophrenic, and i may be well enough some day to not need a trust. i could get a temporary trust, but i teeter on the edge of whether i’m well enough, to not want to bother with it right now. for me, i make too much income to qualify for a lot of medicaid assistance, but if i cover my assets, i could still get medicaid for workers with disabilities to help with my medicare payments and such."
174343611,_AT_MENTION_ I had the same issue when I was on other meds. I couldn’t get out of bed. On clozapine I’m up by 0900 usually.
176007545,"Man, I’m meant to sound like me dammit. There’s only one _PERSON_"
176007546,I was seen at first and they gave me antipsychotic medication but didn’t follow up. I ended up being committed after 8 months of everything falling apart and that’s when they finally diagnosed me. I had been diagnosed with Psychosis before but I was only 17 so they avoided the Sz label then.
176007547,"Sometimes I think I have been prescribed, “Years of boredom.” I may need this to clear up all of my confusion. It is a form of treatment. It may work, but I might be wrong."

176007551,When I was an intern architect I was very ambitious but unfortunately once I was prodromal I couldn’t handle the pressure and became full blown psychotic…tried to return a few times back to my old firm designing homes but couldn’t use my graphics anymore because I couldn’t control my hands like I used to before…
176007552,"It increases dopamine, so I found it much more stimulating than SSRI medication. I had insomnia on it, extreme anxiety, erectile dyafunction. I quit after a week on it. Its not a good antidepressant for me. At first i felt high but then turned into anxiety."

174343610,"My parents were caring and concerned, but they had flaws which defeated all their good intentions and conscientious support. I was disappointed in my mother in my later life. My dad always was inexplicable to me. I guess a lot of people have had their share of hard knocks. There are a lot of messed up people out there. One thing I have to say about my dad is that he just could not resist his predilections. He was powerless against them. There are a lot of gays going around knowingly spreading the HIV virus. They have more alternatives and outlets than my dad. I don’t know how far a person can go with the “I can’t help it” defense. There are things I do (They aren’t sexual.) which dumbfound other people. The only defense I have is the “I can’t help it.” defense."
176007554,Usually when I am bad off I become emotionless. Medication has made me sleepy or dazed when it was not the right mixture. I actually thought that I was emotionless when I first started on medication but then I realized that I was actually calm in the head and I could start thinking and having normal emotions because the voices were better. If you don’t feel right definitely talk to your doc.
176007556,You mean like this?
176007557,wd u suggest solution for me ?
176007558,Do you have anybody on your medical team to call first?
176007559,Yes I think that too
176007560,That’s a really good point _AT_MENTION_ . I struggle with men following me because if I mess up they’re going to torture me for info. People tell me it’s not real but they can’t prove it to me.
176007561,also heart race… but im coming off invega so i dont know if the mix caused it…

176007562,my point is we fighters in terms of our minds
176007563,Where do you work and why couldn’t you work more? Are all your symptoms managed with medication? What medications do you take?
176007564,"Awwww, _PERSON_, I’m sorry to hear that. Did she work in an office alone? When a np, pdoc, or therapist leaves, they give notice and introduce him or her to you. You didn’t deserve that."
176007565,"Hope it works for you. I was on 200mg for over 10 years, and all i can say i was ruddy impulsive on the stuff, never mind the metallic taste in the mornings.

176007570,"Get by on as little sleep medication as you can, and then when you see your pdoc they might find a better sleep med. for you. Be careful though, a lot of those things are habit forming."
174343622,"Admittedly, it doesn’t work on 1% of the sz/sza population who take the test."
176007571,Not like me at all. I don’t even know if my schizoaffective or bipolar diagnoses are accurate.
174343624,I was first diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood during my first hospitalization then delusional disorder during my second and then paranoid schizophrenia during my third. They made a big deal about the diagnosis. They called my wife in and there were several mental health professionals in the meeting. My second psychiatrist told me “your diagnosis is paranoid schizophrenia “. I had no idea what the hell he was talking about or what that was so I didn’t have much of a reaction. Then the other psychiatrist in the room told me if I didn’t like that diagnosis she could change it to PTSD. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t think I was sick the first 7 years but I finally figured it out and that’s what it was all along. I have never had any mood issues so I think it’s pretty accurate. The VA would later add chronic to it but still paranoid schizophrenia. Now I understand it’s just schizophrenia. Psychiatry isn’t an exact science. My fourth hospitalization the doctor sai
d I had psychotic disorder NOS so I guess it could be that too but schizophrenia has stuck with over 7 different psychiatrists so I go with that. I don’t get hung up on it. It’s just a label that I don’t disclose to anyone so only people really close to me know anything about it.

176007577,"Take a shower and get dressed in warm clothes and do some light exercises. Then get yourself involved in something interesting like a hobby, or work."
176007578,"Hello. Yes. I have taken zyprexa a long time, and I have been able to work in some capacity most of the time. Zyprexa keeps my symptoms of psychosis away which is essential to be able to function. I have been taking 5mg daily for a long time now. I was on 10mg before that, then it was very difficult to work because i got too much sideeffects. People could see that something was not quite right about me. I can still get that if I start working early, so I found the best option for me was to work in a shop that opens later in the day (10am), that way I get rid of the worst sideeffects before I start to work. I found it was difficult to communicate on 10mg, it’s better now on 5. I also find it helps to have healthy habits for the brain. Avoid anything that gives me brainfog like spending too much time on internet/tv, solving mind puzzles and supplementing with herbs and vitamins to counteract the sideeffects of the drug."
174343630,"Negative symptoms are real, ppl don’t want to believe in them because they don’t have it and because there is no meds yet for them. “Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn’t make eye contact, doesn’t change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.” https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-_PHONE_NO_"

176007588,"Uh, maybe not. I’m not allowed to tell my wife’s organic cousin and her family how bad they smell (like _PERSON_ cheese having an off day). There’s no health fad they won’t embrace and they were doing the whole no shower/bathing thing to restore their natural bacteria. Complete case of smell you later. So glad we rarely see/smell them now. Feel badly for their son, I’m sure he gets teased at school over it."

176007597,I feel a lot better. My symptoms were really bad from 2008 till 2016 and I was on two antipsychotics and I still heard voices. I am now on just a 5 mg haldol pill and no longer hear voices and I think I made quite a bit of improvement from my 20s. I believe in a few years it will be even better. Hopefully one day I can become med free!

Nothing has ceased them completely. Nothing I wonder will help, or hinder. Reality still melts, and it was probably my own fault. The tribunal is watching in silence, hands pushing, and hands enticing. It’s all their call, and I can feel them as stalwart sentinels. So many tests, they’ve changed me. That’s the point. Burn away the impurities, and you are left with condensed soul. Oblivion. Such a sweet word. Call and dance to the void, let yourself echo in harmony to a beat. Announce yourself to the dark. Stand tall, and stand firm."

176007611,Satanic stuff lol
176007612,"Without entering into politics, what are you guys opinions on the relevance of the abandonment of the notion of truth for psychotic mental health? Would you say it liberates us from oppressing thought police that designates delusions as wrong beliefs? Such that we can be our more authentic selves? Or is the postmodern affliction a disaster to mental health by taking away the criterion that validates the suffering of the deluded?"
176007613,That’s interesting !
176007614,I dont know. You could call a pharmacist and hope they have that in their system. I’m always afraid they won’t have data on interactions.

176007616,Good luck _AT_MENTION_ Yeah I’ve been counting my calories also.
176007617,Not sure if this is due to sza or not.
176007618,Having a college degree doesn’t prove intelligence. Some people do far better out there than in college. I think I personally would have done better in a vocational course. Something like an apprenticeship.

176007632,Not sure. hallucinations can seem pretty real at times.
176007633,"In my case, its not the meds folks… Long before the diagnosis, i learned to sleep a lot… Ive also was weak and dead like for long… Now, i work on my mind, but i still get the oversleeping and the lack of energy… I also suffer from cognitive deficits and i think its all a symptom along with the lack of energy lol… Even my sister called me a zombie once… I seem dead like tbh and most of the people see me as depressed, but the docs are sure its sz though… I guess just that its rarer for a sz to be so dead like lol… Yeap, my sz was often quite in the ‘‘low’’… What kind of sz is this in fact? To always want to sleep etc? Its negatives or what? Who else was like this too? Did you get better on the oversleeping etc?.. Also, what are the effects on a normie if he sleeps for 16 hours? He’ll be loose too or what?"
176007634,"I started on 200mg amisulpride in hospital then it went up to 400mg soon after. That was in 2013. Been prescribed 400mg ever since but I’ve been taking only 200mg nowadays as it’s my minimum dose without breaking the bank. But when I have episode which occasionally happens even on 200mg, I raise it to 300mg. When I relapsed in past and needed to go to hospital they pushed it up to 400mg which made me better. So now if I relapse I just do it myself and raise it to 300/400mg amisulpride. This should keep me out of hospital in future"
176007635,But without meds I am stupid too because of paranoia. High dopamine? How to have normal dopamine levels then?
176007636,I have no experience with shots. I suppose you can try it and see how it goes. If you feel it helps you good. If you feel something unpleasant that could be a interaction you should stop and see if it passes.
176007637,"Good for you, partial hospitalization helps immensely, Enjoy the education and support you get from there. It’s priceless!"
176007638,Yeah hes impossible to get ahold of that’s why I’m writing it here. He would probably say it’s too soon to say and keep taking Prozac. I find I do better when I manage the meds myself. I’m considering going back on the injections. I talk to him on the phone once every three months. I don’t know when My next appointment is. I should call him but its friday and I won’t be able to until monday. I may tell him about my panic attack in rehab and that I dont think Prozac is working.
174343637,"hi, welcome back =) i’m on clozapine and risperdal consta… that combo is really well for me. I feel better than i did in long time… some days are harder than others but at least my positive symptoms are under control now."

176007643,Try not to worry _AT_MENTION_ . You can contact your pdoc on Monday and ask them about your meds.
176007644,Mine don’t really have a story line as such some say they are the devil and are taking me to hell others are the government then I just have regular annoying voices. They do talk to each other at night and when I’m doing things that I’m not supposed to be doing but it is all very jumbled up so can’t make out what they are saying to each other.

176007662,For many years I experienced a repeated sexual abuse that was happening to me in my mind. It was awful. I thought I wouldn’t live through it. I almost didn’t. I feel terrible for you. The best advice I can give you is for you to get into therapy immediately with an experienced therapist and be as honest and open as you can be about what’s going on with you. Together you can work through this in a safe way. I wish you health and peace.

174343645,"Oh yeah its better to see a psychiatrist, psychologists are not qualified to treat schizophrenia here in Canada. Psychiatrists have much more training in treating mental illnesses and the most effective treatment of schizophrenia is meds prescribed by psychiatrists, antipsychotics.

They let you have a house and a car (no value limit I think) but how does one pay for the expensive car registration/renewal, property tax, utilities, gas, maintenance, etc. It makes no sense whatsoever.

I’m wondering what kind of med’s you’re taking. Haldol is one drug I really don’t care for, but for a few others it is a miracle drug. It handles their symptoms with few side effects. For me, Geodon and Seroquel handle my symptoms with very few side effects. Keep trying different med’s. If the atypicals don’t work, try the typicals, and vice versa.

174343655,_PERSON_ they don’t fully know the mechanism but they know a good part. I learned in my psychology courses that sz brains start to shrink in the parietal lobes which are responsible for sensory information processing. For some the shrinking also develops in the frontal lobes which causes negative symptoms because their function is task execution and planning.

176007706,"This year I have volunteered 70 hours at a fish farm (a hatchery). I cleaned the ponds with waders on, in 4ft deep water and fish poo with a long brush. I mowed the lawn, hedge trimmed over 100ft of juniper, picked bad eggs out with a gravity operated vacuum sucker, checked intake during a flood, stacked wood, weeded, got to drive the club car, removed brush and foliage, sprayed for weeds, trimmed ferns, cleaned shop, pretty much anything and everything. They staff are really nice there. Very professional and hard workers. I got along with them great. A snippet from my journal: Today I am nearing the completion of my court mandated community service hours. This has been an honor to serve my community. A special thank you to the stewards of The Hatchery and ODFW. I will continue to shape my work ethic to the standards you put forth. I found God today. :’) happy tears I also have volunteered recently at my church. I helped serve Easter breakfast for six hours. Then served our last community dinner

176007711,"That’s not okay. If he’s so pissed, then he should rearrange your stuff, hide your phone charger, dumb sh it like that. But purchasing something that could not only hinder your recovery, but make you ill as well? Are you absolutely certain that this is the guy that you want to spend the rest of your life with? This time, it’s the snacks; whatever, I know, but this sort of behavior tends to escalate. What happens next time he gets pissed? Will he secretly give you marijuana? Will he flush your meds? Will he confirm your obsessions and delusions? Will he gaslight you to the point where you end up in the hospital again? If buying sweets that trigger your eating disorder is the sort of punishment he feels justified in giving to you, then you seriously need to ask yourself what he’s capable of, and whether or not being with this man is safe."

176007713,"If the rules there are anything like the rules here, they are not allowed to restrict your access to your own private property. They may leave the phone in a locked area when you aren’t using it, so it stays safe from the other kids. But if you ask for it, they would have to give it to you. The only way they could take it from you without your consent is if your parents donated the phone to the group home with the caveat that you be allowed to use it at certain times. We never restricted the kids from using the house phone whenever they wanted, and usually encouraged them to make at least one phone call every day. If you live in a home with a lot of phone traffic, there might be a limit of how long you can use the phone at any one time. That is only if the laws governing group homes are the same in your country as in my state. Things might be different there, but if they are, I would imagine it would err on the side of more personal freedoms, rather than less."

176007716,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I have been lucky with customers since I started working for myself so far, but this is a real lesson learned.

Not only do you need to get high you need to do it alone so nobody finds you and brings you down. The chances of od is way too high. Do it on the street corner someone’s gonna call ems and bring you down. Do it it alone you risk loosing your life. Its a trap, nothing good happens in the trap."

176007728,"It sounds like he/she is either a bad case manager not doing his/her job or maybe they don’t understand what you want, maybe the person is not clear as to what you want. It might be up to you to light a fire under his ass to get him moving and do his/her job and help you. My physical doctor is an indian woman who is really nice and always seems happy to see me and I like her. Way back in March she refered me to a specialist to look at my kidney function. The referal should have been an easy process that takes a couple of weeks to finalize and get the paperwork straight. But there were miscommunications between her and the specialist and after more than 30 phone calls between me and both of them , I was no more closer to getting seen than when I first started. In the mean time I had talked to at least 10 other periphial nurses and workers at certain times every month since March about this. This is known as “falling through the cracks”. Finally, by a stroke of good luck I got the right help. M
y nephew has a good job at a large business firm and just coincidentily his company’s benefits gives free aid to him, and any relative of his who was having problems like I was having. So he gave them my sisters names and a worker called my sisters to arrange for them to help me. It turns out I started corresponding with the woman via e-mail and she turned out to be really nice and after two weeks she made calls to by doctor and the clinic and cut through all the bull and after 7 months I finally had my doctors appointment. It was bad news but at least now I can start treating my health problem. I’m sorry this is so long, my point is coming up. I also have had a nice caseworker of my own for these past four years. He’s helped me in many ways, in fact he found this apartment for me. He’s a good guy but I’ve always felt he was kind of a minor bulls*iter who doesn’t quite know what he’s doing all the time and he’s from New York and just kind of wings it as he goes along using whatever he learned 
while running in the streets in his youth. But again, when we started wotking together it started off nice and I saw him a lot but then since I am fairly stable we arranged instead of seeing him once a week, that we would get together only once a month through a phone call or in person. But I barely heard from him. If I didn’t call him occasionally, then I would never hear from him except in a couple of emergencies. This is how it has been for the past two years. Finally, just a month ago I was having trouble with neighbors and it was impacting other parts of my life so he called a meeting with him, my sisters, my therapist, and a counselor and we cleared up some crap. My long point is that we have to force these guys to help us. If we act like we don’t care about ourselves they won’t care either. Case workers, therapists, psychiatrists etc. can be the nicest people but they’re only human and nice people make mistakes too and they might have a huge caseload of other clients and so if a client is less 
vocal than others he/she can get lost in the shuffle and pushed aside and forgotten about. I don’t know if this describes you but I learned that I have to demand services and make my presence known. “The squeaky wheel gets the grease.” We are not to blame for bad caseworkers but it’s either we go around them or over them to get our needs met."
176007729,is that due to our sickness? Or is this just a bad personality trait.
176007730,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Guys can we maybe be a little more careful about telling people to stop getting treatments from mental health professionals? I know this seems bad, but we have little info and the default response should not be “stop seeing them”."
174343663,"You and me both, what I’d give to be able to have a cup of tea and some soothing classical music at 9 PM and daintily lay down in bed at 10 PM after brushing and gently drift off to sleep, but it’s like my mind is always playing heavy metal in the background and a part of me is always amped. I live with insomnia because I can’t sleep unless I crash from exhaustion. I have schizoaffective disorder, as opposed to schizophrenia, so mania might be part of it. I envy my grandparents’ bedtime routine. I just can’t have a “bed time” because I lie awake staring at the ceiling. Sorry, this probably isn’t a very helpful reply, just wanted you to know I have trouble with it too. I’ve found limited success using YouTube videos of calming ocean sounds and keeping that on while I try to fall asleep."

I’m on the computer on my couch not making a sound. And I just keep hearing a peal of laughter every time I relax. I test it out. It is timed so perfect to drive me crazy and make me mad. How do I know this? Because it’s been two years. I stop and listen, I try not to jump to conclusions. But I see these people several times a day or more as they walk by my window and they hang out in the carport where I park my car. They go back and forth constantly. They know what they’re doing."

It can be anything from foster care, immigration, or any other social issue and its injustices (or your argument for how it is just). I’m thinking of doing mine on the treatment of the mentally ill. I just dont know what I should focus on. Should I focus on how many are in jail when they should be in treatment centers? Should i focus solely on _USER_ID_? Or maybe I can focus on the history of mental health treatment, where we are now, and where I feel we need to go? Any ideas would be great!"
176007751,Sounds like depression and your suffering. What meds do you take? You are only looking at life from a very narrow perspective and it’s not normal to think like that. Can you discuss this with your treatment team? It’s not bad to recognize you need some help with getting through life.

176007759,I feel this way about Phenibut. Dont let it get to you. Have a drink every now and then if it doesn’t hurt you. If it becomes a habit then that’s a problem.
176007760,"Yes, they’re just guessing. Most MI diagnosis’s are a guessing game since they really don’t know how they happen or what causes them. That’s why finding the right medication can be frustrating."
176007762,Benzo withdrawal is horrible.
176007763,I find visits with extended family pretty stressful. But with my _PERSON_ and Dad I am ok. Actually I find they are the easiest people to get on with that I know.
176007764,I take Invega Sustenna injections and have no sex drive from them but it’s a small price to pay for staying sane.
176007765,Had my first psychosis during my 2nd semester in university. It brought my grades down by a lot but I still passed and got my degree.
176007766,_AT_MENTION_ Are you not on meds for Sz? Or did you recover from Sz? I also have Major Depressive Disorder. It’s really bad.
176007767,"We all mess up from time to time. I occasionally do weed, even though i’m not supposed to. Don’t beat yourself up. You’ve done a good job to not smoke any until the 3rd."
176007768,"My voices is kind of like thinking in someone else’s voice. They are normal in how loud they are but I still feels like someone else placed them there. Furthermore, I guess the best way to put it is like an invisible gun and Everytime someone pulls the trigger i have a bad thought…"
176007769,And another thing is it’s good to have a routine one can keep to.
176007770,I hope she is right. It sounds like years would be much better than months.
176007771,Climbed to the roof of four storey hospital and started shouting …
174343666,I just saw this commercial for the first time in the US but not on Youtube yet.
176007772,"Understood. The Mods do a pretty good job of ridding this site of Trolls, though."
176007773,"I have often found the problem with pdocs as that they treat my experiences in sz as ?delusions?. To them, psychosis is something that I can just ignore once others tell me that it is not ?real?. But to me, it is experienced as thoughts in my head that I didnt think. Essentially being God, Devil, a government chip, or other people with telepathic ability. Mine was the the devil. But, almost always, the pdocs telling us that are people who have never experienced sz themselves. What they have learned about sz in their life, they have learned from authors and teachers who have spoken with other szs but also decided that anything the sz tells them about that experience is ?just a delusion?. So they have judged the reality of it before actually hearing it."
176007774,I just want to be donated to science. When they’re done with the body they cremate what’s left and send it back to the family.
176007775,does it work? im kinda curious.
176007776,Lol piggy food means junk food in the uk.
176007777,Yesterday 151515
176007778,What country are you from? The US?
176007779,i just smoke ciggrattes now. the bad voices have reduced… but cant figure out what do they actually want
176007780,Found your thread! Glad you’re changing! Also glad you have a prn! What’s your Propranolol dose?
176007781,Not as much. Either that or I’ve just gotten use to it.
174343670,You’re the one not believing in positive and negative symptoms that psychiatrists use. These are proven scientifically on all schizophrenics in the world and are in the DSM-5. You have feelings of anti psychiatry.
176007782,Could be your weight or it could be the meds.
174343664,"thought broadcasting, i had quite a huge experience upon this subject. even a few days back i had the “relapse”. Good medication really helps, but most importantly it’s your thinking (mindset) there was a time when i had meds but i still felt my thoughts were broadcasted, so if you want a good effective solution to this issue would be to take meds and to instill good values and mindset for yourself. initially, i thought my thought broadcasting was me talking without me knowing but i used my webcam and video capture myself in front of my computer for 1 to 2 mins, and i re-view it myself. The truth? i did not see my lips moving nor my head moving about that looked like i spoke anything for the whole 2 mins. so… conclusion after this test: theoretically proven impossible, due to the fact that my lips did not move, body language showed no signs of possible vocal expressions. solution for me: To view at this issue with logic and reasonings. i ever tried explaining how thought broadcasting affect 
me to one of my colleagues, so i told her, an analogy that why we schizophrenia felt that our thoughts can be linked to radio station, (i was working in a petrol pump station), so i told her saying for example “petrol station”, after 3 seconds the radio guy said “coupons” which then i told her, here is how we linked, we linked by coupon and petrol station because by normal means petrol stations gives out coupons to attract customers to buy more so to let them earn more. But due to this “linked,” we somehow felt that the radio knew our thoughts, but it’s just “superbly coincidence that is out of the world for us schizophrenia” our ability to link between things (common area) is our cause to this brokenness, but yet if you use it in a good way (the way of the normal), we can easily find a lot of common grounds between a lot of things. So in short, it’s our weakness yet our strength and due to this fact it’s working as a double-edged sword to us. so to recap, good meds and good values helps 
^^ _NAME_ aka lordarous"
176007783,thanks _AT_MENTION_ Yes there is 50mg Vit B5 in it. What benefits have you felt for taking B vitamins for 20 years?
176007784,I like the splodgy effect you create with your painting. Looks effective.
176007785,_AT_MENTION_ - 32 is still young. You have lots of time to get stuff done.
176007786,My voices threatened to kill me through the brain chip in my head and gave me a massive headache. Take the right meds and they have no power over you.
174343677,"Hey all. I went off my meds in April and it’s been a downhill spiral since then. Ended up back in the hospital, and am now back on Abilify and Effexor. I’m working again full time as a waitress (my contract with the Health Authority is over, but I did some good work advocating for my schizo fam!) and I think I might have met the love of my life! She has sza depressive type, and I love her so very much. All in all, I think I’m doing much better now. My next pdoc appointment is on Monday, so fingers crossed that he agrees I’m on the right track! Lots of love <3 _NAME_"
174343665,"It’s not new I tried it back around 2012. Did nothing for me. But it’s weird they’re doing commercials this late on it. It’s been out for quite a bit, cause it was out at least 5 years before I tried it. Wonder if they got an ingredient change and got to renew patent and are now pushing it. I know I only paid 5 bucks a month for 90 pills, but that was back then. If it got any changes that price is gonna jump again."
176007787,"I’m always tired. Sorry, If I’m not on here as much. I try to be as active as much as I can."
176007788,"My old case manager used to do this to me all the time. It actually took a doctor to step in and help me. She refused to let me see a doctor and I had to complain. I was on Latuda and I had akathisia and she told me to just get over it. She even went to the lengths of getting a pharmacist to prescribe me a beta blocker in the end, but the doctor refused it and suddenly I got treatment in the form of several med changes."
176007789,"Too bad, they have to know the secret handshake"
176007790,"Thank you. I agree. I’m just sensitive about getting too much advice without trying some things on my own, at least at first. MI sucks and I feel incompetent about so much and I think I’m doing a really good job. I am definitely going to do everything to take care of my dog and keep him. I guess it’s good to know I’m not alone at the end of the day."
176007791,I’d try this only with my invega 234mg.
176007792,"Not so much, but maybe reality is and has always been reality, no offense, then you lose the programming delusion lol"
176007793,Best of luck with the move.
176007794,"The advices by you are good dear folks. But It’s not easy to stop smoking tobacco and not drinking as these things have such a big role in my life. If i would be rich enough, these wouldn’t be my problems in the first place."
176007795,What are sour soothers like. At least I know they are sour. Are they like gummy bears or are they hard candy? Do you live in the US?
176007796,I would ask for the injection today to be safe.
176007797,Very lifelike _AT_MENTION_ ! You got the proportions just right! Well done!
176007798,I rarely masturbaite
176007799,nothing to say…just good luck.I did stopped antipsychotic for quite some time and just got back on it…i sleep better
176007800,_AT_MENTION_ How much was prescribed to you? Take one for now in the meantime you find how much is prescribed. Call your Dr to find out how much you need.
176007801,It hugely raises your chances especially before age 18 Still very concerning after Everyone who has had psychosis can relapse straight away Especially anything strong
176007802,Who is keeping me alive while I dream if that’s all I’m doing?
176007803,I’m wishing you all the best pianogal. Hope you find some relief.
176007804,"I’m not always tired, but I have no motivation. I just lie in the bed all the time. I’m usually tired in the morning after sleeping if I sleep. I had to force myself to get up and do some things today. It’s nearly 3pm, and I’m back to lying in the bed. I don’t feel tired, just a little depressed."
176007805,How do they do that to you? Do they phone you constantly?
176007806,I’m happy for you buddy.
174343672,I would like to be successful in life; my interests are more-so in art and writing. I found that college right now will be too much; especially trying to figure out the online system. In college I studied mass communications and did well. But I really wanted to study art–was told it would be too competitive. So right now I will try to stay positive in my confidence and grounded in reality. So far what I know is the best thing is to take it one day at a time. I am thinking of writing another book; hopefully the inspiration will come back.
176007807,I think I am 41 but my memory is a bit bad sometimes.
176007808,I see yes you shouldnt take meds you dont need. Do they have withdrawal?
176007809,The government pays for studies to get a desired result…and simply pooh-poohs the results they don’t agree with.
176007810,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m so glad you have your art! I did those things because I should, not because I felt like it."
176007811,"Thank you. I really wish I could feel what I say, think, show others. It seems to be an important quality to have. I’ve come a long way, I know that."
176007812,I wrote my exam just days ago. Also I have work during the day. Good evening! Please note that I am awfully tired…
176007813,Positive _NAME_! I like it.
176007814,"candy corn is good too, nice choice."
176007815,Thanks for that work of art with the relevant lyrics.
176007816,im addicted to adaptogens now now taking ashwagandha 600mgs and rhodeola rosea 500mgs going to buy a third one whenever i can afford it lol both cost me 10$ each for a 30 day supply
176007817,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ I hope you are feeling bit better
176007818,Sorry you are having a tough day _AT_MENTION_ . Maybe stay with someone until you feel safe. I am sorry you are feeling afraid. I feel fearful because I experience some of things you said but I still go out to get coffee and go grocery shopping. This Sunday I am going to church. Try to keep busy and distract yourself. I used to have panic and anxiety attacks on a daily basis. It was horrible. But these days I try to keep stress at a minimum and living with my sister helps.
176007819,"Yes, no worries. And I’ve been cutting my own hair during the pandemic."
176007820,"I made it last week, i dont know If I made it right, but it was special."
176007821,I smell similar to rotten eggs .
176007822,"Yes, we have a small amount of money with disability. But not enough to live with them. Should I see another psychiatrist?"
176007823,"Hmm?. Your Wish Is My Command. Hope, True Love, Honesty, Joy, And Eternal Peace!."
174343675,Okay so… this is my first thread ever so I’m kind of nervous. Basically I’m taking 2mgs of Risperidone for my Borderline Personality Disorder (I don’t have sz). I barely have any side effects other than low motivation/drive which I’m trying to get rid of since over a year. I tried Abilify which made me anxious as hell and my girlfriend didn’t want me to take it anyway since the paper in the blister pack lists “sudden unexplained death” as a possible side effect with unknown frequency - at least here in Germany. Then exactly a year ago I took Citalopram but just for a short while because I was afraid of getting PSSD from it. It’s been a _USER_ID_ ride. But I really want to do something about it so today I emailed my pdoc if it is okay to take Citalopram again since I have a few left of them and see how it goes on my next appointment on 11th November. She is fine with it so… Tomorrow I’m adding it to my Risperidone. I know everyone reacts differently to every med but I’m still 
interested in what your experiences are. Also did you have sexual problems at certain doses? Thanks in advance!
176007824,Mostly Australians online now lol
176007825,"Its like in war I have heard from many people that have experienced war. When people are refugees you would think the are preoccupied with running from the war and getting shot. Instead, what I have heard people do in that situation is the start ???????"
176007826,I just bought l carnitine capsules for my severe anhedonia. Just read on the internet about a study showing that oral administration of l carnitine is similar to placebo. Do you have any experience with taking l carnitine orally?
176007827,I’ll check on Canadian amazon
176007828,Look at all your meds and just want to take them all at once? I struggle with this often.
176007829,"My IQ is low, under 70 but I think my social ability is much higher. I am a surviver."
176007830,Idk much about sza but aren’t ssri for depressive type and mood stabilizers for manic type?
176007831,"Mac and cheese, pasta _NAME_ (I like broccoli in them too…yum!)"
176007832,"But I’m ok. After having less than 1200 calories yesterday I thought I would wake up really hungry but I’m ok. I ate an egg and a piece of bread and that was plenty. So even though I took that diet pill many hours ago it’s still in my system and working. I’m so happy. I planned out my food for the day on myfitnesspal.com and everything looks good for today. I just really need to get to the grocery store for some fresh fruits and veggies, that would really help."
176007833,"Well, the only problem is, my mother is hiding my psychosis from my brother because she believes my illness will shock my brother and/or bring shame to my family. As a result I rarely tell my mother about my problems."
174343688,Same too lol the second time I tried it.
176007834,"I appreciate that, i think that would be a helpful option. Its so easy with otc drugs to just go to walmart or shoppers at 2 am."
176007835,_PERSON_… That’s kinda cute
176007836,Good for you _AT_MENTION_!
176007837,"Maybe you just have mild sz and don’t need meds? Its like when I was years before my diagnosis, mild symptoms and I didn’t need meds back then. I think maybe sz can stay in the prodromal phase for a long time or forever."
176007838,You will suffer one hell of a withdrawal with that.
176007839,Yea I’m a millennial I used to date all the time but since I’ve been feeling better I’m lost
176007840,You can probably save them by removing the foil and sticking them under the broiler for one minute.
176007841,Thankyou guys 151515
176007842,You deserve to have good memories and thoughts. But if they are distressing to you you may want to try cbt. I hope you feel better _AT_MENTION_ and you deserve happiness

176007849,"ah yeah fair enough. hmmm , id recommend doing 20 mins of moderate exercise so you can get an endorphin rush. it will make you feel better in the short term"
176007850,_AT_MENTION_ thank you for your blessing
176007851,Sounds good _AT_MENTION_ . I just did a wedding down the coast. It was 2 hours away in another state but actually went to the beach. Beaches are always nice and I’d imagine they are pretty spectacular over there. Might pay to look for some local art galleries. We often have hidden little local artist galleries. Might not be the appeal of a major gallery but art is always worth a look at least for me. $500 a night I’d want bathe in champagne or something similarly expensive! haha. When do you go and for how long?
176007852,"Okay, thanks for the feedback."
174343679,Interesting caplyta has potential to help severe or treatment resistant patients. Just read it. So far I’m doing good. 6th day strong.

174343692,"That didnt work for me, my therapist tried but he failed. I am not disorganized and never been disorganized."
176007854,"Do you get overwhelmed by the problems around you? In fact, i am very stressed, anxious and paranoid person… The meds help very few on this … BUt i have ill friends who are desperate and i get very paranoid when i listen to problems. I am freezed and blocked in my activity in fact so i cant help much no one, but i feel very guilty about it . Its the same around my mother… She cries a lot, is with her bad nerves now and i get very paranoid when its like this… Why i am like this??? Anyone else who get very overwhelmed by the smallest problems too??? I need a lot of positivity now in my life, but i guess the life its not only this… I also get paranoid when the others shout at me or criticize me… Idk why i went so sensible. My psychosomatics goes to the roof when theres some tragedy or problems and they are quite painful. I lose even the ability to stand on my feet by fear … I’ll try to fight, but yeap, i cant deal with problems…"
176007855,"I feel like this sometimes, like I can’t stop moving. I thought it might of been the voices from my sz but I think it might be someone messing me up."
174343681,I’m on my recovery from my second episode last December. I used to binge drink sometimes and I once did mdma. I am planning in coming off meds some point if my absence of positive symptoms continues. I gt at least one uncle whose experienced psychosis
176007856,That’s how it is for me too.
174343690,Making things is not my forte. Does it help?
176007857,Been in two extremely unhealthy relationships. Both ended in psychosis. I’m 31
176007858,Love that dark matter link. I always love to learn about the universe and how it was made
176007859,Have you researched this? Mixing drugs that work on the same receptors can be dangerous.
176007860,Let’s just say I don’t like the way a certain UK party has scapegoated the disabled and poor for the 2008 recession with it’s austerity policies. The stress caused by this to people with severe mental illness is not conducive to good mental health .
176007861,Also with pain here. I am sorry that you are going through this as well… pain is so so tough. Please hang in there. Do you see a pain specialist?
176007862,"Idk man, there alot question still need be answered, that mystery of it. have a good day."
174343693,"It’s the best one for me, no side effects, I’ve lost weight - it doesn’t stimulate my appetite and my symptoms are better controlled. It seems to have helped my negative symptoms too. Everyone responds to drugs differently - the only way to know is to try."
176007863,well I love it all…we eat chinese with mom once a month…first I get california rolls with wasabi and soy …then the boiled cabbage and sauteed mushrooms…then the hot and sour soup and then egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce with chinese mustard…then dessert…haha…it’s a buffet but I always get the same thing.
176007864,"I often feel I have no love to give. I think you’re better off than me, _AT_MENTION_"
176007865,Very nice and soothing!
176007866,You can’t beat yourself up over this failure. Pick yourself up and try again tomorrow. I lost a lot of weight years ago eating what I wanted but just eating a lot less of it. I didn’t have a cheat day. Instead of a whole piece of pie I’d take 2 or 3 bites. I lost a lot of weight that way. Also I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . 3500 calories is like 1500 calories over normal daily allotment so make it up over the next week. You’ll be fine
176007867,It’s not worth it. Talk to your pdoc
176007868,"Good catch, _AT_MENTION_ . _AT_MENTION_ I edited your last name out. Please don’t share it online! Stay safe."

176007872,"A few thoughts on this… If you spend a bunch of your own money advertising someone else’s brand, you’re doing it backwards. They should be paying YOU to put their name out there. It’s not like you’re getting extra quality for all that $$$ you spend, too many of these companies manufacture their crap by exploiting poor workers in foreign sweat shops with no labour code. I’m a sweats and t-shirt guy when I’m working from home. Might as well be comfy. I’m a jeans and t-shirt guy when I go out most times because that’s as dressy as I get. UNLESS _USER_ID_ _PERSON_ is showing me off to her professional colleagues and expects me to wear a suit and tie (ugh). For work clothes, I spend half the day with Calliope (my kitty) climbing up and down me with her claws out, leaving little scratches everywhere. It’s not that she’s being mean, she just doesn’t want to slip. It’s the nature of blood thinners that I ooze for up to an hour before each scratch finally clots and my clothes have 
small little bloodstains everywhere that are difficult to completely launder out as a result. Do I patronize the $1 shirt bin at Salvation Army for this reason? Darn right I do. Would be silly to let the cat claw up and then stain the heck out of $50 “designer” t-shirts. I do prefer certain brands for value/quality/durability. Merrell shoes for example. Wind River fall and winter clothing for another. I have a Wind River hoodie I bought when I was 16 that still works for my kid 35 years later. FInally, people who are impressed by something as silly as what brand of clothes I wear are not people I need in my social circle. I want to spend my time tossing ideas back and forth with other creatives. They’re my tribe. (Well, them and AA members.)"

176007881,As long as you can afford it I see no reason why not.
176007882,"I don’t want to admit it a lot but I think I got schizophrenia and sometimes it feels like insanity: doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. On top of that I had bizarre and crazy dissociation, which I sort of cured with supplements over time. Part of me thinks it was brain damage. I think there’s a small pop of schizophrenics with insanity. I think I had it but it’s mild now. It’s like treatment resistant form and severe case. It gives me access to various aspects of reality and the universe, which feels very real sometimes. Stuff like past lives that most people don’t understand. Not that I was a King in a past life or something lol, but I keep reliving 2011 over and over again with schizophrenia and the same events, life unfolding in similar, but not exact ways like eternal recurrence on sterioids and butterfly effect (quantum). I figure we live in a computer program that has been repeating itself for eternity. That much I figured out. If I got cured, mayb

It got harder in that I notice that co-workers are quietly dumping more on me and hoping the boss doesn’t notice. The more they dump on me, the more they can visit with each other in the office. That’s not going to fly as the boss can see who is doing what in our broker management app on her dashboard. But, it’s stressful. The communication issues (or lack thereof) aren’t helping, and the temptation to log in and work when I’m off is pretty overpowering."

And sadly - all stem cell based treatments have not progressed very quickly… The good news is that California voted to put another $5 Billion into research for stem cell based therapies… so its still progressing: Voters in California have approved US$5.5 billion in funding for stem-cell and other medical research, granting a lifeline to a controversial state agency.

You are most welcome and free to share what is troubling you. Know that though, we are oriented on recovery, focused on supporting each other and ways we can not only find it easier to live with symptoms, but also improve our lives… or at least really improve our chances of living. Truth is, may of us who suffer with a diagnosed mental illness have had delusions or paranoid thoughts of being watched, usually it stems from a delusion of grandeur. The delusion of grandeur sometimes begin when a person feels lonely and unnoticed. Then some of us (note: not all) feel this need to be noticed, a sort of subconscious call for attention. No one wants to feel alone. And then somehow to those who do know us, this feeling of superiority begins, usually when one thinks of that it sounds so negative, but what the feeling projects is this feeling of someh
ow making more of a difference than those around you, or as if you have something that can save the world, but only you. Then you feel watched and are afraid people are following you. The truth is, if you are doing nothing wrong, you don’t have much to worry about. Oh and dun worry, not all of us experience that and some do for a time, in a different order or the same order, the thing is, delusions are based on individual. So… what I mean is… why would people be watching you? Are you the only telepath? Is your telepathy somehow greater? Truthfully, telepathy has only empirically been proven to exist with the use of an external apparatus."

174343719,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov In the eye of the beholder? Oxytocin effects on eye movements in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, V Bell, A Coutrot, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Dec 2019 10 Individuals with schizophrenia have difficulty in extracting salient information from faces. Eye-tracking studies have reported that these individuals demonstrate reduced exploratory viewing behaviour (i.e. reduced number of fixations and shorter scan paths) compared to healthy controls. Oxytocin has previously been demonstrated to exert pro-social effects and modulate eye gaze during face exploration. In this study, we tested whether oxytocin has an effect on visual attention in patients with schizophrenia.Nineteen male participants with schizophrenia received intranasal oxytocin 40UI or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover fashion during two visits separated by seven days. They engaged in a free-viewing eye-tracking task, exploring images of Caucasian men displaying angry, 
happy, and neutral emotional expressions; and control images of animate and inanimate stimuli. Eye-tracking parameters included: total number of fixations, mean duration of fixations, dispersion, and saccade amplitudes.We found a main effect of treatment, whereby oxytocin increased the total number of fixations, dispersion, and saccade amplitudes, while decreasing the duration of fixations compared to placebo. This effect, however, was non-specific to facial stimuli. When restricting the analysis to facial images only, we found the same effect. In addition, oxytocin modulated fixation rates in the eye and nasion regions.This is the first study to explore the effects of oxytocin on eye gaze in schizophrenia. Oxytocin had enhanced exploratory viewing behaviour in response to both facial and inanimate control stimuli. We suggest that the acute administration of intranasal oxytocin may have the potential to enhance visual attention in schizophrenia."

176008019,What I’m saying is if it’s sz the alternatives without meds aren’t good. So it could be a number of things related to psychosis but as I say. It’ll work itself out. Stressing out about outcomes doesn’t really help because if it is something like sz then stress makes symptoms worse…it gets to a catch 22. Honestly I don’t know because I don’t know your clinical history but have some faith in your medical team. Most things they have seen before.

174343725,"Hello. I make a lot of research of google. It gets an “obsession”… I write "" dimethylglycine "" , "" sarcosine "" , "" phosphatidylserine "" and I look for studies for carcinogenicity It’s a big problem… I would like to test but I saw studies on google which are contradictory… For dimethyglycine, a person ( _PERSON_ ) said the mutagenicity was caused by unconsommed nitrites. Another, 10 years before in 1980 ( _PERSON_ ) said the mutagenicity was caused by dimethylglycine. A work in "" Cancer and nutrition"" said it causes cancer… For sarcosine, I had an answer of a person of a website on sarcosine and schizophrenia who said The evidence for that isn’t very strong, and it’s not even clear if it increases the risk of prostate cancer (bad evidence suggests that it might increase cancer growth when already present). So I’m not sure if it’s a risk but we Don’t have good reasons to think that it is … What does it mean pratically ? For phosphatidylserine, I found no study in whi
ch is related to cancer. Furthermore, there is a Finland study which this compound found in fishes is not carcinogen. As you can see, I made a lot of research in Google scholar for a long time… What does it all these studies mean?"

176008025,"Yes, self esteem is fairly difficult. I will try to live as positively as I can."
176008026,"Why does tardive psychosis happen? Antipsychotic drugs act by blocking receptors for dopamine (a brain chemical) in your brain. But if you take an antipsychotic for a long time, your brain can respond by creating new receptors to replace the ones that the drug is blocking – and your existing receptors may also become extra sensitive. This can mean that you actually end up more likely to have psychotic symptoms as a result of taking the medication. So over time you may find you need to take a higher dose to maintain the antipsychotic effects. This risk of tardive psychosis is one reason why you’ll need to withdraw from your medication very gradually if you decide to come off it – especially if you have been taking it for a long time. Withdrawing slowly gives your brain time to readjust."

The medication made it easier to write in foreign languages, or I’d experience lucid dreams, like lucid comic book dreams. The best change there was Mucuna Pruriens, and NAC followed by _NAME_-E and L-Theanine. The _PERSON_ and NAC corrected the feeling of blurriness like I’m too disconnected to drive. _NAME_ over all improved feelings of lethargy. Also, drinking herbal tea improved lethargy. And then I had some respiratory problems which improved or bettered with Mucinex. When I got better I did some self-therapy with Dienetics Self-Analysis by _PERSON_, and a series of books by _NAME_, and _NAME_. I think this other part like mathematical thinking does seem more connected, if hypothetically scientific shortcomings fit with Disconnection Hypothesis, or if events like neuroses, or what could be like enneagram

So in response, when recently playing Lumosity and Brain H.Q., along with games like Lego Star Wars, or Professor _NAME_, could possibly demonstrate when changing medications, or supplements the change, such as with Lumosity. This clearly demonstrates a correlation between card games like solitaire, and 3d platforms, that this can in fact improve testing numbers somehow, or not. Sciences like Psychiatry, then, are stuck as a mythology, and are not entirely scientifically valid. I can catch the mistakes in the psychiatric system with luminosity. Doctors as psychiatrists are not real medical doctors, and have a mythology cult, don’t care about Lumosity."

176008075,"Hi All, I have had thought broadcasting since Summer 2016, where other people around me can hear my thoughts. The range is quite large. This is not a delusion, which I’m sure of, however I understand there is a different form of thought broadcasting which can be a delusion. I have been able to work whilst having thought broadcasting, but I have hit large bumps in my career. In November 2019 I started taking Risperidone daily - 0.5mg, then 1mg, and a few times 1.5mg. Because of that medication, I now additionally have telepathy which can be very annoying. This telepathy is with people I know, and happens throughout my day every day now. The recipients of my messages can be in a different part of the city. Does anyone have any views on whether they think this is a worsening or bettering of my mental state? I see how it could be a bettering, since the other people are able to respond telepathically, so maybe I am starting to be more normal in that I can talk to them in this way. Perhaps the next ste
p is complete control over telepathic communication. I stopped the Risperidone in January. I’m not sure what to do/take next. I’m almost tempted to take Invega (Paliperidone) at 6mg daily, but if Risperidone seemed to make my condition worse, then this might not be the best idea. I am also now taking Lion’s Mane (500mg daily) and Daily Essential Nutrients."
176008076,I have been really suspicious of my neighbor for a while now. I feel they talk bad about me to other people because I can hear it. So I think. When I confronted them they said no and that I’m such a good person they would never talk about a friend that way. They even showed me call logs. I’ve also caught these people in lies they tell about other people and brought that up. They said I was mistaken and misunderstood what was really going on. I’m having trouble discerning what is my paranoia about other people in general and what factual. Since being on meds I am seriously distrustful of other people’s motives about why they talk to me. Would someone really go far to prove a friendship to me if they were lieing? Is there any sort of reality checks I can do to find out if it’s me having a mental flaw or if there’s really something going on? And also is it common (if there is something going on) for people to be friends with you for malicious purposes because you have a illness?

174343733,"Random thought of the day: I’m still obsessed with the TV show ‘Lost’. It’s like I have a deep connection to the characters of the show. I feel like it was my destiny to be _NAME_ from ‘Lost’ but something bad happened to me that turned me into _NAME_. Maybe I tried being an engineer or investment banker and failed and ended up with schizophrenia or maybe schizophrenia was in my genes. But the aliens and my former family (Past Life) wanted me to become a doctor. I guess an orthopedic surgeon… Might have happened or might not have happened. I relate to 6-12 different charters on Lost. I’m most likely _NAME_ still but I’m definitely not going to be a doctor. I have schizophrenia and I’m 30 years old. I have depression too and drink a lot of caffeinated beverages to cope with my depression and anxiety. My father was never a doctor and neither was my step father. My father is a mechanic and my step-father was a successful engineer. Maybe _NAME_ was an engineer and not a doctor? I do
n’t know. I definitely feel like _NAME_ a lot and most of the times. I had an MRI and I started getting flashbacks and paranoia. After watching all the seasons on Lost including that of _NAME_ I started remembering that I was a time traveler that had his mind wiped, been to parallel universes, and even tried getting help from physicists. Perhaps, I wanted to be a physicist myself but was never smart enough. My consciousness does go through time repeatedly measured in the billions or more – possibly infinity. I was experimented on constantly and suffered a terrible fate where I died a lot only to come back in time and relive my life, sometimes differently. My constant was many things. It started out being a girlfriend or a lover. Then it was my mom. Then for the past billion or so lifetimes, it’s been God, and now it’s been Jesus. I’ve been abducted by aliens including grey aliens and it has affected my consciousness and soul. From what I’ve read, they have consciousness trap technology that can im
prison and control one’s soul and consciousness for eternity – practically. Like _NAME_, I’m not really religious, I’m a coward, and I tried being a doctor but probably failed. I’ve always been interested in the military but never had what it took or takes. I probably tried joining in a past life a long time ago and it failed. I was told I have alien DNA which they don’t like and I’m possibly a vampire. I don’t think I’m in the Illuminati but maybe I was in a past life. I want nothing to do with them and don’t like talking about them. Furthermore, I do enjoy conspiracy theories and crazy things and ideas. Perhaps it’s all fake and a delusion. Illuminati people are usually powerful, successful, and extremely rich – everything I am not. I’m the opposite. I think I was supposed to be a doctor or surgeon and even the aliens wanted this for me and my family. It probably never happened. I think I got the schizophrenia genes that will never go away. People have experienced hard ship and tra
uma and even constant drug use and never get psychosis or schizophrenia. But I have! Like _NAME_, I’ve never had a real religious experience and was never really religious at all. I have tried. Maybe I never had a real experience with God, but I kind of wish I had. It was probably not real but it was traumatic. I used to be an atheist and stuff but had a profound experience in college. I wouldn’t be surprised if I tried or thought about being a Monk or a religious man in a past life. But no more and no longer. I’ve never been married or had a real marriage or wife. Some people in my past lives have accused me of wanting to marry a rich girl or something since I came from a poor or middle class background, but I was misunderstood and am a lot like _NAME_ in that I would feel embarrassed about being poor and marrying into money – something I would never do in a thousand lifetimes. I am a coward. Thank you."

176008097,"Sometimes I like to color especially when my mind is racing which is normally controlled by the drugs. Lately with the holidays over and my family back to normal living I went from depressed to more restless. Also from what I overheard one of the residents is dying from cancer and I have been lost in thoughts of death and dying. The potential for war also stressed me although a significant possibility of not having a war looms on the horizon. When I color I either try conformist coloring or random coloring. Conformist coloring is when I color based on how things are supposed to look. Random is where I pick up a crayon, or coloring pencil at random and color a segment of the drawing. Random is easier and where I get the best results. However I still sometimes worry that it will look too “effeminate”. Conformist drawing makes me feel more restricted and repressed. But the anxiety is less. My poetry is the same way. Writing lyrical poetry is also more restrictive and free-style is less restrictive 
and frees my writing style. But there is a drawback. One of my brothers who performs music with his wife wanted me to write lyrical poetry for their music but I had taken free-style by then and was unable to do it. I am writing poetry again to my counselor after a long hiatus and it’s dark and full of thoughts of death and dying and psychosis. My coloring however is more positive and my random style has no limitations as I float in my mind into the sky where death and dying doesn’t bother me. Some day I will be free forever but for now my creativity is the only freedom I know."

176008104,Yeah. I dont know. I’m not coping very well but just told pdoc I was fine. The staff where I live said otherwise to him and me and said I have got worse in last 2 weeks. I only got out of hospital from a 13 week stay a month ago. I do feel scared all the time and the voices are forbidding me to speak more and more. I felt so upset because I am trying not to tell anyone anything but I had a call from a family member and had to talk now I’m getting abuse and told bad things are going to happen me along with the death stuff
174343758,It’s possible that it’s dose related but I wouldn’t wait to speak with your doctor. Just let him/her know right away.
176008105,"I recently experienced some PTSD related suppressed memory resurgences, but along with memories from my this life that I had forgotten, I received in waves and layers over some months other memories of myself living what I can only describe as a different version of events to what actually happened in this reality, like multiple parallel lives. They are that vivid that I cannot differentiate some of my past memories and parallel memories, sometimes. When I recalled my other lives I also experienced a fresh tsunami-like overload of the emotions that I experienced at the actual time of the memory, which has been painful because I recall being in different relationships in the past/parallel and now find myself still feeling in love with those men, and I miss them. It doesn’t help that as I would have a memory resurgence the voices that I hear were of those same men narrating the memory along with me for the sake of the voices that hadn’t been there at the time and were curious as to what had happe
ned. One ex boyfriend of mine whom I have multiple recollections of a life with was also exclaiming his surprise at hearing the other voices but also at having had those experiences with me, us both knowing that they came from parallel dimensions. In one of my lives with him we could telekinetically move the earth around us and figured out how to ‘time travel’ in a sense by cutting through the visibile spiritual energy grid of the earth and using the same grid lines to refocus our gazes (depth perception) and then pull places closer to us. We’ve all discussed the possibility that we could be incarnated fallen angels (hence why we had powers in the other realms’ timelines) and that this timeline was supposed to be used to hone our psychic awareness/skills, which is why we can all hear each other and converse interdimensionally. I have had hallucinations of sacred geometry and other unusual but very real things that turned out to be the Enochian alphabet and Egyptian hieroglyphics when I researched them
. I think the universe was somehow trying to show me that everything is connected and made of the same energy, and that to experience these higher dimensions we need to be vibrating at the same frequency as they are, higher to our own. I find it interesting that not only do many ancient races in their folklore and various religions allude to this, like in the concept behind ‘Om’, or beliefs like Hermetica, but science also states it too, like in quantum physics and string theory when it discusses the concept of there being multiple dimensions vibrating at different frequencies, which is why we don’t usually perceive them. Just my thoughts… Has anyone else experienced any ‘delusions’ like mine that seem to have roots in very real topics?"

Some people wish that they had a mental disorder than having muscular dystrophy. Having a physical disability sucks. Yes, there’s more _USER_ID_ attached to sz, but having MD means that your body won’t function no matter how much you tell your body to move. It’s like a nightmare. I think I accepted my disease, but at the same time I hate that I have contractures, and I hate that I will have multitude of health problems like heart diseases and pneumonia. I honestly don’t know how I can get around when I’m bound in a wheelchair after 20 years or something. Like it’s terrifying. I don’t want anyone to go through it.

176008151,"Healthline Coffee and Cholesterol: Is There a Link? Like many of the foods and beverages we consume, coffee has both good and bad aspects, and a bit of the bad is tied to your heart health. Link between coffee and cholesterol Several studies over the past decade have shown a link between coffee and cholesterol. According to one study, coffee oils (known as diterpenes) such as cafestol and kahweol are to blame. Coffee oils are naturally found in caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Research indicates that cafestol affects the body’s ability to metabolize and regulate cholesterol. According to a _NAME_-analysis of controlled studies on coffee and cholesterol, coffee oils may decrease bile acids and neutral sterols. This may lead to increased cholesterol. Researchers concluded that cafestol is the “most potent cholesterol-elevating compound identified in the human diet.” If you have a genetic mutation that slows down coffee metabolism in your body, and you drink two or more cups of coffee a day

I think it’s probably best to have as little to do with them as possible. Maybe some distance for you would be good too? Friendships are hard. I often feel used, people take a lot from me then when I need the friendship they give nothing back. I don’t know what the solution is but I just go to lots of Meetups & try to meet new people regularly so I have a range of options for socialising. On the other hand, sometimes I feel really happy with my friends and am reminded that I am capable of positive emotions (as opposed to my usual nothing/sad state) and it feels good.

I don’t know a lot of the people here now. I believe some are old-timers like me, only they changed their tags and now are under new names…but i got lost in the transition . Yes. I lived in a group home for several years and then in a supportive apartment, until i got married. I wouldn’t mind going back to one. It may be harder for me to find one due to my age and medical condition, i might get turned down. I already got turned down by an assisted living facility. I am not sure how to go about finding some group homes in the area… i have a case worker who is pretty useless…"

176008229,Yes - it is. It’s amazing what good support can do. Having said that it’s not good that if you don’t have that support(live far away from family/no family to support you) mental health services can be poor at providing the help and support you need.

174343784,"What I am aiming at is regular practice and study, routine not quantity. When you start doing things routinely, you realise how much time you waste. Applying myself on a regular basis agitates me, breaking up my day of drifting with routine. I know I simply cannot cope with applying myself full time. Even sustaining part time is hard for me. It’s not because I’m lazy, I expend masses of mental energy each day, I just can’t focus it on anything for very long. It is one of the negative symptoms of my condition. As I said, applying myself a little actually makes the lack of focus worse by causing me agitation. I start wanting to do everything under the sun. So what I want is to just do a little, diligently, and routinely, and be satisfied, and happy, with that. Thank you."
176008248,I was doing so well.
176008249,If I make it I will no longer complain or think people are after me. People thinking they are seeing a monitor of my thoughts have nearly ruined my life. A lot of death threats and cruel comments people not caring if I die. I was fine before about 2 years ago. The worse is when I get panic anxiety attacks and have people harrass me. I also suffer people in my body and people hurting me from the inside out. I hope things will get better.

176008253,"I’m on Xanax for about 8 or 9 months now and we increase it every few months, my pdoc is doing that as I’m not on sz meds because i’ve run thru them all, and the xanax helps me deal better with my homicidal/suicidal tendencies. They aren’t anywhere near gone, but it’s what we’ve got the next few years probably. So I think you should be good if not better to get back on them. Aggression sucks, and considering I’m on a short leash with hubby after threatening to shove my 16 year old’s vice principal into a freezer because he tried to say my kid did something he wasn’t even awake to do with online schooling and I know what language he would have used so it really wasn’t him…yeah, don’t do aggression.

176008255,"I have been stable for a little while now psychosis wise. This has led to the mental health people trying to resolve other underlying issues that have been hidden in the background. Now psychosis is treated, they realised I had an anxiety disorder also. Then I got diagnosed with Autism, and now I have been put on an antidepressant medication. It has been a frustrating year. The biggest thing that seemed to be affecting my mental health was my old job. Now I am free of that, I feel so much better. I think it’s a shame I had to quit the job. When I first started it, I looked up to the analysts, but by time I became one the stress was just too triggering."

176008260,I was on 30mg of diazepam for over a year. I took myself off it as I disliked being on it. It has come back around because the mental health team have not treated my anxiety so now I am back on 30mg a day for now. But not long term. I guess my answer is no benzo is good for a long term fix at all

176008263,"It can be very tempting to decrease or stop medication when we feel we’re doing better. I’ve done that a few times. Every time I’ve ended up with more medication. Our brain gets used to those chemicals and work around them to allow functional activity. Which often means when those barriers get removed, the brain is even more excited than before we had medication. So I would suggest to talk with your pdoc to either reduce extremely slowly and try to spot early signs of excitation (very hard to stay objective because we loooveee the feeling) or try to make compromise still with your pdoc between mood stabilizer and antipsychotics. Good luck!"

174343792,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov C-reactive protein is associated with severity of thought and language dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, PC _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment , 2019 Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and schizophrenia. However, the findings on psychotic severity and cognition remain inconsistent. The relationship between CRP and formal thought disorder in subdomains remains unclear.We enrolled stable patients (defined as those who had no treatment changes during the 4-week period before evaluation) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. We used the 30-item Thought and Language Disorder (TALD) scale to evaluate thought and language dysfunction over four subscales. We assessed psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). We collec
ted fasting venous blood and measured plasma CRP levels.We enrolled 60 patients with schizophrenia. All patients received TALD and PANSS evaluation, and 33 of them had their CRP levels checked. The multivariate regression analysis indicated that CRP levels were significantly associated with the total score on the TALD (t=2.757, P=0.010) and the TALD Objective Positive subscale (t=2.749, P=0.011), after sex, age, duration of illness (in years), and use of atypical antipsychotics were adjusted for. Additionally, CRP was significantly associated with the PANSS positive subscale (t=2.102, P=0.045). A significantly positive correlation was observed between the total scores on the TALD scale and PANSS (? =0.751, P<0.001).Our results suggest that abnormal CRP levels are significantly associated with formal thought and language dysfunction in the Objective Positive subdomain and positive psychotic symptoms."

176008286,"Society is made up of a scarcity of resources with only so many businesses consisting of producers, workers, and buyers. This limits the job market with employees in surplus thus lowering wages because the worker works under duress that they’re replaceable.

Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

176008294,I fully agree with you that you should break up with him. You clearly don’t have a clear understanding of the importance of respecting your partner’s needs and wants as well as your own. A true relationship is built on trust and compromise. You can’t make demands on how another person lives. It doesn’t sound like you’re paying attention to what HE needs.

Clozapine is currently the only antipsychotic medication licensed for its treatment. However, the rate of treatment resistance among outpatients with schizophrenia or other psychoses, and the rate of use of clozapine among them, is not known.The aims of this study are (a) to determine the point prevalence of treatment-resistant psychosis in a community sample, and (b) to determine the number of patients with TRS who have never had a clozapine trial.Clinico-demographic data were extracted from the case notes for 202 patients from two community mental-health teams.We found that 56% (99/176) had a diagnosis of TRS, and 52% (51/99) of these patients had never been treated with clozapine. Patients of 
non-white ethnicity were less likely to have had a clozapine trial (p=0.009). The point prevalence of treatment resistance within the bipolar affective disorder sample was 19% (5/26).These findings suggest that TRS is common in the community mental-health team, and a large proportion of these patients have not received clozapine. These findings indicate that identifying and treating treatment resistance should be a focus of community services for schizophrenia."

176008320,I have secrets that even my family don’t know about.
176008321,"I’m from the UK. I am going to appeal, but it is useless. I just rang my psychiatrist’s secretary and they said they wont write a letter to show support for it, they only do replies to what they send them."
176008322,"lol nawwww god wouldn’t do that to me. I have enough faith to believe that wouldnt happen. And besides I feel better its gone now…weird. Sorry to raise concern to this attention. But last time I had an itch this bad was last thanksgiving when I ate pie and took my pain medication after my surgery and had an allergic reaction to something. the pie or the med??? I haven’t taken/eaten either since. But last thanksgiving my eye was sooo itchy it was terrible I was up for hours and hours just in pain and eyes itching from that allergic reaction. now that I think of it, it mustve been the med, not the pie"
176008323,You seriously need help _AT_MENTION_. I trust you are under care.
176008324,Nothing. Eat. Relax…I’ve the weekend off so I’m just lazying around with a bit of exercise thrown in…It’s grand.

176008327,I just called a disability attorney. They said until I’m making $910 in one month I don’t have to report my earnings. So you were right _AT_MENTION_.
176008328,"My health goals have been kind of bad. I had a return of disordered eating when I was on Wellbutrin for a couple weeks. But now that it’s out of my system, I feel better. I bought three different kinds of fruit this week and ate them all."
176008329,"going to college, piano playing, losing weight."
176008330,"Ahhh I’m actively looking for work, I do worry about the worst case scenario though and how I would cope. I would need employers to be super understanding. Or I need to toughen up. I definitely won’t be stopping my meds, don’t dare take the risk as from what I’ve seen on this forum it usually doesn’t end well."
176008331,When I post about alcohol related things sometimes my posts get blocked. I think as other people here have issues with alcohol and me posting alcohol stuff can unsettle them as well. Admin I’m very happy you have not blocked me as this site helps me a lot. I once got blocked for a day when posting while drunk and was conformational. I’m glad people are understanding. I wouldn’t cope if I was permanently blocked.
174343810,On the letter to my GP post-diagnosis it mentioned these first rank symptoms and that I met all of them. That was in 2013 I was very sick so never really understood much until later on

176008333,I can’t answer for my corpse.
176008334,My aunt’s been married almost 40 years to a guy who adores her. She’s been obese most of her life. She was average when they got married. I think.
176008335,I will put $20 in a slot machine. But you never know. I was in Vegas several years ago and I saw a sign in the hotel casino one night that said craps lesson tomorrow at 8 am. I was into partying and chasing women then but I said if I am up I will go. That was awful early for a day off work and after a night of partying in Vegas. Long story short is I took the class and then played. Started with $40 and quickly had over $1400. I made a mistake. You can bet on hard numbers in the middle and I wanted my winnings but the guy thought I said leave it in the middle. I didn’t say anything and hard 8s hit again so I won a lot on that one roll. The pit boss started watching me. I quit while I was ahead. I don’t remember anything much about how to play craps but I have never played again. I figure it’s time for me to lose. So if you ever see a sign for a class just go. You might get lucky like I did. I was in Vegas for work with a whole bunch of other Marines and they all lost money and gave me a semi ha
rd time on the way home. It made up for all the money I spent at a strip Club a couple nights before.
176008336,"So my brother admitted to me the other night two hours after having done so that he thinks he might have poisoned our dogs by letting them lick his hands after he worked on his car, with antifreeze. I spend the night till 7A.M. up with my dog, and his dog is basically my dog at this point just because I’m around it for so long… Anywho I get little sleep and we figure that they’re probably ok because they’re not showing symptoms but I stay up anyway because ???? it. If this is my last day with my dog I’m gonna be with her. Anywho he’s obviously upset, but won’t take responsibility for just how stupid what he did was. So today he’s acting like nothing happened. Goes to hitch up his trailer and asks for help, and then calls me stupid because I move it the wrong way. Well at this point I’m tired, and had enough of his ????. So I say, “no, you know what’s stupid, is almost poisoning our ??????? dogs.” Of course he flies off the handle and seems about ready to attack me physically 
which pumps my adrenaline. I tell him “If you even touch me I’m calling the cops.” So now that’s done, and I’m just sitting here. Feeling the very obvious sensations in my brain at all this excitement and activity and its just ???????? that I can’t even be ALLOWED to be mad at my brother for nearly killing both our dogs in one of the most stupid ways I can imagine. My brain won’t let me, and stay cognisant. I’m ??????? reliant on my family if I don’t want to be placed in a home, and I can’t even have a dog without the ??????? moron nearly killing it because he’s too stupid to ??????? wash his hands. God I wish I was strong enough to pound him into the pavement but that’s another thing. I don’t have the willpower to work out. ??????? powerless in my own life it feels like."

176008351,"Bankers who give credit and charge interest are practicing usury. Is it permitted; it is a crime, it will all come back to them in the end, karmically and by the law of cause and effect. The golden mean, a spiral of growth, is a fact of life, but so is pi, the ratio between the radius and circumference of the circle. Someone opinioned to me that if they introduced universal basic income, the prices would rise. This is not real economics, tax, usury is always in affect. It is at once a spiral and a circle, an unbounded life. Order demands that we discriminate, at a given time and space. Both credit and income are valid, depending on the circumstances. I do not expect to earn exactly the same as everyone else, nor do I expect to be exploited in exactly the same way, but government has a duty to ensure that life continues to take place in the appropriate way. Who are they to judge our contributions; are they superior just because we elect them and they control the purse strings; we elect people to ser
ve, both us and others. Some people inherit wealth, continuity demands a beginning at the very least. Bankers job is to invest. The hardest work is to suffer, but not all those who suffer know how to work well. Investing in education, health and recovery is a must. Investing in talent, time and skills is also vital. Credit is given when requested. Bankers need to learn to invest in life. Thank you."

176008355,I understand that it is hard to relate to what I go through. They say it is all in my mind but not all of it is in my mind. I don’t want things to become worse. Everyday is the same problem. Just want a normal life and no more intrusive thoughts.
176008356,What’s DBT?

My thoughts are very disorganized like usual. My thoughts arent making much sense. Maybe I’m disassociating too maybe. I feel like I have dementia… do I go to hospital and ask for an increase?
176008368,PubMed Why do patients with psychosis listen to and believe derogatory and... The study generated a wide range of reasons why patients listen to and believe DTVs. Awareness of these reasons can help clinicians understand the patient experience and also identify targets in psychological intervention.

I wish your parents can give you and your children some tangible support while hopefully your husband will struggle through this rough time. I am not religious so I’m not sure if your church -going will give you the strength and spirit you need. When I was in rough time usually the ancient sages’ book (Taoism) gives me wisdom, strength and hope to withstand the hardship. Send to you my good vibes."
176008381,I love the nighttime too dude

176008383,"We don’t know everything about reality, and we don’t know everything about the power of the mind.

Situations in my life drive me litterally crazy, mentally I’ve been pushed almost to the brink of insanity. But here’s the bizarre part. I honestly feel that nothing terrible has happened to me! Weird I know. But hell, no real crisis’s have happened. There’s no huge life events or big catastrophes. Despite how it sounds sometimes, I am stable a large part of the day. Even the periodic craziness of life has a silver lining: it’s damn interesting! I could do without it, I don’t want it. I hate it. But I can appreciate the weirdness of life. Hell, I have a nice, clean apartment, I have all four limbs, I have a little money, my sisters insist I’m good looking.

176008402,Yeah. I think most people would take a nap during the day if they had the chance. Now if you are sleeping hours during the day that is different and may signify you are over sedated with your meds or maybe need to take them at night instead of morning or could be a sleep disorder type thing.

Tags and registration fees on my car are due this month. For next month: Get my next lease sorted out And that’s about it regarding real life things… Added chores on top of maintaining house and making it to work. Still trying to gain more self-control over things. Alcohol, coffee, nicotine. Just did 50+ hours without any of them though I ate a lot of food in that duration. Down to 4, yeah that’s right 4, caffeine drinks a week. Pretty proud of that. Drinking alcohol is still pretty unpredictable… and consistent… and expensive. Even just twice a week and I’ll wind up spending more than I like. Nicotine is the real chore of it. Easy to get away from… difficult to make sure it stays that way. At the end of the last 2 days of no vices… I was stuck just looking at how I’m still stuck in waiting for the next phase of my life. It
’ll be 3 full years that I’ve been living with other people. I have fallen so far and removed from the sense of self-empowerment and clarity I used to know. I can get close to replicating it… but it’s not as genuine as when it was just me versus the world. Lessons have been learned though. Still trying to make the most of it instead of throw in the towel and just do whatever I want in order to pass time. It’s like living in an incubator, awaiting rebirth. Next year will be engineered from the ground up to allow myself to really get ahead. Financially… that is. I found the town I want to live in. Got a friend moving out there later this year. The transition will be expensive. I hope to have as much of the years expenses under my belt before even moving. If I gotta throw in the towel and move back… it’d better be without any standing lease to pay for. I’m hoping that I’ll have gotten myself sustainable out there after just a few months. More people, more progressive activity, more restaurant
s and social events. More job oppurtunities. More preferential weather conditions and a more scenic view. Colorado Springs here I come! Or at least I hope. Maybe I’ll even find some strong romance out there. Kansas has just a bit of everything… but that is to be interpreted literally… spread thin on a coarse piece of traditional toast. So that’s me… all that is relevant to say at this point in time. Take care amigos. Will be glad to hear from you."

My dad came out with no scratches thankfully, but I sensed it, saw it and told her before it happened. I read somewhere that our nervous systems are intertwined with those we’re closest to making it easy to sense how we feel together and away from each other. I believe they studied twins, but that it can happen with any close kin, that share a roof, time, meals together. It would explain why our death rate goes up when our spouses die.

176008439,"I was in homeschool from ages 14+. The decision was two fold, my symptoms were starting to emerge, which my family thought I was psychic; and my grandmother had breast cancer, my mom sold our place, and we moved in with them, I cooked and cleaned and helped take care of my grandmother. Missed a lot of social aspects of school, I had no friends, never went to games or dances. Just me alone at home watching after my grandmother."

176008444,Do you have a hobby?
176008445,"I think there is support for mortgages. There is a special benefit, I am not sure if it will cover the whole mortgage though. Maybe look at alternatives like selling the house and maybe apply for shared ownership or start renting again. Just keep making plans until you find something that works, that is what I do."
176008446,Sorry to hear that. have you tried cutting out gluten and dairy too?
176008447,I have no idea who you even are.

174343842,"Welcome to the forum. My doctor is always up for trying me on another med. If it’s not working for you let them know and see if they will let you try something else. I didn’t like Invega either. I’m on Aripiprazole(Abilify) now. If you’re an adult and not court ordered to be on Invega then I see no reason why you can’t DEMAND to be put on a different drug or threaten to quit them completely. Seriously, I would suspect doctors and family would be more open to you trying a new drug rather than quitting altogether."

176008458,"I think the fact that you are asking us if you’re addicted to valium shows that you probably are. You’re taking more than prescribed and like the way it feels, Both not good. You should call your doctor and tell them, See what the next step is."
176008459,I have learned that anger is a choice of action not and emotion. Your emotion that makes you choose to be angry is Sadness or Fear. So what I do to calm myself down when I choose to get angry is I try to pin point what I am angry or afraid of. This way I have a better understanding of where I’m coming from and have more control on my actions and emotions.
176008460,Yes L dopa is dangerous but useful for parkinson patients as they have a known deficiency of dopamine. For general people it raises motivation a bit but soon causes dependency issues. For mental issues people never try it as it can cause psychosis. L tyrosine is the safest one to try but that too can create psychosis in some. Anger is the starting symptom which can turn to psychosis if not controlled.
176008461,I didn’t realize there was a difference. My bad.
176008462,"For heartburn I recommend pepcid or generic name famotidine twice a day. I simply couldn’t live without it as I have acid reflux to the point of choking on it when I lay down and the famotidine completely takes care of it 99% of the time. Fatty foods, spicy foods and sugar trigger heartburn and high fiber low fat diets are good for controlling it. If you are having pain in your liver area and heartburn you could have something wrong with you gallbladder. I suffered for a long time with pain from gallstones when I was in my 20’s until finally a stone got stuck and I had to have emergency surgery to have my gallbladder removed. It took care of the liver pain but I still have the heartburn all these years later. Look up gallbladder disease and see if it matches your symptoms, you might want to get screened for it, I think they do an ultrasound for that. Anyway I hope you feel better."

174343840,"According to the dsm 5, psychopathy cannot be given as a dx if schizophrenia is already a dx for the person. Is that because schizophrenics have a common delusion that they are psychopaths? Or maybe because schizophrenics display psychopathic behaviour? Idk. I feel like a psychopath because i basically wrote my family off yesterday. Did they deserve it? Was it mainly due to delusional thought? Or am i just a psychopath and they all know it? Idk. Thoughts?"
176008478,Yeah I felt extremely vunerable on it. It’s not perfect now but I just dont feel as bad. Negatives not as bad but it may have to do with the omega 3s I’m taking.

174343843,"I’ll be honest with you… the only reason I am in University, the only reason I was able to go back to University and actually study was because my mom moved house to a very quiet neighborhood and almost overnight, I stopped hearing half the voices I use to hear… which led me to the conclusion I was only hearing those voices cause my mind was somehow converting noice from out people talking into schizophrenic noise in my mind/ this why when I stopped hearing people chattering outside, I stopped hearing most voices. In fact, a psychologist I read about who was studying schizophrenia came to the conclusion the only people who get cured from schizophrenia are people who leave who leave there regular lives and go home to live with there parents ( and I believe what that psychologist didn’t acknowledge was the patient he studied who got cured, lived in a quiet neighborhood - and it was only because he went to his quiet home in the early stages of his schizophrenia that he as able to get cured).

It took years but eventually I stopped needing to be reassured and now when something comes up like numb fingers or chest pain I attribute it rightly to anxiety and tell myself if it’s something more and it’s my time to die, then so be it.

From Google: People with thought blocking often interrupt themselves abruptly mid-sentence. They might pause for several seconds or minutes. When they start talking again, they often change the topic of conversation. Thought blocking is common in people with schizophrenia."

I could sit and be still in my mind while meditating. It is a fairly subtle effect and calming. It reminds me of NAC in a way. Perhaps, i can swap my couple of cans of beer in the evening for this.

176008582,"Here’s how it went down for me _AT_MENTION_. When I was 17, I was compelled to enroll in therapy per the local psych hospital. I had left a trail of destruction behind me since I was 12. The hospital had serious concerns about me being in society and wreaking havoc. I can’t get into things I did or I’d be run off of here, but it was placed upon the therapist to try to make me suitable for society. Her approach was kind of bleak, but the goals were accomplished. We worked long and hard on my behavior, and in the end she basically got me to the point where I could function without being imprisoned or otherwise be a burden upon society. I can’t get into details, like I said, but I did a lot of things that would cause a negative cloud to hover over me."
176008583,"Well I’ll be the envy of most women. During that time of the month I do not experience any pain, cramping or other physical symptoms. It doesn’t even affect my mood. Literally the only thing I have to complain about is the inconvenience of it."

But I’m under review myself right now and a little worried that since I’ve worked so long that I may not be seen as disabled under their rules. I remember like 6 or 7 years ago I talked to a Social Security worker over the phone and she basically told me if I can work and keep under the monthly dollar limit allowed I could get SSDI forever. I filled out forms a month ago and they sent me a letter saying that I still qualify as disabled and my benefits and eligibility won’t change. But just two weeks ago they sent me some more forms asking more details about my disability. And they have a form for my doctor to fill out. I’m worried as hell."

Its a social organization that helps people with low income by giving them food, clothes and offers support. My colegues dont know i have schizophrenia, i didnt said anything related to any illnes so far to them. Only few of them knows im sz who accepted me and put me to sign a voluntary contract for 1 year. At the beggining of this year i’ve been in a day center for people with disabilities, it didndt work for me. They have been invited at the place i go to receive the help they need. I wonder if all colegues know about me? The situation is inevitable it seems, i’ve been invited and stupid me i accepted. My question is what should i do? What if people finds out im paranoid schizophrenic? I worry about the _USER_ID_ and of the fact that i could be “rejected” by people there finding out i have a mental illness. I think too much about this these few last days. Help?"

176008602,"I don’t recommend ‘coping’. Coping means that you’ll essentially only let the underlying problem linger while you use outside sources to push it aside. Think about that: pushing it aside doesn’t resolve it; it will get your attention one way or another. Otherwise, it will create tension and upset with your current relationships. Not even just your romantic relationships. I mean all of them."

176008604,"I was in a psych ward wearing a diaper, how the hell else do you describe that? I’ve spent most of my recovery with people telling me not to push the boundaries. Yeah, right. The whole point of a brick wall is a sledgehammer. Stand aside if you don’t want to get hurt."

But I worked hard and penny-pinched along the way, I was able to save enough for a 10% down payment on a condo. So it can be done!"

174343875,"Hi everybody! I’m _NAME_ from mid-easter Europe. When I was 18 yo I was diagnosed first with paranoid syndrome in the hospital. Since this time, I have been taking aripripazole 15mg. Three years of remission and then I withdrew my meds by myself. Eventually, I became manic for two month. My doctor said I probably have schizoaffective disorder. But now I feel quite well, sometimes I’m a little depressed but I found a job (a lovely job with disabled teenager) and I have a lot of friends (some of they I met on polish forum on fb about shizophrenia, they are great people! _AT_MENTION_ <3 ) My boyfriend and family support me and I think it’s very important. I love art, good music, travels and spending my time outside (running, rollerskating or mountain climbing). I hope I’ll meet here a lot amazing people, I’ll improve my english and learn new stuff.

I can’t spend more than 5 mins in a cafe or restaurant by myself. I have to be with someone. It’s been so hot here that it’s hard to run in this weather. Night time changes my whole perspective even more. Then people get crazy! When I was on vacation I thought the guy we rented from was going to kill us all. That he kills you after he forces you to write something nice in the guest book. I told my bf and he said you seriously need new meds"

176008626,That was nice of you.
176008627,"So the state department of mental health finally assigned me a case worker and I absolutely love her. She said I was definitely her easiest client, and her only one that continuously took their meds. I feel like I can finally rest now that I have a professional looking out for me. She also has said multiple times that she does not call the cops, which makes me feel SO much better. The cops in my town have a history of mistreating people with psychiatric disabilities poorly including beating a man with dementia to death because he wouldn’t respond to their questions. She also said later on in my degree if I want an internship she could probably get me work at her sister’s tech firm which is great. Now it’s time for me to start spreading my wings a bit now that I have someone looking out for me."
176008628,"But I think you’re right, _AT_MENTION_, everything always works out. If I spend too much time worrying about the future, I’ll miss out on the present. Things are pretty good right now."
176008629,We’ve all had bad thoughts _AT_MENTION_ just because someone thinks something bad doesnt mean they are bad. People arent perfect. And sometimes really ?????? up things go through our heads. I’ve had similar bad thoughts in the past and eventually they subsided. Mainly those thoughts stemmed from my anger and hurt. Now I like to think I’m not a bad person now. And I like to believe I wasnt a bad person then either. I was just angry and scared and confused. It’s not easy to live with thoughts like that. Especially when you do NOT want to act on them. But in conclusion thoughts dont make you bad. Actions do.

174343885,Sounds like valid thinking to me _AT_MENTION_ . My excessive risk taking period (which I think was caused by Abilify) basically wiped me out financially and I went from having an investment portfolio worth $750000 plus other assets to bankruptcy in 6 years. I’ve been clawing my way back from bankruptcy and I’m now paying off all my debts but it sure has been a struggle. I believe Abilify changed my life for the worse. I wish I wasn’t on an Abilify right now at all but that is what my psychiatrist has me on. I’ve asked him to change me from the 50/50 risperidone/Abilify mix he has me on to something else but this last time I asked a few weeks ago he refused. I’m dependent on him to renew my prescriptions so I have to do what he says. My only other option is to stop taking my meds which I don’t want to do or get another psychiatrist which is very difficult to do around here. Basically I like and trust him but on this issue we have a difference of opinion.

176008681,Nice! You’re so talented _AT_MENTION_.
176008682,"I have the urge sometimes but if I even forget to take my meds for like a couple hours I start to get withdrawal, so I don’t think I could go off even if I really wanted to."
176008683,I’ve been on Depakote for my bipolar for years. At doses above 1000mg it can zonk you out. Also it can make you gain weight especially over the 1000mg mark. It’s a potent med for mood stabilization especially effective for mania and mixed states. It also helps my depression.
176008684,I’m absolutely physically dependent on Abilify and Klonopin.
176008685,I don’t get it I use to have normal erections but it was smaller by an inch when I was using olanzopine How did it do that when it only increase prolactin by a bit I hope to god it’s not a bother problem that’s not reversible… now I’m on loxapine and I lost width size and testicle size and have weak erections which I know it’s from prolactin I realized tho my sexual desire was not strong on Olanzapine tho
176008686,Me too _AT_MENTION_.
176008687,What are some ways they could show you they care? I know it’s pretty rocky regarding mental illness and your relationship with your mother.
176008688,"Im worried that i might turn into a vegetable brain, does schizophrenia get worse over time, i feel dumber than last year."
176008689,Remembering this reinforces a belief that I may have been (am still am) psychotic. I recognize that this belief was false. So maybe the belief that I will be kidnapped to North Korea is also false.
176008690,"Oh geez, I’m so sorry. Maybe some self-help books then? DBT has been most helpful for me. There are workbooks."
176008691,"Welcome. If you find yourself in need of help, just tag a moderator. Type the @ symbol, then our names _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_, and _AT_MENTION_ Enjoy your stay with us!"
176008692,i like your posts _AT_MENTION_ you have a great character
176008693,Jeeeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzz meree.
176008694,"Yeah. During my first break I was experiencing gaslighting. I had delusions of grandeur. Then when I realised and removed myself from the environment, the other effects of ptsd started to arise. Slowly I got worse, the grandeur was gone but real psychosis started to develop. It leaves a strong scar."
176008695,"Yes, it’s good for twitches _AT_MENTION_"
176008696,What does it feel like?
176008697,"You could always text him. I find it hard to keep conversation going with relatives on the phone, but its easy to say short messages and birthday wishes etc."
176008698,Its hard to function when reality looks fake.
176008699,Because it was harming me after 13+ years on APs
176008700,"Great news! The trans gym I go to is offering online classes during quarantine for free, with a suggestion of paying what you can so they can continue to pay their staff."
176008701,I don’t know if this relates to what’s happening to you. I have a court case on a guardianship matter and there is a test for capacity so they don’t become my guardians but I keep thinking it has to do with them sending me to North Korea and deciding capacity to be a dictator. It’s like it’s related but not quite as everyone keeps telling me here. But I get paranoid anyway even though one doesn’t have much to do with the other. I just think it does. And then there’s my boyfriend who makes me paranoid. I think he’s the devil but that isn’t likely true either. But I keep thinking it is.
176008702,Not gonna happen.
176008703,My life has no meaning. I just sit around online all day and do nothing.
176008704,"Have you seen this stuff? It’s amazing. They pull out all kinds of stuff. The guy just pulled out a table and chairs _AT_MENTION_. I’ve seen them pull out metal credenzas and lockers and shelves. They pull out safes all the time and bikes. Tools, hardware. I don’t know why but I love this stuff."
176008705,I like tons of people on here…4am can’t sleep I can always come here and there’s alot of good humor to go along with the serious topics. People start threads on stuff I never think about so it’s refreshing.
176008706,"_AT_MENTION_ I think I can do very well in Korea in terms of relationships with people and I think you can do so as well. You wrote that many older people play Janggi. And the younger dislike it and ostracize players. But I think you didn’t really try it. I bet you are not a registered player at the Korean Janggi association and never tried to participate in competitions. In my estimate if you learn the rules of Janggi and improve as a player it will help you find friends and it will command the respect of your peers, both young and old, in Korea."
176008707,Good luck. Our house is finally peaceful we had a horrible roommate and it took months to get her out. A bad roommate wrecks the whole vibe.
176008708,Well at least you’re not shallow
174343892,I tried quite a few and got lucky with abilify. I didn’t have any luck with the others. I tried quite a few. I was able to tolerate for example seroquel but it did nothing for me.
176008709,I’ll go sleep soon hope it helps
176008710,hugs. I got reviewed beginning of this year and got reapproved for seven years. I was hospitalized in january though
176008711,Wow. Good for you. Hopefully I can get to that point where I don’t care.
176008712,I dont probably have sz but i have no brain damage
176008713,Long story sorry i Will tell doctor Excuse me
176008714,Sadly it is very common.
176008715,This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
176008716,Catatonia raped me when I was unmedicated. Its the worst feeling someone can feel. Felt like death.
176008717,Don’t cross the hoses!
176008718,I managed without meds for five years with only a few residual symptoms but then I got a major relapse and had to return to them. That was nearly eight years ago. Been on them ever since and each time I try to come off I relapse more. If you are hearing voices how come your pdoc wants to reduce your dose???
176008719,"That is a nice post _AT_MENTION_ . I hope you find someone nice, or otherwise just the excitement of a flirt. The rush of flirting is nice. I think i have a crush-on-first-sight on a colleague from another organisation im working with. He is cute. I hope one day i get over my fear of men and have sex again too. That would be nice."
176008720,"If you call them from a smart phone , it’ll have a log of the call that you can see. Or any cellphone in fact."
176008721,I was on Vraylar for a short period of time and I found it to be extremely stimulating. It wasn’t working for me maybe because I could only tolerate the lowest dose. I became psychotic on Vraylar and had to be committed to a psych hospital. Wasn’t a good med for me but could end up being your miracle drug. Good luck!
176008722,I don’t for a second believe any psychiatrist would prescribe 5 anti psychotics at those doses. You must be bull shitting.
176008723,_PERSON_ chrisjjack123 I think
176008724,"Most people on tumblr aren’t attention seekers just for the sake of being attention seekers. Many of the “attention whore” pages that I’ve seen on the site are really just people who are going through it attempting to reach out in hopes of finding others to share their burdens with. That’s just what people do. That said, if you’re truly interested in staying well, then tumblr’s mental health scene really isn’t a good place to be. I’m not convinced that they’re all (or even mostly) attention seekers, but even I have to admit that most of the pages aren’t exactly recovery oriented. It’s not a community of people who want to help each other get well. It’s overwhelmingly a group of people who just want other people to be ill with."
176008725,If you don’t mind can you explain how they’ve made your life better reading somebody comments on this site is scaring me a bit not gonna lie
176008726,I also grew up in a very abusive home. It definitely left its scars on us. I’m sure that affects our recovery a lot
176008727,So you’ve never been so annoyed that you want to kill? Sorry I don’t believe you. No I’m not a murderer
176008728,"And you’ll be fine, life will go on. Just cooperate with your pdoc and take your meds. I’m not trying to scare you or anything by saying you have sz, and it’s just my uneducated opinion anyways. Only your doctors can diagnose you"
176008729,they torture ppl and all ppl know that with no mercy with all tools in their hand why dont you think they killed him ?? i am afraid of whats more than this

176008731,"This is kind of a gray area, but do you have a God belief? It might change the nature of your voices. Make them less evil. But that doesn’t fix everything, you need good treatment. What have you tried?"
176008732,"Nope. Subaru. Those bad boys go anywhere. My Subaru was only $10,000."
176008733,Like _PERSON_’s? Lol
176008734,Very nice _AT_MENTION_!
176008735,"Yes. Get in touch with your inner voice. I do that too. I too am struggling to work. Last thursday I was struggling with intrusive thoughts while at work, came home and had a minor relapse and was sick until today. I will try to manage it better next time, but it’s not easy because I never know how my mind will act from day to day. We just gotta keep trying and hopefully find a way to cope although we can’t expect our lives to run very smooth at least we can come to peace with how thing are hopefully and make the best of it. Not giving up. Just have to remind myself that there is family, friends, work environment, society and not least, myself that I need to try and stand up for. One day at a time…"
176008736,"Hi, here’s a new track “Where’s Your Love” by me and my neighbour. I’m pretty sure this is my last song for the year. Enjoy!"
176008737,"Yeah, _AT_MENTION_ - he got Kaatherine85 and I beat my a mile!"
176008738,Don’t you remember what was told to you on the last thread you started this on? You were told if you started another thread on this again you would be closed down!
176008739,Oh you schizo alright
176008740,I have hard lump on my leg which is just fat.
176008741,"The good thing for me was I havn’t noticed side effects on invega sustania. Not sure if it helps me much or not though with the thought disorders. I prefer only having to take it once a month too, or inject it i mean."
176008742,"they drudged my so much that i culdent find eny mind of my own. they make my such a trauma from meds, that i cant bring my self to take them again, and i need them so much"
176008743,_AT_MENTION_ - I started drinking it twice a day and started getting heartburn in the middle of the night so I was only drinking it once a day. I eventually stopped drinking it completely and my energy levels have been stable since then. I still drink it here and there with a straw but not as much.
176008744,i know it couldve been worse but this was already bad enough for my little brain
176008745,My initial delusions of this all encompassing universal personality protecting me was very very comforting yep.
174343905,Like I said direct L-carnosine didn’t work out for me but beta Alanine did. Best of luck with it.
176008746,My SZTPD was caused by a bad mushroom trip and weed. Psychedelic drugs can cause SZ and send you to hell. I was there and finally came out again.
176008747,_AT_MENTION_ I believe the past and the future is rearranged in real time. What do you think?
176008748,"Oh sweet pea, it’ll be ok. You’ll get your pretty smile back. Mine goes away after while."
176008749,i hv general idea it can be anxiety and it is symptoms but can it be git symptoms like pain in my abdomen i have can it be nausea i hv from time to time can it be i feel that i hv weak nerves sometime anyone can enlighten us about this topic ?_USER_ID_?? thank you very much
176008750,Is it the tattoo? Take care _AT_MENTION_
176008751,"_AT_MENTION_ It doesn’t sound like you’re doing anything wrong. You’re already at a low weight though, so it’s going to be harder to lose more. That’s why my long-term goal weight is 180. I probably can get to 150, but it would be so much work. I don’t think I have the patience for being that low. I am a large boned person though, not sure about you. 180 on me looks very good. I’ll be happy with that. It may very well be just the meds in your case. I think I am having success with losing on Zyprexa because I’m at such a high starting weight. Limiting to 1200-1400 calories is as low as I would go, and that’s what I have been doing since I started on the new med. Once I get down to a certain point, I’m sure it will be harder for me to lose too. I fully anticipate that. I probably won’t keep losing two pounds per week even though I stay on the lower calories. But starting from 268 like I did when I first started Zyprexa, I have a lot of room to move lower before it gets overly di
fficult! I envy you being 158.2!"
176008752,Previously it would take me hours to feel normal after waking up. Like up to 6 hours sometimes. Id always feel “hungover”. Now I feel ok after about an hour. I think I’ve finally stumbled on a supplement combination that works well for me. I take this just after waking up : Beta Alanine 750mg L-theanine 200mg 2 cups of coffee I think all my faffing around with supplements has finally paid off.
176008753,Also learned how to drive a forklift when I worked unloading trucks at Sears.
176008754,Yesterday my pdoc called me out of the blue because I tried setting up an appointment two days previously. Had no idea he was gonna call at that point and almost didn’t answer. We only talked 7-8 mins but man it was short but succinct I got two meds refilled and I really felt I got everything I had to say in those 7-8 minutes out. My mind is working really clear and I don’t forget my points too much. I feel Very clear
176008755,You got this Ninja. You just recently passed calculus so try not to torture yourself.
176008756,Sorry for your loss _AT_MENTION_
176008757,"I’m grateful for, My internet friends, My husband and family, My health. I’ll tag _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_"
176008758,"hey guys, little update, the little guy has some health problems so i am giving him back to the previous owner, i take him to the vet tomorrow and then he is going back to be with his original owner, he has an infection so i said i’d pay for everything bc i like the wee guy, have loved having him around. his owner has split up with her bf (my acquaintance) so she can care for him better now as he had a big dog. hopefully the meds i get for his infection will keep him well for a long time."
174343901,Thats what I am worried about had that feeling on fluonxol.
176008759,Like without that you might just get reincarnated.
174343904,"Negative symptoms can appear from many reasons. One is which we cannot control like mental diseases and other is we make due to our actions and behaviour. for example the substances we take. For example cocaine and other harmful things can create negative symptoms in future. Same way APs can cause these especially if the dosage is high and for long duration. And due to our behaviour like bad habits like excessive sleep or lack of sleep, excessive eating, bad addictions like alcohol, nicotine, masturbation etc, lack of regular exercise, lack of short term and long term goals in life and many others. This way its not about the disease itself and there is always room for improvement but it all starts with the individual’s efforts to improve their situation."
174343911,Yea coke cola helps me _AT_MENTION_
176008760,Are you saying not giving into my family game about the camera and moving on with my life?
176008761,No _USER_ID_ this one’s supposed to be for daytime sleepiness. But I just checked and found out that it’s rx and costs 12k. If i could get it under my insurance I would try it.
174343909,"_AT_MENTION_ yes I’m on Abilify but it doesn’t work for the only delusion I have And _AT_MENTION_ I went to school today, it was nice. I was supposed to take an English test but didn’t yet. I’m okay"
174343910,Abilify had the opposite effect for me. I have to take metformin now.
174343906,"This is a forum for people who have experienced psychosis, not just schizophrenia . In any case diagnoses can change and change back again depending on the pdoc you happen to see."
176008762,No need to feel bad for me _AT_MENTION_ . My voices don’t bother me at all.
176008763,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ . How is your day going so far?
174343918,I am actually _PERSON_
174343915,I guess even meds will never stop my “delusion” of going to heaven by killing myself. No one can prove what’s after death. Its all theories only.
176008764,"I have pictures all over this forum. What, You only see your own?"
176008765,Yes I hope we both can. _PERSON_ well do it. Going at it slow with weight loss is better than too fast.
176008766,I’m getting to where there isn’t much I enjoy and it’s really hard to exercise and stay awake and do things. I feel like I’m a downer.
174343913,"Oh God. Don’t tell me you’re part of it too. Is that an insult? I was being a grade a bi tch while I was having a rough time with stress and irritability, but I’ve apologized for it multiple times now and will not do so again. Additionally, while someone living in a delusion that I’m not living in is technically a difference in opinion, I refuse to support people’s delusional ideas in order to avoid an argument. Finally, if someone posts something on the forum as if it is a fact but they’re wrong, I’m not going to just sit and let them be wrong in order to avoid hurting the poster’s feelings while people come along and make decisions or whatever based on that wrong information."
176008767,how r u doing now
176008768,I’m so lucky that i communicate with him. He had will power and iron fist.
176008769,Soda has lots of chemicals. Diet even more. I think drinking a six pack in one day is doing it outside of moderation. But root beer is good!
176008770,This is pretty much all I have done since being diagnosed 13 years ago. I’d like to do something more but I struggle even with keeping appointments and the idea of doing something where Im interacting with people who don’t know me on a regular basis frightens me.
176008771,"My son always made fun of me for having sza. That is until he got it. Then, he changed his tune."
176008772,yes no i make a little money on the side but it really isn’t a job 0 voters
176008773,If someone is wrong about something it isn’t necessarily a delusion unless the person believes they are right no matter what. I have been escaping from the presence so my intuition has been weak for a long time. Getting better lately though since I’m working things out.
174343917,What dosage of Clozapine are you on?
176008774,So what’s your boyfriend’s explanation for your delusions?
174343926,"Meds are not sleeping pills unless you don’t have positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions at all. Meds stop my voices, especially the bad ones that tell me to kill myself and kill people."
176008775,This won’t last forever Tomorrow is another day Sleep helps You aren’t alone You may have hallucinations for the rest of your life That’s ok You can handle it
176008776,I’m on 116mg Invega and have retrograde erections or reduced semen production. Orgasms are not so great as they used to do. Don’t do marathons anymore. When I was only 2mg risperidone I ejaculated more and had morning erections. Do you experience any this? Which medication and dose are you on?
176008777,I hope you’re ok _AT_MENTION_. We’ll miss you. Good luck with everyone
174343925,When I was on Invega I had vivid crazy dream’s. I was given clozapine to augment the Invega now I sleep fine.

176008789,"Are you stable on your meds now since quitting your job? I assume your program starts this September. It might not be a good idea to start studying so soon after having a relapse. But if you think you are stable then by all means go for it. Sure you will be in debt but you can gradually pay it back, provided nursing is something you truly enjoy. I am planning to go to law school and quitting my current job which provides good income…so basically I would miss out on earning 70k each year for 3 years then I would also rack up 100k in debt. However, I think it’s worth it cause law is something I am truly passionate about."
176008790,"hi _AT_MENTION_ . thanx for ur reply. in few words u have given an apt, sensible and realistic happy reply. I liked it. I think in some peoples lives like us there is pain. there’s no point in asking why me, bcoz we may ask that for our entire life and get no answer. I would like to befriend u. r u an Asian? bcoz I am one, I am an indian. of course geography doesn’t matter. I hope ur degenerative disease and sz both go away by god’s grace and blessing.

176008791,"The catch is “reasonable accommodations”. Is there a case worker or social worker that you can talk to about what this means for you? If so, make a list and send it in to your work with a letter from your social/case worker (or even pdoc) letting the office know of your needs. That way ,you have something documented that you gave them, and they can better work with you. You can’t do much to handle a panic attack other than breathe through it, so for things like that, I think a brief break would be reasonable. Falling asleep, not so much, but you already know that."

176008796,"for as long as i can remember i have never been ok mentally i feel like i will never be able to be stable or have friends or a life because i have so many problems. i quit my first job after only one day and have episodes almost every few days where i am crying or angry with myself and suicidal, i cant go outside (unrelated to covid) because i get anxious and think im going to be robbed or killed, even when i dont think that i feel like im being judged and made fun of or disliked by everyone, sometimes i dont want to leave the house also because i think when i come back all my stuff will be taken. and now when i think about it i dont think this will improve, im not hearing voices anymore as ive been on meds for years and most of my psychosis symptoms are reduced (except when i hear people talking from a distance like through a wall i start thinking they are talking about me and listening to me and i get intrusive thoughts of the kinds of things that it sounds like they are saying, kind of like the 
experience of having auditory hallucinations 24/7 has been etched into my brain so even now that its better now i can still remember accurately what its like and that feeds the intrusive thoughts.) but i dont know what i can really do to not feel all depressed and suicidal and unstable or able to commit to doing anything. i dont remember feeling like this when i was on olanzapine but i also gained 180 lbs on that med and got TD, my mom tells me that she thinks i was doing my best after i switched to the med im on now (invega), but i think its just because i had more energy and was finally able to stick to a diet and lose weight. after a few months tho my appetite went high again and i havent lost anymore weight. that was before i became dependent on klonopin and withdrawn cold turkey. maybe meds arent strong enough to keep me stable since ive started experiencing benzo withdrawal but i wonder if maybe its no longer benzo withdrawal and maybe just the med im on isnt treating everything. the things that makes m
e think its still benzo withdrawal tho is that my psychosis is under control, so thats what makes me think the meds are working, its hard to tell tho because i started klonopin 3 months after starting invega and i didnt start feeling much worse until after i stopped klonopin completely. idk ive been trying to figure out whats the cause of whats wrong with me for a while but im not sure"

We get posts like that occasionally, but the folks here are pretty quick to redirect pity parties and offer hope. I am very proud of our community. Usually, we get a post once a month or so from someone in a very dark place. They are quickly offered support and resources, and any really dangerous posts are flagged and removed usually within an hour. We are the statistical outlier in support forums, not them."

176008803,"Medications in development, phase 2/3 Spring 2021 This list does not include medications that do not have current trials underway, even though they may be in development. It does not include phase 1 trials or drugs in preclinical testing (not enough info to be worthwhile). It does not include supplements, or already approved medications being repurposed (like levetiracetam, telmisartan) or reformulations of existing medication as an injectable or sublingual. It does not include other therapies like rTMS. Maybe I will try to do a list of those later. These studies are currently listed on clinicaltrials.gov as: 1. Active, not recruiting, 2. Enrolling by invitation, 3. Recruiting, or 4. Not yet recruiting. Drug name: SEP-363856 Mechanism of action: a novel trace amine associated receptor-1 (TAAR1)/5-HT1A agonist with no dopamine-D2/5-HT2A antagonist activity Proposed to treat: Acute psychosis Phase: 3 Estimated study end date(s): October 2021, March 2022, November 2022, June 30, 2025 (multiple studies
) Notes: The results from the phase 2 study were good. The primary analysis showed a significant reduction in LS mean PANSS total score for SEP-363856 vs. placebo at week 4 (-17.2 vs. -9.7; P=0.001; effect size = 0.45). Significant reduction for SEP-363856 was also observed on the CGI-S (clinical global impression) and BNSS (Brief Negative Symptom Scale) total score. Effects on weight, lipids, glucose, prolactin, ECG and extrapyramidal symptoms were similar to placebo. Adverse events occurring with an incidence ?2% on SEP-363856 vs. placebo were: somnolence (6.7% vs. 4.8%), agitation (5.0% vs. 4.8%), nausea (5.0% vs. 3.2%), diarrhea (2.5% vs. 0.8%), and dyspepsia (2.5% vs. 0%). Drug name: Pimavanserin Mechanism of action: selective inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor Proposed to treat: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia Phase: 3 Estimated study end date(s): March 2023, March 2024, January 2025 Notes: Pimavanerin is approved for Parkinson’s psychosis, but was recently rejected for dementia relat
ed psychosis. (The FDA said it was not statistically significant in some dementia subgroups). The results of the phase 2 schizophrenia study showed significant improvement in the NSA-16 (negative symptom assessment) but no significant change in the Personal and Social Performance Scale score. One analyst says of the drug that is is at the “low end of the range” for efficacy as an atypical anti-psychotic. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred among 39.8% and 35.1% of patients in the pimavanserin and placebo groups, respectively, with headache and somnolence as the most common. Drug name: NaBen Mechanism of action: Enhances the glutamate-NDMA receptor function by inhibiting the degredation of D-serine by DAAO (D-amino acid oxidase) Proposed to treat: As an add on to current medication, the primary measurement of the study is PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) Phase: 2/3 Estimated study end date: December 2021 Notes: The company website says that they have preliminary clinical data showing NaB
en can improve negative symptoms, cognitive symptoms, and further reduce positive symptoms. There is another study running concurrently on NaBen with clozapine. http://www.syneurx.com/en/snd13/ Drug name: KarXT (Xanomeline and Trospium Chloride) Mechanism of action: M-1-M4 muscarinic agonist Proposed to treat: Schizophrenic psychosis. The drug is also being developed for negative and cognitive symptoms, it is in an earlier phase. Phase: 3 Estimated study end date(s): January 2022, February 2022, June 2023, July 2023 Notes: Most common side effects in the phase 2 study were nausea and constipation, which largely resolved after the first week. The phase 2 study found a larger improvement in cognition in those who had more severe cognitive impairments. Drug name: AVP-786 , a deuterated, second-generation version of AVP-923/Nuedexta Mechanism of action: a weak antagonist of NMDA receptors, and an agonist of sigma 1 receptors Proposed to treat: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia Phase: 2/3 Estimated study end date

Drug name: MK-8189 Mechanism of action: PDE10A inhibitor Proposed to treat: Acute schizophrenia Phase: 2 Estimated study end date: July 2022 Notes: Drug is being compared to placebo as well as risperidone Drug name: Cannabidiol Mechanism of action: undetermined/possibly anandamide regulation Proposed to treat: One study is of cannabidiol as a maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as an add-on to antipsychotic, the other compares it to olanzapine and to placebo. There is an additional study of cannabidiol in early psychosis ending Dec 2021, and another ending June 2023. Phase: 2 Estimated study end date(s): December 2021 March 2023 Notes: This might be considered a supplement but I am going to go ahead and include it as a drug. Drug name: BI-425809 + cognitive training Mechanism of action: Gly-T1 inhibitor Proposed to treat: Cognitive impairment Phase: 2 Estimated study end date: April 2022 Notes: Study tests the drug pl
us cognitive training vs placebo plus cognitive training. All patients are required to be stable on 1-2 antipsychotics, excluding clozapine. There were 2 studies, the first study, 1346.9 was a study of the drug as an add-on to exisiting medication, but without cognitive training. The earlier study is reported to have met its primary endpoint, improvement in cognition. Five of six dose–response models showed a statistically significant benefit of BI 425809 over placebo https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30513-7/fulltext The second (this one) is study 1346.38 and includes the addition of cognitive training. Drug name: BI-409306 Mechanism of action: PDE9A inhibitor / glutamatergic neurotransmission Proposed to treat: Prevention of relapse in schizophrenia, prevention of conversion to psychosis in attenuated psychosis syndrome Phase: 2 Estimated study end date(s): March 2021, April 2021 Notes: The same drug did not improve cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in an earlier trial
. Drug name: RO6889450 Ralmitaront Mechanism of action: Partial TAAR1 agonist Proposed to treat: Acute Exacerbation of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, negative symptoms Phase: 2 Estimated study end date(s): December 2022, April 2023 Notes: studies for acute exacerbation and negative symptoms are separate trials but running concurrently. Drug name: RL-007 Mechanism of action: modulator of cholinergic, NMDA and GABA type B receptor systems Proposed to treat: Cognitive impairment – this study is a safety and biomarker study Phase: 2 Estimated study end date: September 2021 Notes: atai Life Sciences Acquires Majority Stake in Recognify Life Sciences to Develop Novel Treatment for Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia RL-007 preliminarily exhibited pro-cognitive effects on exploratory endpoints in pain patients, an experimental cognitive paradigm, and healthy volunteers. Preclinically, it demonstrated pro-cognitive effects in healthy young animals, age-associated memory loss, and models o
f cholinergic-deficits. RL-007 also showed anxiolytic properties in animal models of unconditioned anxiety. Finally, it has been shown to enhance long term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices, indicating a direct action on mechanisms and brain regions involved with learning and memory processes. Drug name: BIIB-104 , also known as PF-_PHONE_NO_ Mechanism of action: Positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the AMPA receptor, glyicine reuptake inhibitor Proposed to treat: Cognitive impairment Phase: 2 Estimated study end date: June 2021 Notes: – Drug name: PF-_PHONE_NO_ Mechanism of action: Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor Proposed to treat: Cognitive impairment Phase: 2 Estimated study end date: December 2021 Notes: – Follow ups from my May 2019 list that are not already covered above: Lumateperone/Caplyta/ITI-007 was approved and is available in many markets. Lumateperone is a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, partial agonist of presynaptic D2 receptors and an antagonist of postsynaptic D2 receptors, se
rotonin transporter blocker with affinity for the D1 receptor and lower affinity for the Alpha-1A_adrenergic_receptor and Alpha-1B_adrenergic_receptor 5-HT2C receptor and D4 receptor, with indirect glutamatergic modulation. It is said to have a better side effect profile than most D2 antipsychotics. Roluperidone/MIN-101 did not meet its endpoints in it’s phase 3 study ended June 2020. _NAME_ counters that the combination of the phase 2 and 3 studies show effectiveness and warrants an NDA submission. However, the phase 2 study did not use the commercial formulation of roluperidone, and there were problems with at least one of the study sites. At this time it is down, but not necessarily out. Roluperidone is being studied as a monotherapy for primarily negative symptoms of schizophrenia. FDA acknowledged that the data from the Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies appear to show promising signals and encouraged _NAME_ to continue the development of roluperidone for treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, whic
h FDA confirmed is an unmet need. _NAME_ intends to continue development and NDA activities consistent with FDA’s December 2019 draft guidance. Evenamide. Newron successfully completed an additional safety study requested by the FDA. [Evenamide] has a unique mechanism of action: glutamate modulation and voltage-gated sodium channel blockade. Evenamide modulates sustained repetitive firing, without inducing impairment of normal neuronal excitability. It normalizes glutamate release induced by aberrant sodium channel activity. In a Phase IIa clinical study, Newron demonstrated evenamide’s evidence of efficacy in significantly improving symptoms of psychosis compared with placebo when added to two of the most commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics in patients with chronic schizophrenia. No patient on evenamide discontinued from the study due to adverse events, and there were no significant adverse events relating to evenamide. No symptoms were observed suggestive of severe CNS events, symptoms/signs of 
seizures, EEG diagnosis of seizure like activity, or cardiac events in patients with evenamide. There were no differences in laboratory, ECG or vital signs abnormalities between evenamide and placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse events reported (greater than 5%) were headache and somnolence, which were equally distributed between evenamide and placebo.

174343938,"you sound like me with college and investment banking. i put all my eggs in 1 basket and wanted to make it in life and have it all – money, women, and power. Unforutnately, it never happened despite my potential and intelligence. I wasn’t perfect. I drank energy drinks but not like I do now. A lot less. I have severe negs too. I tried many different supplements and even tried building a mining rig when bitcoin was like 500 a coin or something but it never worked. i felt bad about using all my money on a nice gpu and it was DOA I think. I could have been rich but hindsight is 20/20. makes me think I’m incompetent when it comes to computers. i never had sex or a girlfriend and was always focused on school and was extremely naive, pickey, and arrogant and even entitled according to my brother. I had all the traits of self endulgence and narcissism, I guess. I was a flawed character and I have trauma but I feel hopeful I can get better. My life was destroyed and may never recover but I found God 
and even get to experience some pleasure in life and some hope I can recover a bit and make money and go to school online and learn programming. i enjoy math, science, and computers. i’ve never been on a date or anything. never hugged or kissed or held hands with a girl but it was my extremely low self esteem and focus on achievement. i think i got aspergers and all the hot girls were taken and my life was screwed because I didn’t look the part. I didn’t know how to dress myself properly and I usually shaved my head a lot and I was really pale/white and nerdy and even schizo like schizotypal personality disorder. Before schizophrenia, I would laugh, talk to myself, make funny faces, etc. I was a strange boy. Latuda and Caplyta are great as well as Vraylar for negs and cognition. But for some reason I have a severe case maybe even treatment resistant. I have all sorts of theories like once you go into conspiracy theories, they just keep you disabled. In a past life, I had delusions I got into a PhD progr
am in physics at Stanford but didn’t finish because my schizophrenia came back and maybe it terminated as a masters. I thought the med started with an L which makes me think Latuda or Lumateperone but things never worked out or repeated in infinite hell. I don’t know if it was even real, just online, or something. But I recovered somewhat and worked my ass off in physics. I have a lower than normal IQ but I’m smart in some ways and creative. I sound like a crazy person but I think I achieved my dream in a past life. I don’t really have memories or enough of them to remember being on campus and going to class except having visions of Susskind and learning physics and getting a internship and being a researcher there working in high energy physics. But I think it’s all fake and my imagination and fantasy. I often feel like I’m repeating life and stuff. I also have memories of going to MIT (even getting rejected) and getting into Harvard. It’s many worlds theory but somehow I get dreams and flashba
cks and fantasies of such life. I remember bits and pieces due to monster drinks and psychosis, I guess. I also went to lesser known schools and sometimes had a good time. For some reason, it’s all luck, bad luck, and probabilities. I feel like I’m in a time loop but also I will avoid trying to achieve these things again. I couldn’t even pass undergrad in math."

176008810,I am stable and well at the moment. I have not had positives for a long time thankfully. I have had relapses though and know I am sensitive so I need to live stress and drama free as possible and avoid people that are trouble. I was off medication and had a relapse and was hospitalised. I have had a few relapses. Hope I never get it that bad ever again. I decided to stay on my medication because it took my delusions away and I believe helps keep me stable. I get a bit hated by some but not at all as bad as it was in Sweden you couldn’t get more hated and disrespected than I was.

174343946,"(First of all, I made this topic in the Unusual Beliefs section, but I still don’t know if the sound is a hallucination or not. “Part 1” of this thing can be found in the 2nd paragraph of this thread: https://forum.schizophrenia.com/t/strange-sounds/177096 ) I managed to roughly reproduce the “alien” sound that is coming from the apartment upstairs, using online tone generator and some movie editing software: This is roughly the sound that apparently made me angry for some reason (which may not have happened as it could have been a fake memory). Note that the sound that I heard is more quiet than that (which may be the reason why I couldn’t record it with my phone), and it also has some “vibrance” to it. That vibrance would be much more difficult to reproduce however. I’ve noticed that as of recent the sound only appears when a car is passing by ( before it used to repeat in uneven intervals for a long time ). Not sure why, maybe what’s causing this sound (could be either a hall
ucination, or some real thing - I don’t know) is now trying to “hide” it into the noise. Note that any noise does not work - when scratching my head or moving my body in the bed the noise will not trigger that sound (even if the noise is roughly as loud as the cars make), so far only cars passing by are triggering it. That seems to support the theory that there is actually something weird going on in the apartment upstairs - whatever thing is making that sound there couldn’t hear me scratching my head, so if it wants to hide the sound it will have to use the cars’ noise. Either that, or it’s a hallucination and in this case my “schizophrenia” is even more strange - as mentioned, I heard that sound long before the onset of my schizophrenia, and it would be the only hallucination I heard before that onset, and it must have been a recurring hallucination (I heard it many times - each time the same sound, only heard from my bedroom, and always coming from the apartment upstairs)."

This study aims to investigate the risk of HCE in diabetic patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, the duration of antipsychotic use on the risk of HCE is examined.- A total of 13858 diabetic patients with schizophrenia and 55407 controls (without schizophrenia) matched by gender, age, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score were included between 1999 and 2010 and followed to the end of 2013 using from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. During the follow-up period, participants who developed HCE were identified. _PERSON_ regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio 
(HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the HCE incidence rate between the two groups studied.- Diabetic patients with schizophrenia were associated with an increased risk of HCE compared with unaffected controls after adjusted for baseline demographics and duration of antipsychotic use (4.73 versus 2.43 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.85-2.51). Also, in diabetic patients with schizophrenia, a longer duration of antipsychotic use was associated with a lower risk of HCE after adjustment for the above-mentioned variables, suggesting a protective effect of antipsychotics against HCE during prolonged use.- This study highlights the need to pay more attention to the risk of HCE in diabetic patients with schizophrenia and the importance of proper use of antipsychotics may reduce the risk of HCE.

176008917,"Hey guys. I started getting invega injections (had several others before; medication doesn’t seem to work for me) on March 1st 2020 and my last was May 1st 2020. Had 2 156mg and 1 117 mg. I have sexual side effects that I won’t go into detail about, have flattened emotions, and can’t get high or drunk. I’m curious to know how long it took people to recover, how many shots you had at what mg, who is still in recovery, and how long you’ve been in recovery for. Not many people seem to really have the answers, and alot of people are looking to know how long it takes to recover. I had to dig deep to find the some answers. Average was 6 months, or atleast noticed a significant change at 6 months. I’ve read that the makers of Invega said that it’s supposed to last 6 months. I’m hoping to create a thread that spreads awareness towards Invega Sustenna recovery and has more answers than questions. Am also hoping this can be found on the first page of Google so people have an easier time findi
ng recovery estimates. The only link I could find on the first page had 976 replies and only like 6 of those being about people who have recovered. As far as I know, the more shots you have and how many you’ve had, and I think your metabolism, will play a role in how long it takes to recover. Take care."

174343981,"I wonder the same thing. Currently it’s labeled as psychosis, and in my opinion even if there were a case of a schizophrenic psychically communicating, it would be covered up. One thing I wonder is if it’s maybe a form of spiritual communication or something. Whatever it is, I think the goal is to find harmony with it and help others find harmony too."
176009020,I struggle with it too… I try to only fill up glasses half way and sip them slower. Also avoid salty foods.

176009113,"I was at the park today, enjoying a soda and listening to Revolver in my car. I was kind of half keeping an eye out for what was going on around me. About a month ago I was parked at night near my house at a deserted shopping center. It had shut down and went out of business so sometimes I just go in the parking lot to get out of the house when I need space. A _NAME_ with a young girl drove by and she looks at me and I looked at her. And then she kept driving close and she had some guy with her. IDK what their trip was but after awhile I just glared and they got pissed and there was a little standoff. They decided to leave and. I admit it made me nervous and. I left. It could have been ugly and I thought. I could have handled it better. So today, the exact same thing happened. A _NAME_ with a teen girl and a guy drove by. But I learned from the past incident. They went by once and I thought it was innocent. I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Then they came by a second time. I remembered the last 
time so I didn’t glare or try to scare them. I caught their eye and gave them a look like, “You’re cool, but I’m a little suspicious.” And then they drove by a third time and I caught their eye and they acted like it was a coincidence and they tried to play dumb and. I was only 50% sure they were thinking of me. Then they drove by a fourth time acting like it had nothing to do with me. By this time I knew they were very suspicious and they were driving all around the big parking lot. I just said screw it, I tried to respect them and they’re playing for a fool so I stared and glared at them and threw in some laughter for good measure. Idiots. They parked and I thought it was over with but by this time I didn’t trust them worth a damn. A fifth time and I just stared at them unmistakeably like they were crazy and lame. It finally ended and they left. I have to admit it bugged me but it was kind of fun making fools of them."
176009114,"Yeah, lots of people were really nice to me in AA. That was big factor in my staying in recovery in the beginning of my sobriety. As time went on, I think some people didn’t know what to make of me and a friend who used to come with me to meetings. We got treated OK and met some really tough characters but they tried to take it easy on us. I remember some people would scare us but still be friendly. In fact, my friends sponsor was a really, mellow, nice guy but you didn’t fool around with him or bug him. I still think back on some members who seemed so friendly but were scary people. So scary that it was very confusing if they liked us or not."
174344008,"So when I’m on medication and in remission I’m totally normal I can see why some people stop taking their medication,because I feel totally fine. If I wasn’t on medication I wouldn’t be schizophrenic. Anyone else experience full remission."

It seems I pretty much just stay the same unless I do fasting days, which is really dumb since I don’t really want to do this long term. But I guess I will if I need to. I only lost 5 pounds last month, which is still progress, so not really complaining, but it still sucks that it’s definitely slowed down and is much harder to lose now. Going to really have to step up my effort to lose the rest of this weight."

174344010,"Weed doesn’t cause SZ unless you abuse it or if you use it regularly and you have SZ genes. I learned in my psy courses that weed can indeed cause psychosis and worsen schizophrenia; it might cause SZ if you have SZ genes. My friend’s friend abused weed and started thinking that the FBI are trying to kill him by poisoning his food. He got better when he stopped though. I didn’t because my SZ is genetic, SZ is 80% genetic. I definitely get psychosis when I use weed regularly, my psychosis gets more violent too so I stopped, deleted and blocked those bad friends that were also using cocaine. I got bad friends since I was on Abilify which caused me addiction to anything including hookers and gambling, its a side effect. All this stopped when I switched to Latuda. Also note that there is different types of weed, high THC are the worst for SZ. Low THC high CBD are actually good for SZ because CBD is a natural antipsychotic."

176009211,"Lately I’ve increasingly felt like some unseen entity/force controls the flow of things in my life. It controls the people around me, and also how I interact with the world. Because of this, I feel that the arbitrary nature of things has no longer exists. It’s like something other than me governs my whole reality. Someone else is in charge and they do whatever they want to me. The primary cause of these feelings is all the seemingly uncanny synchronicities and coincidences I experience. They feel very deliberate and undeniable, like someone/something is doing it all on purpose, trying to send me a message. More so, the other reason is the predictability of things. They always seem to happen the way I think it will. Things feel too convenient, sometimes calculated and impeccably timed. I’m missing the natural flow of things that life once had.

My brothers beat up anyone talking bad or approaching their gf or me. I try to be confident but my mind voice forces me to do the opposite.

176009248,"It’s pretty much a certainty that this is not the case. But you had enough sense of yourself to seek the opinion of others. I had a bit of a similar downward spiral of thinking a few weeks ago. Those paranoid delusions are tough to kick, and they can get really, really bad. One thing I noticed was the more I let my delusion heighten my sense of self-importance, the more that I felt that sense of paranoia. Which makes sense - important people have a lot more attention on them. So maybe approach it from that angle? What do you bring to the table that the CIA would require? Is the value of that thing so strong that they would completely break protocol just for you, given that a bit of research on the topic would show that generally they recruit from colleges or the military via the teachers/officers who spot talent. One of the notable delusions are delusions of reference - the idea that there are messages in things everyone can see that are specifically meant for you. So what’s more likely - that 
you are so important to the CIA that they would do things totally different from their entire history of recruitment operations just for you, or that you are having a delusion of reference? If you want an exercise that helped me with some of these ideas, take a coin, stare at it, and then make yourself feel more positive about it. Think about how it might have brought joy to other people, etc. Then switch and think more negatively about it. Think about how it is dirty or old and represents base desires. Then come back to just thinking of it as a normal coin. The coin doesn’t change at all, but your experience of it does. You can do this same exercise with how important or unimportant the coin is, or even both at the same time - important and positive, not important but still positive, important and negative, not-important and negative. You can also do it with things that aren’t coins. Including how you feel about yourself or the reality around you. It’s tough at first, and initially it’s hard to contr
ol, especially as you spiral in on negative thoughts that just snowball. But I practiced it with the coin every day for a few weeks and noticed I was better able to apply the technique to my thoughts - it ended up being a skill just like any other that got easier with practice. I guess it’s a bit like lucid dreaming while awake. Unlike in a dream you can’t change the physical reality around you, but you can change how you experience that reality. And just like when you are dreaming and have a nightmare that would otherwise get worse and worse, but then the skills of lucid dreaming help take over and change the dream, I’ve been finding more and more that I’m able to change my perspective about things in my day to day with some effort. That said, it would still be prudent to talk to your psychiatrist about these delusions. Changing drugs/dosages can help a great deal in reducing the “range” of what your mind experiences about reality, which is important if you find yourself spiraling out of control.

She said the lime disease effected nerve endings on her vocal chords. So she lost her voice. And on top of that around the same time her husband cheated on her with her best friend. So it just proves that anybody can experience problems.

176009271,"I’ll don’t know if I go back to vaping anytime soon. I wouldn’t quit tobacco for health reasons anyway. Still got a sub ohm vape and a pod system at home. As I remember my vaping behaviour it was a tragedy. It was smoky in the room fully, the windows needed to be always open, both of them, even in the coldest times in winter, 24/7. But I need to do that too with tobacco most of the time, because it stanks and is so smoky. I would have to order online, anyways probably vaping is not getting me hooked."

I looked a little bit into it and they don’t allow anyone with mental health problems to do it. Also I am single so I think that is also an obstacle. I should look more into it though. because I also have my earlychildhood education diploma so I am use to children. I have been stable for 3 years but maybe in the future rules may change.

Same with _PERSON_. It’s just not physically possible for them to be projecting their voices to your home, and still have time to meet you on the road.

176009311,Most of the people I’ve met have some kind of potential. You may not see it in yourself but someone else may see it in you. Do your parents or maybe even your brothers encourage you in any way? When I was 23 or 24 I had no plans to get a job. But counselors at the vocational program I was in saw something in me and gave me small opportunities to have responsibilities that eventually led to me getting a steady job that I stayed four years at. If you have a good therapist or doctor they can help you find your strengths and maybe you could start improving your life.

174344066,Exercise is supposed to help. Also a supplement caled NAC is supposed to help according to some trials. I tried NAC and it seems to interact with abilify in a very bad way. So if you’re on abilify I wouldn’t recommend NAC.
176009325,"In my opinion there are 4 reasons why a person denies being psychotic. They are so incredibly ill they do not have the cognitive capability to understand that what they are experiencing may not be real They are afraid that not believing in their delusions may put them or people they love in danger somehow (ex believing meds are poison, even if you tell yourself its a delusion, you may be scared to test it because in your mind if it is NOT a delusion, taking those meds may kill you!) Giving up the delusion means facing painful feelings. An example: a homeless person believes they are a famous millionaire (i have seen this many times before). Facing the truth that they are homeless and have nothing is extremely painful. The delusion is more tantalizing. Or for someone who believes they have special powers, realizing they are not so special may be painful. It is more tempting to want to believe you are unique and in a way better than others. We just don’t like the idea of being called “crazy”. W
e don’t want to be associated with the label “psychotic”. When in reality it is nothing to be ashamed of, it is an illness like any other that can be managed."

Me and my sister have lots of fun shopping to look forward to. I will miss a few things but will have so much fun replacing them. I just can’t decide if I want to go new or antique. My sister says I will know when I see it."
176009397,Glad to hear you’re doing well with your piano _AT_MENTION_ !
176009398,No you feel like a prophet.
176009399,Ask yourself what kind of breakthrough symptoms you have now and negatives? If pills are shutting you down Why? Geez I talk a mile minute!
176009400,Yeah. Paranoia got worse on it for me.
176009401,I take metoprolol which is similar. Keeps my heart calm.
176009402,My idea of myself is unreal if you look at me physically. It feels like a lack of nerve development that my head just didn’t fill out when I was born.
176009403,"One time I was going into this nine story complex of doctor’s offices and sleeping on the ninth floor landing. Then one night I went down to the second floor and there were boxes and boxes and boxes of medical samples. I recognized a couple of them as the kind of drugs we have to take. There was also food stashed in a small refridgerator and other places. I helped myself to that. I think it was some kind of nurse’s station. I didn’t mess with any of the drugs. I did call a crisis line from the nurse’s station and chewed the fat with them for a while. When I think about some of the places I’ve slept I think it would be worth the extra weight to carry a strong flash light. I got to thinking that there could be scorpions or centapides in some of them. One time I was sleeping in a burned down lumber mill in _NAME_, _NAME_, and I heard this coyote’s howl off away from the railroad tracks. Then I heard them yapping as they were coming towards me. I didn’t run, because I’ve heard that any 
time you run when canines are bothering you they get much more aggressive. I’ve carried pepper spray at times when I was on the street. That stuff terrifies dogs. It would probably be a catastrophic mistake to pepper spray a pit bull, because that would probably trigger its rage reaction."
176009404,I have tried to suicide over a million times…
176009405,When I was a child I loved myself and then now it has become challenging why is that. I think it’s the case for many people
174344084,"I have been up since 3:30am. Hoping it’s not the 5mg of Aripiprazole I was put on to reduce my prolactin Probably the main reason is my back pain I wrote a thread about. It seems not too bad once I move around a bit, but when I wake up my ribs and back are very tender. Today I break a non-weekend working rule I made for myself, but the job shouldn’t take long. I am repairing a brick wall"

176009408,"Yes, 600mg Seroquel, I work out."
176009409,I tried a lot of non suntheanine brands. Some from Europe and some from the USA. Some pharmaceutical grade and some not. Long term consistent use always led to mysterious aches and pains. So it’s a suntheanine brand for me now.
176009410,Yeah that is true but when you are more creative your brain tends to overanalyze things and then you are overwhelmed with thought
176009411,"Yes, I am homicidal and suicidal without my meds. It sucks."
174344092,"I began with schizophrenia when I was 20. I was feeling bad so me and my brother moved from where we were living in London to a relative’s house to have me checked out. I had my first episode while at the relative’s house, I jumped out of a window and hit the ground. After I was rushed to a hospital and then to a psychiatric hospital. I had been put on medication while in London and I still blame that for inducing the schizophrenia later in time."
176009412,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_-spray Thanks guys! Im really happy you like it, Ive wanted to do something like this for awhile since I love guitar _AT_MENTION_ Do it man you will not regret it. Get FL Studio or Ableton or something, even the free demo. Its done wonders for my mental state making and sharing full songs and not just noodling around on guitar or piano"
176009413,I’d disagree it has opened a lot of doors for me work is inclusive these days and sometimes you can have a chat with the boss and not let your co workers in on anything to do with an illness that gives you the edge as the ‘capable’ ‘disability quota’ i have always carried shame but it’s okay to find yourself more comfortable among people who are just a bit more understanding even if they would call themselves ‘not 100%’

176009416,"oh i would find it so hard to live on myself. I rely on my parents for most stuff… i don’t think i would make it on my own. I fear the day when they can’t take care of me anymore, dunno what will happen then. They keep saying one of my siblings will take me in then but i dunno if that will be possible."
176009417,"I acted and talked pretty normally, even at the beginning at my worst. My suffering was in my head. Even when I was hospitalized for 8 months they would let me out for daily 20 minute walks to the store and nobody could tell anything was wrong with me. I went on weekend passes all the time to spent two or three days and nights with my parents and we went to restaurants, or the bookstore or just about anywhere and no one gave me a second look or looked at me weirdly or anything. But I thought some pretty bizarre crap though I’ve never heard voices. My hygiene was fine, I dressed nice and I could be on a crowded bus with no one knowing anything was wrong with me. But I was severely ill for about 2 1/2 years, that’s why I spent 8 months in the psychiatric hospital. I was fairly quiet, sometimes I talked a lot sometimes I didn’t. If I’m with family you can’t shut me up."
176009418,"You really don’t know how an extra dose is going to affect you. It could possibly help but the odds are just as good that it could cause trouble of it’s own. I’ve never taken Latuda (I don’t even like that name for some reason) but it was a huge mistake when I took an extra 5 mgs of prolixen on my own. It was horrible. And when I accidentally doubled up on my risperidone about 4 years ago, I thought I would end up in the psyche ward. IDK what else to tell you. I wouldn’t risk it, but that’s just my opinion. How about taking a Benadryl or some other OTC sleep aid? But then you would have to find out before you take it how it would interact with your AP’s or any other vitamin or medication you take. There’s no way to reach your doc? Can you do stuff to relax you and calm yourself down without an extra dose? Maybe take a relaxing bath. A hot bath can help you sleep. Maybe someone could take you out for a drive until you feel sleepy? Or listen to soothing music? Maybe get in your pajama
s and have a cup of hot chocolate on the couch with dimmed lights? A warm drink sure makes me drowsy."
176009419,Maybe? I’ve also heard that it might be genetic.
176009420,A crisis center can probably help you
176009421,You alright? 1515
176009422,I took the plunge and ordered a bottle right now. I spoke with my mother about it before I did and she was very supportive. She told me “Why wait?” Hah. Thanks a bunch _AT_MENTION_ . Now this is a dumb question… I’m supposed to take 3 capsules daily for it to be effective?

I feel like giving up, I sort of want to go to the hospital but I’m scared to go because I haven’t been in so long I don’t know even which hospital around here takes my insurance. I don’t know if the hospital would even help. I feel lost and hopeless."

His response was rejection obviously as we’re both with significant others, but he also told me not to worry about it— “it happens” he said (that was 5 months ago) and we’re still friends and we still talk, but my feelings/thoughts towards him remain unchanged… and i still see numbers/songs as signs and its all very convoluted in my brain."

176009456,"I think the odd number of possibility is not that much different from people without mental illness It’s not impossible for people with mental illness to commit a crime, but people tend to focus on the wrong point Fake example this is not real nor really happen like children commit crime because they got bullied/abused, they had asked for help but no one care, no one want to put themselve in someone else problem even police or social service who supposed to help They got abused to the point they develop something like depression/anxiety/PTSD(just an example since it can happen to everyone so no bias directly toward any person) So they fight back because there’s no other way out Justice is just some words and law don’t equal justice With my personal experience, even If you got abused but have no evidence no one can help or believe in you, let alone word justice what do you think it will happen? It become and news people give in their interest Investigation come after “Oh we found out this ch
ild have PTSD” news come out “Wahh they might be psychopath” “Ew mental ill!” Do they care about what is that child going through? do they care police and social service ignore their cry for help? NO “why did they done that!? normal people wouldn’t do that” so they tend to blame on something they don’t know enough or understand some even called mental ills abnormal and why is that? example in example lol fear of darkness. no not everone afraid of it because you can’t see anything, you don’t know what is might be in the dark maybe there’s nothing but you can’t know, and sometime brain will do silly thing when you go into the room in the dark without turn the light on in usual case you would walking more carefully right? humans tend to be wary or even scared demonized something they don’t know or understand like said someone is witch and burn them in past how many innocent life was killed? so there’re some of them just criminal who happen to have mental illness but people without e
ducation in psychology might focus on mental disorder blame on it with many media, protray evil characters with mental ill why? many trash writing is because the author themselve can’t find reasonable excuse for their evil character to act or take action the way they do “I want to write this character evil but I can’t explain why oh let make them mental ill so I don’t have to explain!” and then people who don’t know anything read or watch this trash and get misinformation and think mental illness mean bad people when there’s a new with criminal who have mental illness, they tend to put this dot together and more and more and more _USER_ID_ I can write longer but let stop here thanks for waste you time reading my silly reply I should just say _USER_ID_ lol"

Here in Australia we had more black deaths in custody than South Africa during apatheid. Yes. You can only be accountable for your actions now but the past matters and absolving blame is a slippery slope to justifying poor behavior.

I’d get a thought to do something and I’d do it. Then came all the mess…and now it’s like I think of something and almost inevitably I don’t want to do it and thinking of doing it exhausts me and stresses me out. Everything is a big deal that requires tremendous effort on my part. I am similar to what you described if I want to do something I have to really NOT think about all the steps involved because I get overwhelmed by them (for example brushing teeth I do not just think I need to go brush my teeth I think oh God first I have to get up, then I have to walk to the bathroom, then I have to brush my teeth, then I have to floss, then I have to come back to the room, and suddenly this very simple task is a ton of tasks and it is too much to deal with even though none of those tasks should actually be difficult in theory).

176009528,"https://www.psychcongress.com/article/limitations-and-promise-genetic-testing-psychiatry Genetic testing may be a helpful tool in diagnosing autism and intellectual disability, but published data does not adequately support its use as a standard predictor of antidepressant response, _NAME_, MD, MPH, said during a session at the virtual 2020 Psych Congress Elevate conference on the role of genetic testing in psychiatry. I think it’s equally bogus for AP response prediction."

176009531,I’m in the UK too. My psychiatrist has never told me about anything like that I might ask.
176009532,Very similar to what happened to me leading up to psychosis. I took a lot of LSD and those are similar hallucinations to what I had. After I quit taking LSD the visual hallucinations didn’t stop. One day it was like a switch went off in my head and the visual hallucinations stopped but turned to auditory instead. It just kept getting worse and worse. I thought after I stopped drugs it would go away but it didn’t.
176009533,hmm. part of the reasoning may be “not making anyone feel better.”
174344108,"At least 30 years. I started having religious delusions/hallucinations when I was 30. The summer of 1980 I smoked some pot with a friend and had a psychotic break that lasted until January 1981 when I went in the psych ward. A clean, reformed drug user who was working with my mom said it sounded like there was some PCP in the pot I smoked. I thought that was the reason, but that might have been the start of my SzA. If so, I’ve had it for 40 years."
176009534,Son? Go to the emergency room or call the crisis team. Don’t suffer alone. We all need help when we get to feeling this way. You don’t need to suffer alone. Please seek help. I love you and want you to be safe.

176009537,"IMHO I think it is considered a sin in certain circles because the culture hasn’t had time to change, it is an old idea. Two thousand years ago it might have been very easy to ruin your, or someone else’s life by having a child out of wedlock. However, birth control, ability to raise a child independently, and people not seeing marriage as a commodity are at a few strong reasons it doesn’t hold water anymore. There may be other good reasons to wait to have sex until marriage though."

176009560,"That’s my experience too. If you can easily do x and yet flunk y you’re more like to be described as lazy,obstructive etc rather than it be seen as a cognitive issue that needs addressing. My own weak areas are planning,non- verbal memory, spatial perception(that has improved but is comparatively weak compared to my verbal ability) , visual short term memory. II can have days when I’m mentally as sharp as can be, and days when I’m struggling to organise my thoughts. My autobiographical memory is quite poor, and certain things that come naturally to most people don’t for me. For example brushing my teeth and taking oral meds…Both are long term. Going on depot was due to the poor record with oral meds. At 63 there is a greater personal concern about dementia than there was a decade ago. I actually had my 1st test for signs of MCI/ dementia at my recent video consultation. Thankfully I did OK."

176009567,"Obviously, physicians are more important and vital to our society. But basketball is a skill and includes god-given talent/genetics (height, athleticism, jumping ability), whereas medicine is more of a trade (it does require skill, but this can be learned).

Imagine the medications block dopamine and you go off them even taper but it’s not a long enough taper and imagine all that dopamine being freed and causing a rush.

I cry a lot and get very emotional and angry euphoric sad hysterical off them. So I’m. Stuck for life on meds I’m sure. But there’s worse things to dea with. Imagine being a burn victim or something. Abilify is a great med compared to some other ones. But it can cause gambling and shopping so just keep an eye on it. When I took it psychiatrist wasn’t aware it can cause gambling even though I came up with that conclusion after losing a bunch of money. I looked it up and there was class action lawsuits so just be aware

174344124,"Does it really improves negative and cognitive symptoms like Wikipedia says? “Based on its exceptionally high, unequaled (among antipsychotics) affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and very high affinity for the ?2 and H1 receptors, asenapine, given normal tolerability, should theoretically demonstrate among the highest improvements in the negative symptomology of schizophrenia among all current antipsychotics (August 2017), such as high cognitive improvements and positive, stable mood maintenance.” en.wikipedia.org Asenapine Asenapine, sold under the trade names Saphris and Sycrest among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.

174344125,"Some people have it pretty easy. I respect women and women rights but women have it easier when it comes to schizophrenia. They have the estrogen theory. I once read a Harvard girl got really sick and couldn’t read at all, ended up going back to Harvard not much later and graduating. _PERSON_ had it easier than Nash in my opinion. I sometimes don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I am scared sometimes and have fear. Some real, some not so much. It’s hard to know what’s real when you remember everything and remember nothing. I also remember past lives in other universes so I remember more based on volume than this life. Maybe life before 2012 wasn’t real and only I remember. I keep going to other realities and stuff. Mainly after I die. For some reason my consciousness came back to this one and into my body is my best guess. The voices want me to blame some group or some people or some entity but I don’t know. The voices say I died over 9000 times about and it never ends. Sometimes 
my mind was wiped completely others not so much. I pretty much remember everything and it’s ??????? hard to live. Sometimes I feel there are no conspiracies because they’ll all real to some extent. I feel like karma is hitting the evil people in the face for once. Can’t do much when the whole universe and planet and simulators are after me ruining my life. I’m just a fat debilitated person with little to no future that wants something in life. I feel like a bag of meat just existing and wasting life away. I have no purpose except to get that degree if they let me and learn and make some money. I suffer 24/7 with headaches and memory now. No dissociation. Some people think dissociation protects the brain from trauma and stuff and memories and maybe God doesn’t want us to remember, but I remember some of it. I feel like CCC (Conformal Cyclic Cosmology) and M Theory are true. There’s computer code with M Theory. Last, I think Many Worlds Theory is true. We live in an ancestor simulation. There’s a 
lot of them maybe thousands being run by our ancestors. There’s a wall or brick wall preventing me from going back to my childhood. I must be a clone, but then clones don’t last 10+ years, right? I often felt worthless like my life was only with 10 bucks at most maybe a dollar. I often think if I didn’t have the trauma or memories, I wouldn’t have the headaches and addiction and even be disabled. It’s like my mind is flooded with memories. I cannot even think anymore with all the paranoia. I don’t know if I’m just looping back in time or resetting the simulation when I die. I don’t know. I do remember making back before 2010 but I was dissociated, barely had any consciousness, and was probably turned into a p-zombie by the aliens/computer simulators. They can capture someone’s consciousness and send it back and forward through time, which is what they did to me. If I could wake up, go back in time, and relive my life with memories and awareness, I could be like Groundhog Day man and do whate
ver I want. I could have knowledge and be famous and rich. I could be a millionaire. They prevent stuff like that happening. I always thought I was lucky or it was genetics or big bounce theory with anomalies, but I don’t know. Some things aren’t worth thinking about anymore. I often felt like I lived too many past lives numbered in the trillions. Like my mind was transferred millions or even an infinite amount of times."
176009601,_AT_MENTION_ thank you… I hope to sale some someday
174344126,There’s pharmaceutical stuff you can get as well. Talk to your doctor. I’m not sure I’d recommend benzos though as they’re only for short term use.
176009602,"As for medicines and all substances in general, have you ever wondered why each of us has so many different positive and side effects?"
176009603,"You’re not a bad person, you’re not going to hell, and you won’t die soon. I’ve been through all of those thoughts when the voices used to tell me those things. However even if they fail to convince you of those things they can still be a horrible nuisance because they are always with you and constantly insulting you at times. What helps me a lot is talking with a friend or family member for awhile. My voices tend to go quiet for awhile when I do that. Also listening to soothing sounds on a youtube video of waterfalls or celestial white noise can help. Other than that I’m not sure what to suggest, those are the things that work best for me."

176009612,"Big question, sleepoptimistic. My opinion is that the truth is relative to the wider context. With most things - that context comprises of environmental inputs and your own stack of beliefs/experiences. You can validate if something is factual by using the scientific method. Devising a range of experiments to validate a hypothesis (the thing that you think is true). And then carrying them out. Or if you don’t trust your own perception (or others don’t), you could get 3 random people who don’t know each other to do your experiments and give you the results. If they all match - then you’ve validated it as true."

My mother and my social worker made draconian efforts to help me and they made me feel better. Several friends are helping me. My doctor started me on low dose Wellbutrin.

176009630,Florida is going to regret not canceling Spring Break just like Louisiana didn’t cancel Mardis Gras.
176009631,From exercise? Antipsychotics make us less tolerate heat and too hot or too cold is bad for the body. I know my Latuda came with a paper saying that it causes heat intolerance.
174344133,"Since I switched to Abilify last May, I no longer have the desire to drink. I used to drink when I was feeling down, but I guess I no longer feel down. My anxiety is gone, and I no longer have to take Klonopin. Do you think an AP could cause you to want or not want to drink?"
176009632,Maybe take Depakote at night before bed Or thin the doses.
176009633,"I just turned 61 in May. Next year when I turn 62, I’ll be able to move into a seniors only apartment building. I’m looking forward to it."

176009635,I’m pretty sure they only do direct deposit into your account they stopped sending checks years ago. If you’re approved and give them account info the money goes in pretty fast. If you get back pay I advise you to save it not get too excited and blow it.
176009636,aha…I thought I read something about you losing your pdoc. What happened? Are you going to look for another?

176009640,I have epilepsy.
176009641,I don’t think they can read minds.
176009642,I got sucked in with banana bread. Oh well. As long as I only eat my planned dinner and nothing else today I’ll still be within my calorie goals. I’ll be happy when the temptation of that banana bread is gone.
174344137,"I had concentration and math tests last week in therapy, I did pretty well, in the average just like normies. Before sz my cognition was better though, I had better grades in school."
174344135,Upload was simple; still learning how to copy/paste/embed etc.
176009643,"I think you are not wrong, but I suppose I just believe that one has a certain responsibility for the “whole” over the “individual.” If you are truly happy riding the high of psychosis all the time that’s all well and good, but don’t you ever long to try to understand & empathize with other experiences that perhaps aren’t so “heady”? In other words, don’t you ever long to connect with others in the “finite” realm? For myself, it is impossible when I am feeling that “infinite” feeling you describe. Furthermore, not to put you down, but your posts are difficult to follow. I don’t know, for myself (again), I find it very frustrating when I can’t articulate my thoughts & feelings correctly. I also feel a sort of obligation to try to make them as clear for others as I can. Otherwise I feel my words & intentions become cheap at best and meaningless at worst. Anyway, these are just my thoughts. I am not one to label you as “sick” or not…but I remain curious about your 
outlook. Perhaps purely from a philosophical point of view. Feel free to respond or not. Seems the catharsis of getting your view out is doing something for you."
176009644,I’ve felt like this too. Eventually things turned around. Wishing for the best for you and everyone else here who’s struggling.
176009645,"Sounds like the 6 years I spent in my office job. Looking back I don’t think it was healthy to do this. Hoping that my Landscaping venture will remain a positive thing. At least if I crash, I have no obligation to anyone and I am in charge of my own destiny - as long as people want to hire me for my services that is… _USER_ID_. If it doesn’t work out, I will try and get a job more locally. I don’t care so much about money these days, which is good. Before I felt trapped by my sense of duty first, and second by how much I was getting paid and the security of income. Seems to have been a false thing to believe so far… We’ll see what happens."
176009646,And you always had it since then?
176009647,Both are bizzare. You need to see a doctor.
176009648,"It seems to be the mood of the police here that any time there is a dust up both parties go to jail, no questions asked. You might have to deal with something like that. Try to explain to your brother that you need your coffee, and assertively claim access to the outlet for the time it takes you to brew your coffee. You might think about getting noise canceling head phones."
176009649,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176009650,"Sounds horrible. When i was at a hospital last time, i was constantly walking around, but it was not akathisia then, it was the surroundings. It was a scary place, closed unit. The other patients were walking just like me, for no purpose. Once a patient stopped me and said: “It’s like the animals in the ZOO, just without spectators.”. Then we laughed and were friends for the rest of the stay."
176009651,How the ???? do I log out?
176009652,Hi how has the running been going if you’ve been doing it? Do you still feel tired when running after going on the zyprexia? _AT_MENTION_
174344139,Why do I get a rush of energy when taking my meds late? Is it a dopamine rush? Yesterday took Risperdal at 9:30pm and today at 11:30pm. Its like if my negative symptoms begin to disappear but I know that I will have positive symptoms the next day… My pharmacist said to take it at the same time everyday… Do you take your meds at the same time everyday?
176009653,I never interact with mine now. Not real and not worth my attention.
176009654,"_AT_MENTION_ I think your selling yourself short but I can relate. I often have come unstuck in social situations. It never stopped me from trying even though I’ve had some deal breaking failures. I guess I’m a positive person but that hurt is real. In the past I’ve always said it was my fault. I was too shy, too lonely too this or that. When sz came in it became something I’ve come to terms with. I just did what I could to survive with a broken brain! I live ok with my past nowadays. I wouldn’t change it even if I could because I’m happy with myself right now! That is important. Be happy with yourself now!"
176009655,"Up until the Amyloban I always had the psychotic symptoms, but they would gradually become worse and I’d cross the line where I lost my insight without realizing it. Usually 3 to 6 months until a relapse once off meds. The last one was very bad and I’m never messing with my meds again – they will be taken as directed by the doctor."
174344141,OCD is linked to both serotonin and dopamine deficiency. If clozapine is inducing OCD then its due to dopamine deficiency. Other symptom you can experience with this kind of OCD is working memory issue. Forgetting quickly or hard to keep several information in mind at once.
176009656,I have also wondered how a disease can not only talk to you but also do so intelligently. I find it’s best not to think about it. People speak to you in dreams right? Same basic principle I think.
174344138,I’m not having any of those symptoms on Abilify. Just that my thoughts processes are on the slow side and sleep problems.
176009657,A man wanted to find out What the sexual fantasies of his wife were about So he left a fake survey And made it look like it was from her favorite online magazine And hid while she filled it out Pretty soon his face would fall out She worked on it night and day But he read it anyway I want to tell you he’s now stable and doing fine At a Psych Hospital on the county line He now takes 20 prescriptions Full of things I can’t mention There’s things a man does not need to know And don’t forget I told you so
176009658,Thank you! I am going to talk to my doctor soon. But I used to really love music more than anybody I know and I sounded amazing. Do you think that’s part of the illness? Maybe too much dopamine in my head?
176009659,No. That’s a Bizzare way to get kids to bed early.
176009660,Good morning from Finland
176009661,"thank you, i’m very cozy here"
176009662,Once i forgot the passwords and god knows how i managed to retrieve them. The security for passwords is very high.
176009663,The haldol is causing very bad akathisia for me. I think I’ll need to talk to him about adjustments.
176009664,"After 30 hours in psychiatric hospital, closed intensive care unit. I begged them to release me cause im going to work tomorrow. They actually listened to me this time and didn’t sedate me. And now ready and fresh again but a bit confused."
176009665,That’s interesting that it comes in cycles. Are you SZA or mildly bipolar?
176009666,"I think what you’re referring to might be called “von neumann probes” but this doesn’t seem to be happening right now, but maybe it is happening by a biological way like DNA or something, I don’t know."
176009667,"np i never seen this, duo with post malone cool"
176009668,My parents say that dying sane is better than dying insane. I don’t understand.
176009669,recommend a diet or pills which you used and dropped more than 8 kg
176009670,I just think someone’s after me has been for 6 weeks now. I don’t even want to eat again I went weeks barely eating over this because someone’s poisoning my food. I woke up a few days ago thinking I’m dead I’m dead now nothing feels real everyones a Simulation. Talking to anyone feels fake. It’s all in my head .
176009671,"Just let the proffessor know, that your stressed and having a ruff time with a personnal problem. I am sure he or she will understand."
176009672,It doesn’t work 100% YET. You need to give it time. Time. Not seconds.
176009673,I didnt recommend it and speak for yourself. It help me
176009674,"I think it’s more body damage with ap’s then brain… Diabetes,hyperlypidemia,high prolactin levels etc"
176009675,I’ve played beat saber and it was pretty fun.
176009676,True… but I’m not under those kinds of feelings… there is no fluttering going on. Trying to keep it wise. Just be fair in my reasoning and give her all the time in the world too just reveal herself. but even that is giving it too much focus… “If you want to know somebody… you might take a quick look at… their best friends” -Lyrics from a strokes song. The same bars… even like the same bartenders… but I’m not looking to ride any assumptions. The truth always reveals itself in the end. Just wait for the truth… plain as day.
176009677,That’s awesome! So cool when kids start taking responsibility
176009678,"I’m just saying, I Could have These side - effects Because both Valproate And, risperdal Causes them . . I Don’t need your opinion, I Have science . ."
176009679,Mate. You’ve got to put yourself out there if your going to find that special person. So this one didn’t work. Might be the next one is the lady of your dreams… Keep trying to meet people as it’s a game of numbers. More people you meet the better your chances of finding someone compatible. Sorry this one seems bust!
176009680,How old are you _AT_MENTION_? I’m 56
176009681,"We also don’t allow people to say atheism is correct. It’s just another belief system, when you get down to it."
176009682,yes but they aren’t selling it.
176009683,Glad you’re feeling a bit better. If these glitches happen often then maybe you talk to your psychiatrist about increasing your dose maybe?
176009684,Did you hear that _AT_MENTION_? She’s feeling good.
176009685,I was going to say _AT_MENTION_
176009686,_AT_MENTION_ - Benzos used to help me sleep also. I stopped taking them and had horrible withdrawal symptoms. Im scared of taking them now.
176009687,So here in South Africa _USER_ID_ means like yea its good A _USER_ID_ boerie roll
176009688,“why do you ask for their help? Die die”
176009689,It brings out the worst in me according to others when people say certain things which according to them is trivial and they think I am acting weird. According to me I am fighting for care and trust. I do not know what to accept according to them or according to me. Mind you I just use words.
174344146,"I have a different theory for this. According to this theory your voices or your schizophrenia took control of your body and did things that you wouldn’t do, and then planted a fake memory in your mind which makes you remember things differently from how they really happened. Apparently schizophrenia can take control over the body, and it can produce fake memories, so that would be one theory to explain what really happened."
176009690,I guess you will never change your mind unless you have another episode… I hope you the best.
176009691,hey there _AT_MENTION_-Cotton if you think your meds are not doing the trick yet then you could ask to increase them yea but you should talk about it with your pdoc really.
174344145,"Do any of y’all suffer amnesia along with your Schizophrenia? I do, and I’m scared I will one day walk away from it all and not remember anything. It already happened once. I wasn’t on meds and I was found wondering the woods. I could have fallen victim or just died of exposure. I’m just worried it’ll happen again."
176009692,"Its the result of cause and effect. Either the individual or some one in family abused with drugs, illegal substances including tobacco, cocaine or some other. This way genetic mutations occurred which then passed in the herditary line. Some lucky and get away from it while they can still pass it to next generations."
176009693,"Keeping up with the healthy habits and enjoying the good times don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Keep up with the meditation, even when things are going well it will help you get through hiccups and stressors that could otherwise they’re you back down to a worse place. Keep up with the healthy eating, but don’t be so strict all the time if it’s causing you problems. If you want to enjoy a treat, do so in moderation. Then get right back to the healthier eating. Don’t fall into the trap of oh, I had a huge fast food lunch so I might as well go all in and eat a whole pizza for dinner and this soda and this bag of chips and cookies. Moderation."
176009694,"I get most of those to some manageable extent, except for the repetitive movements and self-harm, (not anymore, anyways.) My speech is fine though. I had a 10 year period of slow self-harm when I tried to become a pro gamer for 7-10 hours a day while totally neglecting my joint health. IDK what I was expecting, but my elbows gave out."
176009695,Do you have a roommate or your own room?
176009696,"_AT_MENTION_ , I will ask him. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I’m just waking up not ready to face these people. But I’m going to go have my coffeee He got me when I fell asleep on the couch. Maybe he felt guilty"
176009697,"My dad died with complications due to liver failure i really wish he could have stopped i still dont know if he was telling us the truth about why he needed the drink my friend recently fell off the wagon after 22mths but he said it wasnt what he thought it would be and luckily he’s was smart enough to tell his support team and started taking the antabuse, the antabuse keeps him off it bc it would make him violently sick or worse if he drank alcohol on it."
176009698,What works for me when I’m in panic mode is some light floor stretching with some relaxing deep breathing techniques or some slow love music on While doing a lyrical style dance routine. (Only if I’m alone! ) lol!
176009699,"It sounds like paranoia, they don’t hire people to troll patients in the wards, they are also sick."
176009700,Geodon is usually weight neutral. Did you gain weight on it? You are doing better than I would. I would have been hospitalized in November. Best of luck.
176009701,I want to collect my pictures and burn them I am a piece of ???? and no one loves me. Absolutely no one. I deserve to burn in agony. I deserve pain. I HATE HATE HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I didn’t accomplish anything. I am just a piece of ???? who doesn’t study and all I do is take out my parents’ money. All I do is burden them. Other people are studying and doing everything they can to please their parents but NOT me. I am SICK ALL THE TIME. ALL THE TIME!!! I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU ARE ????_USER_ID_? I HATE YOU!!! I HATE YOU HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE YOU!!! YOU ARE FULL OF ???? I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU
176009702,I think tukey is one and has worked as one. Not sure if she’s been around for a while.
176009703,I hate taking meds because my voices very meanly tell me to take my meds. They are so mean about everything that I hate respecting them by taking meds.
176009704,I hope it continues to get better _AT_MENTION_ Depression sucks.
176009705,"I don’t have any positive symptoms anymore, just negatives, but I generally feel worse in the morning or whenever I wake up(my sleep schedule is not very stable)."
176009706,Every morning I wake up surprised because every night I feel like I’m going to get killed.
174344154,"I hear you. But your life is valuable and you are not lost, as you say you have. I have a physical disability that is genetic and degenerative. Depending on how fast my progression is, my muscles will disappear one by one and it will eventually kill off my breathing muscles, making me dependent on ventilators at night or even during the day. You may say that this is worse than schizophrenia, but it’s actually not. You may say that I have “lost” my life to muscular dystrophy. But I haven’t lost anything, and my life is just like any other suffering that people bear daily. We have a lot of _USER_ID_ attached and it can be very heavy. We have lost our futures and the ability to work (for some of us) to psychosis. However, that doesn’t mean that we’re invaluable and unworthy. The society’s perception of disability is very negative. They measure us on the basis of how we can function in the capitalist society. However, life is so much more than that. Life is not about whether we can work o
r not. Life is about what we value, what we love, and what we cherish. Not about what we can’t do. We may have “lost” some of our abilities to psychosis, but that doesn’t mean that we aren’t worth anything. We have value and we exist for a good reason. I wish I can tell myself this and I don’t believe it resonates with me, but I hope it resonates with you."
176009707,"I actually use myfitnesspal. Now that I’m in my 3rd day of calorie deficit I actually feel pretty good, not too hungry. _PERSON_ was recommended for losing 2 pounds a week"
176009708,This topic was automatically closed 7 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.
176009709,"I’ve always had some unusual beliefs and some paranoia, but I wasn’t diagnosed until 25ish."
176009710,"I did that, i accepted that it doesnt have to be this way, i found a 'way out’ i guess, either that or it was the meds, i like to think that i had some influence in my recovery and its not all just med related meds are not thoughts although they can numb your brain enough to prevent you from having thoughts if they are deemed to be bad."
176009711,Its difficult to prove you have a disability when someone cannot see it. It is impossible for someone who sits an hour talking to you to see it.
174344160,"I gained probably 60lbs on Seroquel, I was just ravenously hungry all the time. That’s when I decided to quit APs. I lost the weight but I was super crazy. Now I’m on Abilify and have only gained about 15lbs in three years, Mostly because of my own poor dietary choices. I need to lose that, but I fear the AP will make it more difficult. I’m in the process of dieting and exercising now."
174344157,"I wouldnt say that’s completely fair. One of the biggest problems with this illness is paranoid delusions. There are people who are convinced that their meds are poison among other things. I get what you’re saying, but it’s not always as easy as choosing to take your meds or not. I’m not saying I’m anti medicine, on the contrary I’m 100% for medicine, I’m just saying it’s not so black and white as to why one may not want to take their meds. Lack of insight is one of the worst parts about schizophrenia."
176009712,Something you injest*
176009713,How long have u taken it?
176009714,"Yes. People were more practial creative back then. No mobile or computer, but still the world managed to keep itself occupied."
176009715,"It would be an adjustment, that’s for sure. I’d rather work to overcome my fear."
176009716,"A former coworker seemed able to see when I stopped meds. Dont know how, might been the eyes."
176009717,My depression meds were OK but the SZ meds had side effects that made me feel really uncomfortable. Very similar to the feeling that comes from withdrawals from opiates.
176009718,i have no motivation and executive problems.
174344161,Didn’t you say that you switched to Latuda? You also wanted to try Abilify.
174344164,I read that some antipsychotics in high doses can cause heart problems.
176009719,Yes it is excellent if it is used the right way and It is very potent
176009720,"The Phosphatidylserine I got was from _PERSON_’s website, I think it was the cheapest there."
176009721,I don’t remember anyone having their caregiver with them here. one person had his little sister (college age or so) and he seemed to like to have her here.
176009722,"Malaise, nausea, couldn’t get up from bed, headache, insomnia."

176009724,Thanks _PERSON_ To me personally I was trying to convey a feeling of despair.
176009725,Yes they are serious. That’s why I crack up into insane laughter.
176009726,My former doctor was an idiot
176009727,DO we need need to have hope any more?
174344165,"Maybe you should just lower your dose instead of stopping them all together. I know someone from this website who was doing so well on abilify for many years so he decided to stop. Few months after, he was having relapse. He tried to go back on abilify but it never work again. He had to spend the next three years to find the right med again. What was the reason that you want to stop med?"
176009728,Horrible drug. Didn’t make me sleep. Made me hungry and got out of bed to go eat.and totally killed my libido. I am sure it works for some people though.
176009729,Are the voices the only symptoms you get?
176009730,Thanks:)))))))))
176009731,Hugs! I think you are a kind person and not unsupportive…
176009732,"I had 3 sausage links this morning along with fried banana, slices, a cup of coffee, a container of yogurt. Too bad I was out of bacon."
176009733,"Well past my teens. No offense meant at all, but I’m still in “guarded mode.” Perhaps sometime sooner or later I will reveal some more personal stuff. Let’s say I’m between 20 and 50. Not trying to be superfluous, just private. I hope you under stand."
176009734,I sleep with a light on in the hallway. I get scared if it’s pitch black.
176009735,So got some post holidays blow back and put on 1kg! Not impressed but you get that on the big jobs. Been a bit of weather round here so missed a lot of cardio. This week it’s back to the grindstone and a bit more seriousness about my diet. New goal is back under 100 then 98. I reckon that is reasonable in a couple of weeks!
176009736,I have an interest in fitness. I wan’t to share my strategies.
176009737,I know someone who does this and has some laser machine in her garage where she burns or marks wood/metal etc and creates personalised items for people
176009738,Glad you experienced that. I get little moments like that with my family too. I forget them too easily though
176009739,Just by your presence. So that they know they’re not alone in their suffering.
176009740,My doctor refuse to give me anti anxiety tablets For anxiety I do lots of walking and lots relaxation
176009741,Haloperidol is poison! Don’t take it! I strongly reccomend not to take it!
176009742,"Mine is worse in my left hand, too. It’s weird because you’d think it would be worse in my dominant hand. The plus side to that is that it’s not as difficult to hold things as it would be if it were my dominant hand."
176009743,Can you buy flour and yeast and sugar. Homemade bread isn’t difficult to make plus a bag of flour can make several loaves of bread
176009744,"I wanted to share some things positive… A lady from church contacted me. She was near and asked to do grocery shopping since im in home isolation because of a cough etc. A neighbourhood initiative with volunteers put a paper in every mailbox saying we are in this together, to call if you need help, need contact or want to offer help. My church and several other churches run initiatives to look after old, isolated, lonely people. People i know offered to volunteer in hospitals. Many beautiful initiatives! It makes me a little bit less scared to see this happening!"
176009745,I’m sorry your illness is worsening. I can’t imagine how difficult that must be for you.
176009746,I’ve given up piggy food until the end of April. The topic got shut but I didn’t mean to bring that to the discussion. Me and my partner are just giving up piggy food until April. I hope I can lose weight.
176009747,"_PERSON_ they sometimes make you fight a long fight, but it’s still worth it. I’m glad you got it"
176009748,You should tell her that she needs to stop saying that.
176009749,"Yes, they learned they were wrong. But my parents were proud people. Admitting they were wrong was difficult for them."
176009750,"To be fair, Weight Watchers isn’t exactly calorie counting. Foods are assigned a certain number of points based on their nutritional value, and you get a certain allotment of points each day. Foods like skinless chicken breast, eggs, beans, fruits, and veggies are all 0 points, so hypothetically you could eat as much of those as you want."
176009751,What language is that _AT_MENTION_ ? I hope you meet someone nice
176009752,Good luck.it look like good drug so far
176009753,Antidepressants can worsen this.

176009755,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ What do you guys think
176009756,This is awful. I feel terrible for those of you who rely on this med. I hope y’all can find something that works well for you in lieu of Haldol.
176009757,Is body fat food to the brain? I know the snake diet explains it well
176009758,I know how that feels. I was really paranoid a couple days ago. It’s the worst feeling.
176009759,So talented _AT_MENTION_! Beautiful artwork!

176009798,"The first time I was given Haldol I was also on Thorazine, Mellaril & Effexor. I was 14-15 years old and hospitalized in Milledgeville Central State Hospital. I was a walking zombie. Next several times I was given it in shot form and then by pill. I experienced whole body restlessness to the point I couldn’t sit or stand or do anything without feeling like I was going to come out of my own skin. I also experienced tightening of my neck muscles. I just recently (a month ago) took it again very briefly and same symptoms returned reminding me it was indeed the Haldol and no other medications that caused those side effects. I think it is key to remember though that every person reacts differently to certain medications. Trial and error."

176009800,"I voted “schizophrenic co-creator of universe”. It seems I relate. I escaped the sim before (very distant past life) and interacted with people. Maybe even created some things. It was real and aliens were involved and I may have been an alien myself or avatar/android. It wasn’t worth it. _PERSON_ is curious what it’s like, but I rather have his life: the money, influence, and women, and especially his genius and SANITY! I have memories of my step-father, me, and my brother working on simulation theory. I get dreams of it, especially with my step-father. I thought at one time, due to the aliens, that he was a Draco Reptilian, the most powerful of the reptilian-alien hybrids, which is a conspiracy and sort of insult now a days. I was just an Anunnaki, which is different I guess and less powerful than the Dracos which are like the head of the aliens. They picked me for a reason. I know why but it’s no point in repeating myself. I probably was under duress and alien mind control, but at the e
nd of the day, I had some power and was cured of insanity/schizophrenia for some time. I realized this world isn’t real and that it’s essentially a brain in a vat.

And I wanted to go to a sports school after I got deferred from UConn in my home state. I transferred back to _NAME_ college In NY after first semester and that place was brutal for any Sz. Let alone I was treated as a minority demographic at that school (Jewish last name, I stood out in a lot of ways, got a lot of abuse for it all). I was One of the only persons at that school who tried to think for themselves and I got heat for it. Now I would like to go to community college. I should’ve gone to cc from the start but in my hs if you didn’t go to a 4 year back then, you were considered a failure.

176009842,You don’t take an antipsychotic?
176009843,A lot of people are ignorant of what mental illness actually is. I’ve had friends and family doubt that I have an illness. It wasn’t because they knew more than the doctors - it was because they knew next to nothing about it. I think you should ask yourself - “who has more credentials on this subject”? And chances are it will be the ones getting paid to assist vulnerable people live their lives and who has studied seven years plus to do so.
176009844,"I’m sorry honey, that’s terrible"
174344191,I really hate those guys. Instead of working on newer better antipsychotics what they do is talking and talking about MIRACLE effects of the same existing sh** delivered differently. The real message is WE NEED TO CONTROL those with schizophrenia.

This was after he kept on saying I have sza. So why did he write F32 and not F35? Didn’t I ever have psychosis then? Do I even belong on here? Is my unusual beliefs like Alien and _NAME_ spirits in my head and my mother in law trying to poison me - are they real then? And what about my voices? If they’re not psychosis then what are they? Anxiety? I’m so scared. What of I’m a fake after all? Am I really in need of my meds if I’m not psychotic? Why did they give me AP’S over the years if I’m not psychotic? I’m so confused! I realised something else - if they thought I have depression then why didn’t they give me antidepressant meds? Instead they gave me AP’S and mood stabilisers It sounds crazy - they state I had depression and anxiety - yet they treat me with completely different meds. And they say I have sza but then write somethi

Fighting the craving. I don’t like even being around alcohol or people drinking anymore. I used to be bad. Shitfaced at parties. Would wake up in the middle of the night with shakes, take a couple shots and go back to bed. It was every day, passing out every night. I was a danger to myself and others. It’s been about two and a half years since I’ve drank. I can honestly say my life is better way from it, but that doesn’t stop the urge. My mind will romanticize it, try to _USER_ID_ rationing, wave it off. Typing has helped. My heart goes out to anyone struggling."

176009882,"yea I know what you mean. for example, he would repeat things if he doesn’t think I catch on. He sees it in my perspective too, and is always trying to make it easy for me in social situations. I was at a poetry reading with him at a coffee shop a month or two ago and I couldn’t focus because of all the stimulation, so he reached out and grabbed my hand - instant anxiety reducer and I was able to focus on one person and not look everywhere as if I was disinterested even though I wasn’t I was just trying to focus, and to do that, I look away. I really depend on him to be symptom free which I don’t think is healthy?"

I think his dad may have had issues too. Maybe alcohol. I never asked. I didn’t want to embarrass him. when my dad’s mom died everyone came to the funeral there was a church sermon. She was very loved. When my grandpa died my dad was alone to set up the funeral and only a few people came. It was kind of painful for me.

174344215,"I don’t know if weed causes it or not. I never smoked until I was about nineteen. That was after I had schizophrenia and psychosis. Weed really just got me out of my shell but overall not that much it could do for me anymore. It tends to reduce inhibitions, making people more gullible and dysphoric. Recently I tried CBD and some mild THC drops from the store. That actually made me super super sick. I didn’t think herbal CBD would have that effect. So IMO weed doesn’t really help at all; just the general effects are not medicinal for schizophrenia, can cause paranoia and disconnections from ourselves. I thought maybe it was the type of weed-often it is worse with certain types, but now I refuse to smoke weed or anything anymore. I threw the rest away and I stopped using THC drops they made me unbearably sick last week. I became instantly delusional and was very embarassing."

I wouldn’t look after his basic needs like feeding him properly or bathing. I was irritable all the time with him and had no bond, no feeling of being a mother. I was in an elevated state but neglecting needs at the same time. I was paranoid too.

176010063,"My family bought my sister and I condos she still lives there and I moved out and we sold mine. I lived there about 8 months and did damage to the wall and a door besides what my cat did. I lived alone in a two bedroom and was either drinking alot or going stark crazy. I didn’t see my family much during this time. I can’t believe how much my family has paid for me. I might as well of got my PHD like my brother did but I never did college. They’ve paid for theuraputic communities which cost an arm and a leg and didn’t really help. The only thing that helped I hate to say is my recent year long stay in the state hospital. It was miserable even though I had a job I enjoyed working with plants. Just getting back on the medication and the time staying stable has had me recover very nicely. My first apartment was when I was 20 if you don’t count dissociative episodes where I rented a house with a few girls. I moved north to a nice city with a female friend of mine. We ended up hanging out with 
high school kids and drinking alot. I remember watching a ton of _PERSON_ sketch comedy at night. I applied for a job in a factory but freaked out when they asked me to take a drug test when I could have just told them that I’d smoked recently at a party but wasn’t into it or anything. This was before my diagnosis of _PERSON_. Then it was communal living at this therapeutic community farm. I went out with three women then after a long time of being single. Worked in the community garden, worked with pigs and cows and learned to weld which was awesome. I was sober for most of this. Then it was an inpatient/outpatient program for people with mental health disorders and addiction. I played drums in a band for a while. We used to jam at the music shack with other musicians at the therapeutic farm too. I got into smoking spice and even crack cocaine because I was around people who had these drug addictions. I didn’t really have an addiction to street drugs I was just using adderall wrong and drinking alcohol
. They had these people called mentors who would drive you around to go shopping, take you to AA meetings or just to hang out somewhere. It was okay I guess but it was depressing as I stayed single again for a long time as it was an all male program and I didn’t really go out of my way to meet people outside the program. I should have joined a dating site then I wish I had. I had two apartments during this time. My first place got bedbugs and there was a murder/shooting outside the apartment so I moved to a nicer neighborhood. I joined clubhouse international during this time and got elected to go as a representative to the international conference in St. _NAME_. I got really into this clubhouse thing for people with mental illness it’s like a drop in center. I had a six month seat on the board of directers it was awesome. My mother got into it and ended up founding a clubhouse in my hometown that’s still going, it’s still really small. I used to go there. I liked sitting outside and smoking cigarette
s with the members and staff. I lost my motivation for the work of the clubhouse though. I was living on my own in my condo at this point. I would just go for the socialization. I wish I hadn’t had my family sell the place. It was a two bedroom in an apartment complex. Most of it was rentals but there were 24 owned units one of which was mine. I’d be on my own rather than living with family if I hadn’t done this. Long post sorry."

176010131,"Schizophrenia hit me hard too, in the first month of my symptoms i was violent against friends, then everything fell apart people stop calling me, that was back then because nobody knew what it was, when i got diagnose Schiz, some people went to school to a degree where they understood for the first time what schizophrenia is, and now some work at the hospital, nursing in psych ward or anything related to it. Its good career. But as for me, i am way behind in any career, in fact i have no career but still happy that i can go out, for me happiness is freedom."
176010132,I have mixed feelings about my dad… I love him and he’s really great in some respects. But he also did a lot of abusive ???? when I was growing up.
174344268,I’m remembering the time I was so depressed and hearing voices and dissociating badly and I had to walk to the pharmacy to pick up my Latuda by myself. I got so angry when I got there I went into the bathroom at the pharmacy and took the whole bottle. I walked home and crawled into bed and fell asleep to never wake up again. At some point later my husband at the time found the empty bottle in the bag and called 911. They came and called the police and forced me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they threatened to pump my stomach if I didn’t take charcoal. So I did. My heart began to slow down and they kept giving me medicine to keep it beating but I was getting sicker. The hospital didn’t have an ICU so they decided to fly me to the closest cardiac ICU. I stayed in the ICU for 3 days while they kept my heart beating. Then they transferred me to a regular hospital bed where I saw a Psychiatrist and her team. By this time I was no longer a danger to myself and they arranged for my mental he
alth team to come get me and bring me home. My pdoc took me off Latuda and put me on Saphris. Since then I’ve been much more stable and once we added Rexulti I don’t think about suicide like I used to. Thanks for listening.

176010134,"I’ve struggled with this for 7 years or so now, at first it was so real. But looking back I see errors in the psychosis that help me retain insight. Best of luck, I don’t envy anyone that has to deal with thought broadcasting/mind reading… It has certainly ruined my life."
176010135,You recovered with meds or without? Your symptoms got better while you are on the same dosage of meds?
176010136,That’s good. Today I’m feeling much better. I was panicking for 2 days and now feel my symptoms are in remission.
176010137,2006 Ages…
176010138,Why do you think that?
174344266,It’s already 9 months ago. Update: I take 250mg haldol injection
176010139,"I spill my guts. I did nothing for a few days and stopped taking 3mg creatine, it takes me days to recover from deadlifting. I deadlifted heavy on either monday tuesday or wednesday. sets reps: 5 total sets/ between 12-15 reps 105x12 conventional for quads 125x15 conv 4 quads 160x8 conv for quads 160x8 (failed) romanian for glutes/hams, grip + spinal erectors failing, near rounding out with good breathing 195x3-4 (failing) romanian for posterior chain, rounding out, slight drop on last 2 reps I never used the lower setting, so it was hard, even though I’ve gone at least a week without doing it. I elevate my legs lying down by the couch afterward, above my heart to drain waste materials from the lymphatic system, reducing soreness and speeding recovery. Still, I lay in the dark a day or two afterward and try to get good sleep. It helps my cns recover. i did some pull ups later on, 3-4 reps (3-5) seconds and that was it. neat! i watch strength camp with _NAME_ hulse. deadlifting wrecks me emotional
ly. i don’t have plates which are nearly heavy enough, rather they weigh 210 at the most, for romanian deadlift on low handles thats more than enough. i did 190lbs on the last set, i felt like i was falling apart, even with the creatine. laying in bed in the dark is good too. still, it makes me feel cold in my chest to my inner thighs and slightly like crying for a day and a half. like my bones are petrified. everythings soft and puffy now and i lost 3 pounds. i stopped taking the stuff, so its a matter of water balance. im not lifting and benefitting. i eat meat and im not drinking a lot of water, i drink a lot of milk. i jumped off a stair to do a depth jump and my sesamoiditis started acting up. i have to stay off them for a while. with the mood stabilizers, the inflammation, or other bone injuries are unlikely to heal. i wanna hex bar pendlay row next week. i bought basketball shoes on amazon. i watched a video on youtube, and i started figuring out my stroke. And so you have to sort of fling it. i wann
a jump up and down because then its helps you maintain bone density. if it does, that’s a signal that im getting more coordinated. and thats a good thing to be able to gauge how the anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are impacting me as I get accustomed to them."
176010140,"yeah im like you i read stuff here.im forgetting stuff,no wonder i dont have a life to talk about."
176010141,"There’s a difference between paranoia and a paranoid delusion, because unfortunately, there are some things that you should be paranoid about. Trigger happy policemen, sexist doctors, racist judges; these are some very real, very serious issues that we need to be wary of. That said, it shouldn’t be all consuming. Just make sure you practice basic safety tactics. Don’t talk to the police without a lawyer. Don’t let the police search anything unless they have a warrant. NEVER call the police to your home. Make sure the officers can see your hands at all times. Do not TOUCH anything that they give you, including food or drink. Do not use any bathrooms in a police station unless you’re in a cell and it’s a true emergency. Do not resist arrest, even if it’s unlawful. Stuff like that. I got the lowdown from my mom yesterday because I haven’t been watching the news. Honestly though, all of this stuff can be boiled down into one simple rule: Don’t be a goddamn idiot. Schizo special: If yo
u notice that you’re destabilizing, try your absolute hardest to get yourself to a hospital or a loved one before you lose insight."
176010142,"I understand… I fought with normal ways to relate to men. You have to make a switch in your head somehow. Especially if you get hurt by it. I think casual sex damages me emotionally, especially if i am in love, but always really. So i stopped it."

Risk history - delusions ,self harm/suicidal ideation/poor impulse control/non compliance."
174344279,I’ve decided to never quite meds but make sure I am on the lowest dose and the meds with least side effects. Goal is to not notice I am on meds.

176010154,"Oh thought I would add, the only thing that seems to help with these “thought traps” I get sucked into of everything being broken down into 1000 tiny steps I get overwhelmed by is by forcing myself to do it every day until it becomes routine. It is SO hard to do and I am usually not successful but after about 1-2 weeks of doing whatever it is EVERY DAY it becomes habit and my anxiety around it and thought about it becomes significantly less. So interestingly routine seems to streamline things. Unfortunately typically as any stressor in my life pops up I tend to abandon routine, stop doing all the things I worked so hard to make a part of it, and then I have to start over from stage 1 all over again."

176010170,"I get a thought stuck in my mind and act on it accordingly, repeatedly for a period of time until that thing is no longer bothering me. It could be a day, or a week or months to years. Once I got it in my mind that a spider would go in my cup of coffee and I spent the next 6 months freaking out about drinking my coffee to the point that a special cup had to be bought for me (one with a lid). We have lights that have multiple switches, the correct switch had to be down in order for me to sleep, that went on for years, and I had to check it multiple times after anyone was up. My under garments had to match. I had to get ready in the same order. At work I had to do my job in the same order. My possessions had to be in order. My canned food was alphabetized. In general most things have an order."

176010210,Mediums are con artists. Always have been. Schizophrenics probably some mystics and stuff but unsure whether they’d survive some cultures. Difference is often the point of whether you live or not in most old western cultures and even the East. Seriously. I had a paternal grandmother who read tea leaves. She did it professionally when needing money and had a lot to do with her. She was great at reading people and telling them what they wanted to hear. It’s not rocket science and a skilled con will read your reactions to basic questions and move from there.

176010248,"I had a pickup truck and I used to go every week to government GSA (General Services Administration) furniture auctions. They were fixed price and bookshelves were all identical and 20 dollars, I took them home and shined them up and sold them on Craigslist for 200 dollars apiece. I also collected pieces of what are called Barrister Bookshelves. They are made of interchangeable, stackable shelves with glass doors on each one. They have a base, a top, and as many shelves as you stack in between. Got a good profit on those as well, even had one I used personally assembled from good parts over a year for about 100 dollars, sold it for 900 when I needed the money and didn’t have the means to take it with me when I moved. I crashed my truck during onset and the auctions have since been permanently ended. I’m not sure what the reason for ending the auctions was, I never asked. I was on disability before onset though, for my Bipolar, so I was working on disability. I could handle the same job again to
day if I had a truck and knew of another great place to buy furniture, I’ve recovered a lot and can drive alright again."

176010252,Congrats on the BSc in ComSci. Honesty is the best policy IMHO. If they understand that you might need to reduce your hours in the future then you can negotiate. It all depends on how bad your sz is. If you studied full time you might be able to handle full time work in which case go for it. NZ seems like a progressive and forgiving place (I live in Aus). Good luck.

So starting tomorrow Friday I plan to wake up at 6:30am to go for a run. I want to do at least a mile. I haven’t ran since my last marathon which was in February. I have regained energy plus less pain with my osteoporosis. Throughout the day I will be doing yoga/Pilates. But after my run I will do 30 minutes of boxing training which I miss the most. I ask from my friends on here to hold me accountable to do all this to not just lose weight but to also feel good physically and mentally. I will check in on this thread daily about my workouts and how things are going. Please feel free to ask questions or even tell me about your workout routines.

176010397,My first psychiatrist who diagnosed me didn’t believe that anyone was stalking me but rather I might be stalking that individual. I was so offended because I wasn’t that sick I guess.

176010426,I have to agree with _AT_MENTION_. I’m not saying don’t go. Just that maybe you should get a therapist to talk to before you arrive so you immediately have some sort of support. I’d also line up a psychiatrist before you get there. It’s really important to have support when you’re making a big change like that.

But it seemed to me that everyone had fallen into a routine, and they weren’t really involved in therapy. I think that at the time I just wasn’t ready to benefit from intensive therapy. I don’t know if I ever will be."
176010463,"No. Don’t say things like that. You will make them miserable if you hurt yourself. They will feel that they failed you for the rest of their lives or didn’t give you enough love and care. And there are literally millions of people that are more or less in the same situation that you are. Just think of all the people going through rough disesases like cancer or they might be in a wheel chair or paralyzed or other things that put them in a position where they rely on other peoples help to live. First of all it’s not your fault that you are in the situation you are in, second, there is nothing wrong with needing help from others. People help each other every day, long term too. It doesen’t mean that our life is a failure just because we rely on help. Please try and stay positive and see life from a birds view instead of just your own personal situation.

I wasn’t talking about this… But maybe, to have only suicidal thoughts since kid, damaged my brain… Its known now, that the depression damages the brain later … And thank you for the compliment, dear . But my intellect is not on his best now. I often skip lots of the info around me… I even doesn’t hear it sometimes… I am just in my head, with my pain there… Try not to go back with the suicidal thoughts. I was very ill since very long and still think I have my chances… Do you have anxiety too? Or some physical symptoms because of your illness? The physical symptoms are a big part of mine… I also struggle to talk sometimes, I can suffocate by anguish, i
ts terrible… But lets hope meds will help even more in the future, its possible . Otherwise, I still deal with lot of irritability towards others, but I work on this… and I am very sensible to all kind of conflicts around me and pressure…I close myself then, which sux… That’s why I say I can be avoidant… I need to get stronger now . Well, I still wonder how some people are helped by the meds only in months, cause this is a complex illness, but we are all different yeap. The meds don’t act very well against depression and anxiety or even paranoid thinking… Even less on my conversion disorder (the psychosomatic stuff). Keep going you too, _NAME_. Hugs"
176010508,I think you should go to therapy with someone who does DBT. It helps you learn to control your emotions so you’re not constantly flying off the handle and yelling and throwing stuff. My best friend has BPD and it helped her a lot
176010509,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Yeah that’s what I thought but thought I’d check. Because when I took it last time I was very ill and in an institute. For about a week I saw illusions and ‘minor’ hallucinations but I didn’t mind because it was nothing new. It was interesting actually. Kind of mesmerizing. It went away eventually probably because they started me on antipsychotics for other reasons. So… I can’t imagine what it would do to someone who has Sz!

Yeap, for many people, I am probably a sick person to have take these meds… but well, someone told me, that I have a different mind from everyone, it’s a special one too and on me, benzos are a big help I find… I have one friend who is “subscribed” to xanax daily till all her life, but she doesn’t worry on the benzos… they help, yes… But which one you prefer personally- ativan or klonopin? I took only klonopin the last years. My doc gave me ativan now and it’s a bit different… it puts me more to sleep I find and is better f

174344371,"_USER_ID_: I have a psych degree and am schizo. Summary: this might help you out with your delusions _PERSON_ that sounds a lot like what I have. Sz is really kinda a blanket term for several different illnesses I think, or maybe it’s a spectrum or something like that. With meds the feeling everybody’s pain thing has gotten a lot less intense for me. I felt I was helping them by doing it but through a thought experiment one can determine that those people are still feeling pain. You can ask them if it still hurts. So all that pain is for nothing and it is in fact a sorta delusion unfortunately. At least for me, but I know determining that we (ie other schizophrenics) aren’t just imitating you as part of the ‘plot’ can be difficult to do. But why would I tell you that (in case you, like me, feel that you are the chosen one when in the midst of these episodes). Idk I got off track there, but ya, you’re not alone and I know it’s almost comforting to think that all of our pain has been du
e to something else or that we are chosen or that it at least is helping others but it’s fortunately or unfortunately just a brain condition. I know it feels like seeing through the veil and maybe it is to an extent…does it feel like a cosmic battle? That’s what I felt and meds will make that go away. But I know it’s fun to play it sometimes it’s comforting but. Well. It’s just schizophrenia and it’s hindering your time on Earth to do other stuff like family or art or music or research or any number of things. You can still study weird phenomena and have weird beliefs but without the pain and suffering and without stumbling down rabbit holes. I thought the moon was an evil spaceship housing aliens that feed on our negative emotions. I was convinced it could be destroyed and peace would return to earth. But it’s just the moon. We are none of us the center of the universe. It’s just the way our human brains process seratonin when we have a certain genetic. It makes us think we are Gods because 
that was an affective adaptation evolutionarily like a crabs claws or birds decisions to fly south. For millennia is schizos convinced others we were super special, but now with science and technology we are sadly revealed to be frauds. Talented frauds, but frauds nonetheless. But if you want to keep living in that sci fi world you can. This may be hard to read. But I like truth and this is what I discovered."

174344380,I think you can do a lot if you have to. I was pretty sick and I worked the first six years I was sick. I went through 7 jobs so I couldn’t keep one very long but I managed to do it. I was pretty bad off the first six years too. Extreme paranoia and delusions and hallucinations. I shouldn’t have done it because I got SSDI easily but you don’t know what you don’t know. I had two mortgages and an upside down house in Southern California and a son in high school. When he graduated I thought I could stop and drop my pack but he decided to go to college. I kept working. You have to do what you have to do.

Now, that is not to say that I’ve had perfect clarity all the time, but it does mean that I don’t believe 100 percent into my delusions. I still get confused at times, but those are becoming rarer and rarer, and I also get more and more insight each time. As for what it feels like when you get it, well, it makes you feel amazing and silly at the same time. It makes you feel amazing by finally being freed of major, terrible delusions. But it also makes you feel silly because you just came out of a delusion that you felt was 100 percent real; and delusions don’t feel too good."

I will try harder to exercise to help boost my metabolism. Anyway I’ve lost 6 pounds in 18 days. My goal is 10 pounds per month so I think I’ll make it but it would have been nice to lose 15 and surpass my goal, I don’t think that’s going to happen. The really great news is my appetite is finally under control. This first month of using slimfast has really paid off in terms of shrinking my stomach. Last night I made spaghetti for the guys and carefully measured out a serving for me that would fit within my calorie allotment. I could only eat half of it before I was full. So next month when I’m back on food I’m confident my portions will be small enough to continue to lose. I will just have to be careful to eat 3 times a day to keep my metabolism going because I have a bad habit of not eating all day and then binging."

176010641,"I have had symptoms since as long as I can remember. Hallucinations, delusions, paranoia the whole deal. Eventually I learned that no one believed any of the stuff that I was going through and they would just laugh at me thinking I was playing pretend or was being crazy so I stopped talking about it. I still believed everything I went through was real and did not question anything until I was 17 and a friend had a sort of intervention for me. It still took years after that to fully accept that I had a mental illness. My illness drastically impacted my life. Growing up with this whole other world that I had to keep secret basically isolated me hugely from others. I did not feel I could have meaningful connections with anyone and was very lonely even when I had plenty of friends. Also a lot of what I experienced was very terrifying and it traumatized me, I have ptsd from my psychosis."

I’m pretty good at it and have done a lot over the years so I know how to do it and all but it’s not my favorite thing to do. If I had one thing to put together I would be like oh ok no big deal but I have a lot. I have a table, 2 stools, a tv stand, a nightstand, a platform bed, which is going to be hard I think and a dresser. Then I have shelves to put together also that will be coming. I have about 3 weeks before my mattress comes and I start staying over there. I figure I should be able to build all that in that amount of time.

176010669,So my younger brother got back from the hospital. He is now going into a dual IOP program for substance use and mental health issues. Unfortunately we are stuck dealing with a lot of legal stuff since a) he had very illegal drugs and b) he had it at school. We’ve had to get a lawyer which is really expensive. My brother has also been expelled for 90 days and is being required to go to this juvie school that is not close to us but my mom will still have to drive him every day. We feel this was an awful ruling because how is he supposed to get better when thrown into an environment with other kids with a million problems too? And his crime is nonviolent. Who knows what other kids he will be with. I haven’t been staying at home but apparently my mom has been getting drunk all the time and the other night she was so wasted my younger brother (the one with all the issues) had to take care of her and as he was helping her to bed she told him he was the reason for her marital issues (which I’d like t
o point out started way before any of us were even born). My parents have been sleeping in different beds lately and apparently their fighting has been bad. My dad is just a ball of stress and is doing the best he can while also having a job that he works at 12 hours a day and having to manage a lot of household stuff that my mom just can’t anymore because her functioning has been disintegrating. Basically everything is just a mess. I feel very sad. It’s like as soon as I got my inner life sorted out and not chaotic anymore now my outer life is falling apart.

176010672,"Can I bump into this topic a little bit? Thinking metaphorically, not literally, but in representation, consider the following. There is a light source, a source of light (any kind) and it is casting its rays of light outwardly. In path of some of this light, is a material object, which interrupts the paths of the these rays of light. That interruption casts a shadow, behind the object. Secondly, also dealing with material objects, is the idea of newly formed objects, time, and corruption – or – enthropy, which is the shedding of energy (typically considered heat) into a vacuum or enviornment of some sort. So you brought up the gnositic conept of the demiurge. I would suggest that you step back a little bit and and consider a little more widely, that cosmology and what relates, with out jumping to conclusions. Consideration must be applied beyond a sort damning of materiality, and expanded to realize potential motivation or force of the Monad (Source) from which all Emanations are derived."

176010703,"Hey everyone. Site staff are talking about making a few changes to the site. The first change is to alter our categories slightly. We are planning to merge _NAME_ with the Lounge, combine the two Dx’_NAME_ sections into one category called “Symptoms,” and add a sexual health/relationship category. We are doing this because there are currently so many categories that it can make searching for the correct category a bit cumbersome, and because putting sexual health topics into their own category will make it easier for people to mute that category if they choose to. Since there was a bit of drama surrounding the initial splitting of the Dx’_NAME_ categories, we wanted to get everyone’s opinions before we merged the two back together. I want the Dx’_NAME_ SZ/SZA and Dx’_NAME_ other categories merges into one category called “Symptoms” I want the Dx’_NAME_ categories to remain seperate I have no preference 0 voters Our second discussion is whether to consider the debate over euthana

I can be dizzy or too smashed or too tired and its all changing in a day. Were your meds tough for you too in their start? Will I get used to the side effects?

Now I would always advise people to start with these hair filcking american spiders and thats because the other option is old world tarantulas. (tarantulas from the rest of the world, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australasia) Old world tarantulas are usually very fast, moody, very defensive and their venom is usually far more potent than new world species.

176010770,"I get where you’re coming from _AT_MENTION_, and can’t say I disagree with all of it. In the interest of not being pro/anti-psychiatry, I’m not going to say what I do and don’t agree with, just to say that you make some valid points, and that there is more to schizophrenia than a black and white approach. Things in life are not that simple."

174344424,"I take clozapine 175mg paroxetine cr 37.5mg clobazam 10mg escitalopram 10mg 10mg lexapro(escitalopram) at 8am is working so damn well for ocd but I’m so tired/sleepy that i wake up at 3-4pm on it. I have tried all the different timings of taking the meds like divided dosing, all dose at bedtime etc - they don’t work. I believe bedtime dosing doesnt work cuz clozapine decreases serotonin and lexapro increases it, so they prolly cancel each other out ? Only 10mg at 8am works perfectly. What should i do about tiredness and being sleepy ? Modafinil and coffee worsens my psychosis. My next option would be to stop lexapro and add prozac - but it inhibits 2d6 and 3A4 - which would further increase clozapine and paroxetine blood levels. Increasing clozapine is bad - cuz it worsens ocd and anxiety and makes me less likely to tolerate any SSRI."

176010782,"Yes it is new…I never had this weird fear. I think it is good to discuss it. I was kind of an outdoor girl and always relaxed in this respect. I think it has something to do with mum, yes. Mum is severely ill and it makes me anxious. Mum also has a real sensitive nose now after chemo and started commenting on my body odor, telling me it changed and makes people judge me. She is also obsessive about her own odor, like bad breath. Also, i started going out in circumstances - job, dancing - again where hygiene is important. So im more self-aware that maybe i lack in that respect. It made me very insecure."

I don’t miss making loose associations, but not all the connections were unrelated to each other. I believe that schizophrenia is a genetic adaptation that makes people capable of altering timelines and manifesting their beliefs, and if it were seen as a Gift and not a disease more people would realize this is a Gift that has hidden potential which we are shunning and ignoring as a societal whole. It seems that a certain amount of “rational” norms must be shed in order to obtain the awakening of schizophrenia. The Ego itself has to be questioned, and for people with schizophrenia our Ego dissolves first, and we begin to manifest our thoughts or unconscious beliefs so rapidly that it becomes distressful. We begin to lose context of what we can manifest, the difference between external and internal reality. Consciousness itself 
is a mystery. But I really think Ego death, attachments, imagination all of it plays a role in how our symptoms come into play. My perspective was that if I deprogrammed myself from Mainstream ideas that I would never recover that I could and without anti-psychotics. I was successful at that for a few years, but due to financial strain and stress I’m back with my parents. Financial/poverty and society/perspective all lead into this schizophrenic system."

176010897,"I did a lot of fun stuff as a kid. I was happy I guess. Ithink I started becoming unhappy once I got to high school. I skipped 8th grade and went from 7th grade to 9th grade. I was a year younger than my classmates and it really made a difference. I was already shy and not that great looking and so I could forget about getting a girlfriend or even talking to girls for four years. in four years a few girls liked me so I guess that’s something. But I just had no skills at making friends so the first few months I was by myself. Anyways, I had a couple friends outside of school and we did various things. We rode our bikes, and played football and baseball. The girls on our street would come out and we all hung out. We went fishing, just did a bunch of fun kid stuff. They sometimes ganged up on me which I can’t forgive and the abuse got bad but it blew over and we were still friends."

176010924,"All supplemental income programs are technically welfare programs, from state/national health insurance to disability to SNAP and everything in between. They’re programs that contribute to the welfare of society, because without those programs all of society would be worse off. The word has taken on a negative connotation, but the whole reason we have those programs is to stimulate the economy. When poor people have money to spend, they spend it on housing, food, clothes, transportation, etc. Without welfare programs, you get things like the Great Depression. People lost a lot of money overnight, then they had nothing to spend on necessary goods, so shop owners, landlords, repairmen, etc all lost a ton of business, so then there was even less money to spend on things. Welfare programs were introduced to protect society from ever experiencing such a devastating blow again. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about using welfare programs. You use them to buy things in the world, which helps everyo
ne stay afloat. They’re not handouts."

It’s not as simple as coming off the medication will fix any problems and the threat of relapse is very great if done so. I’ve never believed people were plotting against me, but did think for a while that I was a successful entrepreneur, when I’m not, I often took the form of established businessmen, whom I believed were “code” for myself, basically people that didn’t exist, except in their true form of _NAME_."

176010955,"I was thinking about the traffic tickets I’ve been given. I’ve been driving steadily with my own cars since 1997. I used to get pulled over occasionally and if I count a few times in the 80’s, I’ve been caught red handed by cops about 10 or 11 times. Funny enough, I have been guilty of traffic offenses 8 times that the cop just let me off with a warning. Usually it was speeding. The first couple times it was like 12:00 am and the streets were deserted and I was speeding and got caught. I told the cop I was hurrying home because I had to be to work early the next morning. It was just something I came up with on the spur of the moment but the cop let me go without a ticket. Exactly two nights later: same time, same street, speeding again. Pulled over and gave same story. Let go again. All the other tickets, this time I was clean and sober and didn’t lie. I got pulled over, I was polite and calm and admitted my guilt. Apologized without kissing ass. The cops let me go. My most serious offens
e was about 5 years ago. I was on the freeway and I needed to take this off ramp. I was going too fast and was going to miss it and I pulled onto it at the last minute. What I didn’t notice was that it was closed off for about 50 feet with cones and a cop was parked there. I took the ramp but realized my mistake at the last minute I had to swerve to try to get back on the freeway. The cop nabbed me. I just got out of the car and was acting so apologetic and contrite and looking really serious. I wasn’t kissing ass but the cop was taking himself way too seriously and I did play to his ego a little. The unfunny part was that he told me that he could give me a ticket for reckless driving which was a minimum $1000 fine. AND I would lose my license for a year. That scared me and I poured on the apology’s. And he bought it. I told him I was on the way to a job interview. He lectured me for a minute then just let me go. I couldn’t believe my luck. It was one of those things in life that your life could chang
e in a minute and it was very sobering. I rarely get pulled over now. Last time was about 4 years ago when I was living in the board & care and didn’t stop completely while making a turn from a freeway to a city street."

I hear voices once in a while usually at night after a lot of stressful events… Can anybody weigh in on this? There are days where I’m symptomless And I am able to be in big groups of people when things line up exactly how they should… But I notice when they don’t and I end up stressing out a lot more than I should I end up having the worst symptomatic day than I should Usually I’m a creature of habit and get 5 out of 7 days symptomless I stopped my invega sustenna 8months ago Since then I’ve had a problem being over controlling and attatching myself 
intensely to things going my way And if they don’t I get really really stressed out Having a schedule for myself helps me stay symptomless Im considering starting a haldol 1mg But I don’t want it to exacerbate my very difficult dystonia … This is really what I’m scared about… I didn’t have to deal with anything like this before… Im trying to decern whether this is withdrawal or just my mental illness The half life is about 48days My last shot was 78mg I’ve been taking APS for over 13+years Winged off over the course of 2 years Some part of me wants to get on a small Amount of an AP For a few years and get extensive therapy done about all of this… But again super scared it will exacerbate my parkinsonism symptoms Please analyze what I wrote to the full extent ! Also One last thing is My bf helps me make the day line up perfectly the way I need it to to be symptomless … Because I’m pretty sure that I may have trouble taking care of myself to some degree… Like for example I might forget t
o eat breakfast or lunch because I spent the day in downtown looking at clothes And If I do that What it does is create stress in my body and exacerbate symptoms… Anyways Thank you for being understanding One main question is Do you believe the over controlling is part of my schizophrenia? Maybe I’m over controlling because of how scared I am about life… I wonder if that can get hashed out with therapy Maybe I need therapy for that…

I was doing well on such an old school anti-psych med called Melaril but that they quit making it, so I was forced to go on Risperidone. I take 0.25 in AM and 0.5 in PM. I’ve been very pleased with it, although I do experience some drops in blood pressure and tachycardia. In fact, I used to sleep walk, constantly, and since going on the Risperidone, I’ve only slept walked once! As far as my auditory and visual hallucinations go, I find that they too are much better managed on Risperidone, because they mainly happened at night and Risperidone gives me a full night’s rest."

176010983,Saying that transexualism causes birth defects is delusional and confrontational. It’s not true and cannot be true. What IS true is that being transexual can be caused by development issues during gestation. People born with extra Y or X chromosomes or other proble s can later find they do not agree or feel like their assigned sex
176010984,"Mental illness has been hard on me, too. I thought I’d catch a break if I stayed on meds. I’d date someone nice and have a job, and life would slowly get better. It used to be that I could work but after all these recurrent episodes, my fatigue just got worse and worse. And I’m not sure about the dating part anymore. It’s also the case that a lot of my friends and family seem to be suffering way more than me. I feel like it’s shallow to simply pursue that house and family. And I’m learning that life often does not work out that way. I once had that depressed spirit for a few weeks after I finally got stabilized on meds, but I haven’t felt that heavy since. I think I realized I still had things to live for and I needed to think about my future whether I like it or not."

Unfortunately, THC is well known for exasperating schizophrenia, so my next choice would be hemp-based CBD oil. It has no THC and reading up on the benefits, it’s often taken for anxiety and apparently has helped some people with their hallucinations and delusions? Has anyone here tried this before and can testify if it helped them or not? Even if it didn’t help with your psychosis, I’m curious to know how it’s affected people who have taken it.

174344470,"en.wikipedia.org Evolution of schizophrenia The evolution of schizophrenia refers to the theory of natural selection working in favor of selecting traits that are characteristic of the disorder. Positive symptoms are features that are not present in healthy individuals but appear as a result of the disease process. These include visual and/or auditory hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and major thought disorders. Negative symptoms refer to features that are normally present but are reduced or absent as a result of the disease process, i... not sure i completely understand all of this article but it seems interesting… can anyone confirm if this is what i was thinking of being the advantages of sz?"

I can’t shower, it brings back all the memories and the sound of the water is almost hypnotic. I’m hyper-vigilant, both with everything that’s happening around me and of the possibility that everything I hear and see might actually just be a hallucination. I react to imagined sounds thinking they’re real, I ignore real sounds thinking they’re a hallucination. I don’t trust anything I believe. The most real universe is the one I’ve been told doesn’t exist, but I haven’t been there for a while, even though everything here’s been blurring together. The PTSD symptoms are possibly more disabling than the psychosis itself, but normal PTSD supports don’t help me. I can’t even tell myself that I’m safe, because it could all start again at any moment. Does anyone know what to do?"

I learned to be my biggest advocate as far as SZ is concerned. I had terrible experiences with Psychiatrists here. I had to learn about the condition, the medications, etc. How many times have I changed the view of my local Psychiatrist here? For instance, I was taking Abilify 10 mgs in the morning. At night time, around 8 pm, I would get severe depression. His view was to divert myself in some ways or the others. But, something had stuck in my head, that I was an extremely fast metaboliser of medications. In other words medication doesn’t last in my body for long enough. I convinced him then to increase the Abilify in the morni
ng, and ever since, there is no depression. This is but one example, but on countless occasions I have had to advocate for myself."

174344508,If you have positive symptoms then you need to take medication. For extreme negative symptom like catatonia also you need to take medication. The reason is in both the case you lose insight. On the other hand if you are aware of your issues and able to act accordingly without falling into emotions or feelings created by the illness then you can continue without the need of medication.
176011114,"They describe the differences between the (somewhat) objective measurements and personal subjective recovery. Using the PANSS criteria for measuring symptoms, 65% of the sample were in remission at 20-year-follow-up and 35.2% of the sample were considered in Fully Functional Recovery (FFR). Over 50% of participants described themselves as fully recovered and the average Recovery Assessment Score (RAS) was= 97.7. So 35% (of the sample) were considered in “fully functional recovery” but 50% describe themselves as fully recovered. Since 65% were in symptomatic recovery, the “fully functional” probably just depends on their personal expectations about what recovery is. In the full paper, they define what “Fully Function Recovery” as assessed by the authors means: We classified clinical recovery as ‘Full Functional Recovery’ (FFR) ( _PERSON_, 2012 ); a construct defined by combining remission status (from PANSS scores) with functional and vocational recovery status evaluated by the Quali
ty of Life Scale (QLS) ( _PERSON_, 1984 ). Functional and vocational status recovery was defined as a score of ?4 on 4 QLS questions: appropriate interpersonal relationships with people outside of family; adequate vocational functioning (being in paid employment, attending school or performing homemaker role effectively); adequate achievement in role adopted and basic living task engagement. I’d be more concerned about the other ~40% that was not available for follow up. (11% were dead). No way to know whether the same rates of recovery applied to them."

Right now they told me it’s 50 million trillion times more intensive torture than the worst tooth ache, but normally they just tell it’s just an infinite torture, both by intensity and duration. They tell me it’s an effective way to keep under control those souls that have a flaw in them (basically they point at the various things I’ve done wrong in my life and claim that I’ve done them because my soul is ill), otherwise they might reincarnate in a highly advanced and controlled society of psychopathic beings (supposedly they’ve genetically re-engineered themselves and removed compassion or/and conscience from themselves, because it limits them) and bring some trouble over there. Then they also tell me 
it’s just something they or me invented and they’re not really allowed to tell me why I’m going to be tortured. Recently they’ve been telling that it’s a lie that I’m going to be tortured and then again that it’s the truth, they could go forth and back like that for a while. Now they told me it could be “the Hell” you know from religion as well, but they are not certain from the code they can read from my soul (the code is there to calibrate and ensure I will indeed end up in that hell), they can only see I’m going to be tortured."

176011123,LOL. That is funny.
176011124,I think that’s a good way to look at it. My trauma changed me so much. And I guess it makes sense that I got so bad. This post has been insightful. Thank you for sharing
176011125,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. I feel scared too. I did not do anything to anyone but I think their family would hate me anyways.
174344505,"I started Zyprexa in mid-March of this year, and I have been looking for a full-time job for the past eight weeks. I lost a job when I was on Geodon and it wasn’t working well enough at high doses, then I took Abilify when I was between jobs, but it didn’t do the trick either. I went on disability in January 2015 when I was on a high dose of Haldol. It wasn’t until the Zyprexa being so beneficial that I was able to leave the house on my own, drive, and look for a job again. I am volunteering two days a week until I get a full-time position."

174344510,"I’ve come to accept the fact that I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Yet I don’t hear voices or have hallucinations, my schizophrenia is manifested by positive symptoms relating to delusions and negative symptoms of lack of motivation, procrastination etc. I got ill when I was 20, which is when most men get diagnosed with schizophrenia, so for that reason I have decided it makes sense to consider myself to be suffering from this condition."
176011127,I take my meds at 6pm. That’s the best time for me. If I take them sooner I get anxiety and if I take them later I feel like I’ve missed a dose.

I had really good treatment in BC, I think I’m going to move and try to talk to the pdoc I saw there, he was very professional, unlike all the pdocs at the unit in my town. they are the worst. in fact a doctor from a larger city not too far said I had PTSD with psychosis. I didn’t even tell him about the childhood trauma. he just talked to me for over an hour and knew without a doubt that schizophrenia was the wrong diagnosis. he’s so good that he travels from hospital to hospital all over the province. I can’t find him though anywhere online. but all his patients that I saw leave his office were absolutely grateful and happy that he was there to help them."

176011136,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ . I told some friends that I don’t like being told to smile, it really upsets me. Then they constantly taunted me with, “Smile, _NAME_, smile!” thinking it was a great joke. I am no longer friends with those people. It does sound like your friend is insensitive and possibly sadistic and cruel towards you. That kind of friend is harmful to you. I’m sensitive about my name. I only like people very close to me who love & care about me to use it. I have to wear a name badge at work so customers randomly call me by my name. I find that slimy. My managers also call me by my name a lot which is probably professional but it really irks me. I find it best to avoid stressors & triggers. Talking therapies just didn’t work for me, actually quite damaging. I rely on meds & minimising stress. Everyone is different so I guess you’ll just have to try some treatment & find what works for you. Have you got a mental health professional who can help you with de-sensitising you to your name?

176011148,"I wonder if it’s stress. I heard a woman very clearly in my head saying my name. I heard a woman saying “say it”, “when are you going to say it”, “are you gonna say it?” repeatedly. I keep hearing a whispering in my ear, but I can’t make out what she’s saying. I’m frustrated and a little creeped out. The thing is the stress is only going to get worse for a little while I’m going through the divorce and until I get my last kid graduated and off to college and I can get my stuff sold and I get moved. So until that’s all over I’m afraid I may be dealing with breakthrough symptoms, which really is the last thing I need. There’s no rest for the weary I guess."
176011149,"Not a good idea. Any of the three may cause drowsiness - the combintation definitely will. There are also anticholinergic side effects which may be cumulative; dry mouth, constipatiion, sexual dysfunction, mental slowness, etc. Both trazodone an Invega prolong the QTc interval and can result in life-threatening arrhythmias. There are other interactions as well, but this should be the one that you definitely know about. Talk to your pharmacist to be sure this is a purposeful and thoughtful move. Good that you asked. Always exercise caution with multiple medications."

176011172,"I feel a little worried like I can’t embrace my emotions anymore. I feel this hesitation to most emotions now because of the dulling effect of the medicine. Its like I’m responsible for my own sanity, and if I become irrational its my fault, and peaking emotions are going to lead me down a path where I’m going to be ultimately the one at fault for problems I can’t control. Its like I feel some sort of taboo around emotions now. Have any of you felt this sort of almost guilt? I dunno how else to describe it. I feel like I’m in a box a dull box, and if I emotionally get out of what feels safe, I’m going to potentially go insane. Is there any truth to that? I suppose the medicine is supposed to stop that from happening, but I still feel this hesitation almost a fear of expressing my emotions or experiencing the world as fully as I used to. The biggest annoyance to this is, I don’t feel like I “get” to feel happy, as every time I’ve felt really happy I assume I was in some sort of m
anic state. My depression has mostly gone away, but sadness is one of the only emotions I feel is “safe” because I’ve naturally been exposed to a heck of a lot of it due to this whole experience. Should I try to just wing it, and be happy? I’ve had depression since middle school and its been intermittent since highschool. Is it safe to be happy? I was in an argument with my brother, and I was feeling all sorts of strange sensations in my head, but ultimately I felt like I kept my sanity. It didn’t feel safe, it felt like things could’ve gone wrong… but happiness seems stranger. Do I just risk it? I don’t have much experience being happy, and less reason to be now that I’ve this condition. Let alone feeling like I’m allowed to be. How happy do people normally allow themselves to be anyway? I always picture people as being ground down by reality. Media makes reality seem like a cascading tragedy, but whom I to know anything about anything? What are your experiences with being happy?"

I used to have longer hair, about to my shoulders, but could never grow the front hairs long enough to have a pony tail without them coming out of the pony tail. Thats one of the reasons I eventually shaved it… it was always messy."
176011271,It’s not the noise that bothers me. It’s the water and wetness and the whole washing process. The work involved.

If I don’t precautions, I’ll sleep like 12 hours and won’t be able to get up even with a super loud alarm clock. However, I used something like this to get me out of bed and it helped a lot: I had my phone and a Bluetooth speaker in a bag. I had power cables running to both the speaker and phone. I got a Bluetooth speaker that would not turn off no matter how long there was no audio provided it was plugged in. I set my alarm on my phone and connect the speaker to my phone. I lock the bag. I put the key outside my room. When the alarm goes off, I can’t turn it off unless I get the key, which forces me to walk. I can’t hit snooze. That period during walking makes me wake up."
174344547,What are your thoughts about _PERSON_? I have to read about it.
176011275,Perhaps this is why men are fertile so much later in life. And why men often pick a younger spouse. They realize the gravity that is a marriage and want to figure some things out first.

176011277,"I remember when my aunt wasn’t stable on her meds she believed and feared the government was watching her and listening to her thoughts and nothing we said made a difference. All she ever talked about all day were “kitty cats.” We didn’t have the heart to tell her the government isn’t interested in what cat videos she was watching or which cats she thought were cute all day. She now doesn’t have the government thoughts but she still is trapped inside the mind of a 10 year old girl. I was always worried I would get like that, but so far it hasn’t happened."

Maybe though you meant being symptom free and I have takes on that as well but fortunately my positive symptoms were mostly contained to a three month period, stressful as sin though nonetheless.

174344558,"I’ve tried to kill myself 3 times, twice within the last 2 months. The first time was 4 years ago when I first started experiencing schizophrenia with pills. I was hearing things and was feeling severe pain that drove me to go out to a lake near where I live and take 2 bottles of blood pressure medication and a bottle of 2mg xanax. Online it said that the pills should be enough to kill me for my weight, but they didn’t. I woke up and was lost in the woods, hallucinating vividly from a lack of oxygen to my brain from the pills. I saw my drug dealers who had guns and were leading me through the woods threatening to paralyze me if I didn’t walk. They led me through thorns for an entire night and by morning I was torn to pieces, bleeding badly and completely lost at a large lake. I was exhausted and defeated. Not only did my suicide attempt fail but now I was dealing with the aftermath which ended up being worse than the experience of trying to commit suicide itself. I ended up lost for 4-5 days 
at the lake without any food or water. I was eventually found by a couple of fisherman after I found my way out of the woods and to the lake itself. I ended up being rushed to the ER with hypothermia and covered head to toe in lacerations from thorns that tore through my flesh and left scars I still have today. More recently I ran my mom’s car in the garage for 3 hours trying to kill myself from carbon monoxide poisoning with no luck. Then I bought a gram of heroin and used a syringe to shoot up as much as it would hold. I overdosed and ended up in the ER after my friend found me turning blue in the bathroom, not breathing. I don’t know how to stop this cycle of suicide attempts, and it seems like I wish for death all most daily. I nearly tried again today but couldn’t afford enough heroin to do the job. How did some of you who have been through that sort of thing get back to wanting to live or did you?"

174344567,"There are two different phenomena; 1-The sz in itself (isolated from all factors ) is a mentally in root origin or genetically 2- The effect of sz’s pathogen over the human nature is mentally or genetically It was suggested that the sz itself be defined by organizing popular election,which each person casts a vote,and the voters must choose ,at their will between the sz nature have to be a mentally or genetically ,and the definition would be determined according to the majority of the votes ! There is also another suggestion,the possibility of dealing with the sz’s nature as being has a dual nature such as the nature of light * particle-wave * ( body-self) (brain-mind) (biology-psychology )( mental-genetic) it is understood that the light behaves sometime as a particle ,and sometimes as a wave Thus according to the whims of the person; If the sz has acts / behaves mentally,it is considered a mental illness If the effect of sz be treated medically, it is considered biologically Because,the oblig

I sat almost all morning until 1pm ran a couple of errands in the afternoon ie dropped lunch off to my husband. I am so tired but too lazy and scared to go to bed.
176011352,"I can explain this for you so you can understand it better. There are different layers/levels to consciousness and perception. When I was psychotic or in an episode my thoughts and beliefs became my reality and I quite literally could not perceive the difference. It does not mean that the delusions are reality. Because if you realize that the thoughts make no sense, you can break out of that pattern of delusions/false ideas. But there is often a reason we disconnect and experience derealization. I wonder if some of us do it to distract ourselves from trauma or pain but that’s not always the case. Learning to love yourself by merely accepting that the alternative is much better, that there are no cameras in you. Your mind is telling you that people are saying it when they’re not. That’s what its like and why its such a scary illness. My mind was telling me all sorts of things that I thought everyone else was hearing or saying and then I realized that no one else could hear it but me. I won’t 
go into detail because more details about what happens during an episode wouldn’t be comfortable. Just trying to help you though I’m not a therapist or a doctor. Its what helped me. I stopped hearing voices. I learned to stop believing that everything I thought was true was happening…"

Looking back I wish I would have just pushed through my fears and overcome them on my own without the assistance of a drug. Long term use is linked to memory issues and really only masks the problem. My psychiatrist said it like this. “Medications can help assist us when we need the extra boost to get through something difficult, but it takes work on our part as well to see things through.”"

176011369,"Well, how many of us question their own sanity ?"
176011370,I have to go to bed early to get up for work. If I don’t get 8 hours minimum I struggle. I just slept all weekend too. Seems like a bit of a waste but my body needs it
176011371,"I just got better like an hour ago, took 6 Tylenols today. My fever went down and almost no headaches. Yesterday night was the worst, couldn’t sleep from headaches and fever, I took 4 Tylenols to sleep. I think its worse at the beginning and then it gets better. Hopefully no more symptoms. My parents have it worse than me though, runny nose, fever, headaches and lots of coughing."
176011372,Should I call my psychiatrist?
176011373,"Ptsd has minipress, aka prazosin. I take it at night. It helps."
176011374,Glad you saw a doctor _AT_MENTION_
176011375,Its safe and good for short term.
174344571,"We taper off slowly. I first met him a few days ago. He did the haldol injection and it was painful, but I don’t mind. For now we decreased zyprexa. We must lower abilify and clozapine too"
176011376,"Does SZ in general interfere with my life? Absolutely! Dropped out of school when I was 16. Would have done it at 15 but in Canada at 16 you don’t need your parent’s consent. Has f’d up numerous jobs, relationships, everything. I guess now I’m pretty functional… I have a job that pays above the lowest average salary in Canada. Though I did decide to go on short term disability. First time I’ve ever done it. I usually just keep skipping work until I either quit or get let go. Decided that I wanted to try and do things proper this time. Winter is usually a pretty bad time for me. Definitely affected by seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Just been really ??????? sick and tired of being sick and tired. Been thinking about finally seeing a psychiatrist, maybe try some meds. I don’t know though. I’m kind of back and forth with the idea right now."
176011377,Beautiful _AT_MENTION_ !
176011378,"I lactated until I quit zyprexa in March 2019. I’ve been off APs since. My levels caused osteoarthritis and osteoporosis at age 25. I’m 35 now, my daughter was born 2006. That was way too long, I had to pump it was so bad. When I was pregnant I had no hallucinations or voices, it was part of the reason for having 3 pregnancies in 4 years. But I’d get post partum psychosis when the baby hit 6bmonths old, so we’d decide when they turned 9 months old to get pregnant again. But my levels were high no matter dosage of anything. And since meds didn’t work anyway we’ve just gone off period. Just adding benzos to help the panic attacks. The hallucinations and voices have never bothered me, I know what’s real and what’s not, so my pdoc just has me do a 45 min call a month and my husband and I say how things have gone, she knows I’m not taking school opening ok, and since my physical pain has made me unable to drive now I am housebound except to go to pain doc on the 31st. My husband is now 
doing everything in the house as far as errands, taking and picking kids up from school, etc. I can’t take AD for anything either, so I stick in my headphones and that’s my life. My kids are getting used to an 11pm bedtime since they gotta get up at 4:30am to get ready and school still has no idea what they’re doing for ????. I’ve given up my mother role and now accept I am a mooch and with the crap in _NAME_ right now with riots, my lidocaine IV infusions are gonna be postponed. So even longer with no pain relief. We had to switch fentanyl patch brands as the adhesive on the other brand ate my skin, but it worked better. This one is not helping. I’m not sleeping again."
176011379,I wonder about having a drink! I have been wanting to have a drink with friend I’m scared I’ll compromise my mental health by doing so…
176011380,Same with me. Really disturbing. Thought broadcastIng right?
176011381,I could have sat home all day ruminating about everything coming to a head in my life and how parts of my life suck. But Kentucky fried chicken and diet Coke at the park is funner.
176011382,"I hope you all realize that whether you remember it or not, you still hurt these people and they have a right to feel however they feel about the situation. They don’t have to believe you or ever forgive you. You still have to apologize, and try your best to make sure it never happens again. Whether that means new meds, therapy, or whatever. You are responsible for your actions even when you don’t remember them, and you are responsible for making sure you don’t hurt others."

176011387,I was a unhappy child. I suffered a lot and felt unloved and unwanted and remember crying why does no one love me. I was bullied for being ugly in Onsala which hurt and depressed me. I had some good moments but everything was mainly heavy and depressed and hopeless. I was a mentally ill child. And teen. I hated being a child. Since I met my x in sa I have been the best I’ve ever been in my whole life that I remember. He is one of the best things to happen to me and so is my sacred neigh n former stepmother. Welcome to the forum. Are you new?
176011388,I agree. My theory is that neuroinflammation overstimulates the brain so you end up mired in thoughts and not wanting to do more than that.
176011389,"I’m very much frustrated in my life. For example, there are many things around this apartment that need fixing. When I speak to the landlord about them, he says, “No problem, I’ll get it fixed.” But nothing happens."
176011390,Who knows? Maybe they have thoughts crazier than us.
176011391,"Yeah, it usually slows down about this time."

176011395,"Im currently on clozapine but the damn treatment resistant ocd induced by clozapine has made my life worse. We are tapering down clozapine and increasing amisulpride right now. I would suggest you go on low dose clozapine if amisulpride fails you cuz haldol is not much effective for positive symptoms. If low dose fails, then expect the following side effects Heres the list of side effects i got on clozapine treatment resistant ocd and other anxiety/panic problems huge sedation even worse than a benzo huge weight gain and sugar cravings myoclonic jerks bed wetting hyper saliva Postural hypotension and more which i dont remember"

176011398,I live in a home that is staffed 8am-10pm. I suggested moving with my sister today but they said I am too unwell. I dont see it. I’ve been in and out of homes for the last 4 years. Doing it on my own never got me anywhere so I guess I’ll just listen to what they say. I feel like my functioning is average

176011401,Got it _AT_MENTION_. Thanks for the info
176011402,"A combination of cardiovascular exercise, calorie deficit and nutritious eating will make you lose weight. I had a high of 341lbs (RED) to a low of 323lbs (GREEN) in just over 2 months time since the new year. So 18lbs so far this early in the year. image1095×1287 111 KB"

176011404,"i was diagnosed, and then recently rediagnosed. so now im double sure i have it! when youre having such severe symptoms, it can be hard to tell if you have it or not. lack of insight is another symptom that the doctors will typically point out for you. its best to leave the diagnosing to the professionals!"

176011406,"I don’t think you can buy D-serine or D-alanine. There’s some concerns about the potential side effects of them in humans for long term use. there is a concern that d-serine might induce nephrotoxicity in humans, as is the case with rats ( 143 ). Evidence indicates that nephrotoxicity is due to d-serine metabolism by DAAO, as rats that lack the enzyme do not develop glycosuria nor polyuria after high doses of d-serine ( 144 ). I used to use beta alanine but I had to stop using beta alanine as it gave me pains in my internal organs."
176011407,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ .
176011408,"I am considered high functioning because I work, but I still have to battle symptoms. I haven’t had a full-on psychotic break in 12 years, though I deal with some psychotic symptoms to this day. Even more in the way of mood symptoms and anxiety. I would say I was on the edge of a break around the time of New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day a couple years ago, but thankfully I got my depot shot and it calmed things down. But yeah, I suppose I’m pretty well recovered. I’m just not 100% better, not even close, and I don’t doubt that I never will be 100% recovered."
176011409,Good but promise yourself that you not react to bad emotions or thoughts which will surely come due to withdrawal effects.
176011410,"old ideas like working it out in a gym style routine. newer ideas like just stifling it in a religious style (especially for women) challenging the thinking that causes the anger. would you like to add to my list? i’d love to see some more new (and old?) ideas. and have a happy labor day weekend to all us americans here. hugs, _NAME_"
176011411,Aww _AT_MENTION_ . Sorry to hear you are in pain. I am glad your surgery went well. You know I wish you a full and speedy recovery. You are the Star Lord to my Spiderman in Marvel Ultimate Alliance. I’m looking forward to seeing you recovered so we can continue our journey as super heroes.
176011412,But what if you’re only dreaming that you’re dreaming?
176011413,_AT_MENTION_ This is great advice. I try to think of it that way as well.
174344585,One of schizophrenia symptoms is lack of thoughts. It can improved throughout the years. I and other people take SSRI medication to improve it

She and girls are at work all day in week and I’m alone with dogs and bird. Usually would keep myself busy and watch movies or read etc. But now had no interest in anything at all. Reading? Abandoned book Movies? Not interested Series? Not interested Music? Lost its appeal Dancing? Too tired Looking for a work from home job? No strength at moment Prayers? Too much effort Nothing but messing around on phone and sleeping for hours in day.

176011416,_AT_MENTION_ the forum is for overcoming delusion not to convince others they’re true. This is a delusion. The tv says so much it would be weirder if things we thought of were NEVER mentioned.

176011424,I quit once. Relapsed and needed to be hospitalized again. I once reduced from 12 to 9 mg of Invega and heard voices 24/7. I say that if you have no symptoms anymore you can try to reduce your medication under the supervision of a pdoc. If you still have symptoms you need your meds. You can always try to switch meds but that’s treacherous waters.

174344583,My maternal cousin had sz. He’s dead now. He shot himself cleaning a gun. Some think he committed suicide. As far as I know the coroner said it was accidental. He wasn’t taking his meds when he shot himself. This information came from his father.
176011433,I wish I could find 100% rye bread.
176011434,"I’ll just elaborate a bit on my earlier posts. Im not saying that there’s something wrong with people who don’t recover. Some illnesses seem to be chronic and that’s just how it is, it is no one’s fault. And sometimes people recover, doesn’t make those people extra valuable. It just is what it is. Has a lot to do with lots of factors, some out of our control, for instance, we can’t control our genetic predisposition. I haven’t recovered myself, I keep getting delusional. And if I come off meds who knows what would happen."

176011437,"I see I didn’t word my message clearly…I meant maybe my autism was always schizophrenia. The neuropsychologist diagnosing me (as an adult) told me she was wavering back and forth between the two diagnoses. I wasn’t aware of my delusions at the time, hadn’t hallucinated in awhile, but tested as having a schyzotypal personality, and had all the “negative symptoms” — which also characterized _PERSON_. I do not think I ever had _PERSON_, but rather either classic autism (I spoke late and there are many other differences between me and those diagnosed with _PERSON_, but not with the autism label) or just schizophrenia."

Eventually, I switched to Abilify and my libido came back. Maybe try some different things and see if there isn’t something new you enjoy. Or, maybe it’s time to consider trying a new medication."

176011440,"I didn’t start thinking until it was pointed out to me that I was mentally ill. I was active, but not doing anything particularly thoughtful.

And yes, I should’ve maybe private messaged you. I really did think a lot of you, and I’m sure I still do. But, I kind of got hooked on you and up until recently, I had a bad habit of doing that with certain people. I guess I’m a little codependent that way.

176011523,"I had/have this exact problem after I got hit with my first psychotic episode. I used to be more extroverted and social where I could make the group laugh and tell a great story. After psychosis I couldn’t even say hi without seeming awkward. The ONLY thing that helped was forcing myself to stop analyzing my interactions. Even if I am awkward, Im going to appear 100 times more awkward in my brain when I am doing constant play by plays as we are our own worst critics. I know its hard but, be mindful you dont say anything that can get you in trouble and try to stop pushing being normal. Forcing normality is the easiest way to be awkward, and as long as you’re not crossing offendable lines there isnt any reason to worry about keeping up with everyone else when it sacrifices your own comfort. Ultimately from my own experience, take some of the pressure off of yourself when it comes to social situations. It’ll help you be less awkward and it will help you worry less about being awkward. I know it
s 100% easier said than done, but if you can work on that then social interactions will be easier. Anecdotally they were for me."

After stopping my meds, the nasal congestion went away and also the stiff, sore muscles, excessive thirst, dryness, and peeing. I actually feel good, and I feel alert and want get out of bed and do things. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, it takes 3 to 6 months for symptoms of schizophrenia to come back after stopping an antipsychotic.

Either they come out of it on their own or they don’t."
176011640,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I had no control on myself and on my emotions on all other meds. My brothers had to beat me up to stop my addictions and stop my aggressivity. But I keep thinking that a new med will improve me and refuse to stay in bed all day. My family don’t believe so because I was violent physically and verbally on all other meds. I don’t know if I will lose control on myself with Vraylar. Its a dopamine agonist so it will likely cause issues but at the same time I don’t want to stay in bed.

They gradually brought the dose down to around 60 mg, monthly. While I was on that does I was drinking huge amounts of coffee, taking a lot of ephedrine, and doing moderate exercise. I could get myself pretty amp’_NAME_ up like that. I messed up, and they were going to put me on 40 mg daily again, but then they relented and put me on Zyprexa. After that I was put on Geodon and Seroquel, and I have been happy ever since. Geodon does weaken me dramatically physically, though."

176011670,I have a conspiracy theory concerning remotely assisted train of thought followed up by relevant messages in TV ads or lyrics in songs on radio which follow.

I told him straight up face-to-face that as a paranoid schizophrenic that we are known to kill people when in psychosis. He said to me, “What’s your point?” and I told him, “you’ll find out” after we finish our shift at work. I waited for him at his car outside in the parking lot and we had a brief talk. He asked “what are you going to do?”. I said, “what do you think I am going to do?”. He said, “I don’t know?” and I said, “that’s good”. I walked towards him one step and he backed away one step. I had 2 Swiss army knives in my hand and I was going to use them on him. Some people intervened once.

176011697,I can empathize 100% with _PERSON_. I expect things to take a turn after they have been too well for a good stretch. Being sza a lot of things can take a digger. Having PTSD I worry about running into my abuser. I have more money now but what about when my car needs repairs. My dad and mom and grandparents aren’t going to be around forever. _NAME_ is my friend but he gets fed too much. Like _AT_MENTION_ said there are things we can control and things we can’t. We can easily spend time worrying about the future but the present is going to be gone in an instant. My solution. I enjoy the small things while I can and these things are just for me. I love a good cigar once in a while. I like to try new foods. I go birdwatching. I love to read. I practice gratitude for the small things I have. I avoid the news. I do my best to sleep well. I can tell you I’ve burned people like my mom and grandparents out by constantly asking for reassurance. But they have just about as much to gain or lose as I do de

So if you tend to get positive symptoms then avoiding parkinson drugs is useful even if have parkinson like symptoms as positive symptoms create worse consequences when compared with EPS. Careful dosing of AP is crucial especially if get AP induced EPS.

174344690,"_PERSON_ I will talk to my psychiatrist about the Strattera and ask if I can get an EEG. But I also have had other symptoms which are what led me to believe I may have a brain tumor. Last year I passed out randomly no explanation. I went to ER they gave a heart scan not a brain scan. They said everything checked out normal. Could not find a cause. That narrows it down. The random fatigue/dizziness, ringing in the ears, morning headaches, muscle numbness. nausea. It makes the most sense because the symptoms are getting worse too. They assumed I was dehydrated. For the past two weeks I’ve been woken up early in the morning with a seething migraine in the lower back of my head. My ears started ringing constantly before I developed symptoms that got diagnosed as chronic schizophrenia. Recently my vision has gotten worse, blurrier/vision loss. I have astigmatism in my eyes that isn’t normal for people of my age. I’m a 31 year old woman and my visions gotten worse for the past four years. I have to 
wear glasses and I can’t see anything far from me. Not only do I have ringing ears, constant headaches in the morning that go away after I drink coffee and take strattera, but also numbness in my hands and legs that started this year too. Where my hands or legs fall asleep randomly. Sometimes with pressure sometimes without. I wonder if it always was something else not schizophrenia. Would be really sad if I found that out almost don’t wanna know at this point. But I can’t know until I get a scan. I have a brain tumor.....

176011765,I’ve been Seroquel taking it since it first came out in the late 90s. I was taking 400 mg but I’m now stable on 200 for Many years. The only side effects for me are dry mouth and chapped lips so I sip water and use Chapstick. There were a lot of post about it back then too bad with the new forum they are all lost. I had agitation so the relatively sedative Seroquel was perfect for me. Take your full dose in the night and wake up fresh. Or things were really terrible I took up to 800 mg and it would knock you out and you could sleep it off. But picking a med is always trial in terror. Just have to see what it feels like for YOU. Good luck in your search.

You can be standing in a group of 1,000 people and still feel lonely. You need to be kind and compassionate to yourself; you need to be your own best friend. And, no, it’s not selfish to feel this way. In fact, I don’t think it’s possible to love someone else if you don’t love yourself. You deserve no less."

176011795,it wasnt a delusion it was a fear
176011796,I sorta know your mind-set and know where your coming from. Its a release for me to act out mad in the privacy of my flat - and scream and and swear blue murder to my voices. Letting “go” for a short period gets it off your chest.
176011797,"I agree and for me, it was like “the dangers of benzos” was the only reason they ended up being bad for me. Me being the 20 year old addict self medicater I was, everyone would tell me “oh wow benzos are amazing u gotta try them” so when my pdoc prescribes them to me I tried abusing them but I didn’t feel ???? on high dosages so I took an even higher dosage and blacked out ended up in the hospital. It’s one of those drugs that “if I knew I couldn’t get high on it”, obviously I never would’ve tried. And I can’t get high on it. It has no recreational use for me. Strictly a medicinal drug for me that I made a few mistakes with because of what I heard about it. I’ve taken 1.0 a day for a long time. I think at 1.5 I’m too tired and at .5 it used to not be enough. I used to always take 1.0 for years until I found naltrexone it’s eased my anxiety and allowed me to lower my klonopin to .25 which I’m on now with a little extra if I need it as a prn. My pdoc is a very good pdoc 
and he loves to prescribe klonopin. I know a few other pdocs who changed their minds on it over the years to prescribe it now"

174344687,If I knew every schizophrenic in the World I may have a clue. If I were to guess I’d say no. In a sense if we all were creative you could ask if we made the voices up which I personally didn’t.

Delusions have made some psychotic people lose insight, and their delusions were of a nature that made them physically violent, in their eyes for a good purpose. I would like to belive that I will never be physically violent again …and I did notice that I at least questioned if I was lacking insight the last time that I was hearing voices, so things had changed from my first psychotic episode where I did not question my lack of insigh

176011817,"_AT_MENTION_, that’s a really cute pic! You’re not ugly at all."
174344689,"Well, that’s a given, that’s how Social Security works. But I’m not clear, are you in the process of applying for Social Security or do you have it already? If you’re in the process of applying you really want to make a good case to Social Security about you’re disability. When I applied initially in 1980, I didn’t want to make myself look bad i.e. mentally ill with schizophrenia. So when they asked on the application what my problems were I wrote, “Emotional problems” and that’s it. At the time I had just gotten out of the hospital and was living in a group home and the staff had sent me to the Social Security office with no help and almost no advice to apply on my own. I was 19 and freshly diagnosed and had no idea what I was doing. I was denied of course. My parents called them up to talk about why I was denied and my parents told them I was mentally ill and the worker told them that they don’t award Social Security for “emotional problems”. Anyways, eventually we got a l
awyer a year later who gathered all the facts and I described my symptoms and how I felt to him and we went to court and I got my benefits on the appeal. I’m sure you won’t make the same mistake I did (if you are still applying). Tell Social Security as much as you can, tell them your symptoms and how they affect your life and well being. If you are already on SSDI or SSI and you want to try working there is nothing wrong with that. Like I said in my previous post, they are set up for people who want to try working. They have rules to help you with an effort to work. But if you want to work it’s up to you. If you want to try it’s up to you. You’re right, If you and your doctors say you’re disabled and the SSA administration awarded you benefits already than you are entitled to them. I’ll leave you with this. If you have SSDI already I’ll give you one simple piece of advice that you can follow or not. It’s what my parents told me when I was 19 and just got out of my first psyche ward and the 
first thing I did was get a job even though I was sick. They told me, “Don’t worry about working, just concentrate on getting better.” I don’t know how old you are but if you already have SSDI than you have months or years to get ready to work. I mean if you’re feeling like you have a chance at succeeding at working than go for it, you don’t know until you try. It’s a risk but there’s such a thing as a calculated risk. If you are fairly stable and feel you have a chance of succeeding it’s up to you if you want to try or not. I’ve worked for years, so have many other schizophrenics. A little part of my secret to being able to work for almost 35 years is luck, hard work, a lot of help and that I’m probably too dumb to realize that I can’t do it and that on paper I really shouldn’t be able to do it. But I just do it anyways. Anyways, whatever you decide I hope you succeed and I hoped this helped a little."
176011818,yea but maybe you gotta find a way to accept it… but it’s ok if you don’t accept it if you keep taking your meds… if you stop taking your meds because of it then that’s not good…

176011826,"I get suicidal thoughts chronically, no medication has helped. I’ve learned to postpone it. I think “I’ll wait for such and such” which is like a week away or something. Then I usually stop thinking about it. I’m generally over it by the time the thing I was waiting for happens. If I’m not over it, I postpone again. If all this doesn’t work, then I get on the phone to a friend and talk about anything, but not my suicidal ideas - that just freaks people out. Being distracted by a normal conversation can really work. It can get you out of your head and be grounding. It’s horrible and I hear your suffering, I hope it goes away for you soon."

It’s forgivable, as long as you don’t slip into old habits, keep slipping, and lose that drive to get healthier. But the only person to forgive in this situation is yourself.

174344729,"I tried doing some math, I think it’s completely different and probably wrong, but I think I made some progress in a different way. 3.65 million Americans have schizophrenia. I came up with the Probability(You have schizophrenia in a lifetime | You have Norovirus in a lifetime) = 0.19% or 629,872 Americans, which doesn’t much mean anything because it shows you not everyone who contracts norovirus gets psychosis (duh!) and that it’s not the root cause of psychosis, but may be my cause or a cause. I should try the calculations on bipolar diagnoses. It could be several different viruses each virus being specific to a certain individual. I’m pretty certain and convinced of this. I remember stuff like total recall. I believe we all have a quantum brain and when we get these viruses or illness, ???? goes haywire and all of of a sudden we get a false scenario going on like spirituality and God when reality it’s math and physics and logic lol.

176011924,"I’m inclined to say it is a bit of both. Inserted because you think they come from aliens, and intrusive because they are, obviously, intrusive, but you don’t seem to feel that the thoughts are being inserted, and that feeling is crucial to the definition of thought insertion. Another thing somewhat related is thought blocking or thought withdrawal. I lose my train of thought sometimes, but I don’t experience that my thoughts are being actively withdrawn. Do you feel like the thoughts are actively being inserted? Or do you just drift from one thought to another, partially related, thought? In DID (dissociative identity disorder or MPD, multiple personality disorder) and DDNOS (dissociative disorder not otherwise specified) it is not unusual to have thoughts that seem to come from an alternative personality. I’ve experienced this at times, and it did not feel like the the thoughts were being “inserted” and they usually were not “intrusive”. -_NAME_."

176011928,"Absolutely. I am on a ketogenic diet. It helps immensely with symptoms. I would argue that it’s even better than antipsychotic, but I feel absolutely amazing on it unlike medication. I do still take anti-psychotic. The thing with the ketogenic diet it actually gets your body into a state pretty much identical to fasting. The ketogenic diet was found when they discovered the epileptic patients were less symptomatic when they fasted. They developed a diet to put epileptic patients in to essentially constant state of fasting. They do this by limiting carbohydrates and providing adequate protein and high fat. In fasting your body is in a state called ketosis. In the ketogenic diet you are also in ketosis. In ketosis, the body burns fat for fuel instead of sugars. I noticed when I’m doing intermittent fasting, which is fasting from anywhere to 16 to 24 hours. If I have my diet down well, I feel absolutely amazing and symptoms are better."

174344758,I’ve been on it twice. The first time i went from 135lbs to 180 in less than a year. I lost all that weight when i weaned myself off of it. In 2017 i went on abilify and the weight gain wasn’t so bad. I went up to about 170 pounds which wasn’t a bad weight for me. Last year i had a really bad psychosis and ended up switching back to zyprexa 20mg a day. I went from 170 to 240 pounds since september. Now i’m being weaned off of it slowly and swtiched to latuda and i haven’t noticed any side effects from it. I take 10mg of zyprexa at night but i’m hoping to drop the dosage to half a pill at night soon. I’ll do that for a while and hopefully i don’t go into psychosis. Zyprexa does help with psychosis but i still hear voices but i’m learning how to block them out as well as the intrusive thoughts. I have OCD and schizoaffective disorder.

What helped me feel better was exercising. You start off small and build up slowly. You simply have to do for yourself or you will feel worse and worse.

What I’m experiencing currently is very, very different to anything I experienced then. September 1st to 5th (2019) : Took 5 mg of Abilify (Noticed my confidence levels beginning to decline, slight depression/dread/panic beginning to creep in, creativity/cognitive abilities seemed slightly diminished) September 6th to 15th (2019) : Increased dose to 10 mg (Symptoms listed above became worse, and developed severe restlessness) September 15th to 23rd (2019) : Tapered over a period of 1 week. Restlessness improved but other symptoms became slightly worse September 23rd to 30th (2019) : Depression continued to increase. On the 30th I started experiencing the worst case of depersonalization I’ve ever experienced. Severe depression, thoughts and emotions gone, could barely function cognitively. I’m a bit calmer now and the depression 
has subsided, but the main symptoms haven’t improved still. During my previous episode of depersonalization/derealization I could read, think and function more or less normally. I’m profoundly gifted and could make it through a 300 page novel in about an hour. Loved reading, writing, puzzle solving, had very strong opinions, etc. Now my mind is completely blank.

It’s tough for me to work up the gumption to leave the house and when I do, it can be hard for me to interact with others. I take vistaril and it doesn’t help with the anxiety. I have tried propranolol in the past as well, but it didn’t really work either. I’ve been working with my therapist to overcome this social anxiety. He wants me to get out more and calls it “expanding my comfort zone”. Unfortunately, the anxiety is still sticking around and ultimately feels like it’s limiting me in life. I’m curious, what (if anything) has helped your social anxiety? I noticed it seems like a lot of you guys also deal with social anxiety."

176012096,"Psych wards aren’t exactly five star resorts. For one, you’re often stuck with really ill people. That’s never fun, it’s stressful, and there’s no getting away from it when you’re there. At the tail end of my jail sentence I was sent to a hospital with inmates who might have actually committed violent crimes. I didn’t like it there, made friends with one guy who spoke mostly spanish, and kinda kept to myself otherwise."

176012102,Hello everybody I got a question from my doc how long do I want to take Sarcosine? Should it be constant suplementaion or for some time? I am not sure what’s better to me. Can you tell me what do u think guys?

176012105,"To be honest, I don’t really think my meds, that are supposed to assist sleep, work that well on my chronic, episodic insomnia. Meds like Geodon, Seroquel, Trazodone, and Klonipin. But, in the last month, I have been taking a totally legal form of Marijuana or THC called “3Chi” Delta 8 THC edible gummies. I don’t get high off of them. They just put me to sleep 4 hours after taking them. They work really well. They’ve changed my life. I’ve gone from trying and failing to sleep all night and then sleeping all day long, to retiring early at around 9 pm and waking around 4 am. I’ve gained many, many more hours in my day. This is such a gift. God told me He was going to change my life completely. Well, I guess he has!"

174344788,"I mean there are no tests performed to diagnosed the illness. Psychosis can be caused by many factors like stress, drugs, anxiety and lack of sleep or maybe inflammation of internal organs or indigestion. It is so easy to prescribe medication, Pdocs dont even know every antipsychotic, they only work with few available, for example in my hospital all they had was haldol, risperidone and olanzapine, when I mentioned Aripiprazole they acted they never heard of. 1 week of learning can become a psychiatrists, its so easy! for example, psychotic yes? just give bunch of haldol and risperidone - easy fix! person cant sleep? just give quetiapine! depressed? Just give any SSRI on medium doze and low tricyclic. dont forget to dish out Ativan and depakote with every mood disorder. Pdocs rarely listen to patients and mainly rely on nurses (thats what happened to me, my pdoc talked 1 time within whole month in a hospital and did not ask about what medication I want to choose). I mean you dont even have to know h
ow anti psychotics work to prescribe them, you only need to know that they make you a vegetable! drooling, mimicking, dystonia are just side effects that patient has to deal with it and because there is no medication for it - problem solved."

176012134,Do you think there could be something implanted in my ear that can show my thoughts on the phone like subtitles?
176012135,i’d stay on the meds… it sucks to have to relapse harder than the last time… maybe in time you can reduce the dose a bit but i would be careful with it.
176012136,"Well i live in eastern europe and our healthcare systems are similar, so i think if you dont how up for the shot nothing gonna happen. I wanted to ask if the nurse which gives you the shot is tracking your visits? Cause i did stop meds in UK and in my country - Lithuania no one really tracks if you take meds or not"
176012137,The best method is to use your cpn to fill it out and attach photocopies of important documents for you. That is what mine did. When I applied myself I got nowhere. Talk to your community nurse and ask them to sort this out for you. I signed mine and gave it to him to fill out as they have access to your medical notes and should have some experience in this department.

She was concerned and asked will I feel safe for next week, so I said yes I think I will. She wants to see me next week Tuesday again. My Seroquel is being raised to 200mg now for next week. Amisulpride stays at 200mg. She didn’t want to lower it due to me struggling with psychosis symptoms. I asked her how can I get rid of Alien and his evil plans, is it only with meds? So she said yes. Kinda makes sense - on the right meds he went away. But at moment he wants to try take me over. Fortunately it comes and goes in intensity. Hope the Seroquel increase helps! She said she’d want to push me up to 600mg depending on if the increase helps"

176012167,"I know the feeling. It does go away. Or, at least, it did for me. Be careful if you need to drive. When I was first on geodon, I would get sleep attacks sometimes. I learned that eating the full 500 calorie meal helped stave off the sleepiness until I was safely at work, and the exhaustion wore off in a couple hours as long as i kept moving. I would perk back up at lunch, and could safely drive again by the time I had to go home. I would take my pill at 7, arrive at work around 7:30 feel sleepy around 9, feel alert around 11, drive home at 3:30. In the evening, that was the dangerous one. I had juat started dating Mr. Star. On our second date, I had dinner, he turned on a movie, and I woke up at 6 AM. I knew he was the one though, because I woke up with a blanket, a pillow, and the door locked with him on the other side. He just wanted me to feel safe. Another time, I went to a party at my friend’s, and fell asleep on the couch at like 8 pm. That time I woke up covered in a pile of everyone’s c
lothes because my friends thought it would be a great prank if I thought I slept through an orgy. If you decide to do an evening activity, plan not to drive."

176012189,Another thing I want to mention… as it’s something to watch out for. The tendency to try to conform to someone else’s expectations is a horrible move when in pursuit of a relationship. It’s like growing a false appendage to the self… one that doesn’t really represent you… and one that you’ll likely resent inhabiting if you pass through those inevitable phases of feeling inappropriately cared for.

Second, it will give you something to do and give you an idea of what you can/can’t handle in a work environment- gotta keep it low stress. And third, you will need references to get a job, especially if you’ve never had one and have no explanation as to why.

One day, he came up to me and made an offer that I couldn’t refuse. He said, “Mom, if you quit, I will quit”. And that was it. We both quit forever that very day.

Blockquote The research showed that different combinations of C4A and C4B copy numbers generate a sevenfold variation in risk for lupus and 16-fold variation in risk for _PERSON_’s syndrome among people with common C4 genotypes. Paradoxically, the same C4 alleles that previously were shown to increase the risk for schizophrenia had a different impact on lupus and _PERSON_’s syndrome -; they greatly reduced risk in those diseases.

174344838,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Long-term outcome of schizoaffective disorder. Are there any differences with respect to schizophrenia? _PERSON_, L Sanna, V Perra, R _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Rivista di psichiatria , Jan-Feb 2014 A number of studies suggest that the clinical characteristics and long-term outcome of schizoaffective patients closely resemble those observed in schizophrenia when cases are diagnosed according to DSM criteria. The primary aim was to compare remission and recovery rates in a cohort of chronic schizoaffective and schizophrenic outpatients.A sample of 102 consecutive outpatients, 46 affected by schizophrenia (45.1%, mean age 44.22±9.97 years) and 66 affected by schizoaffective disorder (54.9%, mean age 43.00±9.07 years) was examined in the study. Personal data and psychiatric history were collected according to AMDP system; premorbid assessment was performed by means of PAS. Axis I and II psychiatric diagnosis was confirmed by means of SCID-I and II. Psychopathological status was 
evaluated by means of PANSS and CGI-SCH scales; neuropsychological evaluation was performed by means of BACS and MMSE; Functioning, subjective well-being and quality of life were respectively evaluated by means of PSP, SWN and WHOQoL-bref.Schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients investigated were characterized by an overlapping age at onset, mean duration of illness, mean duration of untreated psychosis and common sociodemographic characteristics; subjects' cross-sectional psychopathological and neurocognitive profiles were remarkably similar. However, schizoaffective patients are more frequently of the female gender, showing a better social premorbid adjustment and a somewhat more complicated clinical course in terms of more frequent hospitalizations and suicidality; outcome measures are substantially better among schizoaffective patients: rates of clinical remission were 43.5% and 54.5% in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients, respectively; 13% and 25.8% of schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients
, respectively, were considered as functionally remitted; recovery was observed in 6.5% and 22.7% of schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients, respectively; the majority of patients, both schizophrenic and schizoaffective, were taking antipsychotics, mainly atypical, although a significantly higher proportion of schizoaffective subjects were on mood stabilizers, antidepressants and benzodiazepines.Compared to schizophrenic patients, DSM-IV-TR schizoaffective patients may be considered as a subgroup of psychotic patients displaying several specific characteristics in terms of clinical course, clinical and functional outcome and treatment."
174344851,"I’m aware I’m luckier than most. And yes, I understand why the “successful” is in quotes. And I’m one of the ones who often says I was severely ill. Part of the reason I write my stories is because I started off as a typical schizophrenic. Specifically, a long prodamal stage, hospitalized for the first time at age 19 and diagnosed, followed by group homes and more hospitalizations. The first two years I had no relief from scary, torturous symptoms, felt suicidal many times. I had nothing going for me, felt hopeless and felt like giving up most days. But after two years I slowly started becoming stable, I then became employed. Now does any of that ring a bell with anyone? Because a lot of you guys start off roughly the same as me. I think a lot of people can relate to my beginnings. My point is that if someone comes on this site looking for support and hope and inspiration and maybe they’re in the first two or three years of their disease and sees my story (and many others here of course
) they might relate it to their own situation and realize, “Hey, things look hopeless and I’m suffering now but this guy was in my shoes and he came out the other end. Maybe I have a chance too, if I get help and take my medication and don’t give up.” Because at the beginning we’re all in the same boat, if a schizophrenic tries to do something with his life he may succeed, if he gives up and doesn’t attempt to do anything than he will surely not “succeed”. Hope for a better future can keep a person going and motivate them. I’m not insensitive to the fact that it’s almost impossible for some people with schizophrenia to work or go to school. But it was not easy for me to do those things or anything else for that matter. But I think even some people on this site who have had schizophrenia for years and maybe can’t work can get something from my story, maybe pick up a few tips for living. Or maybe people late in their disease who are thinking of working or going to school or trying to chang
e their lives can see someone who spent 8 months locked up in the hospital and suffered but came out of it to accomplish something in life. I mean isn’t what I wrote the point of why _PERSON_ and other schizophrenics like her write books about their story? I think success stories that inspire, motivate and give other schizophrenics hope are vital. What if no one posted any positive stories or what if no one posted their accomplishments or their victories? What idea would people on this site get if all we read is negative defeats. Should everybody give in to hopelessness and not even try to improve their lives? I know not everybody can do what I’ve done but the point is they can do something. I’m not judging or looking down on people who can’t work because of their illness, or who can’t cook or exercise or anything else. I’m not saying they can do what I’ve done but they may be able to still get something out of what I write. Nothing comes easy to me but with lots of help, lots of luck and lots o
f hard work I have done some things in life and maybe this is the basis for a “can-do” attitude in the sense that others may not be capable of doing everything I’ve done but still learn something from it or do more."

174344854,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Martial arts increase oxytocin production. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Scientific reports , Sep 2019 10 Numerous studies have demonstrated that oxytocin (OT), a peptide hormone, plays an important role in regulating mammalian social behaviors, linking it to social affiliation in parent-infant attachment, romantic and filial relationships, and other prosocial behaviors, such as trust and cooperation. Not surprisingly, research efforts have been made to increase endogenous levels of OT. In the present study, we investigated whether traditional martial arts training, which integrates the natural benefits of physical exercise with dyadic prosocial interaction, would result in OT response. To this end, 68 beginner and advanced participants were recruited from several schools practicing Jujitsu (""soft art""), a form of traditional martial arts originating in Japan. Salivary OT levels were assessed at baseline, immediately following high-intensity training, and following a 
cool-down period. Analyses revealed a significant increase in OT immediately after a high-intensity training, returning to baseline levels following a cool-down period. Additionally, although no significant difference between beginner and advanced martial artists was found, a significantly higher increase in salivary OT followed ground grappling, as compared to ""punch-kick"" sparring, indicating an added benefit of close contact tactile interaction. These results suggest that the reportedly socially beneficial effects of traditional martial arts may be in part mediated by OT release and underscore the potentially therapeutic applications of these methods for disorders involving social dysfunction, such as autism, conduct problems, or schizophrenia."

I do not have any solution how to break the cycle of staying inside, I suppose you just need to go outside, maybe just to sit on a park bench. The key is to start enjoying outdoor activities. I do not have a car and so I use my bicycle also to do other activities necessary."

It really can make a difference. If you have a broken arm then pain makes you seek some help. You have a broken brain you often do anything but. Book into seeing a psychiatrist is a must and being honest with your counselor and doctor can only help you out.

176012391,"Here are my ideas on how I held onto insight: A nurse sat me down and explained to me that I was going to have to take the medication latuda, that the doctor chose it for me, and that medication is something you have to take for life, like with diabetes She said, “I also take latuda, and it helps me sleep.” I had slept only 2 total hours in the 3 days before! When you get psychotic, you’re trapped in your head…you can be solipsistic. You can start to feel lonely…being around other people may be stressful. You are isolated withing your own thoughts, I was lonely for years…because of feeling isolated. When you leave your bubble, you might be fighting thoughts and feelings, which can make it hard to connect with people. So, in the psych ward I took the meds, and some of them helped me feel better. The psychotic break during the previous 3 days was the worst time in my life! Whether or not pills make any issue go away (“there’s a pill for that; etc.”) I was ready for a way out. Taking 
pills is a part of my life. I feel so privileged to have access to medicine, when so many haven’t got an option. Recovery is an individual thing…I went about it in the way I felt was best for me. It took determination. Some of it was luck. A big part of it was medicine. Another part, I believe, is to be adaptive, and to have a strong will. By that, I mean, you need to find something, anything normal to do, and endure and work hard to do it, regardless of how your symptoms make you feel. You need to try and progress; Job, Marriage, Making friends, Independent living, Reintegrating into society…you’ve gotta start up where you left off. You’ve gotta come back stronger, actually. You’re working with less, meaning you have to work harder…I don’t think 300% effort would be too much at all. Like in _PERSON_s story of her own post-diagnosis recovery: In the first video, she talks about her mindset, when it seemed that not only her; but also, friends, family, and doctors, had lost hope in her, too. To 
see a person w/MI recover as she did here, helped me know that I, too, could have a future, even though I felt that that I had no hope, when I first got my diagnosis."

176012394,"my university experience was a bit hit and miss. i didn’t get along with my roomate my freshman year. and i was not prepared to take it seriously at that point in my life and take the time to study. socially i had lots of friends and attended many parties. i only lasted 3 semesters before i dropped out. i got a job and continued to live in a college town until i was 22. with friends who were completing their degrees. i went to a big state university with over 40,000 students. my favorite classes were the big lecture halls where you could hide in the class, and nobody would know if you skipped class. my favorite class was psychology 101, my freshman year, the professor was intelligent and funny and kept things interesting. if i had to do it all again, i would’ve worked until i was 25 or 26 out of high school and then gone to university when i would have had the money to pay for tuition. or maybe go to a trade school. all my friends graduated but i was not as responsible and drank a lot and smoke

How do we fight _USER_ID_ if we can’t stop believing it ourselves? The worst part is _USER_ID_ within the mental health community. People complain about people with different mental illnesses such as bipolar, or depression, different personality disorders, or how annoying people with OCD are.

174344912,"I’m sorry, _AT_MENTION_-ploravit . That angers me, too. I HATE when a movie/show/media does that. It’s so cruel. It’s like they think a schizophrenic or mentally ill person isn’t watching their show. We don’t seem to exist in general outside of mental institutions, in their mind. I wish the world could see the mentally ill from our perspective. We’re just people like everyone else."

176012604,"Yes, my anxiety is always a trigger for when things get worse. My first psychosis was when I was anorexic and because of that, I was in an enormous amount of stress. The second relapse happened when I lost my dog and was very depressed about it, which made my symptoms worse."

176012606,Thankyou _AT_MENTION_ Hope you’re well too… Maybe having more faith would be a good thing for me. I need to speak to a priest or something see if they can reassure me like how u do.

I’ll admit that usually schizophrenics delusions have a smidgen of truth to them I think if you could find some way to get some sleep you will wake up realizing that some of the beliefs you now we’re possibly made a little hastily… I know exactly how you feel right now I think because ive been there. And some of it is real. But after meds which help you sleep and relax trust me you’ll get a chance to think really deeply and see all the stress and quick decision making you’re having to make atm because you’re panicking … Some of the beliefs really are false. There might be some truth to it, but I promise it’s not as big as you think it is."

174344917,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Elevated serum anti-NMDA receptor antibody levels in first-episode patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ An, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Brain, behavior, and immunity , Jun 2019 12 Accumulating evidence has shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors (NMDAR) are implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and that patients with NMDAR antibody encephalitis develop psychopathological symptoms. Therefore, we hypothesized that NMDAR antibodies play a key role in the etiology of schizophrenia. In this study, we enrolled 110 first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FEP) and 50 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive function and psychopathology were assessed using the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), re
spectively. NMDAR antibody levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed that FEP with schizophrenia exhibited cognitive deficits in all domains of the MCCB and had elevated levels of serum anti-NMDAR antibody compared with the healthy controls (9.2 ± 3.5 vs. 7.3 ± 2.9 ng / ml, t = 3.10, p = 0.002). Furthermore, serum antibody levels were positively correlated with PANSS positive, negative and total score, and inversely correlated with performances of verbal learning and memory, working memory, speed of processing and MCCB total score in the patient group. These results indicate that elevated levels of NMDAR antibody may play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, leading to NMDAR dysfunction, thereby inducing symptoms of psychosis and cognitive impairment. Therefore, NMDAR antibodies may serve as a biomarker and provide a new avenue for treatment of schizophrenia."

174344919,"Abstract Background: The outcome of schizophrenia and related psychoses is generally modest, and patients display high rates of disability. Aims: The aim of the review is to present an up-to-date account of the research on the very long-term outcome of psychotic disorders. Method: We conducted a search in the PubMed and Scopus databases for articles published since the publication of the very long-term data of the World Health Organization’s International Study of Schizophrenia (the ISoS study), over the last 18 years (from 2002 to 2019). Studies were included if they reported on at least 15-year outcome and if they had used valid and reliable tools for the estimation of the patients’ outcome in terms of symptomatology and functioning. Results: A total of 16 studies were included in this review, involving 1,391 patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses. Most were single-center studies, with moderate size samples of patients, and 11 were prospective studies. Very long-term outcome of psy
chotic disorders varies considerably among studies. Good outcome ranges from 8% to 73.8%, and it appears to be better in developing countries, whereas differences are less apparent among Western countries (8%-40.3%). Studies in different settings have used different methods involving a variety of samples of patients to estimate their outcome, whereas definitions of good and poor outcome also varied among studies. Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with worse outcome in some studies. Schizophrenia was found to have poorer long-term prognosis compared to other schizophrenia spectrum disorders. A large proportion of patients, ranging from 19% to 48.2%, were not on medication. Conclusion: Recent evidence on the very long-term outcome of psychotic disorders is in line with previous reports and suggests that prognosis remains rather modest. There are several limitations of current research regarding outcome definitions and study design that should be addressed by future research. Keywords: Outcom

176012656,"It would likely be the the most valuable pharmaceutical ever developed. Exercise helps people learn, deal with stress, drastically reduces anxiety, improves mood by lifting people out of depression, and strengthens focus. Students with higher fitness scores have higher test scores. Exercise primes the brain to learn faster. If your dopamine isn’t working properly you can find it hard to get things done because you are not getting enough fulfillment to justify doing them. Exercise boosts motivation by increasing dopamine storage and triggering the creation of dopamine receptors in the reward center. 30 minutes jogging 3 times a week is just as effective as Zoloft. Frequent exercise allows your body to become much better at reacting to stress."

The trouble with a broken mind over a broken leg is that pain will get you too a hospital to get some action on the leg. With a broken mind the thing that isn’t functioning properly is making decisions that it shouldn’t be based on shadows. You were unwell for sure I’d say.

176012743,"_AT_MENTION_, are you familiar with the thought that some schools in sociology perceive mental illness as simply a deviance from societal norms, therefore everyone is still a functional member of society? Also note the idea of medicalization here- society medicalizes life and often leads people suffering from diseases to have negative results from the treatment. Sociology is such a broad field so many ideas can come from it."

176012780,"if you need time alone, just do it, but always leave an option for help. my way out was adequate time alone, time alone doesn’t mean you are outcasting yourself, but for you to get back into your own shape, into your own “true” form. Maybe you were very affected by relationships that caused you to become like this, and these relationship doesn’t amount to much and feels like either you were trying too hard or you don’t feel reciprocated in your own sense. So from this surface knowledge that i know from you, it seems that you need time to understand yourself, what you need, what you need to set boundaries of, who to avoid (not to cut off connections but to spend lesser time with that person), and who to cut off. If your parents are the ones “hurting” you, then spent lesser time with them, and seek for “help”. Find answers and seek them, like what you are doing now. second, to tell your parents or not, it’s totally up to you, but do not expect them to understand you, or to underst

174344955,"I never had any hallucinations, neither auditory or visually. My symptoms were paranoia and delusions. I spent ages 19-20 in a home for schizophrenics and at age 21 I spent 8 months in a hospital. I’ve never successfully explained my illness and what was going on in my head to anybody. I could describe specific delusions and what I am paranoid about but my illness manifested itself so that in the group home at my worst I spent much time by myself fighting to hold on to my sanity. Oddly enough, at that time, I didn’t isolate too much. I was in a large city in California called San _NAME_ and I often walked around downtown by myself or hung out in the student union at San _NAME_ State university which was walking distance away. One symptom I can describe is racing thoughts. My mind was always going a mile a minute and I couldn’t control that or slow it down. My brain thought so fast that it felt like it turned into oatmeal or slush. Just thought, thoughts, thoughts and it was overwhelming. When 
I said in my original post that I was a 100 times better now, for one thing I now have peace of mind a lot and my thoughts can slow down. I craved this my whole illness and I am extremely grateful for it. My mind can get real quiet and sometimes I’ll be in traffic or in a store or at work, and everything gets quiet and I just stop and think! About anything, it’s a luxury I’m also grateful for. At age 58 I like to just reminisce about my younger days and some of my adventures and misadventures. It’s fun! When my illness was at it’s peak it was almost like I had amnesia. It seemed like I couldn’t remember not only my past before I got ill but I couldn’t even remember the week before! I think it was caused by stress. So I still feel symptoms and stuff drives me crazy but yeah, my mental health back in my twenties doesn’t compare to how good my mental health is now. The paranoia now is distressing but I still have lots of really good moments. Like my ex-brother-in-law said, “Life is a series of 
shorts.” I have many little great moments and experiences. I got better by taking medication, seeing the psychiatrists and therapists, quitting drugs, and just pretty much going along with what the doctors and my parents suggested. That meant vocational programs, day programs, support groups, family therapy. And those led up to becoming employed again, going to college, making friends, driving my own car, living independently and having great experiences and fun along the way. I’m luckier than a lot of people that I was severely ill in my youth as I mentioned, but I have always been able to work and do the other things I listed. I’m lucky, and I got lots of help but I also put in the hard work and did a lot for myself for my own recovery."

A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Rivista di psichiatria , Sep-Oct 2019 Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is recommended by the main international guidelines, its effective efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis is still debated.To evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in the treatment of psychosis.A systematic research was carried out for systematic reviews and _NAME_-analysis on the effectiveness of CBT in the treatment of psychosis, published from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2018. The selected studies were evaluated using AMSTAR 2, a valid and reliable tool composed of 16 items to measure the methodological quality of systematic reviews and _NAME_-analysis.20 _NAME_-analysis were selected: 2 of high quality, 5 of moderate quality, 6 of low quality, 7 of critically low quality.CBT is an effective therapy compared to treatment as usu
al, for positive, negative and general symptoms of psychosis (with a particularly large number of studies in favour of positive symptoms), with effects of medium-small size. On the other hand, there is no clear and convincing advantage for CBT over other psychological and psychosocial therapies for symptoms, relapses, social functioning and quality of life in people with psychosis even if today the quality of the trials available is mostly of low or very low quality and further research is needed to reach reliable conclusions. Further and more rigorous research is certainly needed also to establish the effective efficacy of CBT on secondary symptoms, insight and non-symptomatic outcomes. CBT does not seem to produce significant effects in the prevention of psychotic relapses."

Now, when he starts to get up to sleepwalk, he bumps into his guitar, and his unconscious mind just sits there and plays guitar all night. When he was a kid, I kept a lock on the outside of his bedroom door, because he would get ready for school and go stand in the middle of the road waiting for the bus at like midnight.

So far it seems I’m not the only who can tell that people hear my thoughts and usually react or make noises as if their annoyed by my thoughts. Symptoms: People around me behaving as though they hear my thoughts. Voices/inner voice in my head is sort of messed up ever since a spiritual experience I had a couple months ago. And the voices/voice sounding foreign or repeating phrases like commands. Also I used to think I could control it but I can’t and I guess my inner voice is messed up for good and I’m limited to whatever words come up when I’m thinking “deep down” or with feelings. Hopefully I can help or be helped and this “tb” thing can get put on blast for everyone to see or something. Although I’m realizing there are two people who write on these threads about it… The “tb victims” and “the people telling them to either take meds or see it as a delusion”.

privately? My goal rn I guess is to meet a person with the same problem and see what this thing is all about or expose it…

I’ve been doing that for a few years now almost. And it has gotten easier. Health foods, like a strong salad… Are surprisingly effective at staving cravings. Things like waiting to shower… Waiting until at least the eighth hour… Whenever a craving wave sets in around then… And then showering… Long warm shower. It’s does a lot. Takes only 20 hours for nicotine to half-life out of the body. Any time spent beyond that is the body fighting/learning to go on without it. A nice reward… And they should only be utilized every 6 hours… Would be something like getting fast food. Gotta find the things you can enjoy without nicotine. Exercise is great… Good food works… Sugar and candy work… Carbonated water works… But what really wins is knowing the importance of suppressing 
the need to consume things. Train the mind and body into being content without having to always be fixated on things. Drift and meditate… Force awareness out of the mind. It’s a life changer… Gotta be willing to accept simpler pleasures… But once you do, they are all around."

Maybe so. Who knows, we could have some type of constitutional crisis where lawyers turn out to be the glue that holds society together. But there are other jobs which I doubt the usefulness of. I sometimes think about what it would be like to have a strict socialist economy. They could have five different types of vehicles for the consumer, with not that much difference in price. We could use meat more as a seasoning than as a main course, with much less fuss over large amounts of fattening food devoid of nutrients.

But when i (in a kind way) said i did not like what happened last week, he told me if i would have said something angry with him in the car if i had taken his ride, he would have kicked me out in the middle of nowhere at night. He said that was what he did with annoying women - in a kind mood. Im scared. I did text the dancing teacher (he was my dance partner) that i stop. Im also paranoid now that i did something really really bad against God."

176012950,"Hi, so basically, after a calamitous breakdown and hospitalization in October. I am getting back on my feet better than ever before! BUT the stress of my new and highly demanding occupational activities precipitated some no small symptom return, leading to stress for my family, and I decided to abandon the plan to slowly taper that I had worked out with my doctor–safely–because honestly, I am definitely not ready. And it will be at least two more years, just my guess, before I even will be ready to consider that question again. My psychiatrist was/is really awesome / informed / nonjudgemental though. I got back on a similar medication and dosage as prior to my breakdown in the fall: Caplyta at 42 mg, once every other day. My psych says the research shows that at steady plasma states, even though there’s a comparatively short half-life to its contemporaries, most meds can be taken every other day effecting a half dosage. So yeah. Decided to give it a fair run, see how not tapering and just enj
oying stability goes… The stability and great reaction to neuroleptics that I’ve been blessed with… lol. I kind of had a profound conversion of heart / breakthrough moment in the hospital. And I credit some of the recovery to my work with my psychoanalytic therapist. Signed the contract for my debut book with a huge press: editor, publicist, book tour, TV/movie rights, big advance, et c. Registered for classes that start in three days(!) at my college I’ve returned to. Wouldn’t have been able to do this during my episode… Been accepted into my cocurricular psychoanalytic clinical training at the SF Lacanian School of Psychoanalysis… have classes there too. And, big one, I am now a Candidate monk at a cenobitic biritual (Eastern and _NAME_) Catholic monastery south of my home City. And yeah, I am sure this is what I will be doing with my life. It was years of pondering interrupted by sickness; now I’ve moved to doing. For the next year, I live half-time at the monastery instead of my family’s 
home. Am now running a successful freelance content writing / copyediting business… INCOME! Well, I’m sober and actually sleep now. Always more enjoyable. …Goals for the future include adding an online ethnobotanical garden/nursery business based at our monastery which operates in a self-sufficient homesteading way, to generate income for my religious community that I now warmly call home. AND saving for a _NAME_ so I and potentially friends or the other monks and nuns can travel to Yosemite or another wilderness or something for a little backpacking retreat/pilgrimage. Honestly I’m gettin there… Life is pretty joyful when you really just pay attention to the reality of things, not gonna lie. By the way, any good self-recovery books for schizophrenics??? I’ve found a lot of benefit from reading older psychiatric literature, and of course, spiritual literature, but I thought I’d ask. How are you guys though? It’s been a while since posting."

176012974,"Lamictal really helped me…I believe OCD is connected to anxiety and depression in some way…but I’m definitely not a doctor! I’ve dealt with severe intrusive thoughts before, and atypical antipsychotics made it worse. What helped was Lamictal, and being manic. So if you have mood cycling. You’re gonna wanna try a mood stabilizer. Sometimes antidepressants can worsen mania ttyd. …also GABA and L-theanine from quality vendors, I feel really help with ocd. Most importantly, CBT, meaning talking to a licensed proffessional. To untie OCD, you have to stop thinking about it logically. Just set a goal (touch door handles without washing hands etc) and give it a good try. I believe I have OCD…even since childhood, as well as depression and anxiety…but I haven’t been diagnosed. My advice… Be calm, let your anxieties drift away…don’t force it. Let the therapist help you stick to goals, like going out and socializing more. Getting in situations where you feel anxiety, and not dealing wi
th that through rituals…compulsions…etc. Let intrusive thoughts come and go. In and out, accept the anxiety, let it float away and drift through."

Today two people were complaining that payroll had messed up their mileage reimbursements. In some cases people were underpaid and some were overpaid. Apparently that position I applied for at the parent company is a new one because one man is doing payroll for 800+ people and lots of mistakes are made because he’s trying to keep up with everyone. Payroll is a mess. The people who were talking about it today told me to be grateful I didn’t get the job. I don’t really feel that way though, it would have been a challenge to get it all cleaned up, and after that, we could split the work between us and have a normal workload. I still see that payroll job being posted on Indeed, I just tell my
self that I would have been trained by now and helping out if they just took a chance on me. Oh well."

I followed the official YouTube video, washed my hands with soup and dryed them properly and I get that high level. I was browsing some website about blood glucose levels. But I need a professional measerement, so I will go to the pharmacy who sold me this device. I have since a month some of the symptom of high blood glucose levels. Like throwing up, weaknes(that way longer), there is also written that you pee and drink a lot. I sometimes go three times in fifteen minutes to the toilette or more than five times an hour, when I smoke and drink more around the day. I drink 4 litres and just today I didn’t drink anything with sugar for four hours to get a valid result, and have measered two hours after a meal like the pharmacist said."

174345000,"I dealt with severe akathisia from invega sustenna injection. I paced around the house and watched movies standing up. Due to the long lasting nature of a shot, it took three months after switching meds for the akathisia to go away. It’s a very scary symptom when it is severe, almost worse than schizophrenia. It goes away if you switch meds 99% of the time. There are a few cases where it is permanent but they are very, very, very rare. I think haldol is one of the older antipsychotics, which have a higher chance of akathisia than the newer or “atypical” antipsychotics. I’m currently on zyprexa and I get very mild akathisia every now and then, nowhere near as bad as it used to be on invega though."

174344998,"Your Pdoc is your only hope. There are two possibilities: There is the narrative and there is no hope. The more optimistic one is that your psychiatrist may be able to fix it. If you don’t have side effects from the Clozapine, then the doctor can raise your dose of Clozapine. The second thing that, if you feel it is true, tell him that Abilify was working better than Haldol. There is an easy way to know that: Reduce the Haldol slightly, and increase the Abilify slightly. See if you get better. If it does help, that would mean it was the Abilify which was more potent than the Haldol. Of course, I think the Clozapine may be increased as per the recommendation of your doctor, unless side effects become unbearable. You may get completely better at a much higher dose, and then decrease it, once you are okay. For me, the Abilify/Clozapine combination worked. But, Clozapine was giving strong side effects so I switched to Seroquel."

You have three categories of people when it comes to social justice, those who do something about it, those who make things worse, and those who are indifferent to social injustices. I think theres a small amount of people who make things worse, a large amount who try to do something about it, and unfortunately I think the majority are indifferent until it pertains to themselves. Actually I think everybody is indifferent to a lot of things, if we weren’t we would drive ourselves insane with worry and the feeling of helplessness. I say pick one issue and try to make a difference on that issue. I’m going to tackle mental health _USER_ID_, that’s what I’m going to try to change. It could be something

176013029,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ . I’m going to try the sitting down Tai Chi exercises once I’m feeling a bit better. Right now I can hardly move.

176013033,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, lets check in with each other. That’s great that you are walk/jogging. Good for you! That’s a good idea to cut out the bread. Bread, especially white bread, turns into sugar the minute it hits your stomach, I’ve heard. I’ve always paid for my yoga videos and I’ve never been much happy with them either. So, I don’t recommend yoga DVD’s. I do like yoga apps. Some of them are very low cost and are very convenient. I use the yoga app: Track Yoga. You can find it on Play Store for Android. It only costs like around $2.99 per month. And you earn points toward free classes."
176013034,What symptoms do you have?
174345012,"Just be careful not to over-analyze things. That seems to happen with a lot of schizophrenics, everything takes on a sense of importance. It’s still just life, and sometimes you’ve got to wing it. This disease has made me think and feel things I wouldn’t have normally felt. If you’re the type of person who blames yourself for negative thoughts (not saying you are, but some people are), you’ll have a hard time with this illness because it will insert negative or dirty thoughts of all kinds into your head at random sometimes."
174345009,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to update the forum on my status even though it’s been a difficult week for me. A couple weeks ago, I started to deteriorate mentally - trouble focusing, intrusive thoughts, images, and voices, etc. That Wednesday night, it got to the point that a demonic image and voice that was intruding through my thoughts was commanding me to stab myself and my partner, and the compulsion became almost too much to bear. So I took 100 mg hydroxizine to calm myself down, and my partner drove me back to the hospital where I was inpatient a month ago. Fortunately, after my dose of seroquel was raised from 600 mg to 800 mg, my symptoms subsided after about three days. I stayed for another four days and was discharged today. But my doctor notified me that I’ve maxed out on the seroquel now, so if the symptoms come back and become unmanageable, she strongly recommends that I switch to clozapine. It’s so frustrating to go through this, but I feel like I’m doing the best I can. I’m r
eminding myself that no one got hurt which is a really big deal considering how bad I was doing. I had the option of trialing the clozapine in the hospital, but I didn’t want to give up on the seroquel completely before trying the highest dose. Plus, clozapine requires a weekly blood draw for the first six months so I wasn’t quite ready for that. Anyways, that’s all for now. I will try to stay positive and keep journaling. One day at a time for now. Take care, _NAME_"
174345015,i m sorry for your suffer start from beginning take them regularlly be sure to eat healthy like omega 3 chocalate and fruits and vegetables and balanced diet what eases negative symptoms i find it is it is vit b12 espicially sublingual and injection good too pls dont miss dose
176013035,"Your right as well, very nice post . However my deluded mind thinks they are giving me a long break because they feel guilty about what they will be putting me through when they come back (they said they would be making me go insane and that I won’t be coming back from it)"
176013036,I find coffee to be helpful. You can use it as a crutch to propel yourself to start new activities. I think motivational videos exist. Like _NAME_ talks… which are short and succint. It keeps the attention span.

I’m on 600 mgs of seroquel and started taking it after I got out of federal prison after over 4 yrs in December, my doses have been increased slightly throughout these 7 months, anyways I’ve always had paranoia from it and I think a lot of it has come from being in prison for so long and hearing about all the massacres and ???? that I feel like I cant trust ANYONE OR ANYTHING now. it drives me absolutely insane, but without the seroquel I cant sleep like literally at all. Idk what to do does anyone have any advice, I’m so severely desperate. Thanks for your time in advance"

All I care about is money and thats the basis of our relationship. I cant take care of myself, Im lazy Im stupid and I cant get my life together. All this started when The guy came over to gice an estimate on the sprinkler leak… I offered to fix it for them last week but she doesnt trust me to do handyman stuf around the house because I take a while to do it and never work exactly at the times she wants me too. But I said to her cuz the guy was trying to gouge them for money that I would do most of the digging and work. He said he was going to come back on saturday to fix it after I got all the leg work out of the way. I thought all was fine and dandy, I was planning on working on it all day friday. Then my dad came and knocked on my door at ab
out 630pm saying he wantewd me to start on it. So I did and then it got too dark and I had to stop. Then my mom said another guy is supposed to come tomorrow to work on it and she cant depend on my because im too crazy and I never listen to whats going on. I had no idea they didnt tell me they were hiring two different guys. Then she said she was sick of me, im worthlessall i do is drink and sleep and to get out of her house.

176013164,What meds are you taking
176013165,Almost. About 90% of my psychosis. Get some thought insertion sometimes though and occasionally voices. Alien’s always there waiting to strike.
176013166,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ It was a long time coming, and unexpected I upset my family, but I will try and make it up to them if I can"
176013167,"I think you have a lot of delusions. Only that they exist in your mind as real. That is the trick: To doubt what is real. Philosophers and scientists do that all the time. Nobody knows the truth. Everyone believes in some truths, but they still doubt them nevertheless."
174345044,I don’t know if you can hide your schizophrenia from them and from your environment. I don’t know if its illegal.
176013168,"yea it originally 50 dollars, okay ill get it."
176013169,It’s because I had strong coffee. I think I associate that with tobacco
176013170,Yeah. You don’t have to worry about taking meds everyday. I have less side effects and my voices don’t get too out of hand.
176013171,"I just feel like, my language level at my job is very sub par to understand the terms they are using to properly execute tasks accordingly… and makes numerous mistakes and am a nuisance and a burden to the team. My past knowledge before psychosis has almost evaporated… it’s terrible. It’s a technical level, more than confidence level at this point to me… Never really quit a job like this before, so wanted to share with the forum and see what people experienced. Thanks for sharing guys… it’s really hard to remember things, but I think I’ll give it another day for I asked to do my shift with out anybody looking over the shoulders and doing tasks myself. If it goes south I will quit."
176013172,Do you have voices delusions excedra. Its supposed to help with that
176013173,"I think that maybe time may be subjective. I have experienced time slowing down, especially when I had a road traffic accident. And I can have a “long” dream in only a minute. I wonder therefore whether the last scene of the movie “American Beauty” in which the hero dies and then sees his life all at once, with no time, like spread out maybe, or on repeat (I have no idea) might be true. Someone in a play I once watched threw a ball into the air and caught it saying, “At the top of the arc the ball is stationary. Maybe time is like that.” Time only needs to stop once for there to be an eternity. If I can see my life in that moment and I have lived a good life, it will be a good eternity. But if I haven’t then, it will be a bad one."

176013179,My brother in law has diabetes for a long time he had very very high blood sugar and the insulin wasn’t enough. He started hearing voices. After getting put back on insulin he got better but still occassions hears voices

176013181,Glad to see!
176013182,It happened to me on Monday - I was terrified Alien would take my mind over
176013183,yeah I kinda am…im bitter a bit toward a couple of my friends 4 of them at least. I dont think they cared about me cuz when I got sick they ditched me. u know my friends now ive had tough times during our friendship but they’ve been there for me. maybe theyre just more understanding because they have mental illness too. but oh well that’s how I like my friends maybe. I just think I befriended a lot of the wrong people or they hurt me because they could or something. except a few just weren’t loyal but some really seriously harmed me.
176013184,"I think it is subjective, statistically Latuda’s efficiency is comparable to Risperidone."
176013185,You mean your meds are doing this? Its not possible because APs only work on central dopamine (Brain D2) receptors and not peripheral dopamine receptors (Spinal cord and peripheral nerves). Otherwise ppl on APs will die fast from heart problems.

176013191,"I would be careful about assuming that all grandiose delusions come from a place of insecurity. Some probably do, but others don’t. In my case, my grandiose delusions were a direct result of my arrogance. I’ve always sort of felt that I was intellectually superior and spiritually special. Many of my delusions played into that, be they grandiose or paranoid. “I’m the sacrifice, the antichrist, an angel, a demon, the protagonist of a story being told by God, a god (or the god) myself. Of course, many of my delusional ideas also centered around my anxieties, namely my fear that I’m a bad person, but of course, there can be other causes too."

176013199,"psychosis requires medical intervention, regardless of whether it’s trauma-induced or not. Once you’ve been symptom free for over a year, you can talk with your pdoc about whether you think your condition is permanent or transient. But until then, you need the meds. Psychosis causes measurable, physical brain damage. My recent MRI showed a significant loss of gray matter, which is a known side effect of psychosis. That was enough to convince me to stay on meds for life."

176013202,I took a med that killed my libido once. It was remeron or mirtazipine. Got off that stuff. Have mild dysfunction on Geodon but have viagara if I need it but usually don’t need it.
176013203,I’m restless and I shake my legs a lot. I’ve got to call my caseworker tomorrow. Not a useless thread. I’ve always been sensitive to side effects of atypical aps. Perphenazine is a darn typical one. Anyone have to have benztropine for side effects here?
176013204,Good luck with the cigarettes !

174345057,He was also able to not talk about them for avoiding hospitalizations and meds.
176013208,Do you think you could give it up or do you reckon you gonna be here forever?
176013209,I don’t have positive symptoms so doubt it
176013210,_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you’re experiencing this! It’s distressing! I used to. A lot. Latuda took it away.
176013211,I’m considering asking the dr to let me change to pills because I’ve been med compliant with the clozapine. The doc didn’t seem against it on the phone…
176013212,"Dont really feel much. No drooling, no sedation. Gotta talk to my pdoc about upping the dose"
176013213,i think it does damage the brain… maybe they can’t really see it on a scan but i think it does some damage over time.
174345069,"I didn’t acknowledge my diagnosis till I came to this forum. I then eventually understood that what I experienced was positive symptoms. I don’t have much social life as such and get it mostly from forum and family. I have been stable since I met my x in sa. I never used to tell my psychiatrist my symptoms because I was scared of what medication they would forse me to go on. In Sweden when I had voices, gunshots and mones 24/7 I lied to my dr and said I wasn’t hearing voices when she asked. I was scared what medication she could forse upon me or if she hospitalised me. I wasn’t coping. Somehow years later the voices stopped then delusions came instead. Been good lately. I don’t have friends as such not to socialise with as such anyway or even to chat with so it’s nice to come here for support and socialising etc I was under two other usernames but had a break from forum a while. I came back."

176013215,"I want to read _PERSON_ book “The Center Cannot Hold”, as research for a recovery book I want to write. But I am not in the right headspace for that yet. I don’t have the full picture of recovery, so it’s like I have incomplete information. Can’t write a book like that. But my gut says I’ll get it eventually. The impression I’m getting from the book summary is that you just need to force your will through the internal turmoil, get good meds, and just live with a broken mindset. It seems like too much work but it’s impressive as ???? when people do this. I just want to coast through life. Heal the damage and solve the crazy narrative, make things easy and free, mentally."

176013221,That’s good. Ask them specifically if they have experience helping people with psychosis
176013222,I think so. Pretty sure. It’s mostly fuzzy and I don’t even remember taking it. Nurse said I didn’t get it but then doctor said I did. It’s very confusing. I really don’t know or remember. I was severely paranoid and acutely psychotic at the time. I wanted it to study and go back to school. Not sure why she gave it to me. She said I got paranoid after I took it. I think I was so desperate to try it. I get these thoughts like it would be like ‘limitless’ lol or something. But it’s not true.

176013226,I think the voices went on and started messing with my phone when I was in the middle of calling my mom. I mean yes I know they were in a crisis because they started screaming and all but before they sounded kind of low toned and flaky almost as if they did not want me to know they were in this crisis. See they’ve done this before and I was caught a fool in the action of adhering their cry but that wasn’t the case I suppose.
176013227,"It’s weird to think that one human being is like the embodiment of all evil. Like God’s bad side manifest as a person.

174345070,Which drugs are in clinical phase 3? KarXT/Xanomeline only?

174345067,"most likely or a med adjustment. maybe turn off the tv and stuff for a bit and take a break? Always helps me. This is how I rationalized my experience: I remembered it in a dream from a past life via physics (QM). I remember some celebrities popping out of the tv while watching _NAME_ on TV. I suspect and believe (sometimes) that it was _NAME_ and others teleporting to my grandma’s house in a past life and trying to scare me unless I was psychotic and had missing time. Knowing the universe, I wouldn’t discount my experience and all the hell I’ve been through over many years and lifetimes. I guess schizophrenia + teleportation = madness. It’s not time travel. It’s teleportation, which technically isn’t available and doesn’t exist yet. I guess they timed it right and I had a mental illness too. I often think I can change reality and the future (“Adjustment Bureau” PKD). I figured I was _NAME_ in a past life and saved over 3 billion people. I can’t get a job or money but similar to 
the new Terminator movie I feel like “Is that enough of a resume for you”? I’m ?????? up and delusional. It’s all in another dimension or past life as far as I’m concerned.

176013251,"I think it’s terrible how a system based on self interest can make money off the winners of society and the losers. Every person in power filled with their own self interest and that of systems based on self interest have found ways to shape how we think; ie shallow and materialistic- talking about people in positions of power, socialites, people’s net worth, the clothes celebrities wear, a business that exploits people and says we’re here to help the poor, this all upsets me. No real problems are ever really solved they’re just monetized and sold to different groups. What’s the answer? More resilience. Basically deal with it and keep on keeping on within the system. People are conditioned from birth to live a superficial, materialistic life. It has gotten to the point where websites are created where you state your position and salary to acquire a mate. What’s the alternative? A life not about materialism is almost always religious of some kind. What’s their answer to materialism and 
shallowness? To some it’s all an illusion ( pretty much nihilism ), character and a better life outside of this life, or karma coming for you. So what sounds more satisfactory: keep on keeping on, everything stays the way it is, or total renunciation, or be a hypocrite and say you’re not concerned with material things yet you have all of capitalism’s trappings but you’re deeply religious. Even if you totally renunciate the whole system everyone around you will judge you based on a materialistic shallow conditioning always in the background. You could choose to live a life of poverty and deeper inner conscientiousness, but most people only rationalize things after the fact for example; someone by merit or luck becomes poor so now they rationalize I’ll now live a life of religious purpose and help others, the thought comes secondary. Not many people chose a life of poverty over wealth, it just happens then it becomes the new normal and a part of this new life is developing a life philosophy that coinc
ides with your new lifestyle. Someone who has a mortgage on their house, tell me are they concerned with how much money their mate makes or do they care how much money or hours they get at work? Of course they do. They’ve bitten into the forbidden fruit, they’re now indebted to materialism, so now they become cheerleaders for the system; their livelihood depends on it. So you live with cognitive dissonance and become a hypocrite the older you get because you become more dependent on the system especially once you owe student loans, a mortgage, a car note, medicines, and everything else. The carrot and the stick never changes throughout the centuries. You just become more of a hypocrite with ten tongues taking all sides in conversation hiding the real truth with a silent voice deep inside that never comes up to speak."
174345077,"I was “hospitalized” for 2 hours in the ER and I was given a typical drug (sorry but I forgot the name)that is not used now. It caused blind spells, sedated me throughout the day. It was prescribed by an ER doctor after I had gone through 3 days and nights of screaming at the voices hoping to make them stop talking. Shortly before I admitted to my parents I had voices in my head because I just about reached the end of my rope but they decided to go on with their vacation anyway. I called the ambulance while they were away because I had a rapid heartbeat that scared me. They didn’t follow up until months later after I failed at 2 jobs due to incompetence. Then I had my first doctor’s visit specifically for the schizophrenia. I used a smaller amount than prescribed so I could sleep at night and stay awake during the day when I experienced full blown psychosis. I was then put on haldol followed by risperdal with periods of trying other drugs since I was still hearing voices. I was not hospital
ized almost 2 decades after that due to side effects from a med. About 4-5 years later I had a relapse due to a second drug before I had to settle for risperdal/invega and got hospitalized 4 times."

Kicked out sugar and gluten first. I felt very sad, tired and with mild GI trouble after the bread…but im not sure if it was the food or my pms starting."

176013277,How can he say that. What does he know about how you are able to study or not. If you get good grades that should be a sign that you are on track. Doctors are only people. They need to be questioned.
176013278,I went to the hall yesterday and everyone was talking bad about me. I just dont understand how one person can be broadcasted over tv and over the country.

It helped me to come out in anonymous online spaces, and try out my new identity for a bit with no stakes. It felt very right, in an indescribable way. I knew, from the first time someone called me he, that this was what I wanted. Coming out was a very tricky personal decision. In the end, I only did it because Starlet came out to me, and I wanted to product test my family for homophobia before he came out to them and got maybe rejected. About 90% of them have disowned me, but the ones who were supportive have become even more important as a result."

As it is high side of normal I don’t have milk production in breasts (im male) but my sex drive is minimal, have severe erectile dysfunction, and perceive that my penis and testicles have shrunk. Of all the antipsychotics I’ve taken I think the one that doesn’t affect prolactin is Olanzapine.

Apparently I think she was in my medicinecabinet and saw what meds I was on and googled them, and then dropped me, because I noticed she was in my bathroom a long time when it sounded nothing was happening, and I think that was our last date too. We had been on a few dates but I hadn’t found the right moment to get into that yet. And the kicker is she told me that she had been in some other guys cabinet in the bathroom and seen he was on some kind of psych drug and then dropped him. So I suspect the same thing happend to me. No big deal, I don’t think she was the one for me anyways, but I was wondering if this is something to be expected. I don’t see myself doing something like that to others, unless it was by accident. Anyone had experiences?"

Maybe you feel it makes you a bad or stupid person, or maybe you feel you’d admit defeat by admitting they were right. But you need to let all that crap go. The psychs know way more about that stuff than you, and if they say you have delusions and psychotic symptoms, then that’s most likely what you have. If you fell and cut your leg, went to the er for a checkup, and were told “that’s bleeding, you’ll need stitches” would you tell the doctor he was wrong and try to fight him on it? Or would you accept he had more medical training than you and knew what he was doing?"

And avoid sausage, and hamburger meat as it’s very fatty. And processed meats even worse. Preferably a semi vegetarian diet. Semi vegan - even better! But if you want animal protein fish is best, and yogurts. Also - eat in moderation, not till you over satiated (I’m talking to myself first lol! ) And avoid processed food and junk food as much as possible. My weakness is corn chips so what I do is buy one medium packet a week instead of ten small packets and if I finish it in first two days then I go without for next five.

174345095,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The mediating role of cognition and social cognition on creativity among patients with schizophrenia and healthy control: revisiting the Shared Vulnerability Model. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences , Nov 2019 09 As suggested by the Shared Vulnerability Model, impairment in executive functions could lead to worse creative performance among individuals with schizophrenia. Another impaired function in schizophrenia, previously related to creativity in healthy people, is theory of mind. However, little is known about the effect of theory of mind in creativity in schizophrenia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze differences in creativity among patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls and to explore the potential role of executive functions and theory of mind as mediators of this relationship.Forty-five patients with schizophrenia and 45 healthy controls underwent a neur
opsychological assessment including executive functions (cognitive flexibility and working memory), theory of mind, and verbal and figural creativity.As expected, patients with schizophrenia obtained lower scores in creativity, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and theory of mind compared to healthy controls. Path analysis showed that theory of mind mediated the relationship between group (schizophrenia or healthy controls) and both figural (Z=2.075, p=.037) and verbal creativity (Z=2.570, p=.010). Working memory mediated the relationship between group and figural creativity (Z=2.034, p=.041) and was marginally significant for verbal creativity (Z=1.930, p=.053). Finally, cognitive flexibility mediated between group and figural creativity (Z=2.454, p=.014).Results suggest that the lower performance in creativity among patients with schizophrenia was partly due to an impairment in executive functions and theory of mind. The involvement of theory of mind opens up a new field of research as a possible risk 
factor in the Shared Vulnerability Model. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

I signed the book on behalf of me and another young man who I had gotten into the incident with. I donated it to the Salvation Army. I felt that the whole world was watching me and that booklet would be worth millions of dollars when the story was finally told…and that millions of poor people would be fed and clothed. That finally something good would come out of a tragic event.

I have about 6 friends and I am almost always willing to talk with them for 5-20 minutes on the phone. I feel bad because I feel less interested sometimes like when they are lonely. But they are really not bad and they do not overdue their welcome. I don’t have many activities at this time. I shop for presents, I go out to eat with friends, I read many emails and read the links every day. I attend a mental health drop-in center every Saturday. I like to cook.

174345123,"Just yesterday in Women’s support group they mentioned that I seemed genuinely happy going to Women’s Group regardless of how well I was doing. At my worst, I felt I was better off dead because of negative symptoms but I knew I had to get up and keep going because life isn’t kind to those who give up. I had no friends, was overweight, and could barely hold a conversation with my parents. First thing that helped me was going out to drink bubble tea once in a while. It felt good seeing faces not belonging to my parents, the long bus ride was restful, and somehow the caffeine in bubble tea gave me a buzz for a few hours. I read books I could barely understand to exercise my mind. There were also things like sitting in the _USER_ID_ at a waterfront park a month later and suddenly feeling that there was hope. Traditions like my parents taking me out for a long drive on New Year’s Day and making a big dinner made me feel better. Sometimes nothing helped but eating comfort food, which was still en
joyable. Going to _USER_ID_ helped a lot. Somehow the sadness of loosing everything and then finding peers hit me in a big way. Plus they had good strawberry dip. It made me want to find a life and share it with my peers. Next thing that helped me was getting a therapist who supported me. She encouraged me to look for simple work. I went to a job fair 4 months post stabilizing and found a job doing data entry at the bank. Coming on here helped a lot too as I began to trust the feedback I get on this website. Seeing friends on Facebook helped too because it showed me what adulting is like. Long story short after 1 month of working at the bank my anhedonia and much of my negative symptoms mysteriously went away. I quit working due to stress, started day treatment and support group, met great friends, and I was overjoyed and grateful. But that’s not to say someone with heavy negatives can’t find hope and meaning. It’s possible to find different kinds of happiness despite anhedonia. There are some long term 
sources of happiness that don’t require an injection of dopamine for example. What are some things that keep you going?"

They tried to stop me seeing my son as they said I was dangerous. All they do is lie. They keep on trying to get me to kill myself and have taken over alot of the things around me.

For four years my counselor and psychiatrist have spoken directly with me. If he has any conversations about me (with family, doctors, or hospitals), he tells me their content in full. The IOP therapists thinks it exacerbates my ocd symptoms if they talk with me. But at $880 each week out-of-pocket, I think they can handle an email every now and then!"

176013485,"Crack was big in the news in the 1980’s. They called it an epidemic, it was destroying whole communities and contributing to major crime. Back then, probably one thing that anyone who watched news regularly knew about it was that it was highly addictive. I’ve lived with several young women at one time or another who had bulimia and anorexia and binged and purged. I saw how destructive it was, one poor alcoholic women who moved into our group home had such a bad case that they asked her to leave a week after she moved in and two weeks later the counselors passed around a clipping from a newspaper that announced she died. But yeah, I’ve seen young women fight it, I saw how tough it was. Maybe it’s apples and oranges but I might prefer fighting a crack addiction to fighting an eating disorder. At least with crack, I came out of the addiction physically unscathed."

176013522,"Really sorry to hear so many of us have voices that only do us harm. It really makes me wonder what about a person dictates what kind of things they hear. I had my therapist suggest to me that maybe my male voice was such a jerk because my dad isn’t very nice to me. Whatever the reason is, I hope those of you who replied saying your voices are only cruel can one day get to a point where that isn’t the case, or ideally, maybe get to a point where they don’t bother you. I wish the best for you all. You’re all amazing."

176013533,My new therapist is under the impression that I dont have sza. He brought I could possibly have dissociated identity disorder. Not so much the different personalities but because the voices persist
176013534,"An antipsychotic is what you need for the delusions. I started experiencing delusions in 2014, and kept trying different medicines over many months. I eventually landed on Zyprexa which helped me greatly. I no longer have delusions, though I still hallucinate voices (usually I just ignore them). No matter how scary this feels, just remember that the majority of people who experience this see some improvement over the years that follow. Get a good psychiatrist and start trying antipsychotics. You mentioned Latuda, which I don’t believe is an antipsychotic. I understand you about the hospitalizations. They can be scary and really all they do is allow a doctor to issue you new medication faster than normal. If you work with your psychiatrist and are proactive about trying medicines, you should be able to avoid hospitalization in most cases. Hang in there, try to use your support network (family, close friends) and get on an antipsychotic. Best of luck!"

Simple visuals, walls moving, breathing: I like to touch the wall, if I can feel it solid under my hand it reaffirms that it’s not moving. Complex visuals, angels, shadow people, ghosts: I like to take a picture of them, they won’t show on the picture. First tried this when I was seeing bunnies everywhere, found it helps. Simple auditory, whispers and sounds: when completely alone it’s easier to reality check, than out in a crowd. I try to find the quietest place in my house, normally my bedroom, and play soft music. If the music drowns them out I’m able to rationalize its me. Complex auditory, angels, full sentences, full phrases, clear: these are harder as they normally come on when my insight is faltering, Put thoughts in my head. I analyze the voice, do my best to move past it, distrac
tions help. For this level I recommend getting someone to soundboard the thoughts off of. Someone you trust that you can count on. Those are some steps I can take before I get to far gone and believe the hallucinations and thoughts. I’m hoping they can help someone else before the illness confuses us to what’s real."

176013543,"Way to go. Helping someone else is one of the most rewarding things you can do. I felt really good when I used to drive my sisters or my dad to the airport when they were flying somewhere on vacation and then pick them up when they returned. I used to housesit a lot too and take care of their pets and water their inside or outside plants when they were gone. I don’t do as much as I used to but I still help out occasionally. Being a little scared helps, lol. It sharpens your wits and makes you a little more alive and alert. “Courage is not the absence of fear, true courage is being afraid of something and doing it anyways.”"
176013544,Me too. I’m honestly so petrified.

I know this is a delusion of grandeur and also something that is not always appropriate. Fire is cleansing and it is wrong to stop the cleansing of individuals who are dead whilst cleansing the living of their personalities. It is actually very barbaric. I’m still not against smoking, just want to only do it when it’s appropriate, whatever that means. My smoking is coming under control, I am doing much better, but I still reach for it when I’m angry or want to show resistance, whilst at the same time, indulging in it when I think people are taking the piss with me.

176013577,"Both IMHO. I had haldol for a couple of weeks before it gave me TD, and it made me ravenous. I haven’t felt such a hunger n my life on any other med especially, so aps can make you eat more. I don’t eat a lot at the moment and even did a 1200 calorie diet for a month and stayed the same weight, so that is the aps affecting my metabolism. The fact is if you are on aps then you have to watch what you eat. It is the equivalent on being on a diet all the time. That means no pizza ever for me for example. I maintain weight on a 1600 calorie a day diet. That is not a lot for a male. Any more than that and I gain, unless I cardio excessively."

Mine say they torture just for fun and that I deserve it cuz they warned me not to smoke and I did. They even took the nicotine away but gave me a monstrous urge to smoke with thoughts that it was to late so I said to my self I might as well smoke they never gave me good reasons for my torture. It also weird how similar are voices are with aliens and torture keep me posted on how your doing I really hope your voices go away?

My dentist has his own small practice and he has new equipment that has just come out. Those are measurable examples of things getting better. There were probably people in the 1950’s who thought nothing gets better. There were people back then who just thought having schizophrenia meant either staying in institutions for the rest of your life or having your family stick you in a back bedroom and take care of you for the rest of your life without you ever leaving the house. Then in the 1950’s it was discovered that certain drugs could help schizophrenics recover enough to live outside the hospitals. No one could have predicted that. That was a huge change. Even in our time, the second generation drugs were developed. Two important discoveries that changed schizophrenics prognosis for the better. Hell, in my own case I was so sick in the beginning of my disease I n
ever even dreamed I would ever get better, let alone work or go to school again. But here it is 40 years later and I’m looking back on being almost steadily employed since 1983. I have a nice car and a few other amenities. Things got better."

The burning sensation will overpower everything and make you forget that you want to self-harm. Try to go as long as possible without water or milk afterwards, to make the sensation last. If you self harm in a specific pattern, apply lotion in that pattern and rub it in slowly. It helps me feel like something is happening where I want it to happen, but without getting scars. And also, remember that it’s a temporary solution to a long-lasting problem. It won’t make you feel better in the long run, and it won’t fix your problems."

It doesnt matter how upset I am I still have residents counting on me I have people that I need to take care of so everything gets pushed down. By the time I get home I dont have the energy to do anything or deal with emotions. I have a bad habit of just pushing it down. I know I shouldn’t. I’m trying to work on it. I do listen to music a lot but I cant do that at work. I have started carrying altoids in my pocket though they help sometimes. I’m gonna get a different job once school starts.

176013608,I still haven’t sent the letter to Social Security to stop my benefits yet. I am in my second week at my new job and it is really challenging. I have been thinking about quitting and giving up and just staying on benefits but I think I am going to send the letter tomorrow and I have 3 pay stubs now. I have been working full time for a total of 6 weeks now. I thought getting up at 630 every morning was going to kill me but I have handled it. This new job I have a year of being shadowed by an on the job instructor before they will let me go out on my own. I have been told it takes two years to learn this job. That’s a lot of work and I already have a lot of education and experience but this job is brand new and I am lost right now. But after the first year of probation if I am successful I can go out on my own and get promoted two paygrades and can then telework from my house. I will only have to go to the office like once a week to check mail. I don’t know if I have the self discipline for that
. I work right by the Social Security Office so at lunch I am going to go try and drop off my letter. If no one will take it and they want me to wait in line I will just put in in the mail tomorrow I have decided I am going to do this but if a job in my field of expertise which is aviation comes up I might jump ship.

176013627,Same with me…
176013628,Last stay - May 1981-March 1983.
176013629,"Christmas Eve at my parents making tamales, kugel, ham with scalloped potatoes and melted cheese. Lots of sweets too! We don’t practice Hanukkah anymore, since my grandma died. We may this year if my mom’s healthy. We’ve gotten lazy about it. Then, Christmas day we’ll be at my in laws all day. We eat more ham, mashed potatoes, deviled eggs, rolls, marshmallow fruit salad. So many drinks and merrying about. Ahhh… I can’t wait!"
176013630,The condition is fluctuating. I didn’t leave my house for about a year because I thought that people in the school next door to me were spying on me and testing microwave weapons on me. When I relapse this gets bad and I can’t go out unless my partner comes with me. I also have social anxiety. I’ve been doing a lot better over the last couple of years and started a part time job (which is going badly) a couple of months ago so I don’t think I’ll get the mobility component when I have to apply again. It sounds to me as though you have a good chance of getting high rate mobility.
176013631,I think it was prolacting causing my third person hallucinations. Dropped off all supplements increasing prolacting and I’m using zinc as prolacting inhibitor now. Also eating bananas for b6 and maybe add E vitamin to decrease prolacting
176013632,"when i went to visit canada with a friend from south korea we had to take a stop in the USA and when we came there they thought we were korean spies, they interrogated us for hours and eventually put us on an airplane to canada but they took our passports and we were guided there and when arriving in canada immediately more interrogations…"
176013634,"There is absolutely no god causing this. It is very sad when people believe in such things. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, it is just a random event. Anyone can get the illness, including religious people. Keep up the yoga and meditation."
176013635,I had really bad stomach problems and so does my mom. I still do probably from energy drinks. I have diarrhea and stuff a lot.
176013636,"no, never 151515"
176013637,Awwwww…you are the best. _AT_MENTION_ I have so many supportive people here. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ the list is long. Even a hug to _AT_MENTION_ despite our disagreements. You are all good people.
176013638,"Usually I take my morning risperdal 2mg at 11am, today I took it at around 2pm as I was already starting to feel tense, angry and suspicious of others. Now I calmed down as I took the pill."
174345172,So you don’t get delusions directly from the illness either. It just based on the circumstances of what you are hearing that can make you delusional. It’s not like the illness itself just caused you to out of the blue have delusions from your D2 receptors. The voices are saying crazy stuff and that makes you have a false belief. I don’t get delusions from what they are saying because I think the voices are liars. I used to believe them when they said they were going to kill me and my family but after they threatened that a million times with no results I determined they were bluffing.
176013639,Its real interesting. I’m learning stuff as I go along. I got just as much socks as anything else. I guess I’m being foxyproxy after all with my money. It must be funny for ‘him’ to watch me and see a simple mom go through the same steps and go further than him the past baseball club head.

176013649,"Risperdal kicked my butt, though I was able to keep on working. I compensated with caffeine. Dr. tried prescribing stimulants, but they made me way too tense. Eventually I had him drop the Risperdal to 1mg/day. Doing OK so far."

I see men in their cars trying to stalk me and men follow me when I walk around so now I avoid going outside. I’m fairly certain I have a chip in my wrist, that’s why the perverts that want to get me know when i’m coming. but i don’t know what’s real. when i went to hospital i saw the nurse write delusional thoughts on her notes"
174345184,Wouldnt surprise me if it does
176013656,Exercise has been very good for me. I’m older and that could be a reason too but I went from sleeping 10 hours a day to 8 or less simply adding exercise. I’m reading books regularly. I still have a bit of paranoia or intrusive thoughts but on the whole it’s been very beneficial. I’ve even halved my antidepressant. Only change was exercise so I think your onto a good thing here. It does get easier and routine is great for the sz.

176013665,Yes i asked and they did that
176013666,I usually don’t think about much unless i have pressing things to do in the near future then stuff pops up
176013667,I’m glad you’re feeling better. I really like that composition. It would be a good music soundtrack for an action film scene where the hero is determined to conquer an obstacle and then ultimately succeeds.

176013670,"long time ago I was first on geodon then I was put on abilify. I didn’t want to take it because I started getting what I was calling bad thoughts, and of course the doctor just basically told me to suck it up if he even acknowledged it was there. So I stopped for a year… ended up in the hospital. when I got out didn’t stop taking the medication again."
176013671,"No, because I have these symptoms since 2014, and was only just introduced to these meds recently."

176013673,"That’s just not true, _NAME_. Women over 35 don’t all of a sudden drop all their standards and values to hook up with anyone for a baby. That’s asinine. Sure, women feel the urge to have a baby now and again, But that doesn’t mean they just want to ???? any idiot off the street for it. Dear lord."
176013674,"I’m wondering if I’ve been suffering from capgras again in the matrix, it doesn’t really matter, life is what you want it to be, but you cannot get free, if you respect authority then it respects you, but you have a right to argue your case."

176013677,"Chances are that if I took APs I’d worry a great less deal about what it means to exist, to be human, and to be conscious. It doesn’t follow though that the “absence of APs” is the root cause of my existential dread. Given this sorry state of affairs and the magnitude of our collective tragedy, I don’t see what’s so odd about believing that there only one person exist that the universe is a simulation generated by the demiurge. It would be a real kindness if someone could refute this view."
174345187,"Also there’s another med called Paliperidone. It’s the metabolite of risperidone. Very similar, but it could make a difference. Idk if Paliperidone comes in tablets though. Only ever seen the depot."

The specialty of DMG is its not like a stimulant so its hard to notice a quick effect but its working in the background. You can feel more energy, less drowsiness, less anxiety, less depression etc."
176013682,"There’s a difference between being called a god, feeling like a god, and acting like a god. I mean notice the ‘a’. I believe in the big G, but I don’t claim to know anything about it or how it works. I thought at one point it was a computer (quantum AI) or evn just quantum phyiscs/mind. But there are some people who think deeply about the ‘Godmind’. There are advanced races (from my perspective) that act and have god-like powers. Notice the ‘god-like’ phrase. It’s definitely possible to build a simulation. It’s not impossible. Same thing with inception. It’s pretty naive to think we are the most advanced species or only species in the universe. I find it funny. In the end, we’ll see who is right. I expect I’ll be recognized some day and probably have my own wikipedia page lol."

174345196,Less than 1% of the general population of any country is schizophrenic. Capitalism and earning some sort of income allows the citizens of a certain country to survive. Society accepts that we schizophrenics live off the government system of disability benefits. Philanthropy is a privilege only for the wealthy which we schizophrenics are not. If you want to gain a competitive edge than find a job that pays more than what you are receiving from the government and more than what working at minimum wage would pay. That will help your wallet out.

176013690,"Somehow support groups are manageable but adding day treatment just 3 hours per day 3 days per week leaves me exhausted the entire week. I guess with support group you can rest in between. I’m not extremely low energy, somehow just low functioning enough to make tutoring hard. I am taking 1 peer coaching client and if that goes well they might give me a second client. But I’ve tried tutoring when I was higher functioning. It’s a fun job but just being present for a 6 hour school day will probably take me a week to recover."
176013691,Love and good wishes from me too. I think it’s good that you asked for help. Think how lovely when you are through this and you might feel more light and free.

176013702,Lately I’ve noticed that some really insulting thoughts I had about others were completely ignored in reality when I kept them to myself. Oh sure I hear their voice reply when I do it in my head. But for some reason what I hear in reality indicates that it doesn’t affect them. Of course things said out loud are different as they should be. It took 27 years to reach that realization.

176013721,Coffee and cigarettes my friend. Nothing beats the basics.
176013722,Some may relate to this. I bought microwaveable little potatoes and microwaveable veg to go with some chicken . The potatoes needed 8 minutes and the veg about 5.5 minutes. I put the potatoes in the m/wave first for several minutes in a bowl and then added the veg. They should be m/waved separately but I didn’t know how to coordinate that without the potato or veg getting cold hence why it went together in a bowl. I couldn’t properly judge how long to cook the combined potato and veg . The potato and veg were both quite hard despite getting up and m/waving them again after I’d put them on the plate and sat down to eat . In future I’ll be getting potatoes that go in the oven .

176013745,"This is because there is a LOT of trauma in the world and no understanding of what ‘healing’ is or looks like. If we’ve been hurt by something we will do whatever we can to avoid it or feel forever victimized by it in our minds. Naturally a lot of response out there to these kind of traumas is to ‘silence’ people and ‘protect’ people who are hurt. Problem is, it perpetuates the problem while demonizing someone else. I’ve personally been hurt deeply by some words that I won’t say, but never have I thought the solution is to demonize someone else or shut someone else up. Actually, when I do start to feel that way? I find it hurts me more than moving in the direction of what healing is. Really, does it help me to get angry and want someone to be imprisoned/silenced/branded as ‘bad’? Is THAT at the core of what a person wants who’s been hurt by something? And what is healing? To think/feel/experience the opposite. By doing that no one gets hurt and a person who is hurt starts to 
find relief from that pain. If my generation on the whole understood this, they would stop trying to demonize and damn everyone that disagrees with them. THAT is what ‘justice’ really is. There is no ‘justice’ in harming something and not returning someone who was hurt to a state where they’re not hurting. The only ‘feel good’ that people get is through their ego in that way… By seeing someone else as ‘bad’ we can see ourselves as ‘good’… It’s pretty heinous at its core. Every time I see someone perpetuate these kind of cycles I get seriously annoyed. Its like: “Oh you poor thing!”. Okay, it’s understandable to feel that way. But is it actually beneficial and does it feel good or does it cement the condition as unpleasant even more? In other words, is healing and therefore feeling good/relief wanted? Or to be coddled to death and continuing to feel bad about something? I’m sure you understand this better than most here… You actually want people to feel good which is a goo
d thing. It’s not ‘indifference’ or ‘immature’ as most would see it. It’s actually healthier and saner to want others to feel good. And in response to the OP: there IS something wrong and this is a part of what is the problem. If everyone out there is fighting and demonizing stuff and not internally feeling good/finding relief… then what does the world really look like? A desert. An emotionless desert."

176013751,"Yes, synthetic and lab grown meat will soon be available. Pesticides on the crops though kill trillions of insects still if we continue to eat it. Have you seen ‘what we do in the shadows’ where there is a vampire who hilariously feeds on negative emotions rather than blood. Even if humans become guardians of the food chain, all the animals that reside in this universe still live in constant fear of predation, and or hunger. Without elaborating on my spiritual beliefs, I am not saying that we don’t deserve to live in this ‘hell’ through actions in previous lives, but still the whole system is morally bankrupt when you can’t escape it and it remains in predation and exploitation. Even vegans don’t know they are killing trillions of insects and millions of animals even though they are not directly eating them."

176013761,"_AT_MENTION_ That must be really difficult with APs and hypothyroidism. I lost a stone earlier this year and put it on again, but gaining it back coincided with an increase in my sertraline so maybe that has something to do with it? _AT_MENTION_ Yeah, it’s going to be hard if your mum is always offering you sweet stuff. You’ll just have to get really good at saying no. I don’t think the UK is much better for mental illness than the States. I don’t think that there is as much homophobia in the UK though. People are pretty racist where I live. I’m out in the countryside and we don’t get many foreign folk round here. Anyone not from the immediate area is known as an outsider!"

It is not a time for the crass individualism of neoliberalism or for nationalistic populism . It’s a time when individuals and nations should do their best to help and support each other. When those less vulnerable should behave in ways that lower the risk to those who are most vulnerable .
176013771,I just don’t want people talking sh** about me when I’m gone.

It made sense when I heard this explanation and I think we need better systems to move forward. In a world like out here where there’s less full time work we need decent alternatives.
176013794,Heya. I’m mostly okay…

176013816,"Walking isn’t going to help you much if you want to lose weight. That’s for people with heart problems, the elderly and people who are so obese they find even walking very short distances to be completely exhausting. You need to do more intense workouts than that. Remember, it’s not really about how many calories you burn. When you start doing more intense workouts, your body will regulate your hunger so that you lose more weight. It’s also better for your heart."

176013820,"Hello _NAME_, It’s a probability, yes. I was watching videos tonight. I can say it also avoid thinking about whatever. I know that the internet makes people addicted. I do not know much about addiction, but I know that it is somewhere an escape from reality. I also run away from the news, from anything that reminds me the world as it is. Even when I was practicing music last weeks, I think I was running away from reality by living at night and eating at any time. Have a good night."

176013836,"I’ve had several experiences being in psych wards and mental health facilities, both inpatient and outpatient. There is good and bad about it. The good is they had classes and group sessions where they teach you coping skills like meditation and stuff about psychology. The bad is it can be boring as hell when your locked up on the psych ward for weeks on end, there isn’t much to do. Finding the right medication can be tricky, sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t, so you may have to try several meds over the period of months before you find something that works. You also need to deal with side effects of the meds, I got fat and developed diabetes…but I am stable now so it was a trade off I had to make."

Because I feel like every minute I am on disability is another minute my dad has to send me to a shitty nursing home where there’s drugs and shitty staff who yell at you all day.

174345236,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Favorable effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in attentional control and conversion rate to psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropharmacology, Feb 2020 10 Omega-3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids were suggested against cognitive dysfunctions and conversion to psychosis. However, a recent multicenter trial found no effect in reducing conversion rates in individuals at risk of developing schizophrenia. Patients' genetic heterogeneity and the timing of treatment might influence omega-3 efficacy. Here, we addressed the impact of omega-3 early treatment in both mice and human subjects with a 22q11.2 genetic hemi-deletion (22q11DS), characterized by cognitive dysfunctions and high penetrance of schizophrenia. We first tested the behavioural and cognitive consequences of adolescent exposure to normal or omega-3-enriched diets in wild-type and 22q11DS (LgDel/+) mice. 
We then contrasted mouse data with those gathered from sixty-two patients with 22q11DS exposed to a normal diet or supplemented with omega-3 during pre-adolescence/adolescence. Adolescent omega-3 exposure had no effects in wild-type mice. However, this treatment ameliorated distractibility deficits revealed in LgDel/+ mice by the Five Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5CSRTT). The omega-3 improvement in LgDel/+ mice was selective, as no other generalized cognitive and non-cognitive effects were evident. Similarly, omega-3-exposed 22q11DS patients showed long-lasting improvements on distractibility as revealed by the continuous performance test (CPT). Moreover, omega-3-exposed 22q11DS patients showed less risk of developing an Ultra High Risk status and lower conversion rate to psychosis. Our convergent mouse-human findings represent a first analysis on the effects of omega-3 early treatment in 22q11DS. The beneficial effects in attentional control and transition to psychosis could support the early use of ome
ga-3 supplementation in the 22q11DS population."

176013926,"I started to attend a lot of support groups – _USER_ID_, DBSA, Hearing Voices Network, and visited _USER_ID_ to try to get connected with a friend (that never panned out). I visited a place called Camp Wellness to be involved in the community and also Hope, a day program. Camp Wellness resulted in connecting me with a psychologist with a SMI diagnosis; this helped me see a future for my career. The day program freaked me out because everyone was so low functioning. I only went a couple of times. I kept at DBSA but the other support groups I stopped attending. I made a lot of friends in DBSA. I also called the warm line occasionally when I was feeling excruciatingly lonely. I used the crisis line at times too. I applied for jobs as a peer support and started shortly after in a shelter. I then moved from an on-call position to a full time position. After nine months, I found a job as a clinician again and have been working there for 7 months now. I apologized to a lot of friends about what I said/d
id during my psychosis. And started spending time with them as they were available. I developed friendships with previously mostly acquaintances and started to meet up with them regularly. I went to the local library at got free tickets to theater events and would attend with my mother or sister or a friend or by myself. I also got tickets to go to museums. I tried out yoga a couple of times but have yet to go regularly again. While psychotic, I was volunteering at a local pet shelter. I tried going once post-psychosis/diagnosis but did not really want to go back after that. I did do some physical therapy until my state insurance ran out. I contacted both schools that I had been enrolled in to see if I could continue. I started with one school (to learn to be a coder) and was put on hold for my doctoral program until later (so I could recover). I also gained my peer specialist certificate. I applied for my therapist license that had been revoked and went to the slow process of gaining it back. I started up my 
doctorate again, re-vamping my dissertation, and applied for an internship. I gradually developed a schedule for exercise that is run on Monday, bike on Tuesday with friends, and play indoor soccer on Saturday. I’m trying to add to that. Just recently I joined a couple of forums to chat about mental health and am trying online dating. I’m not sure how everything is going to go when I have to move for my internship in the fall and feel very nervous about it"
174345251,"Personally, I went through a phase believing I was the antichrist. I met two other people in the psych ward with the same beliefs. It is usually an emotional reaction to how you feel about yourself, and the world. Once I met other people with the same thing, I was like “Well, it can’t be ALL of us, I’d rather not be anyway.” The issue is feeling condemned, or believing that you now have to do evil to prove yourself, or get powers. The other two people were obsessed with getting powers. When they said that they have powers, I was like, cool, show me. They couldn’t. One of the guys ended up being my roomate when we left the psych ward, and he worshipped satan for a long time. Loved to give people drugs, f/ck with people, use people, cheat on his girlfriends. He saw all of this as part of his evil duties. Then he got married, and his wife cheated on him, he got remarried, and that one cheated on him. He just kept f/cking people over until eventually one of his suicide attempts gave him an ac
tual experience with God. That’s when he realized, he was just being a douche for the sake of his own self worship. Now, he’s reading Hebrew and preaching the gospel. Still crazy as sh/t, and treats everyone like he’s better then them, but, he wasn’t diagnosed with schizophrenia, he was diagnosed with bipolar, so I guess that they go through very similar stuff. He also, since a child, kind of loved satan, saw him as the underdog, and religion as control. Just some things to think about I guess. He literally joined the Navy, JUST to get a chance to break the last commandment on his list “Thou shalt not murder”. That’s how f/cked people get. He called me on the phone one night after catching his girlfriend cheating, and I had to talk him out of sacrificing them for their “injustices against him”. Satanism is all self worship/ self focus. I wish more people actually opened up about these things, cuz dude ended up strangling his girlfriend’s cat to death, and relishing in it, I had no doubt th
at he would have killed out of pure emotion."

Too often mental health teams look for trouble when there isn’t any. I was then (after being taken off 15mg) put on Abilify and then I suffered a relapse.

I feel like my doctor should have warned me but I guess she didn’t know. It definitely was helpful as an antipsychotic though.

176013942,No not now I don’t miss it but when I’m feeling extra fragile and when I feel like I’m not coping then I feel that it could help in a way. There is not that much freedom and some other patients can be aggressive. I was afraid. The food was good and they had some nice activities but only two or three times a week so the rest of the time was no activity except when I was in Sweden they let me go out with _PERSON_ and he took me bike riding. Not much exercise at the hospitals I’ve been to. The hospitals did have some thoughtfulness put into them which I appreciate. Most of the time is spent waiting to eat and revolving around food. Not much tv watching since the tv is shared and no Netflix or DVD. No phones no coffee Last hospital I was in they let me crewchette but I had to ask permission and they locked my stuff up when I wasn’t using it. I am coping and doing well now so I definitely do not want to go to hospital but when I am feeling fragile and that im not coping I feel I might need that 
extra support and help. I thought I needed assisted living once but thankfully I don’t. I get enough support from my family. I met my x boyfriend _PERSON_ in psych hospital and we are still friends. I wore a stripper nurse outfit in the psych ward under my dressing gown ha ha ha and surprised _PERSON_ in his room on his birthday . I showed him the stripper nurse outfit then I ran out of his room. We never had sex in hospital but I did wear that outfit that I had from when I was a stripper. I think there was some nice people in hospital but some people tried bossing about in bad way. _PERSON_ is the only friend I have from psych hospital but I did talk to some nice people. One girl threw a glass of water in my face for sitting on “her seat”.

176013996,"Actually sex in general already is antagonized and has a lot of _USER_ID_ against it. In many countries people are killed for having sex outside of marriage for example. Also, rape and the kind of violence you are talking about is already extremely frowned upon. There are not strict enough sentences out there I feel for it though. I do not think having anti-sex laws or anything would help at all with the sexual assault problem. Look at those countries and cultures in which sex is frowned upon outside of marriage and outside of reproductive reasons and you will see that the prevalence of sexual assault is, for whatever reason, much higher. Sex needs to be de-stigmatized. It is natural and a necessary part of life for life to continue. Sex education is what is very important. If we want to reduce sexual assault rates we need more sex _NAME_. Teaching about consent and what it looks like. For people who have urges to sexually assault others, destigmatizing that and seeing it as a disorder that they ne
ed help with and getting them the resources they need to never act on those urges. For those that have committed assaults we need better ways to prevent them from occurring again. 5 years of jail time does nothing. They need therapy, education about what sexual assault does to victims (literally some rapists just don’t see rape as harmful and don’t get why it’s bad if they are not causing physical harm to the person) and about consent, and they need to be separated from society while all this takes place. If castration, either chemical or physical needs to take place, then so be it. If all attempts at rehabilitation fail, they need to be locked up for life same way a murderer would. Because they are destroying lives. I had the chance to talk to a serial child rapist online a while back and it was a really eye opening experience. Growing up he assaulted a number of children. Since he took care never to “harm” them, he did not see what he was doing as wrong. He ended up going through a rehabilitation 
program where survivors shared their experiences and it changed him entirely. He was shocked at the lasting impact sexual assault had and was filled with remorse. He was also put on medication that tanked his sex drive. He had not committed any further assaults in over a decade when I had talked to him and never wanted to again."

176014006,The reason pills are put in blister packaging is to protect them by having each pill in its own pocket in the blister pack. Incidental minor mishaps like stepping on the blister pack or touching the blister pack with damp hands shouldn’t be an issue. Try to stop worrying about this – it’s really not something to be concerned about. Perhaps try to distract yourself from worrying about your pill blister packs by occupying your time doing something relaxing that you enjoy.

They try to trick you every step of the way as well, so much so that it feels like someone is intentionally fuucken with you. But I think it’s this other personality living in your mind (sz) which itself thinks it’s real and will try to do everything under the sun to convince you it’s real.

176014062,"en.m.wikipedia.org Wanderlust Wanderlust is a strong desire to wander or travel and explore the world. The first documented use of the term in English occurred in 1902 as a reflection of what was then seen as a characteristically German predilection for wandering that may be traced back to German Romanticism and the German system of apprenticeship (the journeyman), as well as the adolescent custom of the ""Wanderbird"" seeking unity with nature. The term originates from the German words wandern ('to hike') and Lust ('desire'..."

176014089,"While I’ve always denied that I ever hallucinated, I’ve been having strange dreams or possibly hallucinations while sleeping that I’ve been getting tons of phone calls. This started a few weeks ago. I sometimes thought it was real. Not sure anymore. It seemed realistic. Not sure now. It seemed to have stopped. It was terrifying! I don’t want to get too involved right now or discuss everything. I have strange beliefs and thoughts all the time haha. I’ve been having strange delusional dreams that were realistic. I guess lucid or even like sleep walking? It’s all controversial, I guess. I rather not talk about it too much. There is no evidence, no call logs, nothing. All my photos were deleted though off my phone, but I think I did that in my sleep or another time, but it’s all foggy and I can barely remember. Maybe I got lazy or something because I lost some good notes / passwords on my phone. I also have religious delusions and beliefs but I cannot really talk about them here due to th
e forum rules. One of my biggest concerns is Biblical prophecies, end times, Anti-Christ, fallen angels, and the Devil. I got over my Anti-Christ delusion because I was born in USA and I’m pretty sure the _PERSON_ comes from Europe or the EU. Furthermore, a lot of schizophrenics have similar delusions as I! Last, I guess it has to due with my severe paranoia that started in 2015 (and has since been resolved) and something to do with the first person to figure out we lived in a computer program run by aliens…despite what the evidence tells you and me. I think reality has been manipulated and changed. For example, I’ve had a delusion that I came up with something very similar to _NAME_’s proof that we live in a Computer Simulation in a past life / parallel universe…among several other proofs or stuff like the Riemann Hypothesis (past life), for example. Not sure why…maybe some sort of experiment or something. Anyways, there is no evidence, no proof, and no-one believes me for good reason. I don’t 
even really believe it myself entirely. I also have memories of ET abductions where they told me there are only 2 simulations left…not sure if real… I think a lot of people hate me (including aliens) because of my behaviors, thoughts, and beliefs. At least in my past lives/parallel universes. I can’t really blame myself because of what happened to me on several occasions. For instance, I remember they came up with immortality (another dream) in a past life. I can go on a thousand more times / posts, but I will not. Things come and go. I really like _NAME_ (solely because of simulation theory). I had a memory of emailing him in a past life/parallel universe (among other scientists) about his work but I don’t do that anymore for my own safety. You never know who is watching or whatever…I basically told him the machines were aware of his work and that he did a good job…that’s all. I guess it spooked him… Anyways, that’s why I have rules and such where I avoid people and never talk about anyone 
anymore and keep to myself. These are delusions from my past. He’s a great guy whom I respect. I also have memories of _NAME_ in another parallel universe / past life. I guess this is another delusion I have. I guess I’ll stop there. I cannot trust my mom’s memory because it is very, very poor. I told her my delusion about KPAX or Prot and she swears I never told her that. I think I brought it up again like two days ago. So I’m thinking I shifted into a slightly different parallel universe or her mind was wiped like mine and possibly others. I have not and cannot rule out extraterrestrial influences and other earthly influences."

Secondly, the coincidence between 2 distinct celestial events don’t add up to a third, larger celestial event. This is clearly faulty reasoning on your part. Thirdly, you are conflating 2 very different meanings of significance, but you probably already knew that. That’s usually referred to as moving the signposts as you find it convenient to do so. Fourthly, why post this “science and society” post in the unusual beliefs section? Fifthly, there is nothing unusual about 2 planets coming - from our narrow earthly perspective - closer together. The unusual thing would be if they didn’t As long as you continue to conflate rare or infrequent or “culturally worth celebrating” with “significant” you’ll remain in cuckoo land.

176014129,"Technically yes as serotonin opposes dopamine. But another problem is when serotonin is increased focus and concentration get reduced which make some individuals uninhibited which if coupled with positive symptoms like mania, paranoia etc can make them go out of control. Another thing which also oppose dopamine is acetylcholine. Several things raise acetylcholine in brain like lione’s mane mushroom, choline enhancers like cdp choline. These two are strong acetylcholine enhancers and can reduce dopamine in some. Weak ones like omega 3 fish oil, phosphatidylserine, holy basil (tulsi) can also reduce dopamine level a bit. But these all can’t be substituted for AP as the effect is not much noticeable for people who already experiencing positive symptoms. These useful for general public who occasionally get mild positive symptoms like anxiety, anger, irritability etc thus to calm their mind."

Then you divide by one less than the total number of data points. That gives you the variance. You take the square root to find the standard deviation."
176014239,"During the course of binary exchanged dialogues between the person’s mind and the hallucination entity (s) ,which span a very long time of wakefulness,it does not happen by mistake even for a once that the hallucination tells the person it is his psychological self nor it a separate part thereof,or trying to forcing the person to believe with a something such as During the mutual dialogue ,the hallucination (s) is speaking to the person ,referring to him with pronoun (You),while the person speaking to the hallucination entity (s) ,referring to it by one of the following pronouns; he,she or they When you see a person with sz living alone,while he seems as he speaking to himself In reality,he does not speak to himself (as you think),nor he listens to his self-thoughts,rather he is not in a one-sided dialogue with himself ,but he in the case of two-way,reciprocal dialogue with another interlocutor (s) ( a parasitical psychological entities be called hallucination),regardless of his identity or where

Now I have to move my chair and computer and everything because I walked in front of the tv last night when my sister was watching a show. So I have to put my chair across the room from the tv so I won’t cross in front of the tv when I get up to go to the restroom or the kitchen. Who does that? She’s being unreasonable. People get up. It takes a couple seconds. It’s not like she missed any of her show. Is the tv really that important that you can’t miss 4 seconds while someone gets up? Omg. Oh well. No big deal. I’ll move my chair if it makes her happy but I still think there is more to this than the tv. I think she’s mad about something else and punishing me in her weird way. I just don’t like change and I’ve had plenty lately.

176014289,For me a good test to see if you are ill is pretend a stranger you don’t know comes up to you and tells you all the stuff you’ve been thinking. Would you think they sound crazy? If so you’re probably ill. For example back when I thought I was going to be the mother of the antichrist I thought to myself ok but if someone else came up to me and told me they were going to be the mother of the antichrist I’d think they were ill. Why am I exempt from that? That mindset helped me escape many delusions before getting too sucked into them.

Cognitive behaviour therapy is based on this and enrolling to therapy will greatly help. Medications also help but even on medications paranoia can still come so therapy is must even if on medication or not for good progress."

What I have been reading says that as an intervention therapy and for a year or two after positive symptoms that the use of anti-psychotics is very effective. However, (what I have been reading says) as time goes on and you move into the long term (I have been on anti-psychotics for 12 years now) the anti-psychotics become less effective and cause serious life threatening weight gain and diabetes. There is no research that has been done that proves either the necessity or effectiveness of anti-psychotics past 3 years."

This going alongside difficulties with social interaction. Those resulted in some teasing while at prep school, but nothing like what I experienced at public school. Being physically and socially awkward/naive made me a prime target for bullies. That lead first to social anxiety and then depression and then severe mental mental illness. There were of course other factors such as being more susceptible to developing a severe mental illness . It was a combination of the two rather than either of them singly that resulted in severe mental illness."

Unfortunately when you’ve been psychotic for 22 years that’s not as wonderful as it sounds as I was also angry, lonely because the voices left for a while (which returned later), and kinda dangerous.

176014398,"Yeah I’ve been stable on meds for like 2 years now. My parents initially did not allow me to seek psychiatric help. Then I did it myself, and had a horrible experience with side effects and had periods of time where I was like I dont need meds I’m never trying meds again, as a lot of people on here have experienced. But then my symptoms would flare up again and I’d give up and go back on meds. Now I am very happy with my meds and they control my symptoms very well. My life is not hell anymore."

Saying that. I got a divorce and stopped talking to her for years simply to get that done. The reasons I left don’t change either even after all this time. Like I love that girl and she did a lot for me but she’s a mess. I would need millions to keep her happy and that is just life… I think you did things for your reasons so stay strong and I’ll support you in that. Move forward. Tomorrow is another day but do what is good for you now. The rest will sort itself out. You can be friends later if the fates will it. …And.

176014417,I got my final audit from the IRS. I had to pay about $1200 more for 2017. I had claimed a roof repair that they said should have been under depreciation and that was for about $7000 so I owed a little bit. First they said I owed like $3600 but I sent in documentation and got it lowered. I shouldn’t get in trouble now but I don’t have enough money to pay my mortgage on time now. I am going to have to pay it late next time I get paid. I put the check in the mail for the US Treasury yesterday so it will go out on Monday. I had to respond by the 20th. At least that’s behind me. If it were still $3600 not only could I not afford to pay it but I would have probably lost my job.

174345354,"My priest was really good in identifying my illness away from religion. When I talked with him about my concerns, his words were: “Why are you here talking to me? You need to go and see a psychiatrist.” I was a Catholic in good standing and had nothing contrary to the faith, so he always helped me to seek help when needed. In another words, he was telling me that religion and psychosis are two different things."
174345360,"I also think she’s trying to use you. I used to do the same to my parents, threating them to kill myself if they didn’t give me money to feed my shopping, weed and sex addictions. When it got so bad, I just realized that all this need to stop so I stopped the Abilify and later stopped all my addictions including weed. In my case I had addiction issues psychologically and from Abilify. What helped me waking up is that my situation got so bad that I got threatened by gangsters, that I emptied my bank account and that I was taking cash advances from my Visa which I couldn’t pay. My parents made a deal with me, I stop all my addictions and they will pay my debts. Your daughter needs to learn it the hard way to get out of it."

176014435,"I might have a new roommate. I interviewed some guy this morning. He’s 50 but looks younger. He seems alright. He walked up with his mother/caregiver and my first impression was that my heart sunk a little. He looked like a Hell’s Angel or something; all dressed in black but looks were deceiving and I breathed a sigh of relief after he was here a few minutes. He just speaks normally, he’s not trying to act tough or be intimidating. He turned out to be a mellow, alright guy. His mom was tougher though, she was very forceful and when she said we should get rid of the desk in the living room (which I’ve always liked) and I balked, I could tell she was not used to hearing no. The desk stays, just for the principle of the thing. Yeah, she tended to dominate him and it almost made me a little uncomfortable, I felt like putting my two cents in and sticking up for him but even though he’s mellow I could tell he’s been around and so I kept quiet. But I think I screwed myself. His mother kept bri
nging up his business and telling us his faults and how he’s going to start exercising and eating right and getting out of the house every day and it sounded sincere and all good. But my heart sank again when they were on their way out and it was just me and him alone in the living room and he shook my hand and told me that he was going to mostly be spending his days sleeping in his room. I don’t know about anyone else who has roommates but in my experience, someone, including myself, who stays home too much is a problem. Especially since this apartment is so small. I’ve struggled with this problem ever since I moved out on my own. When I lived at my sisters for 3 years I was working and going out with my sister and her friends and usually going to three AA meetings a week and I had a friend who I would visit often. And I when I lived by myself for 6 years, of course I didn’t hurt anyone by staying home. But I rented a room in this couples house for 6 months a few years ago and they complained I was h
ome too much and so I had to force myself out. That’s just the way it is when you have a roommate. And getting back to the new roommate it depressed me that in front of his mom he promised he would go out and be gone but then he tells me when she out of the room that he will spend most of his time home sleeping. It does not bode well for me. And when they left my counselor asked me what I thought and I told her my misgivings and what he said. But the counselors don’t want to rock the boat and they want this apartment filled and so she put pressure on me to not to complain. I was tired and he seemed alright and so I let it go but now I’m having my doubts and wondering if I will be happy with this roommate. I’m in a weird position, and he will probably move in. I have my misgivings but I’ll just have to have faith and figure this will work out."

I need the support of others to point out what I can’t figure out myself. Here’s what has helped the past six months of sobriety: the decision not to use is simple, but not easy: I am unwell when I use and I will never be well if I continue to use. cravings pass. The average craving lasts 20 minutes. Find something to do when the desire to use strikes. think of everyone you’ll disappoint if you use/continue using. do everything to avoid the first puff. if you are like me (an addict), the joint is hard to give up once it is picked up.

174345357,"_AT_MENTION_ ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Correlates and management of comorbid anxiety disorders in schizophrenia. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Industrial psychiatry journal , Jul-Dec 2018 Only a few studies have examined the treatability of anxiety disorders in schizophrenia, even though it is generally accepted that in the absence of schizophrenia, the anxiety disorders are safely and effectively treatable.The aim of this study was to study the relation of anxiety disorders with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the effect of treatment of different anxiety disorders in schizophrenia patients.The study was carried out on inpatients of a tertiary care psychiatric hospital using a purposive sampling technique. The schizophrenia patients were evaluated for psychopathology and the presence of anxiety disorder at baseline. After being prescribed with antipsychotic medication in a suitable dose for 8 weeks, they were followed up at monthly intervals for the course of both schizophrenia and anxiety 
disorders. Thereafter, an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was also prescribed to the schizophrenia patients with comorbid anxiety disorder, and the patients were again followed up for a period of 8 weeks to assess the progress of schizophrenia and anxiety disorder.The prevalence of anxiety disorder in 93 schizophrenia patients included in the present study was 45.16%. The most common comorbid anxiety disorders in schizophrenia patients were panic disorder (18.27%), social anxiety disorder (9.68%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (8.60%), and agoraphobia (6.45%). Schizophrenia patients with anxiety disorder had a significantly higher positive score of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) and a significantly lower score on the negative scale and the general psychopathology scale of the PANSS, as compared to the scores of the schizophrenia group without anxiety disorders. Schizophrenia patients with anxiety disorders responded well to the combination of SSRIs and antipsyc
hotics but not antipsychotics alone.Comorbid anxiety disorders are common in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients with anxiety disorders differ significantly from those without anxiety disorders in their basic psychopathology. These anxiety disorders are quite responsive to the SSRIs but not to antipsychotics alone. Further, there is a shorter duration of illness in schizophrenia patients with anxiety disorders as compared to schizophrenia patients without anxiety disorders assigning a prognostic significance to the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in schizophrenia."

176014486,"I just want to isolate and stay away from people because I think people don’t care and people won’t love me anymore. It’s becoming a serious problem because I don’t ever want to go out and make friends. People terrify me so much, and people scare me and I’m afraid of people. I’m worried that I’m going to be hurt by people again and I want to avoid contact with people as much as I can. I think no one will accept my psychosis and accept who I am as a disabled person with physical and mental disabilities. I’m quite different from others in a noticeable way. I think I have too many faults and I just want to stay inside and hide. I hate people and I hate society. I just want to stay inside and stop socializing with people, and stay on the Internet. I think people aren’t going to love me and I just want to avoid negative interactions because I’ll look inapt to them. I just hate my life."
176014487,That is a bit of a simplified answer. Do I legitimately think my symptoms just magically got better? No. I think I learned how to manage them better as well as found good medication and this has drastically reduced the severity and frequency of my symptoms. Of course they are doing better as opposed to when I was a teenager and getting 3-5 hrs of sleep a night and didn’t know what psychosis was and had no form of mental or emotional support no meds nothing.

I used to drink energy drinks but I know those are really bad for me so I switched to mountain dew for now. I dont remember exactly when they started. My time and memory are all wonky right now. It’s been going on for a few weeks for sure though. They’ve been getting more frequent too. I think the more anxious and stressed I get the more prone I am to getting these nightmares.

176014509,"Hi, just wanted to share how I finally uh “got help”. So a couple months ago, I was just having a normal day full of paranoia because of my grades when I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor to freak out. So the doors in my house have locks that are easy to open from the other side so in order to have privacy I pull the drawer in front of the door like a dead bolt situation. Anyways, eventually I fall over on the floor and can’t move. Normally I can’t move for like a minute before I can move again but this time I could not move whatsoever. I’m not sure how long I was lying there, but it must have been a while because in the position I was in my back started to hurt. Normally how I get out of this is I’ll focus on just twitching a finger. Once I get movement I’ll repeat that over and over trying to incorporate more muscles until I have an arm free and so on. At this point, all I could do was move my fingers and move my head with enough momentum. Obviously I was starting to freak 
out because I couldn’t let my family question where I was and then find me like this. But eventually I realized I needed help. All I needed was for someone to nudge my arm with their foot and I’d be able to move fairly quickly. So my goal was to calmly guide one of my family members to open the door a crack and shove something through to close the drawer so they could assist me. Because I didn’t want to cause a commotion, I didn’t want to yell for help, so I had a weird out of body experience where I went downstairs to signal my mother somehow. Each time I was pulled back to my body, I’d be able to move my hand. So if I didn’t succeed in getting my mother’s intuition to flare up, I’d at least be able to try and get up. After a couple tried of this, I decided it was no use. After more failed attempts to regain movement and plenty of time passing, my brother tried to get me for dinner. I told him I was in the bathroom and to grab my mother because I thought if I explained to her in a calm manner 
she would do what I said. He yelled to my mother that I need her and she told me to come down myself. What followed gets a little _USER_ID_ but essentially was back and forth yelling until she realizes something is wrong and she loses her ????. My mother is screaming through the door for me to open it and out of sheer will power I lift my arm to knock the drawer which is enough to open it and I am promptly hit in the head with the door. Trigger warning because I don’t want to trigger anyone. This is kind of _USER_ID_ as well but my mother comes in and decides the best way to handle the situation is to start beating the ???? out of me. I think she kicks me a couple times when I’m on the floor and sits me up to hit me in the head a few times too. My siblings are in the hall screaming for her to stop because I can’t move so I can’t even defend myself. She starts screaming stuff like “what did you do” and “what did you take” and I can barely tell her that I didn’t do anything. My father finally 
intervenes when she starts choking me against the cabinets and he has to pry her off. My father is asking if I’m okay and trying to get me to stand up but it takes me a while to be able to stand up and walk. He tells me to get dressed so we can go to a hospital and my mother follows me into my closet and rants about what a piece of ???? I am and I’m not going to the ER during corona and I’m a selfish ????? etcetera. Eventually as I’m trying to go down the stairs she starts asking if I was “self-harming like a freak” which I responded with no and tried to walk away. She kept screaming for me to not walk away but I go to the garage to get shoes on. I overhear my parents talking through the door and open the garage door to give my father an out from the conversation. When we start driving I break down and he’s trying to ask what happened and if I need to go to a hospital. I say no and what follows is him trying to figure out what’s wrong and being met with “I can’t tell you” but finally he 
gets out of me that I have hallucinations. He makes me explain them to him but I only tell him about generic stuff and not the people I see. We drive home (we would have stayed somewhere else but we had no where we could go) and I apologize to my mother for scaring her and my father tells her a bit of what happened. I end up leaving and consoling my siblings when I get inside because they were seriously freaked out and I still feel guilty about it. My mother ends up driving away for a while. I take a shower and go to the room I’m borrowing and my father comes in to inquire more. I basically repeat stuff and then he says if I start to see or hear anything to come and get him which why would I ever look to any of them for support. I promise I’ll just fall right to sleep but obviously I didn’t. I’m awake when my mother arrives and I hear the two of them talking and I’m up well past the end of their conversation. The next day my mother makes me tell her what I told my father because he couldn’t explai
n ???? and my mother kept getting angry because I didn’t want to tell her. She ends up spewing ???????? about how meds alter your brain and I’ll be a zombie and therapists just tell you to journal and basically just tells me to stop being a recluse and to take my vitamins and her essential oil ????. She says I can do therapy if I want because she’s starting therapy because of past traumas (which she ends up blaming her reactions on). Nothing has really come of it, my parents act like nothing happened except my mother throws it in my face whenever it suits her, saying stuff like I belong in a mental institution. So cool, I’m scared to be here but the only friend I have lives 4 states away and I can’t call CPS or anything. Anyways, don’t do what I did and wait until something happens. I seriously regret that they found out, especially when I was about to tell them as an excuse to why my grades were low. So ???? me in the ass ig, what impeccable timing. Sry this is long."

People can’t truly understand that fear unless they’ve had a strong taste of it thru psychosis. It’s a very lonely place to be in wen no one is real anymore. In that way I feel mentally seperate.

176014599,"Had a hobby I enjoyed doing and obsessed over it to the point of annoyance for those around me. Did that for 2 weeks and realized it’s going to take years to be any good at it. Now I’m feeling stupid because I know I’m going to suck at it for years and years before I’m any good. I know it’s good for character to suck at something but to just push through. But I’ve never done that before. I want to stay with it, I’m just worried I’ll end up putting years of my life into it and I’ll still be no good. Would it be true to say that it doesn’t matter if I suck, and that I should pursue it just because it offers a distraction and relieves some of the pain? I stared at a wall nd paced around my room for like 2 years, so I definitely don’t wanna go back to that bs."

176014602,"I we can have rather traumatic experiences in psychiatric hospital. Sounds like you had a awful time. I was really scared in psychiatric hospital too. Specially the first time when I was restrained by five or so on my belly so I couldn’t breath properly and then injected and locked in a tiny room with nothing soft in it and hard cold bright bad light and it smelt of vomit , urine and sh it. Last time I begged them not to put me in isolation room and thankfully they did not . I was refusing medication but after they forced medication in me they took me to my room.A “normal” room. To be restrained to a bed like you were sounds so scary and traumatic . Hope you are feeling better now."

176014604,"I filled out my disability paperwork today. It took me hours. I read, “send this back in ten days or we could deny you benefits”. It was postmarked May 23. Tomorrow I have a funeral to go to. It will be very crowded. I will only know a handful of people. My counselor didn’t call me today, without explanation. He’s counseled me for four and a half years and has never missed an appointment. I’m worried he’s dead. Without counseling, I become confused and overwhelmed by my thoughts. I can’t tell what is true and not. I can’t tell who is real and not. I lost nine pounds. I worked so hard. I’m gaining it back. I’ve gained back 6 pounds. I suck as a person. I can’t even take a walk. I literally don’t move at all. I become winded and sore from standing to unload and load the dishwasher. I’m going to receive iv ketamine treatment. I need to line up child care and rides for two weeks. When can I fit this in? What if I have an adverse reaction? What if it doesn’t work? I have no m
otivation to do anything. It all feels hard. We’re thousands and thousands of dollars in debt. Five years ago when we married, I had $90,000 in the bank account because I was saving for a house. We never bought the house. We live on the third floor in a two bedroom apartment. The money is gone and still going. I can’t work. I cause my husband to miss work all the time. My clothes don’t fit. We don’t have money to buy new clothes. We’re supposed to go on vacation with my family. (My parents are paying for it.) What will I wear? I messed up at intensive outpatient program. There were too many misunderstandings and disagreements with the therapists. My parents spent $20,000 on it. I messed it all up. I’m backsliding with my ocd. I wasn’t at a good place to begin with. We’ve lived in our apartment for three years. No one has ever been in. My kids have never showed their toys or beds or books to anyone, including their grandparents. Now, I can’t even touch the faucet in my own bathroom with my ba
re hand again. I’m back to using a paper towel."

176014610,"Hi guys. Beeing kind to myself is something my psychologist allways wanted for me, but i don´t even know what that means. He said that I was an “extreme” person; when i was motivated to do something I dindn´t give myself a break and I allways ended up tired and miserable, and that went through a cycle of not doing anything. He also said that I needed to program breaks every week to not burn myself and that I needed to be kind to myself when I “failed” at something. In my experience if you want something in life, moreover if you have a mental disorder, you need to be very strict with your goals. What is the difference between beeing kind to ourselves and allowing ourselves to do nothing in life?"

They also wouldn’t come until I thought I was in view of a ‘camera’ but towards the end they turned omnipresent. I was lucky at the start and the middle, where they didn’t follow me anytime I left the house. my belief was so strong that I had cameras in the house that I thought they couldn’t see me if I left, and I wouldn’t hear voices. Of course it didn’t take long for them to turn omnipresent. I’m also lucky that I had a med increase around two months after they turned omnipresent. To sum up I heard voices for a full year on and off and was also delusional for the same amount of time _USER_ID_ I still hear voices everyday but they are very faint, but they get louder when I get overwhelmed stressed"

I haven’t really read the paperwork or fine print in detail, but somnelence and dry mouth are 5% or less common. who knows it might be a doozer. But I have to try. I was once diagnosed with treatment resistant undifferentiated schizophrenia. I tried a lot of things and the newest meds because I really, really want to recover. I am trying everything. I could eat healthier and exercise and try to volunteer I guess too. I am weak minded because of the mental illness. It has it’s psychological toll on me.

And psychiatrists that didn’t listen to me or didn’t take me seriously. And me not knowing how to stand up for myself. But finally after years of trying different meds I finally found a combination that gets rid of my symptoms without side effects and I actually feel BETTER. So I want to take my meds. I want to stay on my meds. If you don’t feel good then switch until you do feel good. If you don’t feel good it means you haven’t found the right medicine. It doesn’t mean that all medicine is bad. If your Psychiatrist doesn’t like it then find a better one and explain to them that you’re tired of feeling bad. It doesn’t happen over night because it takes so long to determine if a medicine is going to work, like 4 weeks or more. And some side effects go away after 8 weeks. S

I don’t think schizophrenia is a punishment, no more than cancer, heart disease, dying in a needless war, or any of the other myriad things that human beings suffer from. Sure, schizophrenia is tough but so is drowning in a tsunami, being wrongly convicted and sent to prison for thirty years, or children being sold into the sex trade.

176014735,"I read an article which said that people with MI can get stressed out when siblings come home. My brother and sister visited this month. It stressed me out! I’ll go out on a limb and say that even people who haven’t got MI may have a hard time with those visits, especially when the house is full of relatives. Additionally, like with my dad, relatives may be insensitive…or even in denial that you are mentally ill. Normal healthy people are competing in the economy…etc. So, I feel, there can be a callousness and arrogance, even without grandiosity. If people are angry or arguing, it makes me sad. Another reason which causes stress for me, I think, is that siblings (or other relatives) may have reached levels of life achievement I haven’t, and that can remind me that I’m not doing as well. To become jealous of my siblings is a source of stress! Because of my deficits in social cognition, I can find it hard to talk to people, because I simply struggle to read facial expressions.

174345444,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia liability shares common molecular genetic risk factors with sleep duration and nightmares in childhood. _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Wellcome open research , 2019 Background: Sleep abnormalities are common in schizophrenia, often appearing before psychosis onset; however, the mechanisms behind this are uncertain. We investigated whether genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with sleep phenotypes. Methods: We used data from 6,058 children and 2,302 mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We examined associations between a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia and sleep duration in both children and mothers, and nightmares in children, along with genetic covariances between these traits. Results: Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with increased risk of nightmares (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14, p=0.02) in children, and also with less sleep (?=-44.52, 95% CI: -88.98, -0.07; p=0.05). We observed a si
milar relationship with sleep duration in mothers, although evidence was much weaker (p=0.38). Finally, we found evidence of genetic covariance between schizophrenia risk and reduced sleep duration in children and mothers, and between schizophrenia risk and nightmares in children. Conclusions: These molecular genetic results support recent findings from twin analysis that show genetic overlap between sleep disturbances and psychotic-like experiences. They also show, to our knowledge for the first time, a genetic correlation between schizophrenia liability and risk of nightmares in childhood."

Increasing evidence supports the benefits of regular aerobic exercise for cognition and functioning in schizophrenia. The extent to which t TL:DR: adding ~150 minutes workouts per week (at 60-80% max heart rate, in 4 sessions of about 40 minutes a week over 6 months) to Brain HQ and SocialVille online cognitive training improved results significantly. In a randomized controlled trial with 47 first-episode patients with schizophrenia, we contrasted six months of Cognitive Training & Exercise (CT&E) with Cognitive Training (CT) alone. The computerized cognitive training using PositScience BrainHQ and SocialVille programs was provided to all participants, four hours/week at the UCLA clinic for six months. The CT&E group also participated in total body circuit training exercises, with a goal of completing 150 minutes/week. Both groups showed cognitive and work/school functioning gains, but the

Biomedical engineers at the Tufts University School of Engineering have developed tiny lipid-based nanoparticles that incorporate neurotranmitters to help carry drugs, large molecules, and even gene editing proteins across the blood-brain barrier and into the brain in mice. The innovation, published today in Science Advances , could overcome many of the current limitations encountered in delivering therapeutics into the central nervous system, and opens up the possibility of using a wide range of therapeutics that would otherwise not have access to the brain. “It’s simple, effective, and potentially broadly applicable—we can modify the container f
or the drug, and by adding the NT-lipidoid, it’s like attaching an address label for delivery into the brain” said _PERSON_, post-doctoral scholar in the _PERSON_ lab at Tufts. “We envision that a wide range of neurological therapeutics could eventually be tried that were previously thought to be impractical due to limitations in delivery,” said _PERSON_, graduate student in the _PERSON_ lab. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are co-first authors of the study. The study authors made use of the fact that certain neurotransmitters have the chemical “passport” required to gain access throughout the brain. By attaching a lipid (fat-like) molecule to the neurotransmitter, the resulting NT-lipidoid can be doped into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) - tiny bubbles of lipid that can encapsulate other molecules within, in particular therapeutic drugs. The LNPs can be injected intravenously, and carry the drugs to the blood-brain barrier, while the NT-lipidoid helps the LNPs to carry the drugs across the barrier. The LNPs ca
n then fuse with neurons and other cells in the brain to deliver their therapeutic payload. Obviously it will be a long time before this is used in humans. However it’s a huge step and very good news. Some therapies for a number of different brain illnesses could be tried without the risk of injecting something into the brain, it would just be an IV."

176014812,Has anyone on this forum ever been on Zyprexa? If yes what are the side effects you experienced with this medication? My pdoc is thinking of putting me on Zyprexa because of my high prolactin levels caused by Invega. Does Zyprexa cause prolactin levels in males to spike?

174345464,"They said "" schizophrenia is a heritable psychotic disorder characterized by positive (e.g hallucinations and delusions)and negative (e,g apathy and flattened affect)symptoms "" When you consider the sz a disease (any disease ): The disease is not a name be written or said,rather,it is a specific pathogen,has a structure,functions,mechanisms of influence that cause the release of a group of symptoms such as positive ,negative and cognitive ,where is such these characteristics in the report ? Before making any comparisons between the sz and any other condition or made up any casual relationship between sz and any causes; It is assumpted that there is extensive,confirmed and scientifically proven knowledge about the essential nature of the sz condition It is not acceptable to make comparisons or similarities between sz any any other case in the absence of actual basic data about the nature of what is sz Such as introduction that is written at the beginning of the report and is repeated with differen
t implications in all reports related to the sz condition . It lacks the most important factor,which is the absence of actual,real data that describing the main nature of sz case in accordance with its basic reality When you say ""sz is a heritable psychotic disorder "" It is only an alternative hypothesis that has been released in media until it is scientifically proven later ,and all reported like that ! Instead of agree with a logic: the accused is innocent until proven guilty , it has been replaced to a logic: the accused is guilty until proven guilty ! In practice,the prevailing logic of all reports of sz,assume that schizophrenia is a disease until it is proven later-even if the evidence take a thousand years or more ! Therefore,we must wait many years for this prophecy to materialize !"

176014866,"The author’s reasoning for each is this: Capacity for pleasure - When you engage in an activity you enjoy, you probably have more fun than a neurotypical person would doing the same activity. Because all your emotions are experienced in an intense way, you get the benefit of extreme joy. Courage and optimism - When you feel your emotions so intensely, you are less apt than a neurotypical person to use self-talk to regulate the level of arousal. Because you may not always think about your own reactions to events, your passion may at times cause you to persist in your pursuit of something despite “rational” reasons to stop. There is less communication between the thinking and emotional brain, which can result in incredible courage and optimism."

174345469,"I use a similar program to My Fitness Pal to count calories. Mine is called Sparkpeople. It has a nutrition tracker you can use to log your food intake and see how many calories you have in a day. When you first get started it takes a little bit longer, but there are lists for your favorite foods as well as food groupings you can make so you can log multiple foods with one entry. For example, I have my veggie burgers and peanut butter sandwiches as groupings so I don’t have to enter each thing separately. Now it only takes me about ten minutes to plan meals for a full week. I am trying to lose two pounds per week. Sparkpeople says I can eat 1200-1550 calories per day, but while I’m just at home and not as active I do 1200-1400. Once I start volunteering, then working, I will allow myself to go up into the 1500s on the days I’m out. I have a collapsed disc in my spine so I can’t exercise enough to burn significant calories. I have to rely on my diet alone. Calorie counting works! I am down 1
1 pounds so far toward a short-term weight loss goal of 49 pounds gone. I just started losing weight 11 weeks ago. I lost my Abilify weight already just by going off the drug. My weight gradually came down without any changes in diet. That was a really bad weight gainer for me. Now I want to lose my Geodon weight. I started at a high of 319 pounds, I’m currently 256. I want to get to 219, then 180. I know it’s hard when you have so much to lose, but you can do it! You don’t have to do anything fancy like the keto diet, just shrink your portions and you can lose weight. Calorie counting is not hard to do when you use one of the online programs and apps. Sparkpeople will give you the right calorie range when you enter your starting and goal weights, so you can go off that. Good luck! I know you can do it!"

174345481,Hey learning to cope with the negative symptoms has been one of the hardest things I’ve had to overcome with schizophrenia too. And I just came across this awesome process today which is helping me feel things that I normally automatically repress. It is in this article here: https://scottjeffrey.com/shadow-work/?fbclid=IwAR1_31UC86GiQ9tdiogiXgh9KkR8ddeQPsxu12ofqX3Zh21TMfzqB4bfzFM and is called ‘The 3-2-1 shadow process’ which is number 5 of the exercises.

This could all end horribly, horribly, horribly for me, but heck, what can I do about it? I’m in a block universe, looking forward to my next “episode”."

It’s April 26th now and still facing this stuff. The voices are saying the reason why they havent picked me up yet is because they are preparing a facility to torture me at. I won’t even begin to say the atrocities they are claiming to plan for me… Just let me assure you IT IS AWEFUL. I’m trying to trust in God to get me through this.

174345486,"Hi yeah I’ve heard somataform disorder is common in people with schizophrenia. I don’t have schizophrenia but do have disturbing thoughts at times and visual as well. I’ve accepted that I have somataform disorder but I also think its neurological as well. Maybe I am delusional. It’s a mixed bag of things. I will be talking to my psychiatrist in the next couple of weeks through video chat so if he has a plan for me, will know then. I’m taking 300mg quietapine, 10mg of abilify and 225mg of effexor plus 300mg lyrica. The medication is working for different issues I have. My concern is that the woozy head and clumsiness is always there plus the unbalance and disoriented feeling. These symptoms I believe are neurological. The somataform disorder m, depression and unwanted thoughts I believe are psychological and perhaps I have symptoms of both if you know what I mean. I just hope things dont worsen. My brain scans are stable with no progression whatever that means I don’t know except that my 
scans are not pointing to anything neurological Do you know if schizophrenia progresses. I mean can an MRI show schizophrenia in certain areas of the brain. My lesions are in the right frontal lobe mostly with some on the left. One neurologist said the lesions were in the juxtacortical area of my brain. But I do not have MS. One other neurologist said a process may be happening but he wouldn’t go further than that. Maybe they can see schizophrenia on the brain, I dont know."

176014919,i was found treatment resistant sz too… but eventually they put me on a combo of the risperdal consta 50mg depot 2 weekly and 200mg of clozapine per day and that combo works for me.
176014920,I have a medication lock box where I keep all my meds in it. Lock and key. No one has access to my meds but me. (although my parents know where the spare is). It’s more for safety reasons than paranoia. I think it’s the responsible thing to do with these types of meds. Last thing you would want is a child to get a hold of one or something. I suggest getting a lock box. This is the one I have. It’s large and fits a lot of medications.
176014921,"I think either I had a super rare side effect from topamax (psychosis) or I ended up getting bizzare, paranoid memories and past life recall from the combination of topamax and an MRI! I couldn’t see outside my head because of severe DP/DR (trauma induced dissociation) and I started being able to see and get less dissocated from Topamax. It got to the point, I was messing with my electrical outlets because I thought I was being spied on or listened too because of the power/phone/ethernet thing/wires. Same thing with the fan above my room. I thought everything was bugged. I would hear my thoughts (no auditory hallucinations or voices) and think I could hear people talk about me from far away and they could listen and sense my movements. I also thought I had thermal cameras in the walls because my step father put sensors in there and is an electrical engineer and he used them to take temperatures in the whole house."
176014922,"Yes, I think that’s a good idea."
176014923,But to be honest I wasn’t that stable on Abilify. But yes I was on Tegretol. I’m doing so well on Risperdal. It would be a shame to throw it all away.

176014943,Who told you you’re going to hell?
176014944,The weather recently has been fine. Not hot but not cold either. Plenty of cloudless days. Not much rain. Temperature sitting at around 25 C or thereabouts. At the moment we are in Autumn (or Fall if you are American). How about you?
176014945,"Maybe you could put on some kind of mild, heartening movie on, like “A Trip to Bounteful” or “Contact”, with _NAME_ Foster in it. She was great in that movie."

176014948,"My voices are the same, and they’ve said that I caused every word. Why do your voices say it’s your retribution?"
174345494,"I’m not diagnosed with depression but they did add an antidepressant to my meds. I have been on sertraline for long time now, so i don’t know if I still would need the antidepressant but since I’m finally stable they don’t really wanna change my meds anymore."
176014949,"Yes, I believe them"
174345493,"I never heard voices but I was amazed about 9 years ago when I had a friend over for dinner who had paranoid schizophrenia. I fixed spaghetti and a salad and we sat and talked at my table and then watched a little TV. I don’t know how it came up but he told me a week or two later he was hearing voices during the whole evening. I was amazed because he sounded and looked perfectly OK. (well, he was a little weird looking) but he talked normal and didn’t appear distracted, he seemed all there."
176014950,I take vitamin D and omega 3.
174345507,"_AT_MENTION_ I have been doing Tai Chi since 2006 but for both Martial Arts and Relaxation, a lot of people don’t realize it is actually Martial Arts,but when you do it slowly it is known as the form _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ style I have DVD/YouTube for this hope info helps"

176014953,but compared to like around 50 years ago we have made a whole lot of progress with helping sz with medicines. I’m happy for that!!
176014954,Welcome _AT_MENTION_
176014955,"That’s an interesting point, which reminds me of _PERSON_’ work on collective memory. It’s incredible how often we fall into the trap of assuming the ‘individual’ constitutes the natural analytical unit."
176014956,"Sober today, was craving some some uppers last night, had the fight myself back from chugging coffee and getting some OTCs. Counted the minutes and distracted myself. Feel better today, craving is gone. Heart goes out the everyone still fighting the good fight"
176014957,My peer support is suppos _NAME_ to take me to a game thing today. I don’t really want to go now. But i said i would. Do you think it would be ok to see if she wanted to go somewhere else or should i just go and try to get over my fear of being around people for an hour and a half? It’s board games and card games

176014959,"One time when I was in a mental hospital there was this guy who was trying to write a book. Saying his prose was lamentable would be giving it a compliment. It was barely coherent. But I envied that guy because it can be such a great feeling when you think you’ve done something good, whether it really was good or not."
176014960,I left a friend because he was a pervert everywhere and kept talking to me about prostitutes. His dad was a pervert too and talked to me about prostitutes when I was 14 y.o. Glad that I don’t have them in my life anymore. Made better and smarter friends.
176014961,Thank you so much _AT_MENTION_
176014962,This! _PHONE_NO_
176014963,Do you see a psychologist?
176014964,Not every doc is skilled in that.
176014965,I had a hearing. The judge asked me simple questions like could I maintain hygiene and if I had friends. I was in full-blown panic attack mode and I managed ok. The judge was understanding.
176014966,"I relate to your first post greatly. I feel like a hollow shell of my former self. To be honest I have only found a temporary fix. That is to accept myself as I am and compare myself to who I was yesterday. It is a difficult road, but one you can work on. I wish you the best of luck."

176014976,I really don’t believe that. I believe I’m being watched.
176014977,I like it especially when I listen to music.
176014978,Then I think it’s a good choice for you. Better to find a drug that works than having to keep going through one after another trying. It took me almost 4 years to find one that worked well. I tried over a dozen different meds. It was miserable.
176014979,"There’s an app called zombies run, it could distract you from your voices!"
176014980,a lot of szs are very sensitive to weed. They say that it could even lower the efficacy of meds working. Meaning your meds probably stopped doing their job fully when you took the thc. Which could’ve been what even made you psychotic if not the thc reaction itself also maybe. I’m not 100% sure. But judging by much of the literature this sounds about right. Stay away from thc and take your meds you don’t have mental health issues?? . Just wondering /clarifying
176014981,Absolutely sure. Never had a problem from withdrawl that lasted longer than 2 weeks.
176014982,"Welcome back _PERSON_. I’m intrigued: do you always retain a measure of insight regardless of the intensity of your hallucinations/delusions? As I don’t hear voices I crave for simplicity in my own so-called delusions. Accordingly, I’ve been busy shedding the gnostic elements of my beliefs in favour of what I call a desert theology, based on the 3 temptations of Christ. I’ve been in hospital for 2 and a half months now."
176014983,You should talk to your psychiatrist and come to a decision with them. They know you the best and know the best thing for you.
176014984,But I have dated someone that I feel matches this to a T. She had autism for sure but saw ghosts and auras. Not to say that means schizotypal but to her degree j would argue probably does.

176014988,"When unmedicated I had those thoughts about my cousin, luckily I don’t have a sister so less accessible. Idk why sz make some ppl commit rape and violence. I saw a sz show about those on Amazon Prime. I suggest you take Risperdal, it lowered my libido so much and removed those sexual thoughts. Tell your psychiatrist about Risperdal."
176014989,Go back on it until you’re stable. Then you can think of a plan B.
174345513,That is classified as “survival sex” and has no bearing on someone’s sexuality.
176014990,I had a therapist that seemed to not like me. If I had any choice I would have seen a different therapist. I didn’t like him either.
176014991,You need sleep more than anything. Stop Skipping Meditation… This is whats wrong with you . You have lost a good routine. Meditation can happen early in the day or late at night it will help you sleep as well as focus for the next day of events. I fear you will relapse or get sick if you don’t get back into a good routing.
176014992,Congratulations on the sobriety !
176014993,Ugh! This is really pointless. All of these therapists are the same. Probably just going to stick with my current therapist. She knows me well after years of seeing me and plus she’s a PhD. I’m just going to make her earn her money. No more palling around.
176014994,I can get out but only like once every 3+ months and its walking with my parents.

174345518,"Hi Everyone To cut a long story short I have had it tolerating the side effects of clozapine. eg IBS, all the blood tests, weight gain, sedation. I am thinking of asking my psychiatrist if i can go from clozapine to a combination of abilify/amisulpiride. I have been on this combination before and it worked. I don’t remember exactly why I came off it in the first place. Has anyone who has experience of this or similar please reply."
176015000,I’m an alcoholic and drug addict. That happened to me before the SZ did.

176015002,The upstate is definitely a lot more preferable than the bone-crushing Downs you’re describing I would definitely think bipolar plays in there somewhere. What is your diagnosis?
176015003,Been chilling…
176015004,I used to get this quite a lot but now it’s mild Even mild version it’s annoying isn’t it? I suppose aps get rid of it. I’d rather stay on a low dose ap than get rid of this mild thought disorder… Hope it’s not damaging my brain allowing it to stay. If I’m lucky it will still go away My mind does these other weird things similar to what u mentioned like I have to think things through actively in my mind rather than just giving up on a trail of thought

176015006,hmmm. interesting story. I hope the cold and stuff didnt harm you too much. Those nights when its cold outside can be really difficult. Hope it wasnt too difficult of an experience.
174345525,"I was on Risperdal for a short time and it felt like it was going to kill me. I was supposed to titrate to 6mg (this psychiatrist loved the highest dose possible) and it hit me when I got to 3mg. I immediately had no motivation. All I could do was smoke and drink coffee. I even had no appetite but somehow gained weight. I felt sedated but I wasn’t sedated, if that makes sense. Then I started dissociating for the first time in my life at 31 yo but I didn’t know what it was back then. They were like awful waking nightmares, lots of death, carnage and blood. I made the mistake of explaining them to my psychiatrist since I didn’t know what it was (started out like horrible anxiety) and she increased my dose to 4mg. Afterwards I told her that would be good punishment for sexual predators. This was chosen for me because I complained about Abilify giving me bad akathisia. My first 2 experiences with antipsychotics were horrible and the next 2 were also bad in different ways. The last wouldn’t have 
been as bad if I were single and didn’t care about sexual side effects."
176015007,I don’t see what that has to do with being nice to each other?
176015008,I am on antipsychotic… Since i had mania before they are not giving me antidepressants

176015014,"I agree! This nurse did wrong by you. To say what she said was unprofessional and awful. If such a thing was to be said it should come from the dr and in a very empathetic empowering optimistic way that you can still have quality of life and hope for the future. Welcome to the forum. I don’t think I have seen you here before.(poster)writing this welcome to original poster asking question as I’ve not seen before. I believe you can have a quality life and a better life than you have now if your husband is abusive I think you should leave him and not tolerate such behaviour. You should not be abused by anyone. A group home can give support and still give some independence and freedom. I lived in a group home for a while. I had my own room but shared bathroom, lounge and kitchen. I got to come and go rather freely . I didn’t feel comfortable eating with other people so I tried to take my food to my room and eat alone and they didn’t like that. There is staff 24/7. The staff were nice."
176015015,I faked being crazy to get in a psyche ward once. Big mistake.
176015016,Well it’s kind of the most dangerous drug (and the most powerful) so even though I’m on a very small dose I’m kinda wary of the side effects. I was meaning changing the abilify shot to abilify pills though.

Like _AT_MENTION_ said it is a partial agonist at the D2 receptor site like abilify, vraylar and rexulti, but to a greater extent as well as D4. I think this could huge for negative symptoms which might worsen on some APs due to less dopamine in certain receptors, but D1 is the main culprit (as far as we know) for sz But still, Ill believe it when I see it"

So the claim “my thoughts are broadcasting” is another assumption that people make to understand the observations? By the way, synchronicities are real events:"

176015055,"I got ill at age 19. Like a lot of guys on here, at that age, I wanted to lose my virginity. It was constantly on my mind. I wasn’t too good with women though, I may be wrong but back then every woman I was around, in public or elsewhere, seemed to put a vibe out towards me that they were unapproachable by me. Like they didn’t want me even to try to talk to them or get near them. Kinda made it hard to have sex, lol. My dad worked for the state of California as a surveyor and he was in charge of a little 5 person crew at that time. He had a woman on his crew who he became good friends with. It just happened that she was very good looking. She was about 28 years old at the time. Excuse my crudity but she had a smokin body too. I was in a group home and a few times my dad would drive the state truck to visit me and this woman friend would be with him. I met her and she was friendly and my dad must have discussed my situation with her. She had been around the block a few times and she was nice and 
she sized me up pretty well. She knew guys pretty well and to make a long story short, she could see I was desperate to lose my virginity. So she made an offer to my dad that she would have sex with me! Seriously. My dad told me about this and I couldn’t believe it, I was dumbfounded. But man, I was willing. But my dad told her no, I think because he was afraid it would be awkward to work with her after that (if she slept with me). I couldn’t believe my dad said no. She was fine! I was kind of mad at my dad for saying no. The second time was a year later when my parents made friends with the neighbors across the hall in our apartment. It was a young couple and the women’s sister always used to visit. My parents were a little older than them I think, they were around 45 and the young couple was in their 30’s. They were actually a little weird but they became friends and I was hospitalized at the time. On a weekend pass I met the three neighbors. The wife was not good looking but her sister was kind of 
cute and I was 21 and the biggest turn-on for me for some reason was older women. At that age they just seemed so exciting and sexually, I guess I thought if one of them liked me, an older women would “show me the ropes” when it came to sex. Anyways, I met the three and I was over their apartment and all of us used to go to the nearby school and play tennis. I used to be really good at tennis and so were my mom and dad and the sister was OK and it was fun. They knew I lived in the hospital and one day both sisters made an offer to visit me inside the hospital. I read between the lines and I knew the cute sister liked me and she could read me too and I was about 90% sure she would have sex with me. But the unfortunate problem was that my parents could see this too and they nixed the whole visit because they thought again it would be awkward. I was furious at my parents for wrecking that, I thought it was selfish of them. I couldn’t get the time of day from any other woman at the time and they wrecked my 
only chance. Those were about the only times that my parents really messed me up."
174345535,"Vanderbilt really seems to be doing some great work. Neurotransmission is facilitated through glutamate receptors. One of these, the AMPA receptor, is responsible for the brain’s ability to learn and remember information. Its functionality is directly connected to various cognitive disorders including autism, Alzheimer’s, limbic encephalitis, schizophrenia and strokes. _PERSON_’s team of researchers … have discovered evidence that an auxiliary subunit of the AMPA receptor and brain regulator GSG1L, which was discovered in _PERSON_’s lab in 2012, slows down brain cell activity in the anterior thalamus. This section of the brain is critical for memory formation, processing navigational information and seizure initiation. AMPA receptors are ideal targets for drug development because they are a ‘worker bee’, facilitating and modulating different actions in the brain.”"

If the powers that be, regardless of what you put your current belief system in, they’d probably make it so you’d never even suspect any preposterous type camera. On Wikipedia they once said that _PERSON_ strugglers are only average intelligence. That gets back to me with saying if someone wanted to, you’d never suspect it. Plus BY NOW they’d in all likelihood have done their worst by now. These are things your question made me think and I rehearse these types of things whenever my isolation makes me feel ‘a little special’."

176015091,"There’s no sure fire way of picking out an addict in a crowd. Addicts can probably spot other addicts but I can’t tell who is an addict and who isn’t. The warning signs to look for would be needing escalating doses of the oxycodone in order to maintain the same level of pain control. You might also notice increased sensitivity to pain, meaning that you have more issues with being hypersensitive to pain. Generally, after 1-2 month of regular use of opioids it’s likely to develop physiologic dependence. Your best option would be consulting an addiction medicine specialist who can safely switch her to a different medication which can then be weaned off. If she is ready to do it herself, about 25% reduction in dose every week should work as well. Most patients take medicines for pain that is not properly addressed, so consulting a good pain specialist for proper treatment would be the proper thing."

I want to at least finish the first part before I move on to reading something else.

176015096,"In my case there was this guy who spent a year trying to convince me I suffered from a specific personality disorder. At one point I was feeling so vulnerable I started considering whether he might be right even though I knew at a rational level that he wasn’t (after almost 30 years of seeing psychologists and pdocs somehow not noticing anything). I talked to the people who know me the best, including my ex, and they all thought he must be trolling or just being malicious. Eventually I discussed it at some length with my pdoc who was quite categorical that the whole personality disorder was complete bs. To my shame, and a perhaps a testimony to how sz can impact cognition, it took me a full year to realise that projection, a desire for control, and resentment were at the root of his behaviour, coupled with an extraordinary degree of blindness regarding people’s mental states (including his own) amounting perhaps to a partial, yet still fairly severe, case of dunning kruger syndrome.

176015150,"_AT_MENTION_ , what degenerative disease do u have and what is cardiomyopathy?"
176015151,"Yes, sex is only important for the production of kids in some societies. I’m planning on adopting. Nowadays we have artificial insemination. Soon we might have artificial wombs. But even before all this, men and women can find ways to reproduce without the practice of modern-day sex. However, some men are overtaken by lust, sadomasochism, and etc; especially by others who manipulate and exploit those weaknesses. Some people say that sex is natural. I know male hippos to kill offsprings, and lions to slay their own cubs. I would not practice something, simply because of its appearance in nature. I am a man and not an animal. Some men have different levels of self-control or are born with such, and I believe I was born with the potential for great self-control. I’ve read of mothers who’ve died while giving birth, or those who’ve birthed disabled or dead babies. I would never have a lady chance such horrible experiences or death, solely because of my lust, lack of self-control, or desire for o
ffspring. I care about women a lot, which is unusual since I’m a man. Very true. But alas, it’s good for me to exercise my antisexuality online because some societies don’t like antisexuals as much as they don’t like anyone who’s not heterosexual. If I express antisexuality offline, I can be attacked for it, where I live. Those societies don’t want antisexuals teaching against sex, because then kids won’t be produced and populations will drop. Then their armies, labor forces, and materials would shrink; and those societies would be vulnerable. This is why I feel that my city doesn’t teach adequate sex education, even though sex crimes are a huge issue for local women: some societies just want women to produce babies, regardless of consent or damage."
176015152,So true. We can influence our hallucinations and delusions by changing ourselves
176015153,Everything is subjective. Do what makes you happy.
176015154,"Insulting or not, but lots of us don’t exist in the terms of being “Universal”."
176015155,I don’t get complex delusions but they are intense just the same. Intelligence has nothing to do with it.
176015156,"So the reason I keep making a mess of things is because sexually I have been obsessed with Black male and White female couples, even though I am neither Black nor White, and pretty androgynous when it comes to non-physical mentality. I believe it is the way of London, which is split roughly a third each between Asian, Black and White. Asians mix with themselves sexually on the whole, whilst interracial relationships are more often between Black and White in my subjective observations. This sensitivity to the way may be the origin, but I have other theories. One is that I manifested my whole life, and the seeds were sown very early in childhood, but I don’t want to entertain solipsism at the moment. The more rational one is that I read “Soul on Ice” by _NAME_ as a teen and couldn’t get it out of my head. I have a tendency to believe everything I hear and read. I am critical but gullible, so to speak. Last night I had a dream about White teenage girls making a magazine, and invisible Black te
enage boys fighting visible White teenage boys. Again the premise for all of this was sex. Having had sex twice, I try to avoid thinking about it as much as possible now. It remains a trigger, being so intimately intertwined in my mind with the divisions of “race”, a word I don’t like, because I honestly don’t believe that life is competitive like a track “race”. I believe in the dance. How much therapy I need to overcome this depends in my mind to what extent the world and my environment overcome it. Sex has become political in my mind, and that is dangerous. Obviously I would like a family, my own offspring to raise as best I can, so I will have to face these triggers again. But they shouldn’t be a trigger at all. Fundamentally I believe it comes down to my heritage as a mixed-race (and the number of races is subjective) person, half-Cypriot, half-White. I don’t actually like using colour codes for race at all. White is worn both by Ifa priests traditionally and karate experts alike, to give 
but two examples. Colours are important, and I want to expand on the theory and science of colours in writing, possibly here or elsewhere, but colour is but one aspect of subjective (relativistic) race if indeed it is a component at all. There are no dominant genes. The first person who alerted me to this fact was an African geneticist whose name I forget but will try to look up again. _PERSON_’s theory of dominant genes is false. All genes contribute something. With regards to pigment, white people don’t have gene’s for melanin, so the gene from a White parent doesn’t contribute anything to colour, but rather to some other aspect, whilst the gene from someone with melanin contributes that. But both contribute equally in their different ways. The “race war” is the biggest delusion that I have when relapsing, I just want it to be over, but I still see so many people fighting, not all the time, but when the political world becomes unstable. _PERSON_ was right when he told the “Black” people of A
merica to stop going on about “race” in my opinion. I still don’t know what the beef between _PERSON_ and _NAME_ is… I had a delusion or insight, can’t tell which, that _PERSON_ had been beating his wife _PERSON_ and that was why he went to hospital. _PERSON_ is Armenian, a country I cannot even place on the map, though I know it is near Turkey. Thus to my mind she is not “White” or at least not fully. As Asians generally only mix with themselves, in my subjective experience, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are very special, and have a grave responsibility to act correctly at all times. I am not against the mixing of anyone, but both parents and ancestors have to give their consent, though children are certainly not property once they grow up. The idea that “Blacks” are more physical and sexual, which was outlined by _NAME_ so powerfully in his writings, goes back even before the arrival of slaves in America, something which I was horrified to discover, as it can be found in a more primitive and under
developed form in the introduction to Arabian Nights. I hate the idea of “Black” men as “walking penises” in the words of one anti-Cuban intellectuals criticisms. This concept has to be undone, it is a curse on “Black” men everywhere, though they say it is the best advertising they ever got. If “Black” men still want to be considered that way, it is there business, but to my mind it will only perpetuate racism and the “race war” to eternity. Of course, some things are eternal, but the nature of perception is that it changes, so whilst there will always be subjective “races” of some kind, the definitions need not stay the same. Perhaps in reality, I want to be seen as a “walking penis”, and am jealous. I don’t think so, that is not what women want, certainly not a “walking” one. When the time comes for me to have sex again I will, with whom I still don’t know, though I am working on a relationship at the moment to some extent. Why must I choose my relationships based on raci
st definitions of “race”, as I keep saying “race” is subjective, “race” is in the eye of the beholder. Thank you."
176015157,I didn’t notice much of a difference between 25 and 50. So I take 25. It is an odd med. the only difference on 25 was no nausea while 50 slight nausea. I would try 50 first but keep that in mind if you have any issues. You can split that pill in half pretty easily

174345551,I feel my sz. is so real. I have people wanting me dead which doesn’t make me feel too good. I wish I had people’s caring and understanding but sometimes I don’t even get that from the voices. They say they are just waiting until I die. I want to live though and to be left alone.
176015159,When my decisions started the voices where saying I was the sun and looked it up and it said that Jesus was the sun and then I started to think I was God. Then now the voices say that I was the sun but I smoked ciggs and that made me lose the game and they say I would have been a king and was chosen on my planet to be a king or go to hell forever but no they say I’m going to hell forever for ciggs. They say that all I had to do was quit for a day but I couldn’t and been smoking for 2 years strait. They say that the illuminati is god and the light is evil and tortures every thing after it dies
176015160,"It was in October 2016 when I was diagnosed with I think it was called non organic psychosis. I was hospitalised then and unmedicated, left the hospital feeling fine, and a week later lost insight totally again so was sectioned again. this is still my diagnosis although I have relapsed again since then. they say it is because my ap dose is low. and they say it is not drug induced although I had taken mdma with alcohol once a few months before it started."

176015163,In my case the previous drinking might have caused some damage.
176015164,Yes that’s correct. I have heard my ex psychiatrist
176015165,You can’t walk without klonopin?
176015166,Medicaid. I’ve called 3 times and they all have said it’s still being processed

176015169,"DMT is a hell of a drug. Please stay away from it. The sad truth is, this is the only reality we have. Maybe there’s more beyond this. Maybe not. But it doesn’t matter. In THIS life, in THIS reality, there are people who care about you. You’re a part of this community now. You belong with us. We build our community by helping and supporting each other in times of need. Right now you need support, and you’ll get it. And one day, a little while from now, someone else will need support and you’ll be in a position of being able to help them. Life means what you want it to mean. I choose it to mean that we help each other survive."
176015170,"So I tried out Huel. I saw adverts for it years ago and thought the concept was really gross. But a couple of friends of mine have used it a lot and told me to try it out - and as I always put on weight, I thought I may as well see what its like. I drink it really casually, like two or three times a week. Its pretty great for breakfast especially if you’re hungover or dehydrated. However, I don’t see myself ever drinking it on a regular basis like many people do. Even once every day is too much for me to do on a permanent basis. But as a filler option to liven up breakfast or lunch its quite nice."
174345558,"Paranoia can be brought by lack of sleep/schizophrenia psychosis. You dont have to have audio or visual hallucinations. Think about the shamans, they used Shrooms for a reason. It can be a scary thing if you cant stop the symptons. The invention of anti-psychotics made people able to counter-act the psychosis/paranoia. My main issue was paranoia not hallucinations. I have more of a thought disorder/psychosis where I fear my own fam. or cant know who to trust. And symptoms make you feel connected to everything because everything is energy at a quantum level but the medication can shut that off if its bothering you but its never permanent."
176015171,"I tend to be on higher doses of everything. The worst, though, was haldol. I was on the 100mg injection every 2 weeks plus 40mg pills every day."

176015175,"No, you can’t wish brain damage on someone. That isn’t a thing."
176015176,"I deal with this in a similar manner. She will not validate you. You must validate yourself. If youve been diagnosed by a doctor and genuinely struggle with the symptoms and Your mother doesn’t believe you or doesnt look at it from a less religious manner, you need to undestand that you cant change her. You have to change your perspective. You can let her get to you or you can learn to turn a pro _NAME_ into a solution. Ask yourself, Do i get mad because i want her to believe me? Do i get mad becuase she is not being practical? Am i getting upset becuase i am allowing her dictate my actions? Validation comes from self. Peace comes from within. You cannot change your mom, only your perspective. You have to show that love you need to your self. You must validate yourself. You must find the way to do that. Only yiu can unlock you."

176015211,it are valid questions though huh… just answer them…
176015212,Don’t take side medicine and supplements with your meds. Ask your dr about them as they might interfere with your meds and supplements/side medicine don’t help SZ and often make it worse. E.g. L-Dopa cause psychosis especially in SZ patients. Change to another stronger antipsychotic? Up your dosage? Not every med work for every patient.

176015233,"Noone can function properly in a state of anxiety, but anxiety is like holding a boulder above your own head and being in imminent danger through no fault of anyone elses. Just put the boulder down, ie. just don’t feel anxious about the future, because you’re right, all we have is the present and within its confines we have the power to exert whatever will we choose, we all have more power than we seem to realize in that. You aren’t trying to live in the present, you are living in the present. The past and the future have come and will come and it will always be that way until the universe collapses in on itself and takes a new form as time advances ever onward, and nothing new will happen because everything that already is is already contained within reality as unmoving unwavering truths. We as humans are meant to discover ourselves by understanding universal truths. Authority doesn’t exist, its a perversion, inferiority doesn’t exist although i feel bad for those that are stuck in that 
trap. Superiority is false too, because no one is truly going to escape from this reality or death. Life is a dance, we are meant to be in a playful flow state when times are good, and we are meant to do our work to the best of our abilities to maintain where we live and what we care about, that’s it. No matter what you believe about yourself, understand that you have an innate purpose as a human being, and it’s no better or worse than anyone else’s purpose no matter what you’re doing, so long as you’re doing what you care about and it feels deep down good. I consider those who desire control to be narcissistic or psychopathic and otherwise sick in the head, as they choose to act against the grain and their developed establishments, they are a comorbidity upon the face of the earth and our only real enemies. We fight this enemy by standing all together, all peace loving people, and taking our best attributes and get to work on de-establishing their games. If we can all refuse to buy their crap, that
’s a start, if more people got into agriculture on the small/medium scale, and if we pooled resources together in order to become co-existent, they’d realize just how much control they really have, but currently we’re being duped by the established methods of dependence on authority. If we can remain peaceful, cooperate instead of compete, we’re golden."

If the US is a dumpster fire, China is a gas chamber. Doesn’t mean I hate Chinese people or Chinese culture. In fact, I love Chinese culture and history, and would love to visit China one day. Just like I would like to visit the US and love US culture. Wouldn’t want to live there though. Also, I don’t get why you Americans can be so sensitive to criticism. Half the world is watching your TV shows and movies. Half the world dreams about moving to the US. You need to grow thicker skin because that nationalism doesn’t look good on you."

174345555,I stopped olanzapine and stayed 6 months on aripiprazole. It was a very difficult period for me as I was under intense anxiety. Now I am back on olanzapine for 9 months and I am better with less anxiety. It depends on the person I think you need to try it and see if it works for you. For me it didn’t work too well I don’t know if I will ever get back as good as I was on Olanzapine the first time The aripiprazole is as effective as Olanzapine for me. (aripiprazole 10mg and olanzapine 7.5mg) The withdrawal was bad I had severe insomnia…

174345557,"Just saw a commercial that was advertising a med called Fanapt. This is the first time I’ve seen a med that was advertised solely for sz. Usually, with meds like Latuda and Vraylar, they advertise them as bipolar meds. But this mentioned “paranoia”, “delusions”, and “hallucinations” as things the med helps with. Anyway, just found it interesting and kind of cool that a commercial on TV would name-drop schizophrenia. Usually a very taboo and stigmatized word."

174345563,That’s the closest thing I’ve experienced that comes close to how schizophrenic psychosis feels I think also realising that at the Time made it drag on even longer About 100 - 200 in the audience in a huge church hall Just with schizophrenia or you feel just like that for months
176015268,Good ideas. I’m sure it just needs more stretching
174345578,"See if they will try Clozapine. If it can’t break you free, likely no med can."
176015269,"You look well. How much weight are each of the dumbells? I’m a bit self-obsessed and maybe a bit of an attention seeker, both attention from others and from myself. Maybe it’s a bit of a histrionic trait, I dunno.

176015272,Make sure you tell your psychiatrist that your still having these “blips”.
176015273,"You definitely don’t want to take something without telling your doctor. Some of these supplements interact with meds, and can cause problems for you.

176015276,"I recently moved into my own apartment, in my new home of Washington state after two decades of unstable and abusive home situations, living either under my mother’s roof in California or my father’s in _NAME_. Both experiences were horrifying and traumatic in different ways. I faced homelessness after a struggle with methamphetamine and morphine addiction. I was on the streets, fresh out of rehab and the psych ward. I moved up into the house of the mother of my partner and best friend of twelve years, in Washington state. We had plans to move out into an apartment together, but I told him I needed to do this alone for a bit. (What’s odd is I felt deeply hurt that he actually acquiesced to this, despite how sad he was. . . I need to work on that.) I saved up some money, got a job, and moved in. But let me tell you. Holy ???? is it hard. I am actually partly bitter at my partner because he actually has a safe family to stay with. I don’t have that luxury that seems like a right. I am on food 
stamps, public health insurance, and struggle to pay my bills. Although I am working on garnering more income, and it is totally possible for me. I’m also bitter because my partner agreed to stay because he said he could save money doing school while living at home. Of course, this is totally unreasonable of me, because it was my decision, but I can’t help what I feel. I want and have always wanted nothing more than to go to ??????? college. I am intelligent and a great student. Anyway. But here’s the main point of this post. The VOICES ARE SO BAD every time I am home. Like I said, I’m alone. And it’s horrible. It’s constant hallucinations. How do I deal with this? I can’t sleep, really. Thanks."

176015279,"Yeah, I’ve been reading up and it seems to be documented well that I’d be likely to abuse it for the sake of escape from perhaps one condition like mood but then end up exacerbating another condition like paranoia or delusion/nonsensical thoughts Thank you for mentioning those aspects of life like studying, cos that’s what I have to focus on the most.

174345575,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Type 1 diabetes mellitus and the risk for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder: a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuro endocrinology letters , Nov 2019 09 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), resulting from an immune-associated destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic ?-cells, has been reported in a few earlier studies to be inversely associated with schizophrenia, but not with schizophrenia-like psychoses. The aim of this study was to verify this finding by carrying out a Swedish register study.Data from the Total Population- and Medical Birth-Registers were used to create a cohort of all individuals born in Sweden 1987-2004. The cohort individuals were linked with the Inpatient- and Outpatient-Registers and followed from birth to 2017 to identify onset of T1DM, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. _PERSON_ proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the association between T1DM and risk of developing schizophrenia o
r schizoaffective disorder during a follow-up from age 13.The study population included 1 745 977 individuals and the length of follow-up was maximally 18.0 (median 9.7) years. During the follow-up, 1 280 individuals developed schizophrenia and 649 individuals schizoaffective disorder. The risk of developing schizophrenia was significantly lower among individuals with, than among individuals without, a diagnosis of T1DM, whereas the risk of developing schizoaffective disorder did not differ among individuals with or without a T1DM diagnosis [adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval); schizophrenia: 0.29 (0.09-0.91), p=0.0338, schizoaffective disorder: 1.50 (0.71-3.16), p=0.2909].This study, in line with previous studies, shows that a diagnosis of T1DM is associated with a decreased risk of schizophrenia. This finding of an inverse association between T1DM and schizophrenia may bring an interesting piece, related to autoimmunity, into the schizophrenia-aetiology puzzle."

I then told the dentist that I’m a survivor of child abuse & took several blows to the face as a result as a kid, damaging my facial bones & jaw and could she please stop talking about blows to the face as it was triggering my childhood abuse. Now, wouldn’t any human being with an ounce of compassion or people skills respect my wishes, have some empathy? Nope, this dentist started crying a

176015412,Thankyou _AT_MENTION_
176015413,_AT_MENTION_ At any time feel free to say stop! Can you explain what your internal vs external voices were like? Were the internal in your voice? I can’t tell the difference necessarily
174345608,"Hi there, welcome to the forum! I stumbled in here 2 and a half years ago and it was one of my best moves recovery-wise. So when I got sick in 2014, I was completely delusional and paranoid for my first two years of the illness, lots of voices and visual hallucinations too. I ended up homeless and then in jail in solitary confinement for 5 months and the guards were not giving me my meds. Went pretty crazy. Funny thing is, after I got out and back on the meds, I started getting better. Within two years I was stable and no longer delusional. I no longer noticed coincidences or thought people could read my thoughts. I still heard voices but I knew to ignore them. Sometimes they were mean, insulting voices that would drive me crazy. However over the last couple years, with medication, the voices have become nice. They compliment me or narrate what I do and are much easier to ignore. So you could get better over time too. You just need to find a good doctor who will work with you to find the best antip
sychotic for your personal body chemistry. For me it was Zyprexa 7.5mg daily, but it varies from person to person. Life isn’t fun when you’re analyzing every coincidence and trying to figure out whether or not you’re the only real person or whether or not you live in a simulation. That type of thinking sucks all the fun out of life, believe me."

I’ve been on just about every medication out there, none of them work completely, but they do help. The negative symptoms get me the most and the meds don’t help with that."

176015437,I just keep thinking of the sz who thought he would get murdered and he did. I’m worried that my delusion will come true. I’m accepting that the clone delusion is just that but still am not over the other one. It’s hard living and staying put with as serious of a threat I am facing even though others say it isn’t true. The gravity of it makes it still very bothersome. It’s all I think about all day. And the fact I didn’t run away to create a life where these things were less likely to happen makes me feel worse.

It takes a while to grasp that what we use to perceive reality, our mind, may be functioning abnormally."

If you go to the doctor, he will completely dumb and pretend like he can’t hear your thoughts and he will try to give you meds. I’m not really sure why they do that,I guess because they don’t know what else to do.Why doctors haven’t tried to look into what is causing this is beyond me. But going to any normal hospital/clinic is completely useless,nobody will help you and they will all play dumb. We must get in touch with neuroscientists who would be interested in “telepathy.” But there is just no traditional way to go about researching our condition.It all starts with a professional actually recognizing our condition and actually attempting to look into w

176015520,I think our environment has a lot of impact on us. My dad used to sleep with a machete under his bed. Put traps up against the door and not eat other people’s cooking. He though a specific race of people were digging holes in the middle of the street on purpose to get his car. I grew up being afraid. Always told if I went out at night I’d be attacked or rode a bike I get run over. My mum on the other hand told me when I was 14 that Lucifer was right beside me and going to marry me. Now she’s completely obsessed with God where she hears him and takes his orders. I reckon if “god” said to jump off a bridge to her then she would.

I notices two things in the above statement, Define what’s good and success for me? I spent few hours going in depth of it. And arrived at this sentence: “If doing nothing is right, the world which is, should have not existed.” Going through my definition of good always inclined to “escape” which actually I was very good at it. Example: Playing badminton, I don’t keep track of score, if I will or lose doesn’t matter, but thats not how a game works. I feel the same thing called a game of life, I have to will or lose either one, if I get injured I will comeback stronger and finish the game that I had started. Its not that I hear bad voices now after meds. Its the way I speak to self. I do hear good things talking to me, but its not something good for long run. I believed my moral of what is good has been hampered or I have the same moral from childhood. No one can have a perfect c
hildhood its impossible. I think its my moral from childhood who was always escaping from opportunity of failure. People always say “Failure is a stepping stone” but I was not ready to fail but gave an excuses of not to fail or compete in something where there is a failure. One can say its black and white thinking and stay neutral. Or With meds challenge stuffs I like, with right morals. Because I have failed and dont even realize I have failed Miserably, escape character say to me I deserve support because of the things I have gone through, so when will I start to play again, “Never”!!! Only thing I do everyday is just breathe for hope, saying that today I see the 1% good in me and try to add on by understanding: “If doing nothing is right, the world which is, should have not existed.” I am going to continue and play the game called life. Am I Good? There is no such thing as a secure life. “It does not exist in nature … Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” From A Book - Life Witho

The general rule of thumb is basically if you want to be a better person and or are worried about not being able to feel -you’re not a sociopath. To contradict all that I said -I agree, I think we all fall somewhere on the anti social spectrum to a degree.

174345653,I’ve spent so much time trying to find out why the schizophrenia happened. I have vilified members of my family and attacked other people in print over this. Yet in a way there is a dysfunction throughout my life in my abilities compared to my normal brothers. If you want to find how my dysfunctional family affected them you can see my twin occasionally eating an entire box of Oreos at one sitting or my younger brother’s ample liquor cabinet. Yet even that may have been in their DNA and it hasn’t kept them from being functional and very effective human beings. Our upbringing had dysfunction in it with 2 divorces and some abuse from one of our stepfathers but the difference between me and my brothers was likely bad luck when I was born due to genetics rather than something that happened later on. My Mother also is a very capable person who always was there and was a strong steady influence through very difficult times. And as far as the genetics goes the schizophrenia appeared in my Uncle after 
we were born and it’s likely no one knew what the genetic possibilities were anyway. As it is my nieces are more than likely to be normal and one or two of them are likely to remain geniuses who go well beyond that. It’s that tradeoff that happens sometimes in families like mine. The most effective people have the least effective relatives. In my little World at least life may be more fair than you think.

174345660,"Yes paranoid schizophrenia for about 5 years ago. I take medications, go to the psychiatrist, go to therapist. And STILL i am experiencing universal truths being spoken to me by entities from higher dimensions. I am completely lucid, i am completely functional (most days), i understand what is happening to me even though most people are made quite unintact by their experiences. I understand that some delusions i have experienced as tests of morality, faith, love, etc. I see my existence as one of necessity and aliens are a huge part of my life. I understand that there are good, bad, and indifferent entities. It wasnt up until recently that i realized that these tests are necessary to proving my character and my heart to the higher beings as our existence of humanity is in jeopardy. I want to save everyone, i am in direct contact with my spirituality, and spirits of higher authority in our universe. We are on the brink of extinction. If but one human can prove themselves through all the tests they a
re put through, then we are all saved. This is called Christ conciousness. No i do not think i am Jesus. I do however identify with Jesus as savior of mankind, providing his life, body, mind, soul as sacrifice for all of our sins. This has already been done. Now it is time to prove it in the end, whatever more tests they throw at me, however many times i have to lose touch with this reality to save us all, I will do it."

176015605,Neither. You’re identifying with those labels because you’re hurt. I do the same at times. It helps us in some way - or it feels like it does. We all ‘act’ in accordance with something that we feel is painful to us. But in ‘acting out’ we sort of rescue ourselves from that pain. Delusions and hallucinations are like rescuers from experiencing some unpleasant reality we might be living in and feel we can’t escape from. That’s the truth as far as I have seen it. And you know what they say? The truth will set you free… If you want it to.

R _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, R Isohookana and _PERSON_, Community mental health journal , Sep 28 2019 Our aim was to examine whether ACEs associate to regular smoking and nicotine dependence (ND) among 508 psychiatric inpatients aged 13-17 years. Adolescents were interviewed using the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children and the European Addiction Severity Index -instruments. ND was measured with the modified Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire. In girls, all violent ACEs (domestic violence, physical abuse at home, sexual abuse) were related to regular smoking and some family-related ACEs (parental divorce and substance use problems) both to regular smoking and ND. After controlling for covariates, girls with parental substance use had an increased likelihood for being a regular smoker and having ND. Greater number of ACEs 
in girls indicated higher level of ND. Corresponding associations were not observed in boys. Our findings suggest that girls after experiencing ACEs are more prone to becoming smokers and developing ND already in adolescence compared to boys."

We visited this year in June and everything went fine. I plan on visiting my barber again while I’m there."

176015632,When I was planning my life I needed to ask myself if I was serious because I really wasn’t. I also expected people to suffer for me which caused me guilt and withdrawal. I didn’t want to suffer alone. I was hurt and angry. I now recognize the motive behind my strange behaviors.
176015633,"Your eyes are like cameras. They “film” everything around you. Your eyes are connected to the brain by the optic nerve. This nerve travels to the occipital lobe of the brain, which is at the back of you head. The occipital lobe then decodes messages from the optic nerve and gives you the ability to “see”."
174345681,"Honestly, in the opinion of many doctors, absolutely nothing. I read somewhere that they’re thinking of making the diagnostic criteria more specific, or even removing it altogether. I don’t know how true that is, but it’s not surprising. Some doctors say that schizophrenia itself is a systemic illness, suggesting that emotional dysregulation is actually a symptom of schizophrenia and not indicative of a cooccurring mood disorder."

Because of it, I was always directing anger at myself. This is why I don’t wish my CPTSD on anyone. My PTSD tends to be complex and it causes a lot of problems as to self esteem. _AT_MENTION_ I am so sorry that you endured the same thing. Some mothers just don’t know how to deal with things. Abuse is so horrible. It also caused my sz too and a lot of it is connected with my abuse. I hope you are doing a lot better than before."

176015664,I dont think so. but they do.
176015665,"The truth no one will want to mention is that we will subconsciously choose to stop feeling when we encounter something painful that we don’t know how to deal with/won’t accept. This is especially true if something like jealousy/envy occurs and it turns into self-hate. Or we feel like we’re powerless/hopeless/helpless to change something or acquire something. After that, our subconscious controls most of our outside actions and convinces us that we just don’t know why we can’t feel or why we behave in certain ways. Then, ‘addiction’ (a surface symptom) appears and we can’t seem to understand it or how it formed and why it’s there. It just seems ‘there’ without cause. Nothing is ever cause-less in this place. Unless you want to adopt a mystical-ey type of mentality. Which… is just yet another coping mechanism that occurs to cover the painful feelings. Oh yeah. Don’t expect anyone to be honest about this. Most of us our too busy coping too - you know?.. And can you expect an
yone not to continue coping when we don’t even know we’re doing that?.."

174345693,"It’s super hard to deal with negative symptoms. It’s a symptom of SZ that is made only worse by anti-psychotics. The only things that help negative symptoms are anti depressants and stimulants. Anti depressants because they release serotonin and make you happy, therefore motivated to do stuff. Stimulants because they give you a temporary boost of energy. Nothing else will help, trust me."
176015697,"Chlorpromazine/Thorazine, the first AP discovered accidentally in the 50’s was called at that time “chemical lobotomy” by pdocs because it had the same effect that lobotomy on patients.

It’ s all about disconnecting overactivated frontal lobe. The difference is that psychosurgery is definitive whereas medication are transient."

176015723,Super interested in the flying dust part. I started noticing particles which I assumed to be dust at first and maybe it is? _PERSON_ doing Reading research On scientific theories / physics I found descriptions that seemed to explain a couple experiences. One was seeing a type of mist smoke filling up the corner of the bedroom as it had times before as well as other houses. I had an intuition to hold my hand just over where the light part/ bulb was and then the whole perception of mist/ smoke disappeared over and over? Later /. A couple weeks later I happened upon the photoelectric effect and it seemed to explain what I was perceiving possibly? Then weeks later I saw the little particles going in and out of the same lamp as if it were an entry / exit or portal. A couple weeks after that I read about quantum tunneling and it seemed like a bit of a stretch but maybe in the ball park of what I experienced. I’ve been having allot of experiences with the dust and if In the bathroom with the right natura
l light there’s hundreds of them. Then of course if I dust myself of it’s like a snow storm of particles. Weird thing is I’ve been noticing how they hover around me without ever needing to give in to falling with gravity… they hover waiting to come back on me. Last thing. I had my set of singing bowls out on the bed and perceived the dust particles so I decided to experiment as I usually do since I started being able to see energy and resonance effects from People and object. I tried different things including some crystals. Little had effect with the dust intermingling with me until I took out my larger black tourmaline reiki wand and as I saw what ever part of my energy body / Aura strength it seemingly created a wall and the dust seemingly barricaded by the wall. Black tourmaline is / has piezoelectric qualities as well as claims of it helping with blocking emf. The emf part I wasn’t sure about until watching a YouTube video with a guy emf detecting with his hand held detector showing his pc moni
tor reading at 8. Something then immediately putting a smaller chunk of black tourmaline under the center of the monitor and bringing back detector and it dropped about 3 points on the detector. Interesting I thought. Other things have happened but this is already long to read. Can I ask what you’ve noticed ?
176015724,I could probably get one. That’s a good idea.
176015725,So I’ve been getting these thought/voices in my head saying I’m stupid dumbass idiot kinda things but there’s also ones calling me a crackhead methhead and the like that just arent true.

To be honest they never really paid me back, or paid me in the first place. Kind of ?????? up if you ask me. But anyways, I got psychotic later on and I looked back at my yearbook and saw that. And I was no genius and I still aren’t by any means. Most of all I try to stay humble these days. But I don’t think I’m an idiot.

176015755,Welcome to the forum.
176015756,I still have hopes for my future because I believe in low doses of medication to be used…( if your illness is not that severe ) if I had to stay on invega then I would say my future is to look bleak… some people need a heavier drug and dose which is sad… I don’t think I’m one of those people but I’m still early days in my recovery so we’ll have to see… it all depends on how severe your illness is and how much symptoms you can learn to handle… I personally think that most schizos should live with a certain amount of symptoms in order to be on a low dose of medication and function… some however can not do this and to those who can’t I am sorry…

174345722,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Differential associations between impaired autobiographical memory recall and future thinking in people with and without schizophrenia. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, The British journal of clinical psychology , Oct 2019 04 The ability to think about future events serves a range of important functions. People with schizophrenia show impairments in future thinking. However, whether these impairments are specific to positive or negative events and to what extent they are associated with impairments in verbal fluency and autobiographical memory remains poorly understood.People with schizophrenia (n = 93) and people without psychiatric diagnoses (n = 111) were asked to generate future events and retrieve past autobiographical events and they also completed a test of verbal fluency. Participants also completed questionnaire measures of the positive and negative dimensions of schizophrenia and depression symptoms.People with schizophrenia generated significantly fewer positive an
d negative future events than controls. In a linear regression, the interaction between diagnosis and autobiographical memory retrieval explained a significant amount of variance in the number of future events that participants generated even when accounting for symptoms and verbal fluency. Past and future thinking abilities were correlated in controls but not in people with schizophrenia.People with schizophrenia may not rely on autobiographical content to imagine the future and may rely instead on semantic processes. Interventions that improve past and future thinking amongst people with schizophrenia are warranted.Compared to control participants, people with schizophrenia have marked difficulty generating possible, positive and negative, future events. Unlike controls, for people with schizophrenia there is no relation between their ability to remember past events and their ability to think about the future. People with schizophrenia may have difficulty using their memories for their past to imagine and s
imulate possible future events."

174345726,"First of all, I do not recommend coming off of prescribed medication on your own. Many times, the reason a person is feeling well is largely due to the medication working as intended. Stopping the medication can have repercussions, often times not in the first day or even in the first week. It can take anywhere from 3 weeks to 6 months before experiencing symptoms again after being off meds for that amount of time. Speaking from personal experience, the other thing that can happen is that just when people are beginning to accept you as a lucid and coherent person again, if you should experience symptoms, that could push them away again. Anyway, with all that being said, there is such a thing called “residual schizophrenia”. Usually, people diagnosed with schizophrenia who have lived without incident for ten years or more (often older patients) are the ones who are diagnosed with that. Honestly, I’ve only ever met two people with that diagnosis and both were doing fairly well in terms of holdi
ng a job and maintaining an acceptable place in modern society. One was a man in his early sixties, the other was a woman in her late 40’s. It’s been over half a decade since I found this article. I actually found more than a few some years ago. Anyway, once in awhile, I read it again just to keep some hope alive that one day I can live a life without medication. One time, my acting psychiatrist gave me a chance to do so. I did well for about 18 months, then slowly regressed into a deluded reality. Last time I spoke with the psychiatrist he asked why I decided to go back on medication. I told him it is because they made life easier. I’ve been off meds for a few months now again. So far I’ve been okay. Not perfect and not as much improvements in being more productive and social than last time I tried living off of medication but I’m trying. One thing I have to absolutely mention is that if your psychiatrist gives you a chance to try life off of medication… STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. I mean a
bsolutely NO ILLICIT DRUGS AND NO ALCOHOL. I’m not against beer or even marijuana for that matter but as a person with a mental condition off of medication, I avoid anything that could alter my mind state. That and use all your coping strategies, methods, techniques whenever you feel any symptoms or are feeling upset. Also NEVER PHYSICALLY HARM ANYONE INCLUDING YOURSELF. Also one more thing, learn to love yourself. I mean that. Accept who you are as a person whether on medication or off medication, symptomatic or not, you are still a person at the end of the day but you have to accept yourself as a person who is unique in the way the brain works. That doesn’t mean to feel lesser or superior than other people. Even regular people struggle. We might struggle with things that others feel are trivial, for example using public transportation can be stressful with strangers around sometimes having conversations about whatever. I mean using public transportation is a mundane thing for regular people. Sometimes d
uring the first few days it was a little rough, but I saw it as a sort of adventure. Taking a shower can feel like a chore, but you have to take care of your hygiene even more so when off of medication. Here is the article… chicagotribune.com Study finds some schizophrenics do well without long-term antipsychotics UIC professor _NAME_ found that after 5 years, schizophrenia patients who were no longer taking antipsychotics were actually doing better than those who still were, perhaps because they had been less ill to begin with So in short, if you are to try life without medication, speak to your psychiatrist about it. My advice is don’t go for the “I want to be off of medication now.” talk. Instead ease your way into it, ask if you’ve showed signs of improvement. Stay with treatment for at least a year or two without any involuntary psychiatric holds, and then maybe you can talk about reducing the dose. Really don’t expect it to be from one month to another. Now the most important things for bein
g schizophrenic and off of medication… NO ILLICIT DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. (I even avoid caffeine and nicotine now.) DO NOT PHYSICALLY HARM ANYONE INCLUDING YOURSELF. PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE. Other important things: Try to be productive or do something to improve who you are as a person. Practice having patience. Try to be a good person, do not be afraid to show sympathy for people with or without a mental illness. Be kind to yourself, accept that there are things that difficult for us that are not for others, don’t let it bring you down. This one is important in many rehabilitation programs, remember you are only ever really in control of yourself, do not lose control because of emotions. Because we are diagnosed as having a mental illness, no matter what there will be moments in which even if you have been wronged, it will not matter, you will still be at fault if the situation escalates. cough Practice patience. Anytime there is a slip, at least one person close to you will say, “It is probably because you ar
e not taking your medication.” Or “Please take your medicine.” If I had a dollar for every time I heard that, I’d be able to afford dinner at Red Lobster. Remember, when off of medication you have to do your best mentally not to get upset, anytime you do there will likely be someone who will say it is because you are off your meds. Instead of lashing out, take it as an introspective moment. Think of what you did that brought that comment. Don’t lose your cool and instead take it as a learning experience to not make any similar mistakes. Even if you were wronged and made a retort, don’t retort next time. Take it in stride. Lastly, and I think this is probably the most important one… DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP FROM A TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL SUCH AS A DOCTOR OR PSYCHIATRIST. Even if you are off meds if the symptoms become too difficult, get help. I can only recommend a person come off medication with the approval of a medical professional. So far this time around I’m not making as much 
progress as I was last time I was off of medication. Last time around, I enrolled in college classes again, I was living independently, using public transportation, buying my own groceries, and toilet paper… hah… you know the things normal people do? I’d even make my bed. I also lost a lot of weight. This time around I haven’t enrolled in college or gone out much, but I’ve tried with baby steps I guess. Well, I still have much to improve. So long as I continue on my path to self improvement, I think I’m doing okay."

I always felt like different people sitting at different tables would try and heckle me in order to get answers and stories from me. I got used to it and comfortable.

This study examines the proportion of people with substance-induced psychoses who transition to schizophrenia, compares this to other brief and atypical psychoses, and examines moderators of this risk. A search of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Embase identified 50 eligible studies, providing 79 estimates of transition to schizophrenia among 40 783 people, including 25 studies providing 43 substance-specific estimates in 34 244 people. The pooled proportion of transition from substance-induced psychosis to schizophrenia was 25% (95% CI 18%-35%), compared with 36% (95% CI 30%-43%) for brief, atypical and not otherwise specified psychoses. Type of substance was the pr

Lower rates were reported for opioid (12%), alcohol (10%) and sedative (9%) induced psychoses. Transition rates were slightly lower in older cohorts but were not affected by sex, country of the study, hospital or community location, urban or rural setting, diagnostic methods, or duration of follow-up. Substance-induced psychoses associated with cannabis, hallucinogens, and amphetamines have a substantial risk of transition to schizophrenia and should be a focus for assertive psychiatric intervention."

176015948,"Hey Bvf, glad you’re feeling well. I do feel a better piece of mind but in terms of my mood it is very low. Like I’m sleeping to escape my low mood Don’t get me wrong when I binge on junk I also get a lower mood but it is of a different type. I find it very hard to live with my mother because we clash. She is very depressed and struggles with food cravings like me and it kind of triggers me. I can’t wait to move out. I’m hoping that when quarantine is over I’ll struggle less. But overall it is going OK. I’m still adjusting i think. At least I haven’t binged on junk which is totally awesome I just feel like can I keep this up? Idk … And well done for maintaining an eating style that suits you :)!!!"

176015950,"I told at my last job to explain frequent absences and my then-supervisor was far less than supportive. I had taken a three week short-term disability to attend a crisis program. All she kept saying was, “well, your doctor cleared you to return to work…” I kept saying that he shouldn’t have done that, but all she cared about was that. We rarely communicated during my second short-term disability. When I was going on long-term disability (and losing my job since they were no longer required to hold it open for me), I went in to clean out my desk and all she said to me was, “well, you LOOK fine!” People just don’t get it. I don’t recommend making your illness common knowledge."
176015951,"That’s how I used to be before I started taking adderall. I’d be scared of SUVs thought they were following me. I also thought I heard whispers in my apartment. One time in the daytime some guy with sunglasses came knocking on my door and that really made me paranoid. I’d be scared of cars through my apartment window–thought it meant something. This was all minor compared to what I feel now. It feel 100% (well for the most part) that they will take me away. And I’m not quite sure what to do about it. Before I thought it was moving away from where I was. I heard a voice say it would be harder as you get older. Now I feel like it’s harder since I’m not sure what to do. But that’s not really older older, it’s only been 6 months since I heard this. But still there’s no clarity what to do next."

The deal is I’m kinda perfectionistic and want to make a good impression at any cost. I get embarrassed at even minor mistake like making some mess or spilling a bit of coffee. I also lived in social isolation for a long time, so in a social place like this I get shy and anxious."

And then I have positive feelings and I try to be positive. Outdoor activities such as riding my bicycle help me to feel much better. Often some paranoid delusions cause more depression, but I understand this and I try to be optimistic. I talk to my mother often on the phone and this communication helps me too.

174345769,"I might have autism according to my psychologist. I have done a few tests online and she might have a point. Me and my mother had a massive argument yesterday as my diagnosis might not be right and I blame the NHS for misdiagnosing me for years. I am not sure if I should continue taking antipsychotics, as I have been mis treated, I have been up much of the night worrying about this. If they have got it so wrong and I have gone through so much social pain with no support then I should be very angry that this wasn’t considered sooner. I honestly don’t know what to think. I have lived with Schizophrenia for years with no one questioning it, and now someone is paying close attention, it turns out I may be autistic instead. I don’t know what to do.

176015989,"Height is between 60 and 80 per cent genetic. So called “Hobbits” (if that is not a derogatory term) were amongst the first humans in the far East and still do in some isolated communities. Ethiopians were said to be the tallest humans according to Herodotus and the longest lived. Scientists are still interested in reverting to child like proportions or cultivating giants. However such research is still in its infancy with only minor historical and contemporary experiments in foot binding and high heels. In recent years, owing to false ideas about breeding, pornographers have taken up the challenge in search of profit, which is not what science is about. Breast implants, penis extension, and the like are big earners and all part of the arms trade which I am against. Foot binding is thankfully a thing of the past, but high heels remain fashionable to some. The crossing of humans with octopuses seems like the future to many biologists, allowing us to change shape at will and communicate with pigm
ents, but is wholly against the natural laws of mother nature. Economists, both green and blue, still argue over the merits of growth with some suggesting we should aim to reverse it. It is a fact that there are too many people in the world for life in general to be sustainable, though many of us still have faith in reproduction. Africa produces the most children, but uses the fewest resources, whilst America produces the fewest, but uses the most. Platform shoes are making a comeback as trainers, but still mostly for women. I am not sure what the answer to all this is other than to mind my own business. Britain is a nation of shop keepers after all. Thank you."
174345777,"Recently I find it harder and harder to be alone. I need to constantly be around friends, support groups, day treatment, with my mom, on this forum, or writing to myself in my journal. I can’t handle any introverted activity, though I was born an introvert. I turn to dark thoughts, can’t concentrate well on movies and books, or even do the laundry. My dark thoughts revolve around death, wanting to get married but not knowing when that’ll be, my cousin’s cancer, purposelessness, the absence of artistic outlets due to negative symptoms, my health, even small things like my weight, anxiety, and being underemployed and not being busy enough. But I recently just yesterday I started listening to old indie music playlists, and it’s bringing out my painful feelings and letting me confront them and I feel that feeling like I do drinking wine or having a good cry and just feeling like it’s that missing piece I really needed. I think listening to these playlists have helped me confront myself. Oth
er activities that speak to me in an introverted way are visiting the art museum, watching a good movie, watching sci fi or anime (related to the death), watching travel documentaries about Japan, reading comedy genre manga, drinking tea or eating something, meditation and bedtime stories, reading the news and Facebook feeds on my phone, and choosing fragrances at the store. What are introverting activities that make you happy?"

The voices happen mostly at night, and if I can distract myself by being busy and being with people it usually helps, but mostly I just try to get home and hide out. I feel so foreign here, like “my people” just dumped me out of a spaceship and left. Even small things like taking a shower seem like a big feat sometimes. I’m doing pretty well these days though, all things considered, I have a (very part time, work from home) job, and I’ve even tried to go to a book study this week.

Now that she has money and will have a place to stay, maybe it’s time to set boundaries and rules and take a stand and tell her she got lucky this time and things are going to work out, but tell her if there’s a next time, where she blows-up and loses housing and screams and expects help, that she is on her own. You might even tell her that old saying if she makes the same mistakes and gets kicked out, “You made your bed, now you have to lay in it.” You ain’t a bank and your house should not have a revolving door."

It is a strong medicine though and I heard it can be hard to get off of once you’ve been on it for a while (mind being chemically dependent on the drug). If I could switch from invega to paxil I would. It’s the lesser of two evils. I would not recommend taking both paxil and a AP at the same time though unless your docter knows what he’s doing.

Like those neighbours of mine who throw pebbles at my window and scream insults, because they don’t like what I say about them when delusional.

176016068,"Hi everyone, I’m seeing shadows that look like bats out of the corner of my eyes, the animal not the sports tool. I was wondering if anyone else has experience this? I recently posted that I’ve only ever had one vivid visual hallucination, but now I’m seeing bats all of a sudden. My question is, should I immediately jump to psychosis or could there be other reasons I’m seeing stuff out of the corner of my eye? I think everyone sees shadows out of the corner of their eye every once in a while, but this is more vivid and ots constant. I’ll talk to my pdoc about it but I’m scared to have my license taken away. I dont think it will impact my driving, but I guess that’s her decision."

176016070,You are on a non mental illness forum. You have a good record of participation . For some reason you mention you have a mental illness. After doing so you are then criticised far more than you were before mentioning you have a mental illness.

I dont know anyone thats got it, without the support from the CMHT. They wont just take your word for it. You will always need a MH Professional to back you up. They had the personal number of my social worker at the time - and they rang up to confirm that i had Schizophrenia. Never been to a medical in 20 years either. You really need a support worker, willing to write letters and make phone calls to the DWP in my experience."

My theory is we are trapped in a simulation and we are stuck in a ‘primitive or caveman’ culture while they are continuing advancing on us. I’ve been through it all millions of times. I feel like I have a wealth of information under my belt, but I was given schizophrenia on purpose, and it feels like punishment. It’s been going on for eternity, pretty much.

176016120,From sleep deprivation I saw some famous dead musicians walk out of this curtain that was hanging in a doorway. Then a living musician walked out and I said “hey! you’re not dead.” and passed out. And one time I saw a Native American head with head dress coming out of the wood grain pattern on a wooden door. It was 3d and kept moving in all directions. It was so real I felt I could’ve put my hand out to touch it. When I was given ketamine recently I hallucinated that the roof was pulling off the top of the building and the light from the heavens above was glowing through. I also thought the doctors face melted off.

176016122,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m so glad you’re reacting so positively to naltrexone. While I’ve not taken it, I know someone who has.

176016127,Yeah I took it for anxiety but man it makes you put on weight
174345802,"You mean the feeling of blank mind or the torture? The blank mind does not bring necessarily any particular feeling, no “emptiness” or “void” feeling. Although right now it placed a feeling of “emptiness” in my head, as if just to show it can do it. An empty box is a good comparison - it’s just empty and that’s it. But you can’t tell from the outside it’s empty, just as you couldn’t tell my mind is empty just from looking at me - my body walks around, talks, and does other things just like any normal person, when it has to. Somehow it manages to do it without any thoughts, though. Maybe they are just hidden from me. Regarding the torture I used to get before, I’d describe it as a strong, unbearable feeling. My body would move as soon as I felt it, to apparently remedy the feeling. “Pure torture” would be a good name for it. My “schizophrenia” can combine it with other feelings though, normally it felt kind of like a burning sensation. One time it combined it with the 
feeling of hotness (it was a fake hotness, which was also produced by my schizophrenia; it sometimes does it when I’m under a blanket in the bed) to create a feeling you could describe as “hotness from hell”. I stood up from the bed as soon as I felt it, and then it disappeared. The torture was a sign from that “schizophrenia” that I’ve been lying/sitting/standing still for too long, and it was the thing that forced me to walk every day until it was time to go to bed again. I’ve no idea why it wanted me to walk all day long every day. Even during walking it would add some of that torture to my body, although it was more in the background then. Walking faster did not help."

174345810,"What are some great strategies for disorganized thought? I have had this issue since I was around twelve years old. I used to make unwanted word salad all the time, even for the picnics. My word salad has dissipated. I still struggle with some things. My thought process has always been funny. I think my disorganized thoughts are from depression since I do not have schizophrenia but I do psychosis from bipolar. As for how I am now, I have been accused of being contradicting myself and being incoherent despite not seeing the issue. I am told that I do not answer questions properly, despite me not seeing the problem. I embark on tangents uncontrollably. People tell me that I am not doing something properly and I do not see what they are going on about. I always found that my thought process was very rapid and unique for as long as I could remember."

176016146,"I like beer a lot. I used to drink early in the evening and then take olanzapine at night. But even then I could feel that the alcohol interacted with the meds.

176016152,I think we are affected by both changes in the environment and changes in how we perceive our environment. I get the same thing. and the solution is working on your fears and paranoias I think. whatever they may be. if you can find a way to healthily deal with your fears and paranoias then your subjective reality will correspondingly change too I need to work on this too. for example I feel like my friends don’t want to be around me and so I distance myself from them. I feel ‘dirty’ and rubbish because of my awful eating habits. and other things. means i cant enjoy myself around my friends. so I just need to work on that stuff so that when I am around them my subjective reality changes. at the end of the day if my subjective reality is bad then it will leak into the objective reality too of the people I am around irl.

176016199,I was an avid and eclectic reader in my teens. At that time I thought not being able to visualise was the norm . Thus there was no sense of missing out on anything. It took guided imagery sessions for anxiety over 15 years ago to make me realise how wrong that was . Other people were having a positive response to it while I was not. After that I was fully aware that there was something missing for me when it came to the reading experience. Though much more so fiction than non fiction wise.

Suggesting you work with your treatment team and take meds as directed, even if they’re uncomfortable at first. They need to knock the worst of the positive symptoms down and then they can start fine-tuning. Sending you the best vibes I can, been where you are and it’s a struggle for sure. Things do get better!"

176016214,Yeah I don’t super duper agree with the way they diagnose. Even this linked test seemed woefully outdated and inaccurate. Every question about using the phone is irrelevant now that 90% of communication between friends/family happens via text message.

174345825,These are symptoms of schizophrenia. You need to tell your psychiatrist that you’re still having these problems. He might switch you to a different medication which could suit you better. Maybe even Clozapine.
174345820,"This issue is still very important to me. I got into an argument with my mother over it again, who still thinks it’s real. None of her arguments hold, except two. Her coughing blood for years. Supposedly as part of a continuous exorcism ritual. Apparently she did visit doctor over it but obviously it was fruitless. Choked it up to consequences of tuberculosis, from what I understood. We are poor and crazy so if you squint you can explain it with some complications of that sort but it’s still strange and disgusting. There are a lot of people involved, I am not sure how to count them. Strictly there are four total that share delusions, three of them related by blood. Others helped fuel this nonsense, but it could be explained with superstition, at least most of it. This land is furtile for mystifisticism. She communicates with another person who shares her delusions via Web and phone. From what I hear they rarely actually match, predictably, but it still annoys me. Were she sane I could have had 
more real help than shallow advices and exorcist rituals. Ironically, both of them work and I can’t finish a simple textbook."

174345826,I actually feel the opposite. I like it when I go pick up my meds at the pharmacy Because I kinda want them to think “wow this guy has schizophrenia?? But he looks so normal. And he is polite”. Basically I hope to break any stereotypes around the disease
176016222,What’s a flag? Is that like someone reporting you or something?

Never knew if Abilify’s blurry vision is permanent. Latuda is different and didn’t have side effects while on it other than nausea. I am now on Risperdal and its the best for me.

It all escalated into me believing in telepathy and some cosmic plot with angels demons and aliens. I became a messianic figure etcetera. What you’re going through is classic schizophrenia. I’ve seen a lot of people on this forum post like this. I’ll try to find a link to another discussion I had with someone similar to this. Whatever you do do NOT get violent, you will end up in jail like happened to me.

My current med, rexulti, doesn’t give me side effects at all and never did. TD really only develops after long term antipsychotic use, it is not really an issue that shows up right away. Fortunately the chance of developing it is much much lower with newer antipsychotics compared to the older generation ones. The older generation you were guaranteed to get TD on pretty much."

My current pdoc has always let me suggest medication to try, I’ve failed on alot of meds, but currently I’m doing very well.

Moreover, we estimate discontinuation/non-compliance rates at 30 to 45% in the acute phase treatment and up to 74% in the long-term treatment of stable schizophrenia patients. Our phase 2 data shows that brilaroxazine potentially can mitigate the negative side effects of current treatments and ultimately that would hopefully improve patient’s compliance to the treatment.”"

I always thought that was strange or cool. My grandfather did stuff like that. But now, I just got delusions and get delusions from my thoughts. I don’t have a lot of common sense or intelligence anymore."
176016464,It’s bizarre because when I was 19 and didn’t know what was wrong with me I said to myself “I wish I was alcoholic or something then at least it would have a name”.

176016477,"It’s kind of a red flag for me when a therapist doesn’t take insurance.

174345877,"Just bought my valerian root and kava kava root today. I finally got home at around 1p.m. central that’s when I took the valerian root. I didn’t take the kava kava. It seems to be working like a charm. The terrible feeling still comes over me. But instead of not being able to move as the terrible feeling comes, I can still move. I find myself checking to see if I’ve lost my ability to move every time the terrible feeling starts progressing in my head. I then move around and find myself completely able. But that’s just from using it once. This is like a journal entry from using it once who knows what’ll happen when I use it throughout the week. I’m not going to take the kava kava root for now. I’m just going to take the valerian root. It seems to be doing just fine. This is why I love the internet. Searching the internet for a scientific peer reviewed treatment for schizophrenia has found me nothing but gems. If valerian root works as good as it does for me right now for my catatonia t

But now I have husband and got to control myself I had imaginary friends since I was 13 till up to 22 years old. They were mostly pictures of famous people I pretended I was in love with and I treated them like boyfriends or therapists etc. When I got better in 2007 I left that behind but became religious and spoke to pictures of Jesus and _NAME_ and St _NAME_.

176016493,I feel like I’m falling apart too. I’m “only” 50.
176016494,I started getting suicidal thoughts in 2005. I started getting them more often in 2015. Sometimes I want to die to escape this world but I’m too scared to ever kill myself.
176016495,Maybe you could get them certified as therapy animals and keep them. I don’t know what the laws are in Canada. I know a couple people who live in apartments that don’t allow animals that are allowed to keep their pets as therapy animals.

176016497,what is that MAO?

176016510,Congrats _AT_MENTION_!
174345897,"In my case I got worse whenever I fought my diagnosis. I fought it for 8 years, stopped my meds with the help of my pdr and got psychotic nearly died. I accepted my diagnosis 2 years ago. I feel much better on meds and I think most ppl do. Positive symptoms are worse than negative symptoms. I can live with negatives but not positives, positives make me homicidal and suicidal."
176016511,NAC improves dopamine in brain. Dopamine helps in motor function thus helps to reduce stiffness related to low dopamine (seen in parkinson). Taurine act bit like magnesium and yes it too help to relax muscles and also relaxes mind.

176016515,"Sometimes I have, mostly it’s casual like comments, and they say something like “Put some more salt” (when cooking a meal). Those command type sayings have no purpose, though, because the voices seem to control my body, so I end up doing what they say anyway - except when they just want to threaten me, not act. Actually the voices probably don’t directly control my body, there’s apparently something that controls both the voices and my body, which is how the voices can tell what my body is about to do. More often there is no command, and they simply say a statement like “We’re going shopping now”, and my body goes shopping in this case. *I don’t seem to be able to control my body; I feel my body is moving by itself. Even this text is written by that “thing”, on behalf of me and from my perspective."

176016524,"I rattled around in my own apartment for 11 years before deciding to move to group living.

It’s not. And there were painful re-entry adjustments to make."

176016533,"I’ll put in my two cents and say that “outbreaks” of salmonella or other diseases that food can cause, are not happening a lot and when they do happen, they are usually caught and taken care of swiftly. Probably more people are killed by lightening or die of bee stings or bitten by sharks or get killed jaywalking each year than die from these occasional food borne diseases. I’m just using examples to make a point, I have no idea how many people are killed each year by the examples I listed. I’m just trying to say that an outbreak happens, a recall is given and afterward it is perfectly safe to go back to eating whatever fruit or vegetable you like. If you have bought already or have on hand any food that has any chance of being contaminated than throw it out but it will be safe to buy and eat again soon. These outbreaks are not permanent; after the contamination is eradicated you will see grocery stores selling broccoli or apples or carrots once again because it’s safe . So yeah, with t
his broccoli thing, hopefully no one will die; but broccoli will be back on the shelves again soon and it will be safe. To play it safe, any produce you buy in a store should always be washed before you consume it."
176016534,"Oh no, this psychiatrist got to court as well the nurses for this procedure. Someone got killed as he was medical impaired and died when they pushed him on the floor. That is the point as a patient you have no chance. Of course it’s to easy to say the patient was out of it. You just confirming that some mental patients like me are on their own. No-one speaks or will speak up for me."
176016535,I’d agree. It’s a marathon. I do better than most but it still has taken a lot of work to get here now. Changes in dosages and meds. Trying things. It all is part of the process. Sounds like your in a good place _AT_MENTION_ . I’m happy you are doing so well.

176016567,Usually people hit the system and it’s there or there abouts. It is a lot about the skills of the shrinks and medical professionals. For me it was all rather obvious to everyone but me. Things like ocd and depression can lead to similar things with differences that a good shrink will have an idea of. In reality it’s not uncommon for diagnosis to change over time due to symptoms and medication changes. It’s a pretty fluid system.

Glad you have meds just in case of anxiety- found out about benadryl through a pharmacist actually. This was when I needed something after a welbutrin ordeal where I was close to going to the hospital after taking it. It sedated and helped me sleep through a nightmarish situation for a few days and during that time I noticed my legs weren’t trying to take over my body lol.

174345917,"I think they are getting louder because there must have been something wrong with my Invega Sustenna injection and I think it was a dud. I’ve had another shot that was a dud once and I don’t know if it’s because the shot was administered wrong, the shot was faulty, or my body is just developing a tolerance to it. Mine talk independently of my thoughts sometimes and the things they say are so mean that sometimes I believe it can’t be originating from my mind. But most of the time they just have cookie cutter phrases on whatever I’m thinking about at the moment. Were they just telling you a story or did you have a delusion of a huge story?"

174345905,"Try L-theanine. Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of L-theanine on glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neuropsychiatrica , Oct 2015 Glutamatergic dysfunction in the brain has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was 
added to the patients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect."

174345913,"Hello, I had been struggling with my weight on Xeplion injection and at my heaviest was about 108-110kg (238-242lbs). My last injection of 100mg of Xeplion was in 17.10.2019. Just to note that i was eating heavily when i was 110kg and if i ate only little i was maybe about 103kg. After that i started on Abilify 15mg and dieting and here are my results so far: 1.12.: had a nasty cough flu and my weight was around 103kg 7.1.: weight loss had been a fight, first you lose weight then you gain it back, 100kg 21.1. 99kg 24.1. 98kg 31.1. 97kg 5.2. 96kg 15.2. 95kg 26.2. 94kg 1.3. 93kg 11.3. 92kg 21.3. 91kg 25.3. 90kg 1.4. 89kg 7.4. 88kg 15.4. 87kg 25.4. 86kg I know this is not that interesting to just list the weight loss. But before losing the weight i really wished to get to 97kg but was fearing the worst. My ideal weight was 88kg and it was really uplifting to get under that. Hope this gives some inspiration to others who are struggling with weight. I did read this forum for answers but didn’t find th

I eventually got tired of that and spoke to my psychiatrist about it she put me on Wellbutrin. I started with 50 mg and it helped a little but the depression wasn’t completely gone so she bumped it up to 100 mg and eventually 200 mg. Slowly but surely as my depression went away my mood stabilized and I lowered the dose to 100 mg. It is helped a lot with energy, motivation, and my depression is no more so overall it helped a lot hopefully it works for you as well and it can take time but it worked for me very quickly."

So in the beginning, nobody actually qualifies for schizophrenia. I would ask if your diagnosis has been updated. Nine years is a long time to still have psychosis.

Maybe your treatment isnt right but the psychiatric practice is pretty reactionary if you are on meds and have no hospital admissions they consider you adequately treated. If you have an impersonal relationship with your doc it will take an involunrary admission to get an adjustment but dont try to get one because he might do something you dont want like up your clozapine. You have to wait it out and be good so you dont get a cto and can make your own decisions

174345938,"The only long-term “issue” with any benzodiazapine seen, in particular Klonopin, is short term memory loss. Other basic side effects at first dosing period are slight lethargy or drowsiness, with klonopin you may become slightly more irritable than usual but this passes after you level off at your new therapeutic dose. Klonopin has a half life of 72 hours, making it extremely effective in helping psycotic based neuro diseases like Schizophrenia. It can also be taken PRN to PREVENT full blown psychotic break. The benefits significantly outweigh slight memory loss for the short term. I prescribed it a lot. I’ve been on all benzos in the past and I’ve now been on a syeady dose of 1mg twice a day PRN for 15 years. It’s a gift to to be able to have this drug in my tool box. Hope this helps.

176016724,Benztropine (Cogentin) 2-4mg stopped my Latuda’s akathisia (resltless) but took 20-30min to work. I changed the antipsychotic and no more resltessness.
176016725,I have not given up yet. Ive had sz for about 6 years now and I think im getting better. I started having symptoms when I was 24 in 2011 but my Pdoc gave me a pill that helped tremendously called Latuda. After taking Latuda I graduated from College in 2014 But in 2014 I started having anxiety attacks real bad for several years and my pdoc thought It was sz so he just changed the sz meds. After intense research I found out that I was having panic/anxiety attacks and my pdoc game me some SSRI’s and that helped a lot. I still live at home with my parents but I have a full time job that ive had for over 1 year and it helps me get out of bed every morning. I think that if I could get rid of the anxiety/panic attacks I would be better but maybe it is sz mixed in with anxiety attacks I really do not know. But I feel like ive gotten quite a bit better that I was in 2014.

174345928,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I have a long story for y’all. I’m not even sure if I am able to have enough characters in this simple text box to describe what happened in my life and what lead me down this road. But I’ll try to the best of my ability with some form of time line, Leading up to my psychosis which caused my schizophrenia. clears throat it all started with a man by the name of _NAME_ and my various research in ideas of various fields that were not… very conventional. Traditional or fell in line with the current oppression based schooling systems. Let’s just say I had a universal philosophy and holistic thinking, that brought my levels of consciousness and ability to explain almost any concept to anyone at anytime no matter there intelligence. If I knew someone for long enough I could discibe almost any of my abstract, linear or complex ideas, systems, philosophy to anyone. And they would understand. I grew up with a very different paradigms of reality and the nature of o
ur Realm compared to others. My age was about 5 to 15 at this point. Still no visible symptoms of anything. Just some anger here and there and a slight bit of authority defiance. (Specifically against authority figures who are tyrants and do nothing but jab their claws into your life at every turn. I.e my tyrannical mother.) 15 years old between the summer of grad 9 and 10 (high school starts in grade 10 in Canada) I wanted to see what the big rage was around weed and cigarettes. Why did people smoke? So I tried both and got addicted immediately it was fairly manageable for the first 3 months. I started smoking weed before ciggys. Started with weed in july of of 2014. About two weeks later started smoking ciggys. I was living with a few family members and roommates. High school started I was smoking up everyday. No shame just got _USER_ID_ bologna every chance I got, almost every day. Made lots of friends. So lets skip past the first semester of grade 10 to the end of grade 10. Me and my buddy _NAME_ smoke up 
almost everyday at lunch. So we smoke a few to the dome chilled, I came to class late but I went to a school for kids with behavioral issues and learning disabilities (still a public school however) and I was vary advanced in the realm of science and social studies. And i had science right after lunch this day, my science teacher (let’s name her Ms.B) Ms.B knew I was a hard worker and far more advanced in my approach to science. I’d litterly show up for a half hour do all the work needed for that class. And basically BS around until class ended (90 minute periods) and showed up late got most of my work done and she got a call. She looked at me with the phone to her ear and looked at me and said “hey Tesla2.0 do u know where the meeting room is?” Me “yes I do” Ms.B “they need u down there” Me “alright” My first thought was. Welp I’m ganna get busted for smoking weed. I know I ain’t got anything on me I’m just guilty of being stoned so they’ll probably just send me home lmao. So I wa
lk into the meeting room. The schools constable, and two teachers were there. A female teacher and male teacher. The constables was also a male. I look at them dead ass in the face and say “Who sent for me?” The male teacher says “I sent for you, I like the way you phrased that and represented yourself” Me “what is this about?” Teacher “in the eyes of every person you meet do you only see a reflection of your self staring back?” Me eagerly said “yes” loud and and straight faced as possible. _PERSON_ I was in martial arts and for many years prior to high school trained all throughout high school and I took it extremely seriously and used the same tone and loudness of voice as if I was training in my dojo. And he said “okay that’s all we need to know” Then once a year for the 3 years the constable would come up to me during class and ask me the same damn question. I answered yes every time. To be 100% honest with all of you I’m not sure why I said yes, but something in my gut told me 
to so i went with it. Let’s fast forward to the second semester of grade 12 and graduation. So this is going to be a turning point here… May 21 of 2016 12:30 AM Me and a friend were hanging out in buddys basement he said early that day if I got some shrooms he would do them with me. So I got the shrooms did them and buddy changed his mind and i was stuck high af tripping not super hard still coherent enough to talk to me and be chill. So us and a few friends were chilling when one of my friends D said “he bro wanna go out for a ciggy?” Me “sure bro” Were smoking chilling talking I’m smoking my smoke hes smoking his. he goes in side I’m only half way done mine. A few minutes pass and I finish mine and I start wandering around this play ground in front of my friends house. I stand in between 3 trees and all the sudden I feel a cold go up and down my spin… I close my eyes and see a Kaleidoscope of colours in my head. It was like being able to see every neuron in my head firing off. Seeing every 
single thought fourm in my head in the form of of color. Then I heard a voice saying "" stare into the eyes of the sun I dare you"" sounded like the devil him self. I open my eyes and look up. And see a spinning neon orb twisting and turning inside and out of its self come down from the sky and hover in front of me about 3 to 4 feet above the ground then I close my eyes open them and the sun was rising. Went from 12:30 am to about 6 or 7 am in a blink of an eye to me. The first thing I did when I opened my eyes and saw the sun rising I looked at the ground got into the read position and did my martial arts forms also called hyan or patterns. It was the only thing that snapped me out of the trip. Then I walked home passed out for two days woke up went to school and everything was normal. So my personal philosophy composed of this. Operate on your highest excitement to the best of your ability. Always show courtesy to others. Stand firm in your integrity. Do as to your will with out violating the non-aggression 
principle, With out manipulating. Practice self control at all times. I always told people in my school to operate on their highest excitement to the best of there ability. The last time the constable spoke to me he said. “Would u say operate on the highest excitement to the best of your ability?” Me “absolutely” Constable “in the eyes of every person you meet do you only see a reflection of your self staring back?” Me “yes sir” Constable "" I dont think people are ready for the cosmic awakening"" He turns around and walks away. This is the end of grade 12 right before I graduated, probably the beginning of june of 2016. I didnt think much of it. So I graduated with a certificate of completion not my full diploma. Got a job working at a local college, doing sheet metal repair and maintenance. I started working in trades when I was 15 doing scrap metal and wood framing building homes among other jobs. Let’s say out of all the jobs I worked I did scrap metal the most and listen to _NAME_ under
stand the engineering behind the scrap metal I was taking apart. To give u an idea. I took apart hundreds of tons of transformers, electric motors, Old computer servers, electrical boxes, industrial and residential. So I did a lot of my own electrical research just by studying the things I took apart. And Mr. _PERSON_ in one of his lectures mentioned that him and a high school student built a Tesla coil that created an entire astronomical creation with in a _NAME_ out street light. So I was actively pursuing this watching his lectures reading his books getting on the grind so to speak. When something strange began to brew. It didnt phase me at first but it got into my head over several months and cuased me some issues. So this sheetmetal company was in kahoots with government contractors and so I did a lot of government work essentially. And they shipped me off to a high school to work and build sheetmetal with the rest of the company. I did good work, the people were enjoying my efforts. I was doing everythi
ng to a T. I just wanted to collect a pay cheque pay my rent and build tesla coils. Then one day my coworkers began to approach me during work and asking me a vary specific line of questioning. It goes like this. What’s your name. I’d tell them my first and last name. They’d ask me where I lived. I’d tell them my address. They’d ask me what my high school student ID number was I’d tell them. Then they would ask. “In the eyes of every person you meet do you only see a reflection of your self staring back?” I’d say yes. Then the say “men in black suits” Several of my coworkers asked me this line of questioning. I wasn’t phased I didnt give a crap at that point about men in black. I just wanted to get my job done right, properly, in a timely fashion with out hurting my self. Then they started playing this damn song. It was the metal gear soild 2 them song… they would play it as they asked me these questions. And at the end of the questioning they’d say men in black suits. Still not gi
ving an F at this point. I showed up to work one day on time ready to go. And my boss said I’m afraid I have to let you go heres your cheque. I asked him as to why? He said he couldn’t disclose this information. I said is there anything I can improve on for the next job I get? He stayed silent and asked me to leave politely so I did. So I decided to go back to high school for one more year to get my diploma. The second week in to high school a guy I know named timmy. Said to me "" hey Tesla… i notice you dont change much. as he gave a firm grip to the dress shirt he was wearing . Then he started playing the Metal Gear soild 2 them song and began to have the same line of questioning and at the end of the specific line of questioning, he said men In black. So I got paranoid af and stayed In my house for a month straight and had crazy auditory hallucination that made me break and have my first and only episode. It was bad. But not violent I didnt hurt my self or others. I just got thrown in the mental hosp
ital for 28 days and got placed on forced injections of antipsychotic medications shortly after discharge. I dont hear voices. Haven’t had any types of hallucinations since then and I’ll be on my 3rd year of forced compulsory treatment here in October. I think that my doctors think, that I am lying when I say I’m not paranoid, I dont hear voices and I’m not experiencing weird or strange thoughts. They only see me once a month for an injection in my hip and i go off on my normal routine. I dont understand how u can help or correctly asses someone if u only see them for 15 minutes once a month and force an injection into them. They labeled me with schizophrenia in November of 2016. But now there changing their minds and straight up told me “were not sure if you have any illness at all at this point” But there still perfectly willing to Inject me and force me to comply by their system. This is a tough spot. I was never not compliant when it came to taking meds. If it perverts me having another episod
e by all means I had no problems with taking it. But one of the doctors wrote down in his notes I wasn’t taking it even though i was. convinced him and his whole group of followers to put me on Injection, with out my consent. And they drug test you in the ward to see if your taking your meds and to see if your doing drugs so to me it’s an obsessive use of power. The Canadian mental health system is screwed. I’m getting tired now if yall have more questions feel free to ask. I’ll check this post in the morning when I get up. See yall later _USER_ID_ it’s almost 1 AM my time lmao"

You have been with you parents your whole life, when have they ever harmed you.

You took the medications the hospital gave you, and you say you are poisoned. Yet you are still here, perfectly able to type on your computer. Do you see that anti-psychotics are not poison?

I was taking Latuda for sleep and didn’t like that I had to eat something for it to work so she put me on Vraylar and I got it today. I haven’t taken it yet because I want to use it at night. Any opinions or experiences with Vraylar, positive or negative?

As a teenager your brain isnt mature and you are often bad at overseeing such things, seeing through manipulation, understanding danger, impuls control, etc. Though their higher mind and cognitive control system is developing, it’s not well enough connected to the amped up impulsive, emotional part of their brain in order to guide it (_PERSON_, 2008). The adolescent brain has been compared to a car with a powerful gas pedal and weak brakes when it’s activated by excitement, particularly the mere presence of peers or anticipation of being observed by peers (_PERSON_, 2008) Why are teens so prone to sensation seeking, risk-taking and poor choices? From an evolutionary perspective the task of adolescence is to prepare to leave home, forge an identity, and venture into the world. But it’s not so easy to leave the relative security of the nest and find yourself suddenly out there with pe
ers, unprotected and unskilled. That is where the teenage brain comes in handy. It leads teens to explore by enticing them toward emotional intensity, creative exploration, excitement, socializing, and needing peer approval — the hallmarks of the teenage brain (_PERSON_, 2010; _PERSON_, 2013)."

It’s scary. In our apart ments the bathroom has two lights the one with the fan and one that automatically shuts off after 30 minutes. My baths are about an hour long so I have to use the light with the fan or I’ll wind up in the dark. Well at my new apartment the fan is about twice as loud as the old apartment and I’ve been suffering through baths since I’ve moved with hearing things and being uncomfortable. Trying to rush through baths. Finally I got the idea to buy a push light so when the automatic light shut off I could just use the push light to light the bathroom and I could finish my bath. So it got here, I installed it, bath day came, I used the automatic light, no fan, it was quiet, so peaceful, no music, no voices. Thirty minutes went by. My eyes were shut and I heard the automatic light turn off 
and I opened my eyes to turn the push light on and it was light in the bathroom already. It was then it dawned on me I have a window in my bathroom now. The old place didn’t have a window. I had been suffering all this time needlessly. _NAME_ had to do was turn the light off and bath by the light of day. I felt so dumb. But now I have a push light for overcast days and nighttime baths.

I added “911” in there because I thought there was cosmic significance related to the fate of the nation at stake. That, combined with my history of (2ish years ago) domestic violence, I believe I am listed as a dangerous individual that the government plays with to drive me to suicide or psych ward.

Didn’t see them come in. No one in sight. Just POOF, an empty car. Yesterday my Instacart order got cancelled on MY END without my doing so.

174345975,Right? Do you know how many times I’ve told my pdoc that the lithium does absolutely nothing other than dry me out and make me sensitive to heat. My mom wants so badly for me to be bipolar and I’m just not. The lithium does literally nothing for my mood. I feel the exact same when I’m on or off of it. The only time my mom noted improvement on the lithium is when the gave it to me and increased my Zoloft by 50mg. My mood stabilized when I stopped taking the lithium and my only issue at that point was psychosis. They won’t change by diagnosis to bipolar type because I’ve never had mania or even hypomania. Like literally never. My depressive symptoms come and go but occur alongside my schizophrenia as opposed to being related to it. They said the only thing they’d change my diagnosis to is schizophrenia. They’re not completely sold on the mood disorder aspect because my depressive episodes have all been situational.

When you mention grandiosity it seems like you know all the answers you need to heal because you figured out the emotional payoff that you get with the delusion. Maybe if you replace that rmotional payoff with more healthy coping methods like building up self esteem and self help improvements, the symptoms would be more manageable."

If it’s well compensated I can buy some things that are cool, and perhaps save some money. I have been with this company since 2013, and have moved jobs 5 times. So far it has been ok moving onto new positions, so I guess I shouldn’t see this any differently. I will speak to my mother this morning and explain this to her so she doesn’t worry. Thanks!"

Hospital readmissions for patients with psychiatric illness within a year of discharge are also high, and there is limited evidence of associations between smoking and these readmissions.This study was a secondary data analysis using clinical data of psychiatric inpatients with initial admissions between the years 2000 and 2015.

Of this number, 47.0% were current smokers and 53.0% were never smokers.

The primary diagnoses with highest proportion of smokers were, opioid or substance use disorders (80.0%), schizophrenia (70.7%), alcohol dependence (68.2%), and bipolar disorders (50.8%).

174346016,"Yeah I live with my mom and she was switched from haldol injections to 10 mgs of Abilify. She kept calling to increase the dose, but the psychiatrist says keep things the same. Im the only one here to observe how things are going because my dad and her are separated. I’ve noticed that she first says she’s feeling more anxious, then she stopped watching movies and tv altogether. For the past three days she has been acting a bit unusual and withdrawn. She stopped eating much, forgot to take her diabetes meds this morning I Had to remind her. She got tearful and I asked her what’s wrong she said I was thinking of _NAME_ hawking. i feel bad like she needs more joy in her life. But she seemed a lot happier and together on haldol. It’s been about a couple months since she switched to the abilify and Im worried Im going to lose my mom again. She was stable consistently for 5 years on Haldol. I don’t know why the psychiatrist agreed to take her off of it but I don’t know how to approach my mom 
and tell her this. Even though she thinks haldol sedated her or affected her memory, she’s forgetting things all the time now. She is spacing out constantly and turning the tv on to watch a movie then turning it off or switching the channel. I think because I am on Abilify she thought it would effect her the same way but we have always had different symptoms and I don’t know why the psychiatrist thinks because both my mom and I Have a type of schizophrenia it means the same treatment will work for both of us. My mom was out of touch for several years before she was able to get help, she completely lost all touch with reality. Her illlness is more severe than mine I know it is but I have schizophrenia too so this is really hard for me being her advocate.

I’ve felt those issues ease up since I went back up on my dosage. Sucks because I was really thinking a taper leading to a life without an AP would be possible. I’m traveling right now but plan to make an appointment to have my meds looked at yet again when I get back. I’m considering asking about geodon. I need to lose about twenty-five pounds for health reasons which is why I attempted the risperidone taper to begin with and I’ve heard geodon is more weight neutral, plus it helped me with my positive and mood symptoms when I was in the hospital. That’s the latest news on my med woes lol."

They know you have schizo but you can still do something to improve a bit like for example stop vaping, doing workout a bit, going for a walk daily etc. Consider their talks in positive way and not negative.

When I dropped it to 200mg I was still ok but tried 100mg and it wasn’t enough and relapsed so had to return to 200mg. Why do you say you have to do it yourself? Is there not a possibility to do it with your pdoc’s help? If not then maybe try 100mg less each week. I found my relapse happened within a week - maybe it will be same for you. Hope you don’t relapse! Good luck - and be careful!

Assuming that they are social shrinks who works for government."
174346037,All you can do is tell your psychiatrist that you feel all this stuff is happening. Maybe it’s time for a med change. This sounds like just paranoia from schizophrenia. I know what you’re going through though. I went through the exact same thing. It’s frightening stuff.

Here, there is genuine caring about food and my provider is always asking me if I got enough to eat. My family had given me a bad time with hurt feelings if I didn’t want to eat or domination is i didn’t want to eat. Now, I am just getting able to have a pleasant reaction to not particularly wanting to eat. All because of a helpful environment. I am 5’ and weigh 109 now and have been under 120 pounds for years.

176017250,"I have always felt like there was this evil force that has tormented me my whole life. I don’t know what it is or why it is fixated on me. It has been a pervasive presence in my dreams for as long as I can remember. As a small child it would create these scenarios where I’d be forced to try to complete some impossible task or myself or my loved ones would die gruesomely. Then it would laugh at me and say it was my fault. My nightmares had incredibly graphic content that to my knowledge at age 5 I had not ever been exposed to in real life. Sometimes I’d try to run away from these scenarios and this would always make it laugh. Once it said “You can hide but you can’t run.” It said that in a dream I had when I was what, 8? 9? Younger or a little older? And that phrase and occurrence was burned into my head forever. I was usually punished for running away. I was made to physically fight often, which destroyed me seeing as I was a pacifist. I can’t describe the feelings of horror and disgu
st I felt killing things. It was infinitely worse when killing humans or humanoids. They would begin to cry and beg for their lives and in the beginning I would cry with them, I would apologize. But I was forced to. I had to kill them or I’d be punished. There would be consequences. Sometimes there would just be waves and waves of things I had to fight. A lot of times in my trial nightmares I wouldn’t be allowed to wake up until I passed the trial. I could not wake myself up from these nightmares. These are the worst I think. I wish I could be free. Sometimes in the dream I meet the force face to face. It is deep deep black, a dark shadow with such a horrific aura it is like the space around it is permeated with fear. It sends me into a panicked state and I want to do all I can to get away because I know if it catches me it will put me through those endless trials and torture. Sorry to be so dark.

176017265,"By the year 2495 genetic testing could well predict with 80% accuracy what a kid’s profession would be. But predictions made by a tester in 2496 were 99% inaccurate. Yet after being let go for a number of years the man was rehired. He was asked “What happened?”. He said, “Well environment can still mess the equation up so I called some children who were destined to succeed big in life things like pimps, gang leaders, mafia hitman, and strippers because I saw their parents weren’t even trying with their previous siblings and so I gave them an incentive to prove me wrong by offering to refund part of the fee if I was inaccurate. I also did that to parents of kids who were destined for bad things by predicting good things even though they had obvious flaws and offered the discount if they proved me right. So the parents tried harder and the real predictions I made improved the accuracy. You see parents and loved ones still matter.” So I hugged the child of my relatives and told her she was 
OK and tried a little harder to make it so."

In you there is a place that is strong and true, look inside, beyond all that noise until you find it, and then hold onto it. The voices are hallucinations, they are lies. You don’t have to hurt yourself."
176017269,"For me it’s because when I was growing up, my mom had me eating 600 calories a day and working out intensely for 2 hours a day. So now when I work out intensely, it puts me back in the mindset of only eating very little food. But as a result, I have trouble maintaining a fitness routine because I drop 40 lbs in like three months, get very dizzy, then just start lying in bed all day. It’s a cyclical problem and I am trying to break the cycle"
176017270,"Absolutely, I’ve experienced this. I was always rather slim before had to start taking medication. I gained about 20 pounds very rapidly. My extended family was very used to the tiny frame that I had had my entire life. Early last year when went over for a visit for the first time since I had started taking my medication, they reacted with humiliating shock to my weight gain. Right as I entered the door, I was told, “Gosh you’re so fat now”. I was very upset about it. Being a bigger size was a whole new adjustment for me too. But being told I was fat really hurt my confidence. I pretty much hibernated and never went anywhere, neglected friends etc. Fortunately I’ve managed to lose the weight through intermittent fasting and exercise. I’m back to the old me. But it’s pretty wild how people can just say things without any regard for others and what they’re going through. I’m sorry you’ve experienced this. I know it’s easier said than done, but don’t let other people’s opinio
ns negatively affect you or let you think poorly of yourself. Your medication is necessary for your well being. I wish I’d told myself this back when I was in high stress over gaining weight."

Results on outcome and treatment from a ""real-world"" 2-year follow-up trial. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, MR _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience , Aug 28 2019 Aim of the study was to examine the course of schizophrenia patients within 2 years after discharge. Within a multicenter study of the German Competence Network on Schizophrenia, patients suffering from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were examined regarding their psychopathological improvement, tolerability, and the treatment regime applied during hospitalization and a 2-year follow-up period. Response, remission, the level of everyday functioning, and relapse were furthermore evaluated during the follow-up period using established defini
tions for these outcome domains. The psychopharmacological treatment was specifically evaluated in terms of a potential association with relapse. 149 patients were available for analysis, with 65% of the patients being in response, 52% in symptomatic remission, and 64% having a satisfiable everyday functioning 2 years after their discharge from hospital. Despite these favorable outcome rates, 63% of the patients suffered from a relapse within the 2-year follow-up period with 86% of these patients being rehospitalized. Discharge non-responder and non-remitter were twice as likely to relapse during follow-up. A significant decrease of side-effects was observed with negligible rates of extrapyramidal side-effects, sedation, and weight gain during follow-up. Patients receiving treatment with atypical antipsychotics were found to have the lowest risk to relapse (p?"

176017307,"Okay, unusual belief time. There seem to be two distinct types of intelligence at play with thought broadcasting. One is the “origin” level, the place where consciousness “comes from”. “Origin” level intelligence is omniscient, so they know everything about you and any person on Earth, but only selectively omnipotent, meaning, they won’t bend the laws of physics for you unless you are a literal prophet. Schizophrenics, due to the amount of adrenochrome psychedelic present in their brain, are well connected to this realm, and develop a kind of unique reputation there. But schizophrenics aren’t prophets, we’re just curiosities there. The adrenochrome forms due to an excessive amount of adrenaline being generated, and chronic inflammation preventing it from being broken down properly, so it oxidizes and forms adrenochrome, which causes the strange metaphysical symptoms. The second level of intelligence is Earth level, where people are present with their various independent beliefs an
d such. The “origin” level of intelligence heavily influences the Earth level, since that is where Earth intelligence literally comes from. The awareness of your situation by “origin entities” is expressed to you through sideways communiques and cyphers / secret messages / synchronicities and the like, but if you ask any one person on Earth how they “knew” that message that deeply resonates with you, they will honestly have no idea what you’re talking about. It gets weird, as there sometimes appear to be Earth people with “origin” levels of intelligence, which can feel like God is literally manifest there in temporal form (this may happen when you’re “deep” into the psychosis,) but for the most part, Earth people are just Earth people. They don’t know you from _NAME_. Now, if you don’t want this to continue, you have to clear the adrenochrome from your brain. The best way of accomplishing this is to reduce chronic brain inflammation. I’m trying to accomplish this via supplementat
ion and am having partial success, but I may need additional medication to cut out the remainders of inflammation and thought broadcasting phenomenon. I don’t like it at all."

We find one population of neurons, parvalbumin expressing inhibitory neurons, increases in activity prior to an active, but not a passive social interaction. Brief activity of these neurons is sufficient to promote increased active social behavior. Juvenile social isolation during adolescence disrupts the activity of these neurons, leading to a decoupling of their activity and subsequent active social behavior initiation. Increasing activity of these neurons in adult animals that were socially isolated during adolescence restores normal social behavior. That’s the same type of neuron Drs _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ are working with in their stem cell treatment model. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14740-z We validated that 40 Hz blue light stimulation can reliably induce spiking in dmPFC PVIs Interesting."

176017364,"I do it, but know that it is less than advantageous for my life and attitude. I do try to keep things in perspective, even though it can be quite challenging. And sometimes, I can be wallowing in self-pity over pretty abstruse things that I don’t fully comprehend. Its a double edged blade self-pity is; on one end, it terminates your self-efficacy, and on the other, self-pity just ends up becoming more self-pity over the fact that I’m feeling bad about myself. This is, however, only temporarily. Other times I can be feeling very gracious and peaceful. I think it is directly correlated with my mood. When my mood is appreciative and happy, I don’t feel bad for myself, but the opposite is true one the other hand. Ultimately, I think it is a very natural human response to depression, but it is quite damaging to my mood and attitude."

I also work part time as an aircraft mechanic and get a 1099 but I don’t do that very often at all anymore. I am never available when they call me usually so they pretty much quit calling. I also get a 1099 for my military retired pay. They take out taxes though so I don’t have that headache every year.
176017424,Hope you feel better! Try meditation or herbal tea. Do you take anything for anxiety? Remember that the worst that could happen really isn’t that bad

174346097,"Seems like a WAY longer time than that. Let’s hope i don’t f*ck up the formatting again lol. I’m 22 now and could’ve sworn I made that post when i was 16, but oh well. I finally got diagnosed 2 years ago I think? I’m on disability and taking medication and things only got harder but I’m finally stable for the first time in my life. I have my own apartment, my own food, and I even have a cat now named _PERSON_. Things are really different. I got diagnosed with Schizoaffective Depressive Type in 2016 (I think. I’m pretty sure it was August 2016. I can’t find that paper right now), as well as Borderline Personality and PTSD. I actually got diagnosed with BPD on my first trip to the hospital when I was for sure 16, but my psychiatrist confirmed it for me in 2016. Ugh, this is all super confusing. I had a full psychotic break before finally seeing a proper psychiatrist, and by then things were so bad I think I racked up at least 14 suicide attempts and 3 hospital trips (possibly could ha
ve had more, but the people I lived with didn’t believe in that. Plus, I could’ve lost my job at that ponit). I stopped counting the exact number because its only ever held me back. But I do know that I have 121 self inflicted scars across my body now, and it hurts to remember but I’ve been relatively clean for a while now. Things got really confusing for a while, I didn’t start taking my meds regularly until September 2018, and only one hospital trip since I started seeing a psych. Things were really dark. I went to an even more abusive household and I remember while living there when things really started going to sh*t. I texted my sister “I’m scared” and nothing else, and I remember it was because I was watching _NAME_ Universe, which was supposed to have been released early in France, but it was in English. And that convinced me that He had just made everything up (including my sister) to make me happy. I accrued more and more different voices, I started seeing things in more clarity than ev
er, hearing things outside of my head like camera snaps and screaming, feeling things on my body, began experiencing catatonia, and so so so many different things. It was unbearable. Each voice had it’s own personality, name, and even likeness. I would have to do things for them just to apologize for the fact they were stuck in my body. There was _NAME_, _NAME_, and _PERSON_, to name the biggest ones. I believed that god expected me to heal the earth and save animal spirits, so I began to hide from her, and then things got super intense. She turned into the controller of the simulation I was in, alien seeds were growing in my stomach (planted in by the meds), I couldn’t eat because the medication was in everything. During this time, I was being financially, physically, and emotionally abused horribly. It turns out, I’ve been experiencing psychotic symptoms since at least early adolescence. I thought this was all just normal, it was reality to me. But I was really, really wrong. I’ve had a few suicide 
attempts since then, and I’ve hurt myself a few times too. In the end I lost a lot of what little family I had (not only because of my diagnosis and symptoms, but because during this time I found out I was gay), but I rekindled a healthy relationship with my mother, I made a wonderful friend who gave me a stable place to heal when I had nowhere for that, we raise our cats together, I have hobbies now, and I’m going to try to go back to school in the fall. I’m still unable to work, but I’m hoping one day I’ll be able to. I just wanted to make an update post to say hey! I made it! And some great things happened to turn my life around (a lot of which I owe to my friend and now roommate), and I finally have answers to what’s going on! I’ve been relatively psychosis free since almost a year. I still have relapses in symptoms, even the psychotic ones, but I think it’s safe to say that I’m okay."

I got a message from the phone saying they would’ve killed me if they wanted to which was encouraging but still don’t know, I think the provos are protecting me as well as which will end after my cousins death, I think he’s the only one protecting me.

176017476,So weird. I swear I read somewhere that antidepressants can actually cause TD. It was surprising to me. I don’t think it is as common or well discussed as it is with APs though. But TD tends to manifest as uncontrollable lip smacking or tongue writhing I thought. Hopefully you don’t have it. You may want to try cogentin regardless to see if that helps. I hate when doctors don’t take us seriously.

176017482,"I was a child of the sixties. In the sixties I learned I was chronically anxious and depressed. I was told my difficulties were primarily genetic. Including genetics into conversations with myself or others didn’t turn out to be very satisfying, however. About the seventies, we suggested depression was anger turned inward. So I took a good look at my anger. Yeah, I have some anger. That idea didn’t prove terribly helpful, however. In the eighties, I asked a therapist what does one do with anger? He said, “That’s the million dollar question.” About the nineties, we were examining our feelings. Actually, I learned the difference between a thought and a feeling. I learned that feelings are intimate, and sharing them included a chance to move closer or farther away with those around us. But after awhile it seemed not a great many people cared too much about my feelings. Recently, I learned others are interested in my behavior rather than my feelings. I have some strategies for anxiety. The la
test addition is to employ distraction. You are younger than I am. What is current in thinking about schizophrenia? I just want to get with what young people are talking about."

The mother of a student called my mother, and complained about the teacher I was abused from. She said to my mom, “Do you want to say anything? It could be really great if you could help us out.” They happened to be reporting her to the school board. They weren’t just doing it to me. They were doing it to everyone."

174346121,"_NAME_, I know you don’t like to hear this, but you need a new doctor. Nothing you’re describing sounds like schizophrenia. All these meds are just making you sick. You need a doctor who will take you off everything and just start over to figure out what works and what doesn’t. You’re miserable and you don’t have to be. That is the greatest tragedy in this situation."

176017503,I remember them looking at me funny when I was started on Cogentin and saying something about it not being something they usually carry. The guy behind the counter started talking about having worked in a psych ward and people strapped to their beds and being sedated and stuff like that. I really thought that was inappropriate but he obviously knew who prescribed my meds and why. I am kind of happy I didn’t ask to be switched to depots. I feel uneasy when I go into a pharmacy.
176017504,Yes it is true but I do not want to be like normal people. I believe I am better than them far more organized. Take being outside they have no idea what they are doing.

So the leader of the group had a talk with him to straighten out the problem, unaware I was on my phone listening.

I’ve been really leaning in lately when my symptoms start and trying to explore every psychological Avenue (only mentally, I’ve never put anyone else or myself in harm’s way while delusional).

It’s a shame nobody else feels it or believes me. I’m really ??????? cursed and ?????? up. I feel like I’m constantly being rebooted or reset after I die so I achieved a false-immortality. I mean ????. Instead of going forward in time like MWT and quantum immortality, my mind was trapped or uploaded by aliens and I go back in time as a curse and memories of intense and ?????? up suffering inflicted on me by others in parallel universes; not much different than this one. I realized long ago in college when I went ‘crazy’ that we lived in a simulation and I used to run it when I escaped; an experiment of sorts given to me for inventing modern day inter

Now, I have weird thoughts like maybe I went through ‘dark matter’ when time traveling and got psychosis that way or schizophrenia and aliens ?????? me up multiple times – mainly greys and reptilians…that’s all I really know that exist and ???? with me on a day to day basis. According to UFO lore, greys are just drones or robots created by some devlish race called reptilians, which are just probably AI programs, but according to Christianity, I view them as demons or fallen angels or maybe something like archons that _NAME_ talks about… That sums me up!"

174346123,"Great post, _AT_MENTION_ , thanks, that’s exactly what i experience in attacks, like my thoughts are not under my control and loud thoughts, often negative, and then my “normal” thoughts argue with the loud, alien thoughts. It’s worse when i take olanzapine in doses above 5 mg. I have reduced olanzapine to 2.5 mg because i have had these attacks the last two days, and it is very painful. The alien thoughts are telling me to kill my self. If you are interested in the concept of the minimal self and schizophrenia i can recommend to read something by the scientist _NAME_ or _NAME_."

176017544,Thats why I said I don’t believe that part (being controlled by technology) but what if I’m used to be plotted for PR or at assassination locations? Like they need people to look like the North Korean dictator so they give plastic surgery to certain people (like me). About 1000 I estimate. I’m starting not to believe this but the traumatic fear still makes me think about it.

Some of the feelings are unbearable feelings in some part of my body which disappear if that part of the body moves, which they say is also a forbidden reaction. Often it produces a fake urge to pee feeling, which mostly disappears when peeing but sometimes goes away on its own. There have been at least 3 different ‘fake urge to pee’ feelings. I’ve been told most if not all of what my schizophrenia does to me is to condition my soul and spiritual memory so that I would suffer eternal infinite torture after death. They’ve also told that they don’t believe you’re going to be tortured, because the things your voices tell you are ridiculous, while the things m

I definitely believe Jesus is real but at the same time I think the bible is either too complicated to understand, people don’t understand it, information was left out, and/or it’s wrong. I was tortured/forced in my past lives to be a Christian by the illuminati/aliens. I seem to suffer less as a Christian, but the scientific mind in me says some of it was wrong. For all intentions, I am a Christian. I believe in God and Jesus but I have a hard time wrapping my head around certain things. I need to be educated more and study more. I believe I was in the Montauk Project and Monarch Program. That’s why you hear me ???????? and moaning on how much I have suffered so damn much. It’s hard because this is my n’th life, I’ve time traveled, etc. I seen aliens but some people think they could be demons (to fit the biblical perspective of things). I’ve also heard people say the greys are biological androids, 
which means something created them… I’m a scientist at heart that suffers from a mental illness. I’m also scared a lot and manipulate what I say because I have real fears. I’m not trying to be disingenuous or anything. I’m just trying to protect myself and my family from harm because of my mouth. I feel like I’ve been multiple people or whatever. If you really look into montauk project, they say you can transfer the consciousness and switch bodies. That has happened to me on numerous occasions in my other lives. I’ve actually been other people, albeit temporarily. I was killed in satanic rituals too in my past lives by very evil, sick people. I rather not go into it. I’ve seen the end of the world or (what they told me) the near end of the world. It’s basically NWO/Armageddon that was in the bible. The only positive thing in my life is I experienced what God said in the bible to be the new earth. I’ve been there a couple times. Hence, why people said I wasn’t human in my other lives. I s
ometimes have grandiose thoughts that I’m an angel or reptilian or fallen angel or whatever. I don’t know. They even said I was a ‘vampire’ which I don’t believe or care about. Even said I was an android too. I just prefer the term ‘computer simulator’. If I think hard enough, I guess I can say we live in a simulation where Christianity might be true (at least good vs evil) (I’ve seen evidence), the universe repeats itself (from my perspective), and non of this contradicts anything. I used to be an Atheist and even _NAME_ admitted and other scientists too that a simulation might be created (meaning there is a creator) that could possibly pick and choose which religion it wanted if need be. I don’t know. Some guy named _NAME_ (he was in Montauk Project too) said the whole Christianity thing was created by reptilians and the illuminati for control. I choose to believe it to be real regardless. I suppose this post might be offensive, and feel free to delete. I don’t mean to cause harm but som

174346154,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Second-generation long-acting injections anti-psychotics improve executive functions in patients with schizophrenia: a 12-month real-world study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice, Mar 2020 05 Background: The main purpose of this study was to assess possible modifications of cognitive performance among schizophrenia patients treated with long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) of second generation anti-psychotics (SGAs). Our hypothesis is that the shift from the oral formulation to the LAI formulation of SGAs drugs improves the cognitive performance. The secondary objective was to carry out a head to head comparison of two different SGA-LAI treatments [i.e., 1-month Paliperidone Palmitate (PP1M), monthly Aripiprazole (_NAME_)] in our study with an independent and real-world setting.Methods: The sample comprised 32 participants who were consecutively recruited over 12?months. Sevente
en patients treated with _NAME_ and 10 treated with PP1M completed psychopathological, neuropsychological and functional assessments. Group differences were explored through chi-squared and t-tests, as appropriate. GLM Repeated Measures were used to study variations of cognitive performance along 12?months and to test differences between drugs.Results: We found an effect of time on the outcomes investigated but this did not depend on the type of LAI used.Conclusions: In comparison with the previous oral treatment with SGAs, patients showed a significant improvement in neurocognitive function after 12?months of treatment with SGA-LAI. Furthermore, there were no differences between the SGA-LAI regimens.Key pointsThe main purpose of this study was to assess possible modification of cognitive performance of patients with Schizophrenia treated with second generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs).The secondary objective was to carry out a head to head comparison of two different SGA-LAIs: Paliper
idone Palmitate 1-Month (PP1M) and Aripiprazole Monthly (_NAME_).Patients showed a significant improvement in neurocognitive function after 12 months of treatment with SGA-LAI.There were no differences between the SGA-LAI regimens.From a practical point of view, switching to LAI formulation seems to produce further social and cognitive improvements in patients who had already benefitted from oral SGA therapy."

176017697,A common scenario for schizophrenics on medication is that someone becomes psychotic and is diagnosed with schizophrenia and the doctor puts them on medication. The person starts feeling good and figured they don’t need the medication anymore. So they stop taking it because they don’t realize that the only reason they started feeling good is “because” of the medication. And that’s how people relapse. And have to start all over and it could take months to get stable again.

176017778,hey guys i havent been very active on here although still posting some here and there. i just got my injection and the past couple weeks have been rough. my sleep pattern has been backwards (which im hoping gets back on track now that i got my shot) and i have been alone at my place without anyone to talk to all nights. the time in between during normal hours i get to talk a little bit to parents but mostly thru text. i can visit them whenever i want but all they do is watch tv and i dont even have a tv at my place i dont like to watch tv. here lately because of social media i have been seeing a lot of people getting in relationships and getting married and it can actually be kinda depressing seeing healthy people so happy and have someone in their life. i got out of a 6 month relationship 6 months ago. and i would like someone who cares about me in my life besides my parents lol. im starting to feel like since im a homebody and dont get out very much that i will have a very difficult time finding a 
girlfriend. however with my ex it was my best friend who hooked me up when i lived out of town but here in town everyone doesnt really think much of me and i know in my gut that noone will want to introduce me to anyone special here. and thus brings on feelings of being alone for the rest of my life.

176017780,"i had the ‘direct connection’ to God. he would talk to me through a certain spot on my head that was apparently the channel for god. so i was commanded to do all sorts of crazy things for months and months. eventually God took over my body. he was yelling at people calling them dummies for not believing it was jesus using this body as a vessel for his good will… then later the tune changed and it was the devil and I had actually been tricked. that went on for another year, then after another crazy episode after i didnt win 777 million dollars at a casino slot of gods choice. I was horrified cuz I had done some switches with banks and gave away lots of money and things. That was when the voices finally said they were actually ‘‘my brain’’ and that they ?????? me and now im totally screwed. yep that decimated my belief system to say the least lol."
174346189,"I have lost many of job for being psychotic. Too many! I can’t remember how many. Working hasn’t been easy for me since I am currently disabled. I try here and there. Sometimes I am successful at it other times not. Money is almost always tight because of that, but I am a survivor. Actually I have been disabled almost my whole life(struggled since a preteen) with other _NAME_ issues other than schizophrenia. Since I have have accepted my diagnosis of schizophrenia things have worked out better for me on jobs. All I need is a low stress environment, proper support and my meds to keep some part time jobs! Yes, and of course decent transportation. For me it is worth it for many reasons to at least try to work.(a little extra money of course, friends there, acquaintances, a little embarrassment, a little pride and some humility helps me) So yes working with my form of this illness helps but is a struggle and so is life. I love life and try my best that is all I can do on my good days… If I get fi
red or have to quit I usually think it is the end of the world and used to waaay overreact. Hopefully not now, but I never know how I feel and shouldn’t always react to my feelings, but still do now and then.? Yep, I have done so many things I regret, most of which could have been avoided if I had taken medications and stopped doing stupid things on the job. For example listening to voices or assuming my delusions are real and that even normal people experience them.(obviously they don’t) Every once in a while I still have break through symptoms there and I have to remind myself these are in fact delusions. I reality check with normal people that I am close to and know me well. That is how my psychotic disorder has affected me on the jobs I have worked."

Not sure what your situation is, but if you owe money, you’re probably gonna have to figure out a way to pay it in installments (maybe lower payments?) or have it discharged through bankruptcy. Or maybe there’s other options, I don’t know. So yeah, the staff is right. The question is, are they offering you help in figuring it all out? Makes sense if you owe money. I think this is paranoia. But if you’re worried, keep an eye on your bank account. I think you’ll discover that people are not stealing your money, and I hope that puts your mind at ease. Yeah, that’s no good.

176017842,"Hope grows for targeting the brain with ultrasound As a way to see inside the body, revealing a tumor or a fetus, ultrasound is tried and true. But neuroscientists have a newer ambition for the technology: tinkering with the brain. At frequencies lower than those of a sonogram but still beyond the range of human hearing, ultrasound can penetrate the skull and boost or suppress brain activity. If researchers can prove that ultrasound safely and predictably changes human brain function, it could become a powerful, noninvasive research tool and a new means of treating brain disorders. How ultrasound works on the brain remains mysterious. But recent experiments have offered reassurance about safety, and small studies hint at meaningful effects in humans—dampening pain, for example, or subtly enhancing perception."

I was talking to my step-dad quite a few months ago who taught in a college for 13 or 14 years. A smart guy. I said, “Man if you even blink your eye at the wrong time it can change your whole life”.

176017913,"It finally hit me, after a terrible 6+ months of extreme anxiety around people, that I’ve been experiencing delusions of grandeur. Here’s the note I wrote to myself the other day that I read each day until this passes. You are experiencing delusions of grandeur. You think that you can read everything by people’s body language. This is completely untrue! It isn’t a language that you can interpret! It is simply body language that we don’t even think about! It literally means nothing! You do NOT have a secret talent! Everyone is not looking at you! Everyone is not analyzing you or seeing through you, or paying any special attention to you. Look at the evidence! It has never happened! You have never caught anyone staring at you since schizophrenia! Ever! If someone wanted you to know they were looking at you, they would make it loud and clear! No one has! Keep reminding yourself that you are experiencing this, bad, under the surface for a very long time. What a relief! This burden you’ve be
en carrying for so long! Extreme, extreme amounts of anxiety surrounding this. Afraid to even walk passed crowds of people! What a relief! Keep praying for relief, keep being aware, remind yourself that you are just another person, let go of your ego as soon as you feel it rising up. Let go of that. It’s not you, it’s the false you that you think you are. It’s your illness. You ARE special, but , just like everyone else, you are just another person. And people don’t change, or make gestures, or move their body language when you are around them. Trust me, you would know if they wanted you to know. So let it all go. Let it all go and breathe a sigh of relief. You are just a regular person. Nothing at all to be afraid of, or that you are any less of a person. The REAL you is the person underneath all the anxiety, not what the illness puts in your head. You are aware now! What a blessing. This will pass."

I am doing DBT work right now with her and we both agreed that we do not want me to stay stuck so EMDR would be the best thing for me right now with my trauma. She gave me a referral to one of her colleagues who I actually already know because of DBT group. The hope is that I would be able to go to her since she does EMDR and is DBT certified. My therapist also believes she does take my insurance because this is another huge factor. I am seeing my current therapist on a sliding scale and my father is helping me pay for it. Most insurances don’t cover DBT and EMDR therapies so this would be great if her colleague takes my insurance so I will not have to borrow money from my father. Anyways, all this to ask if anyone has done EMDR? I’m concerned because it is an intense form of therapy that it may exacerbate the “voices” and “hallucinations” (quotes because I am struggling to grasp that it 
may be happening for me). I will definitely bring up my concerns when the time comes. I just wanted to come here and see if anyone had any personal experiences."

Though I got interviewed and got the dreaded question about how I spend the hours of my day. Can you blog? I think it’s been great for me… I’m almost obsessed with my Sz reputation and also legacy( there are far worse things; in fact it’s probably a good thing). I like memorializing and leaving a foot print and all of that. It’s so uplifting maybe bc I like the videos I also branched into… I even want to watch that dated flick with _NAME_ called My Life … I think it’s called.

176017959,"Well psychiatrists have a lot more schooling than psychologists so you probably are not wrong there. I never said therapy should replace medication, or that it was better than medication. I said that when used with medication, it results in better outcomes for patients. In my opinion until a psychotic person is stabilized on medication therapy is useless. But once their symptoms are under control and they have lucidity back, therapy can help improve medication adherence, help a person recognize triggers and patterns in their life that perpetuate their psychosis, how to better avoid getting into episodes and how to cope if it can’t be avoided. It is true that if you don’t have insurance therapy is pretty much out of the question unfortunately. But then again, a lot of psych meds are really expensive too. For people who are not able to leave their homes to attend therapy for whatever reason teletherapy (over phone) is available. Of course, there are a very very limited number of therapists who sp
ecialize in psychotic disorders to begin with. And a looot of therapists who shouldn’t even be therapists at all in my opinion. I want to be able to provide specialized therapy for others with psychosis eventually."

My diet has been normalizing again, and I’m ready to jump back on the wagon. Its bittersweet. I’m trying to focus on the positives of trying to better myself and get healthy, but I don’t have the same excitement. Its not like the first time losing weight, or even the second or third.

176017976,Hello _AT_MENTION_. Thanks for your reply and kind and inspiring words. Leaves me feeling not quite so alone. You get it. It’s hard when I look at a great life around me that I can’t participate in the way I used to. Or to be the person I once was to my wonderful husband and children. When you say: I’m always trying to regain what I had and was doing before my diagnosis. And accepting where I am right now is the hard part and then building from there might be easier. Those hit me like a ton of bricks. Thanks again. Nice meeting you!

174346268,"As for the topic of the thread, suicidal ideation isn’t solely linked to depression. It is linked to circumstantial issues, schizophrenia, OCD, and pretty much anything else that causes us to feel something undesirable. Of course I’m simplifying it, but it is not mandated to any one illness. It is mostly associated with depression, but it is not solely decided by depression. Also, when people associate it with depression, it isn’t necessarily associated with clinical depression. Many of the things I listed cause depression, but that doesn’t mean someone afflicted with those conditions qualifies for major depressive disorder."

176018038,"The mini lozenges are very good and you don’t go through too many of them because they take so long to melt in your mouth. They give a slow, steady flow of nicotine and it gets you off the nicotine _USER_ID_. It calms down the nicotine fits and stops the urge to smoke. They are quite nice tasting, the mint flavor is good, like a tic tac. And at Rite Aid they are usually on sale for $40 for over 100 of them. I go through about 6-7 of them a day, so you can see it’s much cheaper than vaping or cigarettes. In order to quit smoking I initially used the patches along with the mini lozenges to get my nicotine levels down. I started with the 21 mg patch and worked my way down to 7 mg over the course of 4.5 months. I know it’s expensive to buy both, but in the long run, it will save you money if it works to help you quit."

Having to differentiate between the the real world and illusions. “Prophet” they call out to me, close, zero point next to me, but a realm apart. They keep a close eye on me, protect me. In a way I’m thankful for them, love them, but I don’t know. Wondering how much of consciousness is intermingled with the soul, like I said, remembering is a problem. When the mortal brain dies, so goes all of the memories, it’s those things imprinted onto your soul that you get to take with you. An illusion and a lesson. I wonder how much I will get to keep. Same old fables of being eternal, infinite, whole with all. Flashes of memories, feeling uncomfortable in a flesh prison. Feeling bound, restricted, mortal. Angels who commit an unforgivable sin are punished by living one life. I wonder what my sin was, why I fell. It’s always like waking up from a dream, feeling that energy, it’s pure and wa
rm. How many times have I forgotten this dream when I wake up? Entropic and timelessness, just waiting now. I tell my self it’s not all true, but that rarely helps, it’s the questions that come up. Grandiose and self stroking. Let it go llama, try to believe."

176018093,"Well, maybe I made that assumption because you said you didn’t want anxiety and so basically wanted only opinions that would suit that. Literally all you had to do, was respond to the question. Give your opinion and keep it moving, as opposed to trying to analyse what kind of response I’m after. I wasn’t after any kind of response. you assumed that I ‘belittled’ anxiety and mental health You repeatedly brushed off the fact I’m saying anxiety is a real mental illness, in same way SZ is, that can be very debilitating. It is not a matter of “comfort”, it’s about being able to live your life on a functional level like everyone else. Just because you’re against medication, and psychiatry and the like, it doesn’t cancel out the validity of other mental health issues. And it doesn’t mean we all need to go along with your radical beliefs."

The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a p... I read the wiki article, used my brain, watched YouTube videos, and thought deeply about my time traveling memories and being a former time traveler or whatever you want to call me. Too bad I cannot win a Nobel Prize or get free lifetime supply of Marbolo Red 100 cigarettes and Low-Carb Monster Drinks…never works out, well, rarely…1 in a trillion success rate. Anyways, the two assumpti
ons this principle made are incorrect assumptions. First, we can access parallel timelimes/worldlines and there is definitely more than one worldline. IIRC, if you have a theorem, and the two statements are wrong or underlying argument is wrong, then the whole story fall aparts. Hence, I am right and they are wrong. Third, and my weakest form of evidence, is I remember thinking in a past life when I ‘reincarnated’ or popped into existence via a time bubble or causal loop that the local laws of physics changed because no-one noticed I came back including my father. Even I forgot and resumed my life. Could it be robotics and AI? Am I even human? We can access the multi-verse using Penrose Diagrams. If we had a good time-machine we can access other timelines or ‘dimensions’ using two micro-singularities (kerr-black hole with a negative charge I think), and that creates a tipler sinusoid I think. I have no-where else to post this. I should major in physics but I’m scared and don’t want to go to school
. I’m slow mentally from my condition. I should study relativity from books and create my own knowledge and maybe write papers? Also, according to CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology), the universe infinitely expands and never contracts, which makes sense now and I have updated my thinking lately. Hence, no big crunch or anything. I don’t know how that works with string theory or m theory, but we could be living in an eternal forever expanding universe. Hence, the universe, comes back indefinitely via aeons."

Neuroscientists at Lund University in Sweden have developed a new technology that engineers the shell of a virus to deliver gene therapy to the exact cell type in the body that needs to be treated. With the new method, researchers have been able to significantly reduce the need for laboratory animals, as millions of variants of the same drug are studied in the same individual. They have also been able to move important parts of the study from animals to cell culture of human stem cells. “We believe that the new synthetic virus we succeeded in creating would be very well suited for gene therapy for Parkinson’s disease, for example, and we have high hopes that these virus vector

Grocery bagger Stock clerk Factory/assembly (summer 1998) Federal Work-Study worker, typing a professor’s notes Proofreading a thesis, or maybe it was a dissertation Auto parts warehouse worker (summer 1999) Dishroom/catering/bartending (2nd and 3rd year of college, a little into 4th year) Paper mill (summer 2000) Clerk at a funky, cool variety store (4th year college) Security guard (first job post-med school year) 7-eleven clerk Graduate teaching assistant (for 4 semesters of grad school) Shitty job for which I’m not sure of a title, working at a printing press facility Lab tech at Johns Hopkins (first job post-grad school, failed miserably) Associate scie
ntist (lab tech, really, failed miserably) Back to the same 7-eleven Different factory/assembly job Lab in milk processing facility (failed miserably, quit while in a psych unit) Teaching at a community college (started August 2010, still teaching there) Seasonal employee at a _PERSON_’s-like department store, was treated like ???? (quit while I was in a psych unit) Sunoco gas station A different 7-eleven, this one with gas pumps Retail pharmacy tech, worked there for 2.5 years Hospital inpatient pharmacy tech Foundry, working in “rough grinding” (very physical) and “clay” (less physical) departments. Back to the same Sunoco station as before Back to the 7-eleven that had gas pumps, quit because it freaked me out too much. I worked there only because the Sunoco station was closed for remodeling Back to Sunoco station Taught at a different community college in 2019, failed miserably Holy hell, 29 jobs. Granted, a few of them repeated, like the 7-elevens and the Sunoco station. My teaching job that I 
have held for nearly 10 years is the longest I’ve held a job, and I plan on sticking with that job for years to come. How about y’all? What jobs have you worked?"

176018301,"I wish I had a solution for this. I find it harder to stay focused on my hobbies but I still enjoy them. I just do them in small spurts sometimes. A lot of my day is spent trying to find interesting things to do. I do sometimes lay on the couch and just close my eyes for like fifteen minutes. I don’t know if that’s a symptom or what, I just do it because I get pretty exhausted by everything. I hope it gets better for you somehow. I find comfort food cheers me up and gets me going, like jalapeno poppers and fried mozzarella sticks! I don’t eat big portions but I really enjoy the meals, and each one makes me feel pretty happy for a few hours.

176018305,"One time I was attending a CA meeting by myself. It was a fairly big meeting and I was sitting in the middle of the group behind these three guys I had never seen before. They look like tough characters but so did a lot of people in meetings. I couldn’t help but listen to their conversation and they mentioned one of them was from Texas. I saw an opportunity to use one of my favorite short jokes. I leaned forward and said, “Hey, I just heard they found a new use for sheep in Texas. _PERSON_.” I was just trying to be funny but boy, all three of them just turned around and gave me really unfriendly looks. I mean I was physically scared for a second. Then they just turned back around and ignored me. Man, people can be so touchy, lol."
176018306,The Singing part was fantastic maybe u can do a hook for me bro haha. The rapping lyrics were really good too. I think the flow/delivery is the hardest parts to get down and that’s why it’s regarded as the “it factor” in rap. Seriously it takes a ton of repetitions just like anything else to master the flow regularly on a consistent basis and be able to experiment and switch it up a lot. Keep at it man!!! I thought it was a really cool song and _NAME_. If you can manage to get it more like in bars. Like da na da na da bam boo bam bop. Boom. Like I wanna hear explosions sounds in your verses if you know what I mean??? Just envisioning how it may be has helped me to improve my flow. I wanna hear Gunshots pop pop pop pop in your flow. Bam !!! Just keep that in mind and eventually you’ll be a really fire all around rap musician . All my suggestions will take time. I suggest keeping this song as it is because it’s good already. But I’m saying just envisioning In your head where you wanna be 
soon with the flow has helped me.

Some people even see the mouths of other people moving while they say mean things, but those people never said the mean things. It was all a hallucination. I know it’s scary to admit your brains is tricking you, but I think that’s what happened there.

176018349,"Vraylar might really help you! I’m starting to level out on the anti-depressant but I really wanted to just take Vraylar instead of Abilfy and an SSRI. Vraylar is basically an anti-depressant plus an anti-psychotic in one pill. I’m on the lowest dose of Prozac though so maybe they wanted to see how I react. I just have to eliminate coffee and not overdo anything or stay up all night on purpose. Abilify on its own might not be enough for your negative symptoms, that’s why I had to add an anti-depressant. I take Abilify more as a mood stabilizer and to keep me level, but it doesn’t seem to help as much with negative symptoms. Since adding the Prozac I feel like I’m leveling out and getting a bit better…I’m not manic now after getting sleep. I guess the only thing I’m worried about is my thought process, but I think that was caused by serious lack of sleep than anything else. Hope that helps!"

He wasn’t for everyone but who is, and the group sessions he ran were very amicable for all concerned. I know it sounds strange, but I don’t lie, my life seems to mirror reality because I am so sensitive to the environment, synchronicities abound, as do coincidences, it is all a matter of perspective I guess, there are some good voices out there.

It has stopped my ability to focus. Yet I also understand the need to take it, because the underlying condition [schizophrenia] is very difficult to treat. I recently read a good article it which it claims that psychiatric medications have failed, due to the side effects. I have found it very difficult to work while taking the medication, people claim that you don’t relapse if you take medication but I’ve relapsed on multiple occasions taking the dose. I have yet to find a drug that agrees with me and will be happy if I’m able to lower the dose of my Clopixol to a level where it stops causing harm. The drugs are not addictive, because you don’t get high from taking antipsychotics, but the drugs make you dependent on taking them, which means it’s almost impossible to have them withdrawn."

176018386,"Have you tried employment agencies? That can be a really good way to go sometimes. If you use an agency they usually partner with a bunch of businesses to find workers. You go to the agency, fill out an initial application, show them a resume and than they do all the work of finding a job for you. I’'ve used several with moderate success. It might be good for your situation so instead of driving or taking the bus all over looking for a place or making a bunch of phone calls looking for a job with the hours you want, when you""re talking to a worker at the agency, tell them you specifically only want 10 or 12 hours. Then they will eliminate looking for companies for you who only want full time workers. Temp agencies are good too if you just want to just work for a few days or a week or two to make some money while you look fot other jobs. And of course everybody knows that if you are working a temp job somewhere, if they like you and your work it can often turn into a permanent position."

About a few hours ago, I started to have intense voices and visual hallucinations. I had a shadow who was repeatedly chocking and torturing me, and I was gasping for breath. It said that if I don’t kill myself, it will kill me. I fought against this hallucination for two hours. Later, the bugs started to appear on my legs. I started to panic and I tried so hard to take off the shadows. The bugs were crawling, I was choking and gasping for breath, and the voices were shouting at me and commanding me to kill myself. Someone was helping me through this as I was having one and he saved my life. He talked me through it and after we hung up I found all of my joints twisted from putting too much strength on them. I could barely use my right feet. I told my mom that my ankles were twisting, and she put me on braces right away. Now I’m resting and trying to k
eep away from the hallcination who is hesitating if it should keep choking me or not. This really sucked but I made it through and I am so grateful.

176018465,hi _AT_MENTION_ I don’t think the govt is after you. I think you’re paranoid & delusional. I agree with the others on the thread - talk to someone you can trust or see your pdoc & get your meds adjusted. Buying a house where I live is paying off a 20 year mortgage. I did that & now I live mortgage free & it’s nice. My paranoia was never about govt or house-buying. House buying is an area you need to be savvy in or you’ll have a mortgage & debt that is too much for you to pay reasonably. My paranoia was always about my family (mother) wanting to psychologically torture me. Unfortunately that was true in reality. But anti-psychotics helped me to see that clearly.

174346399,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Alteration of the gut microbiome in first-episode drug-naïve and chronic medicated schizophrenia correlate with regional brain volumes. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ He, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of psychiatric research, Feb 2020 08 The human gut microbiome plays an important role in the basic neurodevelopmental processes of the central nervous system and has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the connection between the gut microbiome and the underlying pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly defined. Here we analyzed the faecal samples from 40 first-episode drug-naïve SCZ (FSCZ) patients, 85 chronically antipsychotic-treated SCZ (TSCZ) patients and 69 healthy controls (HCs) using 16S rRNA gene sequence to determine whether the alterations of the gut microbiome were associated with SCZ or antipsychotic treatment. In addition, we acquired the T1-weighted brain imaging data 
by using structural magnetic resonance imaging to test whether microbial composition correlated with structural brain signatures. Our analyses revealed low microbiome alpha-diversity indexes in TSCZ patients but not in FSCZ patients as compared to HCs. Importantly, both FSCZ and TSCZ patients had distinct changes in gut microbial composition at certain taxa including Christensenellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Turicibacteraceae at the family level and Escherichia at genus level as compared to HCs. We also found significant disturbances of gut microbial composition in TSCZ versus FSCZ patients (eg. Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae). Most interestingly, our exploratory analyses found specific SCZ-associated microbiota to be correlated with the right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) volume which was aberrant in SCZ patients. Our findings extend prior work and suggest a possible link between the gut microbiome and brain structure which may be implicated in the pathology of SCZ."

176018506,"Thanks for sharing everyone. Yesterday I ran a quick mile on the treadmill. It was a bad idea, my big toe injury called sesamoiditis started acting up. I had tried an easy slower jog last week at night (I’ve been paranoid to go out). There was no pain at all. Yesterday I overdid it! Today I iced and elevated my big toe joint…I might take a few weeks off to let my foot bounce back, though I’ll try and keep moving…always with shoes on in the house. I also make sure to take acetaminophen. I bought a pair of basketball shoes on amazon, they’re here and they fit great. I’ll wear them and my running shoes around the house to break them in. I’m manic, so I’ve gotta watch out for spending. It’s all about that cabbage! The bank, the beans, the _NAME_, the jive, the moolah, the greenbacks, the dead presidents. My sesamoid also will get messed up if I go barefoot. There’s a basketball court at the fitness center (I’m too self conscious to go) but there’s also one next to the park nearb
y. It’s close, dark and private. It has hard concrete ground. I read jumping is a great way to maintain bone density. Basketball is a series of small jumps. Tall guys can reach the goal quicker and without fail, so they’re always the best. I messed my foot up doing bad exercises in bad equipment. I may need up to a month to let the sesamoids bounce back. They are sensitive. The tendons surrounding them are inflamed. I’m not sure what you do for that…I’m trying to strengthen my calves…maybe my quads too. As for jogging, it’ll be jogging and not “running” as such. No timer, and a high frequency of short choppy steps. Bouncy and under the center of gravity with no reaching. Nsaids like acetaminophen are key, I think, to healing in this time. Yesterday I learned a new exercise for the neck called a neck curl… You lay down with your head hanging off the bench and hold a light plate (wrapped in cloth) against your head as you lift your neck. Keep the abs out of it (anterior pelvic tilt-lumbar ex
tension) for the back, do it on your sides, back, and belly, lightly roll and stretch your neck out first. Otherwise, next couple weeks: Walking in the house, possibly light jogging (tentative), acetaminophen, raise and ice the foot 2x/day for 30min at a time."

Aripiprazole (ARP), which is one of second-generation antipsychotics, has been reported to lower serum prolactin (PRL) levels. However, few studies have compared the effect of ARP on plasma PRL levels between monopharmacy and polypharmacy with antipsychotics.We conducted a large-scale investigation of the physical risk for inpatients with schizophrenia using a questionnaire covering demographic data, the number, dose and type of antipsychotics, and serum PRL levels.Sufficient data to conduct an assessment of the effect on PRL levels between antipsychotic monopharmacy and polypharmacy were obtained from 316 of the inpatients

She said I was doing good. First thing I say to her when we meet is “Hello doctor X, I’m still getting voices, still seeing things.” I’ve said it exactly like that three meetings. Her response normally is “hu?” And she scribbles down one word. She doesn’t allow me to discuss my hallucinations in detail, she always cuts me off and asks how therapy is, or if I’m sleeping. She hasn’t sent me for any diagnostic tests to rule out tumors or lesions. But she won’t discuss what she thinks or my diagnosis"

176018597,Risperdal didn’t work for me either. I had poverty of thought and couldn’t function to a good level. My point is I tried a couple of others and found something that worked better. That is the choice these days as there’s other alternatives. Talk to your doctor and maybe try something else if you can…it can make a world of difference.

On Abilify I was closer to normal and I had pleasure doing stuff. Now even the easiest thing playing video games doesn’t give me pleasure, I try to play 1-2x/week. I loose focus fast. The anhedonia is too severe on anything other than Abilify. I stopped Abilify because it gave me multiple addiction issues to gambling, sex, shopping and eating."
176018602,"My regrets get to me when I’m vulnerable, which means medication wore off. But aside from that I respond behavior cognitive therapy to regret loops by invalidating them: they are not even thinking about me, it’s been years since happened, can’t change the past, has little if any relevance now. To each and every time. I hope you can find a way to get relief of this, because it’s like prison sentence not deserved. Acknowledge the brain loop, a tick, and live your life despite that. We’re supposed to live in the here and now, not past. The best thing my psychiatrist told me is that regrets are “an abject waste of time.”"

176018612,"Yeah that’s what I did too…Good luck getting your pdoc to lower the dose, but in my experience they are twice as likely to agree to let you try a different med than lowering the dose of the one you’re on, unless you’ve been stable for a while.

I am at IOP for exposure therapy for ocd. They explained emailing my therapist is a part of an obsession and compulsion cycle. They wanted to just cut it off (have my husband change my email password) and they contacted my therapist and told him never to respond to me BUT My therapist disagreed with cutting off communication with me. He’s worried there will be an emergency and if I don’t think he will respond, I won’t reach out. So, we plan to talk about it at IOP again this week, and my therapist is going to talk with them more. It’s a hard situation. I email him too much, but if I stop, it’s risky. Does that make sense?"

However, if you believe you do fulfill all BFOQs for the job of dental hygienist, the _NAME_ requires an employer to make meaningful accommodations (specialized training, flexible schedule, reassignment, etc.) unless these accommodations constitute an undue hardship on the employer.

174346483,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov _NAME_-analysis of genomic variants and gene expression data in schizophrenia suggests the potential need for adjunctive therapeutic interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of genetics , Jun 2019 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating mental illness with a multigenic aetiology and significant heritability. Despite extensive genetic studies, the molecular aetiology has remained enigmatic. A recent systems biology study suggested a protein-protein interaction network for SZ with 504 novel interactions. The onset of psychiatric disorders is predominant during adolescence, often accompanied by subtle structural abnormalities in multiple regions of the brain. The availability of BrainSpan Atlas data allowed us to re-examine the genes present in the SZ interactome as a function of space and time. The availability of genomes of healthy centenarians and nonpsychiatric Exome Aggregation Consortium database allowed us 
to identify the variants of criticality. The expression of the SZ candidate genes responsible for cognition and disease onset was studied in different brain regions during particular developmental stages. A subset of novel interactors detected in the network was further validated using gene expression data of post-mortem brains of patients with psychiatric illness. We have narrowed down the list of drug targets proposed by theprevious interactome study to 10 proteins. These proteins belonging to 81 biological pathways are targeted by 34 known Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that have distinct potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We also report the possibility of targeting key genes belonging to celecoxib pharmacodynamics, G? signalling and cGMP-PKG signalling pathwaysthat are not known to be specific to SZ aetiology.

176018775,"Aim: The aim was to study the brain connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) among patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) and compare the same with a group of patients without TRS. Methods: Twenty-three patients with TRS and 15 patients without TRS underwent DTI using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging machine. DTI data were processed with the calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient. Patients were also assessed on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Clinical Global Impression severity scale. Results: Patients with TRS and non-TRS differed significantly in the FA values in the region of right superior longitudinal fasciculus and right uncinate fasciculus, with more integrity of tracts in the non-TRS group. However, these differences disappeared when _PERSON_ correction was used for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: The present study suggests lack of significant diffe

176018776,"When I’m hypo manic I sleep like 3-4 hours, I gamble and use drugs and am very sexual. My thoughts are too fast as well as speech. I have little insight and really can’t understand why people are worried or annoyed. And yes, there’s a feeling of euphoria."
176018777,I have some panicky feelings at night that someone is going to break in and I don’t really know how to deal with it either. I usually just try to watch an asmr video and distract myself.
176018778,You have nicotine receptors in your brain. I think some have more or are more activated than others but it does hook into your brain pretty easily. Champix works but being a partial agonist/antagonist…not sure the right term but it jumps onto nictotine receptors and drops off. It confuses the receptor into being occupied when it’s not…that is how my shrink described it’s action. It worked well for me.
176018779,"I’m not saying that to be nice, either"
176018780,Sometimes I want to go to sleep and not wake up. To not have to deal with anything in life no more. No more pain no more stress no more paranoia no more awkwardness no more struggling no more being alone to finally have rest and peace. Now I know theres no such thing as hell it’s much easier. The only reason why I’m still fighting is because of my kids but I’m tired. I’m still fighting to be here for them and doing the best that I can trying to give them the best life I never had but I dont want to be here I’m tired of struggling and suffering and being alone because of this illness.
176018781,My wife and I are getting divorced because she doesn’t want to be with me if I won’t “get better.”
174346484,Wow that’s crazy. Just goes to show everyone is so different. I did have bad weight gain on zyprexa though too. That was the second worst for that.
176018782,What’s going on with you? How have you been? Is everything going ok?
176018783,I want to successfully get through life too.
176018784,I believe some people like me sometimes but my brain can’t handle being liked to much. It overloads my brain. I had a really good phone meeting with my case worker about two months ago. It just went really well and I surprised her by saying a few funny things and she even laughed and told me I’m funny and the rest of the interview went great. I needed to talk to her two weeks later and I called and when she picked up the phone she was really happy to hear from me and was really friendly. As soon as I realized it shocked me and I folded like a cheap suit. I couldn’t handle it. I hemmed and hawed through the rest of the phone call and it turned her off. She was still polite but I know she was wondering what was going on. This still happens but not all the time. I really liked her though and making myself and her look bad really depressed me.
176018785,Cool!! It’s so funny because I think bouncing off you I had a short lived and narrow form of psychosis. It’s all the past of course and I like having new type thoughts to think. Really like philosophy in a philosophical way; didn’t take to the famed ones in college I mean by that. Haha.

176018791,"Yes they have told me a few times saying, “You will die today.” Other times they say they will kill me on my birthday (though I believe this is a metaphysical term when they implied my birthday, not my physical birth). Last night they told me I killed myself. They always keep me in flight or fight mode and I am always terrified because of these entities."
176018792,"But you don’t have to live with me. I need a lot of care. But, over the years, I’ve learned things that I love to share with you."
174346486,"Probably more than I used to. Around 2001-2002 my shrink took me off prolixen because of the risk of TD. We tried abilify, seroquel, Geodon, and finally settled on risperidone. I wasn’t overly scared. Maybe a little wary. I think I would be more hesitant now about trying new medication. I would not want to try a different medication, but I would do it if I had to."
176018793,"So you are saying you made 1,000 nonsense posts? I’m probably in the same boat as you."
176018794,Thank you for telling me that. I’ll try to find a piano-violin duet of Serenata on YouTube.com
176018795,Yes it still happens on meds but much less intense. I get thoughts of insulting my parents for no reason or bad sexual thoughts etc I learned to ignore them and distract myself. They’re caused by inappropriate emotions probably caused by dopamine imbalance.

176018799,"Vaping was more difficult to give up than cigarettes for me as well. I think it’s because vaping is providing the same chemical boost, but without the bad smell, taste, and carcinogens (as far as we know). Also, I was able to vape indoors, rather than going outside to smoke. It became a comfort to me, and I would puff on it constantly. It was as much addictive psychologically as physically. If you find this is also the case for you, consider adopting another habit in place of vaping. I liked chewing regular spearmint gum, but having a silicone chew toy (yes, chew toy) also helped."
176018800,There must have been a good reason why you were sectioned. Sectioning is not done on a whim. As for not being properly cared for: There is certainly a gap between how care in the community does function and how it should function . That comes down to a woeful lack of funding and resources .

It’s hard to tell."
174346492,"My parents are moderately rich, they have 3 houses with backyards (not appartments). Schizophrenia didn’t affect me financially at all, I still buy what I want like a 2080Ti etc, my parents pay for me.

I’ll let you in on a secret: I’ve been at my janitors job four years and half the time I walk around and I’m totally crazy and in my own world. But no one seems to notice so maybe I’ll work there another four years, lol. It’s possible to work while having symptoms, and you would be surprised how little people notice about someone else. Hopefully, other people in the presentation just think thought you were nervous."

I’m laughing because I understand how you feel. Like something must be wrong, I need to go to the doctor for being happy!"

176018816,Thanks a lot nijastar. You seem to know a lot.
176018817,I have improved over the years though. Some meds actually improve my mental illness and decline like Vraylar. The downside is the weight gain and eating more. I still cannot seem to have a decent schedule and stay organized. I struggle to do basic things around the house and lose sight of the larger picture like working and moving forward with my life. I talk a lot about school but never can seem to get the courage or force to do it.

Don’t it tho when you hate that you don’t really hate some one who doesn’t hate anyone or wish I’ll apon anyone for that matter and doesn’t even bother anyone or prevoke this kind of mostly negative treatment although I will admit you guys are very intertaining and some of you are very beautiful .

176018826,I don’t know if they’ll let me back into the nursing home. I picked a fight with a nurse tech. My mom said they’ll let me in.
176018827,"I don’t. At most of my jobs I worked whatever hours they asked me to. I worked morning shifts and night shifts at my jobs. I tried working graveyard at Target. I did it for 8 months but I never liked it. It disrupted my life because I only had a couple days off and needed to plan when to sleep and when to do necessary business. I had only a very narrow window to take care of stuff like doctors appointments or going to the local Social Security office or going to the DMV etc. I always thought it would be cool to work graveyard but it wasn’t. Anyways, ever since I started filling out job applications at age 17, they always ask you what days and hours you are willing to work. And my own personal response was always “any”. I think that impresses an employer. In my 37 or 38 years of working I always worked whatever hours they gave me. So I worked full time if they asked me at several jobs. I worked full time as a park ranger sometimes or unloading trucks at Sears. If they told me I was going to 
work just 20 hours a week I did it. If they had me work overtime or come in early, I did it. If they gave me 40 hours on the schedule, I did it. But the difference between us is that I’m a lot older. It slows me down. I work 16 hours a week. If they ask me if I want to come in on my day off, I have no qualms about saying no. If they offer to let me go an hour early, they know I’m going to say yes. My damn knees and bad back kind of dictate my decisions now. Sorry, I guess this doesn’t help. I’ll just say that 40 hours is a lot to take on. If you try I would just say have a cushion or backup plan."

176018839,Actually I imagine they would. When food goes bad we recognize it immediately (usually…) and isn’t that because the bacteria that starts to grow on it? I think that’s pretty cool when you think about it? Our senses of some things are not that acute as other species. Which is also cool. It’s like our senses are mostly attuned to what we’re focusing on too. Some people don’t like some smells and for others they may love them. Sometimes we don’t know when something goes bad and some people are better at noticing it.

But something to do with not being on invega anymore made me want to keep showering more regularly since that day, and I’ve been keeping to the new schedule ever since (which is showering every other day) I also joined a gym, and I find that I have the motivation to keep going every workout day. You can find me in the gym 4 to 5 days a week. My akathisia is better, altough I still have it a little bit. One day, after my japanese class was over, I felt a random outburst of positive emotion.

This year it took place an Zoom. The woman I talked to was the doctor asking questions and she looked like…well, a doctor. Wearing a white coat and looking very serious. Most of it was simple yes or no questions. Near the end she stopped and she said, “You know, I’ve been wanting to tell you that I think you are a very strong person and a very strong man.” She says, “I admire what you do, despite having the limitations of your disease.” I was taken aback. She had been so clinical and strictly business up to that point. I have to admit it made me feel really good. It made me like her a lot more too.

You can go outside and pick fresh dandelions and chicory. You roast the roots and their caffeine free. I blend it with regular coffee.

My moms first boyfriend put me through a lot of psychical abuse he’d beat the crap out of me when my mom wasn’t around. I think it’s part of the reason I had no fear growing up. When you get beat by a grown man not much else scares you. My neighbor blew his pregnant wifes head off with a shotgun. My best friends dad hung himself in the front yard and we all saw it on the way to school. I mean I saw a lot there’s even more.

We’ll go out in a few weeks and resolve all this. I came on here maybe to speed things but it doesn’t matter. Thank you for your responses but I am now happy to end this discussion. I never really needed any help, I was just looking to move things on more quickly. From now on I am discussing this subject with my real world colleagues. Thank you."

176019160,I hate intrusive thoughts even though they are someone inserting them to my mind most of the times. I don’t know if people know anything about intrusive thoughts. But i know we have them without thinking.
176019161,Finish all my work Go to game night and have fun (Only two I guess)
176019162,Sounds a good strategy. I’ve always looked for best function and have tried many drugs and dosages before settling on my current regime. Some I won on. Some I really did lose on but overall I’m happy and relatively stable and that is worth the effort. Talk to your doc!

176019167,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. Was alaykum salaam I can also wear hijab (headscarf) the way I like - covering head but not neck (hubby wanted me to always cover neck) and wear hippie necklaces And I have MUCH more free time alone so it would be easier to get a job as I’d be bored if I don’t And I can listen to music with others openly (I used to have to do it in secret) I’m planning on applying for disability True!

I wouldnt feel bad about smoking though i heard 90 % of schizophrenics smoke. It relieves the stress a bit."
176019176,"maybe we should keep our opinions tto ourself/ idk why people get all tied up over what someone says, its would be ok to protest if it was really bad or offensive if it was bad but apart from that i dont see the harm, constructive critisism, meaningful debate, challenging thoughts? whats so bad about that? it is supposed to strengthen peoples thoughts and attitudes isnt it?"
174346569,10 months and i was off meds. For some reason not having to deal with secondary negative symptoms allowed me to do activities and ignore the paranoia. On meds i last about 3 months on average. I got my diagnosis three years ago and have been in hospital a lot. Lots of 3 day stays to keep me safe from suicide mostly. And quite a few 2 weeks stays for med changes.
174346571,"I felt very confused and scared. So last night I had this sudden, overwhelming feeling of terror. I couldn’t catch my breath. I felt so alone and like someone was going to get me. I don’t know if it’s stress or a flare up of schizophrenia. I’m better now, I too two Ativan to help me sleep. What could it be?"

174346574,"I meet with my NP this Thursday to discuss relapse prevention. I decided to schedule an appt with her to do the planning due to recent relapse fears. I am doing well – no current positive symptoms – but I did have a fleeting paranoid thought a week or so ago. I don’t know if this is just my brain re-adjusting or ramping up for something. The problem I find with relapse planning is I do not know exactly what I am planning for. Will it be the same thing the occurred before or something different? I know that sleep disturbances are common in relapse, but my sleep was great until I was put on medication. Also, I don’t think I’d be willing to go on the same AP I was on before so I guess I would need to plan for a different one, but there would be no guarantee of it working. Is this just the nature of the beast? Also, if people could be supportive rather than pessimistic, I’d appreciate it. If there are any practical, concrete ways to plan that have been useful and assuaged fears, I’d espec
ially welcome them."

I could say that it’s a delusion because I dont feel any cameras or anything on my body, and I dont feel anything under my skin, but I hear the tv talking to me. Everyone I encounter makes negative comments to me as well. I talked to my psychiatrist about this but I dont believe her because what I’m experiencing tells me otherwise. Sucks I know. It has been going on for almost 3 years. I dont believe battery operated hidden cameras could last that long. Unless it’s a wifi camera.

Fat for satiety. Eating purely protein can make you feel very crummy without fat, it’s documented. Fat had been unfairly demonized. Also since there are so many kinds of fat, it’s not fair to label all fat as bad, but linoleic and oleic fatty acids are suspect for causing metabolic dysfunction.

In his case things were further complicated by hiv which he’s had for over 25 years . About 4-5 years ago he developed hiv related psychosis. How much of the psychosis was due to years of cannabis and/or the HIV is debatable .

174346590,"To sum it up. I think either a rich man targeted me or I posted on Facebook that there was a nuclear war in 2011 at uc berkeley after I smoked pot and had my near death experience. I was high as a kite and blacked out and psychotic. I thought I was being witty, intelligent, and smart about reality and philosophy. It got the wrong attention. I think I was tortured. I got kidnapped. Sometimes, I think they covered it up by sending me back in time or took me to another earth similar or exactly as my own. Felt like I even went to Mars too. Something like mk ultra or worse. I was told I was a super soldier, vampire, and that I was in monarch and montauk. I often think some girls father was a high ranking government worker based on my past life memories… Years later I discovered I was _NAME_ titor. I’m not sure if I posted that stuff In this reality or a past life. Maybe aliens abducted me? Not sure. But I remember something happening. I apologized and still do. Basically there was a war with China a
nd Russia. I posted that and we ended up in a computer simulation or that was my theory…and that we all died… But we didn’t, i guess? Apparently we won but I still am crazy. I also was playing a music video pretty loud. Some other stuff happened too. I keep on coming back alive in the year 2013 after I dropped out of college via soul reincarnation. I dont know if it’s a causal loop or a time loop. I was told it was a causal loop, but my gut instinct says time loop. I’ve lived billions or trillions of lives. Evenn was in the illuminati before. Found out it is evil and left. I was tortured and killed millions of times by the aliens and illuminati, I guess. Definitely aliens. Mostly at the mental hospital. Felt like hell or worse. I needed psychiatric help at Berkeley. Never got it. I’m Christian now. I’m in a time loop. Not sure what else to add. I was the first to mention or freely talk about simulation theory. I had negative experiences with greys, reptilians, and the shadow government/illuminat
i/deep state. I’ve been to other realities that are slightly different. They did experiments on me too. Turned me and my family into aliens. Realized im a nobody schizophrenic. Took me out of the simulation. I hate having schizophrenia because its for eternity. I also like philosophy and helping others by talking about my theories. I don’t have schizophrenia outside the simulation. They cured it for me. I sometimes think we are living in end times now. I’m a Christian now and God protects me. I sometimes want money too. I was also a Milab. Been to dumbs like _NAME_. I’m experiencing consciousness transfer. Any of that help or make sense?"

If memory serves it was first introduced by _NAME_ when trying to emphasise the cultural and ethnic commonalities between the French and the Spanish at a time when they imposed emperor _PERSON_ on the Mexican people. “Latin” has changed meaning in Europe a number of times, since its original etymology which can be traced back to the Latium region in central Italy. Later it would refer to the western _NAME_ empire, and later still to Catholic nations in Southern and central Europe, including Belgium (Wallonia to be precise) and Romania. The history of how the word Latin and Latino has been used throughout history is convoluted beyond belief. My observations about what goes on now in the States is based on the US immigration authorities’ guidelines which define “Hispanic” as an ethnic group (sic), and then goes on to break down this category into different race groups (White Hispanic, Black Hispanic, etc.)."

I have aquired a program that blocks the webbrowsers from opening at specific times. I have a block set up from 4.30pm to 8am the following day, every tuesday, thursday and sunday. The reason I am doing this is because I tried it before and I became much more at ease in my head with less time online. I believe that im my case, spending too much time on the computer is contributing to negative mental health. I have a addiction problem with the internet. Basically I am forcing myself to do something else, which might seem hard at first, but it becomes a habit after a while."

What’s is demonstrably naive, is to believe that we are own makers, an unconsciously liberal (in the European sense of the word) prejudice. You’re ignoring what neuroscientists and philosophers of the mind are telling us, and instead, you offer a muddled statement about self-control being “under significant indirect control”. Indirect how? That’s precisely what I’m addressing."

I believe I’m inept and unworthy compared to most people and I’ll just embarrass myself in public. I just don’t think people would like to be friends with me.

174346602,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Deep brain stimulation in treatment resistant schizophrenia: A pilot randomized cross-over clinical trial. I _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, A _NAME_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, EBioMedicine, Jan 2020 08 Up to 30% of patients with schizophrenia are resistant to antipsychotic drug treatment, with 60% of such cases also failing to respond to clozapine. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used in treatment resistant patients with other psychiatric disorders, but there is a lack of trials in schizophrenia, partly due to uncertainties over where to site the electrodes. This trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subgenual ACC) targeted DBS; the primary outcome measure was PANSS total score, as assessed fortnightly.Eight patients with schizophrenia, who met criteria for treatment resistance and were also resis
tant to/intolerant of clozapine, were randomly assigned using central allocation to receive DBS in the NAcc or subgenual ACC. An open stabilization phase lasting at least six months was followed by a randomized double-blind crossover phase lasting 24 weeks in those who met symptomatic improvement criteria. The primary end-point was a 25% improvement in PANSS total score. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02377505; trial completed).One implanted patient did not receive DBS due to complications of surgery. Of the remaining 7 patients, 2/3 with NAcc and 2/4 with subgenual ACC electrode placements met the symptomatic improvement criteria (58% and 86%, and 37% and 68% improvement in PANSS total score, respectively). Three of these patients entered the crossover phase and all showed worsening when the stimulation was discontinued. The fourth patient worsened after the current was switched off accidentally without her or the investigators' knowledge. Physical adverse events were uncommon, but two patients developed 
persistent psychiatric adverse effects (negative symptoms/apathy and mood instability, respectively).These preliminary findings point to the possibility of DBS having therapeutic effects in patients with schizophrenia who do not respond to any other treatment. Larger trials with careful attention to blinding will be necessary to establish the extent of the benefits and whether these can be achieved without psychiatric side-effects."

176019288,"Hello! Sure, I can explain how to meditate. The type I do is shamatha which then naturally flows into vipassana. Shamatha is a type of mediation where the aim is to focus on your breathing as it is naturally, then once you have a steady focus on the breath you might notice sounds around you or think about something or feel emotions, the aim of vipassana is to observe (vipassana means ‘clear- seeing’). So to start of with shamatha. Take a seat either on a cushion or on a chair. if you a sitting on a chair place your feet gently on the floor with legs uncrossed. Make sure that your back is straight and place your palms naturally on your thighs (just so that they sit nicely). tuck your chin in and look at a spot in front of you without focusing on it. Now notice how your body feels sitting on the chair or cushion. Notice the contact you make with the cushion or chair. Begin to notice your breathing. You can station your awareness at your belly or focus on the breath coming in and going out of your 
nose. You will probably find that your attention wanders to a thought rather than focusing on the breath, don’t worry. Just bring your attention gently back to your breathing. You will probably have to do this lots of times, but don’t worry. Just go back to your breath. Eventually you will be able to focus on your breath naturally and observe your thoughts, and things around you at the same time. This can be really interesting. You may start seeing the past in a different light, or accepting something or feel gratitude for your blessings. Best of luck!"

I’ve been on four different mood stabilizers: Depakote, lithium, Tegretol, and Lamictal (current med). I’ve been on eight different AD’s: Prozac, Wellbutrin (current med), Effexor, Celexa, Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil, and Cymbalta (current med). I’ve been on four different anxiety meds: Klonopin, Ativan, Vistaril and Buspar. If I did the math right in my head, that’s 24 different psych meds. I’m not counting the sleep med (trazodone) I’ve taken, even though it’s an AD, or the propranolol or Cogentin taken for side effects.

It made my anxiety completely go away. For almost 20 years I had to be right with my husband in a store. Never wandered off to browse. My first day on Lion’s Mane I walked off from my husband in a Walmart and browsed the entire time alone. I had forgotten I took the pill and after we were on our way home my husband mentioned he was shocked I went off by myself. I thought about all the things I did that day and the only difference was the Lion’s Mane. Even after _PERSON_ taking it my anxiety didn’t come back for months.

176019371,I’m getting mine in a week.
176019372,I sometimes see light or shadow and describe it as seeing person. What does eleborate paranoia on impulse mean to you. Is it bad thing to have in medical file or disability file
176019373,Negatives bite and it sounds like those. Got to keep fighting. Little steps but do 30 minutes of brisk walking 3 times a week. You’d be surprised how easy it becomes and your back in the game!

174346634,"TL;dr: Kininogen-1 had a sensitivity of 95.1% and a specificity of 97.1% in SCZ prediction. In medical diagnosis, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). This is not a test that is available to the public and if it ever becomes available, it won’t be for years because they’re going to have to test and test it. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Kininogen-1 as a protein biomarker for schizophrenia through mass spectrometry and genetic association analyses. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PeerJ , 2019 Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex and severe mental illness. There is a lack of effective biomarkers for SCZ diagnosis. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of using serum peptides for the diagnosis of SCZ as well as analyze the association of v
ariants in genes coding for these peptides and SCZ.After bead-based fractionation, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry technique was used to identify peptides that showed different expressions between 166 SCZ patients and 201 healthy controls. Differentially expressed peptides were verified in a second set of samples (81 SCZ patients and 103 healthy controls). The association of SCZ and three tagSNPs selected in genes coding for differentially expressed peptides was performed in 1,126 SCZ patients and 1,168 controls.The expression level of peptides with m/z 1,945.07 was significant lower in SCZ patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.000001). The peptide with m/z 1,945.07 was confirmed to be a fragment of Kininogen-1. In the verification tests, Kininogen-1 had a sensitivity of 95.1% and a specificity of 97.1% in SCZ prediction. Among the three tagSNPs (rs_PHONE_NO_, rs2983639, rs2983640) selected in the Cystatin 9 gene (CST9) which encodes peptides including Kinin
ogen-1, tagSNP rs2983640 had its genotype distributions significantly different between SCZ patients and controls under different genetic models (P < 0.05). Haplotypes CG (rs2983639-rs2983640) and TCG (rs13037490-rs2983639-rs2983640) were significantly associated with SCZ (CG: OR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.02-1.44], P = 0.032; TCG: OR = 24.85, 95% CI [5.98-103.17], P < 0.0001).The present study demonstrated that SCZ patients had decreased expression of Kininogen-1 and genetic variants in Kininogen-1 coding gene CST9 were significantly associated with SCZ. The findings from both protein and genetic association studies suggest that Kininogen-1 could be a biomarker of SCZ.

176019401,"I usually came in medfree and totally psychotic and came out as an oversedated zombie. They would start me on high doses of medication and i would get off the medication the first day when i got out. Neither of them was a good idea. If you come in a bit more “controlled” and voluntarily and before things go completely wrong, you have more of a say in medication decisions. Which is a better idea."
176019402,I go off alcohol for almost ten years. Drinking alcohol make me headache.
174346632,Its a schizophrenia med? Its a sodium-channel blocker without affecting dopamine but still Wikipedia says its used to treat schizophrenia. Never heard of it.
176019403,_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry for the abuse you went through. I think you’re very brave to talk about it openly and it will help you heal to do so. I hope the healing comes soon.
174346633,Good thing. How much would that suck? Blind and schizophrenic.
176019404,I’ve had ocd before. It was pre psychosis but I’d be checking windows and doors constantly. Saying that though I think my ex Mrs was low bi polar. Never diagnosed although has seen a shrink. She’d get wildly obsessive about things and you couldn’t detrain her thoughts. I think it could be a symptom or sz aff or sz or even bipolar. As always it’s about limits to your function. If it’s stopping you from living well then it’s a problem to bring up with doc!

176019434,Ah - don’t worry about it. The research suggests that Clozaril is the one medication that also targets the same receptor that sarcosine does - so people on that medication don’t see any additional benefit from sarcosine (from what research I’ve seen on this issue).

176019495,"I don’t believe my delusions are true, which I think is similar, considering its a false belief…until I’m delusional, a period where I become slightly confused feel a bit of euphoria and generally feel “loose” I think that, as far as being delusional goes…that periodic delusionalness is the way to go. Long term is way no bueno."
174346664,"My doctor has just switched me from the abilify injection to pills. He says to take it at night, But when I started the injection, I had a lot of restlessness and anxiety. I’m not sure if it will be sedating, like he says, Or activating, like the shots. What are your experiences?"
176019496,Its not lol I stopped it long time ago and it didn’t improve anything other than giving me itching.
176019497,Keep it up! I don’t think psychiatry is thorough enough when it comes to mental disorder treatment. You could find something that works for you. But do keep your pdoc in the loop with what you’re taking.
176019498,"Yeah, I caught that too. Screw it, I know what he meant."
174346667,How long did your delusions last and is schizophrenia like a walking dream? Also what would happen if I stopped my medicine?

176019501,"the nice thing about our bus is you call when you want a ride and they come and get you, it’s not a scheduled time. So today I called her and she said she would be in in 5 minutes and took me right to the hospital and no one else was on the bus. Then to be picked up I had to wait 15 minutes and there was 1 person, but we went right to the Chevron where I wanted to be dropped off. So It’s a little different here, it’s like a taxi in a way. For $1 per ride. I should use it more. I will now that I’m not afraid anymore."

176019506,"I used to get that before I found the right medication, I would be totally fine and then some minor thing would happen or nothing would happen and out of nowhere I’d be like I want to die. Mental illness is just weird. But meds took it away."
176019507,Good luck! I don’t like socializing so I don’t go to a support group. This website works for me best.
176019508,This happened to me when I was 17. Very debilitating. I hope it hasn’t came back!

174346672,"As long as you have control over your positive symptoms no need to worry. Its when things go out of control then require urgent treatment options like using stronger AP, increasing dose etc. Its a trade off between less negatives with more positives and if its fine then no problem."

176019517,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ do you have side effects guys?
174346677,Do Abilify or Seroquel cause cognitive dysfunction? I am on both.
176019518,"I’m prejudiced against _NAME_ because my first pdoc told me he genuinely believed he was the reincarnation of _NAME_. He prescribed me antidepressants that made me absolutely bonkers. Did not like the guy. Vegetarianism isn’t hard for me. If I eat meat, I become violently ill, almost to the point of needing the hospital. It has been a great deterrant. The trick is not to eat fake meat substitutes, because they all taste just enough like meat to make you keep craving it. Instead, go for dishes that emphasize the natural flavors and spices of plants. After 7 years vegetarian, I did not have meat cravings until I started eating the impossible burger meat. It tastes just enough like meat to make me miss eating meat."
176019519,I think _AT_MENTION_ was joking. He was referring to the phrase “college with MI” in the thread title and (jokingly) reading that phrase as meaning the college has MI.
176019520,I managed to wake up this morning to get my daughter to school even though I felt sore and exhausted. I’m making spaghetti and garlic toast for supper. Both kid approved. Once I pick up the blender I’m going to make a giant smoothie for the 3 of us.

It’s almost 12am, and it’s a therapist appointment tomorrow. I have no prn antibiotics, my pdoc said she wouldn’t give me haldol and cut back on the caffeine. It’s not sz though she is the one causing all this when she saw me last week. It’s been happening for years. I have so much proof"

174346683,"Bottom line is if you have given up, you need to find some acceptance in that, otherwise it seems you will have to find another way to improve your life. If it bothered you enough, you would have done something about it by now. I can tell you now that when my meds affected me like they do you, I stopped taking them, and they had to adjust my meds until I became compliant and happy with side effects. Blaming negative symptoms constantly is not going to help you. If you want to do more, force yourself."
176019532,"I started taking my benzo in morning and I have noticed I’m not able to think or speak a sentence correctly. Its not how i say, its what i say in the sentence which is the problem. Words dont come out correctly. Does this go away with time or any meds help with this ?"

I also have Seroquel as a prn and sleep aid. The things with antipsychotics is they tend to numb my emotions. Which for me is a good thing, because they were flying off the charts before I was medicated. But for many it can be a frustrating experience."

176019547,What symptoms did it help?
176019548,If your diagnosis is sz and not psychosis you need to stay on meds for life. If you only have psychosis and only had 1 psychosis then you can ask your psychiatrist about lowering dose and quit eventually. Many ppl here want to quit and don’t realize that they need meds for life.
176019549,I have severe negative symptoms and stay in bed all day everyday. Maybe its different for you.
176019550,No. You’re not less important bc of MD. Of course not.

176019552,"I got kicked out because I started hiding my money so my mom couldn’t steal it. Once I wasn’t financially viable for her, she gave me the boot. She had stolen about $8,000 from me by that point. She still denies having done it. When I was 17, she set up a bank account for me. I did not know she was an authorized user, so I had no idea why my paychecks kept looking like they weren’t deposited. She would go to the bank and withdraw the money behind my back, and I was so sick at the time it took me 6 months to figure out what was happening. When I switched to cashing my paychecks instead of depositing them, and hid the money, she freaked out and told me to leave. I packed up my car with whatever I could carry, and was out the door within a few hours."

176019556,Ok so this is the best time to argue some voices some discussion with the entire forum. So the rules are simple you will argue your case and if you don’t succeed in wining you will have to drop out or leave it out for some other time. I’ll start the argument and mine goes like this: What is the reason behind my voices always calling me names don’t they know that I am just a regular boy.
176019557,What does SGA stand for?
176019558,"42! Sorry I couldn’t resist. The purpose of your life is a matter of choice. Let me offer you a suggestion. Imagine the future of humankind. There are many possible futures, some of them catastrophic or dystopian, others much more beautiful and desirable. As _NAME_ said, it is well within our power to destroy our civilization and poison our planet, or to overcome our differences and make our lives abundant and meaningful. Your actions matter. The ideas and memes you spread keep circulating. So does an influence of even a simple smile. So make sure the influence you have is as good and as widespread as possible. This perspective demands humility, as sometimes one can feel like a drop in the ocean. Accept that you don’t have to be in the center of it, like _NAME_ character in Armaggedon. There is much to be done outside of the spotlight. Make this purpose yours and you will have a meaning of life that is larger than you."

I tried various things nothing beats than running away from everything, latter is what i am motivated and enjoy to do and fantasize doing the same. How do i move on with normal life?

It was scary. Fear of Hell, being eternally tormented by Just God for deliberately sinning… My mentality has own religion which I named moraunism (monotheistic radical universalism), which considers Quran and Bible as greatest handiworks of Satan, so it is very heretic, not Catholic, not Islamic, not Torahic - it is against them. I coined new term for mentality: psychicity , it is a synonym. The numerical miracles of Quran are something which attracts my attention very much. I may think that I am chosen by Allah to convert entire humanity to Quran-alone Isl
am. Coincidences appear to be interestingly similar in nature to my coincidences. I had some coincidences associated with numerical miracles of Quran. For a Christian, numerical miracles of Quran appear to be proof of great craftiness of Satan! The numbers of letters in verses of first surah (Al-_USER_ID_) are: 19, 17, 12, 11, 19, 18, 43. Five of these seven numbers are primes: 19, 17, 11, 19, 43. Two numbers are not primes, but numbers of letters in neighbouring verses added to those composite numbers form primes: 17+12 = 29, 12 + 11 = 23, 19+18 = 37, 18+43 = 61. Primes from first set (19, 17, 11, 19, 43) have product of digits: 1x9x1x7x1x1x1x9x4x3 = 6804. It is product of digits: 3x 2x1x7x3x6x9 . In the product there are digits forming both 21.7 and 3, 6, 9 together! Primes from second set (29, 23, 37, 61) are formed by 6 sorts of digits: 2, 9, 3, 7, 6, 1. From these six digits phrases 21 7 and 3, 6, 9 can be formed at the same time! Product of digits forming these four primes is 6x 2x1x7x3x6x9 = 13608. Aga
in in the product there are digits forming 21 7 and 3, 6, 9. Sum of both products mentioned above is 9 x2x1x7x3x6x9 and their product is 18 x((2x1x7)^2)x((3x6x9)^2). 18 is 3+6+9. 3, 6, 9 are members of “Tesla’s arithmetic sequence”. Another coincidence with the numerical dependencies associated with Quran is about Thabit numbers (also known as 321 numbers) associated with certain slide. On that slide there was date: 2nd Nov, 2017, which is 2.11 .2017. There were some bolded additive primes on that page: 23 , 11 , 797, 10037, 337, _PHONE_NO_, 11171. On that page there were 5 facts. Numbers: 2, 11, 23, (2017) are associated with dates of my third full going to day hospital. It started 27.4.2017 and ended 24.7.2017 . Both dates have the same digits in them and the same sum of numbers and digits in them. The digit that repeats oneself in them is 2 . Sum of digits other than 2 is 19, which is considered special number for the Quran. What is interesting? Sum of digits in both dates is 23 : 2+7+4+2+0+1+7 = 2+4
+7+2+0+1+7 = 23 . 23 is an additive prime number which is a Thabit number which has a 321 number as sum of digits ( 5 ). What about sum of numbers? 27+4+2017 = 24+7+2017 = 2048 . Number 2048 is 2 to 11th power ( 2^11 )! 2 and 11 are additive prime numbers which are 321 numbers with Thabit numbers as their sum of digits!"

176019679,"I’m currently taking Risperidone in addition to the Invega shot. The Risperidone appears to be causing insomnia. Or, it could be withdrawal symptoms from the Invega pill. When is the best time to take the Risperidone to avoid insomnia, morning or night?"
174346712,"Hmmm. I’m not 100% sure but having been initially diagnosed with psychosis, my psychiatrist at the time said that I would have to take meds for about a year and if I had no other episodes of psychosis then I’d be off meds and considered to have just had an episode of psychosis. He also mentioned if psychosis continued during the time I was taking meds then I might be diagnosed with schizophrenia. I had a hospital visit within six months of my first psychotic episode. So it may just be a brief diagnosis. I was diagnosed with acute psychosis and then I was diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoia. The characteristics of psychosis are found in schizophrenia from my understanding, schizophrenia can have reoccurring psychosis if left untreated. Again I’m not 100% sure but that is more or less what I was told by a psychiatrist and my personal experience with having acute psychosis as a diagnosis. I hope that helps explain a bit. I think it would be best if you consulted a mental health professional su
ch as a psychiatrist to gain better understanding of what you might be experiencing and ways to treat it properly. Best of luck to you, Musicdance."

You know exactly what pot does to you and in my own experience from smoking it and seeing countless other people end up like you, the bottom line is nothing is going to change. Anytime you smoke now you will have a bad reaction to it. It will never be fun again and it will never get better. I don’t know if you smoked it before you got schizophrenia but in my own case, I was a daily smoker in high school. 90% of the time it was fun. But after my diagnosis and I smoked it was never fun again. I freaked out from smoking weed many times, always hoping I would recapture that fun high like it was before I got ill. But nothing ever changed and I would bet good money that it is the same for you. You have to realize that you don’t need the trouble weed causes; schizophrenia will give you all the trouble you can handle. Weed does not help, it makes things worse. For people who have schizophrenia, 
smoking weed is like trying to put out a fire by throwing gasoline on it. It just triggers the psychotic symptoms."

176019752,"Another phenomenon that suggests that humans have the tendency to caricature-ise things (i.e. represent things, and perhaps think of them, in their most characteristic form) is so called “primitive art.” Both ancient Egyptian and pre-colonial South American artist had the tendency to display the human form made up of caricature-ised body parts: Eyes are most eye like when they are pointy ovals, or at least as eyes as viewed from the front. Chests likewise look most like chests when they are viewed from the front. But feet and noses are most foot and nose-like when they are viewed from the side. So ancient Egyptians and Aztecs had a tendency it is argued to draw their gods with their nose and feet drawn from the side in silhouette, but with chest/torso and eye facing forward embedded within that silhouette. The Egyptian art is called “frontalism” or “composite.” 1024px-Egypte_louvre_223_femme.jpg 1024×795 270 KB Please may I be allowed to add links now? I have been banned from adding li

174346745,"I posted this, which received very little attention. . Ok. this was rather technical. so It’s understandable that no one really cared. so here am I again, with interesting personal account! Zinc removed all my negative symptoms. I’m full of energy. I’m back to inventing and soldering and making stuff. I’m doing stuff all the time. No more procrastination. No more not taking showers. Not any more this kind of stuff. No more sleeping too much or being lazy. ALL GONE. All it took is 30mg of elemental Zinc, ELEMENTAL. Not 30 mg of Zinc sulfate or Zink whatever. You’ve got to find out how much actual zinc there’s in it. Supplements that don’t list >elemental< Zinc are scam. I must admit positive symptoms are the same (relatively unchanged). I’m still angry and sometimes paranoid, but not more than I used to be, and for that I still can take more Zyprexa, which I don’t want at the moment. That hasn’t changes. What has changed is: I have more energy and self control to manage it: more 
energy and resources: more self control. And I have the feeling that with the new energy and self control and resources, I can beat the schizophrenia for good soon. With the energy and resources, maybe I’m able to solve the problems in may head. I was unable to do so because I had no energy (NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS). Zinc has taken care of that. I have moved from a person who literally did nothing throughout the day to a very active person. I started making things with my _PERSON_. I’ve successfully made a device that controls my digital camera and takes pictures periodically. It has a display and buttons and you can set the time. like you can set it to take a picture every 3.5 seconds. and it works. All I need is to make an enclosure for it. I also have converted an old server into a PC for using it with blender to create 3d graphics and animation (Graphic card is on it’s way). I fitted a new power supply in it and I had to actually solder a lot to get it to work and now it works (it didn’t fit anywhere el
se, don’t laugh, I haven’t fixed it in place yet to see if it does well with the graphic card, then I’ll fix it). And before zinc I was literally laying in bed all the time cursing. seriously. TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.! SANY0008|690x418 SANY0009|525x500"

176019769,So I’m overdue for my period and feeling really emotional and tired. Woke up with a headache and later it went away after I took a paracetamal. Then hubby and I discussed and issue that came up. I was upset because I had my own plans for the day. And I vented and snapped at him undeservedly. Until he got upset at me. It took the whole afternoon for him to be ok with me again but I could see how much it stressed him and he doesn’t understand. I on the other hand went downstairs and pushed over a chair and smacked my face over and over as hard as I could and cried and sobbed for a long while. Spoke with my sister about my meltdown and she understands fully as she also had bad PMS in the past and is going through menopause now. Spoke with my mom as well but she didn’t understand. She said she didn’t get PMS bad and her kids distracted her from her own feelings. But my sister had kids too and she got it bad! My mother doesn’t understand me like my sister does. She’s too mentally healthy. She
’s too normal to understand PMS and sza. She thinks my meds influence my PMS but I don’t think so - my sister doesn’t take meds. So any fellow sisters (or informed brothers ) on here who can relate or give opinion? Does sza make PMS worse? Or AP’S? What a day… at least I went to the Flea market and treated myself to a new hippie patchwork bag and a black Indian skirt. And took a long hot shower and wrote in my journal. I feel a bit better just having done those things. Hoping my period will start soon so my hormones can right themselves!

176019773,I’ve wondered before if I in some way “chose” to be psychotic. Not that I chose to go through everything I went through but that it was a thought experiment gone terribly wrong. The reason I say that is because there was at least one time where I decided to act “as if” something was true and then I started to believe it.
176019774,Welcome back! It is good to you back.

176019777,"I would recommend you go to a doctor and get antipsychotic medication. A herbal doctor alone may not be able to address the severity of your illness at this point. Maybe you can try other means when you’re medicated and well, but for now you need emergency help. If you go to a doctor he will prescribe you a medication and all these weird things will fade away slowly until everything is normal again."

176019779,"Most blood pressure cuffs are automatic nowadays, but if you have a manual one this is how it works. Wrap the blood pressure cuff around your upper arm, with the gauge facing teh inner part of the elbow place the stethescope halfway under the cuff along the main artery in the arm. You can find it by going to the inner part of the elbow, then listening for it witht eh stethescope. -_USER_ID_ the pump into the inflate position (clockwise) Pump the cuff up until the pressure on the gauge reads around 180 (maybe higher maybe lower depending. My doctor knows me well enough to only inflate mine to 130) slightly _USER_ID_ the pump adjuster so the air slowly deflates, and listen for a heartbeat When you hear the blood pumping loudly, mark the position of the gauge. This is your upper number When you stop hearing the loud heartbeat, mark the position on the gauge. This is your lower number. So for example, if you start hearing the beat at 125, and stop hearing it at 73, the person has a BP of 125/73"

I have no thoughts on some of it, its scary… I wish id knew I am not so far from stabilization…we’ve made the tour of the meds, the docs doesn’t know how to help, they think I can get better with time and efforts but they don’t give a guarantee.

his too… I wish id knew if efforts will help in the future, no? … anyway, I am saying too much now probably… But is it me who stops myself for being well or I really have cognitive issues?

174346746,"Smoking kills on average, but for the lucky few smoking can actually aid in a long life. Of course they don’t put that on the packets because it would be irresponsible, a bit like encouraging gambling 80% of schizophrenics smoke, thus paying substantially for the benefits they receive, whilst on the other hand gaining a medicine that helps with regulating glutamate, dopamine and GABA dysfunction, whilst at the same time poisoning the lungs, thus potentially leading to increased mortality. Tobacco is a performance enhancing drug with substantial side affects, that is both highly sought after and highly valued, yet only the poorest smoke in general. How to switch to simple breathing of oxygen and traffic poisoned air has largely been solved by vaping, but for the purist, breathing water is not the same as breathing smoke. My plan for giving up smoking or at least control it is to join one of the many smoking cessation forums, as last time I tried on my own I relapsed substantially. Obviously one wo
uld be better off without medication, because that would imply one is cured. However, whilst one continues to struggle with the symptoms of schizophrenia, it is not clear whether stopping tobacco as a medication is good in the short term, or even in the long term for the lucky few. Coughing every morning is a small price to pay for a life free of symptoms. Offsetting my taxes by giving to charity instead might help bring me out of the etiological class of smokers, but the problem of performance remains Thank you."

176019834,It’s a delusion. Many other schizophrenics have similar beliefs. I’ve had bizarre delusions before and when you’re in the middle of suffering with them they seem so real but if you can step back and recognize even just a little that it’s just a delusion it might be the first step to solving them.

174346758,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Childhood adversities are different in Schizophrenic Spectrum Disorders, Bipolar Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, BMC psychiatry , 2018 19 12 Research has shown that a history of childhood adversities is common in patients with psychiatric disorders but few studies have investigated links between specific types of adversity and specific psychiatric disorders.We investigated the frequency of early childhood adversities in a sample consisting of 91 patients with diagnosis of schizophrenic spectrum disorders (SSD), 74 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 83 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 85 healthy controls and sought to identify adverse early childhood life events that predict the development of major psychiatric disorders. The Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse questionnaire was used to collect data on traumatic experiences occurring before the age of 17?years and comp
rehensive demographic data were also collected. The data were analyzed with chi-squared tests, t-tests, post-hoc and logistic regression.Maternal absence/loss and economic difficulties in the early life were more prevalent in the BD group than other groups. Escape from home, cannabis abuse, psychological abuse, physical abuse and loneliness were more frequent in the SSD group than in other groups. Paternal absence, neglect of core needs, serious familial tension and absence of adult and peer confidants were all less common in the HC group than in the other groups. The regression model confirmed that different types of adversities play a crucial role in the development of the three investigated disorders.Our results support that SSD, BD and MDD are associated to different childhood adversities. This suggests that psychosocial interventions that reduce the incidence of these early life adversities might reduce the incidence of severe and disabling psychiatric disorders."

176019863,"For the past year I’ve been dealing with this and all my life before that. The voice was finally revealed as a man named _NAME_ (codename _NAME_ from heaven) who is from a different universe and has been using quantum radio to intercept my brainwaves since I was a child. He’s been doing this to arrange our togetherness in heaven. I always thought it was maladaptive daydreaming… Anyway about 3 months ago I experienced possession by a fictional character from a supposedly destroyed universe who claimed I was meant for him and so on… My symptoms went away after meds but recently _NAME_ returned and told me he hid to make me think the meds worked. Do I need a priest or a psychiatrist or a physicist? I feel so lost. The voice also told me I’m betrothed to the archangel _NAME_ and he was him… but I can’t help feeling this is _NAME_ trying to secure our relationship. He has an obsession with fantasy and I know one of his is to play doctor so to speak, so that doesn’t help. Am I sick or is

176019865,"The duty pdoc called me He was very perplexed at my recent DIY med changes and the number of diagnoses I now have, and my current state of mind. I reluctantly agreed to stick to 5mg Diazepam every day rather than every two days. FYI for anyone on Benzo withdrawal, apparently not having consistent dosages just leads to worse suffering for no reason. I conceded as he knew a lot more than I did. He did not like the idea of cutting them in half. He said I would need to reduce by 1mg every month and I said that was unacceptable, as I want that ???? out of my body. He told me he did too, but it has to be slow, but I can negotiate with my actual pdoc when he returns next week. He wanted to up Amisulpride to 1,000mg a day, but I refused and said we did that before and it didn’t help me and went back down again. I thought he was going to mention the ‘C’ word, and he asked me what that was and I said Clozapine. He wasn’t going to say that! Told the doctor that I never started the new AD as I did not 
find weight gain acceptable as a common side effect of Mitrazapine. One thing he quizzed me on is the support I get for my Autism. I told him it was dismal, and the links I was sent the organisations were too busy to help me. He’s sending me an updated sheet The last thing he said was that I need to inform the DVLA (Driving license Bureau in UK), as if medication affects my driving then I need to speak with them. I flipped out and started having a bit of a go, and he said he will leave it to my judgement (Phew) He asked if I was safe, as he was concerned about what I’d said to the duty nurse, and I told him as long as I keep away from alcohol things should be alright. Unfortunately he said he’d let my team know when they return, but I was angry and told him they could both get ??????. Not my best moment.

176019897,"Saving a body The essence of each one (our soul and what makes us living beings) is something that belongs and is created by God, whom promises salvation and benefits for good acts. We will never get to complete any endeavor in decoding or creating something analogous to our soul. However, saving the brain in a non decaying body is interesting and a productive subject, which takes us to a fertile area for concrete and non-schizoid thoughts. Initial step Identify each signal that enters and exits the brain. Basically everything that comes in and out and is easily indentified by some specialized technology we might or might not have at the moment (I have NO idea how far we are advanced in this area). Decode the signal so that it is reproducible. Place of origin, how it was originated, destination and way of acting in the destination place (remembering that we are going to have to create artificial bodies too) how: you have to know how to decode a nervous signal. Depart from there. all tests must be n
on-invasive (we have to develop the technology, this is for those that like science and are willing to take part on a very hard biotech, long term and high reward project) all tests must be generalist, and sub-species that we might find (cause of our origin) must be drawn from studies of the brain’s logical code. Only resort to invasive stuff when the project is VERY evolved and pain is no longer a real problem given studies on how pain works (how to achieve and study-focused processes on a brain without having to deal with any sort of it) Final part (decades from now)(just to give some scare on you, reader) = remove the brain and weld on the artificial housing.

He said something like, “You don’t know what I do all day.” And he’s right. But my paranoia and ideas of reference kick in and it seems like he’s in the kitchen most of the day until I have a show of weakness or lose my cool and then he stomps into his bedroom in the back. People are animals and animals want territory.

176019934,"I’ve been to the hospital. I didn’t think it was fun. For me, getting into a hospital involved checking with my insurance and then calling a doctor, who paved the way. I always had someone drive me. J."
176019935,You can have heartattacks from hyperthyrodism.
176019936,Listening to _NAME_ song In you reyes.i love it co much I want to slip away to this song
176019937,"Is it bad that i have to rely on my meds to give me energy and purpose? I was off my meds for about 1-2 months and i turned back into my loser, no goals, lazy, loner self. I just feel like i have no energy most days and spend most of my time eating junk. Well im back on my meds and feel my restless self returning. Might start lifting my weights again and walking around the lake more. Ill see if i come out of this depression and start setting goals again. I stopped taking my meds because i dont want to take the full 30mg and rather take half. But i only see my psych every 2-3 months and finally got my meds the way i want. Good luck to everyone here, rooting for you."
176019938,"Hey, _AT_MENTION_ keep your head up. You’re a good person and deserve to be happy. I am sorry you’re feeling this way, but time can heal and things may seem like they’re beyond repair now, but get some treatment and I can almost guarantee you can feel better. We all get low from time to time, and we just need to keep going and ride out the bad times and remember the good times."
176019939,I thought I was the only one who believed that. Good to know I’m not alone. This stuff gets hard to handle. But somehow everything is connected in my life.
176019940,I have not and will not at this point go to school with this disability. I dont always feel well and my ability to learn has been compromised. However there are some people on this forum that do those things. I recommend trying another drug besides invega sustenna. My pdoc took me off of it after being on it for years. She know alot of people dont feel well on it.
176019941,"Been a nice day here, tho _USER_ID_ now. Ive had the patio doors open. Actually heard the birds, and not the damn seagulls."
174346780,That’s great that most recover hoping it for myself. You sound like you’ve made recovery. Have you ever had any negative symptoms?
176019942,Things will just continue to go downhill. I’d get back on some meds.
176019943,I’m so sorry for your loss _NAME_. May God bless her soul.
176019944,"Hi _AT_MENTION_, how have you been? Dont question for a moment how supportive you are. You’re incredibly valued here."
176019945,"Hmm?. Why Thank You _AT_MENTION_!. Take It Easy And Have A Great Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening, And Or Night!."
176019946,Well I guess I’m hard as a rock. No pun intended.
176019947,"My breathing has been shallow since I got sick 10 days ago, I can’t breath deeply. I can’t even vape, its making me cough intensely. I am bored without my vape, I am napping during the day now instead of vaping. Maybe I need to lower the nicotine in my vaping juice."
176019948,"I started at 84kg! So although I was pleased with my initial loss it stopped. I was aiming for 72kg, but I am thwarted at 77kg! I suppose there is always the Newcastle diet of 800calories a day, lol I don’t think I can manage that and you need doctor monitoring."
176019949,"No I don’t, I’m not having this issue. You’re projecting your problems onto me. Time to talk to your doctor about meds. You’re not sounding good man. I’m worried."
176019950,"The thing about psychology and mental health is that often we do not know ourselves completely and an objective, compent observer can advise us. This is true of everyone, I believe. But it is even worse for people with sz, because when we are psychotic we do not think we are ill in any way. Also, an objective other person must weigh the ups and downs of medication based on his judgment, not based on what we think would be most immediately desirable from our own point of view. An authority needs to tell us we must take the medication even though it has side effects. That is the current state of affairs."
176019951,thats nice! good that you have some new shirts
176019952,Do you prefer nice voices to no voices?
176019953,_AT_MENTION_ barely on negative on cognitive symptoms…
176019954,"i am taking solian 400mg, vraylar 3mg, olanzapine 10 41/5000 is this too much? can i have some damage"
176019955,"I’m not bashing the forum, in fact I made it plain that I like it. Everything is potentially triggering; this site to me is deeply triggering, but you don’t see me complain. It should also be equally plain that writing something potentially triggering is not synomous with not being respectful of other people’s opinions. The lack of respect came from the other direction, dismissing what he or she didn’t like because he or she didn’t get it and then using an anonymous flag to have their way."
176019956,"I’m on trintellix, and it works pretty well for me. But make sure you talk with your pdoc before changing meds."
176019957,"One time I sold a pair of jeans and the courier said they tried to deliver, but didn’t and then delivered the next day. The buyer was all angry and put out and left me negative feedback, but as it was still delivered in time _PERSON_ cancelled his negative feedback for me."
176019958,I used zoloft and it made me angry and weird they gave me risperidone and it has been working till now and i am on prozac again i think the prozac combined with the risperidone makes me extra sedated and also i will get a prescription of ritalin if its confirmed my cognitives are caused by adhd and not depression hopefully this med will help me.
176019959,"Same for me, a reason why I easily become mad. Maybe its the sz."
176019960,_PERSON_ I know the feeling. I wish our gyms were just down the road. It would help
176019961,I like what _PERSON_ has said in the past. The Internet was one of the initiatives _PERSON_ proposed when he was in the senate. He has also helped people to understand the current climate change. And in the 1990s when I was in America he said that an invisible enemy is a biggest threat as this coronavirus is now. We can not see it and people in all social groups may become infected. _PERSON_ is a very smart man.
176019962,I have an appointment next month. If they can’t do it by phone then I’m not going to it.
176019963,"I’m there with you. I have the TV on all day and on top of that I’ll be on my phone. I’ve been binge watching Star Trek TNG, what about you?"
176019964,Yeah. I’ve been testing it because no matter what I do I feel chilled to the bone. Even while jogging with pants and a sweatshirt I feel cold.
176019965,intrusive thoughts can have to do with SZ
176019966,Get better soon _AT_MENTION_ !
176019967,Never chase the dick.
176019968,"In a way no, and in a way yes. They don’t really help me think of stuff to say, but I have ptsd so I was constantly hypervigilant and wary if people. So because of that I didn’t want anything to do with strangers. The ADs helped the PTSD symptoms, which in turn made me not as on edge when out in public and when meeting new people. I still usually dont have a lot to say, and I’m up front about that. I just tell people I’m a lot better listener than I am a talker. _USER_ID_: The ADs helped with the anxiety, so my ability to have thoughts come more easily has improved."
174346792,"Thank you for sharing Daze. Hah, I think sometimes talking about these type of things takes us back for a little moment. Hopefully, we’re able to see it as a positive. After all, you’re still the same Sheri. Maybe a few leaves have fallen, even some branches, yet the tree has grown strong, resilient, even protective, it still offers shade on those days when it is too hot, shelter when it rains. Some inexplicable comfort of just knowing it is there. Just don’t drop your branches on people’s heads."
176019969,"I’ve suffered from listlessness a great deal. My mind just going around in circles, self defeating itself uncontrollably. So much negativity. I’m sorry it ever happened."
176019970,"yeah thats whats so confusing about dx, distinguishing between negatives and depression, or mania and maybe hyper exciteability from psychosis. Theres very much a blend of symptoms with bipolar and sza and sz"
176019971,"Generally, one intuitively understands that killing other humans is bad."
176019972,"That is the primary reason I am here, call me selfish if you like…"
176019973,"I am so tired of sitting around feeling gross, but I can’t get myself to shower. I just can’t do it, and it’s not for a lack of drive- which I’ve actually had lately. However, because I’m not showering, it’s inhibiting my ability to do things as I won’t leave the house unclean and sometimes won’t leave my bedroom. So even though I want and am able to do things, I won’t. So I must ask your theories (or maybe someone has a scientific answer): What causes us to avoid showers?"
176019974,Pure mania feels fantastic to me. Mixed affective state is absolutely horrible.
176019975,"Thanks! Idk about amyloban 3399. decaf green tea is supposed to help. Lastly, I think that’s so true! One fitness youtuber said; “keep blood sugar “insulin”” even.” Aside from that, he said something. I read that cold showers help, but they get me too turnt up. So that might worsen a mood state."
176019976,"Not in the morning, you might sleep all day. Drink caffeine in the morning or switch to another antipsychotic. I was prescribed Seroquel for sleep so yeah its supposed to make you sleep."

176019978,I took it an had muscle spasms. My neck locked to the side while driving. I stopped taking it.
174346789,I had peaks and troughs of cognitive ability way before any overt signs of serious mental illness . Has having a serious mental illness worsened things? I don’t think so. Age is far more likely to be a factor in any decline.
176019979,Most of the population is poor and barely live. They care more about living than killing the world. Also you are insulting our intelligence.
176019980,Thanks everyone!!!
176019981,I can find humor in most situations. It’s like a vital nutrient for me. A day without laughing for me might as well have not happened.

176019991,Listening to music drives me nuts when I am psychotic because the voices sing along to the music and I can’t hear the singer. It’s really annoying. I like Coldplay too _AT_MENTION_.
176019992,"You still have lots of time, some don’t date until 30y.o. I started dating at 21y.o. I only had one gf, the one who left me."

176019994,To get off them I switched to drops and lowered my dosage by 1 drop each week… I feel like a drug addict.
176019995,"Well, the focus in this discussion are schizophrenics where majority of us are collecting SSDI or some sort of disability benefit. A normal working man would have an easier time supporting a woman on disability because men do earn higher incomes than women rather than the other way around."
174346801,Yes I am on the ward. I have court tomorrow about a CTO and they are saying about clozapine and an injection of haliperdidol
176019996,Thank you _AT_MENTION_!
176019997,Tbh I’m pretty jealous of the UK folks who make enough on disability to go on holiday every year. I wish the US prioritized holiday trips the way the UK does.
176019998,My psychiatrist is useless she doesnt listen to me I have refused to see her for nearly a month and a half because she refuses to try any meds. I see my psychologist every week but this week its twice since I feel like this.
176019999,"I used to be on 2mg of risperidone for awhile until they switched me to a depot since i was suppose to be taking 3mg lol. I did alright, im actually ok off meds and can still function well enough. I just end up writing alot of poetry and stories while thinking license plates are sending me messages, among other things."

176020002,That’s funny. Your dog was very special. I think he just liked people.
174346802,"DISCLAIMER: Unpopular Opinion. I know I have been abused during childhood, both physically and mentally, by that specimen called “my father” and I have also been severely bullied in school. After confirming that PTSD can cause psychosis, I concluded that it is the main cause of Schizophrenia. (Go to youtube and search for _PERSON_). I would like to know if any of you have ever been abused as children. Thanks."
176020003,Yeah it was a widely reported thing and I think your right…it was the Civil War. I think they actually had photographs so that dates it somewhat.
176020004,Nice!

176020010,This guy isn’t worth your time or thoughts at all. Just ignore him and move on
176020011,"Once I saw a guy get pulled over at night and I believed it was the 1800s and blacks were being lynched and whites were acting as they do today at the capital so I tried to throw myself under oncoming traffic at night when there weren’t much cars. I know. Stupid. But suicide is complicated. So is schizophrenia. People like to say “whatever” you’re going through… A B C for solutions. But that just isn’t true. There is a point when someone will go to great lengths to end their pain. I’m happy you survived to tell others. Doesn’t it feel so good to talk, text, etc with others? Anyway. Thank you for sharing original poster. “You’re never alone” while absolutely true, doesn’t mean much when you can’t enjoy the company of those who are there struggling. HOpe this helps in any way. Bye."
176020012,Does he smoke? Smoking effects your sense of taste.
176020013,I used to get derealization. It’s horrible. I would feel lost and disconnected from my surroundings.

176020017,"People should be able to talk about their intrusive thoughts without judgement. Calling _PERSON_ dangerous does nothing constructive. _AT_MENTION_, you should talk to your pdoc about these intrusive thoughts, and if you have any urge to act on them whatsoever please go to the hospital. I get suicidal intrusive thoughts, and they scare me, but I dont want to act them out. They are separate from times when I have a passive death wish."

176020022,"You’re being childish, and it’s really frustrating. I don’t believe I have sz either. But I’m an adult, and I take care of myself by taking my meds as prescribed because that’s what an adult does. You’re old enough to start acting like an adult. I understand becoming an adult is a process, and I know for you you’re still very childish, but you’ve got to put effort forward on this. Take your meds and get over yourself"

176020024,"I’m not trying to “explore” or debate religion, but it would help me in my process of accepting my SZ diagnosis to know whether my unusual beliefs are actually delusional. The belief in question was commonplace in ancient spirituality, so its “bizarreness” is very much context dependant. I’m not seeking to have my beliefs validated or even refuted, only to know if they are the product of psychosis or the legitimate brainchild of my spiritual wanderings. Thank you. Please mods don’t shut this down."
176020025,Luckily my friends have stood by my side. Most of them struggle with their mental health too and we all try to support each other.

Anyhow, if I can teach ESL, I can get a TESOL certificate to be better qualified. It’ll give me enough money to pay off a few credit cards and save up for a house. _PERSON_ makes decent money, but I want to make more than just disability. So that’s my plan. What is yours?"
174346800,I know what you mean - I had the exact same issues. Was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 12 years ago and these thoughts and coincidences literally paralyzed me. It might be time to tell someone if you are experiencing these thoughts.
