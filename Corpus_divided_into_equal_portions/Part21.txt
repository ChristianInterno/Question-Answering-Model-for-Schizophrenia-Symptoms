I have my sacred neigh who is retired now and I visit her.

I am trying to get _PERSON_ to be my friend as in email me but he hasn’t replied to my emails. My friends dumped me when I was psychotic and some because I didn’t work and they did and some because I was a Muslim for a year when I thought my father isn’t my real father but my real father is a Muslim so I became Muslim for a year and changed my name. Two friends didn’t like that i
nfact they hated it and ignored all my emails etc I have you guyzzz I have the woman I’m living with.she raised me too etc and I love her so much and she helps me so much.we sometimes go to the movies together or have once at least.we sometimes have breakfast together.

I know it’s not real, that no-one else is there. But it’s more compelling than reality due to the intense emotion attached to it. I differ from you in that there is intense, nightmarish emotion attached to it. The imaginary conversations are based on recent conversations I’ve had, abusive arguments from long ago or a near-future conversation I am dreading (such as a job interview or seeing my GP).

176120511,"The important thing to determine the creation cause of sz condition or the mutational functional cause of its symptoms ,it is the real definition to things called hallucinations, what is it as it as in itself without wrong data ? In the case,if you depend on the current theoretical definitions which be said about the nature of hallucinations like; (the hallucination is a symptom of the schizophrenia symptoms or/ it is mental symptom,or/ the imaginations of the patient,his thoughts,his feelings towards the world of things,his inner talking with oneself,the patient thinks that the people listen his thoughts or reading them ,or it is mental perceptions without external stimuli ,it is the memory events of the person -visual and vocal - …etc) All such a definitions are very simple and do not rise to the level of the hallucination event that they supposed to explain it ! The hart of the question; How the person himself sees,hears,feels,touches,perceives,coexists with and deal with the hallucination mos
t time of wakefulness ? Is the person deal with the hallucination as a merely a symptom of disease or illness like the symptoms of any disease ? OR In actual reality ,He deal with them as a whole living psychological entity (s),as a present person (s) by somehow regardless his identity or where he is These conscious entities have the full ability to sense themselves AND perceive one’s sense of himself,and then peruse every self-idea that carries information that comes to the conscious mind of the human person This makes it informed and have detailed knowledge of everything that the conscious mind of the person perceives specially in the current time (present) and there is no exception ! It is a living tool that can read information of the human conscious mind at any moment of wakefulness,no matter how fast the mind perceives the concept of its information,even if its speed is a fraction of a second ! Simply,this lets it knows what idea are you thinking,what do you see,hear,and what you feel now,and knows ab
out anything you are talking about, what behavior you want to implement in the next moment …etc It can transform the electrochemical signals that carry the cognitive concept implicitly into a phonemic message (transforming voiceless self-thoughts into vocal thoughts that is audible internally In the useful summary ,it repeating the self-thoughts by a new phonemic mechanism -and this is the core of the mutational process It can take a person’s self-idea as a starting point to producing a new delusional idea far from the reality to which one’s self-idea indicated and printed it in the personal memory Record ! IN any way,you must have a new look to the reality of the hallucination !"
174372699,"As I have mentioned on the forums before, _PERSON_ is the only philosopher that mentions a “devil”. _PERSON_ says that we identify with a fabulation (a self representation) and to do this our “I,” our perspective, must be “devilized” (he says “Mephisto-ized”) I think so that it becomes invisible – so we don’t want to look at that which is identifying with the me. This is in his last essay which is alas not translated into English. That was my psychotic experience too. It was above all, really scary and nasty, for reasons that only _PERSON_ sing about (thanks to _PERSON_ for that reference). I find that only Glam rockers refer to the situation that I found pertained. Science is pretty silent. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and perhaps _PERSON_ say that they don’t want to say what is going on. _PERSON_ insinuates that the truth can give people schizophrenia as I have mentioned on these forums before."

176120529,Depends on what hospital I was in. My first two hospital stays were in private clinics. They were awesome - like hotels with pills. Lots of activities and good food. Was hard to leave. The state hospital had less appeal. The therapy wards were nice though as there was activities scheduled and it was open wards. But the locked wards were scary as there were weird ladies there. And it was so mind numbingly boring! No activities at all. But although I was scared I felt like I was in a safe place being looked after.

I’ve been taking 500mg daily. Basically there are two possibilities that I can see. One if to reduce clozapine, so my symptoms do not return, but I do not have back pain.

176120586,It’s not about ‘authority’ it’s about an intelligent appraisal of the situation . https://livingwithschizophreniauk.org/shortage-of-psychiatrists-in-the-uk-gets-worse/ That’s not a situation where they’re going to go overboard diagnosing people based on very flimsy grounds.
176120587,"Most churches fully accept the ‘modern’ interpretation of mental illnesses so I’d very surprised if the Greek orthodox church took the stance you describe. But they might be mistrustful regarding the sincerity and integrity of your vocation. I mean, you founded a new religion not long ago. Have you repudiated it since then? Being a monk also means falling in line with a fairly strict set of theological tenets, which would certainly exclude Hindu influences."

174372713,for me clozapine was last resort and eventually i had to take it cause other meds didn’t seem to work enough. So I was on riperdal consta and they raised that and added clozapine to it and that worked well. I have some side effects of it but not too bad.
176120592,I thought love was an emotion but apparently not. According to the Internet. So maybe its not so bad.

176120596,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ for helping me out on my thread and not getting defensive.
176120597,"There is a way out of it, but it takes effort and commitment. You won’t see immediate results but after 2-3 weeks you should feel better. The way out is to learn to meditate. 20 minutes a day. I was a worrier and would ruminate, spoiling my sleep and life. I am now a committed meditator and do 1 1/2 hours a day and have been for years. You won’t feel it straight away, but the effort is worth it guaranteed. Good luck!"
176120598,Yeah my doctor told me to increase my Risperdal dose but I’ve been hesitant to do so. It’s going to zap my energy. I’ve been trying to ride it out also.

176120600,"The title says it all. I’m having a real hard time not worrying about this. I’ve been getting blood in my stool and now my bowel movements are like little marbles and I strain to pass them. I have scheduled an appointment with a GI to check me out but was wondering if anyone has any solutions. I have been taking isabghol which is a fiber supplement and drinking tons of water and excercise 3 - 4 days a week and that helps a little bit but I’m pretty sure it’s because of the medications I’m taking. I went to my primary care and he prescribed me a cream because he says I have hemorrhoids. It helped a little bit with the blood but the problem came back. It comes and goes. The last few times I went to the bathroom and didn’t have any blood, I didn’t feel any pain either but my bowel movements are like little lumps. I’ve been stable for more than a year and the medication I’ve been taking has been doing it jobs but the side effects are starting to get worse. I get a monthly injection of 
Sustenna Invega 156 mg, take Wellbutrin 50mg for depression and Clonazepam 1mg for my sleep problems. I feel very frustrated because I feel like no one can help me with this. My primary care was telling me to get surgery for my hemorrhoids and I refused because I don’t think I need it. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know or has dealt with something similar."

176120605,Vicious. I was sitting out back with my ex smoking a cigarette and I could see my son walk into the living room and switch the internet boxes. Which means he was having a hard time with the internet. I felt bad for him and as he finished and walked toward the back door I had a “poor baby” look on my face and he ripped open the back door and screamed “MONGOLOID” at me. He and my ex just about died laughing. He said later he did it because I made eye contact with him. I won’t make that mistake again. lol.

176120610,"The maintenance guy was over yesterday to install a new spigot in my kitchen sink. He replaced the old one and when he left he left two rags here. Hell, I’m keeping them! If he asks I’ll give them back but I love having rags and I’ll add them to my rag collection, I save a ton of money on paper towels with rags instead. Today I missed my support group by just 15 minutes. I had all day to get there but at the last minute I got distracted and I didn’t leave enough time to get there. My sister will be furious and “it made me so damned depressed that I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed” (ah, never mind. I’m the only one here who remembers the sixties). But I was depressed so to cheer up I went to Big Lots a grocery convenience store, to buy something to make me happy. I was browsing and I remembered I needed a new dish pan so I found one but it said $9.00 on it. I thought, “Damn, just for a plastic dish pan?” But I was right there so I bought it. While I was browsing 
I ran into some tough looking guy with his wife a few times. He looked like every seedy, scary guy who tries to intimidate me so I glared at him. The guy was huge and mean looking and obviously could have killed me with one punch so it was a stupid thing to do. But I do stupid things. When I went to check out he just happen to be behind me in line. I glared again but the cashier told me the dishpan was actually only three bucks. Now that I think of it, it was probably me causing the trouble but the guy was mad but in a final act of false bravery I gave him a look and left. And the store worked, I was happier when I walked out."

You’ve done this at a time when many who are healthier than you can’t get their own poop in a group and stay employed. You need to give yourself some proper credit for how amazingly well you’re doing. You’re so close to your situation that you see all the things that are wrong, but I’m seeing a hell of a lot you’re doing right from where I’m sitting."

I don’t know if OCD came about after starting medication or not, but speaking from personal experience it’s often common as a diagnosis alongside schizophrenia, but also it’s there because of medication, or worsens with atypical antipsychotics. I know it did for me that’s for sure. I am trying paxil, 2 weeks on for PTSD and OCD. It is too early to say. Ciprolex offered some help with anxiety and OCD for sure, but made me feel blunted. I don’t know much about prozac though."

If you drink on antabuse, you get very sick. Now i’m feeling much more healthy. But right at this moment i really want to drink a bottle of brandy, everything is dull, gray and rainy, but i cant because of the antabuse. In the long run i want to be sober without the aid of antabuse. Besides alcohol, i have small relapses to opium, but that’s a long and complicated story."

She got mental health services to deal with that. But she doesn’t understand being told you’re out of reality or being inpatient at the psych ward. I have trouble talking to her about my issues because I can tell she doesn’t get them even though she’s empathetic. Do I try to explain things to her? How do I get past that barrier?

176120703,Yeah Granted. But ive got to take responsibilty for my actions and own up when i drink excessively. As an alcoholic - i could wrongly use that as an excuse to drink.
174372738,"Depends which one. Abilify/aripiprazole is a partial dopamine antagonist. This generally translates to medical people claiming that it improves and circulates dopamine to the frontal lobe whereas otherwise it wouldn’t reach there. If this is true, then I am right to say: I feel this is also true. My experience is that when I take it. I am more focussed on thought. or have better control over decisions. It does however weaken discipline (this med in particular) because it feels like it makes you susceptible to actions (eg impulsiveness). This above point can be bad to good depending on what you become addicted to and how you deal with it. This is my current take. Generally speaking. The longer term benefits of meds for psychosis is there I feel, and we need to embrace that as something that is hard to recognise during treatment (especially early treatment). The more aggressively the brain breakdown is tackled- the faster the brain is forced to correct or adapt itself (for usually better?)."

ictatorship ways and denies it when questioned. they would just reply (it’s for your own good) but if it was really for my own good, why did this good became our thorn by our sides? i can only say, real love is loving correctly not just any love. when my parents loved me wrongly, i never heard once a true apology from my parents, while parents by on the morally right side should be set by our examples, but i am sorry to tell you this. parents too are humans. humans would always make mistakes. with pride on parents side, they would never apologise the way i want it to be. they handled me like a dictator but denies it which can be saddening. just sharing my piece of mind. _NAME_ a.k.a lordarous"

Sales is always deemed high stress but if you find a place where you are 100% commission and you don’t have a quota then you can truly make your own schedule. It works for me and I have been able to cover my bills and take some vacations while doing it. I work a lot when I’m doing well and then cut my hours back when I feel like I need to. The sales generated by the times of more hours then carry me through the lesser hours periods. If you want physical work then working for yourself in a trade might be good also.

174372752,"5 Warnings and Precautions 5.7 Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors Newly added subsection: Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking REXULTI. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REXULTI. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the med

176120768,"This was being discussed on the evening news tonight. The Society for Breast Imaging (SBI) is recommending that women schedule their annual mammogram before they get the COVID-19 vaccine or delay screening until four to six weeks after receiving the vaccine. The recommendation comes after increasing reports of a side effect following receiving the COVID-19 vaccine: swollen, abnormal-appearing lymph nodes in the armpit on the same side as where COVID-19 vaccines were administered. Swollen lymph nodes under the arm, also known as axillary adenopathy, are not an uncommon side effect of receiving a vaccine. They’re temporary and are actually a good sign as far as immunity goes. “In stimulating the immune system, vaccines will sometimes cause the lymph nodes because they are a critical part of that system,” says _NAME_, MD, a breast surgeon at UCLA Health. But they can complicate the reading of a mammogram, say experts. Or worse, raise suspicion of a cancer that isn’t there. EverydayHealth.com M

Mental health pros can have a significant negative or positive effect on whether a person with mental illness is open about things . In my case it was a negative effect . When you’re branded as an ‘awkward and troublesome teenager’ during your 1st stay in hospital that’s a hammer blow to thinking being open is a good thing . It took me years to tentatively be more open . That resulted in asking for more help and support , only to be told I didn’t qualify . The psych notes for that time that I got 7-8 years later were peppered with terms like 'Very dependent narcissist ’ and 'awkward and demanding ’ . It should be obvious to any competent mental health pro that if you adopt that stance to towards a patient /service user you’re making a pig’s ear of doing your job . It’s not an environment that encourages a person to be open about how th
ey’re doing . Prior to moving to Wiltshire I had much more help,support and understanding from forums such as this than any mental health pro .

If you are a non-intersubjective “primordial monster”, and also can understand yourself intersubjectively, could that not be said to be in two minds, in the non figurative sense? Or is the monster really you while the intersubjective understanding only an understanding or representation of you? And, when you say you are “alone in the universe” I presume you are not denying our existence, but mean that there is only one monster like you. However, the representation that you chose is one by a famous surrealist painter and there are others that may be representing the same sort of thing (such as images by _PERSON_, and _PERSON_, and _NAME_ poses), so I suggest your monster is archetypal, and also a representation, or understanding, of (one side of) who you are.

At first it was very mild for example can hold 4 or 5 different information or thoughts then it reduced like 2 or 3 and so on. Due to this gradual reduction in ability to hold multiple thoughts in mind awareness of surroundings, time etc diminished which might be the reason for getting symptoms similar to that of negative symptoms. OCD tendencies started as i get doubts due to the inattention and get urge to redo etc. I was very anxious in my younger years but due to this reduction in thoughts anxiety reduced and even if it come it go quickly as when i think of some other previous thought vanish from mind.

176120880,"Being a nursing student I know how dangerous being overweight is health wise. It stresses me out immensely being this big and stresses me out more that the weight gain shows no signs of stopping. I don’t know how big I’m going to be if I keep going on this route. So it’s not just for vanity’s sake though that does also play a big role. I feel exhausted about this. I am terrible at controlling my diet my schedule is all over the place and doesnt always allow for cooking or eating healthy meals my mom cooks at home. Too often I’m stuck eating out. I often succumb to temptation of unhealthy snacks when they’re in the house. I have no control over them being there-my family buys them not me. It will be much different when I have a stable job with regular hours and have my own place with my boyfriend. I will be able to eat at scheduled regular hours and thus be able to cook and plan my meals, and will have no unhealthy junk food around to tempt me. Unfortunately I’m probably 6-8 months awa

174372788,"For those of you who still think that I’m bipolar-schizophrenic, I offer up the following: Every single thing that has happened to, or been done by, anybody to anybody, has to have been. Every tiny little subatomic particle etc:, has had to have been in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, to get US to this point in time. With that in mind, it appears that for some reason I had to be misdiagnosed as bipolar-schizophrenic. In retrospect I was able to analyze exactly how it was done, and trust me, it was brilliant. At the beginning of July I was mugged. Right across the road from the police station, as it happens. When the police arrived (six to eight of them), they asked what had happened, and for my name. At no point did they ask: “Were you harmed at all?” “Did anybody touch you?” “How many were there?” “What did they look like?” “Did you see which way they went?” NADA. Yada-yada-yada…I ended up in hospital, Saturday night too, so…”You’ll have to wait 'ti
l Monday to see a doctor I’m afraid.”. Come Monday I saw the doctor: Doc: “Have you been taking your med’s?” Me: “I’ve never taken my med’s” Doc: “But I have blood tests that show that you were once.” Me: (explained how it was done) I notice a look of “Been off med’s for over a decade and this is the first time we’ve seen him?”, come across the doctor’s face. Me: “I’m not bipolar-schizophrenic you know?” Doc: “Well Dr. _PERSON_ thought you are” Me: “I know, and he’s one of the leading authorities in the country.” Doc: “He is actually.” Me: (realizing the doctor had thought that I was being sarcastic) “I know.” (Google) Anyway, we talked for awhile about this and that, then the conversation turned to the treatment of the mentally ill by the legal system. I had only remarked upon the fact that I was glad to see that things were taking a turn for the better…When the doctor said in slightly heated fashion: Doc: “Those people have been given a chance time 
and time again…” Me: (Quickly jumped in with) “I don’t expect everything to be perfect.” Doc: “Good.” The doctor then picked up her folder, stood up, and we left the room. What with that, making a police officer cry, and having several women “going all coy” whenever I made eye-contact with them, it was quite a couple of days I can tell you. To put it into perspective for you, I looked absolutely awful. I had a cold. I’d lost a lot of weight and weighed about 130lbs…And yet…I caught one nurse giving me the “Tiger claw’n’growl”, and had a very pretty woman literally young enough to be my daughter…Blushing and looking down so much whenever I looked at her, that I just looked at the table until she had finished her talk. Long story short…I didn’t get the impression that anybody in there thought that I was bipolar-schizophrenic. This whole thing has been so utterly brilliant, fantastic and wonderful, all along the way, that I just don’t understand what it was all for. That
s all I’ve got left to think about now. I mean, I SCREAM and SCREAM (metaphorically) on the web, and yet… Here I sit…"

174372783,"You are experiencing symptoms of cognitive issues which is the first phase of negative symptoms. To be specific its working memory issue. For me also its the first symptom I noted long back in my school days. Math, logic related ones must struggle while memorizing subjects tend to get easy. The reason is in math, logic subjects we need to think hard and it requires working memory more and due to less available space in working memory quickly distracted and thus puts off easily. Its not ADHD. In classical ADHD you are restless doing one thing then jumping to next etc etc and there is another kind inattentive ADHD or ADD in this you seem to remain on one thing for very long periods and seem to day dream etc. Either way what differentiates between negative and ADHD or ADD is that the symptoms appear much early like less than 5 years or suitable as its a developmental disorder while in negative symptoms it appear gradually and gets worse while in the other its stays almost same."

176120897,"I just remember when I got out of the hospital and moved into a nice group home. I never had to worry about my weight as a kid. I wasn’t skinny but I was kind of slim and a lot of my body weight was muscle. Yep, used to be really proud of my body. I moved into the group home and I wasn’t working but I finally got SSI. It was a godsend. I had been broke for a couple of years and all of a sudden I had $75 a month to spend on whatever I wanted too. The house fed me and the washer and dryer only cost about $3.00 to do all my laundry. So when I started getting my monthly check, the first thing I did was walk to the bank and cash it and then I would stroll downtown on the main drag and I started a routine. There was this mom and pop donut store and I would buy one doughnut. Then I would hit _USER_ID_ _PERSON_ and buy one cookie. Then I would stop at a now defunct chain of ice cream parlors called Swensons. I would get a banana split and eat it upstairs where there was only room for one person. Next I 
would stop at Sees candies and buy one piece of chocolate candy and they gave a free sucker with every purchase. So that was my routine for many months. And it was OK at the house to help ourselves to cereal and flavored yogurt at night. So I would eat a couple bowls of Golden _NAME_’s and a big bowl of strawberry yogurt. But then one day another resident kind of pointed out that I was getting fat. I didn’t even notice! I hadn’t worried about my weight my whole life! Yeah, I was only a little fat. 8 or 9 lbs. overweight. But I couldn’t stand it. I forget what I cut out, I thought the cereal and yogurt was the problem. So I actually cut those out. And with a lot of walking I managed to lose the weight. I stayed slim for years after that I think I didn’t get overweight again until about 1998. Now I battle my weight regularly but it was funny how I got fat without even noticing it."

I get why you would want to stop putting yourself in social situations. I tend to avoid them too because I feel awkward and don’t know what to say or how to interact for long. It is so hard to keep trying when it hasn’t been working out. Do you think you will try again some day?
174372798,The only thing that’s going to work for negative symptoms is therapy and hard work. I don’t want to/don’t feel like doing most the ???? I do. But it has to get done and it’s my responsibility. The best way to get them under control is to take baby steps and build on progress.

Geodon makes me beyond psychotic. I can flip furniture and do ???? that I physically should not be able to do. That and Latuda do it to me, so I’ve been black listed from things in that family of drugs.

I don’t want to be the same as everyone either. I want to be my own self, my own person. So I have to be mindful, thoughtful, and not become immersed. Like I have unfriended toxic friends, I have stopped censoring myself online. Just being genuine while going through constant ups and downs of bipolar and constant disillusionment and hope, then magical thinking that is sometimes nice. I’m pretty rational. But like, if you get too deep into mysticism and anything seems possible it can also overwhelm you. I can’t stop trying to help people and its not really me being nice, or me trying to change opinions or have people like me think the same way. Not at all! It makes me happy when there’s less suffering in the world. I truly believe that the more good things you do the more good things will come. I also think 
that you have to find beauty in the small things, the tiny steps, the little spaces, the brief moments of bliss in life. It is all we have to hold onto. And if you’re suffering or feeling suicidal right now know that you are loved, that you are wanted here right now and there is no reason to be afraid because you will eventually in time be victorious."

It’s hard to comprehend as I honestly think I haven’t got anything mentally wrong with me.

Currently on Invega _PERSON_ and my symptom management and outlook has never been better. I actually went to a sports medicine lab to get a Resting Metabolic Rate test done. Turns out my daily resting calorie burn is ~1450, 400 less than expected for my age weight and height (23, 172 lbs, 5’11). With this information I’m better able to tell how my weight loss will go when I plug in the numbers for my caloric intake (I track everything now), and activity (Biking 1hr 5x a week, lifting weights 3x a week). I estimate the absolute fastest I can lose weight is 1 pound a week , and even this is gonna be very difficult as I’ll be slightly hungry all the time.

174372839,"That I have schizophrenia and hate my life. That it was artificially induced by aliens and/or the Deep State for no reason at all. When I say no reason at all I believe I was randomly targeted because I was vulnerable. Perhaps they can see things before you are born using Chronovisor and time travel technologies to see one’s future. Furthermore, perhaps, they use the Akhasic Records which are records of people’s lives and past lives in the etheric realm. That Freemasons know about this stuff and more. (My grandfather was a Freemason). That I was tortured in this life and every other past live I’ve had measured in the millions. That I live in an artifical reality. That I cannot survive on my own. That I’m afraid I’ll never get better and that I might be homeless some day or die. I can’t stand the current politics and current events. I’m nervous and scared constantly. It triggers me. The most troubling things that bother me are the Democratic accusations against _PERSON_ and him being f
riendly with _PERSON_. The power and rise and might of the Communist Chinese Party. That I joined the real Illuminati in a past life. I was picked by an unknown alien race or entity. That they wanted me to be the founder of the Modern Day Illuminati. That the old Illuminati you hear about or read about on Wikipedia “Lost their Ways” as well as the Celebrities. I was told this. They wanted me to be the next _NAME_ Weishupt. I ended up rejecting it, hating it, and wanting to leave. I turned on them and I was hurt millions of times. I sold my soul for immortality and a little power I think. I believe this in another life. I’m not bragging or being imaginative or engaging in fantasy, but maybe I am. I believe there are two major competiting Illuminatis with different and opposing agendas. I have nothing to do with them now, but I still have horrible dreams. When I’m laying in bed and awake I focus my thoughts and imagination and can remember or see things vividly or barely sometimes. It’s possible some 
of it is fake or unreal. But I sometimes believe or think I had it worse than _NAME_ Illuminati whistleblower who sounds crazy and is a paranoid schizophrenic like myself. It’s something I don’t want to be a part of. Very scary and evil people and I just want to be a normie. Hopefully I’m delusional in this regard. I feel like I can’t escape and it’s for literally eternity and forever. That my brother will end up with catatonic or paranoid schizophrenia because of me or genetic factors. I love him a lot. That I was targeted by the Left and the Right. That I was brainwashed to be Republican and Christian. That I’m being watched… That the government hates me for no reason at all. That I’ll never recover on my own. I don’t know that’s all I can think of now."

I used to be sorta reckless too but I’d say my closest near death experience was probably when I drove my car very psychotic the first time I thought I was the chosen one at all. May 2011.

You should know that it is impossible to communicate with people in your head though, because that will make you ill. Happened to me, I hear it a lot on here too."
174372868,i been on APs for like 10 years now… maybe bit longer even and long term it helped with the positive symptoms. the negatives and cognitive problems became worse though…
176121171,Greasy rubbish that will slowly poison you to death. Give away the coupons and make yourself a better meal at home. Your body will thank you.
176121172,At that dose you wouldn’t die. People who abuse large amounts and then go cold turkey have a possibility of dying so it’s encouraged whenever you take a benzo to ween off of it. Talk to your doctor because with a mental illness you probably would be better off getting off of it in a detox facility.
176121173,"I hope you have fun. But set up a system with your sister ahead of time. If for any reason the date isn’t going well, and you don’t feel comfortable asking to leave, text her a code word.

176121193,"I was a volunteer weather observer for a while. I mainly collected rain/ice/snow data in my rain gauge for an online network. I had to quit when I moved from my Mother’s house. I also commented on the weather, and am a storm spotter although I haven’t attended classes since the 1990’s (transportation issues). I did report softball sized hail and put some in the freezer when a tornado nearly knocked the roof off my Mom’s house once and my report and hail samples were used in the insurance claim report. Otherwise I just mainly made minor hail reports and a few snow reports. It helped make up for my failure to get a Meteorology degree."

174372882,"I drink quite a lot for someone with schizophrenia. Not every day but twice a week I’ll have several beers or several vodkas. It doesn’t effect my psychotic symptoms when its in moderation. When I have periods where my anxiety is flaring up or I feel borderline psychotic I keep it to a minimum as it definitely makes me more anxious and doesn’t help me think straight. One thing I will say is that the more you drink, the more booze you need to actually get drunk. And this can be problematic. When I barely drink - just a few is all I need. But when I have binge periods I end up enjoying it a lot less because I get frustrated that I’m not actually drunk. Oh and when I drink copious amounts AND don’t sleep - I definitely do get psychotic symptoms (audio hallucinations). But its not something that happens normally. Usually it has to be quite a lot of booze and a lot of missed sleep."

174372893,"""Schizophrenia is associated with structural and functional changes in the cortex, as well as in the connections between different cortical regions. Recent advances in neuroimaging technology have enabled an unprecedented window into the nature, sources, and developmental course of these changes. Structural deficits, such as reduced gray matter volume and disrupted white matter integrity, have been observed, and these changes may be progressive during the pre-onset phase of the disorder, as well as in the early post-onset period. Correspondingly, functional imaging techniques show abnormal neural activity when patients are engaged in various cognitive tasks, including those assessing short-term memory, long-term memory, decision making, and emotion processing, and these changes have also been observed across phases of the disorder."""

176121402,"Because, as most people said, you can’t predict the future. Newer, more effective medication could come out in two years, or one year or two months, you just don’t know. In 1980, I became psychotic at age 19. I spent the next year suffering in total psychosis. After that, I spent the next 8 months locked up in a mental hospital with incredibly bad psychosis. There were very scary people in there but I was more scared of what my own mind was doing to me. And I spent the majority of the 80’s in hospitals and group homes. Cut to today. Today , was my day off from work. I slept in until 10:00 am in my nice apartment. I had a leisurely breakfast, took a shower, and planned my day. I I made some phone calls to my dentist, my insurance company, my GP, and a couple others. Then I drove to my physical therapist across town and afterwards stopped for a Coke. Came home rested and then went to the pharmacy to pick up my meds, in a little bit I’m off to the electronic store. In other words, just my typi
cal day. I manage to put in a little fun some days. So this as much as I have improved from my hospital days. I considered suicide many times when I was 19-21. But now I’m looking back on being employed since 1983. I’ve attended college, had cars, traveled, had luck with the opposite sex, had my little adventures, have had thousands of dollars for me to spend at one point, had friends, met cool people and hung around them. Been to a million restaurants, a lot of movies, etc. This was because I hung in there through the bad times. Most things are not easy for me. But once I got past the severe symptoms and horrible suffering, I built a life for myself. I could never have predicted how many good things have happened to me. In In my youth, I was nothing special, I was just some guy who was thrown in the mental health with hundreds of other folk, I showed no early promise of any other thing besides rotating in and out of hospitals for the test of my life. Do you see my point? You have a fighting chance to get 
past your symptoms and turn out alright. My life is a miracle, and you have a chance too. Many people recover. It always looks hopeless in the beginning. I’m not unique, many people do great things despite the illness. I hope you get something from all this.

176121436,"Hey there, sorry you lost friends and family. I understand how it feels to lose people because of MI and feel lonely. It is possible to rebuild relationships though…either to reconnect, or, when that is impossible, meet new people. Im a total disaster at making and keeping friends, but i managed to meet a few new people. If i can do it, so can you! Volunteering, hobbies and church imho are real good ways to connect. Good luck…"

176121440,Yeah hearing that. It’s tough. People can still present as pretty normal and that makes it hard. Then there’s a health system that is struggling because it all costs money and if you don’t have it the quality of care to you can be pretty poor. I know it’s hard but getting well now is the priority. Sort that out first then move from there. My depressive break at 23 I was still pretty paranoid. I wonder if ap’s could have helped me then but that is life. I don’t really dwell on what was or could be. Stay present and what you can do now.

176121443,"I have no advice for your specific situation, but sometimes the risk is needed to be taken, and you need to fall a bit outside of your comfort zone to try and progress and do something more aligned to what you want.

176121454,"I like what _AT_MENTION_ says. If someone isn’t happy with where they are in recovery, they they should try to find things they can do successfully and do those things so they can start to feel better about themselves again. Then after a while, they can try new, possibly harder things and even succeed at those. This can really build self esteem."

174372931,"My first episode I was 17, and I was in trouble with the law and was involved in drugs. I ended up in a forensic Mental Hospital, and the people in there were proper ?????? up. One of the other patients sexually assaulted me, and they moved me to a community hospital. I don’t remember much of it apart from being forcibly medicated with the police and nurses I took AP’s for about 2 years until I was 19, and I got clean from the drugs. When I went to University in 2010, I was doing well, but the psychosis came back in my second year mildly, and then by year 3 it was out of control at times. I still managed to graduate, but within weeks of collecting my certificate on that stage I was hospitalised once again I came to after a few weeks, and they told me I had Schizophrenia. When they discharged me to community services, I told them all to leave me alone. I had no support for two years, and my medications made me very overweight That’s when I joined this forum to find out more in 2015. Safe to sa
y when I found out it was med side effects that made me fat and tired all the time, I flipped and quit the meds cold turkey. Repeat that last paragraph about 8-9 times between 2015-2018 with the multiple coercive hospital stays Then I found Amisulpride, and apart from prolactin, this drug agrees with me, and I have been psychosis free 95% of the time to put a number to it. Now I am trying to reduce this medication to a non-acute dose, and I gave the doctor little choice in the decision. I am now medium risk of self harm, neglect and vulnerable according to the letter I just got from clinic a few weeks ago :-/ Anyway. Now in 2020, we identified that I have an anxiety disorder, which is being treated with Benzos and Pregabalin. I have a diagnosis of ASD 1 since May 2020 and basically medically things have not been this settled for a very long time Sorry for the long post, but it has taken years of fighting back, and trying to get better treatment I feel I have recovered from psychosis, but I am also aware of th
e risk of coming down on my med Amisulpride. I do not want this to take months, but rather weeks. I want to be on the lowest possible dose, and not just left on an acute dosage. Spoke to the chief pharmacist in my county yesterday, and she did also share my concerns of raised prolactin, and the long term exposure resulting in more risk of osteoporosis I will be having to take 5mg of Abilify for this now, so I will try that To anyone at the start of their journey with this ????, keep an eye on this thread, as you might be able to save yourself from some of the painful process to recovery"
176121479,good to hear you doing better now with the med change. I never been on those meds so can’t really help with it but it’s good to hear they improved things for you =)
176121480,No idea…Hope they had some good manners regardless!

I meet my first client next week! They also said they will give me a second client if things go well 3 weeks later. The supervisor thinks I’ll do fine. I’m really excited! It’s good knowing I’ll be part of something once my day treatment ends. And next week when I have Women’s Group, I can brag about being employed!

176121513,I’d say happiness comes in flashes. There is nobody that is going to be happy all the time. A person should strive for contentment. I’m mostly content or happy. I rarely get sad or angry. If I get sad I feel it then let it pass. With anger I just generally dismiss it outright. The full spectrum of emotions are part of being human. I would say if you don’t experience emotion you’re close to being a stoic. That’s something people have been trying to be for ages.

You also know how much _USER_ID_ they will face because of who they are. I think it can be good for parents to have the time to process those self-centered but normal reactions before they refocus on being loving and supportive."

Your just as valuable as everyone else and that is important. Don’t let ignorant opinions rule your life. Way too many negative people out there who’ll bring you down. It’s not your fault. Please consider being more kind to your person. Revel in the things you can do rather than those things you can’t. Be strong because you can do this and survive. Be powerful because 99% of people can’t deal with the shite you deal with. It’s hard. Don’t get me wrong but be kind. To you and others.
176121545,I would ask your doctor. Chances are they didnt prescribe it for no reason. None of us have the authority nor knowledge to give you advice on what medication you should be taking

176121549,Thanks friends. I am home and okay. I had a struggle in recovery. They couldn’t wake me up. They kept coming in and trying to wake me. Finally they got my hubby in and he tried to. They kept giving me shots every hour so they could wake me up. They said this has never happened in their experience. So I was there for three extra hours. It was okay. I’m home and have physical therapy soon.

176121564,I just was wondering what was worse for you.
176121565,"Thanks! I try to help people who are having delusions, but I keep having to remind myself that trying to talk people out of them isn’t always the best idea. I just feel so bad for people who think they are going to be tortured or go to hell because their voices tell them so. I wish I could help more."

176121571,"For 8 whole months. So much so that I wanted the voices to come back it was that quiet. I think it’s my own fault, I brought them back by focusing on them"
176121572,I am so tired of living this passionless life. I’m a robot not a human. I have no sustained interest in anything. My passions in life are gone. I can barely paint or write anymore. How the **** am I supposed to earn money if I don’t paint or write? I don’t enjoy sex with my husband. I have no interest in it ever since taking meds - which is ever since I got married in 2012. I’m ****ing useless!!! And all because of some stupid meds for some stupid illness. Why can’t I manage on my own? The meds deaden me so much. I don’t know how to FEEL things anymore. I’m so tired of living half a life just because of stupid sza. It’s crazy! My husband said we can be our own doctor so I’m going to do just that. F*** the doctors I have meds if I get sick and if I’m ok I don’t want to take them. If I relapse then I will. I just want to see if I can FEEL again. I miss feeling…
176121573,can you say what u really mean?
176121574,Yeah lack of sleep and increasing anxiety are signs of hypomania/mania _AT_MENTION_ Irritability or a shorter fuse is a sure sign of mania. Talk with a doctor about it before you relapse.

It’s hard to predict on an individual level but on a massive scale, it is somewhat predictable. Sort of like chaos. It’s probably mumbo jumbo. I get a lot of thoughts, which turn out to be correct. I think consciousness is a series of feedback loops. _PERSON_ believes in that and talked about it. I think the brain is a holographic construction. There’s a theory on it.

176121602,I get this too. Sometimes when my husband watches the news I blow up in anger about something on there or get paranoid about the future. He gets upset when I blow up and start yelling so now he watches the news on mute lol!
176121603,Never had a problem with my weight throughout being on meds. Most of the time I did not even exercise.
176121604,"Yeah, it’s strange that. When you have everything you need, people develop other problems for themselves. It’s a strange phenomenom, but I think our western culture is the culprit. We idealise everything, like people are supposed to look a certain way, or have certain things in their life to make them sucsessful. You have to have friends, and many likes and be aknowledged etcetera… I didn’t exactly think like that before sz, but I got caught up in it. Sz kind of liberated me from thinking the way the average _NAME_ does. I am much more humble and aware that society is trying to trap us into thinking that we always need to better ourselves in the way of the superficial, like looks and objects, status and what other people think of us. Now I don’t care. I appreciate what really matters like kindness and the inner qualities of people. But every time I turn on the tv and watch what they are broadcasting like reality series and disturbing commercials I learn that we are living in a deceptive a
nd cynical society. Luckily I know there are a lot of good people out there trying to cope just like me, with this material system weighing on them."

I just want to stop feeling unmotivated and push through my condition to maximize my potential. I was against my own use of them for years but it’s time I think."
176121607,"I really derived the satisfaction of someone understanding from reading this thread. until I started ‘twisting arms’ by telling authorities on them my treatment team didn’t show sympathy at all. I felt so hated I kept asking my pdoc if he wants me to switch to treatment from somewhere else. now I have a nice sympathetic gentle and understanding pdoc. I cannot tell you what a difference that makes to me. let them (the ‘normies’) laugh at our needs, I can just imagine what their needs are… even the religious organizations were often quite the opposite of kind to me once I sunk into sz. it just didn’t feel right or just and I rarely felt welcome in those kind of places. now that my symptoms subsided for many years they are willing to say a warm hello and goodbye. I keep asking myself should I bother to be friendly to people who’ve treated me this way when I needed someone? I haven’t come to any conclusion. _NAME_"

I thought tap water and store bought water was polluted so I would gather rain water, boil it and drink it. I thought it was my destiny to kill Satan with an angel and become God I thought Satan and angels could control people around me and speak to me through them. I use to see like writing on a shirt or writing on a building and think it was a personal message to me.

I’ve been on this drug for 1 year and discontinued 15th of September, 2019 because started treatment according to _PERSON_ protocol from pyroluria and undermethylation, the deficiencies of certain vitamins and nutrients which are the real reasons of mental illnesses. First month after Olanzapine discontinuation I had frequent episodes of severe depression which never lasted longer than 2 days and then were followed by 2,3, sometimes even 4 days of wellness. Now those severe episodes don’t come back but I’m still feeling depressed. I wonder if this is a withdrawal symptom or I haven’t completely recovered from undermethylation yet which can take up to 1 year for full effect.

176121657,"No voice is truly benign if you have to negotiate with it. You also shouldn’t be doing anything the voice tells you regardless of whether you think it’s trying to help you or not. I have always had mean voices and nice voices. My medication treats the mean voice but not the nice voice. The nice voice is manageable because it doesn’t demand to be listened to, it doesn’t give me commands and it doesn’t go against me. If I tell it to stop talking, it stops talking. It might peep up once every few hours with a small phrase like “I love you” or “you’re a good person,” and I just ignore it and it passes. Voices, good or bad, are unnatural and can cause harm so you have to be really careful when you’re dealing with them. Try to find meds that can stop them, or at least stop the commands and the insults. Then if you end up with just positive, non-commanding voices, don’t make a habit of talking back and don’t let them run your life."

Its also a lot more calm in smaller cities, so less stressful. Stress is the enemy."

If you feel like you committed an unpardonable sin, it’s best to go to confession (if you are Catholic). But I’m sure this is not an unpardonable sin.

The best thing to do after an argument is just to let time sort it out. Let everybody’s head cool down. Don’t use this as an excuse to drink though.

You might be able to handle them responsibly for awhile but once you take them several times and they save you from an anxiety attack it would be way too easy to start taking them when you don’t really need them or taking them when it’s not really necessary, like when it’s not a crisis. I don’t know if you will get them or not but if you start taking Ativan I would suggest giving the bottle to some responsible person in your household who would have control of them and be in charge of giving them out only when you absolutely need them. It would be helping you."

It used to be that my daughter calling up and screaming at me on the phone would send me into fits and I would have anxiety and stress and if I had enough stress it would lead to the feeling that things weren’t real and I would hear voices. Of course it was multiple things doing this to me. But now I seem to handle stress better. I don’t seem to let things bother me like I used to. I’m more easy going and relaxed. I think it’s the Cymbalta that’s helping me cope, but I’m not sure. Well I guess it’s all of my medicine combined, but the Cymbalta really made a huge difference, upping it to 120 mg."

positive and their attitude was that the whole situation was just a short setback and I would pull out of my funk and be back to working in no time and back n my feet. I’m sure it must have scared them to see me go so low and in such a short period of time but they believed I would get better. And I did. I went through some changes and got my life back. But all the great things I was told on here and the support was a big part of my recovery."

She’s never pushed them or questioned why I need refills so rarely (I don’t take them 3x/day as prescribed), so I don’t think she’d mind, and I’ll bring it up with her at my February appointment. In the meantime, I’m down to taking only 25% of what I had been. I’m pretty pleased with myself. I don’t know if I’ll be able to go lower than that (that’s half a tablet at bedtime) because that quiets my racing thoughts long enough for me to go to sleep, but at least it’s less!

176121810,I had both ovaries removed about seven years ago when I had ovarian cancer. Now I’m removing uterus and cervix. Last surgery was really painful. But I’m high risk of getting cancer there so it’s safer to remove it and I have had abnormal bleeding. I will probably be in hospital a day or two atleast. I will bring my phone and see if I can log in to internet and the forum. If so I will keep you guys updated. Thank you for asking.

I just feel so guilty when she wants to play and I keep telling her “later” and then later comes and I keep putting it off. She deserves to have me engaged and happy. Not distracted and in psychosis.
176121816,"I believe it affects you brain, for example one thing I think it does is…it effects you intelligence. When I was in high school one of my friends, smoked weed a whole lot. I almost could tell without a doubt that he got less intelligent. I saw him trying to figure out an assignment we did in class that day. The assignment was very easy and he still asked the teacher questions…and he didn’t figure it out before he asked the teacher questions. And he used to be more intelligent, because he use to act different before he smoked pot."
176121817,"I think you are looking at your memories in the wrong way. You are saying that you would like to erase good memories of your life in Canada because your current life is not satisfactory. Good memories are supposed to be cherished and remind us of how good life can be. It is something we can look back on when we have gray or bad days to make us feel better. Knowing that there is hope of having days like that again in the present or in the future. When I look back on my own life I appreciate all the positive memories I have. I may not be able to relive them in the same way, but maybe the idea of that memory can come to life again by interacting with someone new. A new friend or aquaintance. If you are happy in the present or keeping yourself occupied your memories will probably quiet down. You never know something good could happen today or tomorrow or the next day, but you got to be positive to attract the positive. I hope things work out for you."

176121852,I was diagnosed in 2014 with late onset Schizophrenia at the age of 49. I am not a drinker and have never taken drugs nor are any of my family members sufferers of mental illness.

176121910,Wow thats very interesting…I tale it seriously…
176121911,I can relate to this one
176121912,To tell the forum server that you are using at least 15 characters. Like a text is 160
176121913,glad for you. have a happy day firemonkey. _NAME_
176121914,Voyager 1 could be a friend.
176121915,Welcome to the forum
176121916,"This is very interesting. I just finished an independent study on Fatal Familial Insomnia. Lots of the symptoms of _PERSON_’s overlap. It’s curious to learn about the ways psychosis can occur. Though FFI is always deadly and both are incredibly painful, I am glad SZ is neither of those things. If you are into neuropathology you should read The Family that Couldn’t Sleep. I just finished it and learned lots about FFI and other related diseases."
176121917,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ .
176121918,"I doubt it (when it comes to diagnosis, she is good with supportive talks)…but lets hope so!"
176121919,"Yeah, I’ve become a pro at working on no sleep. Most of my sick days are really no sleep days, although I almost always blame it on a stomach bug. For some reason telling your job that you lay in bed all night ruminating about everything anybody ever said to you when you should have been sleeping feels inappropriate. I’m doing some breathing exercises to help calm down, but this sucks."
176121920,That sucks. I miss one dose of Geodon and I get psychotic as hell. Our pharmacy is always out of my wife’s Propanalol. I always have to come back tomorrow and get it. You would think they would just order more but no.
176121921,Routine is good. I usually check in after breakfast like now. I’ll come back online in the afternoon when I’m winding down for the day.
176121922,"Thanks for sharing, _AT_MENTION_ !"
176121923,Just stay 12 feet from people.
176121924,"I left due to health reasons, but I also implicated my previous line managers behaviour in a 3 page document listing all the things he done to me that caused me to quit. I was there 6 years, and I needed them to know what had happened and why. If I need a reference, I can get them from other people who work there rather than going through HR"
176121925,I wanted to be food. I never heard that discussed in any MI discussions but I wanted to live and die like a pig.
176121926,Mine? Never 666/999
174373056,I’m also on vraylar. Are you experiencing strong muscle spasms as well? Any improvement in your negative symptoms?
176121927,"I’m going to exercise today. Hopefully it goes well. We are also taking my father in laws leased vehicle in for a paint job before we turn it in. Luckily, they’re not charging much"
176121928,"Yeah. When I am in a good mood, they are too. But I am mostly stressed out by my headache. It’s a grind."
176121929,"Soup is very filling because it’s mostly liquid . Easy to make too, throw in veggies as well . I used to live off 4 large bowls of soup per day in college. it’s good for weight loss as well."
176121930,Oh no. So sorry. I hope you make it through this gently.
176121931,Nice work! She looks like you a bit…is it a self-portrait?
174373052,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , welcome to the forum. It is possible the medication slightly effects how good you are at CS:GO. But I played competitive a couple years before my dx, and that’s one of the hardest/steepest learning curves there is in first person shooters. My advice to you is to stay on your med and keep trying at CS:GO. You will absolutely get better (though it takes a long time, meds or not). You certainly won’t get better at CS:GO just because you stop taking zyprexa. Keep at it! Best of luck in the competitive scene."
176121932,It has to do with being afraid of and proud about making a mistake.
176121933,Ok I will try a keto diet.

176121942,added a trigger warning.
176121943,"Schizophrenics never become better but the MEDs are adjusted to their symptoms, so its below average feelings."
174373055,Yes ive been violent - and done prison time for it. Long ago when i wasnt medicated properly. It was my defence againest threats (real or imagined) that led me to kick off. Plus me going around delusional saying that “i was an angel for children” - led some people to believe that i was some sexual deviant. Trouble is i pissed off alot of people in my old town for reporting people to child services for smoking drugs around kids. It really was a scummy area i lived in. So yeah. But the CMHT and the Police actually know where im coming from now. So ive been left in peace for the past 5 half years.
176121944,"I’m a marihuana addict. I am clean since 1979. It took years for me to finally get clean after I realized I would never be well if I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop on my own. But I used tools, ya know. Best wishes!"
174373065,"How do you remember that you are schizophrenic? I really struggle with acceptance. Obviously not insanely so because I’m on this forum, but I am struggling with believing I am 100% of the time and I believe strongly that not accepting fully is preventing me from recovery and something close to a normal life. So, how do you remember? Any advise appreciated."
176121945,"I think that’s best. Just remember everything we discussed earlier. You’ll be a-okay. Get well soon, dude!"
176121946,"And nicotine has good qualities. It’s been four d to even help protect the brain from Parkinson’s and Alzheimers in aging brains. It sharpens memory and concentration. It’s just addictive, but when used outside of tobacco products it is slightly beneficial."
176121947,I wouldn’t take it that far.
176121948,I suffer from lazy jealousy. The people I’m jealous of have indeed worked their butts off to get where they are.
174373053,I will be taking it with 3-4mg Risperdal.
176121949,I had a great interview at a job that I should’ve gotten but I wrote on their paper that I had SZ. Even though they said it wouldn’t matter you know it did. So I learned never to self disclose. Oh yeah discrimination is illegal but happens all the time. I got a job at another lab and actually she called me years later because I was an expert at what she needed. Don’t worry there’s something better out there for you. My dad made me interview to be a bank teller. So glad that went badly.
176121950,Indeed. So now on I don’t worry too much about my output. I think there’s loads of people in Sz that do that.
176121951,I have been struggling with paranoid schizophrenia and have never met or spoke to anyone else with a similar or same illness before. Hoping I suppose to find anyone at all that might understand.
176121952,Same thing here except I write with my voices
176121953,Ok the desert monsters will get you dont sleep
176121954,My mother is legally blind and she insisted she was always right
176121955,"If you can’t hold a job due to your illness. Just because you have good days doesn’t mean you’re not disabled. If you are unable to function 5 days out of every month due to your disease, you’d need a job that lets you call out sick 5 days a month in order to pull in income. Most jobs won’t let you do that."
176121956,"why not turn it all into junk art and have a garage sale in the spring. another man’s junk is another man’s treasure. you can easily make old T-shirt journal covers, just look up the kit for instructions or do a tutorial on You Tube."
176121957,I read somewhere that schizophrenia isn’t caused by a single gene but a variation of genes that interact. Why it’s so hard to pinpoint which genes are causing the illness.
176121958,"I guess I’ll go to the ER, but I’m not sure what I should do if I get sick. I could message my doctor."
176121959,"Make an inquiry, if its not illegal then I can send you meds you want by post, Meds here are cheap and its not any problem for me,"

176121962,Sorry if you had a more subtle point I would’ve read the post more thoroughly if it came across more in the title.
176121963,"_PERSON_ defence of the simulation hypothesis has been well publicised because he’s such a public figure in the first place, but he hasn’t added anything to it, he’s just rehashing other people’s work . It’s very hard to go deeper into things - as seen in the work of cosmologists and philosophers who take the simulation hypothesis seriously - without “intellectualising” as you put it."
176121964,i still get intrusive thoughts too but i try not to obsess over them and to let them be and try to put my mind to other things so they don’t get too powerful
176121965,"First off, Welcome to the forum, I hope you find what you’re searching for. medication and therapy have helped me become more aware of what I can and can’t choose. They make it less important. They make the psychosis go away. Do you have a Psychiatrist? They’re really good at these kinds of questions"
176121966,I think if you suffer a whole lot even if it isn’t mentally healthy. The more you suffer the tougher you get!
176121967,In the last 3 days. I feel okay but eventually I need to sleep decently again

176121969,I don’t know if it was a hallucination but I could smell death in the bathroom on the ward. I asked the nurses if they could smell it and they couldn’t. It was very pronounced. Also I could smell it in the foyer and again no one else could. The other day I thought I smelt bad and was significantly maloderis and I asked a few people and they didn’t think so. Not sure if it is just me or what. Seems like my senses are heightened at least
176121970,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ , that’s always nice to know."
176121971,It kinda reminded me of the old techno beats I used to listen to when I was a teen back in the ‘90s. I don’t have any suggestions. I liked it.
176121972,So my Pdoc just added Wellbutrin to my medication mix. He said it should help my depression but that it also may help with weight loss! Anyone have experiences relating to weight loss while on this med? What about experiences with it over all?

174373070,A friend of mine obviously felt I wasn’t listening to him because of my mannerisms but the truth is I am often very distracted because of the schizophrenia. It’s not that I meant to be rude. People can talk to me and I have no idea what they said just a few minutes later.
176121981,Good luck! there have been lots of successful students here on this forum. Study hard!
176121982,I’ll ask my best friend. She has fear of abandonment due to BPD and she went through a one year class that helped her tremendously. I’ll get back to you on it.
176121983,"Well I think if you admitted to the things that are not real a bit more freely then your mental health might improve. Like when I admitted my voices were not real, I saw quite a big change in me. Delusions seems to just go away when you admit they are not real. I think sometimes sz can come down to a few underlying beliefs people have due to stress, hallucinations or whatever that they just did not get over."

174373067,One thing I could offer is to assess how thin or unprotected your mind feels in the moment if that makes sense. If it feels thin… I mean in my case I’m not sure I would use _NAME_ then. I used to smoke a lot but i kinda stopped when dealing with myself just because in my case I felt my mind was abused and reducing mental-affecting inputs became my thing.

176122015,I really hope it works out for you! I think the max dose for Zyprexa is 20 mg so you’d still have a little bit of room to go up if necessary. My pdoc thought I’d need a high dose of Zyprexa since I needed 30 mg of Haldol and it wasn’t enough to touch my paranoia. 7.5 mg Zyprexa has been a pleasant surprise for both of us.
176122016,Sorry for asking so many questions I’d dm you but I can’t.

176122018,"I’ve moved around a lot; I don’t like it much. But about three weeks ago I had almost resigned myself to moving. To be honest I don’t know what happened but I stopped thinking about it. One reason I’m keeping here is that I got a call last week from a woman who is kinda in charge of this place. She told me that just recently people had complained about me making noise by pounding on walls and doors. To me, that was my only defense. The funny thing was that I told this lady about the crap those people were doing to me . The lady understood my tone and believed me. Both of us realized that whoever complained had made themselves look totally innocent which was far from the truth. The only other reason I’m staying is because the woman said I was the aggressor. That was cool. I told her a few things they had done, but in my mind being called the aggressor is actually a positive thing to me. Because it means that I’m not passive and finally all the hundreds of times I have stuck up for myself 
paid off because I think as a group, that schizophrenics are passive sometimes. So I feel I win and that even if I can’t punch walls anymore, I will beat these people. And they have done some really, really rotten stuff. Very low, crazy stuff. I lived independently in society for 20 years. I took care of myself with some help. But three years ago, after 20 years I am back in the system and I may be in the system until I die, so being somewhat of an aggressor can only help me. I hope the days of me meekly entering hospitals or trying to be nice when I enter group homes are over. It ain’t fair for me to try to be nice when the other parties are testing or judging me. No one will fault me if I come in a little wary or angry to those places."

This is all real, I swear. I found the transcripts online. I’m worried that Russians are doing things behind my back. This to me all sounds like schizophrenia, but since it happened to me and has even evidence to prove it, I just wonder what’s true. Like I think even I would wonder if I was really schizophrenic if I was a stranger given all the weird things that actually have happened."

176122030,"They are thoughts that you don’t feel like you voluntarily thought of them, sort of out of your control thoughts, as if they come from somewhere else? Because if the thoughts are like that, that would be classified as auditory hallucinations I think…"

176122032,Thank you. It feels real to me though. I believe I’m tied up in invisible restraints and I’m wondering who tied me up and I’m sure my mum was in on it if not responsible. I want to feel free. I can’t get out of the restraints asi don’t now how. I always had this feeling last year or more but since my mum came it’s munch much much worse. Thank you for your kind words. I don’t know what to do about it.

176122040,"One of the ways I was thinking when psychotic was that sz was involved in a dialectical process in between dialectics and dialectical materialism. My thinking was all over the place at the time but now looking back and can reflect on it the thought was something like the things sz represents are antithetical to what society is basically founded on and in particular what health science is based on. My thinking at the time was more of a physics type reasoning and was contributing to my behavior and was the distorted lens i was using to observe the world. Si basically dialectics is an argument between two opposing viewpoints to establish truth and the materialist form is the objective reality of matter gives rise ti certain ideas that cause natural conflicts and social process. So society nurtures the mind to make sense through meaningful sentences ,to be rational, to be organized, to have good hygiene and fashion sense, to be civilized , to have a purposeful set of mental skills, to intetact well wit
h others anyway the list goes on. So my thinking was that this difference resulted in a material conflict because the material reality of sz namely disordered biology give rise to these confluctual ideas. Anyway my perception was closer to physics than dialogue but i still think there is something dialectical about it namely in the way people react to sz almost criminalizing it or opposing it like a kind of anarchistic political viewpoint."

174373081,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Wendan decoction (Traditional Chinese medicine) for schizophrenia. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Cochrane database of systematic reviews , 28 2017 06 Wendan decoction (WDD) is one of the classical Chinese herb formulas used for psychotic symptoms. It is thought to be safe, accessible and inexpensive.To investigate the effects of WDD for treatment of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illness compared with placebo, antipsychotic drugs and other interventions for outcomes of clinical importance.We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (February 2016), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, China biomedical databases group (SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang) and clinical trials registries. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We also inspected references of identified studies and contacted relevant authors for additional i
nformation.Randomised controlled trials with useable data comparing WDD with antipsychotics, placebo or other interventions for people with schizophrenia.We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean differences (MD) between groups and their 95% CIs. We employed a random-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.We included 15 randomised trials (1437 participants) of WDD for schizophrenia. There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear.Data showed WDD improved the short-term global state of participants compared with placebo or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-quality evidence).When WDD was compared with antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine or risperidone, 
no difference in short-term global state of participants was observed (2 RCTs n = 140, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.98 to 1.43, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (total endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): 2 RCTs, n = 140, MD 0.84, 95% CI -4.17 to 5.84, low-quality evidence). However, WDD was associated with fewer people experiencing extrapyramidal effects (EPS) compared with other treatments (2 RCTs 0/70 versus 47/70, n = 140, RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, moderate-quality evidence).WDD is often used as an add-on intervention alongside antipsychotics. When WDD + antipsychotic was compared to antipsychotic alone, the combination group had better global state (short-term results, 6 RCTs, n = 684, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (short-term total endpoint PANSS: 5 RCTs, n = 580, MD -11.64, 95% CI -13.33 to - 9.94, low-quality evidence), fewer people with EPS (2 RCTs n = 308, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70, moderate-quality evidence) and reduction of the me
an use of risperidone (1 RCT n = 107, MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.53, low-quality evidence). But, there was no effect on weight gain (1 RCT n = 108, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24, low-quality evidence).When WDD + low-dose antipsychotic was compared with normal-dose antipsychotic alone, the combination again showed benefits for short-term global state (7 RCTs n = 522, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93, moderate-quality evidence), mental state (total endpoint PANSS: 4 RCTs n = 250, MD -9.53, 95% CI -17.82 to -1.24, low-quality evidence), and fewer participants with EPS (3 RCTS n = 280, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.51, moderate-quality evidence).Across all comparisons, we found no data on outcomes directly reporting quality of life, hospital service use and economics.Limited evidence suggests that WDD may have some positive short-term antipsychotic global effects compared to placebo or no treatment. However when WDD was compared with other antipsychotics there was no effect on global or mental state, but WDD was associa
ted with fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, positive effects were found for global and mental state and the combination caused fewer adverse effects. The available evidence is not high quality. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia."

176122145,honestly i was miserable before the meds.with meds im a little bit better but isolation is my main problem.i reckon thats the issue.but hey at least im sleeping well.

176122167,My mum is a little bit done. I’ve never seen her so shut down as she has been in the past year She has spent 24 years of her life I mean years of solid caring for her children in florid psychosis between all 3 daughters She appears to be calm but will fly off the handle in one way or another if any thing doesn’t go as perfect She is 76 and has had her mind exploded by caring I’m 45 Sister died aged 25 after a deterioration of 12 years pschotic and deteriorating And our youngest sister has spent 7 yrs living with our mum with violent alcoholism and Constant psychosis I had a 7 yr plus journey with yoga Which I’ve stopped until now for quite a few years My mum only saw my negative states Like feeling very drained after 6 am classes Or feeling I had to be perfect with it I did yr 1 intensive first year teacher training I’d do self practice at home and in hospital for a couple of years And I was literally obsessed with my teacher I put dreads in my hair to be like her My mum freaks if I go bac
k to classes Now I’ve started again and I’ve got a good feeling about the Sanity and spiritual focus I think the word yoga would make her head explode Reply Whether or not keeping my world (my passion and action on or off the _NAME_ and spiritual beliefs) to myself My husband now knows and is keeping an eye on me I once asked her whether she wanted me to keep certain things to myself because she panics so much with even any thing even really trivial makes her panic with worry. I mean even one sentence and it will occupy her mind for days My yoga practice is developing but this time wanting to keep it mostly positive and self compassionate I’ve been meditating mostly every day which she knows about I’m doing a course to meditate and be mindful If she can see I might be able to meditate But to her restarting yoga might result in complete meltdown
176122168,"Going to therapy with my current therapist is really a waste of time but most of the therapists around here are worse than her. She’s rich and conservative, probably not the best fit for me. She’s also judge mental and seems spoiled. I’m also used to seeing her, not going to switch therapists now. She gives me advice that I’m familiar with. Many times I dish out advice to her."

176122171,I have been stable on meds for about 8 months with no hallucinations but have been getting faint voices recently. The voices sound like they are coming from outside my head or inside my ear. Interesting what you said about developing the conscience.
174373112,"When I was 19 I visited a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with depression. Sometimes the start of schizophrenia looks like depression. I didn’t take antidepressant meds and just went on with my life. I got worse inch by inch, year by year. It came to a head when I was 38. I was involuntarily hospitalized."

Also you could check if it is possible to work even though you are on disability. I believe it is possible for the goverment to just substract the disability from paid work if you start earning.
174373115,"I have hope but I can’t say that I am optimistic about the price ha, maybe it will be affordable or maybe not. I am scared to switch meds though, I don’t want to experience positive symptoms again if I don’t have to but I bet I am saturated pretty heavily with invega at this point so there probably wouldn’t be a period for symptoms to come on."

176122188,"I was told early on by one of my psychiatrists that schizophrenia tends to improve for men, but gets worse for women both around the age of 40. Of course there are exceptions to this rule but that is the general trend. I’m in my 40’s and I am definitely doing better than when I was in my 20’s."

176122191,"But it’s not what you think. My personal experience is that money can buy happiness. When I have had extra money in the course of a lifetime, I could relax because I didn’t have to worry about paying bills and if I am driving around doing errands than I could pick up a coke or a hamburger without a second thought. I guess the main reason money makes me happy is when I compare my life without money vs my life when I have money, having money always wins. I’ve racked up huge credit card debt many times in my life but somehow something always came up and I paid them off. And now, I paid off all my bills and I have extra money again. This happened recently but for the first time I wasn’t happy, in fact I was depressed for some reason. It felt like an empty victory. That lasted a couple days. But I’m over it now. When I pay my rent I’ll have a nice chunk left over to treat myself to some luxury and do a few things."

I see him on the 31st for our appointment and we spoke on the phone for about 10 minutes last week. We tried to get a few med things sorted from when I was in the hospital. He couldn’t do much though without me physically in his office. He likes to see me physically, but I did explain to him the mess the hospital left me with so he gave me samples of one med to hold med over and put in for the other one. The other med is supposed to be for “hallucinations” it needs a prior authorization though so yeah. I’m just trying to hold it together. I will be telling him what happened I just got really freaked and didn’t know where to turn so I came here."

176122205,"2.3.5 Conclusion My opinion is that _NAME_ is unable to understand and use and weigh information related to financial matters and therefore does not have capacity to manage his own finances. To my mind, having the appointee in place is a preventative strategy for _NAME_’s mental health. It reduces the stresses he might experience should he become subject to unmanageable debt and helps him keep his spending on alcohol within a reasonable limit. _NAME_’s press for this assessment seems to be less about his actual financial situation and is more related, to some extent to a need for control, but also for security. He is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of living with a stranger who demonstrates what he considers to be dangerous and unpleasant behaviours. I would urge colleagues in social care and at _NAME_ to consider how _NAME_ could be given assurances and / or make a contingency plan. At this point I will be discharging _NAME_ from Clinical Psychology"

176122223,_AT_MENTION_ I think you are right to give it a little time. Life has a way of throwing us a hanging curve ball. Doctors are rich I admit but they believe in the Hippocratic oath to become doctors. I’ve never met a money hungry charlatan who didn’t care. Its big pharma we have to worry about though.

We can defeat that for sure. When my pdoc suggested going on Zyprexa, I was scared of gaining my weight back, but I also knew that I badly needed a med change. I decided to just be proactive and start maintaining a healthy caloric range from the start. I am very focused, I plan out all my food for the week on my Sparkpeople nutrition log. I make my grocery list based on what I planned. I have some days that are 1200-1300 calories and others that are 1300-1400, I try to have a mix. Sparkpeople tells me I can have 1200-1550 calories a day, but as long as I’m not working and more active, I make 1400 my max. I don’t get hungry on that. I hope you continue the success! You are also doing awesome!"

Sometimes she makes me do things like making a good memory box or something I think is stupid but I understand she is trying to get me to focus the positive side of things
174373147,"There have been times when I’ve been hallucinating and I was aware that it was a hallucination. Perhaps there were times that I was unaware, I’m not sure how I would know for sure if one got by me. I have frequent hallucinations that have tells, like bugs, but they are a matte black, and that gives it away because real bugs have more color to them. But when you see something move like a bug you startle anyway, it takes a few seconds to realize it’s just your mind playing tricks on you. By then you’re already an ass for jumping for no reason. Same with shadow people, they are matte black, real bad guys have more detail, still scary and makes the heart skip a beat or two. Other, more elaborate visual hallucinations that I’ve had were obvious, like the ceiling ripping open and the heavens glowing through the roof down on me and people stepping out of the curtains or out of the wood grain. As far as auditory hallucinations go, if it’s in my head I can tell. If the sound is outside my head I 
have a harder time and have to get up and go investigate to see if there is a source for the sounds. Except whispering, obviously, because I can easily see there is no one standing there whispering in my ear. But if I hear someone laughing outside, I have to go look. Or if I hear men talking outside my window, i have to peek out the window to know for sure. If I was having an extreme hallucination I accept that I may never know that I wasn’t based in reality. That’s the scary part of having a psychotic disorder, you just never know. I can’t count on myself 100%. Thats hard."

It is a culture war. I heard undertones from my care co-ordinator saying that “I don’t have to get so political, we’re here to help”, that was reassuring, but she didn’t say it out loud. The war is none of my business, but it is because the patients are caught in the middle, and I am particularly sensitive to it owing to my background. I fear the militants and have sympathy with the sufferers (the majority of patients), whom the militants are fighting for. But ultimately I don’t fit into either camp."

176122349,"# A multimodal magnetoencephalography 7 T fMRI and 7 T proton MR spectroscopy study in first episode psychosis We combined magnetoencephalography (_USER_ID_), 7 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 7 T fMRI during performance of a task in a group of 23 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 26 matched healthy controls (HC). We recorded both the auditory evoked response to 40 Hz tone clicks and the resting state in _USER_ID_. Neurometabolite levels were obtained from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The fMRI BOLD response was obtained during the Stroop inhibitory control task. FEP showed a significant increase in resting state low frequency theta activity ( p < 0.05; _PERSON_ d = 0.69), but no significant difference in the 40 Hz auditory evoked response compared to HC. An across-groups whole brain analysis of the fMRI BOLD response identified eight regions that were significantly activated during task performance ( p < 0.01, FDR-corrected); the mean signal extracted from those 
regions was significantly different between the groups ( p = 0.0006; d = 1.19). In the combined FEP and HC group, there was a significant correlation between the BOLD signal during task performance and _USER_ID_ resting state low frequency activity ( p < 0.05). In FEP, we report significant alteration in resting state low frequency _USER_ID_ activity, but no alterations in auditory evoked gamma band response, suggesting that the former is a more robust biomarker of early psychosis. There were no correlations between gamma oscillations and GABA levels in either HC or FEP. Finally, in this study, each of the three imaging modalities differentiated FEP from HC; fMRI with good and _USER_ID_ and MRS with moderate effect size."

174373162,"A partial agonist DOES have some stimulating effects, but also some blocking effects. Partial agonists of anything, not just dopamine, will act as either a blocker or releaser depending on the level of the neurotransmitter while the partial agonist is in the brain. Partial agonists act like “stabilizers” more than direct blockers–if there is too little dopamine, it will raise it, if there is too much dopamine, it will block it. This is advantageous in schizophrenia treatment because it’s not all just too high dopamine. Some parts of the schizophrenic brain have too much dopamine, but others are hypofunctional and have too little. So that’s why I think a “stabilizer” (partial agonist) works so well for tackling all the symptoms."

I’ve been on abilify since I was 14, which was almost 20 years ago now… I’ve seen a few different psychiatrists in this time. I had an excellent cpn before, but when I had my daughter he left and was replaced by a social worker. I’m quite nervous. I think I might write down the main points of my experience in bullet points. I wrote to a therapist a few weeks ago, but it was a whole a4 page. I don’t think a cpn would have time to read it all…? Had some bad experiences with the mental health team, so it will take a while to build up trust."

176122386,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ ! I remember you from the family forum. I think after a certain point natural medicine can’t do much for truly intractable problems that take a long time to heal. I’d strongly recommend an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer for the anger issues. I take Haldol at 2 mg a day, and it takes the edge off the “crazy narrative”, along with taking D.E.N. Every day is a little bit more recovery. Need antipsychotics. Maybe indefinitely. Makes you sleepy though. I’d rather have a 12 hour day in normalcy than a 16 hour day fighting the crazy ???????? narrative."

Was disappointed to discover the Disney resort here is $700 per night. On O’ahu you can probably stay somewhere with an ocean view for $150-200 per night if you keep searching.

C _PERSON_, V _PERSON_, _PERSON_, PP _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Clinical neuropharmacology , Apr 30 2019 Introduction of old and new generations of antipsychotics leads to significant improvements in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms remain refractory to conventional trials of antipsychotic therapy. Recently, there were several open clinical human trials with curcumin. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol, which has a variety of pharmacological activities, including antioxidative and neuroprotective effects. The studies showed that curcumin improved the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of our study was to examine the efficacy of curcumin as an add-on agent to regular antipsychotic medications in patients with chronic schizophrenia.Thirty-eight patients with chro
nic schizophrenia were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The subjects were treated with either 3000 mg/d curcumin or placebo combined with antipsychotics from January 2015 to February 2017. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia.Analysis of variance showed significant positive changes in both groups from baseline to the end of the study in all scales of measurement. There was a significant response to curcumin within 6 months in total PANSS (P = 0.02) and in the negative symptoms subscale (P = 0.04). There were no differences in the positive and general PANSS subscales, and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia scores between the treatment and placebo groups. No patient complained of any adverse effect.The promising results of curcumin as an add-on to antipsychotics in the treatment of negative symptoms may open a new and safe therapeutic option for the management of schizop
hrenia. However, these results should be replicated in further studies.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT_PHONE_NO_."

176122499,"hey sriharryster. I was unemployed for 7 years due to mental illness. Then I started volunteering, because I met this really nice person & wanted to volunteer for her. I volunteered for her for a year. Then I applied for paid work & she was my referee. Now I have 2 paid jobs thanks to her. The people in my 2 new jobs are really nice, I enjoy work people mostly (medication helps a lot with this). My point is, there are nice people out there to work with & work for. If you are unhappy with your current workplace people, you can do better. You deserve better. You just have to be smart about it - make sure you have a good reference from your current employer for your next, new employer. I am proof that things can get better in the workplace. good luck"

176122504,"The camera doesnt do that. The human brain processes information in a strange way which means it will occasionally produce a very dark or disturbing thought at random. This happens to everyone. Most people just shrug and move onto the next thought. A few people get stuck on the disturbing thought. It causes anxiety, which signals to your brain that this is a Very Important Thought. It then produces more of that thought and keeps going on and on. This is called intrusove thoughts. The best way to treat them is to remind yourself to stay calm, nit pay attention to the thought, and wait for a new thought to drift into your head."

I can’t lose, im aging right before my eyes. once my knee is rested im going to try to start doing more cardio, to tone down some. usually I skip it, as it’s too hard and I prefer weight lifting. I just can’t stay motivated, it’s easy to fall back into the old routine. definitely not going to splurge on any more purchases next month. I need to get back to eating healthy, which I haven’t been doing because money is tight. lots of pasta lately, im thinking about trying keto, but hear it’s not healthy long term. im a typical yo-yo dieter, once I start eating 3 meals a day again the weight comes right back. I think working would help keep me active and help keep the weight off. im also going to cut out the coffee which is not helping my metabolism. I will still allow some rice, but I think that is going to be my only grain, no more oatmeal for me. and a fruit smoothie and veggie juice in the morning. with some raisins on my 
salad for carbs. would like to shed about 5 years in appearance, probably not possible, but I will try. I’ve noticed I really look like a man lately and not so young in all the pictures I’ve taken of myself."

176122516,"I don’t have any advice that hasn’t already been given- eat less calories, exercise more- but I wanted you to know you aren’t alone. I have gained 120 lbs. in two years. I tried My Fitness Pal, but I became obsessive, and all I could think about was calories. I kept gaining anyways. I gave up around this past December and started eating what I want. Obviously, that didn’t help. A good portion of the weight I’ve gained came from those few months- I was gaining double the amount of lbs. that I had been before. Now I’m back to My Fitness Pal. I’m eating alot of fruit instead of a lot of Doritos. I ate grapes for breakfast this morning, a quesadilla for lunch, and Mandarin oranges for a snack. I think the quesadilla may have put me over my calories for the day as it had cheese and fried onions on it. It was darned good though. I tried to walk, too, but only got down one street before having to turn around because I developed blisters on my feet from my new shoes. I really am excited to ex
ercise. I bought a little Kanken backpack, a water bottle, true wireless earbuds, and some workout clothes. I only plan on walking at first, but I will do weights once I find where I stuck them. My place is a wreck, so they could be anywhere."

Someone told me their ptsd flashbacks were more intense than just reliving over and over and memories. The way they described it they have like outer body experiences like they relive these memories in a different dimension or something. I couldn’t relate to that so I didn’t think I was getting ptsd flashbacks but maybe I do if it’s the same 3 events over and over.

174373194,"I was in university. I felt stress and my grades were affected so I stopped university. I started hearing voices, a baby cry and my mother calling me. I saw many doctors to talk about my symptoms. My family dr ignored me. I then saw a dr in a clinic, I asked him to refer me to a psychiatrist, he refused and referred me to a psychologist but I never went because they wanted 200$ per session and I didn’t have money; I knew it wouldn’t help. I saw an endocrinologist, I thought I had hyperthyroidism because it can cause schizophrenia-like symptoms. He refused to send me to a psychiatrist. He told me see a psychologist. Frustrated, my psychosis got worse, I thought I was immortal and Jesus, I ended up trying to kill myself with a bottle of Tylenol to end the symptoms. My parents came home and saw me vomitting the pills. They brought me to the emergency where the dr said I was close to loose my liver. I would have needed a liver transplant if my parents came home late. I was then sent to a psychiatri

176122535,"My depressive-psychotic symptoms lead to a lot of illogical paranoia and intense feelings of never being able to fit in anywhere. They also lead to a lack of pleasure in things most people enjoy; heck, in things I used to enjoy. All of these issues combined can cause me to isolate and kind of withdraw into my “own little world”, so to speak. Not saying this is the healthiest way to cope, but it’s the easiest one to turn to when I’ve reached my limit of dealing with normal life effectively. I can come across as aloof, even uncaring to people who don’t know why I act like this. It’s never anything personal, but it’s hard to reassure people of that. I’m trying to do better but it seems to be just as hard to try to improve. It’s frustrating knowing this is how I’m widely perceived; it’s really something that I can’t do much about at this moment though I will reiterate that I am trying.

176122553,"The year after I broke my neck in a car accident, I was seeing a therapist, _PERSON_. She is a very kind and empathetic woman, and I felt a great connection with her. Things went South for me because of insurance companies, and I had to stop seeing her. Last year I asked her for a referral to someone who did something called acceptance therapy. Nice young guy, I was just learning the ropes when an issue arose concerning payment. I was getting close to having a grand mal seizure, so I hadn’t slept in a couple of weeks, and of course when you get run down the symptoms of schizophrenia start having a greater impact. Long story short, I kind of snapped at him. Later I felt bad about it, so I sent him a message apologizing. We had a good chat and all was put to rest. Now I’m in a place where I feel like I’m finally ready to sit down and do the hard work on myself as a person. So I left her a message, but I am not hearing back from her. I am assuming it is because I embarrassed her by snapping at _
NAME_, when she was the one that referred me to him. My question is, should I pursue the matter with her and try to explain my point of view to her, or simply suck it up and take it on the chin. Maybe there’s a lesson hidden in there as to not being an a-hole with people."

Police came cause he got a complaint he was playing too loud music and argue with neighbor. Police had been there before and knew the guy had mental problems.

I got it out recently because it seems to correlate to a lot of things I’m working on in therapy now. What I’ve looked at so far has really resonated with me and I think it can help me. I have _PERSON_’s syndrome, which seems to share a lot in common with Borderline Personality Disorder, like a tendency toward all or nothing, black or white thinking. Also, a lot of social skills do not come as naturally to me as someone who is not on the spectrum. I have PTSD and high anxiety as well. I have not been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but my biology makes me vulnerable to psychosis, which I have experienced a few times. I had a serious psychotic break in 2014, which is what brought me to this website. I hope you find some success with DBT with your new therapist."

We noticed this before I got sick. My wife was the one who pointed it out. We didn’t get cell phones until recently. We always used the house phone. My wife still uses it or I wouldn’t have one. If my wife is awake she is on the phone. I don’t know why they listen to her. I seldomly make phone calls. I have had my house broken into before. It was kids. They stole my son’s Xbox and all his games and my digital camera and some cash I had laying around. They got in through the dog door. The police man showed me how they got in. Probably couldn’t fit through it but you could reach in with your hand and unlock the door. I have had renters insurance or

The last ones I had were thru a temp agency, and the Head Chef was a big bully, he took me aside and gave me a tongue lashing, We don’t discuss hourly pay while on the job, finally had to tell him she asked me what I’m getting paid, and I answered her, plus if you can’t discuss it on the job, then where? whatever. I never went back. My last job, a female co-worker screamed at me, and I walked out, burnt that bridge with a temp agency. The last good job I had, when I was doing very well, the security guard verbally and physically bullied me over my mental illness, it’s the first you find out about me if you Google search me, since I wrote a book on it, anyway, I went to all of them about it, and they did nothing, so I was forced to quit. I’ve heard all the guys want me back. So now, without working, _NAME_, my brother, anybody else doesn’t understand why I don’t have a job. Well, I’m 50 years old, and if I’m not treated

I went outside and some girl yelled my name from down the block. While i was driving with someone they honked their horns randomly and made the person i was driving with say that was weird.

I thought “life is bad, but I have to take care of people like my wife” and later my kids. Something happened about three years ago. No single event, I just began to lose my ability to ignore the world around me. The symptoms got harder than ever before in my life, the voices became much more often and much more intense, and my delusions were being acted upon. All my life it wavered, but never like this and I couldn’t “soldier” my way through it anymore. I’ve deteriorated ever since and the medicine is necessary now.

176122836,"Hi, Here is a list of supplements which is very useful for reducing obsessive compulsive disorder aka OCD tendencies. NAC with cofactors like selenium and molybdenum. I find doctors best brand’s ‘Doctor’s Best NAC Detox Regulators’ very useful for OCD. I tried NAC from another brand too ‘Now Foods’ without the cofactors and can’t notice anything so I recommend choosing the doctor’s best brand only particularly if using for reducing OCD. NAC668×1221 77 KB Effects it give is it reduces inattention, increases information processing speed and thus reduces hyperfocus and stuck states which is contributing to OCD obsessions. Holy Basil aka Tulsi. Its available in both tea and capsule form. Both useful. If looking for a suitable brand then choose Organic India as they have a vast range of products based on Tulsi and also their Tea have strong concentration of Tulsi. Make sure to choose Tulsi alone type and not with added ingredients and flavors. Tulsi353×626 58.8 KB Effects: It calms the 
mind and thus help to think clearly thus reduces impulsiveness. TMG or Trimethylglycine. Choose 500 mg per day as suitable dose. Tested with Swanson TMG. TMG403×647 61.1 KB Effects: It acts like a mood improving drug due to its ability to create serotonin in brain just like SSRI but without any side effects of SSRI like sexual dysfunction, memory problems, fatigue etc instead it actually improves libido, memory and energy levels. It reduces compulsion part of OCD and thus help to quickly get rid of OCD thoughts from mind and very useful for reducing anxiety. There might be more such supplements and will update this thread after testing. If anyone find some useful supplements, herbs for OCD please share. Thank you"

174373272,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Sex-specific effects of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms on schizophrenia with methylation changes. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Comprehensive psychiatry , Aug 2019 19 Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the critical enzyme in biotransformation. The polymorphism of MTHFR is a risk factor for schizophrenia. However, whether the MTHFR polymorphism is associated with schizophrenia disease phenotypes and what is the underlying mechanism of MTHFR polymorphism in schizophrenia is under-investigated. In this study, we aim to verify the correlation between MTHFR polymorphisms and clinical features of schizophrenia, while exploring the differential genomic methylation and disease related genes as the potential targets for schizophrenia.242 patients of schizophrenia and 234 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Polymorphisms of MTHFR from three sites (C677T, A1298C, G1793A) were examined by Taqman fluorescence prob
e method in leukocytes from all subjects. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), trail making test (TMT) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were checked on patients. Genomic methylation was tested and analyzed in fields of differential methylation positions (DMPs) and enrichment of genes that are potentially related to schizophrenia.Schizophrenic patients showed higher frequency of MTHFR polymorphisms at both single and multiple sites than healthy controls. Our data also showed that MTHFR C677T and multiple-site polymorphisms were positively correlated with PANSS positive rating, not negative score in male schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, while a significant reduction of global DNA methylation level was observed in schizophrenic patients, we also identified several genes which differentiated between schizophrenia and healthy controls at methylation levels.This is a pilot study revealing that MTHFR polymorphisms at both single and multiple sites are related to the risk of schizophrenia and pos
itive symptom of the disease. The risk of MTHFR polymorphism in schizophrenia and the clinical symptoms was only significant in male patients. While the sex-specific risk of MTHFR in schizophrenia is new and the reasons remain unanswered. Our methylation analysis suggested that there was significant hypomethylation of genomic DNA in schizophrenia patients with no sex difference. The correlation between MTHFR polymorphism and schizophrenia may attribute to the change of DNA methylation level, and some certain genes could be potential research objects for MTHFR effects on schizophrenia."

176122873,"It is a frightening prospect to have to get on a such a heavy duty type of med, I completely get where you’re coming from. Hopefully you can avoid weight gain. Speaking for myself, my appetite increased and never really shut off, so to speak, and I craved carbs almost exclusively. There are probably ways to combat that. I was actually able to lose weight last year by ignoring my cravings but then life happened and I turned to food to cope, and well… I guess I can’t exactly blame risperidone for that."
176122874,"I posted this on reddit and it was a bit cathartic so I though it would post it here as well. So in 2016 I had a psychotic break. I spent some time wandering multiple states on and off homeless, lost my apartment in Boston and my job, dropped out of college, and eventually made my way back to my parents house in another city. This lead to them obviously seeing I was psychotic and they had me admitted to the psych ward in 2018 after two years of crazy. The first night I was in a holding area and had to sleep on a chair under a fluorescent light. The next day I was moved to the psych ward where I got to meet my first roommate. He was an older man that wore diapers but also managed to pee all over himself and leave the diapers around the room. That night he decided to stand in the corner of the room and loudly masturbate so I went and laid down on the floor in the hallway to get some rest. They moved me to another room where my roommate screamed at me for half an hour about how I was the devil and des
erved to be in a psych ward because I was a bad person. Then I went into the hallway after having enough to lay on the floor they took my mattress and put in on the floor in the seclusion room so I could get some sleep. I slept on the floor under a light for 2 days until another bed opened up. My new roommate would have conversations with his voices about me and walk laps around my bed all night. After a week of that I ended up getting my own room because I was the youngest on the ward and I stayed for another two weeks. They then released me still completely psychotic and my parents were going to put me in a group home because they couldn’t handle me. After about a month my psychosis cleared up and I went back to school and I’ve been pretty much fine since."

Most people are anonymous, there’s plenty of people who feel unimportant. You just gotta keep trying and keep going to find a little something for yourself and get a little something out of life. Just because someone appears happier than us doesn’t mean they’re more important. Many of us feel the same way you do at times. Lots of people feel unimportant and insignificant. But it’s a big world and we still carve a little place for ourselves in the world. You will probably never have a completely normal life but it’s rare for a person not to have someone, sometime who likes them. That person who likes you exists and is out there somewhere.

174373289,"I may have something like “strong, very opposed to persuasion delusion” about Aspies (especially female), I may think that it is a fact that every aspijka (girl or woman with Asperger’s or similar disorders like NVLD or SCD) do not defecate and urinate, especially do not defecate. Or at least their urine has really pleasant, flowery or fruity odor and does not stink after being left for at least some hours. I may also think that their feces are chocolate with smells like chocolate - really pleasantly. Or at least are fresh ketchup which smells like good ketchup. Their rear ends should smell pleasantly like flowers, fruits (of course not durian ), chocolate or ketchup. I might have “delusions” that I do not need trace elements like molybdenum or manganese when I was about 13 - 15 years old. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome (AS) when I was about 17 years old, in 2008. About this time I have also diagnosis of OCD and get medication. I received first diagnosis from schizophrenia spe
ctrum 27.1.2015, it was schizophrenia-type disorder (F21 from ICD-10 classification). I had diagnosis of unprecised (just F20) or paranoid schizophrenia (F20.0) for some time in 2016 years, I even took 7,5 mg of aripiprazole three times in III 2016, but I had marked side effects after it (their were really unpleasant). Now I have diagnosis of schizotypal, AS and OCD. I take four medications: paroxetine (40 mg at morning, due to OCD), chlorprothixene (15 mg at morning, maybe also against OCD, not psychotic spectrum disorders), sulpiride (200 mg at morning, it is rather against psychoses) and 5 mg of olanzapine at evening (due to schizotypal disorder). Earlier I got 10 mg of olanzapine and 400 mg of sulpiride (not only 200 mg at morning, but also 200 mg at evening), but “schizotypal” symptoms were still present, I would say that the situation was then the same as now, when doses of olanzapine and sulpiride are smaller. Despite taking 40 mg of paroxetine regularly, I still have “severe” OCD, I would say 
that it is even worse that about 7 years ago, when I had not infection/contamination obsessions and oathing obsessions. I would say that my OCD worsens with age."

Honestly, the fact that you’re considering this at all is like the ultimate sign of progress, because the more we recover, the more we think about things that have nothin

The reason I believe that these forums are good for recovering schizophrenics is because we can praise one another for our achievements while still making sure that each of us remembers where we came from, how bad things can get, and how vital it is that we keep our forward momentum. That’s not to say that there will never come a time where switching antipsychotics to lose weight will be a brilliant decision, but you’re not there yet, and that’s okay.

I’ve been thinking about what I kept and I think since I’m leaving snow country I can actually get rid of some of the sweaters I initially kept, so I think I can get rid of another bag now that I’ve thought it through more. Then there’s no reason I can’t pack up the cold weather clothes that I’m keeping. I will actually have something packed making this whole thing all the more real. Today I’m either going to go through paperwork, like bank statements and tax documents or photos. I really am. Really. lol Yes I am talking myself into it. Yesterday my husband finally spoke on his plans for the future. That’s a huge step in the right direction. Here in the next few days I’ll be able to open up the dialogue about what he wants to take with him so I can start posting things for sale on-line. That will feel great to start getting rid of stuff. It is sort of 
odd going through the house putting mental price tags on all your belongings. It’s weird to think all these years of collecting possessions boils down to a $5 bill from a stranger and my stuff is just gone. It’s strangely liberating and sad at the same time. But mostly liberating."

176123010,Two years ago I drove to San _NAME_ where YouTube headquarters is located and started screaming all this crazy stuff. The cops investigated me and then I got pulled over a week later and the cops were super nice but I thought they were secret service agents they brought me to the hospital . I thought they were secret service because I was campaigning for president. The few months that followed I thought _NAME_ connely was my real mother and I was gonna marry _NAME_. In the hospital they wrote down I was making terrorist threats. I wasn’t. I’m much much better now
176123011,I do self harm to numb the emotional pain but it’s a unhealthy coping skills. Please tell your pdoc of psychologist this is a serious problem which can lead to greater issue. I do it for my PTSD but it causes problems in relationship and can make people afraid you will go to far. Just remember people without mental illness sometimes just don’t understand.

My weight is lower than it has been in years, and I’m not willing to put in much more effort to lose more. Once food stops being enjoyable and starts being a chore, I stop eating. That’s not healthy either. I have already redirected my diet quite a bit and I’m happy with that."

176123043,"What’s paradoxical about paranoia is that delusional thinking feels more natural than non-paranoid perspectives. You have to opt to believe differently… the only difficulty is that the healthy thoughts feel delusional… even the comfort feels unrealistic and the mind then reverts back to more paranoid perspectives. Opt to believe what’s healthy for you… repeat the thoughts or even say them aloud… let yourself know it takes some adjusting… and that adjustment can only set in with faith, trust, adherence to the practice. For so long my mind just wouldn’t shake the feeling that I deserve this crappy experience. Truth be told though… no one chose this for us and we frankly don’t deserve it. Embrace peace when it sets in, learn how to craft it for yourself… and also know you deserve it."

Best to get it under control, I have to be medicated. My unmedicated self avoids meds because of various delusional paranoias but the fact is either God or Mother Nature doesn’t make us all perfect hence survival of the fittest. Humans use tools, medication is a tool to function in society, being sz has its benefits but in a more mad max type of way, ie when I’m unmedicated I win fights and it makes me more imposing. But. That’s not helpful unless you’re in the movie Fight Club. It gets in the way, imo it’s a genetic artifact that was once helpful for survival but is no longer needed and in fact gets in the way, like a tail.

So I have a knee brace now and I was prescribed meloxicam for inflammation, though I have not noticed it does anything. The only thing that really helps is icing it. I have work tomorrow and I am anxious. I have no clue why. I always get such bad anxiety before work. Anyone else get bad anxiety before work? I got anxiety before work even going back to when I was just a swim teacher. I just don’t get it but it kills me. I also have been extremely irritable, just getting nasty angry at everything.

But, once you start to look into the record, you’ll see that the officials at Guinness, at the time, weren’t well known for verifying the records they posted, and this was, in fact, not a record that they checked. They took _PERSON_ at his word, and it seems that he completely invented the number. On a number of television programs _PERSON_ demonstrates near perfect recall and excellent reading. In 1998, he had a lawsuit filed against him for deceptive advertising. The lesson here is really quite simple: there is, in fact, a great deal of deception in the field of speed reading.

Because words that contain the root psyche (e.g., psychiatrist , psychiatry , etc.) are associated with the essence of life (usually related to the soul or human spirit) psychosis has come to mean that a person has lost the essence of life—that he or she has developed a private view of the world or a private reality not shared by others"

My inaugural month showed great improvement on almost ever symptom. But then we ran into a unforseen issue, and that was the insurance company didn’t want to cover it because it was too new of a medication. So I went back on 4mg of risperdal for about a month, before we could get it worked out. I am now on caplyta again, and decreasing my risperdal dosage, to which I am on 1mg.

176123214,Three years ago at the board & care I had to share a small room with a 27 year old veteran and ex-homeless person (the same person in case you didn’t get that). We got along pretty good but it was nice when he went out and I had the room to myself. He used to be in the room all morning and stay up all night playing video games so my only alone time in the room was after dinner from roughly 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm. I really should have gone out nights but it was so relaxing and peaceful to just get on my laptop and relax alone in peace until he got back. So I forced myself to go watch TV in the TV room with people sometimes or go to the store but I eventually took the easy way out and stayed inside. For more than a year. It’s kind of like your answer _AT_MENTION_ I really got out of shape by staying in so much. I really regret that and I’m paying for it now. I should have gone for walks or gone out to coffee or walk to the store. I’m really out of shape now but I walk occasionally on my days off.

174373358,Risperidone 8mgsmade me so tired but it worked then switching doctors I was put on a very very low dose of risperidone that was absolutely worthless. I’ve been on the highest dose of latuda have been for about 5 years. It helps with the psychosis and mood of schizoaffective disorder. And adding lithium and abilify has also helped
176123220,What Are You Going On About _AT_MENTION_… . …
176123221,"Yah, hasn’t happened to me yet but is my biggest fear"
176123222,It looks as though there’s a bright light behind it but only some of it is getting through. Nice one!
174373360,"The injection takes a few days/weeks to get stronger, so there’s that. In the past I had nothing to do, so I’d just let the depression pass. When I was in uni, it wasn’t good. It’s more negative symptoms than depression lately though. Even notice slight positive symptoms too."
176123223,Please avoid the religious discussion and ideas. They are very triggering for the community in general.
176123224,"He’s very ill. He has a debilitating illness of some kind that is rendering him more and more paralyzed as the months go on. I’m not sure what it’s called. It’s something rare. Lately he’s been hallucinating. He called the police on us twice in the last week to report different incidences that were total fabrications. One he said the other neighbor’s son tried to break into his house and then fled to our house to hide and the other he said we were shooting a gun in his direction. Both times we were questioned, but I think the police and manager know he’s hallucinating. His ex-wife explained everything to us and let us know it’s his medication making him hallucinate and she was sorry for the trouble. I feel bad for him. I hope he’s going to be ok."
176123225,I’m sorry but I came here to recover from my mental illness and someone has been trying to make it worse by scaring me. I am simply a journalist and a researcher of truth.
174373356,"So I started watching videos on youtube about ancient megalithic structures that were obviously not built with primitive technology, which suggests the ancients possessed advanced building technology. Anyways, this got me thinking about conspiracies, theories, and pseudoscince etc. I watched an interview when _NAME_ claimed he was the son of God. It was funny, but at the same time, I have respect for _NAME_, even though I don’t believe in his cuckoo, made up theories. His reptilian theory is the funniest, but also the scariest Yesterday I bought his first published book ‘The biggest Secret’ as a kindle book, and I know I won’t fall for any of the made up theories, but it is definitely going to be an interesting read. I imagine some of you will believe in conspiracy theories, however some may also cross over into delusions … But let me know if you believe anything that conflicts with mainstream beliefs! Also I am not schizophrenic, so the book will not trigger me!"
176123226,how much do you smoke?
176123227,I’m sure you’ll find the right answer
176123228,I wanna get the coronavirus just to see what the big deal is
176123229,"for years and years i had a pdoc who hated me and there wasn’t much i could do about it. finally i had enough was enough in my brain and i started writing complaint letters about him to authorities he cared about. all of a sudden, he was sweet and nice and chummy towards me. figure? now i have a pdoc i like very much. he’s a beautiful person as far as i can tell. _NAME_"
176123230,I did a load of laundry. I showered. I had an easy night of teaching.
174373359,"I’m on abilify and latuda, together they kind of work but I don’t think the hyperness is going to last"
176123231,"Sorry if I sound mean, but it’s a lot to have been isolated between 4 walls since kid, without being able even to talk, while I needed love etc…"

176123233,_AT_MENTION_ . How many posts can a new member make? Do you know?
176123234,A couple of years ago I was. It wasn’t a healthy relationship.
176123235,Abilify doesn’t make me feel like a zombie have you tried it
176123236,"I mean, I’m all for ditching this friend because I’m assuming it’s the same guy that’s a douche to you pretty regularly, but he sounds like he’s just being intentionally annoying. Like when people say they don’t like the weird moist so you say it every chance you get because watching them make that squirmy face is kind of funny. So, . But I also probably wouldn’t tell him more because he does have a tendency to be a jerk and might use this against you. Hopefully it’ll blow over soon? Don’t know why it happens, though. I start getting a bit delusional/maybe psychotic if I hear my son’s name very often. Especially if we’re at the playground and there’s another kid there with his name. It really messes with me. No advice, though. I don’t know. Sorry."
176123237,"I know how it feels when your family treats you like sh*t. I know this every single day. You know, he’s still with you. He’s watching over your right now. He’s always taking care of you. He will be there when you are in pain. You can’t feel him, but he’s there- I truly believe that. I know that my unborn sister’s here with me. My mom lost her in the womb and I’ve had a dream about a sister who died and I had to bury her. I thought it was a way of her saying, “I still am here!” I think your grandfather will be very honoured to know that you are thinking of him. They didn’t do an autopsy? What? Cachexia raises red flags…that mostly has an underlying medical cause. I’m not a doctor but I’m concerned. But, your grandfather is in peace now. Please do not worry and keep remembering him. Death is a hard thing. So hard. I’m thinking of you."

176123249,"The nice thing about paranoia is I can see who is a crook and who isn.t, these doctors and psychiatrists want to make us totally dependent on their drugs. It.s a dual edged sword. We need them, yet that as much as you.d think."
174373362,"I felt the same with 3 weeks of abilify. I didn’t sleep,at all, 2 nights. But, miracously, i didn’t went psychotic. After a while i slept 5 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours…but i usually used to sleep 10 hours. It concerns me a little. I was taking invega before."
176123250,I’ve vanished out my country without a trace… hoping to exist again there
174373365,I’m a few months in on sustena. Have had some positive symptoms in the past month. Nothing really bad though. Excited for when I eventually get to switch to Trinza and do every 3rd month or so.
176123251,i am terrible for touching my face i do it all the time
176123252,"I’m not doing great physically, but I feel pretty young in spirit. I go for walks and try to excersise every now and then, but I had a insomnia period of over 3 years which really drained me. Luckily I am able to sleep pretty normal now, but I think I might have lost some of my life durability due to insomnia."
176123253,"Some of us get angry about death - that we shouldn’t have to die. But we do have to die - hopefully it’s not until we have lived a long and sometimes fruitful life. Eventually, though, we wear out. And death is welcome."
174373369,"I know that’s why I don’t play Doom and zombies games. I used to play Doom all day. I used to watch Dr House too, I loved it."

176123257,My brain is malfunctioning as I type this. I’m beginning to read double/ triple meanings into many things…getting mixed messages and meanings from information.
176123258,I’ve been taking melatonin since I was a teen. It doesn’t give me any issues. And it probably is safe for 99% of people. I’ve never heard of there being a risk with it unless you have some unusual condition.

174373366,"If you’re going to war at least be smart about it. Don’t flip off any policemen. Try to put some eloquence on your situation and get people to understand what you have been through. You can find others who have experienced what you have. Talk to them and find out what has helped them. I know you’d like to destroy patriarchy, or you will in the future, but try to use fresher language to describe your pain. Remember, the pen is mightier than the sword."
176123260,In the beginning it was bad dreams and random ones mixed in. I had a very dysfunctional childhood so I would have dreams about a lot of the traumas I dealt with. I started therapy 2 months ago and a lot of those dreams have stopped so now I have random dreams and once in a while I’ll have a nightmare.
176123261,Sorry everyone I think I might have slammed the keyboard again when I was upset
174373363,I don’t actually remember I think I liked dressing up and music but I cant do neither of those now no money and the meds make my negative symptoms worse. I also cant enjoy music so listening to it does nothing for me. I kinda am hoping to reinvent myself next year but I fist have to try a new med I think.
176123262,I asked her. She says she has to diagnose for insurance purposes. Regardless I agree with her. She’s no typical therapist. She knows her stuff. I’ve dealt with tons of therapists before.
176123263,"When I used to be in church I had those exact same thoughts and a pastor once told me the unpardonable sin is when you completely misplace the HS good actions for another entities (specifically and evil one) and thank that entity instead. I think you have to fully reject him, after that your heart hardens and you don’t care anymore. I can say this because I know that feeling… If you really did commit it you wouldn’t feel guilty at all."
176123264,"Never been homeless (thank goodness), but I was thinking about running away to Maine last December. That would have been tough, what with no money, and nowhere to stay. Glad I didnt."

176123268,"There are numerous poorly constructed buildings on the coasts of the eastern US, and the Gulf of Mexico. During the Winter and Spring they are used as stores and gas stations. Each one of them has a camera used by the Weather Channel or a storm spotter. Businesses looking for insurance handouts pay for the building of the structures. On June 1st the items are taken out of the buildings. And every year in the Summer and the Fall on the Weather Channel one or more of these buildings are destroyed by the tropical storms and hurricanes that hit the coastline to the delight of the announcers on the Weather Channel. I just saw one fall today. It’s going to be a long season."

176123273,"My personal belief: experiencing psychosis permanently changes you. You can achieve baseline again, but that baseline’s been moved a couple points in a different direction. It’s all about learning what your “new normal” is. But yes, you can definitely get back a sense of normalcy with this illness-- just takes time, meds, and effort."
176123274,"I am on 80mg latuda and zoplicone when needed. I was on 120 mg but the dr said I can go down to 80 and I have. I feel restrained like I’m tied up and twisted and I have been binge eating today and my brain does not feel good in the evenings and I’m a bit sad now and I feel hated by people and lonely because I just don’t seem to fit I. Or get along with people etc not connect etc I don’t feel good with those at course or volunteer work so much I think about quitting so I don’t have to be around them but I feel that way around some of my own family too n I know some of them hate me like my sister who disrespects me but am well n stable and nolonger have delusions,voices etc"
176123275,u r welcome anytime. God bless.
176123276,But you’re disappointing yourself. I know it cuts deep. But maybe it’s just not the right fit for you. That’s ok. Not every person is meant for every job. What do you do well at your current job? Try to find that in your next job. What aren’t you doing well at? Try to avoid that within reason at your next job. You’re very bright. You definitely have the ability to do a real career type job.

176123279,My dad used to say he didn’t want to go out in public with us because we were always bruised from our anemia and it made him look like he beat us.
174373374,I think it’s very interesting. There’s a bit about being “hospitalized for an infection” that got me thinking if I ever had been. I haven’t. At least not that I can remember. But it did remind me of the times I was hospitalized for some issue with my esophagus as a kid. By miracle I remembered the name of the condition and did a quick search. It is in fact an autoimmune condition. As are both of my skin conditions. Do you have autoimmune conditions?
176123280,Oh you guys in Europe dont use the DSM-5?
176123281,my goal is to stay a full day at work and not get angry there despite… _NAME_
176123282,Thanks _AT_MENTION_! Glad you liked it
176123283,Omg. That was off meds yea? What job was that?
176123284,"Truly truly my experience too with meeting requirements for diagnosis. I met them all. I honestly thought my husband poisoned me years ago. I have seen creatures appear, people say things they say they didn’t, I literally heard voices in my room all around me taunting me for 1st time as a teen. I thought I was being possessed though. It’s just crazy I was in denial for so long and it was so obvious. I mean I had to know. I thought there were cameras implanted and I thought I could read peoples minds for the longest at one time. I think my problem is with patterns. I see them everywhere and my delusions are fed by them and interwoven. I somehow get convinced that it’s normal world. That I’m somehow just tuned into a higher frequency. It’s hard to shake this whole life faith I built."

176123292,That’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. I forgot about it completely. I feel like a decent story teller and actor. It’s been five years. I get pretty bored with the same ol story. Am I that good of a trained actor or did I actually believe the story? That’s for the listener of the story to decipher.
174373382,"Thanks for mentioning this. I was wondering why I felt so good and felt so grateful for my life because of how good I felt I suppose during the midst of psychosis. Now I don’t feel depressed but don’t feel particularly happy. I’m usually worried about things but am starting to feel better. I’m diagnosed schizoaffective, so maybe negative symptoms aren’t that pronounced in this disorder."

174373377,"Have you tried glycine? webmd.com Glycine: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Dosage, and Warning Possibly Effective for Schizophrenia. Taking glycine by mouth along with conventional medicines seems to reduce certain symptoms of schizophrenia, called negative symptoms, in some people who don’t respond to treatment with conventional medicines. Stroke. Taking glycine under the tongue for 5 days may help to reduce brain damage due to a stroke that was caused by the blockage of a blood vessel (usually by a clot) in the brain. Its proven effective for negative symptoms not just placebo like other things. Another thing which works similar to glycine is taurine. The striking similarity is both glycine site agonists. I have not tried glycine directly instead DMG, dimethylglycine and I found it useful for improving mood may be helping negative symptoms."

It just seems to creep up on me, and before I know it, I am in it, and perceiving a world against me. How can I avoid this and stay sane indefinitely? What do I do wrong in order to get back into such a state?"

176123387,"To me, “recovering” and “a full recovery” are two different things. “Recovery” is an ongoing thing, it’s any progress you make against symptoms and it means functioning better. A “full recovery” means the disease and symptoms are gone and you are healthy and you don’t need medication. I don’t know if this is possible. I’m not usually negative but many doctors say that many people make a full recovery. I’ve heard many people on here claim a full recovery but there’s always that little bit of information they may hold back so that when people grill them on their recovery they admit they still hear voices or have delusions still like me or paranoia like me, or they still take meds or they claim a full recovery and disappear for several months and then come back and tell us how they relapsed, etc. I just can’t recall anyone who’s symptoms all went away and they did not need any medication. It just makes me very cynical when people claim a full recovery. I neve met anyone 
on here who could convince me they recovered completely and I’ve never run into it in real life. Don’t get me wrong, I would love everybody on here to fully recover, but I don’t know what the chances of that are."

Caplyta didn’t work at all, so I cycled through a few other meds before landing back on Vraylar. I took Vraylar in the past. I don’t really want to get into that story of why I stopped it back then. But anyway, I’m taking 4.5mg of Vraylar and I have pretty bad insomnia on it. It takes about an hour for me to fall asleep, I toss and turn, and then I wake up super early. Sometimes 3am, sometimes 5am, sometimes 7am. And then I can’t go back to sleep. I just have to get up and get ready for the day. This is mostly a problem for my husband because I wake him up and if I get ready for the day, all the noise and light disturbs his sleep even more. It’s a problem for me, too, if I get sleepy while driving during the day. For the most part, though, I don’t feel very tired during the day. I like not feeling tired. Whe

It was dripping off of an icicle and each drop glowed with an intense brightness as the sun shined through as every drop built up before gaining enough weight to fall to the ground. I could see the snow transform before my eyes. I have an intense desire to make the world a better place. I focus so much on that desire that I never really looked and saw just how beautiful the world already is, even through my psychotic ears and eyes. I guess in a way, my resentment melted away like the snow. Drop by drop splattering to the ground. For the first time in a long time I dont have a passive death wish. I want to live. I want to do something amazing, and try to add a little bit of beauty to the world. I want to help people shine as bright as those sun magnified drops of melting snow. For the first time in a long time I’m grateful. I’m 
grateful for every moment in my life, both the good and the bad. I have trauma, as many here do. I’ve seen some of the ugliest things that society has to offer, both done to me and to others. I know it sounds facitious to say that I’m grateful for the bad. It sounds silly, doesnt it? I mean who the hell could be grateful for being abused, bullied, mentally ill, and a laundry list of crap that has turned me into the resentful man that I have become? My therapist has tried to drill into my head to live in the moment, and to try to stop looking towards the future to be happy. I always tell myself “when I accomplish this I’ll be happy.” I never am though. A scary thought shot through me as I stared at that melting snow, what if I die before I accomplish my current objective that is supposedly going to grant me instant happiness?

I have more energy throughout the day and have been motivated to start exercising regularly again like I used to. (Now training 5 times a week!) I have not noticed weight gain while on it either. The nausea I experienced on Saphris went away after a week of taking it, and has not returned. Saphris can cause nausea and even some vomiting at first, but this goes away relatively quick. Still experiencing lack of erections, but that is most likely my prolactin still elevated from before. In 2-3 month’s time, I am hoping to regain my sexual function. For anyone considering a new AP to try, Saphris is well worth a try. If you can get over the taste since it’s sublingual, it can be a great medication. Personally, the taste does not bothe

176123481,You’re not the first one to call me cryptic. I meant to explain that he did not want me to be active in any way for fear I’d get hurt but that his violence was the unavoidable danger he seemed to try to protect me from. I call it his having hostile fears.
176123482,Intermittent fasting is so healthy for you. Only if you can do it and don’t succumb to binge eating. My sis is doing it atm Keto diet doesn’t work for me. Best of luck if you can do it it can be difficult for some people
176123483,Wow. My delusion is so embedded in me. It just don’t want to go away. This is scary I need to learn how to manage.
176123484,I know the men are there watching me even when I can’t see them

176123490,"Goodness me, sixteen pages?!"
176123491,Have you tried DMG yet? Its useful for seizure too apart from antidepressant and other benefits.
176123492,Thank you _AT_MENTION_
176123493,Despite i am functional and reading books And taking medication i feel i am not normal may be it is anxiety i dont know i feel i am not normal What is it ? Anyone know ?
176123494,Right back atcha.
174373429,"It’s understandable that you’re feeling low with news like this. I have had issues with work, and the sticking plaster that I was given was an antidepressant on top of my AP. It seems to have now lifted my mood enough that I am more resilient than before. Maybe it might be worth a try to get yourself stable before you reach out for new employment? It’s common in the industry I work in that contracts change hands on a regular basis. I have avoided the fall out on a few occasions. I hope they can accommodate you else where."
176123495,Seems mixed mood ended today. Pretty tired after that but man feels much better to not have all that agitated impulsive anger for no reason. Cheers to a new year
174373432,"I sometimes feel like an animal, or that im trapped In my own body, i cant do anything without them watching me. I belive its spirits/demons, sometimes they can say things and after a while a person i meet will say the axactly same thing. And there is other things, that makes me know this is not my own imagination. Everytime i breathe i hear words Then im in shower the water turns in to words, if i touch something its Sound like words I hear voices, my own inner voice is controlled in the start, i Think i was crazy becuse i thought no one could do that, but before i get sick i was pretty normal, and after i begin to have some very crazy thoughts. But i wish you so mutch peace and love, the best thing you Can do is, try to aviod Alchohol, coffeine, and try to eat so healthy as possible. And maybe speak with the doctors to get more than one medication so you get 2 diffrent everyday. And be strong and never give up, 1 out Off 10 people with schizophrenia kills them self its very sad Numbers. But we Ca
n get better and i feel better now than before, but it Can take some years, but its worth it in the end. We should never give up becuse an illness becuse thats what they want. <3"
176123496,when they gave me meds i wasn’t really busy with if it would work or not cause i was really absorbed in the things i experienced at that time. It’s only later in the psych ward that i started to think about it.
176123497,"I don’t have first hand experience, but I’ve heard that mushrooms are dangerous for everyone. I knew one guy who had a very bad trip on shrooms, and then he quit taking all drugs and became very religious."
176123498,For most it’s not a choice. Psychosis is brain damage. That is proven. It’s commonly reported you lose iq by 5%. You need to take stock and step away. We are pro meds here simply because over time it works. I’ve seen so many horror stories over the years simply because people don’t take or stop their meds. _AT_MENTION_ This may not be the place for you and it only damages the community.
176123499,Try a cup of coffee with it. It seems to work well for me.
176123500,Thread re-opened per OP’s request.
176123501,I never searched for any symptoms lmao Where did you get that from
176123502,I put on 35 kilos on Olanzapine Since 2015 I have refused any AP that either has weight gain as a main side effect or makes me fat. Will not tolerate this ever again as it’s unacceptable
176123503,I’m kinda gonna go the oppositeway and say it’s ok to feel How you are feeling. Your feelings of frustration and anger are valid. It’s ok to be upset. However have you thought about channeling those feelings into positive activities? Activities that you could then look back on and feel good about yourself rather than angry?
176123504,Have you ever done it? Have you ever been crashed in on yourself? I came across a couple that was having an intimate moment and I felt like an intruder. I was also intruded on by my Mom and a neighbor while playing doctor with the neighbor’s daughter when I was a kid. Makes me mad to think of it now. They knew something was going on and just wanted to embarrass and disturb us it seems to me.
176123505,Hope it all goes well. If it leads to better services or outcomes I’d say it’s worth the drama of going through all that testing. Hang in there.
176123506,"I´m sorry. I empathize with everyone that couldn´t rely on anyone and had to go through this alone. And yeah, therapists are allways the first people in the plot! _AT_MENTION_ I´m glad you didn´t trust those damn halogens!"
176123507,_NAME_ has some great vocals… reminds me of a guy I once knew in New York. Gotta love glass cages.
176123508,"Thankyou so much, _AT_MENTION_, it is good to hear someone else say that. _AT_MENTION_ I think that is the hard part, if I continue in a bad habit for a long long long time, I would defo feel ????, because I feel like I should be more disciplined. (again I am not referring to others since I am not in other’s shoes) But at the same time I understand that habits can be hard to undo since they are so hardwired in the brain, it is not a smooth journey so I need to be forgiving towards myself."
176123509,Yeah good job matey! Nice to get some kudos for a job well done and pat yourself on the back. Well done you!
176123510,"I pretty much need a sedative. Along with depixol, 400mg of seroquel covers most of my psychosis. But I personally think I need 600mg for the anxiolytic and sedative effect. I have sz and anxiety dx simultaneously"

176123522,"inside mind. sounds horrific. sorry to read you’ve been through all that. I’ve had an awful pdoc once a long time ago. he wound me up in the hospital, actually I had to push for going to the hospital myself I felt so sick. but now I have a pdoc I am crazy about. he is sooooooo nice and understanding. keep up the hoping inside mind. there are good docs and pdocs out there. _NAME_"
176123523,"Actually, I wanted to know if it could come from an old trauma?"
176123524,"I don’t understand gaslighting. I have looked it up many times but cannot seem to commit it to memory properly. They don’t care. Their algorithms just churn away at your data selling you ????, and they have massive bank balances as a result. I am sure they couldn’t care less as long as you buy into it"
176123525,Then you have something else. That’s not covid19 symptoms.
176123526,I’m more concerned about my boyfriend that passed watching me on the toliet.

176123531,"You will have people who you can talk to, and nothing can harm you there. If you can’t get into the hospital see if you can get respite care. Basically, that is just a few days of rest. It can help."
176123532,I take this. Pretty cheap. Anyone else take probiotics? I think it clears my thoughts and reduces my psychosis. Could be a delusion itself or the placebo effect. I’m still drinking the energy drinks. I’m hoping an ADHD diagnosis and an expert can help me.
176123533,"For years I’ve been unable to listen to music, have the radio or TV on in the background etc, because I think I hear mumbling messages in the background noise. They are sending me messages but I don’t know what they are. I’ve never thought of this as ‘hearing voices’ because I seem to hear them with my mind rather than my ears. They are not an auditory hallucination, but a misinterpretation of environmental sounds. Would you guys think this qualifies as ‘hearing voices’?"
176123534,why so extreme?
176123535,I take Vitafusion Men’s Multivitamin. I believe there’s a place for supplements especially when you can get enough of certain supplements in your diet.

176123556,Not proud but I’m learning to love everything that’s part of me. Ie without things I gone thru I wouldn’t be me so they are there for a reason to make me me. Might aswell think like that since the things have happnd
174373444,First time when I was out on risperidone it lasted one year for me. After that I talked with my pdoc and she put me on abilify for around three years. After this med I was being put on invega for like three years and now I’m on risperidone drops 4ml and abilify 2.5 mg. I am taking antipsychotics since seven years ago. The meds I took we’re good for me but only for like three years some of them. How long a med change lasts for you approximately?
176123557,I tried the ice pack and took a tylenol and feel better. Thank you for putting up with me.
176123558,"Thanks for the response! Yeah, it feels awful the whole thing about telling or having to hide something. Glad everything is going well for you!

I have been on olanzapine before without gaining weight."

176123563,All this crap about fish oil not helping with mental illness is bs. I’ve been on it almost a year and I notice a difference.
176123564,I respect their wishes. People are very different and have a right to their preferences as long as they’re not harming people.
176123565,Some people almost expect to get sorta “high” from the depot injection. Its purely to make you feel normal. And if your positives have cleared off you know its working. Maybe you need an anti-depressant added to your regime.
176123566,Why is the _NAME_ show a rubbish analogy? It literally feels like that. The Matrix is too impersonal to encompass that delusion. The delusion is such that you feel like everyone is playing a scripted role centering around your life.

176123568,Don’t put so much pressure on yourself.
176123569,i think punishment that happen to me along these long years change my personality to strange personality i feel it like human experiment i feel it is opression what happening to me
176123570,I suggest talking to your pdoc about this. You may be thinking and feeling this way because of your mental illness and are not really a sociopath at all.
176123571,What med did you switch to _AT_MENTION_ ?
176123572,No voices No unusual beliefs No negatives Nothing.
176123573,"I wash my face - and that’s all. I use very few toiletries - just soap, body wash and shampoo and scented baby powder. No moisturisers, deodorant, perfume or other things."
176123574,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_,I loved him but he made me feel bad and ugly,my therapist says that’s because he is bipolar and change his mood. My family really hate him because they see me suffer"
176123575,"I kind of did that and it worked out OK. I unloaded trucks for four years from 1993-1997. But near the end I burned out and I called in sick too much and kept asking for fewer hours the last four months. I was highly successful at this job for quite awhile but I finally quit; things changed, new people got hired. Too many changes so I quit and joined a day program. The program wasn’t terribly strict or hard so I went there 3 or 4 days a week. We had groups and art classes, chores, breaks, watched videos on a VCR, ate lunch. After about 8 or 9 months a counselor came up to me and she had an ad she clipped out of the newspaper that a company was looking for a park ranger, no experience necessary. I thought no way could I do it but the counselor had faith in me so I applied and became a park ranger, lol! I ended up staying almost two years. Actually the job wasn’t what I pictured it to be. I pictured walking through greenery, seeing lots of animals, friendly park goers asking me questions about tr
ees and deer. The reality was much different. It involved a lot of emptying garbage cans and picking up trash, cleaning restrooms, lots of being bored out of mind just sitting around for hours. It had it’s good points like I got my own pick-up truck to patrol the parks, I had a cool uniform and I had a lot of responsibility. But occasionally there was a lot of hard work. Anyways, that was my highest status job and I’m glad I did it. But yeah, taking off 9 months didn’t hurt me at all. I adjusted to working again with no problem. And now 20 years later I’m still working and I plan to ride this job out until they fire me or I drop in my tracks from fatigue which is very likely."
176123576,They’re always messing up thumbs there
176123577,Yeah I’m kinda jealous of one of my younger brothers and my old college friend because they are more successful than I have been financially.
176123578,I think that’s debatable. Not my style.
174373455,I’m thinking I need more energy. I haven’t tried v8 juice before so I’ll give it a shot.

176123580,I agree with gaslighting
176123581,Maybe your flat needs a good clean.
176123582,That’s exactly what I was going to say.
174373450,I’ll be honest. I think the solution to overcoming negative symptoms is healing the blood-brain barrier. It’s working great for me so far. I’m able to do lots of things in the house since healing my BBB with PEMF and Daily Essential Nutrients. Also my symptoms are super low now. Lots of dead air between auditory hallucinations now.
176123583,"How much do you take? I take 5 mg in the morning, and sometimes at night, too, and I do okay on it. It helps me."
174373454,Abilify has me sleeping 3 hours a day right now. For the last 5 weeks. I want to sleep more so much. I’m seeing my pdoc next Tuesday so maybe I can get something to help me sleep more.
176123584,Glad to hear things are going okay. Who else lives in your foster home with you?
176123585,"With ziprasidone, I really prefer Dr _PERSON_’s generic to Apotex. When I get cranky and have no idea why, it’s usually because my pharmacy got the Apotex generic and I didn’t realize it. My pharmacy luckily knows me well enough by now that they will save some of the Dr. _PERSON_’s for me when they switch for a month or two. I accomplished this by crying in front of them multiple times."
176123586,"Attached pdf research paper from 2018, but I found this one to be fascinating. Current Psychiatry Vol. 17, No. 12 9 CATH _NAME_/AMÉLIE BENOIST Botulinum toxin, a potent neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, has been used as treatment for a variety of medical indications for more than 25 years (Box,1-12 page 10). Recently, researchers have been exploring the role of botulinum toxin in psychiatry, primarily as an adjunctive treatment for depression, but also for several other possible indications. Several studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have provided evidence that glabellar botulinum toxin injections may be a safe and effective treatment for depression. In this article, we provide an update on the latest clinical trials that evaluated botulinum toxin for depression, and also summarize the evidence regarding other potential clinical psychiatric applications of botulinum toxin.botulinumtoxin.pdf (810.6 KB)"

I’ve been on that for a long time, with no psychotic breaks. A lot of people love Geodon. It won’t put you on a pink cloud, but it is likely to control your symptoms and still allow you to be mentally acute. When they tried to switch me from Geodon to Latuda my anger issues became worse. That might have been more due to withdrawal from Geodon than a reaction to Latuda."

I don’t make the rules at this particular food bank but I have felt funny in the past about driving up in a nice car and being well dressed and not starving and making as much money as I do but still getting free groceries every two weeks and getting produce on any Monday I want. I tell this to the volunteers there and they reassure me it’s OK and my income is on file with them and I qualify under their rules. I agree that feeding kids should be the priority but I don’t feel like I’m taking food out of anybody’s mouth. I just follow the rules.

176123605,Why did I think this subject title was about some white guy being criticized by blacks?
176123606,"I don’t know I’m enraged right now, I just found hard evidence that when I got prescribed Abilify at age 14-15 my parents switched out this medication for child’s aspirin because they didn’t believe my psychosis was legitimate. They then wrote a lengthy letter to the boarding school they sent me to asking them to do the same thing and not tell me, and supposedly provided their “evidence” that I had done better on the placebo than other medications. Thinking back on it now, no wonder I still struggled with the voices all through boarding school, they never gave me appropriate medication. The boarding school manipulated me into hiding my symptoms better and making it seem like my “idea” to go off of my “meds” and when I left the program I wasn’t on any medication. They told my parents I had in fact made up the voices for attention and that they weren’t real. Anyway, I just received these medical records today and I don’t know what to do. My parents don’t know that I know, 
and that I have proof. I’m so enraged right now."

176123608,I know what you’re talking about. I still have dreams at night about when I was working etc. You didn’t do anything to deserve it. It’s just bad luck.
174373458,"You are not ugly, please don’t think that way. You know, I wasted 3 years of my life in bed too because of a physical illness. I couldn’t get up because I had extreme fatigue. I couldn’t eat. I threw up anything I ate. I had to drink shakes because I couldn’t tolerate food. I had nonepileptic seizures. I hated myself because my friends were graduating but I couldn’t do anything. My advice is to not beat yourself up because you can’t do certain things. If you beat yourself more, you will crash. You will not feel confident in yourself. Also, please switch your meds to something better. There are other med options, like geodon and paliperidone. Invega seems to work well for some patients. Risperidal can be quite sedating and exasperate your symptoms. I would highly recommend talking with your doctor."

176123610,"I’m on my way home. I’m wondering if I’m just losing it. I don’t know if my things aren’t where they should be because I moved them and forgot, or something else happened. One time, the sliding door to my bathroom was open and half the coats were on the floor. Another time someone had rewrapped a present and ruffled things in my open suitcase. It’s just little things, and it kills me not knowing if I did them or someone else did."
176123611,"Our kitchen is in boxes so too much junk food the last two days. I have stayed in my calorie targets, which has been hard. Had a slice of pizza and three deep fried cauliflower bites for lunch with two cups of fresh fruit. Supper will be another slice of pizza and more fruit."

176123613,It is disrespectful to take parts of peoples’ sentences and respond to them out of context. Even if you mean well.
176123614,I’m surrounded by people who aren’t aware of each other but what they all have in common is they want me to give up and they don’t want me to have even a spark of life. And I’m not doing anything wrong but they act like I am.
176123615,Yep it’s heavy duty
176123616,I think you expect too much of the general public.

176123621,I find symptoms return in the afternoon to evening. Probably because I’m tired and worn out by this time of day.
174373462,I try to find the cause of the problem and fix it. I had addiction issues for 8 years bcz of Abilify. When it got extreme and I couldn’t pay debts I knew there is a serious problem and that I wasn’t like that before taking Abilify. It was very hard to talk about my addictions and hypersexuality that started with Abilify use. I couldn’t believe that a chemical can do this until my psychiatrist said its possible and stopped my Abilify. No more addictions or hypersexuality now. They took some weeks to stop after stopping Abilify.
176123622,I took extra ziprasidone yesterday and that made me more tired. I think the ap meds cause fatigue in higher dose. Some caffeine helps.
176123623,"_AT_MENTION_ , I had to wait 33 years before I found the meds that worked on me. That’s how long it took for pharmacological science to advance enough to help me."

176123626,"I lost 50 pounds in a year. I did one meal a day (OMAD), intermittent fasting, and maybe one 48 hour fast a week for the entire year and I lost all the weight. I also quit all refined sugar and I’ve never been more clear headed and healthier for it. 6 years on Seroquel I put on that 50 pounds, and I lost it all. It was hard but worth every penny. I’ve kept it off for over a year now."

174373460,"I was born with it. Started hearing voices at 5, having what I thought were paranormal experiences at age 9, self-harming at 12 and becoming obsessed with things I shouldn’t be obsessed with. Also developed severe depressive symptoms, and was diagnosed with SAD Got an ADHD diagnosis at 14 because that’s the diagnosis all the misfits got back then, and the psychs never dug further into seeing if there were other or maybe even environmental causes for my problems (there were!) Was put on ADHD medication that didn’t do _NAME_ shite for me other than give me tics I still have today. When I was 20 or 21, I moved to a place with better mental health care, and I got my diagnosis. The first diagnosis was schizophrenia simplex because my pdoc didn’t think my symptoms counted as positives. I moved into a group home at 25 and stayed there for two years. They helped me get clean and relearn basic life skills. Then at 27 I moved out, and not long after, I was put in the hospital and diagnosed with Paran
oid Schizophrenia, and that’s the diagnosis I have today. So to cut it short, it’s been with me all my life and most likely always will be."

174373464,I would think you would have to be a senior citizen to get in senior housing but they probably have some for mentally ill people. There is a armed forces retirement home on the beach close to where I live for seniors but they don’t take people with mental illness so that’s out for me. If anyone knows anything about affordable housing in New York City for the mentally ill that takes pets let me know. I am not low income though so I couldn’t qualify for section 8 or anything like that.

174373470,"I came off Saphris to go on clozapine when I developed TD. It was working great, and I didn’t mind the regular blood tests as I am on Coumadin and have to get them anyways. Unfortunately, my WBC count dropped, and my pdoc didn’t want it to go any lower, so she put me back on Saphris. Yesterday, however, I asked to be switched to risperdone. I don’t think it’ll make a difference in my TD, but it was suggested by a forum member that it might help with energy (I have none). Not sure if any of that helps you… Whatever you and your pdoc decide, good luck!!!"

It’s not something I planned for but now I have to deal with it. I honestly can’t tell if they’re bugging me. I’ll explain it like this (and I’ve said this before), most of the time, the only way I know someone is bugging me is when it stops. I’ll be perfectly happy sitting at my computer not bugging anyone and I’ll suddenly become aware of pressure and craziness focused on me. I try to fight it but they don’t stop until I give up and then they stop. I don’t know how to describe “pressure”, it’s just they’re messing with me and I feel it. Everybody here is mentally ill and weird stuff happens. Ah, IDK anymore. Another fine mess you’ve gotten me into _NAME_."

Wonder if it’s politics and if my own party hates on me while the ones my loved ones vote for love on me.how bizarre. Things got so much better. I was tortured before but things got better.
176123657,hey _AT_MENTION_ i hope youre doing okay. reading the scriptures is a great thing as is serving God. Part of serving God is taking care of our health including our mental health. I believe that everything will be fine when you see your dad. He loves you and cares about you. I think you should try to get some medicine so that you can sleep and relax a bit and then after a while the voices youre hearing might go away and you can go back to how it was before you started hearing all this stuff. Your dad is a good person and will help you figure out what to do about all this
176123658,"So my prolactin is up and the doctor wants to recheck it as well as testosterone and I believe thyroid. I am also supposed to see a dietician and he didn’t ok any diet pills because I was 27 BMI which is barely overweight. I just wish he could have went with the pills, I am not looking forward to changing my diet, I count calories and eat decent food I just don’t want to have to mix all the green food into my diet heavily. I am not too happy about this all but at least I forced him to talk about weight loss instead of the shoulder pain that I have that somehow got brought up. I could be doing much worse though so I will complain no longer. Everyone enjoy your weekend, I get my kids soon woohoo!"

174373474,"You say you don’t want to talk about but I have to say just as warning, you will run into people occsionally who just have a superficial knowledge of schizophrenia and medication and they think they know what’s best for you. I see your position that they are people you know and trust and you are going to be around them a lot…But psychiatrists go to school for years and study mental illness and everything related to it. And then their career is spent seeing so many mentally ill people and psychiatrists learn as they go and rack up years of experience of seeing what works and what doesn’t. I’m not putting anyone down but I think I would trust the guy who went through medical school for 10 years and has been seeing mentally ill people for years. Granted, medication isn’t for everybody, some cope without it. But the facts are that the majority of schizophrenic people can benefit from taking medication. The discovery of medications that could help mentally ill people is one of the biggest di
scoveries in the history of psychiatry It’s what got institutionallized mentally ill people out of the back wards of hospitals because they were deemed “hopeless” before medication came along. In this day and age we take medication for granted but a lot of people on these boards including myself would be in insane asylums for life if there was no medication. I’m just giving advice, I’ve never had a problem with you."

I will post the full list of the side effects it gave me one more time: -Don’t feel like taking showers/bathing -Tired when running -Low muscle strength -No motivation to work out -Anhedonia, including not enjoying listening to music anymore -Sexual dysfunction -Feeling like I have nothing to do(boredom) -Feeling like I never have anything to talk about with other people -Weight maintenance calories are now 1500 (aka weight gain) -Akathisia -Inability to laugh -Inability to cry -Can’t get drunk -Coffee has no effect -Can’t feel nostalgia -Can’t feel anger -Sleeping for 12 hours every night I was taking 75 mg of the injection for the past two years. Today is the day that I took the 50 mg injection, and next month I will take the 25 mg injection. After 
that, I will not take Invega Sustenna anymore. In the middle of this, I am switching to oral Zyprexa, so I won’t be going off meds completely. If you are also coming off Invega Sustenna, I encourage you to post any updates on your progress here. I will post in this topic atleast monthly, but maybe more often, if I feel any different regarding side effects. Hopefully in the next 6-12 months I will be free from these side effects for good.

But either way I’m in the clear with abilify according to this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928430/ RESULTS: Clozapine, and to a lesser extent olanzapine and quetiapine showed dose-dependent increases in AA. At therapeutic doses, the AA (in pmol/mL of atropine equivalents) was estimated to range from 27-250, 1-15, and 0-5.4 pmol/mL for clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine, respectively. Aripiprazole, risperidone, and ziprasidone did not demonstrate AA at any of the concentrations studied."

174373510,"hi _AT_MENTION_ I accepted I had schizophrenia when anti-psychotics relieved the psychotic symptoms I’d been plagued by my whole life. My mental illness was caused by child abuse (and genes) so it goes back a long way & is tied to early life trauma memories which have unfortunately been unprocessable in therapy. I work two library jobs & have a social life & nice friends. I’m independent. My pdoc is very ambitious for my quality of life & told me I could drink champagne, have a boyfriend, a job and a great life. The other form of acceptance is taking responsibility for my symptoms. My rage/anguish/imaginary conversations are no-one’s responsibility but mine. I need to minimise stress & triggers to reduce these symptoms. That means I put myself first which can be hard as I was brought up to put others’ emotional needs before my own. I also take responsibility by looking out for early warning signs that I’m becoming unwell such as: talking to myself in public; fridge has no food in it & can
’t remember how that happened; huge pile of dirty clothes on the floor & can’t remember how it got there. I find ap’s helpful and I’ve recently begun trialling several supplements suggested on this website’s homepage. I am feeling better on them so far - more positive emotion, mental clarity & energy at work. So I’m hopeful these will help to improve my quality of life."

176123763,Oh. Gracias . Estudié Español hace mucho tiempo en la escuela e en la universidad. Me encanta.
174373514,Hey so I was wondering about peoples experience with medications that work? I’ve been struggling to find something that works for a while because I keep having side affects too bad to continue. I just tried Abilify but it made me so sick and dizzy I couldn’t even stand up. Latuda gave me this weird asthma like affect so bad I stupidly went to the hospital. I think I’ve been on like 8? I don’t know if that’s normal or not to try that many. I have an appointment for next week to find something else but I’m super nervous. What has worked for you guys? Thanks so much.
174373506,I often think stuff like this myself but the reality for me is I wouldn’t be able to last at working for any real length of time. The thing is I could probably do the work required of whatever job I got but the interaction with other people on a daily basis gets to me after a while. I tried many times in different jobs always with the same results of having to quit because it made my schizophrenia symptoms to hard to handle. Wish there were things I could do without having to deal with other people but with no college degree there really isn’t much out there for me.
174373497,thats quite ignorant to say. Also _USER_ID_ based

176123766,If you think it’s over the line then it usually is. Couple of flags on this thread so it’s pushing the boundaries. It’s important to have _NAME_ discussions on things and I think this wasn’t out of the ballpark but remember there’s always people here to get triggered by things like this. Yes. It’s important to fight _USER_ID_ but we have our rules.
174373511,Its paranoia. You can ignore it. If its getting too bothering then pills can help but it can numb you fully meaning you might get more negative symptoms.
176123767,Just one more question: can I still get withdrawal symptoms?
176123768,I really only associate with my family and they know everything. Pretending to be an alcoholic made me laugh…double thanks.
176123769,It’s eerie that you say that. My son killed himself while on Invega.
176123770,Is it nurown by any chance??
176123771,"I feel restless and agitated. I don’t know if it’s my medication side effect, I was taking L-Theanine, it lost its effectiveness. I’m taking 3-4 pills of 0.25 mg Xanax, it’s working a bit but I have to try something new, I’m researching Lamictal."

176123773,Get a new copy of my car’s title. Get a haircut. Pay phone bill.
176123774,Im very skeptical of BPD. A couple of friends of mine were diagnosed with it when they couldnt firgure out what was wrong with them. Later on they both got different diagnosis from that. Im sure there are scenarios where it fits properly but anecdotally it seems like something that is very open ended and can be a huge red herring to someones road to recovery. That said I would explore it and not just take my word for it.
174373507,"I’m unsure if I’m experiencing negative symptoms or not. I’m a very lazy person and I’ve been that way all of my life. I’m 21 now and I was diagnosed with sza when I was 19. I only do my hair like once a month, my hygiene isn’t very good, I watch tv and get on social media all day, I don’t like talking to people except my mom _PERSON_ I live with her, when I do talk to people I don’t really know how to carry on a conversation any more. I look up things on the internet sometimes when I’m curious but I don’t really do much reading. I don’t have a job and am currently applying for disability BC I don’t want to work a job I’m not going to enjoy and I won’t be able to return to college until I’m 24 and that’s IF I get disability.

176123782,I see. Well that sucks. You won’t be in there forever though. Once when I was psychotic in the hospital I threw a coffee container at a doctor and smashed a window with a chair. I had to go to jail for like 10 days before my parents bailed me out.

174373513,How about reading a book called surviving schizophrenia It’s really informative about sz!!
176123788,"I feel my psychiatrist has at times encouraged delusional thinking. At first when I began to see him, he would simply keep quiet when I would tell him about certain theories I had or delusions I had experienced. He would simply be quiet and take down notes whole time. I understand he is supposed to do this, however, I felt his lack of response when I told him certain things would make me more suspicious of my reality. The fact that he was not outright telling me “no, that’s not true” would really put me on edge. At first I thought this was merely my perception of things and maybe he really is trying to help. But then, there have been times where he has theorised with me. When I told him I was hearing voices (this was a year ago, I no longer do), he told me that maybe I’ve opened up a cosmic gateway into another realm and I’m hearing stuff from the other side etc etc. He has also told me spiritual things could be at play etc. He asked me if I was psychic and stuff. When I look back, I can
t help but but wonder why would he encourage thinking along these lines. Like is this person really trying to help? The medication did take effect eventually and I moved out of my delusional thinking for some months, however I think I’m regressing, and I’m wondering if it makes sense to return to the same person. Any thoughts?"

176123797,"I hear an evil voice that keeps asking me, “Have you figured it out yet?” I think he is referring to how I die. The voice keeps laughing at me and saying “It’s so funny!” I think he is saying that I will die in a funny way. For some reason I keep thinking I know how I will die. Sometimes it’s an illness and sometimes it’s some sort of accident. I’m always wrong, but I keep thinking that I will be right some day. Anyone else deal with this? Thanks, _PERSON_"
174373515,"No she is not right. Schizophrenia can be managed. That is key it can be managed. There’s an argument we lose some moral “agency” due to the medication and underlying condition, but that doesn’t mean we cannot live a life free from incarceration. Because what she is suggesting is indeed incarceration. I nearly got admitted to mental rehab in March this year and had to win a tribunal to have my section (UK) lifted. As long as you always take your medication in consultation with your doctor, you should be fine. I was expected to be back in hospital this September, it’s now November and I’m doing well. After all, for those of us who eventually want to withdrawn from medication, NOBODY can tell you you can’t if your doctor provides agreement. Yet I am not recommending to come off the medication, that would be a disaster, for someone in your position, I would recommend discussing a treatment plan that provides yourself with moral principles, to avoid “hurting” your family."
176123798,"Thanks _PERSON_, thats really nice of you for taking the time to read this post."
174373516,I got anxious and paranoid on Abilify when I first started it. Maybe they can give you some medicine to help navigate that while you’re adjusting. I’ve been on it three years now and don’t have those symptoms anymore.
176123799,No. What did I miss?
176123800,"No. No fever. I think that is one of the most definitive symptoms. They took me to urgent care, and they gave me some antibiotics for my cough, and it seemed to work for a while, but now the cough is back."

176123824,Volumes have probably been written on this subject in the legal annals. The issue is so subjective that any good attorney could argue either way.

Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination – indeed, everything and anything except me."

174373522,_AT_MENTION_ The last time I tried to motivate you you opted for a thinly veiled suicide threat. I won’t have your blood on my hands so I left it at that. Can you read books at all? If you can than try _PERSON_’s ‘A new Earth’. It delves into how some people are ego led and some people thrive off negative roles if their ego cannot be fed in any other way. I suggest giving the book some effort as it may help you understand how you may be being afflicted. I wish you well on your journey.

They can back date your disability if approved. If they think your disability started two years or more before your approval date you get back pay and your medicare coverage would start right away.

174373529,I am much better with AP meds than not. I still have a lot of difficulties bc of my schizotypal personality I guess. I still have hung into some of my fears from when I has psychosis maybe. I do have things that no one believes so I don’t talk about it. The AP meds all helped a lot the same but Abilify left me with no side effects that was as bad as the others. I am really lazy or something but that could be the AP meds or brain stuff. It’s been bad since I first got sick. I’m getting a CT scan

Stop pretending… but I can’t. And that? That makes me even angrier, because the answer to the question of why I would ruin my life for a lie is simple… I wouldn’t. So why would the big eye in the sky do this to us? To me? His “truest believer.” Faith in him through faith in humanity. But his love of us? It’s not the love of a parent to his children. No, it’s the love of a storyteller to his characters, because to HIM, that’s all we are. Characters in a never ending story. It’s not a test. It’s entertainment for the divine that rule us and the god who created us. Who would’ve ever guessed it? _PERSON_ was right. God was never on our side."

176123914,"Before I was hospitalized, I ran out of my house, I tried to report my mom to the police station, nobody wanted to hear me there, they were rude and yelled at me. I went to a police station in other city, before reaching it I asked the direction to a state employee and he gave me the direction, but soon as I left he began to make loud weird sounds, like a bird (or a duck), then I reached the police station and they wanted to call my house, I told the officers the correct number 3 times and they called another number, so they called an ambulance and I had to fight against 4 policemen, finally I was hospitalized. That was a very weird situation but I believe everything has a explanation, at least I’m safe now and my wounds healed"
176123915,Still. If geoden worked try that first. A good shrink will know you and your story and move from there. It’s not a bad thing on meds. You can live a quality life like many around here do. It may be a little different but that isn’t something to worry about. Don’t suffer.

176123930,"I use niacin occassionally and it seems to help calm down my inner dialogue. I take 500mg every other or so. I tried taking one every day, but that gave me brain fog.

174373550,It is a Very Very difficult question because Clozapine is reserved for people who don’t respond so well on all the other antipsychotics. Clozapine works by blocking Dopamine 4 receptors and all other antipsychotics primary works by blocking Dopamine 2 receptors. You are not more I’ll than others if you are on Clozapine. You just have a schizophrenia that respond best to Clozapine.

If you not care about memory then you can try antidepressants. In supplement category mayoinositol works but be warned it will affect your working and short term memory. Benefits is it will greatly improve anxiety and thus if you have social anxiety, OCD, phobia etc it will be very useful. Another good supplement for OCD and general anxiety is NAC. It will not affect your memory much and only slightly and that too the effects vanish soon after you discontinue NAC. Another one and the best of all with least side effect is methylation agents like DMG, TMG, Methylfolate etc. DMG is best among these. If you are looking for a best combo supplement with least side effects for OCD then take DMG and NAC."

176123974,Meds can help make it easier to cope with or even make it go away sometimes. You have to take a stand and say they cannot hear me. Keep at it and develop that attitude and say to yourself when happens. Then you will be able to talk to people and act like it is not happening for real. You can have some freedom by meds and constant denying those thoughts.

176123979,Slept a while hoping it would help. It did a little.

176123984,"I’ve gotten to a medicine where I can lose weight on it. Please don’t quit cold turkey, it could be very dangerous. Please if you do want to quit talk to your doctor, they will help you, if you want to stop medication have them help you do it."
176123985,What is it?
176123986,"You guys don’t understand how much “blah” is impacting my life. I do nothing. As a wife, mom, home maker you cannot be that way. If anyone came in my house they’d be sickened. Its that bad."
176123987,"I also thought so, I believed that a girl drugged me to rape me. That girl then became my gf, I still thought that she’s trying to drug my coffee she made to steal and then kill me. Anyways, she left me bcz of my sz many years ago."
176123988,"Not a single soul, everyone was an enemy _USER_ID_: clarification"
176123989,"If you don’t mind me asking, how much do you believe in these voices? Is it real to you, or are you aware they aren’t real and just humour them?"
176123990,"Can you request accommodations from HR? You may need a letter from a pdoc but pdoc doesn’t have to disclose anything personal like diagnosis. Maybe you can get one for drawing during instructions so long as you continue to get good scores and perform well. Accommodations in writing will protect you from being singled out further. Workplaces can get in huge trouble for violating an _NAME_ accommodation. Just be aware that it may not be granted by the company. If you choose to try this route, I would go above any direct manager and straight to whoever does HR for your place of work. Being allowed to draw while listening is a reasonable accommodation imo and costs them absolutely $0 to do. Might be worth looking into. Otherwise, I would have to agree with the others:/ E: At least this is true in the US. Not sure about other places."
176123991,Love all your poems. Sorry you aren’t in the best space tho

176123997,The true art of conversation is listening. For staying friends with people it’s shared experience and knowing that person to a certain extent. It’s a skill and it can be learned so start small. Trying to know one person is a good start. What do they like? How do they like their coffee? Remembering little things cements bonds.
174373561,"I know from experience. Schizophrenia is not a medical disease like cancer. It is both psychological and biological, like just about any other mental illness. Why did she want you to do an IQ test? I’m sure it wasn’t just for fun. Aren’t you potentially wasting your intelligence when you cling to the hope that your solution will be presented to you some time in the future? A sizeable portion of people diagnosed with schizophrenia recover, and that portion seems to have been getting larger over the recent decades."
176123998,"I get followed when I drive. Sometimes I change the route I’m taking to lose them, and other times I try to ignore them. It’s pretty nerve racking though"
174373558,"I thought I was Jesus and that I won’t die if I commit suicide. I swallowed a whole Tylenol bottle, vomitted for 2hrs, my parents came home and forced me to go to the emergency. Dr in emergency told my parents that I would be dead from liver failure if they brought me late. They injected me with an antidote connected to a medical device to clean my liver. They said there is liver damage but it should repair itself, my liver blood tests are still abnormal since then, 10 years ago. They transferred me there to a psychiatrist, I told him that I am Jesus and he diagnosed me with schizophrenia. He accused me of trying to kill myself."
176123999,"thanks everyone for the positive feedback the idea was things i touch seemingly are destroyed, but also not as i initially thought. i didn’t want the flowers to be charred by the flowers because i want it to represent hope for me getting better. i added some more to the other side: image3024×4032 4.21 MB"

174373563,"I’m struggling with a lot of rude hallucinations right now. Just got done folding and putting away clothes; I even spruced up mine and bf’s room some. Even when I do my best to be “normal” and productive, there’s no peace. Near-constant belittling–if not over me failing to be an adult properly, then over minor ???? that would be ignored if anyone else did it or that hurts no one. Especially ???? about my lifelong balance issues or muscle control issues that lead to me banging into/banging things around. I swear, some of it is real–the sound quality seems too perfect to be hallucination… But because I’m a schizophrenic who hallucinates ???? talk or criticisms, I am terrified to call my bf and others around us out on any hateful behavior."
176124001,"I used to pace a lot on Invega, but now I barely move around. Might get 1000 steps tops."
176124002,In my case it didn’t.
176124003,Weed is an addictive substance that will only leave you with further down the rabbit hole. It does the opposite of bringing you closer to reality. Oh yeah feels good for an hour and then you realize you have only hurt yourself. Unless you want to be a ward of the state for eternity don’t touch it with a 10 foot pole.
176124004,What’s wrong with too much testosterone and would using the supplants be like steroids where it shrinks ur nuts and can’t produce test naturally?
176124005,"It is relating mathematics to esoteric philosophy, at least that’s my definition. I will be tutoring real mathematics such as you would find in A-Level or undergraduate, but presenting it in a way that relates to the inner world of perception."
176124006,"I can relate to this very strongly my family and friends often think I’m angry or drunk around them (the meds slur my speech and I often have a stupid little forced chuckle) I have roughish features and I’m very misunderstood by everyone I meet — I guess all I can say is practice smiling in the mirror and affirmation with that … Hope this helps Another thing - I can also relate awkward conversation and stale feelings, particularly around family … Forcing myself to speak should not be so hard - think of something humorous …"

176124008,"I found I lost my head when I got too much caffeine, so I simply switched to a good decaf brand that tastes just like caffeinated coffee. I feel that it still gives me a little boost."
176124009,"Mom’s 2nd surgery is today. Outpatient this time. I think she is managing SE better. Sent out 3 resumes and cover letters yesterday. Started answering phones at work. It SUCKS! I think with time and patience it’ll get easier and I’ll feel more comfortable. I pretty much have to put every caller on hold while i go ask someone else what to do and say. Its really uncomfortable for me and i have wicked phone anxiety. So far I’ve gotten pretty easy calls. Dr visit yesterday was good, A-ok."
176124010,I’ve now been officially psychosis free for a year and I’m back to a normal life but I can’t stop that voice in the back of my head that keeps saying I’m going to go nuts again and have to start over. It’s the one thing that has really been getting to me lately. Like how long do I need to go before I can be confident in my sanity?
176124011,I get the best workouts. I used to workout on risperdone. That SUCKED!!! Physical activity has become much easier since changing off of the risperdone.
176124012,"Last time I was this big it was because I was eating tons of chocolate covered granola bars all day. I merely cut those out and the ten pounds fell off. All I can think to do is stop eating seconds… I went from eating one fast food entree per visit to eating two, and from eating dinner by itself to dinner with a huge side of fries. Hopefully by cutting back to one entree and no sides (except maybe a salad) will do the same thing this time around."
176124013,"I was diagnosed schzioaffective and I was on invega and hospitalized twice. I get down kinda sad sometimes but maybe not major depression and no bipolar symptoms. I joke about hallucinations and such type symptoms due to anxiety about ex and see shadow and describe it as person . I kinda feel like people can guess what I’m thinking sometimes. In order to have schzioeffective you must have depression or bipolar symptoms which I did not. I have had psychosis often due anxiety ,sadness ,jobs,relationships but not full on psychosis. I’m now personality disorder with borderline and paranoid features ADHD. Was it wrong for me to be falsely labeled as schzioeffective and placed on invega in first place? Is schzioaffective more ""severe""than schzioaffective? Not to judge but I felt like I was given a harsher diagnosis with fair or not more judgement on my mental status based on that diagnosis."
176124014,I’ve read about such cases so can’t help but fear
176124015,I should call my psychiatrist But I still wanna know if i can handle it without more meds

176124027,I can’t figure out how to get out of bed in the morning. I feel like complete crap if I force myself to get up. It takes a few hours to get going. It doesn’t matter if I go to bed earlier. I sure would like the key to getting up and having at least a bit of energy.
176124028,"When I post here about matters that need hospital attention, I’m really looking for someone to push me to go to the hospital because I keep rationalizing not going. Sure, it’d be nice to talk about what’s bothering me, but none here are professionals"
176124029,"I’ve never taken medication, but I do wonder how much life I lost as a result. Many years are now blurred as I struggled with demons and suicidal ideation and self-harm. My life (I’m 52 now) has been one of subsistence. I do recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. That made a huge difference in my relationship to my hallucinations and perceptions… But, I would never tell someone they can recover without meds. I’m not recovered. I function better than some for sure, but the suffering, longing to escape, is always with me. I wonder what would’ve been different with meds and I encourage you to stick with something if it’s working."

176124039,Legalization is a safety issue now. So much of the black market stuff is boosted with fentanyl that you’re taking your life into your hands by buying from criminals. This is one of the reasons I support legalization.

Lorazepam belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines which act on the brain and nerves (central nervous system) to produce a calming effect. This drug works by enhancing the effects of a certain natural chemical in the body (GABA). Is lorazepam as strong as Xanax? Official Answer. Lorazepam and Xanax are both benzodiazepines used for the treatment of anxiety, and both are equally effective for this use. The main differences between Lorazepam and Xanax are: Xanax has a quicker onset of effect, but a shorter duration of action (4 to 6 hours) compared with lorazepam’s 8 hours."

176124101,"I was voted the mvp in football and basketball my senior year of high school as well as most athletic. I could’ve played d3 in college but decided not to. I had no love for football, which made me really good at it coincidentally. but I loved basketball, was the point guard and averaged about 10pts per game and 6 or 7 assists. also led the team in steals. basketball was my passion back then but d3 was lower than I was shooting for. in hindsight I wish I would have gotten a useless degree from one of the private liberal arts colleges that wanted me to play basketball, and gone on to become a high school history teacher and basketball coach."

176124110,I am thinking of signing up for a training program right now. It’s not a degree program but it’s four months of training. I will become a project management professional PMP and get a six sigma certification. It’s Monday through Thursday 5 pm to 9 pm for four months. I have 1 month and 13 days of GI Bill left so they are going to give me a scholarship for the rest. It won’t cost me anything. And for two months I will get an extra $1500 a month from the VA. The problem is I also work full time from 8 am to 430 pm Monday through Friday. So I will have a half an hour off from my 8 hour work day and then go to school for 4 hours. It’s all online and I work from home so I don’t have to leave my house. I have to figure out how to fit dinner and taking my meds in there somewhere. That’s very important. They also tweak your resume and offer you career placement services for the rest of your life. It’s only four months. Maybe I can do it. We shall see. It starts soon so I have to make a decis
ion fairly quickly. I hope to be able to get a higher paying job without having to move. I have done a lot of project and program management in my lifetime but I don’t have the certifications.

As soon as I heard about her condition, I texted my uncle to see if he would help me and he said yes right away. The thing is, I don’t know if he means just the flight or everything. How do I ask? I do have enough to buy food, but that is it. I don’t have anyone to stay with, and my family down there can’t drive to a funeral because their cars aren’t reliable. So how do I ask?

176124120,I get a lot of spam calls as well. I just don’t pick up if I don’t recognize the number and let it go to voicemail. Often they just hang up but sometimes they leave a long-winded message. What’s strange is that the majority of the time the voicemail is in what sounds like Chinese. I don’t even speak Chinese.
174373593,I just always feel a bit unsafe. I don’t know where I could feel safe. I think with my boyfriend but my family is trying to make me away from him. I don’t trust my family since I have that capgras symptom which I think in my case isn’t a symptom but a reality. I feel stupid for posting on schizophrenia forums since I really don’t believe I have it but my family believes it. I feel like I manipulated my family into thinking I have mental issues since I know when I was in college I didn’t feel like doing the work so feel like I used this mental issue as a way out. Then later after doing adderall I got severe symptoms but don’t know if that was actually caused by technology when I was a terrorist. I know most people here wouldn’t know about the technology under terrorism but I have many reasons to believe it is real. And most people here don’t think they’re terrorists.

176124124,"I think this is how Amycenone, the active compound in Amyloban, works: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effects of amycenone on serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-?, interleukin-10, and depression-like behavior in mice after lipopolysaccharide administration. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior , Sep 2015 Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression and that anti-inflammatory substances have antidepressant effects. Amycenone is obtained from extracts of the Yamabushitake (Hericium erinaceum). The purpose of this study is to examine whether amycenone shows anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects in an inflammation-induced mouse model of depression. First, we examined the effects of amycenone on the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), after intraperitoneal administration of th
e bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oral administration of amycenone (50, 100, or 200mg/kg) markedly blocked an increase in the serum TNF-? levels after a single administration of LPS (0.5mg/kg). Furthermore, amycenone (200mg/kg) markedly increased the serum IL-10 levels by a single administration of LPS (0.5mg/kg). Next, we examined the effects of amycenone on depression-like behaviors in the tail-suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Pretreatment with amycenone (200mg/kg) significantly attenuated LPS (0.5mg/kg)-induced increase of the immobility time by the TST and FST, indicating antidepressant effects of amycenone. In addition, oral administration of paroxetine (30mg/kg) showed anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects in the same model. These findings suggest that amycenone has antidepressant effects in LPS-induced inflammation model of depression. Therefore, amycenone could represent a potential supplement to prevent inflammation-related depression. Basically, it suppresse
s pro-inflammatory compounds and expresses anti-inflammatory compounds. Controls brain inflammation!"

174373591,"The DSM-V renames schizophrenia as “salience syndrome”. Salience is the state of noticing something, within the environment or within your mind. Salience syndrome is noticing too many things. Your brain is on overdrive noticing too many sensory inputs and trying to weave together a narrative that makes sense of it all. That narrative is always an insane one, for schizophrenics. Like, the typical schizophrenic will hear inane creaks and cracks in the walls from heat expansion / cold contraction and put some divine meaning to it, because they seem to match some of his thoughts, like that is God’s way of communicating with him. They also put way too much weight on meaningless events like a stranger coughing or sneezing, and even stranger conversations. In a sane world, those events are 100% unrelated to you, unless you were like _NAME_ famous and people talk about you everywhere . But then they would talk about you in direct terms, not in some kind of cypher that your overactive brain tries to c
rack."

176124267,"Hyper focus is the reason. When a doubt or other important thought (it depends on type of OCD like dirt in contamination, counting, checking, thought of harming others, sexual doubt, urge etc anything which the user feel like important to them) comes to mind. The mind focuses on it hard or deep and during that time all other thoughts are put in background and thus mind make that thought so important and it keeps playing in mind. Now this is how intrusive thoughts are formed. In individuals who have no OCD that thought not able to become intrusive thought as they quickly discard it or they not hyper focus on it. Social anxiety is also a kind of OCD here the individual gets thoughts like what others think of me, get too much involved about how people react etc. These kind of thoughts become intrusive thoughts for such individuals. The mechanism how SSRI works for OCD, social anxiety is like this. These drugs numbs the mind making it hard to hyperfocus on anything. This way those thoughts unable to be
come intrusive thoughts. In social anxiety too, the individual find it hard to think the negative thoughts in depth like before."
174373615,No. Being controlling is not a symptom of schizophrenia. It’s a personality trait that you need to go to therapy and learn how to get under control. And you NEED to take personal responsibility for hurting others. This is not your illness making you hurt people. It’s you hurting people and then using your illness as an excuse to never get better. Therapy can help. CBT can help. But you need to understand that YOU are causing the problems in your life.

176124300,I’m confused whether I’m sza or not. In my younger years I feel like I did things for attention even though I was mildly paranoid about things I think majority of people would not be. Now I’m stuck wondering whether my sister died and someone took her body out of the house and replaced her with her clone. It just seems to me to be something a sz or other person would think. So I try to tell myself that and that is why a part of me thinks I’m delusional. But because of how weird my boyfriend is I start to think it is real. My boyfriend wants me to get a capacity evaluation to prove I’m fine. And if I test fine then does that mean all the things I’m scared of will come true? Because I felt I would be captured before and the danger I felt felt so real. But this seems to be a common sz or related fear. I just really don’t know. Especially because I feel like I was attention seeking before

176124378,That’s so hard to go through. I’ve felt like that before. Can you call your family and talk for a while? Maybe it’ll help a bit.

176124381,Haha im not judging
176124382,The problem your _PERSON_ will have is that she could potentially get in trouble. Even if its just a bad credit rating for taking products and charging back for no reason. But its not really something you can control. Especially as its already happened. I don’t see how you will go to jail. I would stop worrying about that.
176124383,"All i can say is it is up to each person to fix themselves as best they can in or before a relationship, it’s not okay to expect everyone we date to conform to all our beliefs Most people masturbate, my x wife did and so did I and it can be made a fun thing to do in front of each other, The point being is couples discuss what goes on in their homes and I think in this case expressing to him calmly you don’t like that sort of thing and prefer he do it when your not around would have been the way to go"

176124386,"I had a breakthrough late yesterday (I can’t detail it or I will get flagged) and the urges have finally passed. I am back to feeling satisfied with my food again. Binging is an important issue for me because I was bulimic for ten years when I was younger. I don’t want to get back into old patterns. I don’t even want to binge, so purging won’t be an issue. Bulimia to me is just like I perceive substance abuse disorders in others - you’re always in recovery but never cured."

176124391,What do you mean by saying that? What delusion do I have? Please tell me…
176124392,Watching my brothers raise their kids and grandkids Spending a Friday and Saturday night not going anywhere with the knowledge that I never did. Watching people driving cars. Commercials on TV Looking at my wallet. Looking at how small my room is. Noticing how little in my room was bought by me Trying to remember the last time that the money I had was actually earned by me. Trying to relate when guys talk of their significant others.

176124396,oh ill physically or mentally? im just curious. ive been on it about two years and im still questioning whether my year of hellish instability that i had 2020 was fully due to klonopin withdrawal or if the paliperidone is not as effective as it should be. i see alot of people say it doesnt work for them like risperidone does
176124397,I want to believe in ghosts. But I don’t. I’m just happy to get hallucinations of my son once in awhile.
176124398,They told me I needed one to post on here and everybody else had one.
176124399,Routine is good. You’ve probably heard me harp on about it a bit as I know you know my stuff. It’s hard for sure but some sort of routine is good. No dramas if your a night owl. The early mornings are just as quiet etc. Just find the routine that works for you and try to do the same things every day for a while. Especially when it comes to taking your pills… I think structure is so good for the sz peeps. It gives you stability in a realm of things that aren’t stable so you have at least a fall back position. If that makes some sense. Start tomorrow because it’s hard to change overnight. You really have to be committed for a while…

176124403,"You shouldn’t consume grapefruit if you’re on certain prescription meds. There should be a statement to that effect somewhere on the med bottle, I would hope. For example, I’m on a cholesterol lowering drug, simvastatin, and it states on the bottle: “Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice at any time while taking this medication.”"
176124404,Sounds like you need a med adjustment
176124405,"Well don’t worry about the first appointment. You will spend it giving a history. And then you most likely will discuss what type of therapy they give and what suits you situation best and plan your sessions. So after your first visit you should have an idea of what you’re going to be working on a what you’re going to be talking about loosely. I think it’s great you’re doing this, therapy is so helpful when you’re ready to put some work into it. It can give you tools for coping, skills for dealing, closure for the past, clarity for the present situation. It’s great. I wish you the best."
174373643,"Sometimes you have to force yourself to be happy, like think of something good that has happened that day. Being optimistic is super helpful."

174373639,The only way you can feel happy at work is if you are confident. Lack of confidence only causes worry and stress. You would not be ahead of the game at all. I say go ahead and collect disability if you are unsure of yourself.
174373637,"It took several months before I got clarity on my delusion, and even then its only recently that It’s felt less “sacred” and close to my identity and such. Its just a set of ideas I had, about an experience I had, and that’s that. Nothing ground breaking world revolutionizing. If you take medicine there’s a good chance that in a few months you too will gain clarity."

176124414,"I’m not fond of cocaine use any more than I am of cannabis. My mother did cocaine growing up, and I hated it. I used to have childhood friends ask if I lived in a trap house. We used to have police officers go by very slowly past our house. I felt as though we were the well known drug house of the neighborhood, and I loathed feeling that way."

176124418,"I never said it wasn’t, but saying that sz and szas aren’t violent is like saying normies aren’t. Like _PERSON_, pop over to the family forum and read about how they have been hurt by their low functioning loved ones. I never said there was a high risk, just that it happens. And it is often due to hallucinations, psychosis, or delusional thinking. There are dangerous sz and sza just like there are dangerous normies, dangerous bipolar, dangerous anything. We can’t pretend that a lot of szs aren’t scary. Yelling at nothing, striking out at nothing, accusing people of doing things they aren’t, smashing electronics or other items, that can be scary to people. Enough people do this stuff to make us all look scary. That’s all I am saying. I never said it’s right, only expected. Negative things stick in minds more than positive for some reason."

I’m in my mid-40’s and my fitness built up quite quickly (though I was quite fit from hiking) and now I can walk/jog about 5-8km each morning. Mentally, I feel awful the whole time I’m exercising. My pdoc said I’d get endorphins & feel good but I never do. I just do the exercise anyway, regardless of my psychotic symptoms raging away the whole time. Don’t let the voices stop you, it’s always beneficial for your health to do healthy exercise. My mental health has not improved at all with my fitness but my physical health does.

People actually took these things very seriously, and even British scientists were involved in this. The Nazi’s were the extreme version and took it into action.

174373670,"Yeah, very unfortunately, in schizophrenia relapses happen. It could happen to almost anyone, even if they’re taking medication as prescribed. Stopping the drinking is an important good step and as someone mentioned, if you are smoking weed or doing other street drugs it’s important to stop those too. Two common causes of relapse is stress and stopping medication. But as someone mentioned, you may need a doctor to adjust your meds and a new or different medication may be in the cards for you. You just might have too much on your plate in your life. You may be attempting to do too much and it’s catching up to you. After 40 years with schizophrenia I try to do as much as I can and even though I’ve gone through periods where I feel relatively OK and I’m functioning very highly I know I can’t “have it all” there’s just things I can’t do because of my disease. I know how frustrating it is to be high functioning and then go downhill and after all this time I learned I have to make com
promises and sacrifices in order to do what I’m doing. I know it’s difficult to look around at your friends or roommates or family and see them doing stuff you can’t do because of your illness. It’s frustrating also to feel equal and “as good as” your friends but then you find you aren’t able to keep up anymore. But that’s how the disease works sometimes. I’m not saying to give up, but you might have to take it easy and drop some stressful things that you are used to doing. Because you can be the most high functioning schizophrenic in the world but once you have schizophrenia it is going to affect you in some way, shape or form. That’s why you may have to make sacrifices and maybe dial back your activities. I can tell you a little of my experience with schizophrenia from just a couple years ago. I function OK; I’ve been working for almost 35 years at various jobs (mostly part-time), I lived independently for almost twenty years, I’ve been driving since 1996, I take online college cours
es. I’m 59 by the way, diagnosed in 1980. I stayed out of the hospital from 1990 to 2015. 25 years. I had a relapse in 2015. I got suicidal when my mom died and ended up in the psyche ward. A bunch of bad crap happen in my life and I’m still working, driving. taking classes and living semi-independently. But just three years ago when I moved into this apartment I was given a very bad roommate. He didn’t clean, he drank and did drugs, borrowed money and just generally was a bad roommate. He was homeless and violent in his youth but it turns out a counselor told me lied a lot about his past and after he moved out I compared notes with the counselor and we figured out he lied about a lot of the stuff he told me. Just a bad guy. We lived in this apartment for a year and he found such rotten ways to bug me and caused me so much stress that I literally began to have a serious relapse. I didn’t know how to deal with it, I felt helpless over the escalating relapse. I tried to stave it off. Well, that guy fina
lly moved out and incidentally, mental illness or not, I figured out what a liar and loser he was after he moved out. But the good news is that within a month of him moving out my relapse stopped, the symptoms receded and I got back to normal. This whole paragraph is to show what stress can do to a schizophrenic, whether the stressor is s person, place or thing or situation. Once the stress is gone whether it’s a terrible roommate, too many classes, working too many hours at work, hanging around the wrong people or going to the wrong places, doing drugs or drinking etc. Once you get rid of some of that stress you may avoid a serious relapse or maybe make it much less serious. _PERSON_ know what else to tell you, this is my experiences after having schizophrenia so long. Don’t worry about calling your psychiatrist. Call him. You ain’t going to hurt him by calling him, he knew stuff like this would happen when he got into the psychiatry field and he knew what he was getting into when he took the job. He g
ets paid to help and that includes dealing and helping his patients when they are going through a crisis. Welcome to the forums, I hope you got something from all this.

What he is asking for is access to all finances and share everything. Am I wrong for wanting trust and transparency? And he blames my paranoia as to why he won’t give me trust and transparency although it is a factor but I still want transparency. Should I give in despite my paranoia or should I be persistent with wanting trust and transparency to ease my paranoia.

Published: July 8, 2019 8:58 a.m. ET The trial, which evaluated 554 patients with bipolar disorder in the U.S., showed that lumateperone was no better than a placebo in helping to relieve symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder. However, Intra-Cellular also announced positive results in a separate global trial of the drug looking at 381 patients with bipolar disorder from around the world. This Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint; after six weeks of treatment, patients on the drug showed statistically-significant improvement over those on placebo. Intra-Cellular is also conducting a third trial of the drug, looking at it as an adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate. In early July, _PERSON_ of Cowen said Intra-Cellular would need two 
positive trials to support filing a new drug application, or NDA. If both the U.S. and global trials looking at lumateperone showed positive results, the company would be able to file an NDA sometime in the second half of 2019, she wrote in a note to clients last week. But if only one of the trials was positive, the company would have to wait for data from the third trial – evaluating lumateperone as an adjunctive therapy – to come out. That data won’t be available until 2020 So next year we might know if Lumateperone is effective for bipolar."

If we can’t feel good through the process of losing weight, it just seems to come back. It’s a pattern that takes time to break. I’m also having trouble with routine and sticking to anything because of erratic sleeping patterns. But this morning I actually woke up to my alarm. And I’ve been sticking to going for a walk/jog around night a few hours before winding down. I think it just takes a long time to really get into a routine that will feel good. But if we feel stress it makes it harder to lose weight! It’s so awesome right? Lol. That’s the worst part of the cycle of it is the stress. Because you know it makes it hard and can cause more weight gain, but you can’t help but stress when you gain weight! ARG"

176124685,"Been studying for my psych course in nursing and reading about different models for mental health and one is the recovery model, which focuses on basically giving people with mental illness the best possible lives. Making sure symptoms are at a minimum and functioning is high and people have their lives back. And I realized that in my experience most prescribers do not follow this at all. The main goal of prescribers does not seem to be recovery, but rather to get their patient on a medication and then keep them on that medication. I have seen way too many situations and been in way too many situations where the person is suffering from side effects from meds that only kind of or barely or not at all help with symptoms. They tell their prescribers this and the prescribers brush them off or raise the dose. If prescribers were truly recovery focused they would be listening to their patient and constantly adjusting to find what medications worked best for the patient. Instead I found that this ended u

176124755,It’s not. You’ve a disorder which makes things seem more than they are. It’s common to feel guilty. It really is but with meds you can move forward from there. It’s simple genetics. Environmental trigger hits some latent biology. Your not responsible for what happens to others and if your mind is saying so it’s not uncommon. Don’t do anything stupid. Get stable on some meds or talk to your doctor. I’ve been there myself and it soon passes!

174373724,"My psychiatrist said partial dopamine agonists like Abilify, Rexulti and Vraylar cause less negative symptoms than all other antipsychotics which are full dopamine antagonists."
174373726,"While I haven’t achieved anything in this life and probably won’t (the odds are against me significantly), I hope to. I want to make $100k a year before taxes and marry a blonde woman and have kids… I want to lose weight, increase my hygiene skills, and get a degree. I usually don’t achieve anything with my life. I suffered a terrible fate. But I believe in past lives and no kind of medication will change my belief system. I even had people or perhaps aliens tell me I really don’t have schizophrenia. But if I don’t, why don’t I have any motivation? Why can’t I brush my teeth anymore or shower regularly? I doubt I have just bipolar or even schizotypal aspergers. I doubt a lot of things. Even at my worst, I never heard voices or hallucinated. I just had severe depression, dissociation, and negative symptoms brought on by risperdal and other APs. Vraylar is great in that it works with my body chemistry. I am a former computer simulator in another life. Probably a former ET not by choic
e. I was born human. Don’t think you can achieve anything higher than that in life. There is a rank and I’m at the bottom but so what? I had a great life once. I’ve seen the Riemann Hypothesis for example. _NAME_ couldn’t even do that. I’m not a narcissist just telling you my story. I’ve been through some terrible, ?????? up ????. Even traveled through time. It’s a blessing and a curse that no one believes me. If they did, I think I would get scared or even freak out. I have a soft spot for schizophrenics. And yes I do have a diagnosis. Just because I believe we are in the matrix shouldn’t automatically qualify you for a paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis. I will never go back to a Christian mental hospital again, especially after they almost killed me with over-medication and from NMS."

176124825,My dad when I was 5 or 6 left the state to get work. While he was gone my mom had at least 2 boyfriends and maybe a 3rd. So yeah she was sleeping with men behind my dad’s back. She went motorcycle riding with a guy that we were living with and left me alone 5 years old in this guy’s house. He had 2 teen boys who both messed with me. I learned from an early age that a woman’s value to a man depends on if she can please him sexually. That I learned from my dad. At least that’s the vibe he put off and that hurt me badly. I hated men for years. At the time of her death though my mother was a true blue Christian and my dad is too now. I’ve seen him looking at women the way he used to but he doesn’t treat them like he used to.
176124826,"oh, is it a regular course…I thought it was online."
176124827,Yeah I don’t know if I’m schizophrenic. Should I listen to my current psychiatrist? She is a respected professional who has multiple years studying and researching severe mental illnesses. Or should I listen to my current therapist who diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder?

But I’ve learned a life lesson from raising these pigs. They don’t care what they look like and they don’t care if they’re fat. I’m sure your mom shaming you doesn’t help. APs are notorious for putting weight on folk. My dad used to make fun of fat women when I was growing up. That contributed to my eating disorders. I grew out of them though. I mean I binge at night but I haven’t been bulimic or anorexic in more than 20 years. I know I was addicted to purging at one time and it was just awful . Try not to do it. I think _AT_MENTION_ may have some info on an eating disorder hotline. I’m waiting on my doctor to refer me for my binging.

176124841,You can try to teach English on line to people in Asia. There’s a market for it but it’s obviously better pay if you actually go there. In China there is a place that even covers your room and board. I forget the name of the company. They wanted to interview me once.
176124842,yeah probably due to adrenaline
176124843,I am glad that you feel better. Zyprexa is a good med. Hope you don’t gain weight on it. This company is producing new med with less weight gain. It is in phrase 3. Hope it will be out in the market soon.
176124844,She looks Asian.
176124845,I’m so glad I never smoked.
174373741,I don’t actually know what abilify does to me. I don’t even take it regularly. Sometimes I’ll go two week without having touched it. That’s pretty normal. There’s no routine to my medication taking. I’d probably be more good with the medication and just well-being wise if I did take it regularly as instructed as it is meant to be a mood stabiliser.

174373734,"So how it goes? The sz is not just about hearing voices, Delusion and paranoia and negative symptoms need care too, and an AD may help with negative symptoms but not with delusions and paranoia, sometimes AD makes things like paranoia and delusions even worse and can be the cause of your dettachment from reality, To be sure that I’m wrong, check it with another psychiatrist,"

176124853,"People don’t hate you. Sure there might be a few shallow people, but most people aren’t. A lot of people have disablities and everyone has it difficult from time to time. Just about everyone at least has short term mental issues like depression or anger. Just because most people don’t have the same diagnosis you have they have no reason to hate you. A lot of people can relate to mental issues. Just because the doctor put a label on you doesen’t mean that people dislike you. The mental illness umbrella is huge. People can have psychosis, be bipolar, have long term depression and a host of other mental illnesses. I’m pretty sure there are probably like 50% of people who have or have had some sort of psychiatric disease, so it makes no sense to think that others hate you for it. You have to try to reconcile with people. Don’t think of other people as a whole, but that you are dealing with different individuals who have different histories, views, opinions and ways of viewing the world. The 
first step is to stop judging people collectively. Start thinking of every single person as someone who is unique in their qualities and the ways they relate to other people."
176124854,That’s so sad. I really hope the nursing home I used to work at doesn’t get effected
176124855,Into obsessing about everything. I know when we are psychotic it just happens everywhere. But what about when we are out of psychosis. Is there some meaning behind coincidences if they happen or is it just a random sort of thing? I really don’t want to fall into the trap of obsessing over coincidences if they happen because it can be time consuming of my mental energy. Perhaps even exhausting.

I think brainvitaminz ran out or something. I prefer sodium benzoate, but I stopped all supplements. I was worried about the interactions. I just take vitamin D now because I’m low and the doctor recommended it. Sodium benzoate was much stronger, but it wore off over time. Diminishing returns or something.

I mean what else could you’ve done differently when you were a child. There is no way you could’ve protected yourself as a child against grown adult. If anything people around you would’ve protected you if they knew what’s happening. But you were a child, small and helpless to change anything. So don’t blame yourself for anything."
174373746,That’s what I’m hoping for. I’m on my second shot just a week ago
176124872,Yes which is why it’s a delusion. It’s faulty wiring in the brain. It isn’t mystical or magical. Investigate the medications is a tip. They do improve it for a lot of people and it sounds very much like sz or psychosis.

I wrote to Dr. _PERSON_ enquiring if there was any similar research being done near me and how could I get involved, but she never responded, it was over Christmas so probably a bad time. Anyway, the video is interesting, though the lecture is full of a lot of filler material and the conclusions could be stated in a few seconds, the brief interlude on wave spectral analysis is interesting as well. Thank you."

I guess i felt like a lesser god. I have a religion. It benefits me because the reptilians and greys kept attacking and possessing me. Perhaps God sent me a message around August 27th 2011. He said he put me in the matrix. I tried waking people up.

I’m left with residual whispers though but the main incapacitating psychosis has gone tg. My pdoc agrees with the totals of the thread in that it’s harder to treat the longer you leave it."

I want to take another SSRI but I’m fed up trying them as I start feeling like crying or sometimes I actually cry. My pdoc theory is that I quit SSRI too soon for it to work. He told me to take low dose benzo along with SSRI. But i have to take really high benzo like clobazam 20mg for me to tolerate SSRI. But if i reduce my benzo i start crying again. And high dose benzo causes severe sedation. I dont know what to do.

176124930,"I’ve been where you are, _NAME_. Sometimes I would drink over a thirty cans of American beer in a day when I was drinking heavily. (I think Irish beer is quite a bit stronger than American beer.) It’s such a relief not to wake up after a hard drunk and have someone tell me all the crazy things I did the night before. Mixing alcohol with our med’s is terrible for our bodies. It’s been four years since I last drank. I’m glad it is over."
176124931,"There is little difference to children of both genders crying in early development. What changes for male children is that they reach the age of 5 or 6 and then little boys are conditioned not to cry, mostly by their parents. Here lies the fundamentals of social pressure for males not to cry as it is pressured throughout school and upwards. Both, male and female humans have tear glands designed specifically for this purpose, the only difference is that boys were told not to cry, whereas females generally don’t have the same pressure. If you feel the desire and pain to cry then by all means don’t feel the pressure of countless generations boys to conceal it or the shame associated with it. It is a release of emotion and pressure in itself. Go for it!"

It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I feel things were much simpler when I had no idea what was happening to me. The appeal of the danger created by being psychotic I want right now is pretty much to escape from all this.

176124959,"I am happier when I don’t hear voices. If you want to reduce voices via diet, the amino acid to avoid is tryptophan, since that ups kynurenic acid production, which antagonises NMDA and causes hallucinations. Niacin will reduce the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenic acid via the production of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, an enzyme that slants tryptophan metabolism away from kynurenic acid towards more useful metabolites. The most liver-safe, non-flushing kind of Niacin is Inositol Hexanicotinate."

176124962,It’s like a nightmare that ends only when properly medicated. Then my memory of psychosis is all fuzzy and I feel like I’ve lost track of time.
176124963,I’m so sorry _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_.
176124964,One thing I realized about paranoia is that you have to be pretty important for people to be out to get you. Being unremarkable and insignificant hurts.
176124965,"_AT_MENTION_ there was a study my friend told me about, where they tracked the frequencies that are above and below human hearing. When grass was cut, there was a distinct reading in the frequencies above our earshot. In short, the grass was screaming. Native peoples always said a prayer of thanks when they cut down a tree, or harvested anything for food. I think they knew and saw things more clearly than we do in our Modern Age"

176124969,"Hi everyone. I am not unwell. These things are actually happening and it frustrating for me when they’re like oh it’s your mind playing tricks dont you think you have scizophrenia. No. My car, the police all are intertwined. I did something bad and now I’m getting threats indirectly from the police through my car. Its freaking me out. It all started in 2015. I had a good life. I had some extra assistance from an elderly woman which started ok. Then she decided to gather my community together to follow Harras and do street theater etc. Also poison my food.i didnt enter my kitchen for 10 weeks and my dad came down to see me and said there were maggots everywhere. Then there was my first car.we had this special relationships which no one seems to understand.it was talking to me and I obeyed its rules. I got into trouble with the police a bit and soon after 2016 realized they had taken a body part from. Then my next car tried to gas me like the jews. I had a break down 200km away they had to tran
sfer me back to the hospital but dam that car was evil. My dad took it to the wreckers despite it not wanting to die. The hospital staff morphed and it was frightening. Again it was run by the police and the electromagnetic waves through their 3 aerials. This new car. Whoa. It is manipulating and black maioing to tell bad stuff on the radio and news if I dont drive it and if I have no petrol steal some. I’m hardly a thief. It had a large aerial which I didnt know when I bought it. Crap!"
176124970,What medication and supplements do you take for panic and anxiety attacks? Right now I am taking a prn Clonazepam. My panic attacks are pretty intense and my prn not always helps.

We did only this. And my soul and body and mind never recovered from those meds… maybe I should have believed more in the meds in order so they could help… but now I am tired to try new ones etc. Who else got better in fact by his efforts, pal?

176125005,"It dawned on me one day. In 1980 I was 19 and I went into my first psyche ward. I was there a week but left there feeling 50 times worse than when I entered. Next stop was Soteria House, a world famous, experimental house for schizophrenics. Their tenet was that they claimed they could help schizophrenics better without hospitalization or meds. There were a few of these houses around the world in certain countries. They closed down in about 1984 for lack of funding. For staff, Soteria hired a bunch of young, friendly, open-minded, likable, intelligent people who had no formal training in the psychiatric field. They were there to sit and mingle with us clients and just listen to anything we wanted to say. It was a nice, old, two story house. Pretty much any behavior was tolerated but no violence or drugs. I saw some pretty weird stuff there for the year I lived there and pretty strange people. I was so naïve when I first got there. After I had been there about a week I learned an older client had s
erved time in prison. I flipped out and told a counselor and I was indignant that they let this guy live there. I thought the guy was dangerous and I think I even told staff to kick him out, lol. I calmed down and over the course of the few following weeks I saw the guy was harmless and didn’t start any trouble and then I grew up a little when a few other guys moved in who had been in jail and even one guy who had been in Vietnam. Anyways, I had been there about three or four months and I thought nothing was wrong with me. In fact I thought I was perfect. I also thought I was a genius. I was feeling like this but one day, my parents took me to a psychiatrist. He was actually from our church. Me, my dad and my mom drove to his office and met with him. I thought it went well. The psychiatrist wanted to talk to me without my parents so my parents went outside. The psychiatrist told me my parents were very worried about me. I remember telling him, “There’s nothing wrong with me, they were the ones who had t
he problem.” I sincerely believed this. The meeting ended and my parents drove me back to Soteria. But actually I think meeting with the shrink had put just a little doubt in me that maybe I wasn’t as well as I thought I was. Here I was living with 7 schizophrenics, suffering and barely hanging on to sanity and i thought I was fine. After a month or so it just popped into my head that maybe I was wrong and everybody else was right when it came to my mental health. This is how I got insight that I was truly ill."
176125006,ah that’s good news that they refill your meds. Hopefully the new pdoc will be nice too.
176125007,they show up in the first page of my typing in my sisters name and she knows I have schizophrenia so she’s trying to make me think I have delusions of reference. but the article is too similar to life events

174373792,"I had a psychotic episode 10 years ago. They then thought that might be sz. But because of the nature of the illness they ruled it out few months back. The pdoc I saw said one episode of psychosis is not enough to say I have schizophrenia. And about the bipolar, he has not completely gotten rid of the diagnosis yet. But he feels that if the anxiety is controlled so will the mood swings… When I got the schizophrenia diagnosis, I had a feeling something else was going on and I thought that because my moods were effected, I thought it was bipolar so I’d create a list of sympotms I thought I had that matched bipolar … I have never ever been in hospital so they’ve never seen me in any manic state or depressive state. They’ve only ever seen a psychsis, once, 10 years ago."
176125012,"I get akathisia from olanzapine after I take it at night. If I take it some hours before bed then the akathisia sets in, but if I take it just before bed I don’t get it. What helps for me is to get on my exercise bike and cycle till my legs tired. Then I can sleep well."

Have been on 5mg abilify daily and cogentin for about a few years now with no voices and no hallucinations. 3 weeks ago, I forgot to take medications for 3 days. Suddenly gone into a “relapse” with positive and negative symptoms like hallucinations, paranoia, grandiose, anxiety, voices, and smelling things that my family says is not there (i.e., smelling gas, but my family says that there is no gas leak anywhere!!) … Even though I have been consistent with meds for the past 2.5 weeks , I still cannot differentiate from what is real and what is not real… How long does it take for abilify 5mg to work to make the voices go away? Going to see my mental health center to see my psych doc in a few days. Do you think increase of 10mg abilify would make these negative and positive symptoms go away? Or will I have to ask my doc for another med?"

174373796,"_AT_MENTION_ The Zyprexa reduces my appetite for some reason, rather than stimulating it. The only time I get hungry is right before my menstrual cycle, then I am just under my 1400 calorie max because I refuse to go over it and gain weight. For example, two days ago, I was at 1391 calories. Still in my range but barely. I went to 1800 calories one day since I started restricting, and I gained a pound that fast. Zyprexa is relentless wanting to put weight on you, so I have to be meticulous. Good for you for losing 75 pounds! I had lost about that much a few years ago, and then when I went on Geodon and then Abilify, I gained it all back plus another 20 pounds. I am losing weight now that I had already lost before. I am determined to reach my weight loss goals now though, even on a drug like Zyprexa that normally makes people gain. Zyprexa has been my miracle drug, so I am not going off it."

I remember asking the neurology instructor that after class. The doctor just smiled and told me, you tell me. Im inclined to say, yes, essentially, in its elemental form, but there is much more to it than that. If you ask a charmin, a philosopher, an athiest, a doctor, a child or the mentally ill you will get a different answer.

I’ve been on Aristada, and I currently receive shots of Abilify Maintena. Both are/were good drugs for me. I had been on Abilify tablets, but then my psychiatrist was no longer able to get them for me for free (no insurance). Abilify/aripiprazole has been the best AP for me. It’s effective, and I have experienced minimal side effects. It killed my sex drive for a while, that was the main side effect, but that has come back to me now, so yeah, currently experiencing no noticeable side effects. I have to take Haldol tablets in addition to the shots, but that’s typical for me; my system requires a lot of medication to control symptoms. I hope it works as well for you as it has for me!"

176125086,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_
176125087,I don’t know if its quarintine or what but I’m always annoyed and angry. I also stopped doing a couple things that were helping me fill my days but don’t interest me much lately. So I just sit around bored a lot and my family seems to annoy me now more than ever.
176125088,"5mg probably wouldn’t have done it for me, I’m on 20. Voices and delusions drastically lesser now. 5mg is more of a non therapeutic dose for sz, that’s more the dose for depression. Tell doc you’re still hearing voices. Ask about a therapeutic dose."

176125090,"Ugh I don’t know where to begin and mods I apologize if this is too graphic please just remove it I just don’t know where else to turn. So this morning I had a crazy graphic sex dream about having oral sex with multiple men and having to swallow a ton of semen. This was very triggering for me because when I was 12 I was forced to give oral sex to my friends uncle and it ultimately was a very traumatic experience. Anyway in this dream I remember I really wanted to have sex with the guys but they wouldn’t have sex with me until I had given them oral sex. None of this makes sense to me because I don’t typically even like guys sexually, let alone want to give them oral sex?! I was wondering if maybe the dream I had was because I’m feeling sexually repressed in some way or another? I don’t know. I just needed to get this out there. Why does my brain want to torture me so badly?"
176125091,Mate I wish I could! Alls I know is that ups turns up at my place it’s time for joy because I’m getting stuff I bought online shopping! It doesn’t mean anything special or added …thus the concern. How you feeling matey?

174373800,"interesting. i havent read it but perhaps it has to do with depression. IMO mental illnesses are connected, and prolonged depression caused by hypothyroidism might be a potential trigger, i think, for phychosis…prolonged over months youd be DX schizophrenic. May be the case for some people. Addressing underlying thyroid issues could be helpful for some."

176125099,I woke up early today and didn’t snooze.
174373803,"Well kind of. When you cite studies or statistics you have to consider the source. Most things I read from different sources seem to back up my claim. Three factors that make the chances of getting violent go up in schizophrenics are not talking medication, a history of violence before getting sick and substance abuse. That’s a generalization that makes it sound like all schizophrenics are dangerous. That’s simply not true. Me and friends I’ve had who are schizophrenic never got violent and manage our emotions just fine. I’m not dangerous to myself and others, and my delusions do not stop me from working, taking college courses, living semi-independently, driving my own car, getting up and going grocery shopping this morning and now eating a leisurely breakfast as I talk to you."
176125100,"It wasn’t that weird, it was actually good advice but when I try to tell people I get weird reactions. I had a therapist who used to tell me to have fun and do something fun. In fact, his whole therapeutic approach was based on getting his clients to do fun things. He told me that he used to see the biggest problem with his clients is that (and I do this too for periods of time) they concentrate and spend so much time focusing on their problems that they just never have fun. And he observed that this can be detrimental to their recovery. He tried to get his clients to go to a movie or go play frisbee in the park or go window shopping downtown or go to a free outdoor concert or a museum or art gallery or go bowling. The therapist was an ex-marine and a recovering alcoholic with ten years clean at the time; so he was pretty cool and had been around the block a few times. That was over twenty years ago but I still remember his advice now and then. The only reason I write this is because you don’t 
have a lot of therapists who encourage people so strongly to have fun."

176125118,"I have been on Amisulpride for two years. Not sure, but I think the anxiety was triggered long ago, but it was only treated in the last year. Mistakenly I have been hospitalised because of it as it really put me in a state, and I never told any of the mental health workers what was wrong, they just saw me suffering. My now retired pdoc of 16 years finally got me to open up a bit, and now I take Pregabalin and Diazepam for my anxiety. Not sure if the Amisulpride causes this, but I will add to the list as I am on the phone with the pharmacist on Thursday to discuss my medications in more detail"

176125121,"I got divorced because my wife was a thief and sociopath. She also was abusive towards me and cheated many times. By the way when I became aware of the truth, she initiated the divorce."
176125122,I was submissive something horrid before medication and psychosis. I tried not to be but I was always a push over. I put up a fight sometimes but I never won. I don’t want to obey anyone and I don’t believe I should have superiors yet I know I’m a pushover and I seem to be submissive even when I’m trying to be some kind of a anarchist in a way. I believe Army like hierarchy n stuff suits most people but not me sure society is like that but I should not be a part of that I should be excepted from that outside of that excused from that. My x in sa is a captain in fire brigade and loves army and hierarchy etc but that’s great for him but I do t want part in it . I want to be outside of society in that regard. I left my x in sa because I didn’t want to be a obedient meat eater n for the animals even though I love him most. I was pretty submissive and suppressed before psychosis unfortunately. I can’t stand people bossing me about it talking down at me thinking they are superior to me. Can
t stand it . I leave people and situations where I feel they are trying to suppress me and dominate me etc If they forse me to stay I suffer until I can find a way to leave. I have issues with this submissive thing. I don’t want to be submissive to anyone.ever. I was submissive to my x in sa as he is the best leader but that was by my will and if I choose to do what my favourite man tells me by will then that’s not submissive so bad but when I disagreed with him I “disobeyed” and left for the animals and environment and my morals regarding this. I have learnt to say no sometimes but not all the time.depends on the person and how uncomfortable I feel with them etc
176125123,"Yes, I do have symptoms. I am half crazy to cope in this world. The psychotic episodes are to real to be fake. Yesterday someone told me I am a smart cookie what makes it all worse. I don’t do hatespeeches anymore. I got my anger in control. The thoughtpolice is on my case."
176125124,I took all personal information off.
176125125,"If you won’t talk about others that way, then why talk to yourself like that? You’re a human being too and you deserve compassion. _AT_MENTION_ that sucks.

174373813,"Yeah, you’re right. I don’t see any possible way you can keep taking Dexedrine long term. It’s dangerous and unhealthy and if you take it for a long time most likely it won’t keep schizophrenia at bay and it will probably cause other physical or mental problems besides schizophrenia. I don’t have any articles or science to back me up, I’m just going by common sense and my own experience being addicted to drugs awhile back. If you keep taking that amount I don’t see it ending well."

176125158,I’ve got the same deal. My ex-boss works with disabled people and knows about SSDI. A few years ago she scheduled me for more hours than I usually work and I explained to her that it would put me over the limit. She told me not to worry and told me she can either call SSDI herself or wrote them a letter or have me explain to them myself that she is aware of the rule about going over the limit but it was her fault and it would only go over the limit for a couple paychecks. Social Security was fine with that and I earned more money than I was supposed to for a month and didn’t lose my benefits. I don’t know if this is standard policy for Social Security all over the country but I live in California and it saved my benefits.

I used to write very short sentences years ago and even lost the motivation or “ability” to read. It’s easy to write because I can just sit on my computer and write. I don’t think I could make any money and I worry about my paranoia and safety sometimes. I can’t really write a novel or fiction (I never learned how to write stories) but I can learn. They have online classes. I get paranoid about people stealing my stuff. It’s like I don’t do stupid online super soldier videos or interviews or go anywhere because I would highly regret it and feel even more stupid and disabled and would want it deleted permanently off the internet. I made stupid YouTube videos on impluse and because I was desperate and I deleted them all. I sometimes would delete them right away or even a couple weeks or even a month later. People wouldn’t believe what I wrote if I decided to w
rite a short book or story. I often psyche myself out of it because my thoughts are all jumbled together and disorganized.

174373842,"He said it himself, about rejecting delusions. But time did lessen symptoms so age was a major player "" Thus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again"""

I think it’s because they all thought it was a tragedy and I was too young to see the tragedy in it and just thought it was an awesome sight. I think I was scolded for it.
176125234,17 years old going to high school. I was really depressed at the time.
176125235,"I may have thoughts that I am very important, historical apostle of moraunism (monotheistic radical universalism, which is anti-catholic and anti-quranic, it denies some dogmas of Catholic faith and is obvious wishful thinking) or great teacher of Quran (for example due to coincidences with some supposed numerical miracles of that book). In 2017 I had “going” to day hospital (Polish: oddzia? dzienny) which lasted from 27.4.2017 to 24.7.2017. Shortly after that I read that first chapter of islamic scripture has 7 verses, 29 words and 139 letters. 7, 29, 139 - they are prime numbers with primes as sums of digits. Now I know another triplet interestingly similar to it which I nicknamed “giant egg”. I noticed “giant egg” on the page about so-called Easter eggs in certain computer game. “Giant egg” was associated with first entry on that page. There was logo which has numbers 5 and 23 on left side and number 421 on right. 5, 23, 421 - they are prime numbers with primes as sums of digits. 
I may have ideas that 21 7 and 3, 6, 9 are somewhat associated with mathematical “miracles” of Quran. Also as associated with them could be considered: Thabit numbers (more precisely, prime ones), “miraculous quartet of arithmetic sequences” (associated with primes), numbers 13 and 31 (“mirror” primes) and dates 27.4.2017 and 24.7.2017. From biblical and christian perspective all these dependences in Quran look to be rather craftiness of satans. They may be very dangerous for catholic faith. “Natural” religion of my mentality, moraunism, considers Quran the worst book in entire history, worse than Bible."
176125236,yea i think dream and reality become hard to take apart from each other. It’s like when you are doing ok then dreams are easy to recognize but when you become psychotic the lines get blurred and dream and reality harder to keep apart.

174373839,"Well, my theory is that when someone doesn’t have schizophrenia, then putting that person on antipsychotics will only cause what it causes to all of us complaining about worsening condition. I mean, it does lower your dopamine and serotonine levels, so given that I was already depressed, it just made me even more miserable. It’s difficult to find someone who really is schizophrenic and that the LAI caused this person to suffer. If you are SZ, then it most likely is going to help you, if not, then you’ll live a miserable life."

176125245,"I have those same fears and don’t tell many people about my diagnosis or what I deal with… I don’t think it’s paranoia though because it’s a rational fear (that people will look at you differently when they know what your diagnosis is) People are genuinely ignorant, petty, fearful, but then in some cases also kind. You can reasonably expect people to react, in good and bad ways, when hearing this about you. I was fairly recently moved to a different school for work. I haven’t told anyone there, but five people at my previous location know about me. Being discreet and understanding human weaknesses is not paranoia."
176125246,If it’s drug induced then you prob don’t have sz. I had drug induced sz like symptoms twice and they went away after a few months. It wasn’t until years later that sz hit me with no drug use at all… and hard

176125260,Some call it gluttony A deadly sin I used to call it dealing with life Through food’s medicine And poison I ate family sizes during one meal Of sugar and salt I had too much of my fill It allowed me to sleep sometimes To end the nightmare of the day For a short time Before the effect wore away Other times it simply calmed me For a while That was before the inevitable happened And diabetes became my status And I had to stop eating so much Don’t get me wrong I still sometimes gain weight And I sometimes eat too much But the food is different now And lasts longer on my shelf But I know that the damage is done And I’ll never again fit in a waist size 31 And my body is older than it should be And no matter how I die I want the death chart to say My end came through gluttony
176125261,"Okay, not really a cocktail because it’s only a few medicines but it’s the only word I could think of. So recently, I saw my new psychiatrist/behavioral medicine doctor and she decided that soon, I’m going to be put back on Lamictal because I’ve been having sleeping problems while on the Vraylar and it’s gotten worse recently. She said something about it being possible to be on Vraylar and Lamictal at the same time, but I’m skeptical about it, even if she is a doctor. While I have no heart issues that I know of, I read that heart complications can happen from the two interacting, but only if the individual has already had heart issues (if I recall correctly). It just makes me nervous at the possibility of a serious health condition happening just because I took the wrong medicines at the same time. Has anyone ever taken Lamictal and Vraylar at the same time? Should I call her again tomorrow (if they’re open) and tell her what I think?"

I tried many supplement for negative in the past and it works a week at most before it didn’t work at all.Which do you take dmg or tmg,how long are you on them,why didn’t you insist on dmg as it first said it heals you when even try tmg if it works?"
176125280,Yeah I don’t care anymore about being called names. People in my town are ???? starters. So it’s best to ignore them.
176125281,"Yes, they did stop. How it started was, I was experiencing very high stress levels that resulted in psychosis. I’d never heard of stress induced psychosis, but there it happened. The stress also caused insomnia, and so I had not slept much for several days. Actually, sleep was scarce for weeks before it happened, and that wasn’t very good. I was up for like 2 days straight at a time, and in between just fall asleep for 2/3 hours. I was feeling all weird, like I wasn’t in reality. Suddenly one night, when I was lying in bed, I realised I could hear voices that weren’t there. Very frightening, but it’s gone fortunately. i think mine were started after i overdosed meth Yes, drugs are very well known to cause psychosis. That’s very likely the cause in your case, or at least that’s what aggravated it. I highly recommend you stay away from drugs and alcohol while you dealing with this. Get lots of sleep too. Most importantly, see a psychiatrist for medication. Good luck!"

Pants I have a 31 inch waist so a large/XL stretchy fabric. Can’t wear anything that isn’t elastic waist cause of my hip right now. But I lost a ton of weight, and I really like the clothes he picks out to surprise me. Funniest story is I was out cold from sleeping pills, he sits me up and tries to use a fabric measure tape to figure out my bra size to get me a pretty bra. I woke up during this, looked at him, and he just said “pretend I’m not here.” I laughed, helped him correctly measure, then went back to bed. Bra he picked was cute, but 2 inches bigger in the band woulda been more comfortable, but it’s manageable."

176125289,That’s great _AT_MENTION_. Do you like doing it?
174373862,You see I am on a much older depo than you it is said that it can worsen negative symptoms. I have anhedonia and the hole spectra of negative symptoms but it’s the only depo that works for my positive symptoms. Beside of that I also take two atypical antipsychotics. To be honest. When first the positive symptoms are gone then the negative symptoms makes it much to easy to get realy bored.
176125290,"Hey! I actually take prescribed parkinson’s med that contains levodopa. I strongly advise you not to take it. This must be done at the discretion of your doctor. L-dopa can alter the dopamine level of your brain, and that could be dangerous. Mine contains very small amounts of levodopa and is mainly for relieving spasticity. But levodopa can be VERY dangerous if taken without discretion. I was taking another kind of L-Dopa and I was having psychotic episodes a day after I took it."

176125292,Now that you mention it it does look a bit grey. But might be the power of suggestion!
176125293,"There is considerable overlap of the symptoms of psychosis/sz with spiritual ailments such as jinn posession - both, for example, can exhibit hearing voices or sudden changes in personality or visual hallucinations The issue is spiritual people are not to be trusted - they often masquerade as telling the truth but in fact make up lies and will attribute anything to posessions, because they charge for spirit removal services"

176125300,"Haldol is a strong dopamine blocker.

174373851,"I’m over stressed. I havent felt this stressed in a while. Not even during my last psychotic break. A lot of things in my life changed suddenly. I had chest reconstruction surgery a couple months ago (I’m transgender). That was a lot of healing and then I started seeing a bunch of new specialists from being newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. I got a case manager, health coach, and new gp. This wasnt long after my last psychotic break. I was nervous but that all went well. Then I had 6 weeks from work, went back and put into 2 weeks and started another job. So two part time jobs for 2 weeks. New job is easier and better for me. Then me and my girlfriend went camping and while we were there we found out my brother wanted to rehome his dog. We love him so we had to go get him the day after we came back from camping. That was a lot of driving. Mean while my mental health is falling apart. I’m not experiencing reality it seems all fake and so far away. I dont want to interact with people in real 
life. Then my new dog attacked my much smaller dog and I took her to the vet, shes on antibiotics but not hurt bad. Now one of my rats is dying of a brain tumor. Yes I have a lot of pets. I love them all and they’re the only thing that makes me want to live."

I managed to scrape by in that course which pulled my average down quite a bit. I am not sure I can compare to what you’re studying, so only on a basic level I understand what is happening to you. If you got accepted at a masters level you have the potential to do this. You need to find a way to crack Python.

I am not sure how I did it, but I know it’s possible to fight back and complete it. Maybe if this professor asks you something you don’t know, try posing a question back that’s relatable instead of trying to answer it - you may learn more that way.

Everyone in my high school or university turned out alright. I used to be one of the top students. Now I’m not doing better than the popular kid who got low grades and currently making more money as a car mechanic or an inheritor of a company. I worry about getting a spouse because of the _USER_ID_ surrounding schizophrenia and the family shame that comes along with it.

176125431,"Hi, I got a little problem and in need of some opinions: Since January I have a new psychotherapist with whom I had my first five appointments to see if we could work together. After that we prepared the application form for my health insurance so they’ll pay for the therapy and my therapist sent it to the insurance, the insurance realized I already had a therapy in the last two years which then requires more information from the therapist why I need a therapy again now. I got letters from my insurance saying there are documents missing which my therapist should write and send them. I tried really really often to call him but he never picked up. He was at his office but he definitely just didn’t pick up on purpose. I know that because a friend of mine is his patient too and she indeed was able to get him on the phone and she also had appointments in these weeks I tried to call him. So now that’s the point. My therapist simply didn’t send any documents to my insurance. He just told them he m
ay need up to three weeks to do that. These three weeks will be over this friday. In between I managed to have a phone conversation with the therapist (that was before I knew about his three week deadline - the insurance told me that later). I asked him if we’re still trying to get this therapy paid and if he’s still on it. He reacted a bit weird, like annoyed. But I’m not sure, I might have misinterpreted that. So the point is: I wait until Friday, 10. and ask my insurance if they received the documents from my therapist. BUT. What if he did send the documents and I could get my therapy with him? Would you still want that? With a guy who simply ignored you over several weeks even though he knew you are again drifting into a severe psychotic episode and need someone to talk, skills and help immediately? I’m not sure what I’ll do. I would be so glad if you could tell me what you would do in my place. So maybe I can weigh the Pros and Cons. Thank you all in advance!"

If you own a home or rent find something more affordable, sell your car for a cheaper version. It really sounds like you have been doing way too much and it is starting to affect your job and now causing you great financial stress. Your health and mind come first. Material possessions can eventually end up owning you. I like the keep life simple idea. Maybe my mum had a premonition that I would one day become ill. I hope you will work things out."

No longer how many times it claims to be a person, it’s just a hallucination, like the echo from a cave. My suggestion is to try and realize that the voice is just a hallucination and not a real person. This would lead to a great sense of relief and the voices would have less power over you. This might be hard to do though and might require medication."

Personally, I do not have sz- I have a slightly different diagnosis that tends to go on frequent remissions when I stay on meds. This is why, despite not having delusions or paranoia, I am still on meds. Self care is vital. Meds aren’t everything. You have to feed yourself well, take care of yourself, and make sure your basic needs are met. Also, if you want to become a psychiatrist, you should be in therapy to take care of your mental health too. _NAME_ says that therapy is important to mental health professionals too and she even goes to therapy. Also, discuss this with your pdoc. He’ll suggest helpful tips. All the best."

176125554,Hope all will be good dude
176125555,"I had a dream last night that I was told I could help people. There were some people doing distracting things with parties and social games etc. It felt kind of like an epiphany but _PERSON_ scared to say that word now…because i cant talk about it. Ok, so how can i help people? hmmm well Im going to work on myself for now, and eventually I will be able to help merely by being myself… I dont know. but i hope that being sensitive doesnt destroy me, or caring…too much…"
176125556,"Yes, tooth infection can do lots of things to your system. I got really sick, then had an infected tooth pulled and was immediately better. It can be inflammatory response, or stress induced from pain. You should see a doctor and a dentist if you have a bad tooth."
176125557,My pharmacist does the same things as _AT_MENTION_ ’s. I get a partial fill and I pay for that portion.
176125558,Do you know how I address fear of abandonment? Do you have any practical tips?
176125559,"My only regular social life is spending time with my husband. I talk regularly to my mom and occasionally to my sister. I have one friend who I met through an outpatient support group starting in 1993. I haven’t seen her in seven years though (we live 2 1/2 hours apart now), but we regularly e-mail once or twice a month. I had one friend I made when I worked at the university, but she doesn’t know about my sza so I stopped talking to her. Not in a rude way, just stopped calling and eventually she stopped too. I don’t want to tell her, so I just let it be silent now. She would probably say we are still friends, but I haven’t talked to her in about two years."
176125560,sounds yummy _AT_MENTION_
176125561,"The main influence in weight is how you eat. But regular walking will really help too. Nice one in the hour walk that’s a really solid amount of physical activity! Best of luck with it, it’s very difficult but you’re strong and you can reach that goal…"
176125562,Right when I feel I’m getting better the cycle repeats itself and my illness gets the best of me again
176125563,It gets better! You can have a perfectly good life in head meds.
176125564,Awww thanks. _PHONE_NO_
176125565,A med. that might put someone into a deep sleep for twenty hours might not have any effect on another person.
176125566,"Nope, not during psychosis. I can tell you that today there was a hacked-off bluejay on my back patio wanting to know why I hadn’t put more peanuts out. He communicates well. And loudly."
176125567,It’s not a thought he is putting in your mind. It is your brain playing tricks with you. Talk to your doctor.
176125568,"Praying seems to make the voices somewhat nicer, but curing SZ requires physical medicine."
176125569,Looking through A set of eyes Makes you wonder And realize What to say What to hold Who to judge Who to know Yet we still believe That we are whole
176125570,The reason I have a hard time is I had visions of them dying.
176125571,"I want to go into medical research, hopefully. I anticipate it will take roughly 6 years from now before I get a doctorate, if I even do. I might decide to hold off on the doctoral program until Starlet graduates, but I might go ahead and try. I have at least 2 years to decide, anyways."
174373937,It sounded serious so i went and google it.
176125572,"Wait…she’s private messaging people? If the messages are triggering or botheri g you, flag them. We can’t help without the flags. We do not have access to PMs otherwise."
176125573,Drugs won’t stop your mental illness. You’ll end up with a more severe mental illness plus a drug addiction and financial problems.
174373939,"That’s true, I was unmedicated or using weed whenever I was violent. The statistic is from Wikipedia."
176125574,whats your view on synchronicity…?
176125575,"Oh, okay. I am glad that you gave a number of advice. I am less puzzled and feel better now."
176125576,Back before I had sz it was really easy to work
176125577,"ive been off clonazepam a while now, didnt taper and had some pretty bad withdrawal and then a month later once i was far out of acute withdrawal i started taking it again for a few days because of anxiety. since then ive been off now for 33 days and i plan on not having to take it again. dont try to drop the dose too quick, diazepam is the best to taper with because it has a very long half life but some people take months or even years to taper depending on how long they’ve been on them and how high of a dose"
176125578,I need to take the shot because otherwise I would end upbin a psych ward
176125579,"She’s been living with us for two years now with no end in sight. My husband really needs to step up to the plate and get her out of here, But I don’t see that happening. He’s afraid she’ll feel abandoned, But he’s at risk of losing me and my sanity if she stays. It’s a huge mess."
176125580,"There’s not enough compassion in the US, there’s too much violence and hate. I’m sometimes afraid to post on social media."
176125581,"Me too _AT_MENTION_ . I get weird, very religious, and people don’t like me when I’m not taking my meds."
176125582,Yes. While I sit here eating a Klondike and playing with my goats I plot the medication and support of other mentally ill. How did you find me out? I’m so very sorry that I want people to get well.
176125583,"“Studies of how those psychoactive drugs work have helped us understand modern neurobiology,” said _NAME_, M.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal . “The discovery of how incensole acetate, purified from frankincense, works on specific targets in the brain should also help us understand diseases of the nervous system. This study also provides a biological explanation for millennia-old spiritual practices that have persisted across time, distance, culture, language, and religion – burning incense really does make you feel warm and tingly all over!”"
176125584,"Educate yourself, what can I say ? Psycho education is important, but rarely taught. It can be picked up from micro expressions and body language to stories, experiences and even emotions. It’s a broad subject to tackle and no psychologist or group therapy can ever explain it to you. But its good you decided to do this, its important."
176125585,I also read that it also occurs in thought disorders like sz. Im not sure. It could be one or the other. since you hear voices probably just the sz.
174373941,"I have googled,some people complain of mucus too…yea,I will just ditch the box mod"
176125586,"It’s 11:55 pm. I just made it home from the ball before I turned into a pumpkin. Damn, I lost a glass boot somewhere, dammit. I actually drove across town to Der Weinerschitzal to use a coupon for a chili dog and a corn dog but there were cars lined up in the streets to get in so I went up the street to McDonalds and used a coupon for a free quarter pounder. After a hot day, it was pretty cool out and I just wanted a leisurely drive home but my sister may be right, it’s almost impossible to have a relaxing drive in Silicon Valley."
176125587,Some are good … some are bad… like him telling me to depart from him or him saying he doesn’t know me… those are things I fear so they come out in the hallucinations

176125591,My brother-in-law has just come up with a solution to my smoking problem and I think I will give it a go. This might help _AT_MENTION_ too. Use the nicotine patches and vape with a non nicotine based oil until you wean yourself off the patches and just end up with a vape habit that does not contain nicotine.

176125595,I don’t think I have psychosis anymore
176125596,Hi! I thought that here we could ask general questions about a certain medicine Start your post with the name of the medicine
176125597,"Apparently Italy has one of the oldest populations aswell, that may be a contributing factor."
176125598,"Off meds I get violent thoughts and become irritable, suicidal and violent around ppl (family only thankfully). I went 2yrs without meds and now thinking about it if I went longer I could have been violent with ppl other than my family too. Before sz I was one of the best in school. These thoughts disturbed me and my grades went down since 16y.o. They were more in the background but got more and more intense until my diagnosis and still get intense when I stop meds. I feel like I developped another personality since getting sz, a bad evil one. Is that why sz is called split mind? Meds switch me to the good one but give me severe negative symptoms staying in bed all day everyday. Sometimes I think about stopping meds as I get less negative symptoms than now on Risperdal. Idk if my severe negative symptoms are any better than being suicidal and violent off meds."
174373947,"I’m sad for him. I’m also worried that this will further stigmatize sz because of his fame, much like _NAME_ and bipolar disorder. They are in the spotlight, and that’s not a good thing when they are representing the mentally ill."
174373943,I’ve taken all these meds starting at the age of 40 when my psychosis began. Nothing has touched my psychosis. Here’s the list of them. Invega 3 mg Haldol Decanoate 100 mg/mL Invega sustenna 234 mg/1.5 mL Haloperidol 5 mg Latuda 120 mg Olanzapine 20 mg Chlorpromazine 25 mg Abilify 20 mg Risperidone 2 mg Seroquel 50mg Trifluoperazine 5 mg two tabs Zyprexa 20 mg Vraylar 4.5 mg
176125599,Has anyone had the delusion of seeing another person living their life in their head as if you had a movie of someone else living their life in your head?
176125600,"I really feel for you. My voices are terrible too and don’t ever go away. (Unless I’m asleep…and then they give me upsetting dreams.) If you want more info, you can check my post activity for some of the stories. You are not alone."
176125601,Fall asleep in the next 15 minutes Write down some things I did today Do a body scan
176125602,"As time passes I remember when things were unstill. I give into it, not willingly and without passion. My breath no longer has the taste of it. Things creep up over me, and I let them. What am I to do until then? When will it be what I want? Will it ever? I don’t know, but someday will. It’s not a delusion, but sometimes I wish it were. To be meaningless in the scheme. I still feel it deeply though. Until the pills take it away from me."
176125603,"In a sense you will get torchered with all the medical complications coming along with smoking. I couldn’t trust that either, but its true, hard to believe but that is how its being told. I found happieness in my hell, but don’t tell anybody."
176125604,"I’m shy and I don’t talk enough, so it is not that easy for me. but I could get a girlfriend that talks a lot."
174373951,"The more I read about these two studies, the more confused I get. Have they identified two different types of schizophrenia with different biomarkers? One high and one low hydrogen sulfide? It would seem like it would be essential to know which kind you had, if that’s the case. And where would you even get tested? This makes it just seem like a stab in the dark. Plus they mention high homocysteine (as a bad thing). NAC helps lower that, so does sulforaphane (according to the internet) but both release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Which might be good or might be bad, maybe. _AT_MENTION_ ? _AT_MENTION_ ? Who else might have an idea about it?"
176125605,I don’t know. I know Jesus is real. Nobody can tell me he’s not but I promise you the dude that was in my room last night wasn’t Him. He was just dressed like Him
176125606,Yeah im ok thank you
176125607,I hope that you are not being stalked _AT_MENTION_. Stay safe!!
176125608,"You seem to have issues with both your parents _AT_MENTION_ , Do you hate people in general?"
176125609,"Hi. Welcome to the forum! I have been taking the same meds you are currently on for over 10 years. I believe zyprexa can cause inflammation in the brain and impair cognitive thinking. I have also had a lot of stressfull symptoms. About 7 years after starting on zyprexa I got drugdependent to the degree that I no longer was able to sleep without taking the medications. If I skip the medications for one day I usually get no sleep at all. I am seldom able to power down during the day time. I almost never get sleepy or a feeling of genuine relaxation which I had pre meds. What helps for me is supplementing. I take a combo of magnesium, fish oil and melatonin before bedtime which gives me a deeper sleep, and then I get less stressfull the next day. I also supplement with brain supporting supplements like lechitin with choline, and amino acid complex. If you are vegan you should be especially aware of getting the following nutritions: B12, choline and taurine, and omega 3 which you already got covered. I 
went vegetarian for about 1 1/2 years and the stress sky rocketed because I didn’t supplement to fill the gap from not eating meats. You can get choline from lechitin products amongst other things, and taurine and B12 can be bought as individual supplements. Taking a amino acid complex might also be a good idea since most of our amino acid traditionally comes from eating meats. I take pea protein powder which contains most of the amino acids. I hope some of this helps and you will be able to lessen your stress."
174373948,"Take your medicine, even when you don’t want to. When you don’t want to, talk to your medical team, if its an emergency and you need to contact them instantly do not hesitate to call 911 Your mental health emergency is just as valid as any other. Akathisia is a serious movement disorder that you might develop from psychiatric medicine, it can be tormenting. Do not take your own life, there are medicines that can solve this problem relatively quickly. Give the medicine time, Schizophrenia can be one of the most troubling illnesses to get a grip on. Be proactive about transitioning from one medicine to another if you have bad side effects. Keep track of your weight and try to immediately control your calories and if you still gain weight try to get your doctor to transition you to a new medication. You will gain weight on most medications."
176125610,What is your diagnosis? People don’t usually listen to things like that on here.
176125611,I rarely to never get visitors when I am hospitalized. I think my mom visited me a couple of times. My best friend visited me once. That’s about it. And I’ve been hospitalized millions of times.
176125612,You can’t undo bad things from the past. You just have to move forward and try not to repeat the same mistakes.
176125613,I get like that. But for me it comes in waves. Right now I’m in a productive period so I’m milking it.
176125614,"What is this _NAME_ syndrome?I have had delusions that last 10 years or more and i get so tired of them. Then it seems like punishment. But lately I think I have had some breakthroughs and don’t notice about some of the things I have been praying for. Certain situations and people can be a trigger so that something will show up, long thought gone and bring me to my senses about who I still am."

176125617,Good morning again. Did you ask your doc about switching to abilify pills yet?
176125618,Yes I still hear voices and it’s ok. My baby was healthy and fine.

176125637,why was i diagnosed with autism although my brain scan was normal
176125638,It’s still just your brain noticing some of the weird coincidences that happen to everyone.

176125640,Google “ Meetup.com ” and your city to see if there’s any groups that interest you. If so you could go along to one and meet new people.

176125645,"This is so true. I’m autistic and some horrible things happened to me as a child because of it. But my oldest child is autistic and has greatly benefited from having an autistic parent. I see mainly the positive aspects of autism within this child. I’m proud to have passed this part of myself on. (It’s not all easy and I’m not trying to say it is, but for my child the good outweighs the difficulties they face.) Unfortunately, this child also has psychosis, and that’s something I’m NOT proud of passing on. I am wondering if I would be diagnosed with autism at all, if the psychosis was known at the time of diagnosis. I recall hearing that the neuropsychologist was teetering between schizophrenia and autism as they really are much more similar than people tend to think (at least in terms of negative symptoms). And before autism was called autism, it was called infantile schizophrenia."
176125646,I love they way you always get the colour right on white areas. The way you mix blues and browns in the shading works really well.
176125647,"If you’re capable of claims such as conflict arises from a misunderstanding of “Egyptian dinner etiquette…” then you’re capable of untethering from the likes of me. So maybe drop the focus. Because you’re currently “putting in the hours to keep me in sunglasses, I know.”"

176125654,Sure I think a lot about the scene in fight club bc of insomnia but most self deprecating is the ‘caffeine enema’ comment he makes to his perky boss. Coffee makes me really happy and wrongly fills me with confidence that my thoughts are gold. I know I will be better because delusions are rigid and it will make me consistent (I hope at least). Thanks for the acknowledgment _AT_MENTION_
176125655,"My mum has undiagnosed depression imo. At least one of my uncles has psychosis and the other one may have it too. Well for sure I know he has OCD. Quite bad at one point he was overwhelmed to even see colours. _PERSON_ if that is still the case. He spends most of his time in bed and apparently he used to shout stop out loud, voices??"
174373954,"I have to go to bed very early. If I want to wake up in 6:30 AM, I have to go to sleep in 8:30 PM. Also , in the beginning , in first 4 years, I had problems with constipation so I had to drink water with large magensium content and I had to drink lactulose. But that improved after 4 years and now I don’t have any problems with constipation."

176125660,"I’ve had so many jobs. Mostly in college I was a Cashier, then after graduating a Medical Technologist and Laboratory Scientist. There were bad conditions at 2 places, so I moved away and worked in telemarketing and came back, worked in Marketing and Office support."
174373960,Mine have gotten better. I get quite a few things done although I struggle to start projects that have a lot of steps. Some things like grocery shopping or taking care of my cat are pretty automatic for me. I still feel a little uncomfortable taking showers but I think that is mainly because I am afraid of losing my balance. If I feel unsteady or sick I sometimes wash my hair in the kitchen sink and use washcloths. I generally plan out each day now although it almost always changes depending on family needs and other circumstances. I have to be happy if I get one or two really important things done each day.

174373969,I have been schizophrenic for 8 years now. I had to move back home and everything. I am 35 living at home. I hate it. I am just so scared to live on my own. I feel like I am giving up hope because I have been hospitalized 7 times. Every job I have had since I have been schizophrenic haven’t worked out. I am currently on disability and I feel useless. I am embarrassed. All three of my sister’s have houses and boyfriends. I feel so embarrassed when they visit the house. They also don’t understand and tell me how I let fear keep me from getting a job. I just don’t know how to move ahead. I want to work but have no references. I don’t know if it’s the invega sustenna I am on or what. I just have no motivation . But I won’t give up. I believe in God and I have hope.

176125682,"_AT_MENTION_ Changing from Solian to Aripirazole definitely quietened it down for me. Had a few weeks without it. Often it’s explaining my symptoms, kind of thinking about my thinking. But it’s not under control and the same sentence loops until a new one pops in. Sometimes I’m just explaining some basic science or whatever, it’s not always about me. But usually there is somebody that I am explaining things to. It doesn’t reach a conclusion and the person I’m explaining to doesn’t get a word in. Is your explaining things to your pdoc like this?"

176125688,I experienced the same things… Turns out after long time of being careful with my thoughts that the voices are occuring based on my thoughts/feelings. When I’d think about how demons can give me temptations I suddenly hear a demonic like voice saying things uncontrollably. Or with a phrase based off of my thought about demons.
176125689,Hear the person out. Keep resolution intent in mind. Not attacking intent. Why do you ask? Are you thinking there might be an argument soon?
176125690,I’d say not but everyone’s journey is a little different. Be patient. That is the hardest thing to say to you because I think your young and immature and you want everything to be explained now. It takes time and that means you’ve just got to ride the wave…I always suggest newcomers to take up psychic surfing. You ride out the bad times and rejoice in the good. Symptoms come in brackets and waves and can be cyclic. Learn patience.

My boss/friend knew before she hired me. My kid’s school knows. All my fb friends know and I describe different ways the illness impacts my life. And by appearing normal, I mean I can hide my symptoms. They’re mostly negative and when feeling weird I don’t interact with anyone."

174373968,The pdoc said one psychosis isn’t enough to DX schizophrenia. So yes possible could have been due to extreme anxiety and I know I was extremely stressed.
174373973,I get negative symptoms off meds as well as on them but as I have sza it could be depression too. Off meds I have severe depression and mood swings and on meds I am calmer so even though I feel a bit dead I can get a bit more done - only a bit. Better than lying comatose on floor or racing around dancing and laughing at everything

176125704,i think it’s hard to have good boundaries if you are the one more dependent on others. I bet a lot of people with any kind of illness feels that way. mental illness is all about being misunderstood. invisible illnesses.

176125722,"I once had to poop and asked to use the bathroom at a family rental store. The manager made an excuse about it just having been cleaned. I was with my brothers new girlfriend soon to be wife. I slipped out, and started duck walking towards another store across the street. Mid way through and its alarm bells ringing I was about to poop myself. I made a decision. Poop in my draws or squat in front of two lane traffic on the bizziest main street in town. Well I decided I could wipe up if I walked to the store and finished up. Thus my pants remained mostly unsullied. I’m happy to say that I don’t have trouble pooping in public restrooms and generally do well if they’re reasonably clean. Well anyway I walked back after washing up and the family was worried I’d had a skit or something but I was mums the word. I do not know if she ever found out but my brother is welcome she didn’t have to clean her fancy truck seats. LOL Seriously though I really wish you luck in this trying time bud. I hope sh

176125725,"Some people are genetically predisposed towards addiction. Maybe you’re one of them. The most common way to beat an addiction is to replace it with another addiction. So instead of smoking, some people chew gum. Instead of drinking beer, maybe seltzer water. Instead of gaming, some people get addicted to running or exercising. The basic concept is to take something better for you and use it to replace the thing that was bad for you."

176125728,"“Angels who commit an unforgivable sin, are sentenced to one life of suffering.” - I don’t know where I came across that line, but it’s been sticking with me a lot lately. Something about it calls to me, like it’s some hidden truth that only I can see. I insert myself as the subject a lot. Bad habit. “Everything seems so cut and dry, day and night, earth and sky. But somehow I still don’t believe it” I don’t want the memories, I don’t want to be chosen, and I want out. Stop the ride man, my soul is feeling sick… I still hear the angels sometimes. “Will he remember?” “ I don’t know” I caught that amongst the background noise inside my head. Part of me is scared. I’m scared this world will fade away like losing a dream when I wake up to an older and greater consciousness. I hope I can remember. Hope I can learn from being trapped in my flesh prison. Need to stop the thoughts, distract, overcome. I try so hard. But how do you remove the thoughts? “Thoughts arrive li
ke butterflies” Maybe the Hindus are on to something. The voices have called me Bodhisattva in the past. But I can’t say I’ve ever ascribed them clout twards my delusions. Rant over.

176125738,Here is a model I created in ZBrush today. I know the fingers look a little flat but I’m happy with the way the overall shape came out.
176125739,hmm… weekends arent too bad for me. i cant work so i stay home a lot most days and if i need to get out of my apt i go to visit my parents and spend the night there for a day or two. but internet helps me stay in contact with people on a daily basis. i dont have any luck with women so i dont hear from them much but my ex is like that sometimes. as far as blaming me for why we broke up. but if you need a break from the strain of work instead of going out to the bar maybe find a local group that meets for a common purpose. could be a church meeting or a support group or just see your family and friends and visit with them. im not sure the specifics on your ordeal but if you are not happy then that is not ok. so keep trying new things to get to where you want to be so you can be happy. although sometimes the occasional sadness is normal and healthy so your body can express itself but when it becomes regular then you should do something.

176125755,"If you tell the doctor you are suicidal, feel like hurting yourself or others there is a good chance you’ll be admitted to the hospital. I hear voices say things like that regularly, Things like if I don’t do this or that I will die, or my husband will die, or my dog will die. I don’t think thinking things like that would necessarily get you put in the hospital. It really all depends on how much of a risk they think you are. Be honest with your doctor, You may or may not end up in the hospital. If you do, know that it’s not that bad. Really. People complain a lot about being in the psych unit, but it’s not the worst by any means. If you need to go, you need to go. Try not to let fear of being in the hospital get in the way of proper treatment."
176125756,that’s good news =)
176125757,"Marijuana is very complicated substance to ingest. Something like 2000 to 3000 unique chemical substances… among them the cannabinoids are the chemicals with most notable effects. All smoke is inherently carcinogenic. How it effects the brain is pretty subjective from person to person… on a general basis… it is powerful enough to retrain the brains natural reward system to be dependent on using weed. THC is not an addictive substance… the body does not develop a unique dependency on the substance that leads to genuine withdrawals… however the potency of the effect on the brain secondarily does lead to neurological and associated psychological changes. It’s sort of like sugar… people who eat sugary foods find it difficult to enjoy more “plain” substances like vegitables. When they go without sugar they have all sorts of different cravings and moods and complaints… however they don’t actually need to eat sugar… when they quit the junk food the more or less immediately start ge
tting healthier. However if they don’t quit they still sit in the cycle of psychological addiction top sugar/weed. Really pot is just a drug that promises a sense of escape and control over one’s life and sense of identity… I personally would advise you pursue more valid ways of finding those three things. You smoke pot… you face risks… risks that can actually be fatal in the case of mental illness, schizophrenics most risky in that category. You don’t smoke pot… you don’t lose anything. You can be happy, confident, cool, fit in with people… all and everything in the world is still open to you (arguably even more so… because the consumption of pot does get in the way.) Like lets take this for example. A guy is girl-shy… when he’s not high he starts aspiring to rising above his own nerves and proving himself (to himself basically) that he can communicate and potentially get along with women and maybe even get some sex in the end… then the same guy smokes some weed… and suddenly all 
of that becomes the most frightening thing the guy can consider. That’s how it was for me. I haven’t smoked pot in like 8 years… and in that time I’ve slept with like 10 different women (none really worth writing home about)… but if I had still been smoking weed that whole time… I’d have been locked in my own cowardice singing myself to sleep with excuses… only to cyclically smoke pot as the only escape… which basically perpetuated the whole ordeal. _PERSON_… I quit smoking pot 8 years ago and now I have so much self-esteem that actual self-confidence/self-approval… are things I don’t really worry about."

176125795,I fear for my life everyday because the tv is telling people to bother me and is influencing people to taunt me. And I also believe people are deceiving me when they say it’s no camera on me.
176125796,"Jealousy has its roots in ownership. Possession of a person is what is indicated in the ritual of marriage as though they were property. That is why jealousy often occurs because they feel they own another person and in that wish to control and manipulate them to their own conditioning. It doesn’t work though as the premise is flawed. The notion of owning someone when the idea is to set the other person free has had its day. This generation will probably see themselves getting married a few times in their life, rather than the ideal of one soul mate per life which is few and far between. Jealousy is inherently bad but it is dictated by a society that predicates it. It makes you feel awful and is best avoided at all costs."
176125797,my pdoc is pretty nice. He seems empathic too. He really listens to me and helps me well with my meds.

176125833,"Since past few months, I am observing strange things. I go to my office in my car. There are two three different routes. When I change my route after some days, I find police vehicles on new route and policeman driving his vehicle near to my vehicle. After that I usually stick to new route and police person disappears in a day or two. After few weeks of this, If I change my car route due to some reason like dropping of a colleague or due to purchase of goods from a shop, then also suddenly police person appears and drive their police vehicle to near my car. I also see police persons standing on road and watching me. This has happened to me, for past 5 months, every time when I changed my car route. I dont know why this is happening to me?"

176125851,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665855/ On the one hand is over-treatment and over-medicalization of mental health issues, often fueled by a pharmaceutical industry interested in the broadening of the boundaries of “illness” and in the creation of more and wider diagnostic categories and thus markets for “selling sickness.” On the other hand exists profound under-recognition of the suffering and breadth of mental health issues affecting millions of people across geographies, which is a global problem. Still, our understanding of all aspects of mental health is relatively underdeveloped. As others have acknowledged [3] , [24] , the research base for over-diagnosis and harm from over-treatment remains limited, and so the new initiatives and calls for action are welcomed.

Certain things like time travel, simulation theory, and aliens, I don’t think God wants us to know about. I believe this now. I think the world is cyclical and that the ancient Greeks thought the cosmos was cyclical and everything repeats itself indefinitely. I’m a Christian, but I struggle. I think simulation theory is totally Biblical and consistent, based on a few articles I’ve read. It boggles my mind a lot!"
176125911,School was worst for me too. I could never be home schooled because my parents are too impatient and we don’t get along peacefully enough. I hated school years.

I am the best Ive ever been last four years . Since I met my x boyfriend in sa and got on disability pension I have been stable and best I have ever been.

176125927,I think the gist of it is: if you can’t feel loved for who you are it’s because you have spent most of your life identifying with some mirrored behavior from loved ones who only approve of us by associating who we are as what we do . If we expressed how we really felt? We wouldn’t likely feel accepted because we got the message about who we are as being ‘wrong’ or ‘bad’ long ago. Or rather what we really feel gets usurped by our personal perception that what we feel is ‘wrong’. Makes a lot of sense!

176125930,"The power and omnipotence of voices: subordination and entrapment by voices and significant others Basically, it says that a good way to cope with voices, to be less subordinate or influenced by them is to improve individual status or position, perhaps through group identification, assertive training, and problem-solving therapy. This real-life marginalization and subordination is the cause of voices or subordination to voices. [_USER_ID_] Treating the psychosis alone, for example by eliminating voice activity, does not guarantee improvement in interpersonal schemas and self-esteem, which I assume means that the voices may come back or still have influence if the underlying depression, low self-esteem, subordination, relative low social rank (e.g. social attractiveness and talent, perceived belonging, or fit with a social group, etc.) and relative social power (e.g. strength, confidence, respect, etc.) is not resolved."

176125958,"A lot of the time an out of control patient can be very hard to deal with, and psychiatrists take the brunt of that out of control behavior. Sometimes a psychiatrist must think, “I have got to get some med’s into him before he makes me as crazy as he is.” Do you think the psychiatrist is giving the med’s as punishment, and not as therapy? Sometimes I think psychiatrists do cross over the line as give med’s as punishment and not as therapy. I know their job is hard, but do you want them to give you med’s as punishment? Do you want them to give med’s to your kids as punishment, and not as therapy? We need to maintain the utmost standards of medical discretion in psychiatry."
176125959,Is this feeling of paranoia consistent? At least you aknowledge that you were paranoid which means you maybe got better? I would wait a little while and see if the feeling persists. If it only lasted for a while I wouldn’t read too much into it. I mean everyone can get paranoid for a little while. But if it doesen’t go away any time soon it might be best to get in touch with your doctor.

It was about a research article stating people with psychosis benefit greatly from psychotherapy, but only 8% ever get at least one session, even less get the minimal amount of sessions. I think it is a grave injustice that the people with the severest psychological torment are left to struggle on their own, without a therapist to talk to. When i asked for therapy and lifestyle intervention next to meds, they actually labelled that “lack of insight”. They told me “five years is only a short time to wait for help”.

In this preliminary study, aripiprazole-treated patients were retrospectively investigated for the presence or absence of tachyphylaxis.

174374039,"I don’t think they can be sure exactly what causes negative symptoms. But the supplements and meds that try to target them do use other mechanisms besides dopamine. Since people who aren’t on meds still often have negative symptoms, we can probably say it’s not soley down to dopamine. ITI 007 might have some effects on negative and cognitive symptoms, but they’re going for approval on the basis that it can treat psychosis without some of the metabolic side effects.

176125987,"I was having unresolved depression on zoloft and bumped up to 200 mgs. Unfortunately that was too high a dose for me. I am sza bipolar type and the high dose caused a manic episode. If you aren’t worried about mania then why not try a higher dose? Zoloft is a good anti-depressant, I would take it again if I were allowed, but my pdoc won’t take the chance now. By the way it’s funny how easy it is to walk away from guilt and other negative feelings when we get our brain chemistry straight. Good luck."
174374045,Did your pdoc recommend that you go down to 5? I’m hopefully going to be going down to 10mg.

174374069,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Appearance-based trust processing in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The British journal of clinical psychology , Sep 2019 06 Schizophrenia is characterized by impaired social interactions and altered trust. In the general population, trust is often based on facial appearance, with limited validity but enormous social consequences. The aim was to examine trust processing in schizophrenia and specifically to examine how people with schizophrenia use facial appearance as well as actual partner fairness to guide trusting decisions.An experimental economic game study.Here, we tested how patients with schizophrenia and control participants (each N = 24) use facial trustworthiness appearance and partner fairness behaviour to guide decisions in a multi-round Trust Game. In the Trust Game, participants lent money to 'partners' whose facial appearance was either untrustworthy or trustworthy, and who either played fairly or unfairly. Clin
ical symptoms were measured as well as explicit trustworthiness impressions.Overall, the patients with schizophrenia showed unimpaired explicit facial trustworthiness impressions and unimpaired facial appearance biases in the Trust Game. Crucially, patients and controls significantly differed so that the patients with schizophrenia did not learn to discriminate in the Trust Game based on actual partner fairness, unlike control participants.A failure to discriminate trust has important implications for everyday functioning in schizophrenia, as forming accurate trustworthiness beliefs is an essential social skill. Critically, without relying on more valid trust cues, people with schizophrenia may be especially susceptible to the misleading effect of appearance when making trusting decisions.Findings People with schizophrenia made very similar facial trustworthiness impressions to healthy controls and also used facial appearance to guide trust decisions similarly to controls. However, the patient group were less 
able to explicitly distinguish between fair and unfair partners based on their behaviour compared with the control group. Moreover, people with schizophrenia failed to use actual partner fairness to guide their financial decisions in the Trust Game, unlike controls, and this impairment was specific to a social task. People with schizophrenia may be particularly reliant on facial appearance when trusting others, as they may struggle to incorporate more valid trustworthiness information in their decision-making, such as actual partner fairness."

174374072,"Hi. I’ve been acting mad for a while, but the past 3 months have been a living nightmare. If you haven’t tried it, here is a warning to stay away from methamphetamine. It’s the most evil thing ever. It’s black magic basically. Girl introduced me to it, it was all fun and good for a bit. Then all of sudden, it was instant delerium, worse than diphenhydramine (dph/benedryl). I just got out of the psych ward as an involuntary patient (I went awal/awol (?) three times in 5 days of being there. I hallucinated so intensely that I even bought a replica of a 9mm pistol. Weighted the same, and I swear most people would never guess its a fake. I bought it because i thought i genuinely would need it to scare off … “them”. I slept 2 hours every 2 days for 2 weeks. The hallucinations were brutal, I had to develop a “idc, kill me” attitude to cope. I saw family members and heard their voices, it was exact. I was close to suicide, for realsies. Only reason I didn’t is because I knew it would n
ever end or that my death would cause not a funeral, but a party, a celebration of my suicide. People would stand up at the funeral, and mimic or tell jokes of things I said. I even took the fake gun and threatened my father (also had a hunting knife, 8"" in hand), swearing I’d kill him unless he admitted the conspiring against me all these years. IK. ?????? up of me. (note: cops know, I actually had a sane moment, and stupidly called the cops on myself, went to a psych ward for 4 days. father didnt press charges. just as a fyi). They say meth can take the kindest soul and turn them into a demon. It’s true. The pope, the buddha, all would turn into a version of hitler. Stay away from it. I still, a week off it, am worried the hallucinations werent hallucinations, but yeah…im not sleeping well tonight, its too risky to sleep. What if they kill me in my sleep? Yes IK its likely delusion…i have my doubts though. Currently on 20mg of zyprexa and 400 mg abilify injection. Doesn’t do sht to fight it, but 
i feel my spine shake and the thought of what it would be like without the meds. Meth is gross and evil. And it probably has forever ?????? part of my brain. Idk, amphetamine never did this to me, so i thought methamphetamine would be no different than cocaine years past, but last longer and work better than adderall. Nope, its just evil and now half my family wont talk to me, and the ones that will, they aren’t convinced im a good guy anymore. Straight outta hell."

176126121,"Came this afternoon. My sister phoned me at home and said she will come fetch me and won’t take no for an answer. I was so touched! Haven’t seen her in about six years and when I saw her it was like I saw her about a month or two ago. I love her cosy place and one of my nieces was home and I was so happy to see her after so long! She’s so grown up now - 24 years old and last time I saw her she was about 18. The other two I hope to see tomorrow. My husband phoned me from hospital twice and said when is his family coming to fetch him, he is hungry and frustrated. I said he must contact his dad. I messaged both his mom and dad and told them about him and that I’m by my sister for a few days or so, maybe till he comes home. And that they must contact him. They read the message but didn’t answer. Hubby phoned a second time but I never answered because I didn’t hear phone. And had no news for him as I never heard back from them nor the hospital. The hospital is a state general one and not the 
best place but I found it ok when I was there - only boring. But it’s hard on him now and I feel sorry for him. Will contact him tomorrow again after I hear from his parents. I hope he gets better soon but I’m scared to tell him I want to leave as I’m dreading the emotional turmoil of leaving a man I love but who’s toxic in certain ways. Obviously I’m taking a break and not making any decisions now but I still want out. I hope I don’t change my mind as the toxicity is too hard on my mental health. My sister is divorced and has experience of how it is and gives me good advice. My one niece also came out of a long term toxic relationship and has found a new guy who is good for her. I need positive people in my life and although I don’t plan to remarry as of yet I am open to it if I get better and meet someone I trust and is positive. But I don’t plan to look for a guy now.

If you make the wrong choices be prepared for the consequences. Drugs are a good example. If you choose to do drugs or drink you will have to live with all the negative stuff that comes with it. If you choose not to pick up drugs or alcohol that will eliminate a problem that affects many, many, schizophrenics and you’ll be ahead of the game. That’s just an example, taking drugs is a choice. But taking care of a drug or alcohol problem is a choice too. I don’t know about god or grand design or how the universe works but what I do know is that if I go to work three days a week and keep my nose clean and stay out of trouble and not do anything illegal or stupid, I can live a pretty decent life.

Anyways, I still fail in life but at least it’s interesting. And nature is great and free and makes life palpable. This is my take on life."

176126158,Ask your doctor.
176126159,"I thought I relied on mine for sleep, but once I managed to (slowly) taper down and wean off of it, I re-learned how to sleep without it. I thought it would be a problem because I knew I’d sleep less hours, and if I get less than 8.5 hours after taking quetiapine I feel so dead, but it turns out I actually get better rest, so I don’t really need more than 7 hours to feel fine now. I still take it a an emergency aid if I need to just get knocked out and not feel mental pain, but that’s maybe once a month tops. Luckily I respond well to even the lowest doses"
176126160,"Thank you, _AT_MENTION_!"
176126161,40 years. Morning and night and one in the afternoon.
176126162,Oh. I get it. Yeah. The feeling has passed. I know she broke up with her bf recently whom she thought hung the moon. He cheated on her. Maybe she’s sad. Idk.
176126163,Thank you _AT_MENTION_
174374095,"I take only one antipsychotic, Abilify. But I also take two antidepressants, Citalopram and Trazodone."
176126164,"For me I find very little worse than pain. I don’t tolerate it well. But I’m sorry you got told to shut up, that sucks. And I’m sorry you’re screaming in pain. Sometimes I scream out in my sleep and wake myself up, no one tells me to shut up though."
176126165,I asked _AT_MENTION_ this earlier. I think he suspended himself for a while so he could take a break.
176126166,Haha ha wtf man? Funny as fck! I thought girls didn’t fart
176126167,Good luck with it _AT_MENTION_ . Vraylar didn’t work for me but I could only tolerate 1.5mg at the time. Sounds promising for you already.
176126168,Not really. There’s some old psychological experiment where a bunch of students checked themselves into a psych ward pretending to hear voices and they couldn’t get out for a long time.
176126169,After I told them I didn’t need all those medications.they only put me on invega which I’m now off but if I needed over thirty prescriptios why try give them to me then when I say I don’t need them during break down say that’s fine give me invega. Doesn’t make sense
176126170,Yes I felt this when I woke up after I fainted the last time and after my first episode… how am I still here and why… but thankful.
176126171,"So your a big spenders, what if you need money in an emergency, its always good to have some savings"
176126172,I think that if a mentally ill person commits a murder there’s usually a lot of erratic behavior and community problems leading up to it. Gang murders are probably much more subtle.
176126173,Wow. That is scary

176126176,ok today (thursday) was a great day took and edited a ton of photographs got to eat at the table with family for a change had a long phone call with a friend
176126177,Had dinner at the church. It was good. My anxiety spiked because there was a million people there. But I’m home now and doing well.
176126178,That’s beyond odd
174374103,"“Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint due, we believe, to an unexpected high placebo response, we are encouraged by the study results. The consistency of reduction in overall negative symptoms and in the most important subtypes of these symptoms is similar to that observed in the previous Phase 2b study.” I wonder if the FDA will make them do another study."
176126179,"sticking to your diet is a big accomplishment _AT_MENTION_ . I was at a small party last night & it was sooo hard not to _NAME_ on cheese & crackers, there was a lovely spread. Hope today brings some motivation to you. Today I’m a bit sleepy so just taking it easy this morning. Got work this arvo then want to head to a meetup for an hour or two tonight."
176126180,"its a hard one really, great job early intervention psychosis worker from home, 14 hrs but the pay is over permitted work rules and i am still on the old system so i thought i could do a deal with dwp about it lol idk, idk if i can risk losing my benefit money like that. job sounds really cool though"
174374109,Fanapt is fairly free of side effects.
176126181,She said she accepted me for who I was. Turn out she accepted me for what I had. Also she was a unhappy camper and nobody could change that.
176126182,"Without my APs I lose my insight and wind up in the hospital. That would leave me unable to work, pay for mortgages, maintain my relationships with my wife, daughter, etc. A med-compliant life is less stressful and more enjoyable. Trying to go med-free invariably winds up as hell on Earth."
176126183,"I think the hardest part would be that you’ll likely have to not ever tell anyone. Like, you can’t talk to a patient and be like, oh, I totally understand, I’m sz and have been there myself. Like, you’ll have to keep it secret and that would be really difficult sometimes."
176126184,_PERSON_ maybe different variables in ones life. If you’re more stressed one day for example it may not be as effective as on a calm day

176126190,What can you eat?
176126191,_AT_MENTION_ what was it like? I’m afraid it’s going to make me relive my trauma again
176126192,"Idk what lofty means but it sounds negative. I think it’s fun myself, no sarcasm. For me. Cos you can learn about things and discover things that can help many ppl. Main problem is pressure. And fact that psychosis exists."
176126193,"Because of Lithium, I have to take Synthroid too now. Socks. And it didn’t help me in the slightest either."
176126194,thank you i m really happy i am not alone hope you best of everything
176126195,"Changing my diagnosis from schizophrena to bipolar and now unofficially to anxiety (as my psychiatrist suspects this is what I have)… Its not made any difference to my symptoms I still struggle the same… The truth is althogh I cannot go back to work because of the coronavirus situation and want to keep my family safe, the other reason is I frankly don’t want to go in I can’t face the humiliation. I blamed my manager for trying to kick me out of my job to another co-worker. I spoke to my manager before I left work and said I am feeling very paranoid and it’s not fair on anyone i stay there… I said I’d be back when I am better… I feel absolutely guilty for what i had done and gossip goes everywhere. I even thought one of my other colleague was trying to pick on me… Ok yes I am sensative, other peoples opinions matter… possibly a social anxiety element to it all… I don’t want to go in to work I want to quit like I have quit every single job I have had."
176126196,You’re wrong _AT_MENTION_ . They take HUGE doses.
176126197,"Deep calm breathing, relaxing muscles and focusing on things I can see, hear, smell and touch."

176126199,"The brain doesn’t have physical regenerative powers, in that it can’t produce new cells, but we use so little of our brains that I am sure other parts can take over when one part is damaged. I think we have something like100 trillion neurons in our brain. That leaves a lot of room to recover lost abilities."
176126200,What about you _AT_MENTION_ do you get faint voices like me? Or are they clear sometimes?
176126201,my dream girl is so close yet out of reach the staff at my clubhouse said we are all not allowed to be friends we are ‘colleagues’ apparently i really hate all that red tape
176126202,Yes I know that but I can see how many people it worked for a the side effects I could see
176126203,"I experienced the same thing while studying in university. It hurt my grades a lot. I feel everyone on earth is watching me even when pleasuring myself and I get negative voices while studying like you’re stupid, junky, useless, coward, you don’t deserve studying, studying is cheating, people are better than you and will beat you no matter how much you study etc Very insulting and disturbing voices. I know its very hard but I still managed to barely pass my remaining courses and get a degree in physiotherapy. I would have been accepted in medicine with my preSZ grades if I didn’t had those voices which was my dream."
176126204,I do a lot of some things and not enough of other things.
176126205,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176126206,Oh I see. Does it come true?
176126207,What’s graveyard? Isn’t it where you burry the dead?
174374110,"I thought family was supposed to be there as a support system. My step brother got me into heavy hard substance use when I was 18. Before that from ages 16-17 my other step brother and his wife got me into drinking and essentially brainwashed me. They created a little monster. I was a quiet, shy, but very polite kid. But I was so stupid. Not a freaking clue when it comes to people or social relations… they got me into the worst hard drug of them all. They did it when I was getting clean on my own, doing pretty well. They did it on purpose, and after I lost my mind they literally exited my life. Am I entitled? Are they like the narcisstic family structure, making me the scapegoat? Or am I the psychopath? I keep asking myself “what did I do wrong?”… I trusted my fathers first kids with the task of “raising” me. I acted so horrible that I just moved provinces to get a new start. Why did they do this though? I should’ve listened to my mother. But I’m suspicious she set them up. Shes a c
ruel woman too. The type to point in your face and laugh at your downfall. I know I acted crappy when I was in my teenage years. But she spent plenty of nights when I was in kindergarten screaming at me from the basements until 2 am. Only after begging her to let me sleep so I could wake up in time for school did she stop. (she was yelling at me for 5+ hours over my bedwetting problem which I for the life of me couldn’t get a handle on. This wasn’t unusual, but i think its excusable because she had trauma from being abused by that side of family too. I get being a single parent is challenging. .). I need to vent. But reputation is so poor now. It wasnt really me doing all this nonsense. I thought I could trust them and their views and ideas. Am I even schizophrenic or did they just make me think I was crazy? I’m scared and think they planned it all out as punishment for eventually standing up for myself. I’m sorry to everyone on here for the times I’ve acted like a stupid child."
174374111,"If you’re going to do something, do it well."
176126208,"Lol yeah sorry _AT_MENTION_ . _AT_MENTION_ when I started hearing voices in high school, a friend had a few choice words like “you’re constantly living in paranoia and denial, no one in our school likes you. So treat me with respect you mental scu m.” I still have the text on my old phone from 10yrs ago. I had to deal with a lot of unsupportive people, I’m happy I broke free from it. It’s a shame your mom distant herself away from you, but good you’re able to live without her help."
176126209,"i hope you better now… at least you found a bottle. make sure you don’t run out of meds in the future. anyways, hope you feel better"
176126210,"I’m pretty sure my family has no idea I come on here… and even if they did, I wouldn’t care. I like it on here. I find it therapeutic."
176126211,Is that not a last resort if other medications don’t work?
176126212,I hope the new meds will bring you some peace.
176126213,"I’ve seen some good artists, musicians, poets on the forum. I was unusually talented in sports growing up with basketball & baseball. What’s your talent?"

176126215,What’s sth? 151
174374116,Mine just kept telling me to buy different psychology work books. Well what she didn’t factor in is I have avolition so I’d want to read it but never end up doing anything in them. So that didn’t work ?
176126216,Definitely mention it. If it’s TD you might need a med change. But here’s hoping it’s not TD. I have a strange tick myself. Every so often I’ll spontaneously make the rock/metal hand gesture. But I’ve been doing it for years. Once every few days. It’s just my fingers that move.

For sure I’m disabled, but I don’t see myself as being ‘severely functionally impaired’ . I also have doubts over being described as ‘vulnerable’ .

176126219,Why am I troubled in your opinion?
176126220,What does it mean to blank someone out? I dont know the expression…
176126221,I just keep thinking that I need to be punished. People are out to get me. I continue to tear out my skin and I don’t know why I want to keep doing it. I might just sleep and see if I feel better- maybe I’m just feeling really ill. I’m just so awfully tired and worn out lately from my MD and from the hallucinations and I just…can’t. Like I can’t do this. It’s just so hard. I feel like I’m melting away and I can’t understand why I’m hurting so much. What if there is a demon sleeping inside of me and I’m just a burden that needs to be erased? I don’t know. Like I just can’t.
176126222,Yeah I have considered pursuing mental health peer work. At times I feel it’s a reachable goal but then I lose faith in myself and my capabilities.
176126223,That’s awful chordy!!! You’re safe now though right
176126224,"Im having some anxiety and paranoid thoughts today, I dont want to have a anxiety attack, how can i again control my mind again."
176126225,Great poem _AT_MENTION_! I like to believe that we are all going to be okay. At least for sure we could always be worse or more tormented than we are. Good energy and positive vibes help keep the hope alive for me.
176126226,"I know its hard to believe but no. But I get it, I freaked out at my neighbors one day and ended up in the hospital because I thought they were spying on me and had a live feed of me on the internet. Why would anyone watch you on their phone, can you think of a particular reason?"
174374115,I learned that with this illness you’ve got to take things slow. If you rush you will end up tripping and then falling. One step at a time.

176126241,Music in the shower encourages me to shower once every week. I use a big JBL bluetooth speaker. Maybe try that?
176126242,in your opinion is it a lot or a little?
176126243,"That’s really quality advice! You’d put my therapist out of a job, in a good way. Even though things are ok now, I kind of have dark thoughts whenever left alone in the house, especially at night. Surprises haven’t stopped since I got this illness, so I’m sure I’ll be hit by something good or bad, big or small. I hope you do the same!"

176126245,61 and feel like in my 70’s with my arthritis hurting all the time.
176126246,I guarantee there’s no conspiracy I used to think the same thing. I have been stable and normal waiting in the hospital for my psychiatry appointment and I’ve seen suspicious sounding schizophrenics. They all believe the same thing. It’s a delusion. Do you see a therapist? That’s what really helped me. It’s nonsense there’s no conspiracy trust me.
176126247,I suffer from bad anxiety and depression on a daily basis. I try to concentrate on the forum and TV as much as possible to take my mind off my troubles. Sometimes I wonder if I should try living in adult foster care somewhere.

174374117,"Improvements so far: Positive symptoms are 95% gone, just occasional intrusive or unusual thoughts Motivation issues mostly gone.

Able to feel more strongly about music and art, and find more beauty in the scenery and develop a cultural appreciation on my trip to China Speech is better. I’m talking more in support groups and writing more clearly here on this website. One counselor at day treatment was shocked like “wow” when I opened my mouth after amyloban. Effects are more noticeable combined with an energy drink or coffee Anxiety and nausea from meds are mostly gone Downsides: I’m a little groggy in the morning and I tire easily. I can’t walk around all day like a traveling backpacker anymore I am currently taking 4 pills per day. I wonder if I will improve further if I take more… but I’m maxed out on tiredness. I’m qu
ite ok right now aside from low concentration, low energy, and poor memory. I’m also much happier. I enjoyed this trip to China a lot and was able to do most of the things I wanted."
176126249,Me too. Can’t sleep since midnight. You could turn everything off and just lay down and relax. Sometimes I fall asleep like that.
176126250,"I tend to blame people for a lot of my problems in general, but when I recognise this, the blame usually always shifts to myself."
176126251,Yoga? A walk? Danceable music? A bath? A shower? Have you taken your meds if you’re supposed to be taking any?
176126252,"The only studies I’ve seen where CBD has been effective for weight loss is where very high and expensive doses were injected into the test subjects (rodents). When it comes to low-dose consumables, there’s really nothing show it to be effective at all with weight loss. Indeed, it increased appetite in many of the subjects. The best way to lose weight is slow and steady, no more than three pounds per week, and through a combination of improved diet (eat less high calorie crap and more whole/wholesome foods) and more exercise, even daily walks. Hope this helps."
176126253,"I’m so proud of you! _AT_MENTION_ But I have no money! My treatment team tells me I can’t work, and I’m not yet approved for disability!"

176126261,I like it _AT_MENTION_! Here’s my poem: I don’t work Money can be sparse If you don’t like it Than kiss me arse.
176126262,I think the only way to be cured is to live alone in a gigantic plastic ball with a Keurig and a food replicator in the middle of the ocean free of stress and triggers. So far I haven’t been able to create that kind of environment and I would probably just end up eating the ball. In real life I couldn’t survive without treatment.
176126263,Just because I’m a woman does not make it ok to label me Bipolar
174374126,"Please keep in mind everyone can experience different meds different ways. No one can tell you how you will react. Different doses are also able to give different results. I hated invega at a low dose. Higher helped, though i have sedation and lack of motivation as side effects. But i have no positive symptoms. You have to try a med before you know if it is for you."

He’s trying to claim me… making me become evil but I’m not…I’m not… Maybe take 200mg amisulpride instead of 100mg. … maybe it can help after all… otherwise alien will possess me and use me for his purposes. I don’t want to be his hands and eyes. I can’t look in the mirror for fear of seeing him. Am I psychotic?"

176126276,The only medicine that made me feel like a zombie was Seroquel. My psychosis felt like a drug trip as well. Parts of it were wacky and fun. Life’s a lot more boring now that I am not psychotic. Like as in uneventful.
176126277,"I’m damned tired of the corona. In my country, denmark, everyone are together fighting the pandemic, it’s good that people are joining the “big community” together, singing, and making statements. I know all that, but it makes me feel more alone than ever."

I ate every one of those candy bars. When he found out he yelled at me, “You ate seven-teen candy bars!” Then we went to the pizza place, and he got onto an involved conversation on the phone.

I was eating fried foods a couple times a week so I am trying to stop eating fried foods for a while to see if that will help me lose weight. I was 55 kg when I moved away from my x boyfriend and was a meat eater and before I moved I was 53kg. Now I’m almost 62kg and w 160cm but My way of viewing bodies has changed. When I was younger I would think someone was fat if they were not slim. Now I have a crush on a overweight woman and I see people at the gym in all shapes and sizes. Some people at the gym are even obese but they are fit and they are all so gorgeous. I have started to see you can e beautiful in all shapes n sizes and you can be fat n fit n even healthy. One girl at the gym looks a little on the fat side but she is soooo fit n strong n gorgeous. Our instructor is a bit 
fat because she loves her food she confessed. We can be happy angvhealthy and gorgeous and fit even as overweight. I was 53 kkg when 55 kg

I could not help but compare the two. The men were not as happy. Don’t forget, the draft still existed then and it was before the large scale rebellion against the war in Vietnam. I’m sure the only reason the women seemed happier than the men was because of the prevailing idea that males are only soldier meat and there might be little future for them. I mean who can be happy with that? Progress has been made but we’re still far from seeing that war is not an option to civilized people."

176126423,"This basically. I’ve been doing it for 5 months and my treatment team keep saying that it’s just anxiety and will get better but it hasn’t. I fantasise about having an accident on the way to work so I don’t have to go in. I work in a shop doing the stock and deliveries so it’s quite physical and my back and knees are in agony since starting and I’ve had to start taking tramadol for what they suspect is arthritis (have xray booked). I dread the pain every time I go to work. The tramadol only slightly takes the edge of it. I live in a very rural area so it’s very limited in terms of jobs, otherwise I’d try a different one. What do I do? This is making me so miserable."

176126446,"I strongly doubt anyone is messing with you purposefully. Listen to how the thought makes you feel. If it makes you afraid and distrustful it likely is a delusion. In general with delusions I find the more afraid or agitated I feel the more likely it is to be a scared thought leading to a delusional thought. When I am calm and my thoughts are clear it is easier to trust my judgment. This is true in most cases. Most people are trustworthy, and it sounds like these people are trying to soothe your fears. They sound like good people. It helps to be sceptical of your thoughts and question the truth of them as much as you can especially if you feel agitated or very frightened. Mood follows thought. One negative thought can change your whole mood. One positive thought can do the same."

174374193,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Levels of distress tolerance in schizophrenia appear equivalent to those found in borderline personality disorder. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of clinical psychologyREFERENCES, Feb 2020 18 Distress tolerance is an important but understudied construct for those with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. This study compared levels of distress tolerance between people diagnosed with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder (BPD) to better characterize distress tolerance in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.Using cross-sectional data, we examined group differences in distress tolerance in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (n?=?55) and BPD (n?=?32) through mean comparison and equivalence analyses.Our results indicate that, in our data, distress tolerance did not differ between those with schizophrenia and those with BPD, and was in fact statistically equivalent between groups. In contrast, those with BPD tended to report more difficulty on some aspects of emotion regul
ation.Findings from this study suggest that increased focus on distress tolerance is called for in research on schizophrenia. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders may benefit from interventions targeting distress tolerance."

176126539,"I remember when I was a child up to when I was around 12 years old I could “see” ghosts and tell what they were doing. I also had a hallucination for most of my life until I was 18 about a figure I called shadow that would help me in dealing with life. It didn’t really use a voice to speak but it telepathically communicated with me through feelings and symbols. To this day I dont know if he was a hallucination or not, BUT anyway… Before my first psychosis I was actually living a normal but crazy teenaged life like most young adults do. It wasnt until my psychosis which was drug induced by ecstasy I had it. The multiple psychoses lasted until I was about… 26 years old. Thinking back on it now, though, I was able to tolerate life easier before the psychosis even with depression waning and waxing. I think the main reason why I am still pushing forward is because I remember what it was like to be normal."

I experience a lot of these odd coincidences, but I finally let go of the idea that there was any significance to them. It put me in a bit of an odd position to apparently have my delusion confirmed. But perhaps it was a misunderstanding as you say."

So, drinking just under seven 175ml glasses of 12% rosé, in a week, will take you over these guidelines.

He broke up with me recently and I was having questions in my mind about my bf that i thought another male sz might be able to answer or give me some insight about. For starters, do you think it’s not uncommon for a depressed sz guy to break up with his gf due to his mental illness symptoms and relationship stress? That might sound like a silly question. I’m not sure what I want to know… If a sz guy is sort of paranoid or having bad thoughts where voices or thoughts are making him think his gf is cheating or doesn’t care about him, might be break up with that girlfriend because of that?

And if that were the case, you won’t be open to answers that don’t relieve that anxiety or provide comfort. And you seemed to prove that was the basis when you didn’t like my response because it wasn’t exactly black or white. My basis for how I think is that black or white thinking is dangerous and only offered you to consider to be more open. Because if the basis for thinking is, “I need to avoid anxiety” then what you allow into your sphere of open opinions is limited to that. Don’t you think? Then, you got offended because you assumed that I ‘belittled’ anxiety and mental health and shrugged me off as ‘ignorant’. I can assume by that use of the word, you’re meaning ‘rude’ which is a matter of perspective relative to values. I could not see that my responses are rude or ignorant and it could be it’s you based on my perspective. I

174374228,"Brain & Behavior Research Foundation – 30 Jun 19 RESEARCH FOR RECOVERY: Advances in Cognitive Remediation: ‘Helping... Progress in research usually doesn’t follow a straight-line path. But if you chart the advances in schizophrenia research made by _NAME_ A_PERSON_ Light, Ph.D. since he received his first BBRF grant—a Young Investigator Award in 2003—you can clearly see... The study involved 46 participants living with chronic, severe schizophrenia who were receiving state-mandated care in a locked facility 30 miles east of San _NAME_. “For too long, it has been thought that the neural systems in schizophrenia are fixed, that they can’t be modified—and that the best one can hope for is to manage psychotic symptoms,” he says. “But now we’re learning that cognition itself is remediable and that recovery is a possibility.” [Dr. Light & Drs. _NAME_ and _NAME_] had a theory that the disabling deficits in cognitive function seen in people with schizophrenia are caused, at least in 
part, by problems receiving or analyzing signals that enter the brain through the senses. Perhaps the brain’s auditory and frontal cortices, for instance, were not processing sounds properly. In the most recent test, in the facility outside San _NAME_ where he tested TCT in medicated patients with longstanding, chronic illness, not only did TCT provide a real, measurable benefit to two-thirds of these patients in the form of improved results on cognitive tests. The research also demonstrated that MMN measured after the very first hour of training accurately predicted which patients were going to benefit from the full 4-week program. This was confirmed once the training course was completed. Dr. Light and colleagues still are not sure why some respond to TCT and others do not, but they speculate that MMN and possibly other measures of brain activity (one is called auditory steady-state response) are able to show which patients have sufficient plasticity in their neural circuitry to benefit from this particul
ar type of training—which, in essence, is a form of learning. Plasticity refers to the ability of neurons to adjust the strength of their connections. Neuroscientists have long understood that such adjustments are part of the mechanical basis of memory and learning. TCT, the training method recently used by Dr. Light, is itself not revolutionary, he says. His team used a commercially available “brain-training” software program that worked perfectly well. Other programs might also work well, he says. In TCT, auditory exercises are delivered to each patient for 3 to 5 hours weekly, via computer. The patient is asked to make progressively finer discriminations of sounds, beginning with comparatively easy discriminations and steadily moving to harder choices—but only after correct answers have been delivered. “If they get it right, it gets harder; if they make a mistake they go back to where they were challenged. They are constantly being pressed up against their ability level.”"

176126615,"WebMD Creative Genius Linked to Mental Illness Is There Truth Behind the Mad Genius Stereotype? May 24, 2002 – From _NAME_ to _NAME_, the path from mental illness to creative genius has been well traveled by many artists and writers. Now, researchers say they are gaining new clues about the mysterious link between highly creative individuals and mental disorders, such as manic depression. A new study shows that healthy artists are more similar in personality to people with manic depression than other healthy people in the population. Researchers presented the findings this week at the American Psychiatric Association Meeting in Philadelphia. The National Institute on Mental Health estimates that manic depression, also called bipolar disorder, affects about 2 million Americans. The brain disorder is characterized by unusual and often dramatic shifts in a person’s energy level and mood far different than the typical “ups and downs.” Manic depression causes striking mood swings – from overly 
“high” to sad and hopeless, and then back again, often with periods of normal mood in between. Major changes in behavior and energy go along with these changes in mood. The periods of highs and lows are called episodes of mania and depression. “My hunch is that emotional range, having an emotional broadband, is the bipolar patient’s advantage,” says study author _NAME_ Strong, a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, in a news release. “It isn’t the only thing going on, but something gives people with manic depression an edge, and I think it’s emotional range.” Researchers say the study is unique because it compared both healthy, creative people to similarly matched people from the general population, as well as to individuals diagnosed with a mental illness. Using standard personality, temperament, and creativity tests, researchers analyzed four different groups: 47 healthy individuals, 48 patients with successfully treated bipolar disorder, 25 patients successfully treated for depressi
on, and 32 healthy graduate students enrolled in creative programs such as product design, creative writing, and fine arts. The study found people in the creative group and recovered manic depressives were more open and likely to be moody and neurotic than other healthy individuals. Researchers say these traits are part of a group of characteristics known as “negative-affective traits” that also include mild forms of depression and bipolar disorder that do not necessarily require treatment. -->"

176126667,he thinks he is supporting me through his taxes…he resents me alot…bad mouths me and never talks to me other than a frosty hello when we have to meet at family gatherings…not a word beyond that yeah and now i hear he bad mouths me about me receiving 200 euros a week off the government to support me while i put up with this extremely difficult illness…he thinks he is suppporting me…we never talk due to his very judgemental attitude
176126668,"A lot of the time they dont even know it is happening. They just think oh those deamons are after me way more than they usually are, or the men that follow you have been doing it more frequently. The whole idea of unusual beliefs are that you dont think there is anything wrong with them."
176126669,"I always wished I had a sister or two. I think I would of been able to take a lot from being a brother. Alas it never happened for me, only child, I’ll have no siblings to grow old with, no precious times spent… Treasure them while you can, and try not to annoy them to much, as much fun as that may be. I’m envious. Happy thanksgiving _NAME_!"
176126670,"Im confused. I told him thanks, but i dont feel comfortable with the ride, it is fine. I didnt cancel yet, because i was thinking what to say. He says im exaggerating, he isnt a harrasser, he surely wont touch me (he said the same sevetal times last time), it is no problem for him to bring me home. I dont take the ride, but im really confused what to think."
176126671,"What I didn’t like about thought broadcasting was that it challenges the underlying assumptions of Freudian psychology, like in Civilization and its Discontents."
176126672,"_AT_MENTION_ I am not angry with you. Your pattern on this thread is to add to the words being said. It was candy, not a pistol. I can confront my husband, I don’t have to leave him. I gave you a response, I didn’t beat you. You said I treated you like your opinions don’t matter, but in reality, I’m engaging in conversation with you to hear your words and your perspective. You said I went off, but actually what I did was write back and not agree with your words. And now, you are saying _AT_MENTION_ and I are angry with you, when neither of us said that. I wanted to hear your motive. I trust that you are seeking to be helpful. It is a skill to address the words said and speak accurately. What are some other things you could tell or ask someone who is going to binge?"
174374253,Oh I’m glad the Abilify is working for you. A lot of people find great success with that medicine.
176126673,"I had a good day at day treatment Found some cds to try from the library Didn’t spend much money though I had the whole day to walk around outside Had a good smoothie for dinner But on the downside, due to traffic and delays I didn’t get home till 8 pm and it is a little too much for me since I’ve been out and running since 7:30am… I have nausea and a headache and I really need a hot shower and some lotion and call it a night. It’s bad for me when I overexert myself."
176126674,So now that I’ve established my premise of my album. And organized it. I’m using most of the 40+ poems I wrote in the hospital to make an album. I’ll only post this album in this thread. Instead of posting a new song every time. I’ll just update the album. My last thread on my music for a while. I’ll tell ya I read a book on writing hip hop in the hospital and it really helped me a lot. I think it’s dope finally. When you got it you got. When you don’t you don’t. _AT_MENTION_ @ anyone else give me a beat I got a buncha poems left. Nice on the ears. But I still make songs I don’t like. Just know when to scratch it. It’s usually when the concept of the song. The beat w/ the lyrics don’t work together where I run into problems. And that’s inevitable with the way I’m making it.
176126675,"Sounds like you are doing really well. Good on you. Good stuff! Getting better with age. I’m better person with age too since I quit smoking, quit alcohol etc"
176126676,Has Anyone in Thus Thread Ever Went Ice Fishing in a Pond Before (???).
176126677,Correct. You’ve presented a logical fallacy. They’re both going to be honest. Any thoughts on what my original post described or what I asked?
176126678,"I feel perfectionism and insecurity are closely related. In a form I pity them, having this insatiable hunger for the perfect life that they can never truly have. Even worse so when they judge others for not living up to their standards, I will agree it can go into bully territory."
176126679,I’m afraid all the time especially when I get triggered or post my thoughts here or on youtube or just generally online or when I talk about my delusions. I’m sort of used to it. Not necessarily numb from it. I still feel the emotions it’s just dulled a bit and I have my faith and sort of accepted my fate.
174374250,"Making hell bearable with meditation helps me greatly, but nevertheless I am in my own, personal and unique hell taking away sz altogether. My conscience is now clear knowing I never had full autonomy. Still those plagued with voices, madness, delusion and persecution, let alone avolition and negative connotations of schizophrenia lead me to believe that although we can mask it with momentary happiness underneath it all plays a hellish backdrop."
176126680,this is insane…
176126681,if u havent had positives u respond well to meds and should not relapse unless you stop the meds or add something into the mix that triggers psychosis
176126682,"I think I had to get blood draws to check liver function on depakote. I lost a ton of weight on topomax, all I would eat was steak. I’m on lamictal now and it gives me no side effects."
176126683,"I get voices like that happen often when I exercise It’s not a single voice, just in the pool every time my head was above water people were calling me fat At the minute I go past people calling out that the ground shakes when I cycle I’m having full conversations of nearby people discussing me and how fat I am The age thing will soon follow I’m sure I’m getting sensitive about my age I don’t know what to say Daily fat taunts I was very used to when swimming But this feels closer to paranoia lately I hope it passes for you When people really put me down because they see me as less, this can be worse than anything… but that is more rare Few people are actually see you next Tuesday about perceived lessers when just going about in public Most of this stuff isn’t real Persecution is not just something we fear and hear It can be real But it helps when we know it isn’t real on whatever level"
176126684,yes totally _AT_MENTION_ did you see this picture of ducks also from Sweden
176126685,I am trying to leave but they said they’d call the police
176126686,"The way I perceive sexuality is a combination between nature, genetic factors, and nurture, experiences. Schizophrenia screws with your perception of reality and reality could involve your sexuality or your emotions, so maybe, but maybe not. If there is a moment between the the chaos of the mind, maybe on meds, and you still feel you are gay. Then perhaps that feeling is to be trusted and respected."
176126687,"Yes they did. Feeling completely normal now, except for a little sedated from the Olanzapine"
176126688,"I do the same as you Cotton. I write quite a few similar threads. Simply because I have similar topics running through my head so I like to continue discussions with a slight difference to the topic. Not sure if that is what you do, I haven’t been keeping up with all the threads."
176126689,"Back in 2016, I got 5250’d. I was attacked by several low altitude flying saucers that attacked my brain with AI or psychotronics or some ????????. Whether it was aliens or military, I don’t know. Probably aliens. I started threatening my family, which wasn’t typical of me because of the alien close encounter or possibly semi-alien abduction. It’s not fair to me but it probably was a good thing I had a 15 day stay. I was good and did my time and everything was great. I was in the secure unit and felt safe. I was honestly scared with the whole thing and going to the public hospital and stuff. But the police were really nice and respectful to me. You could tell they had training. Maybe I was fortunate or lucky. I hope to never experience such things again. Maybe I was off meds too because it was after my NMS and ICU thing and the doctors told me to stay off meds for a while. I ended up back on them. It was the perfect storm: no meds and alien encounter, unfortunately. Nobody believes me but I 
know what I saw. I take full responsibility for what I said and my actions, but I do felt it was a result of fear and being scared and ????. Thank you."
176126690,"_AT_MENTION_ you’re an amazing woman who’s been through so much and you are beautiful and shiny from the inside and out, don’t doubt yourself now when you need yourself the most."
176126691,"When I worked FT doing data entry, I drank 5 bags of tea per day. Then I just collapsed on the weekends and spent 2 days in bed, then started over. It eventually got too much for me, I had no time for anything besides work. I had to quit."
176126692,"This was what I was advised to do on Latuda a few years ago by a pharmacist, but the pdoc disagreed and changed my med instead. _AT_MENTION_ - Haldol can be very effective even at a much lower dose, so you may be able to try and find the sweet spot and hopefully manage your side effects better . My anxiety was solved by Pregabalin, which they prefer over Benzos. I still am allowed to have 20mg of Diazepam a day as well, but I have built up tolerance to it., and I don’t think it does anything now."
176126693,"C An people really find your GPS coordinates from a picture you post? I was watching dont fck with cats, and they found this guys address from some pictures he posted"
174374247,I am scared of withdrawal effect if I stop taking abilify that’s why scared to touch antis psychotics. At least now I don’t have any positive symptoms.
176126694,"Make sure you stay there, it’s far better than being on the streets. Don’t run away or escape. I tried that and I’m not cut out for it, I don’t think you are either. Engage in the help you receive; make all the art, do the therapy, try and get better. Please"
176126695,I don’t remember it. I haven’t seen it in a while. I like the song.

174374265,"Psychiatry Advisor – 18 Dec 20 Hallucination Symptom of Schizophrenia Associated With Heart Rate-Adjusted... Interoceptive accuracy was lower among patients with schizophrenia than in healthy controls even after controlling for age, sex, anxiety, depression, etc. I don’t have a clue what any of this means."
176126702,What’s so sickening is that behind all this is fear. I could do without fear. It gets in the way of living.
176126703,I hope so but im unsure.

174374257,"Do you know any books on how to deal with the ego and narcissism of people? I was thinking here that if we can find strategies on how to persuade people to accept us and to help us. _NAME_, for example, has a huge crowd of followers. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia."

176126709,I don’t think I’ll have any friends in my life. I’m convinced that I’ll be alone and I’m scared of people.
176126710,"I put frankincense essential oil in my diffuser all the time. I also think it’s an ingredient in some skin care type stuff of mine. Don’t think it does anything for my anxiety, but it smells nice."
174374248,"man,i wish i can get something like ritalin or drugs in genral for adhd,but nah unfortunately its very to get it here in australia or get a psychiatrist to prescribe it specially for if they know you have schizoprenia or depression or something like that."
176126711,I shower every day too. I was brought up with daily showers and always showered daily (even when I lived in my car for three weeks)(except for when I was psychotic). But I stopped showering daily when I lived in south Australia but when I moved interstate to live with family and they noticed I wasn’t showering every day they /she told me to shower every day.so I did. Now I shower every day. I used to adore showers and sometimes when I was psychotic I would find the water comforting and I had long showers then. I still adore showers but it can depend on the shower. I used to wash my hair every day but now I only wash it 2-3 times a week.
176126712,I feel at peace mostly since i decided to take my life. A huge weight has been lifted
176126713,The trouble we are having out here points that things are amiss with the climate. Whether you believe it or not having once in a lifetime weather events every five years isn’t cool. Solar = no sex? Plenty of sex in the world regardless. Petrol is about monopoly and a select few dictating price but look into diamonds. It’s an artificial construct like paper money. We all accept this. Not sure your point. I like ents though. Tree herds would save us having to stop deforestation. They could take on the bulldozers and make lawn sculptures for the culturally elite.
176126714,Yeah hearing that. They pushed us into university and I failed but worked in the trades. For years I was a vehicle accessory fitter. Just simple jobs so no papers but fitted stuff to cars. You needed some skills and I learned to love working with my hands. I agree with you. It’s too late for me now but if I was forced to work I’d go work for my brother who’se a painter. He makes good coin and it’s hard work but I like that! Working hard for a living physically is a good thing in my book and trades are great if you get the certificates!
176126715,"I was freaking out as I am very self-conscious of my weight Even though it’s supposedly healthy, with all these meds I need to keep an eye on it. Pretty obsessive about it to be honest. Might be a problem"
176126716,I know when my monthly is coming. I get acne. I eat everything in my kitchen and my sza symptoms get worse. Oh and I get lots of energy. I hate my period. I can wear a pad the size of a friggin boat and I still manage to leak. My sister lives with me now and we have our periods at the same time.
176126717,"They are determined to deliberately misinterpret anything I say, think, or do in a negative light because they are pathetic. They’ll put words in my mouth, outright lie about me, and say things that bear no relationship to reality—just their obsessed reality that they construct from scant evidence like a conspiracy theory for everything that I am."

176126723,Maybe because all people have at least some control over their mind?
176126724,Yes I swear it kind of sounded human but not completely. I do believe in ghosts. My Mom passed away in the house in 2019. Or maybe it was a auditory hallucination and I’m wondering if I should tell my pdoc?

174374254,Establishing the right pattern of sleeping. Any sleep hygiene article I’ve ever read says to go to bed and get up in the morning at roughly the same time every night. My sleep pattern isn’t the best either. Articles on schizophrenia will occasionally recommend getting enough quality sleep too. You can start making a conscious effort to go to bed the same time every night. Once you start doing it for awhile it will become a habit.
176126728,_AT_MENTION_ what is your current weight?
176126729,"I was a sex worker for a little while, It was a way to make some quick cash. There are risks I was willing to take, just like some other jobs. That being said the industry has a dark side, trafficking, forced, drugs, crime. I can see why it’s illegal, trying to control the industry is like trying to control a monster"
176126730,"You’ll be fine. Take deep, slow breaths and imagine yourself in a happy place. Calm your mind."
176126731,Yes! I agree totally. I had a good upbringing. No money but lots of love. You have love in your relationships you do well in life for sure. Starts with yourself. Love yourself first and that takes a lot of doing for a sz person!

She called late last night and said the neighbor over where she is staying has Corona Virus and she may have been exposed. If that’s true, she needs to stay away from here, my ex is at risk.

174374260,I just ordered Sarcosine from ebay china about 20$ for 250g but I just read that 2 grams is toxic: Toxicity Motor impairment and respiratory issues have been observed in rats at 10mg/kg. This equates to 800mg for an 80kg person. Now I am scared to take it. Did anyone experience side effects from 2 to 4g of sarcosine? I was on glycine 60g but it gave me nausea and sometimes I had to vomit. I was able to work when on glycine but now can’t since I stopped taking it.
176126760,Yeah it gets to everyone but your not alone. I’d help anyways I can but be straight with me and I can help better. I’m just a soon to be old dude who tries to get some love out there… It bites to me too a lot of the time but we get there in the end.

It’s to the point that I became co-dependent on the voices for everything like: what is the wrong answer, does this person like me, should I wear this, should I do that, what does the future hold and when will I die. I’m in denial to some extent. I believe they are simply my thoughts…I hear them as voices of something else.

I always assume that people are treating me badly and don’t trust people to be good to me. Especially when I first meet people and I can be quiet upfront because of it and I think they judge me on things like how I look. I only trust a close few friends and family and maybe a couple of people at work, apart from that I don’t really trust anyone about how they treat me."

176126808,"If I had not met my wife in the early autumn of 1982, while we were both psych patients,things would have been very different. At the time nobody really believed in me, be they my family or psych professionals. I was regarded as a chronic schizophrenic. The best envisioned for me was life in a group home. The worst envisioned was a long stay ward. On March 1983 my later to be wife and I left hospital together. The talk was I’d be back in within 6 weeks. Nearly 38 years later and no further hospitalisations. Am I a resounding success story ?- not really,except in comparison to how things could’ve been . I’ve never been employed, but do my best to help people in the way I’m best able to.

More veggies is healthy anyway."

As a result, parent caregivers spend vast amounts of time providing care, which necessitates changes to their relationships and lives. In this qualitative study, the experiences of parent caregivers for adult children with schizophrenia were explored. Interpretive Description guided the study design, and data were collected through interviews with 12 English-speaking participants. Data were analyzed according to conventional content analysis. The themes ""Uncertainty, Change, and Challenges"" and ""The Meaning of It All"" help to articulate the participants' experiences. Overall, the participants reported tremendous distress in their roles. This was compounded by difficulties accessing and navigating the healthcare system and 
interactions with police. Effective strategies are needed to help parent caregivers cope within their role and gain access to timely and appropriate care."

174374304,Most of the people with autism that I’ve met didn’t have it develop into SZ. I’m the only one I’ve met IRL this has happened to. Not that I’ve noticed.
174374296,"Thanks for the feedback. To be fair, I don’t think I’m delusional about ‘something’ happening to me in college aka ‘how I ended up with schizophrenia’. I think it was deliberate. I watch or reinforce ideas per se because it clarifies and makes sense to me because I believe I was abducted by some aliens/military craft and in 2016 I saw them again. I got really sick in 2016 again. I watch what I watch because I think it will help me understand or educate myself to what happened to me and why. I have missing time I think. Or memory loss/amnesia around the time I got schizophrenia in college. When I first got sick, I thought I had a NDE or religious experience initially. Then I started questioning things because I never hallucinated or heard voices – ever. Nobody ever listened to me either including family or doctors. They all seemed fishy. Right out of the _NAME_ Show, I guess. Even online. By definition a delusion is something you believe in contrary to evidence. I do have some evidence 
though. I worry about my safety so I don’t know what else to say. Maybe it was solely just aliens and not the government? I don’t know. Mine was very negative. Maybe I’ll never get the answers and help and closure I want. I told my dad money would be nice because I remember being taken from my room but I know that will never happen and I rather just be alone. I feel messed up and wronged and hurt and ?????? up in the head and left hanging. I can’t even function and I believe I got serious trauma. I’m putting the pieces back together again. I’ve been wrong before, but I know I’m making progress in understanding things. Regarding IQ and complex delusions. The average IQ or average intellect is 100. Mine is above that and my doctor said my paranoid delusions signified high intelligence although her estimate of my IQ was somewhat insulting. I don’t even trust her. She said she was the smartest or one of the smartest doctors from her country before she immigrated here. So there’s that… I guess 
I could keep it chill and be cool and I think I have improved over the years being on this forum. I feel like I’m the only one that knows the truth. I’m glad I am somewhat liked here and I am glad most people are cool. Thank you."

Also knowing what triggered it and whats the real issue helps to bribg me back to reality. E.g. the real issue is i did something i felt bad about, so i feel guilty. My mind always makes that into “so you will go to hell!”. But in reality i just feel guilty and should solve the real issue. And making myself FEEL more comfortable. With relaxing music, comfy blanket, etc."

174374311,"First,I want to tell you that I found many articles that are correlated between auto immune factors and development and remission factors in schizophrenia.Also many articles about correlation between mothers infections during pregnancy on development in child’s schizophrenia as adult ,role of antipsychotics medicaments and levels of cytokines of each medication(aripiprazole,risperidone,clozapine,quetiapine etc). If you want me to collect all the articles and publish it on here from journals of psychiatry let me know with likes on this subject,because some of them are hard to found and some are too big to be published here. Who likes to read about that area give me like so I can continue.I found inspiration in my psychiatrist who works in Clinic of Psychiatry in Belgrade has published,so I read further more."

176126932,I can only drive to my pdr 5-10 min from my house. Anything more and I get lost and do accidents. When my SZ symptoms started at 18 y.o. I had one deadly accident where my car flipped in the air and landed on its top. I got out of the broken window. I felt I am in a movie. The police told me to get a lotto ticket bcz I am one of the luckiest on earth to be alive bcz I was going at over 140kmh on the highway and my car slided on ice in winter.
176126933,I DID IT GUYS!! I FINISHED TODAY!! I am so proud of myself. I am having icecream now!

176126935,"Hello, everyone! I hope all of you are well! As some of y’all may know, I have started taking geodon yesterday. It turns out my doctor actually prescribed me 40mg in the morning and 40mg in the evening. When I first took it I was slightly tired but didn’t need to sleep. I will say that I didn’t feel like doing anything and I was slightly confused so I slept on it, woke up in the evening and took my next round and slept some more. Right now it is 2am (I sometimes wake up at this time because I need to take my bf to work by 7am) and I actually feel like I have had the best quality sleep in a year!! With the last med I was on, Invega, I would sleep this much and still feel tired. Also, another plus is there are no voices! Holy crap! This awesome! And my depression is a bit better. Yay! Now I’m just having a few cognitive side effects such as slow reaction and difficult to recall certain things but everything else I can remember. Oh! I also was able to have REM sleep and remember my dream fully 
for the first time in a year! I’m keeping this in mind though… this could be a placebo effect as many antipsychotics I have taken have done. This med may stop working in the next two weeks like all the others I have taken. I hope not. I will keep in touch though! Thank all of you for your knowledge, experience and support through my life and yours so far!"

174374316,I tried weed 3-4 times before my sz. Sometimes I think I would be better or I would have had sz at a later age if I never tried weed. The first voices and violent behavior started with the first time I tried weed.
176126939,I don’t think anybody knows for sure and it’s possible there may never be one. It’s possible better treatment and more effective medication could be perfected.

176126950,I’m sick with a cold so I’m just gonna lay here and listen to music til I get better
176126951,Yes. I’ve been hearing voices on and off since age 9. As well as seeing shadow people. Since June this year (2019) I’ve been hearing voices but I haven’t had visual hallucinations. I usually don’t have visual hallucinations unless I’m completely off medicine. I’m supposed to start Invega _PERSON_ Wednesday so I hope that helps.
176126952,Are you sure that line made you crazy or is that just something that you remember about your father? Most parents tell their children that unless they are spanking them for doing wrong!
176126953,I’m on 3 mg. It helps me a lot. Downsides are the slowed metabolism + monstrous appetite and consequent weight gain and a feeling of slowed thinking. But I’m pretty happy with it overall.
176126954,"I cant choose. I think the traits that i had long before becoming psychotic and i dont even have words for, because they were always there. My way of experiencing the world seems just so different, that the constant adjustment already takes up most my energy and im not being very productive. Just writing a simple e-mail comes with social anxiety, fear of failure, perfectionism, overcoming procrastrination and distractions and translating from my way of perceiving (complex, detailed) to theirs (efficient, fast). I have no clue how to describe it. I hope you understand."
176126955,"I used to have frequent comments on everything I was looking at or watching. It was very frustrating. Invega _PERSON_ has made it go away, though, almost completely."

The medication does help a lot, but there still is some thoughts that it hasn’t get rid of completely. If I increase the dose to 300 mg do you think it will help? I know I should ask my pdoc about it, but I also want to know if anybody have been in the same situation and did you increase the dose of Amisulpride and did it help?"
176126960,Yeah they made me really bad

I order all my food and Im getting into debt, havent left the house in almost a week. I just have no motivation whatsoever. Pretty sure its depression. How do I get out of this?"

176126981,"How are you going _AT_MENTION_ , feeling any better today?"
174374320,The problem is that I feel very empty. I feel like I’m only living in my head and not really. did you have it that way anyway?

176126983,"_PERSON_ is rock n roll. Just like Motorhead, but better, in my humble opinion"

174374325,Different drugs affect different people differently. It’s a real crap shoot. Go on a drug review site and you’ll see an equal number of “this is my miracle drug” comments and “this drug made my life a living nightmare” comments. It takes months if not years of trial and error to find the right drug for you.
174374323,"Your best bet with current scientific research is the AP Rexulti. Which is officially researched and granted permission to be a stand-alone and as a add-on antidepressant. Then you have with anecdotal evidence Abilify. Then maybe Amisulpride, there’s a lot of research that in low dosages it’s quite effective to fight off negative symptoms. (Though Amisulpride is not available in the US and some parts of Europe but they’re working on it to still bring it to the market, at least in the Netherlands). I’m on Latuda which also has quite some antidepressant effects but it’s no wonder drug for depression because my side effects are increased negative symptoms and feeling tense all day. I saw in another thread that you use the MAOi Nardil? How’s that working out for you? I’m on the MAOi Parnate, it did get rid of suicidal ideation but the depression is still with me most of the time. I’ve fought off depression successfully with working-out intense 5 days a week but due to a medical conditio
n I’m unable to get to my own workout level therefore I’m planning to switch Latuda for Rexulti and hopefully add Mirtazapine again plus maybe Parnate."

174374339,"“About 25% of patients with schizophrenia have a condition called the deficit syndrome, defined by severe and persistent negative symptoms.” I am one of those. “Patients with schizophrenia perform poorly on tests of mental fluency and flexibility, especially word fluency (producing words belonging to a given category) and the capacity to sustain attention and shift its focus when necessary. Studies suggest that these cognitive limitations affect real-world functioning and the outcome of the illness even more than negative symptoms do.” So true for me. Harvard Health The negative symptoms of schizophrenia - Harvard Health While the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are more obvious, negative symptoms are more troubling to those with the disease, and limit their ability to function normally in the world."

If it’s prescribed correctly, I think these types of substances can help people, including kids. But there’s a lot of foul play these days with people desperate to make the grade in school that they turn to these drugs to boost performance. They’re basically legal amphetamines, so doctors really need to be more discerning when prescribing."

Do you feel a calming effect, do you had nausea from it? Maybe i’ll start to feel something now after 4 years… I was too low before… I also wonder after how much time it kicks in? In an hour or more?

But after a traumatic event as an adult, I had a major psychotic break and ended up homeless for a while."

174374348,"My mother is very controlling. She used drugs like anti depressants and eventually an AP to control my angry outbursts (with good reasons). Did I have depression before I was diagnosed? yes. Did I have anxiety? yes. But I never once experienced the positive symptoms others have described on this website. I’ve tried to come off my medication, but am thwarted every time because I start to remember all the emotional neglect and abuse from my family, which then turns me against them. To keep both me and my younger brother “doped up” and under “control” she would threaten us financially, threaten to evict us and send us to the homeless shelter or even worse involve the law in matters that were really none of their concern, but my mother finessed her skills with the law and sent us to be institutionalized several times. It is because of this fear of ending up homeless, or even worse jail. I have complied all these years to take my medication until I reach a turning point in my life where the ta
bles have turned. I’m already on my way there. I got my own apartment. Food stamps and SSI SSDI. The only problem is, my parents have authorization to manage my main source of income, which can be used to threaten me. Little do they know I’m working toward saving money to buy a car they don’t have keys too, and to also get my father too retire so I can become my own authorized rep payee. Then I would have the control necessary to break away from the games they play on me."

176127038,Years before psychosis I had a depressive break. My shrink just said it’s brain chemistry. Nothing more or less. I didn’t believe him! A long time after and some decent problems I tend to agree with you. It wasn’t my fault nor any others. It was some genetics and dumb luck…( maybe one day we’ll know the trigger. )

174374364,Hmm my PNS were indeed treatment resistant. They might be explained by a psychological comorbidity such as lack of recovery from traumatic stressful events. In my case it took a few years and a generous effort from my part (which led to a few meltdowns and lots of tears along the way) to overcome PNS. So I think they can be dealt with but not by medication alone.
176127096,that sounds like good plan. Doing something for yourself is nice =)

Am I wrong? I would be a walking pharmacy if I had a med for every symptom? Personally I am even more surprised, that on some people, the meds worked for almost everything, than the opposite (that they help partially)? Who else had to fight more by him/herself, because of this partial help? I guess we are many, no? Otherwise I am the prisoner of my head in the evenings, its really a bull**** what I have then, but i find i should be patient. Some days i am really close to be very ok, which is new for me .

I’m a bit concerned about my experience in university, because it is a Protestant school, and I will have to take religion classes. I don’t really care to listen to Protestants tell me about theology lol… But I’m trying to go into it with an open mind, and hopefully people will do the same for me. There IS a Catholic Students Organization, but I’ll have to drive off-campus for Mass. I have a trusted confessor/spiritual director, a biritual priest, who is good friends with the abbot of the monastery. My spiritual director is a man absolutely beaming with compassionate love and holiness. I

176127163,"You don’t say what med’s you’re on. There are more real alternatives when it comes to med’s today. I can sympathize with you. There have been med’s I was on that were miserable, but I’ve had good luck with Geodon and Seroquel controlling my symptoms and giving me a satisfactory life. It’s been my experience that pdoc’s tend to dig in their heels when you give them ultimatums. Figure out the best strategy to use with this pdoc to get your med’s changed. If that doesn’t work, see if you can get a new pdoc."
176127164,Yes it’s a bad time to go to the ER or Psych Hospital right now. It’s even risky for us to go to the family doctor or urgent care.

176127202,I feel as if I’ve misspoke. The fear of hallucinations returning was in regards to practicing impulsiveness. I think being mindful is a great thing. I’ve been practicing a sort of mindfulness for quite a bit of my life and I find it incredible. We all live foremost in our minds so… Why not pay attention to what’s occuring there? I recommend observing the workings of their mind to everyone.

I know if I ever caught my husband looking at porn I’d want to hurt him. It just makes me angry. Am I not enough? But if you have an addiction I guess it’s different. I have food issues so I understand addiction.
176127210,Yeah I like that… It’s like a repeating loop at times… dude don’t set expectations… just be friendly… she’s already noticed you and you know absolutely nothing about her anyway (or at least that was the case.)

176127251,When im psychotic I believe in simulation theory and so I think the world is like a mathematical equation and made by a computer. I do not blame myself for my faulty thinking. I believe in the responsibility to be the best you can going forward. But you were always doing the best you knew at that moment in the past. I think meditating can help me. Not sure about everyone of us. I have a very “whole” mind right now. In the past I had “holes” in my mind. So now its add a w in front. I may have delusions but my mind doesnt feel broken anymore. So I can probably meditate. Well in the car today I just listened to the sound of the engine and tried not to think and it helped me tonight. I really need to get the noise out of my head.

How could the radio and tv hear my thoughts? Everything around me is talking about me and talking about my thoughts. I’m tired of this.

He went through each choice with me and recommended the lowering of dose which I went with, should that not work I will choose abilify in the next six months.

176127344,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

They do not restrain themselves from abusing children, whom are endowed with glorious mythological or archetypal personalities. Instead they seek to enrapture and rape, especially young boys into their schematic of domination and “resource acquisition”. They do not limit themselves to the secular, which is only a state religion, but in their lust, blur lines that were long held as sacred. Now they want to use sorcery to enslave those that run to walls, toward the hoarders and the keepers which have surrrounded themselves with, in order to process and put our people into institutionalized incarceration and poisoning process.

176127465,"So, here’s my experience of it. Ever since I was about 6 years old, I experienced the belief that I could read or sense the thoughts of other people around me. I didn’t hear their thoughts out loud as in auditory hallucinations. But, I “knew” what their thoughts were nonetheless and these thoughts were always malicious thoughts directed towards me. They were evil, bad thoughts directed at me and they caused me untold suffering all of my life until I was around 56 years old when I was finally placed on an effective medication regimen of three atypical AP’s and an SSRI antidepressant. This phenomenon is really no different than hearing voices. The difference being that it’s others thoughts you are aware of instead of audible voices."

176127468,"I know it’s difficult to stay calm _AT_MENTION_. I understand this is a scary time. Believe me, I do understand how you’re feeling since I have severe anxiety even under “normal” circumstances and with the current uncertainty of the COVID-19 situation, my anxiety can get really bad. Similar to you, I also have an elderly parent (my mom) to be concerned about. I am also a similar age to you. So I absolutely get how you’re feeling. What has helped me in recent days is understanding that anxiety comes from uncertainty and not having control over a situation. None of us have control over the COVID-19 situation itself, but we do have some control over how we react to it. Following the recommended guidelines from reputable national health organizations such as the CDC and your local health agencies regarding COVID-19 is a good idea (e.g., hand washing, etc.). What is also important is that you try to live as healthy as you can, independent of the COVID-19 situation. That includes eating healthy
, exercising if you’re able to, and especially trying to reduce your stress. Perhaps doing guided imagery to reduce anxiety might be helpful (YouTube has a lot of this kind of thing as do music streaming services). Maybe trying something relaxing like chair yoga or regular yoga might be helpful. Also, reach out to your mental health care team to see what they can recommend to help you better manage the anxiety and uncertainty."

I have issues copining with reality so i want to stay more in sleeping zone. And how can you mask that face effect that azolar-riset-latuda are making on your visiable look.? I look like i dont have typical human movements. Here is and my strong food desire. And the main reason is that even when i was on high doses of azolar and haldol i dont have schizophrenical symptoms. And when i was on low dose dont have. Or at any dose. And im asking myself why do i need to take that pills? The doctors and my family is strict that i must drink pills. They dont tell me why. I think that because i started to look my human rights.

But i also have to say, that the lack of energy was also from my conversion disorder, based on delusional basis maybe… Now i try to ignore all my symptoms and to move forward… But today again, i woke up as the slave of my weak body… I had no energy at all… Every day is still different here, i wonder when it’ll get more stable… One friend told me, that my body still has its forces, that the lack of energy is just a symptom, but i cant hide that my body was marked from the inactivity… My plan is to get less afraid and start to walk outside more. I hate still every kind of sport lol… My body shape is strange now, yeah… I wonder how the othe

Besides I stopped searching, buying and trying supplements. In the past when I was really sick Sarcosine was the one magic bullet that really had changed a lot for me out of the dozens of supplements and drugs I tried over the course of more than 10 years. My biggest challenge right now is to find a solution for my years of ongoing sleeping problems. And it sounds and it’s contradicted but the one thing that really helps my sleep, mood and negative symptoms is alcohol so I’m pretty much “self-medicating” with it. IDK, I have hopes that one of the chemically made negative/cognitive drugs currently in phase III will pass through and might change a lot for me. Since you are way smarter than me, maybe it’s a good idea for you to take a 23andMe DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis test. I’m confident that you’ll know how

This today has resulted in me not being a nice person to the pdoc, as he was not welcome to call me at 12:30pm, as I cancelled the appointment. I was very cross with him.

176127625,"Not a fan. I was called treatment resistant and “high acuity”, and Clozaril seemed like the answer. I was on it for 13 years. I gained 120lbs, even while doing TaeKwonDo 3x a week and almost starving myself. I became pre-diabetic. I hated my body and myself. It gave me night drooling and even sometimes incontinence, which made it impossible for me to have a relationship from the ages of 20 to 33. The doctors blamed my weight gain on eating, which I wasn’t doing much of, and not exercising, which I was doing a bunch of. I slept 18 hours a day. The blood tests left permanent tracks in my inner elbow, which I now have to explain to doctors. And my platelet count is permanently low after all that time on it, which causes easy bruising and prevents my blood from clotting normally. It definitely stabilised my positive symptoms, but I’m glad i was taken off of it. Once I needed a surgery that had to be postponed for a month, because Clozaril gave me tachycardia (I was 134 beats/ min at rest), and 
i had to spend that month on Haldol, just to get my heart rate down enough so they could safely operate on me. The surgery went fine. I went back on Clozaril. And by the way, if you ever stop taking it, it doesn’t work as well the second time, nor do any other antipsychotics. I got off of it by going on Invega. I dropped 50 lbs while doing NOTHING different. So, I’m not a fan of this med, no. But I’m only sharing this in case someone is weighing their options. It does do well for some people, but the benefits didn’t outweigh the side effects for me. If you can manage on something else, try that first. PS. Saphris is a derivative of Clozaril, and it did the same thing."

176127667,"I do, not often but sometimes. The MyFitnessPal App has a good database that you can search for any food, food from restaurants etc, and add them to your daily tracker. All for free.

176127669,I’m glad you’re being kind to yourself. Admitting a disability is really hard. My husband and I both went through a period where we couldn’t accept our disabilities

176127672,"I have a nervous habit of picking at my fingers, and I’m trying to break the habit. So I thought I would buy some fidget jewelry to occupy my hands. I know it exists, because several of my students used it. But I can’t find any anywhere that suits my purpose. Does anyone here use fidget jewelry? If so, where did you buy it? Does anyone have recommendations?"
176127673,I hope it works for you. I know how miserable insomnia gets when it’s every night.

176127676,_AT_MENTION_ this is also irrelevant. What _AT_MENTION_ is describing here is thought withdrawal regardless of this. Just like with thought insertion. It only matters that there is a delusion that thoughts are being inserted or removed by something external.

176127679,"Mine was a quiet day - and not a christmas _NAME_ in sight lol. In fact i had pink _NAME_ blasting, playing air guitar when i was waiting for the dinner to cook. Gave in and had a shandy (0.5%)! And my god it tasted good. No more tho. I bogged off to bed at 7pm - rang my twin and he did the same lol. Spent the day watching the whole series of the Witcher on netflix. Im quietly laughing at those waking up with hangovers haha."
176127680,"Yeah, that’s a great idea. Bookstores are usually quiet and peaceful. When I first got sick when I was 19 and extremely psychotic I found a bookstore near my group home and regularly used to walk there and browse the store for an hour or two. Nobody noticed me, no one bothered me. That was my thing."

176127685,"finally got a referral to a pdoc. It’s scheduled for February 10th. It will be 7 months since I’ve had psychiatric care. Usually I see a pdoc every month or sometimes 2 months if things are going smoothly. It’s been challenging especially since there’s been something I’ve wanted to address and I think a meds change my be in order. And it’s been a year since I’ve had any labs ordered, that makes me worried. But at least I have a date and a name now so I know it’s finally going to happen. So that’s good. I just wish there wasn’t such a shortage of providers in my area and I could get in sooner. Still no word as to when I can start therapy."

176127693,"Good for you! Sounds like a great road to recovery. You asked does anyone want to volunteer, I do, I’m emailing a facility tomorrow to work at a food bank"
176127694,"I’ve gone on one date in the past five years. Having my own home base would change things drastically. Definitely a confidence boost! Not far. I have a good relationship with them, I help them as much as they me. Parents could visit whenever, just no pop-ins!"

Yes - ill get a bit paranoid maybe, but who cares, ive locked myself indoors. I just need a rest from the ongoing battle with my head. _AT_MENTION_ I have just started therapy on “how to cope with distressing voices” , they even get you to download an app so they can track your moods, and give you a book to read. So maybe i will be less self relient on chemicals like alcohol or Thc to help me cope,"

176127746,"I beg to differ, and I appreciate both your honesty and contribution. But the truth is that the fact that I don’t fully believe my unusual beliefs, and retaining always some degree of insight, ironically makes the process of self-understanding and acceptance of my diagnosis harder rather than easier. Well, I already half-agree with myself, so I’d rather have people disagreeing with me. It’s not being right that I’m after but ascertaining the truth, whatever that might be.

You don’t pack your things when you run away from life. I’m so tired. E: Almost forgot to add. Since I know you all are so kind and concerned, I’m not at risk. I am seeing a therapist consistently.

That’s the stance and belief you need to take, then the whole God telling you can’t do things or telling you to do things will slowly ease up on you. Don’t be surprised if your “god” voice trys to take on a different entity once you stop believing that. That was my case anyway when I gave up that belief it became ‘aliens, _PERSON_, etc’ until one day they just said they were my brain. We have psychosis. The whole believing in gods can speak to you in a voice, is flat out no good for someone who is susceptible to psychosis. Takes courage and a want to change your mindset but you can do it. Cheers"
176127749,I had pain in my heart during exercise and dizziness. It scared me to death. I had a trip to the emergency room and a complete workup by an Cardiologist to find out I don’t have Angina. Thankfully. It was probably muscle pain and some anxiety he said. Definitely not my heart. But you gotta check it out he said to be sure.
176127750,the first one i ever saw yelled ‘do you think people are out to get you?!?’ and it went downhill from there. I tend to be evasive if someone is trying to provoke a certain reaction. I guess you are right though. I should be straight although some have asked me questions like ‘do you really believe so and so’ in disbelief as if they thought I was faking bad or something.

174374520,"Hi. I want to reassure you. I’ve had schizophrenia since I was 14 years old. I didn’t get on medication until I was 24. I didn’t get any kind of treatment until I was 18. And now, I’m married, I own a house, I used to work full time but I recently stopped because my husband and I are adopting a child together and I need to stay home to take care of him. The road to get here wasn’t easy. I didn’t know what schizophrenia was until I was 24. I was very against treatment. I made a lot of dumb decisions. You’re already so far ahead of me just by seeing a doctor and a therapist. You’re only 16. Honestly, I used to work with adolescents who had mental health challenges, and the medication doesn’t work particularly well for anyone going through puberty. Unless you’re in serious danger, most good psychiatrists try to limit youth exposure to psych meds. There are only a couple that are even approved for pediatric use, and they all have side effects."

176127762,"I think the low IQ thing actually comes from people doing bad on tests during low cognition times. I was pretty intelligent and a lot of people assume I finished college courses, before hitting low cognitive slumps. It really depends where you are in the cycle of normal function and low function. I’ve written a fiction novel that was picked up by a publisher, ghostwritten numerous health books, and freelanced articles for years. But then I hit a low point and began cycling through really low cognitive points so badly that I lost all my work and today would be hard pressed to write something that looked like my old work. During the slumps I am sure my IQ looks like I’m dumb as dirt. So being tested then would make me look as if I was a sz with low intelligence."
174374521,"so a couple weeks ago I noticed I was becoming dehydrated. in response to that I began to drink more water. physically I am feeling much better. I have been drinking a gallon of water a day. I’ve been filling up an old milk jug over at mom and dad’s because their water tastes better and is filtered. the only thing I don’t like, is all the frequent bathroom visits. I must’ve peed 10-15 times yesterday. also I noticed I had a return of racing thoughts and voices last night. at first I suspected the water, but then came to my senses and realized I am a schizophrenic who just hears voices and has racing thoughts every once in a while. anyways, I think I may be over doing it on the water, 60-120oz would probably be enough. what do you think?"
176127763,"It is tough when what you think others think of you manifest in delusions. If you always think the worst of yourself and expect to hear and see that from others then that is exactly what you manifest, even when it is completely wrong! For example, an angry dog enters a mirrored room and sees an angry dog looking back at himself. He leaves the room infuriated. A happy dog enters the room and sees happiness all around him and leaves the room happy, tail wagging. It is the same for szs mirroring what they believe they feel other people think. Take note, you deserve to be happy and a happy outlook and self love will reflect in joyous experience for a sz if you see the world that way. And the opposite if you feel bad about yourself, as exemplified by your original post."
174374538,"Only one way to manage negative symptoms and that is to develop good habits and follow them strictly. The reason for negative symptom is lack of emotions or blunted affect. Habits help us to do things without the help of emotions, interest etc."
176127764,"The last time I checked I owed $11,700. I can only make minimum payments on the credit cards. But in 18 months I will pay off a personal loan, so the $230 payment on that can be applied to my credit card debt. I’ve had a bad time financially. A crown for my tooth $1,100, latest car repair bill was $1,000, oral surgery $800, a new bed $500. I may have to file bankruptcy if my rent or auto insurance go up."
176127765,"I had a few thoughts about sz. I was thinking about sz as being a form of pure subjectivity, or individuality. While most ‘normal’ people are intersubjective, meaning they exist purely in a world of shared symbols and meanings, those with sz often cannot even communicate their experiences to others or have their own meanings and symbols for things. They are alone, and others automatically avoid them almost instinctually. To be an intersubjective person means to a large extent to participate and be a consumer of pop culture which most people who have sz have probably done at some point. But when they are most afflicted they withdraw into themselves and become preoccupied with thoughts, delusions, feelings and hallucinations others cant intersubjectively share. Think what it is like to have a purely individual subjectivity, such a mind would not be understandable to others and would be treated like sz. Another thought I was having was about individual freedom and sz. When someone is ‘normal’ 
they do routine things, say common things, and behave in predictable ways. If there is free-will it is hard to argue that a normal person has it. Almost every thought, action and object that defines normality constrains a person to predetermined ends. However a sz person is often living without routines, with a delusion, or feeling of being controlled so their actions are often aimed at escaping from whatever it is they perceive. So nobody knows quite what a sz is going to do or when they are going to do it. Of course the scope of possible things that anyone can do is finite, so there is of course common ‘sz’ things. But again, the nature of sz is that it is unpredictable. I have a few more thoughts about sz, but that’s all I have time for, for now."

176127778,"Hey! My memories are always associated with a place too. I become so fond of places. Sometimes I have trouble remembering important details of a situation but I can remember where it happened. When you’re trying to remind someone of a specific conversation, do you ever start describing the place in which a conversation took place instead of the actual words in the conversation? I don’t know if it’s rare but it’s for sure interesting as heck."

176127779,"Not eating can cause you to be irritable and possibly lead to aggression. Your blood sugar drops which leads to a host of wonky stuff going on. I’ve not been eating lately due to symptoms from my autoimmune illnesses. It causes me to be irritable at times when my sugar drops. Not every time, because sometimes it’s anxiety and other times I feel sad. The only upside is weight loss."
176127780,yeah my heart rate runs chronically fast because of one of my meds thats a stimulant. It also causes me to get palpitations sometimes too. I actually had a cardiac study done on me a year or two ago because i had a scare with it interacting with another med but they didn’t find any issues then. I will definitely bring this up w a doctor.

176127784,"So? Again, if we can take away the rights of someone who is suicidal then why cant we take away the rights of someone showing warning signs of violence?"
176127785,"Apart from lower back pain , which is probably due to me being obese, there’s no physical reason I can’t exercise. I can’t get on with exercise routines though. Most likely because I’m not that well coordinated due to possible/probable dyspraxia . I had aimed to walk a bit to reduce the swelling of my ankles and legs , but after an initial burst of enthusiasm have failed miserably. I’m not always very good at sticking at things. As it is I csn’t walk very far anyway because of my poor sense of direction."
176127786,"I always used to carry a balance of about $500 of credit card debt every month that I would pay off in full each month. And I never had a written, planned budget either. And I also never used to balance my checkbooks. (Because I rarely to never wrote checks.). But, ever since I read the book “Financial Peace Revisited”, by _NAME_, and did the workbook, “Financial Peace Planner”, also by _NAME_, I have turned over a new leaf. For example, I don’t use a credit card anymore, I use my debit card instead. I now have a detailed, written budget that I use and update regularly. I now balance my checkbook on a regular basis. And I’m now saving much more than I was before. And I have long term goals. I had few financial problems other than some bookkeeping issues. But, where _PERSON_ comes in handy is when a person is deeply in debt but doesn’t want to declare bankruptcy. He can really help you to dig your way out and come out on top, if you follow his program, which is rather simple. I highly 
recommend _NAME_s books to anyone looking to get their financial house in order."

I have an appointment on 1st October for the Clozapine clinic, so i’ll definitely mention it then. As for work, i’ve never been someone who spends a lot of time on my apperance…but it is getting to the point where i spend next to no time on it.

My older friend used the term ‘Eskimo’ once, and his young daughter was in disbelief and scolded him for using that word. I just think younger people have their antennas up, so to speak when it comes to language and it’s usage…more so than when I was younger. We never over-thought stuff as much growing up…like the calling for banning the movie Grease which was a topic a few days ago. I don’t ever recall growing up in my youth, anyone calling for the boycott of any movie or book. We all just went with the flow."
174374549,Yes thank you very much. It does help it prevents me from feeling as if it’s something I should be completely afraid of.

Had to wake up super early which goes against the natural teen body clock and promotes sleep deprivation and poor academic performance. (I believe this severe sleep deprivation played a big factor in me having my first major episode) Highschool was by and large a complete waste of time as well as damaging to my mental health. Highschool took a huge toll on my little brother’s mental health to where he was hospitalized twice and one of my good friends had the same experience. Homeschooling helped them tremendously. My brother doesn’t even need meds or therapy anymore."
176127859,Just look at the DSM when in doubt. There needs to be symptoms of sz for 6 months. This doesnt have to be _NAME_ psychotic symptoms. Then _NAME_ psychotic symptoms for a month. Only one episode of psychosis is needed for a diagnosis. Some people only get one episode in their life. Also reading these comments i want to remind everyone that no ones sz is the same. Some people are absolutely disabled severely by it while others can take medicine and live a relatively normal life. I absolutely try my best to stay on meds because im going to school for my dream career and working while not in school. But recently my meds stopped working as well and i went off my meds for a few days thinking it was poisoned. I was completely disabled for a week but forced myself to take the meds and regained functioning. I recognized how fragile my mental health is and how incredibly lucky i am to have my insight because not everyone has this. No need to judge one another.

174374562,"It’s harder for a schizophrenic to quit. There’s a lot of stress, and other vices such as alcohol and other legal drugs are off-limits due to how they induce psychosis in schizophrenics… that’s probably why a large amount of schizophrenics smoke.

176127882,"Here’s my belief on why you shouldn’t completly rely on medicine to help you. It starts with how our brains are programmed. If we spend our lives in a supportive atmosphere and living with people who wish us good, then we should live a healthy sustainable life. However, if we spend our lives being mentally or physically abused, then we will suffer for the rest of our lives. It’s all about having the right support and a healthy atmosphere. Medication comes into play to GUIDE us into the right path. It wont necessarily fix our internal problems, but it will lead us to a place where we can thrive and survive. Sure it can fix the chemical imbalances in our heads, but in the end it paves a way for us to live a “normal” life."

Even if this doesn’t work out at least I’ll be able to say I tried haha. Nothing wrong with being on meds for life. And thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! I’m going to schedule my therapy appointments closer together while I attempt this taper, I think, so my mood will be monitored more closely and consistently and warning signs could potentially be caught sooner, ones that I might miss"
176127900,"But wouldn’t that partial release from the grip of delusion at least contribute to rendering the delusion behaviourally inert? (of course many delusions are inert to start with). Also, what about the reverse, could being good at masking your symptoms, double-booking, remaining more or less functional weaken the incentive to get better upon gaining some initial insight?"
176127901,"I am glad your voices aren’t mean, I have some voices that are not mean. I feel embarrassed when they stand up for me. The rest of the voices are very mean. I just want to be left alone. I don’t get what they have against me. They tell me they are going to kill me. I wish I can turn them in. What they are doing is not right. These voices are ruining my life making me feel terrible. I am trying to see a new doctor in the place I am moving to. I want kinder voices too."

176127910,"Is there any personality disorder that can cause psychosis. I thought I had Psychosis NOS but my doctor is saying that something is wrong with my personality and this causes me to have psychosis. He is very vague and careful when he talks about my diagnosis. Something triggers me and then I get psychotic. I read about schizoid personality disorder, but I’m sure I don’t have this illness. What do you guys think?"
176127911,"I feel restless, I pace back and forth in the house, racing thoughts and too much energy. Its like hypomania for me."

176127919,Is there a way 5 mg ambien would work and 10 wouldn’t? The first time I took 5 with success then went to 10 and it hasn’t worked maybe don’t even take it anymore or cut the pill in half? _PERSON_ thank you forum
176127920,So by right you can’t sell lurasidone generic?even though it’s approved?
176127921,My symptoms are controlled at the moment. But every fall when the time changes I get severely depressed. I don’t know how to fix that…
176127922,correction. my cooking is dangerous for others. I dont know what the heck im doing and my tastebuds aint so accurate.
176127923,"I dirty myself while on antipsychotics, never did before taking antipsychotics."
176127924,good job on the 30 minute jog! I think it’s cool you did that. I find it hard going out without help… by myself i get paranoid.
176127925,I started walking and the only thing that stopped me was the nausea and vomitting. Make sure you bring water with you.
176127926,"Today I’m going to see my nutritionist and to get weighed. My scale says I’ve lost 2 more pounds. Then I have to go the department store to return something for my sister. I guess I should go to the grocery for fresh veggies if I want to eat anything. And of course I need to find time to walk on the treadmill, even though I might skip it if my hip keeps hurting so bad. Other than that not much going on. What are you doing today? Anything good?"
176127927,"You know what? I don’t know what to say…but you are a good guy. My relationship with God is pretty complex too. I make a lot of mistakes and He forgives and blesses me. That’s what I thought you could have with Him. He is the all in all. sufficient, the best. Who do you see to get famous artist. You’ re good I hope you can sell some pictures in Germany or Amsterdam or some where. How long is the flight?"
176127928,They’re after me because they think I’m an agent for a foreign country
176127929,"Well, you know, I was so closed since kid, that all my family didnt hear a word from me since I was small… i almost didn’t talk, i was closed, i was passive, i lacked energy, i wasnt sharing nothing and i was probably cold… I was like this all my life since kid, pals… I dont know why I was such a kid. My diagnosis of sz came when I was 26. But my sister knowing me like this all my life, once said in her anger that i am a zombie… she knew nothing else from me… Is there a sz like this? A sz since kid?? Is it my case? At the time it hurt me a lot, that she called me a zombie… that she knew nothing else from me, yeap… I wont go back in this zombie state, no? It’s a scar now I guess the fact, that I was almost not a human in the past, for never… I hope I’ll get over this wound… I just hear stories of schizophrenics who were “someone” before their diagnosis… idk why me, I was almost dead like since kid… Hugs"
176127930,"Well an update on my parents, my mom is still pissed at me and started making passive agressive comments about how successful I was when I was working on the ambulance and began to elude that I should get back into having discipline. She then began to give me flack about my decision to leave medical school. (well I I moved to another country for school for a few years almost finished but couldnt because the school lost the loan program for the american students when the banks reconsolidated; and with loans now due I had to consider other alternatives like physician assistant school, but since my college credits’expired’ in the eyes of the admissions departments because its been more than 7 years since I got my degree, I had to go back to college and retake my basic sciences.) So I’ve been doing that the past year and a half. Moved to seattle because it was a quarter system, and right after I established myself my parents said to move home because my dad is well advanced in his years and they 
wanted me to help out more. So I moved back to hawaii, living at my parents mother in law studio, now 34, with more debt than income. My parents then suggest to me to invest my loan payments in the stock market, I did made about 20k in 4 months, then for the past few months have been building it up in my mind to return to medical school and finish. Because now I have almost enough money. They really convinced me to finish what I started rather than take the pa route. So I got accepted into a different school in the carribbean and am scheduled to start from home in a week because of quarentine. The messed up part is, I went to discuss w my dad the pending documents to cosign on my loan and my mom overheard our conversation and jumped in yelling saying their not going to cosign on my loan no matter what. So I asked about how I could finish and they she said this is a pipe dream I need to grow up and forget about it! Now I spent months preparing myself for it and now she turned the tides on me. And the worse par
t is the money I made from selling my car in the picture went to paying for her new deck for the house for my dad. Then she has the audacity to complain about money needed to finish the landscaping and other handman work. Since they like to control me with money, I thought she would want me to solve the problem. So I proposed, instead of #k to this guy and $2k to the other handyman, why not let me do the work and take that money and invest it in our family and my education. She entertained the idea, and thats where I am today. With this money I can pay for one semester I only have two more to go so I might not need the loan for the next semester. I just dont know what Ill do after that. I hope I can make more money in the stock market, but last two weeks Ive been losing on my shorts. Im just so stressed about everything and havent been sleeping well. Mayby their right, I dont deserve to become a doctor and I am all that they say I am. Which is fine because mayby I am, but I just feel like there is so much for 
to strive for in life. ???? this disease and societies beliefs about where we are meant to fit in. It shouldnt be that way"
176127931,well if they say I can’t go I’ll kick off and that normally makes them let me do the things I want to do. They said I can’t have a MacBook Air so I kicked off and they then let me purchase one.
176127932,Chop wood for winter
176127933,"The best way to exercise the brain is through physical exercise. Especially running, burpees and squats. Next best way is by learning new things like languages or musical instruments."
176127934,"is there such a thing as talking to much, sharing too much, and being seen as a huge burden they’d rather not hear from?"
176127935,You have a favorable story Do you tell people up have problems with mental health? Or is it just a non issue?
176127936,"Also dishes, and more dishes, and more dishes. Laundry. Relax on my day off."

176127938,"Welcome back naturally cured. Good to see you. Having stability does feel great I reckon. Stability financially to afford bills , food , living etc and stability of sanity and peace ."
176127939,"I remember you from about a year and a half ago going through this 'spectacle"" as you call it. The talking thing is a part I really believe… example on my blog I mentioned a speech I did in college about how NYC should have police cars and taxi cabs both be yellow. To deter street crime was the point I was making. Not long after and coincidentally while in psychosis _PERSON_ of all things made a t.v. spot that included a yellow car, and it felt like an aggressive vibe, and it caused fear in me. But if I hadn’t expressed my thoughts in the first place, there wouldn’t have been that negative emotion. Can you think of an example of this in your life?"
174374578,"when i first consulted my pdoc many years back i asked him what is my diagnosis he said i have personality disorder. after a couple of weeks on my 2nd appointment with him i asked him what is a personality disorder, what kind of disease is that? he said i have schizophrenia."
176127940,They are wonderful. Maybe you’ll have a family of your own someday and then you can have grandbabies someday too.
176127941,"_AT_MENTION_ ,that’s a lot of questions you’re asking… What bothers you most?"
174374571,Or maybe I faked the whole thing that crossed my mind too. Maybe I don’t have mood swings.
176127942,When someone’s post seem delusional we tell them to help them know that to tell their psychiatrist who will increase dosage or change to a stronger ap.
176127943,I am too greedy lol
176127944,I was very anxious so i went to see one. Worst mistake of my life !! When i was in their doctors rooms i got paranoid that they were going to lock me up and the goddamn psychiatrist noticed me being paranoid and decided to medicate me to the high heavens !! These ???????? anti psychotics have made me paranoid and now ive screwed myself !!
176127945,"ok you not schizophrenia , then i would have to say you a bad person, and a sick in nature. maybe you well come down off the drugs and start thing strate or not. anyway have a better day dude, schizophrenia an’t all that bad."
176127946,"Assuming what you say is correct, how would they feel? You’re not the only person in the world who’s choked their chicken. I’m sure everyone in paradise has wanked it a few times. Don’t let paranoia get the best of you."

176127949,"It took me like two to three years of treatment to get insight back. I don’t really experience depression most days, just hallucinations and sometimes I get sad about my disease but I don’t dwell on it. If I didn’t have hallucinations my days would be a lot more peaceful. I get no privacy and some days I am constantly narrated or interrogated by the voices."

176127953,My new hard drive came in today. They are imaging it right now. Might ship out today.
176127954,"my pdoc said it’s ok to feel better and have more energy or plans. she said im probably adjusting to the meds. she also said to look out for mania if im not sleeping, or if people close to me start complaining or mentioning my behavior."
176127955,I signed up to be an NHS volunteer responder. My application is currently under review.
176127956,A quick reboot from a nap often helps me see things more clearly but I could not sleep when I was psychotic.
176127957,"The doctor said to me today that even though my prolactin is high, the benefit of the medication outweighs the risk. So as long as I don’t have physical symptoms from high prolactin, then I should continue taking Amisulpride. I am not sure how I feel about someone else making a decision about the benefit vs. risk. That said I don’t want the hassle of switching Antipsychotic again as this controls my symptoms well. Is this a doctor decision or mine?"
176127958,Great i feel alot better now omg. I never going to do this again. i learn my lesson the hard way. when i get the ejuice i going return asap.
176127959,I filled out a job application but haven’t received any phone call back.
176127960,"After the first two years of psychosis I started to improve a little and then I became stable. I got a job and eventually a car and eventually enrolled myself in college and made a couple friends. Unfortunately, I relapsed, probably due to drug use. But I started over when I quit drugs and got another job, enrolled in a different college and I became stable again. This was in my thirties. Around 40 years old I started making real improvements and my symptoms went down. My life continued on and just about a year or two ago at age 57 I finally got the peace of mind I craved for so many years. And I have great moments ofv peace and my mind slows down and things get quiet now."
176127961,I don’t know man all I know is that it sucks.
176127962,"Thank you for sharing. It sounds like you were very dedicated, I really admire that. I’ll consider that when I try to get hired!"

176127964,"I struggle with thought broadcasting, too. I didn’t read your entire original post (sorry, I’m terrible at reading long blocks of text. Nothing personal), but I’ve had similar experiences as you. Then when I got put on meds, it sort of went away. Not entirely, but it’s much more manageable now."
176127965,I’m 28 years old
174374589,"I wish I could help you other than saying to try Clozapine. I read that Vraylar is one of the weakest antipsychotics, weaker than Latuda and Abilify, now I am scared of trying it. Try to not analyze and to not believe your delusions, I know its almost impossible without working meds."
176127966,"I wish Amisulpride came in injection. If you have ever had problems with remembering tablets or being non-compliant, it’s a good idea to go for the shot. I never realised they had a three month one. Sounds better than having to go to the pharmacy every month and trying to take tabs everyday."
174374576,I think that’s not a good idea. How about changing your meds instead? Try something like Abilify or Vraylar which are stimulating and won’t make you tired. But you may still have akathisia. I’m on Invega switching slowly to Vraylar and I can’t really recommend Invega due to all the side effects I’m experiencing but it doesn’t make you as sedated either and the akathisia isn’t too bad.
176127967,wow! This is amazing! Keep the good work up !
176127968,I rode horses at summer camp in Colorado as a teen. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
176127969,"I get paranoia when going outside now. I can challenge it, and like use earbuds with music on. But with the convenience of ordering shopping and paying bills online - i usually stay indoors. Im sorta “used” to it now. It does get better over time."

174374574,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Deficits in Sexual Interest Among Adults With Schizophrenia: Another Look at an Old Problem. CL Bianco, SI Pratt and JC Ferron, Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.) , Aug 2019 12 Despite the important impact of sexuality on quality of life in adults, there is a paucity of research on this topic for people with schizophrenia. This study examined predictors of sexual interest among adults with schizophrenia.Using data from three studies with similar measures and participants with similar characteristics (N=231), the authors conducted a secondary analysis to examine the relationships among sexual interest, demographic characteristics (gender, age, living situation, and marital status), and clinical factors (sexual self-efficacy, symptom severity, and medications). Sexual interest was measured by using one item from the Scale to Assess Negative Symptoms. Binomial logistic regressions were conducted to explore factors most associated with level of sexual interest.Separately, cardiova
scular medications, gender, age, sexual self-efficacy, and negative symptoms were associated with sexual interest. In a logistic regression model that included all of these factors, only sexual self-efficacy and gender were significantly associated with sexual interest. Higher levels of sexual self-efficacy were associated with lower levels of impairment in sexual interest (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.98-0.99, p<0.001), and males were less likely than females to have impaired sexual interest (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.20-0.73, p=0.004).The strength of the relationship between sexual self-efficacy and sexual interest warrants development of interventions to address sexuality among people with serious mental illness, at least for those who are interested in developing or maintaining intimate relationships. An intervention that teaches skills needed to successfully pursue and navigate intimate relationships could positively influence overall quality of life for many."

176127990,"Oh no how long have you had this much anxiety for,?"
176127991,It always comes down to willpower. There’s no miracle treatment. Because addiction is engrained into your brain and it’s tough to break the cycle even with chemical intervention. Even with naltrexone +Zoloft decreasing my cravings for alcohol and other drugs tenfold. There’s a lot of things I have to manage correctly to stay sober. And it does involve willpower. However is much much easier with meds for me assisting me. Which pill did she give you?? Not Wellbutrin no??? Wellbutrin can help stop smoking. I’m allergic to the patch so I always used the gum and I liked it cuz it satisfy the oral fixation a bit.

176128001,"Never really thought about it that way before. But thinking back many years ago when I was at my most psychotic, I did learn very well to control my symptoms. My life was hell and I had nothing but I just naturally walked around and worked and went out to eat or to a play etc. and I acted, sounded and looked so normal that very few people could tell I was I’ll. I could go to a movie and be bats*it crazy and sit there gong crazy in my mind and I guess to all outwards appearances I appeared perfectly normal. I had paranoia, delusions, racing mind, weird perceptions etc. No one could tell. About the only person I told about my delusions was my dad.

176128009,"So I have mentioned how when I am bored I often fall into the trap of going back to my triggers. SZ can be exciting, and it is what I am paid for after all, such is the benefits trap. I have a really good opportunity to do something with my maths paper that will benefit me and contribute to the growth of maths. Whether that is a good thing or not is a matter of perspective. I also have the opportunity to study TCM informally and hopefully more formally when my shiatsu classes start again. Finally, I have the opportunity to work on myself, which we all do, in reality, through our life lessons. What more do I want? Am I being wanton? I have been attracted to the drama of the world and the adventure of engaging with it, even though this has harmed me. The drama of the world seems more important to me than self care. Engaging with it gives me a grand purpose that flatters my pride. My purpose should be self-care, am I complaining by saying that, or is it that I fear failure of self? I am content with w
hat I have, yet feel ashamed for being diagnosed SZ and thus being a failure in regards to my father’s expectations. I am scared of my dependency on others, yet do nothing to change this, other than to toy with publishing something. I am scared of being judged, yet constantly strive to place myself at the centre of judgment. Anyway, life goes on, Thank you."

I was losing myself and felt like I was dying right then. The only thing I had to cling to was the concept of god, which I did, and continued to do for quite some time. I didn’t believe in god before that moment but when you feel lost and like it’s the end you have to reach out of the dark toward something I suppose."

When I finally did have sex for the first time at the age of 33 and then again a few months later, I realised that it wasn’t such a big deal and I could do without, that’s pretty much the position I am in now, but I still believe in polyamory and would be happy to have sex if there is love."

174374619,"Well that leads to an obvious conclusion. I tend to not agree with your views but everybody has a right to believe what they want. I don’t know what you consider “smart” or “dumb” but there have been some really brilliant men and women throughout history and that’s a fact. Hell, we’re still studying Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle’s views 2000 years after they died. THAT says something for their intellect."

176128087,Your never going to please everyone and everyone here has an opinion. Just best to avoid drama with others. If you see something that is inappropriate then flag it. Everyone else has the same options. It’s not easy keeping the peace but it works for our community if sometimes you avoid drama with others.
176128088,Yes hyper religiosity is definitely a symptom of SZ/SZA and bipolar manic episodes. It hit me hard for years.
174374610,Because I was too smart in school even after sz. But negative symptoms are preventing me from using that in real life and not on paper.

174374631,"I’m schizoaffective, and my doctors believe that I’ve been this way for the past 8 years. I only started medication five or so months ago, and I don’t know how I lived without it. I have had some breakthrough symptoms, but honestly… I can think clearly again, I don’t have voices shouting in my ear, I no longer have a running commentary on my actions, I no longer feel like I’m being watched, become “turned out” or disassociated with the world, etc. So with that said, I strongly recommend getting on medication. It’s a trial and error process. The first ones usually don’t work. I know that from experience. But once you do find something that works, you’ll wonder why you went med-less in the first place (imo). Now don’t worry, medications won’t change who you are. They won’t make you a “normie” or anything like that. I was worried about that too. But if you’re experiencing symptoms of SZ, then you need to be treated. And the longer you go without treatment, the harder 
it will be for you to “come back”. And yes, that means (potentially) hardcore APs. So please, please, please at least try medication."
176128103,That’s a lot of words. I never had a review but I just said delusions distort my perception of reality and impair my judgement and decision making ability on my application. I did list out 7 failed jobs in the 6 previous years. I think that really sealed the deal though. That’s literally all I wrote and I got approved in less than three months with no exam and my reviews were scheduled for every seven years. But I got stable on meds and went back to school and back to work soon after.
174374630,"_AT_MENTION_ yeah I do talk to her about ‘negative symptoms’ type stuff like that. Even though I don’t have sz It’s really good to talk to her about that. The negs are bad. I’m more worried about talking to her about the other bad stuff happening. I was doing really good. I am very frightened. I am a smart woman and have very good coping skills from my past. I also feel I am letting people down because I was doing so good. Very frightened tonight My husband is very good man but it’s hard for him if I am not well. He is kind to me but if I’m really sick he finds it very hard so I am not burdening him, but he said he doesn’t want me to be in the hospital. Yes i will take your lovely advice, keep showing him love. I think I do that well. You are good to talk to. You have a good vibe. Thanks"

176128114,"I had a pretty rough day yesterday, just too many cognitive symptoms, I guess that is what you can call them, all I know is my brain was fighting me most of the day. I have had COVID-19 on my mind too much but to put it bluntly my head was just messed up. Processing stuff and memory was in a bad way and all too often I kept having thoughts pop in that it would be easier if I would just be dead. I mean the thoughts were more graphic and intense than that but I know they weren’t the most rational thoughts, I try to say that and mean it all the way but how certain can I really be in these cases when I can’t depend on my own mind working right. Another day that so far is better than the previous, my anxiety isn’t up yet and I don’t have hopelessness and existential dread, I talked with my psychiatrist and will have to do cognitive behavioral therapy with my therapist. I just get in worry loops and know they aren’t healthy but I get sucked in. I am pretty sure my kids are the only thing keepin
g me here again, I know everyone says to tell your doctor everything but I know where to draw the line if I don’t want to end up in the hospital, which would shred me with anxiety now. I still feel like I am stuck in some messed up alternate universe where I am being forced to suffer at times. It isn’t strong like my delusions used to be but I still feel like there is so much hopelessness. I hate that there are so many dark thoughts inside of me, I never thought I would end up being this way, I could never understand how some people could just let it all go but I understand it now and I wish I didn’t. I have a lot of life left which makes me have mixed feelings. Well I think I have said enough for now, someone else can hijack this thread I just had to get some of this out."

Now I eat healthier and less still 80lb more than before. With diet I lost 23lb in 2 months but now its slow to lose more. Idk how to lose weight faster, fat burners?

176128139,"Hi, _PERSON_ The idea is to limit the internal responses you give, as that will feed your ‘voices’ or ‘operators’. With me, it works by what I say or respond to, by using what’s termed as subvocalization or self-talk for short. If you feed it a load of tosh, like ‘Sorry, I don’t have 5 dollars’ or ‘Is sand passive’ they can’t make an accurate prediction upon your part, so it’s hard to form a trigger or anchor as I’ve already known this trick, trauma bonding is the next trick this so-called Brain disorder likes to try to move on me. Anyway, you need to try to limit what you say to yourself or what you respond to, try making up words or use an internal humming or make up a track or something. Good luck!"

This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant.

She was very racist and I was humiliated so many times when she would say N this and N that. And it was in front of her black nurses. I told them I was a minister and she was a member of the congregation and I visited her in that capacity, but that I in no way agreed with her. After a year, I couldn’t take it anymore and told the pastor I couldn’t visit her anymore. It showed me I still had work to do in forgiveness and loving all people.

176128212,"I literally just went through all the same things as you. Constipation for months, then hemmorids/bleeding, never happened before, I know it’s caused by my meds. I’m on Seroquel 700mg and Klonopin 1mg. I went to my primary care doctor (regular Dr.) and she said my AP is probably causing it. She prescribed me cream and suppository as well for the hemmoroids and then Miralax laxative to help my bowel movements. Everything was good while I was taking the Miralax and stuff for the hermmoids, all taken care of, until the Miralax ran out and I started getting bad constipation again. I went back to my Dr. and this time she decided to place me on a long term stool softener, very common, Docusate Sodium. It just helps draw water in your bowels. Many people can safely take it long term as it’s not a laxative per say. Obviously I’m not super thrilled, and neither was my Dr., but like you I can’t do anything about my medications. It’s been several weeks now and it has 100% fixed my constipation. I 
take the little red gel tablet with my meds every day and I no longer strain or have constipation or any bleeding or hemorrhoids. I suggest you talk to your doctor about a long term solution such as Docusate Sodium to bring the water into your bowels/colon and soften your stools. It’s a dehydration thing I believe, from the antipsychotic medication. I drink tons of water, excersize and everything as well and nothing else fixed it. Good luck."

174374677,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Do sleep disturbances contribute to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders? _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, TJ Vedal, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Aas and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience , Oct 2019 05 Sleep disturbances and cognitive impairments are both frequent across psychotic disorders, with debilitating effects on functioning and quality of life. This study aims to investigate if sleep disturbances are related to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia spectrum (SCZ) and bipolar disorders (BD), if this relationship varies between different sleep disturbances (insomnia, hypersomnia or delayed sleep phase (DSP)) and lastly, if this relationship differs between clinical groups and healthy controls (HC). We included 797 patients (SCZ?=?457, BD?=?340) from the Norwegian Centre for Mental Disorders Research (NORMENT) study in Norway. Sleep disturbances were based on items from the Inventory of Depres
sive Symptoms-Clinician rated scale (IDS-C). Their relationship with several cognitive domains was tested using separate ANCOVAs. A three-way between-groups ANOVA was conducted to test if the relationship with cognitive impairments varies between different sleep disturbances. These analyses revealed significantly poorer processing speed and inhibition in those with any sleep disturbance versus those without, also after adjusting for several covariates. The relationship between sleep disturbances and cognition was similar across SCZ and BD, and there were significant effects of insomnia and hypersomnia on both processing speed and inhibition. No association between sleep disturbances and cognition was found in HC. Sleep disturbances contribute to cognitive impairments in psychotic disorders. Processing speed and inhibition is poorer in patients with sleep disturbances. Impairments in these domains are related to insomnia and hypersomnia. These findings suggest that treating sleep disturbances is important to p
rotect cognitive functioning, alongside cognitive remediation in psychotic disorders."

They observe my surroundings and declare certain women “sexually functional.” I can’t be “sexually functional” because of what they have done to me. It’s the voices of exes who treated me badly and acted better than me. Also the voice of a woman from high school who said she hated me.

(I’m kinda bummed about the last one. Wait…) The following list shows how people reported feeling after a month of different activities, compared to people who were not physically active. (The result indicates the percentage of fewer poor mental health days; for example, those participating in team sports reported 22.3 percent fewer bad days than those who did not exercise.) Team sports: 22.3 percent Cycling: 21.6 percent Aerobic or gym exercise: 20.1 percent (does not include indoor bikes or treadmills) Running or jogging: 19 percent Recreational sports: 18.9 percent Winter or water sports: 18 percent Walking: 17.

At the very least keep taking them - until you spoken to your doctor. Please? You will regret it. I promise you.

I would meet a minister and tell him ask if importing of newer antipsychotics could be made faster especially for karxt and sep 363856 or other newer antipsychotics due to their more favourable side effect profile. From a book written by my prime minister, he wrote that citizens are most concerned about housing, education and medicine. I would think minister’s job is to help us attain those goals"

I am noticing a physical effect from it, though. If has a definite effect on my connective tissue. I think I might have gained some muscle mass too. I have a feeling that the L - theanine will get rid of most of my anxiety, but it will take a while. I’ve laid in about a year’s supply of L - Theanine, so I will have a good while to investigate this supplement. Also, it has a strange effect on my sleeping. I sleep about two or three hours, then wake up and mess around a little with the tv and my computer, then I go back to sleep again. I’ve been getting about nine hours of sleep a night like this."
174374727,It is true that Schizophrenia is viewed as a very dangerous and unmanageable condition by so many people. They don’t realize that we are not offensive and dangerous as a rule. In fact schizophrenics are at the receiving end of violence rather than perpetrating it. An average man does not have enough knowledge about Schizophrenia. They are not doctors after all. We must pardon them and try to mingle with people who are friendly with us. Social isolation is the worst thing which can happen with Schizophrenics who can get better with social exposure.

So instead of going out and getting and eating a box of donuts eat a few apples. Or drink a ton of water. Core power protein shakes can be filling and they are fairly low calorie and low sugar. Milk is filling.
176128453,I am a reality fanatic. I have delusions though that I check out with others that I trust- their reality. Sometimes I slip and have off perceptions. I try to concentrate on what is real to me. I believe in an ultimate reality. None of this illusions and delusions tangent. I have delusions like thought broadcasting that have been there a long time. But I don’t believe it and try to control my mind from going there. Its work. If I don’t dwell on myself I don’t find out how miserable I am. I want to be humanly joyful and seek human happiness in simple ways that make me see something greater than me and who I am.

If I have makeup on I wash it of with a facial wipe from Aldi as they are cheapest and environment friendly. If I’m not wearing makeup I often don’t wash my face at all or just with a mild soap. I would like to care for my skin a bit better. Some days I put coconut oil under my eyes.

They’re the ones who spend years studying these nuances in terminology. Your symptoms are your symptoms and your reality is your reality. Whatever label they slap on that doesn’t fundamentally change those things. You can always go get another professional opinion if the one you got a decade ago is really bothering you."

If I refused, then a police officer would show up looking for me and take me to the hospital where I would then be placed under supervision. Based upon what they saw, they would give me a booster shot or keep me for further treatment. My community mental health worker also wanted to place me in a full-time care facility, and yes they do monitor in those places. Not so much on a community treatment order, they are specifically given to people who have an ongoing history with med refusal. I’m glad I don’t have to deal with that stuff anymore."

It Was Like A Heavy Weight On My Shoulders Was Lifted. Not Only Did She Not Try To Ridicule Me, Hiding Behind Some Glass Of Education.

174374745,"Brain & Behavior Research Foundation – 13 Jun 19 Evidence Links Abnormally Formed Proteins With Schizophrenia Pathology in... Abnormally formed proteins may be involved in the pathology that causes schizophrenia in a subset of patients, new research suggests. The results of this research were striking. Twenty of the 42 schizophrenia brains that were analyzed contained significantly more insoluble proteins compared with the other 22 schizophrenia brains and the 41 control brains. The researchers then used a method called mass spectrometry to learn more about the proteins in the insoluble portion. In the brains with more insoluble proteins, they found unique and, also, abnormal proteins in greater abundance. The fact that the abnormal proteins were present in only half of the brain samples from schizophrenia patients suggests that the observed protein abnormalities are likely to be found only in a subset of schizophrenia patients, the team said. This work thus provides evidence that subtypes of the 
illness exist, which has implications for diagnosis and treatment development."

After the instability of the war was over, they didn’t think they needed him, and he died.

Let reseachers wrangle it out between themselves for 10 more years, maybe they will come up to some more solid conclusion."
176128537,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_.

176128544,My Mom never let up her hatred of me 'til the day she died. Part of it was her low self esteem. She could not like anything of hers. Something being her own meant nothing special to her.

176128551,"It would be interesting, but doctors deal with many other factors than just DSM-V protocols. There are things they don’t know and they don’t dare acting as if they knew everything. My first doctor (who hospitalized me), for example, never dared to say that I would have to take medicines for the rest of my life. That’s a very mature way of dealing with a patient instead of imposing his psychiatric view and reaping out all your hope."

176128565,"SZ is as biologically-based as normalcy is, no more no less. We allow ourselves to forget such an obvious fact because of the way we interiorise normative discourses. An important consequence follows: It’s logically unsound to infer exculsively from the biological basis of SZ any normative consequence at all. To do so means to incur in the commission of a naturalistic fallacy. (Disclaimer: of course, I’m not denying that biology explains sz in part). It follows, I’d argue, that sz is, in part, socially constructed precisely around the fact that we perceive it as being biologically based. In short, our ‘scientific objectivity’ when looking at sz is heavily permeated by dominant ideology. Leaving aside the question of how sz might be socially constructed, there are at least 2 ways is which sz is socially shaped (I think there is a distinction between socially ‘constructed’ and ‘shaped’). The first is the example you give above, of how the contents of delusions reflect on the times. 
The second, would be the impact of social variables such as social class, education, income, residence status, etc."

I for sure want to stay off of welfare. wouldn’t anybody? _NAME_
176128567,I will defend you here. To me if alcohol prevents you from having a good life you shouldn’t drink. It sounds like you are improving and you are better. I’m not condoning drinking though. I think it’s best to stop drinking all together but that’s just me. I love that you are improving and you are changing your life. I’m so proud of you. Well done.

174374758,"This is what I’ve always experienced with bipolar people They can tolerate their symptoms more than the meds We’re on the same/similar meds. Especially the szas, I mean, I think we’re a little more dependent on our meds. We get those same side effects as the bipolar people, us sz/a, but we say that the meds are more worth the side effects. Mania can be fun. Full blown schizophrenic psychosis isn’t fun to me in anyway. That’s probably one of the main reasons. I think we are humbled a little more to take meds by our illness. While bipolar people complain about the meds in front of the schizophrenic, the schizophrenic complains about “mentally ill people who don’t take meds”, in front of the bipolar. It is what it is I always like to say. Neither is better/ more right. But rather it is what it is."

176128587,"I was a heavy smoker for about 18 years. I quit 34 years ago by going through aversion therapy. Back in 1985 when I quit, the therapy cost was $275, almost exactly what my tax return was that year. Best money I ever spent. The program paid for itself in about 10 months(cigs were a lot cheaper back then). I had tried quitting at least 10-12 times before I actually succeeded. I tried cutting down slowly, cold-turkey, hypnotism, and acupuncture. Acupuncture got me from 30-40 cigs a day down to 5 a day no prob, but I just couldn’t quit until I did the aversion therapy. For anyone trying to quit smoking, don’t give up trying because you’ll find the best way for you. Keep trying until you succeed. You won’t regret it. It’s win-win. Better health and (bonus!) more money in your pocket!"

When it flies it laughs at me for thinking it could be mine. I see all the people with purpose. I can see their purpose. I try for a purpose but it eludes me. It looks back on me and scorns me for trying to have it myself. I see those with a plan and their plan unfolds for them. I see plans all around me but when I try for a plan it kicks me in the crotch and screams for help as it dissolves from having touched me. I see the ones that have someone to be with. I try to be with but ruin all withness and it frowns upon me as if I were the separation. I seclude myself but seclusion won’t have me either. It balks and squirms to be free of me. I am me but end up destroying what’s left of me to not be me. But none will have the not me either. So I am alone. But in aloneness I create company. My company hates me. Yet 
they stay only to torment me. I try to comfort them but they wish only to destroy. I ignore it but it doesn’t stop so I sleep. My sleep bothers those that become around me. They force me to be awake which then allows the company to be angry and continue my torment. Which becomes too much to have and be in this world as a participant. This upsets societally driven beings and they assert this upon me. So now its from every angle and I can’t hear what’s spoken to me over the cacophony inside but I try to remain present. It overwhelms and I get agitated which irritates me and I see the reason for my needed destruction. I take it out on others near me and hate myself more for it but can’t see it as such. Only confused rage builds until I can’t hold on any longer and the fuse passes the edge of the casing bringing outburst that has long lasting effect but is over so soon and I’m left confused scared shunned and alone left to wonder why I still am. Sadness returns only to mock me for I don’t have it it 
has me. I am the puppet emotion scrambled doth weild like a sword inset stone and only one may pull out. But nobody can and nobody comes so in there forever I stay til I see happy, laughing at me and I am scorned by all that see me. Never to be truly set free because nobody can care to reach me and try as I might my might isn’t there I’ve lost the ability to try to care. But aloneness won’t have me and I can’t have company because all the rotten it does to me. I am at a loss and lost I am still waiting to be found, an ant in the hill"

After that incident father took me from the church and rode with me about a kilometer from the church where he beat me up strongly, probably using belt. It was unpleasant. Another incident with paragelia took place when I was about 10. In TV I heard about a girl who was infected (HIV?) in a hospital. I started to laugh because of it although I did not want it. The laughter was quite loud. My father punished my by strong beating (maybe using belt) again."

Now I like to think now my enemies simply go nowhere when they die. Well they go to heaven but I get to “see” that they go to hell. So they go to hell for me but heaven for themselves. That way everyone is pleased. I dunno kind of a weird thing but in my idea of heaven everything is karmic. But my view of karma is totally different than someone else’s. It’d be greedy and selfish to say I was right they were wrong and they have to suffer for my bliss. So I’m consoled with that everybody is pleased. And it pleases me that everybody is pleased lol. In this theory I have now.

176128651,"I became dissociated (DP/DR) from pot as well as had a substance induced psychotic break. They call it ‘skunk weed’. I also tried _USER_ID_ and probably bought something years ago like something potent which ended up being a bad batch or was replaced with crap instead. I don’t know. But I cannot even remember clearly anymore or remember the details or it correctly. All I know is I became a believer in a higher power (God) and slowly converted to Christianity in 2017. I used to be an atheist and had an NDE up there. Went time traveling and interstellar basically. Seems like a past life. Not sure if I was teleported by ETs some where or went inter-dimensional lol. Like I had a really, really bad trip. Thought I was in a dream. Started questioning my reality. I can go on but rather not. Felt like I could have went to Mars, the 1970s, or some crap. Like Quantum Leap or Sliders the TV Shows. Jumpers too. I’ve seen aliens before. Real ones. I don’t know what else to say. I talk to people and go 
places in dreams. Like _NAME_ talks about and the ‘mk-ultra’ stuff. It’s controversial. Like I feel like I could have drank something tainted or smoked something that was laced. I have memories of a celebrity jokingly calling me a ‘vampire’ in a parallel universe. Makes me think of immortal time travelers and I woke up in my first life and discovered it. That was a billion + lifetimes ago. I also feel like I was that _NAME_ Tool guy in the song that got abducted by aliens in a past life/another planet. I have so much I experienced, it’s boring and borders insanity. I brought up _NAME_ because in every life I ‘try’ pot or something I get abducted by aliens and get schizophrenia. Maybe there’s a connection there."
176128652,"I hear what you are saying, i’m starting to change my habits, getting lazier (losing motivation), i’m trying not to but its draining, i think it might be depression, i reckon a lot of people feel the same way right now manalive, i pray things will get better for us, hopefully its just a momentary thing, take care."

176128659,"It would depend on the background of the patient. If they have a religious background then most of the delusions form in that guise. Then if their beliefs are magical (god) then undoing that religious paradigm would be even more difficult than an atheist for example. I mean if that person has been indoctrinated into magical thinking in the first place the additional sz thinking is just magic on magic. How can they gain insight without deprogramming religious indoctrination? An atheist can gain insight just by studying the ins and outs of scientific based sz studies which shows common delusions held by sz i.e disorganised thinking as illustrated by ‘knight moves’, voices shown on video of MRI scans showing the hearing lobe in action of sz patients when there is no noise and that nearly only sz patients have this brain action etc. What a person believes can only be taken apart if you study the individual and their individual experiences. A common universal cure is almost impossible to replicate."

176128685,"The worst thing is people who are unable to grasp that you have marked areas of cognitive strengths and weaknesses. It’s presumed, even by many MH professionals, that if you are verbally very intelligent and yet are struggling with something it’s because you are ,defiant, lazy, obstructive,passive aggressive etc. Another issue for many of us on the autistic spectrum is the gap between IQ and adaptive functioning. This forum plays to my strengths , but I’d be up the creek without a paddle if left completely to my own devices when it comes to day to day functioning."

You just need to discover your niche and run with it. Sensory overload was a problem for me. Another rule change at my old work was the banning of headphones, which I found to be very bad for me, as I cannot cope with the busy open plan office with all the noises and my brain trying to process every last thing people were saying. It’s too distracting without noise cancelling"
174374785,"YES WE CAN! I’m glad so many people responded! APs really have a bad rap for causing weight gain - I gained on both Abilify and Geodon, two of the meds that are supposedly better for not causing that. Now that I’m on Zyprexa, I’m making it my mission to lose my excess weight instead of gaining like most people do on it. I am determined! As long as I stay in my calorie range, it’s slowly coming off instead of gaining. We are powerful!"
174374783,You took the words out of my mouth. Well for me it’s been lack of telling people I have it that has driven people away. I make fast friends then I guess they sense something “off” about me - I’m secretive and vague and they just disappear as quickly as they enter my life. I have a few good friends that knew me during my teen years and have stuck by me through thick and thin. They didn’t know then but they know now and still love me. For that I’m grateful. I’m a recluse too so that’s off about me. I don’t trust anyone and I don’t let people close. I get lonely though and want people close but then they disappear. Its a no win situation. My mom told me not to tell the rest of my family. She told me that recently. I don’t know what to make of that really. She said they won’t believe it or understand. I really feel the people that truly care and are genuine will stick by. I think I’ll tell my family anyways.
176128696,"I was hospitalized a few times forcefully but I also went in to a place called Crisis Care at least half a dozen times voluntarily throughout my first few years with the disorder. Crisis Care isn’t a hospital, it’s a converted YMCA type building with a couple dozen bedrooms and a well stocked kitchen with a chef. It also had a nice courtyard and nice bathrooms. They had a doctor that could prescribe psychiatric meds visiting twice per week. It was not as scary nor did it draw in the same level of mentally ill patients as the hospital so I highly preferred it."

174374790,It really annoys me. Why can’t they just leave things alone. They’re trying to build a paper file on me for if things get bad again and they will take the decision out of my hands for good. Not impressed. I take my meds. Maybe one dose on one evening where I fell asleep early and forgot to take them in the past month Why do they have to be so insistent on Clozapine or depot?

176128710,"Congratulations on having regular meals and avoiding take away that must be a good feeling. That’s awesome that you got your son involved he will appreciate that when he gets older. I think it’s good to introduce that as habits early on. I myself have very recently added a pretty wholesome marmalade and soup stock with sugar in it, as weird as that sounds. It’s minimal added sugar for both though. And I’ve added things like hummus that I was avoiding before cos of the oil content. Generally I’m feeling very content at this stage but once I get to 68 kg, I will make my diet stricter. I’m beginning to think I want to be 60kg again (166cm) instead of 65kg Keep up the good job with the healthy eating it’s a worthy thing you’re doing."
176128711,"Ha, do I have to admit that I know what that is?"
176128712,"Either way you know its not real and not respond to those even if its psychosis, paranoia, delusion etc. Medications help to give some insight of the illness but rest of the work like not responding or not acting on it user themselves need to do. Certain substances can increase the risk of paranoia like dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin boosters. These are usually prescribed for ADHD, lack of motivation, depression etc but if have tendency towards paranoia then best is to avoid such things for safety reasons."

176128726,I’m sorry . 1515
174374793,"Ya my psychotic episodes start a lot like that but I too am able to kinda hold it together. Some people get defensive about sz because it’s a spectrum thing and some have it worse than others for one reason or another. A psych doctor will probably tell you that you have it. Psychosis doesn’t HAVE to be full blown end up in a straight jacket thing, but as you may have experienced it can be a detriment to your life. The fact is it’s good you’re asking, people aren’t born with schizophrenia it comes on later in life, we all have had a schizophrenic break more than likely, but I for one can’t pinpoint the exact moment it happened. There are a LOT of misconceptions about the condition. Schizophrenia as a term didn’t exist in a America until the nineteen fifties and was in fact mostly a carry over from Nazi scientists. Scary to learn for me but the whole modern concept of mental illness comes largely from _PERSON_ immediate followers and psychology as a whole was founded in what would becom
e Nazi Germany. Of course we know how that went but it has evolved since then. Not to say that mental illness didn’t exist beforehand but it was dealt with more often with other means. Like, brutal and exclusionary means. But not always. Big tangent. Sorry. But yeah there are some people that, schizo or not, are always gonna wanna one up you. Your condition doesn’t mandate you to be medicated like some peoples. Which is lucky or skilled or a combination of both. I think being introverted helps one to function in society longer with sz. But just my opinion."
176128727,"It was shocking. My life between 11 and 17 was absolute hell. My hometown was full of drugs, and I was exploited really badly. The first psychosis started about 16, and by time I was 17 I was in adult mental health, as here the child & adolescent mental health services didn’t deal with psychosis The life I have now is far, far better than when I was growing up. It does fill me with warranted paranoia about other people, but apart from that life is great off drugs and trying my best to look after myself and help my family where I can. This illness is just a further complication, but it’s by no means a death sentence."
176128728,My mother called the police on me numerous times - and stood up in crown court - and lied and said i battered her. I had a good lawyer and it got thrown out. Count yourself lucky. I could have done 3 years in _NAME_. Partly my fault for being a raving psychotic for years - cos the doctors at the time were arseholes and did not medicate me. And seeing an elderly woman - they took it as gospel. _PERSON_ enough tho - we get on now. So long as its just over the phone. Ive long since said - she has a PD herself. Best advice i can give - is dont be abusive if she kicks off - and keep your ruddy distance.

176128756,"I’ll try to lower the dose… but I am going to shoot for either seroquel or clozapine if in the end I have no choice but to take an antipsychotic. I am forced to take Abilify by injection now. Right now I have no rights and I would like to try a different antipsychotic but my doctor says there isnt very many options right now. I am challenging this legal battle with a review board and ill let you guys know how it turns out. Maybe ill be able to choose what medication I go on in the end. It really sucks, it does."
176128757,"Maybe aim your sights lower and get a new job with less status but also less stress. It’s nice having a professional position and working in a great company and having responsibilities and people depending on you, but even labor jobs can pay OK sometimes. It’s great to shoot for the stars but I’m a janitor and it’s the easiest job I know of and Federal minimum wage is about $10.00 an hour but I make $16.00 an hour. I like to encourage people and maybe a job like janitor won’t be good enough to survive on in your situation. But sometimes we have to swallow our pride and step down a few notches."

176128795,"Isn’t that funny? I feel like a failure compared to some people at my old early psychosis clinics who went on to lead successful lives. I haven’t gone off my antipsychotic since 2015, but the urge is always there. “What if I’m not sick? What if it was all a ruse to suppress my genius?” Can anyone else relate? And how does one work on the process of accepting this diagnosis? It feels absurd that I haven’t accepted it yet, compared to some people, but I just haven’t truly on a deep psychological level."

What followed in the ensuing weeks was me making a nuisance of myself on the forum. Then _AT_MENTION_ made a post complaining that a certain member was being “annoying”.

I ended up in front of a judge who must have been having a bad day or something, and I yelled at her that I thought I was being controlled by al qaeda and I was constantly being disruptive in the court room She sent me to the young offenders institute for 12 months, but immediately I was sent to the mental health hospital wing at a specialist centre. I was back in front of a more senior judge within a month, and he released me into the community, where I ended up in a local hospital, and given a 12 month rehab order. This rehab order changed my life, as I got clean. At the time my psychiatrist wanted to diagnose me with SZ, but they were not sure if it would return or not due to the amount of drugs in my system Couple of years later I stopped my AP, and within a couple more years (23 I think) things went to ???? again and here I am!"

What I’m saying is it is better now in my humble opinion. The hook makes more sense and your lyrics are more feasible. Good stuff. Keep it up. The delivery on the first sounded a little more natural though. Maybe listen to both and see what I mean? It doesn’t sound forced in the newer one, the flow just sounds a little different.

176128884,I take it everyday. It has helped me. It’s an oldie being a typical ap. I have a little side effects with it.
174374816,"I want to say that I needed to be taught what was the wrong thing to do. I could have listened to all the advice I’ve heard my entire life, how drugs can ruin your life, and all the terrible side effects. But without even putting any thought into it, I was using drugs everyday, as often as possible, and I didn’t even seem to realize it was a problem. When I was at my worst, I remember experiencing the most surreal paranoid thoughts, I felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t concentrate on anything except for things going on around me. It was like being trapped in a movie, and all eyes were on me. For the life of me, I couldn’t stop being distracted by intrusive thoughts. I wouldn’t take anything out of daily interactions aside for paranoid ideas and thinking that I was being spied on. My life was put on hold to facilitate a skewed perception of reality. Nothing made sense, and I had no idea what had happened… Every action I made I thought was being judged. I feel like the hallucinati
ons were so intense in my everyday life, that it was all I was paying attention to. It would make sense that I closed my minds eye, so that I didn’t have to re-live the horror in my head, after having already witnessed it. It would make sense that I was protecting my sanity by not thinking about anything at all. I feel like the delusions I was going through would cause my mind to implant paranoid beliefs in old memories, possibly to solidify my bizarre suspicions. For instance, I would try to convince myself that my entire life I was being spied on, and make connections between coincidences that random events were actually not random, but pre-planned and directed towards me. Perceiving the world around you doesn’t have to be as difficult as you’re making it out to be, as long as you are following some sort of guideline. I’m sure you didn’t always need one. Like you were able to naturally figure out the swing of things, after being thrown into a situation after 10 minutes or so, after getting acquain
ted with everything. But things are different now, you don’t have that quickly adapting mind anymore, and now you have to have a plan for everything. Hopefully not forever, but winging it might not be an option for you anymore. It’s like i took a chance driving on an unfamiliar road, and ended up some place that doesn’t exist anywhere but nightmares. When you think it’s time to start driving back home, you have another thing coming. You can’t find your way out. Start by understanding that you were not always in this nightmare. You just did something you probably shouldn’t have done, but how else were you going to find out what would happen? Maybe a drug induced brain damaged person is who you were meant to be in life. Or, could it be this is just another life lesson? But it’s like a lesson that is on repeat, maybe because you broke something, and can’t put it back together? Or is it because you haven’t learned the lesson, you are forced to keep living . I think life is a series of lessons th
at we either remember and move on to the next, or we keep trying the same lesson until we die, and after we die, we take what we learned to the next life. If this is true, then could the struggles we face be there to help us? If you are in school, angry that you have to learn something it would make sense that you would be distracted by your anger that you wouldn’t learn what you’re there for in the first place. Same would happen when you’re going through a hard time in life, and you are blaming everything but yourself for the root of the problem. Or just being so depressed with how things are working out, that you no longer look for the light at the end of the tunnel, and just believe it’s a myth. Seeing past the horrible parts of what life puts us through, and understanding that it is just a preparation for worse things to come, might make things not seem so heavy. How can you handle even harder problems, if you let the little ones break your spirit? You have a choice to think what you want. With me
, something I did caused some very scary thoughts, and I may have found a way to see through them. Even if they are still there, I know I cannot trust that they are real, and that removes their power. The ability to decide what is right and wrong is a gift that is given to everyone with a human brain. When it becomes impossible to tell the difference, is it time to think a little harder about what is happening, or abandon all hope and believe whatever thought is most prevalent, illogical as it may be? Ive read that congenitally blind people do not develop schizophrenia, and deaf people experience it by believing others are signing about them. Could this be an answer in disguise? Does this mean those of us who can see and hear, are going to be at the mercy of our senses? When they go out of whack, are they no longer advantages we have to being alive on this planet, but now curses that make life impossible to live comfortably? It seems we are capable of becoming prisoners of what we see and hear, depending on w
hether or not we develop schizophrenia. Could it be, since blind people are not able to upload a video file into their brain. This makes it impossible for them to upload corrupted information? Since there is no visual delusion to be had, there can’t be a hallucination to throw the mind into an altered reality. Could our eyes and ears end up becoming our worst nightmare? There is a quote, “Believe half of what you see, and nothing of what you hear” If you do this. Would it be true that 50% of what you see isn’t the truth before it even comes into your field of view? It is already 50% BS before it walks into your life? So are you judging what you see by 25% truth 25% false? And I would have to assume that I am at least 50% wrong in the decisions I make during my life. Could I end up only seeing 12.5% truth? Does this mean that seeing isn’t really believing? If a door to door salesman rings your bell in anticipation of selling you a bottle of cleaner. Is he already half lying to you before you even ope
n your door? You are already wrong in at least half of the decisions you make over the course of your lifetime. So what is the percentage of truth in what you are witnessing, and what is the likelihood you are making the right decision on what you are perceiving. Our memories are all we have to guide us, in life. We literally record video with our eyes, and save it in our brain. What happens when we lose recordings? Sometimes it feels like I can’t find memories as well as I used to. Could I have damaged my minds eye, lost my memories, or have I closed my minds eye, and I don’t know how to open it again? I believe what is happening is similar to having a camera and dvr system. We are able to record video and save it to a hard drive. With our eyes and brain. Then when we need to get through a certain life event, we replay what we saved previously and use that same scenario to get through what we are dealing with. But what happens when we have damaged recordings, cannot access the playback feature, and are o
nly working with live view? It would make sense that judging the world around you is going to be a lot harder, if you can’t access memories that remind you of what to expect. For example. If you had a business where your cameras record outside your store, and for the past 2 years, Monday-Friday there is a homeless man that spends his mornings walking around your parking lot. You know what to think about this because you have the recordings, you are confident there is no threat. But, what happens when you delete the recordings? Now, when you see the homeless man, it is the first time you saw him, and your mind is working to figure out what he could be doing there. Where if, you had saved the video files of him, you would be onto thinking about the next thing… and not dwelling on a mundane event that holds no serious grip on your future. So what happens when you can’t use your memories to guide you in life, when you’ve closed your minds eye? I know that not thinking at all, can completely detach you fro
m what made you who you are. “All you know is all you are.” When you stop using what you know, what do you become? Could it be making it worse, when we close our mind off from replaying traumatic events? Are we turning everything off, even the thoughts that were never harmful? Is this not allowing us to learn from the mistakes in judgment we are making?"

If I happen to be listening to something else - music from _PERSON_, a TV show, nothing happens. I explained this to my doctor and she said with these voices your mind is in a very heightened state, and somehow that creates the voices and even make it possible for them to respond to whatever your thinking. I know they are not real I just can’t explain why my phone only shuts down during those times."

God belief is pretty pivotal too. The next place will be incredibly hard to discern as a simulation, if it is at all.

176129053,"I am untidy, “lazy”, impulse prone and needy. I don’t like where I am, and it seems bleak to think that it can be improved on. But, it’s about how you cope and manage. I’ve found, the tidying hasn’t improved, but I work harder to tidy. So even though I make a mess of my belongings, I work “hard” (if I may say so) to actually tidy it up. “Lazy” is more demotivated. But I keep pushing myself to continue with the routine I have. Three days of the week I go into uni, and two days of the week I go into work. Impulse prone; I will say and do as I wish. I try to check myself, but this is a skill - just do less things and it isn’t an issue. Needy - this one is funny because it is more how others, if they get to know me, will see me. At first glance I seem far from needy, but as soon as I open up. It’s all needy. I tackle this by closing myself off from people and also by hoping to be self sufficient. I am trying my best to work for income and study for future income. Even if the fut
ure doesn’t materialise, I am actively trying to focus on having things to do — this will nullify the needy psychology in my mind; a result of feeling weak. It’s the same for everyone. If you feel weak or less when compared to someone else; you become prone to wanting to be more (this is what needy is). I don’t want any of the above traits to define me. My personality should be what it was before I got ill. It should be a representation of the things I strive for. The way to attack this problem (for me) is to become interested in topics that add to my character. (It could be the autism in me but) I think , as long as I have interests that I pursue - I will feel better about myself and engage in less comparison to others of my age or my peers. I hope everyone overcomes the damage of psychosis: because psychosis really distorts or restarts how grown up and mature and flexible and able the mind is. God willing, by the time I hit 35; i should be a much better man than I am now."

EA Carbone, V Pugliese, A Bruni, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of affective disorders , Aug 2019 19 Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are risk factors for psychiatric disorders, but evidence about their relationship with clinical severity is limited. We aimed to classify patients according to ACEs and to compare these clusters with regards to the clinical severity.Seventy-four patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) and 91 patients with a diagnosis within the Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSDs) were interviewed. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse scale (CECA) and the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) were administered. A two-step cluster analysis was run to identify clusters according to ACEs. PANSS average scores were compared between clusters.Three clusters emerged; significant differences in A
CEs distribution were evident. Cluster 1 was characterized by very low frequency of ACEs. ACEs related to lack of support/isolation were more frequent within Cluster 2, instead ACEs related to abuse/neglect were over represented in Cluster 3. The comparison of PANSS through ANOVA demonstrated that Cluster 3 not only had significantly higher scores in all dimensions than Cluster 1 and 2 but also a higher average number of ACEs.CECA is a self-report scale and is subject to recall bias.Specific ACEs are related to clinical severity among BD and SSD patients. Early life adversities related to abuse and neglect are associated to greater symptomatic severity than those related to lack of support/isolation. Our findings suggest that a history of ACEs could be used to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable clinical features."

176129125,"That was a good article. The authors are thinking about us and how we get our support. They say we may have needs but sometimes due to our illness we reject others. But support is very important for our health. They talk about all sorts of people who can provide support, and talk about the psychiatrist as a source of connection, if the relationship is good. They say we may need “quality” relationships. They mention how _USER_ID_ hurts. The authors say we should look at the process of “identifying, offering, accepting and rejecting support.” I know I need my support system."

174374905,"I reckon they got FTL. Because…we’re still pretty primitive…type 0 civilization. I reckon there are at least type 1 civilizations out there and I may have been or seen type 1 before in my past lives. Type 1 is pretty strong but they got higher levels that are hard to understand or comprehend. They don’t want us to figure out or know we live in a computer simulation or program. I know because they told me this before in my past lives. They would probably destroy us. I’ve seen equations for FTL (don’t know if they were real or just hypothetical or theoretical). Based on my readings, they can manipulate space-time, teleport, use holograms (as a defense, I guess), and transfer the mind or consciousness and even upload it. If we live in a simulation, I guess all this is elementary for them. I’ve seen and met the computer simulators and even been out of the simulation several times in my past lives. They got time travel too which is FTL in my opinion. I’ve experienced this all and possibl

176129153,"The common trap is people have their initial break and become psychotic and are maybe hospitalized and maybe go through a period of “crazy” behavior or weird thoughts and then they get put on meds. The meds make them feel better and they feel so good that they think they don’t need meds anymore, not realizing they only feel better because of the meds. So this category of people often relapse until they realize they need to stay on meds to feel better. They don’t go off meds planning to be psychotic, it just happens. If they’re lucky they only have to do this process once in order to learn they need meds. Unfortunately for some people they have to go on the cycle a few times before they learn."

My first label was paranoid schizophrenia, so that may be why he chooses that one. I was more honest about my history and brought my dad to an appointment. My mood does limit me. I go through episodes of depression, mania, psychosis. But I think because I react badly to anti-depressants is why he wants to keep it at schizophrenia, so that would limit the types of meds I can be put on? The issue is I am seriously wanting to be put on Prozac, but I think it would likely do what it did to my mom or make me worse. It would be really nice if I Could be put on a medication that helps. There are lots of people who get worse on anti depressants, makes me think of all the shootings with schizophrenics and they find out they were put on anti-depressant drug cocktails before it happened. I’m not the violent type but I could become psychotic again. I get c
onfused about what it means to have schizophrenia. Because I don’t have hallucinations all the time, but I am constantly battling this disease. Fear/paranoia/nightmares/conspiracies/being niave and gullible/drug addiction etc. I am 100 percent certain that schizophrenia is what caused my addiction. I never used drugs before I had schizophrenia. Although sometimes I speculate severe trauma and assault triggered my first episode, I still have schizophrenia. Even if I was roofied and raped and don’t remember it; hospitalized and forced medications until I became catatonic, I’m sure the system did not create my chronic illness."

174374933,"They said "" the very interesting thing with sz and cognition is that its becoming more recognized as a CORE EFFECT "" This is correct and corresponding with the actual reality of the SZ ,regardless they do not determine who is the cause or the result the cognitive change is gripping the end of the thread which ultimately lead to the beginning of the thread in the sz,the change does not occur in anatomical structure like what is happens in all classical organic diseases,but it happen in the cognitive data The fundamental change occurs in the content of the mental concepts ,which acquired by self-experiences and imprinted in a person’s memory ,and can be called and used in understanding the world of events,phenomena inside oneself or outside in the environmental world Change occurs in the concept of mental symbols,thoughts,mental message,data,information or personal beliefs about the world of things or the cognitive signals, self-knowledge …etc (the change has occurs ONLY in any personal attempt 
to using the self-knowledge to deal with the internal effects or the external stimuli ) There is no any classical organic disease creates a radical change in the self-knowledge content ,personal believes about the world of most things comparable to the changes introduced by sz’s pathogen the main task that precedes any practical procedure,it is to make every effort to know all possible details about the essential nature of the change that take place in the cognitive material ,in a manner that matches what actually occurs at the level of the mental processes which precede the production of any mental response,behavioral or the emergence of any feeling"
176129248,"Vraylar had some very sh*tty results in the first trial they did. So bad that the Food & Drug Administration told the pharma company to take a hike. They did another couple of studies of which there was marginal improvement, and FDA approved it. FDA has been big on approving new antipsychotics even if they’re not very helpful because of a lack of choices. I’ve spoken to three pdocs about it. None of them use it except when it’s almost a last-option. It kinda makes sense considering the above that Vraylar is scarcely mentioned."

176129263,I’ve dated before but I’ve never been in a real relationship. I’d like to try dating again. I haven’t dated really in 5 years or so. Hopefully it’d lead to a relationship though. I’d see how that goes for a bit. Then I’d tell you if it’s better to be single or in a relationship but I have nothing to compare it to. I’m happy being single as it is. Although at least would like to try dating. I don’t feel comfortable where I live with talking to Anyone. Maybe it’s paranoia. Sometimes I think changing where I live would reverse the paranoia. I wonder how I’ll do in Florida in a fresh environment im leaving in 2 days for a week to be there

176129275,Depakote has antipsychotic properties. But it’s a big weight gaining med.
176129276,"I think a lot of people are misunderstanding _AT_MENTION_’s point. We need to understand why men become radicalized by incel rhetoric. It’s true that women have an easier time than men finding partners in straight relationships. It’s true that suicide is the leading cause of death in young men in the UK. It’s true that men are socialized not to express any emotions other than anger, and to not discuss deep problems with anyone besides a romantic partner. It’s true that men with no romantic partner to discuss things with tend to isolate and have worse mental health. It’s important to recognize and understand the path that leads men towards radicalization, so we can prevent others from falling into these dangerous traps. There are only two ways to get rid of an extremist. One is by killing them, which is illegal, immoral, and will only serve to further radicalize the other members of the group. The other is by deprogramming them from their brainwashing, and getting them to understand that 
they can be loved and accepted by others, as long as they start treating people with respect."

I’m not going to try to say whether or not you’re a schizophrenic, though. You have to live your life the best way you can, but your mind can play a lot of tricks on you."

176129296,"If you are feeling frustrated sometimes you just want to throw up your hands and say “forget it” Sometimes it’s hard to keep fighting so hard when you feel like you aren’t getting anywhere. Do you think that could have anything to do with it? That’s how I feel sometimes. Almost like it’s pointless because I don’t feel like I will ever get any better, so why bother, But then I really try to remember how bad it is without the meds and I talk myself into staying on them. But it’s a fine line sometimes."
176129297,"I begged for Antabuse years ago (Disulfiram) but never ever got it. At the end of the day - it just takes willpower. I go about 3 months or so - but i will usually pick a drink up after a while, then feel guilt and remorse and have a new quit date."

176129301,"Posted question. avvo.com. They said post question like that because the government and police can track my computer down. This is what he said “If you get in trouble and it could be years until you know, a good argument by your lawyer could be made that the child was fully clothed since being in a bikini would hide all. That being said the cops can also look at the search terms you used as everything on your computer can be traced and monitored by the government including this website where you should never post any information about even a possible crime. If charged or questioned hire a lawyer immediately…” So whats the point of asking questions on avvo. This is what other lawyer said “As Mr. _PERSON_ said cops troll this cite. Do not admit anything. Also remember that charging you just requires probable cause (more likely than not). To convict it is beyond a reasonable doubt. If they knock on the door do not say anything. Do not try to explain. Do not try to defend yourself. Refuse to ta
lk or answer questions without an attorney. You can sit an worry for 5 years. Not wise.” Did i make mistake by asking question about what i did."
176129302,"Latuda will help. I’ve had very similar delusions. Nothing like solipsism or anything where I’m the only one that is real or exists, but most likely because I’m “special” lol!!! (I prefer being “different” due to a past life memory over being special). I used to be a computer simulator i.e. someone creating our reality, but that was a long time ago. I read a lot of _NAME_ k dick online and from wikipedia and sometimes I thought I was a machine or replicant or even a cylon from Battlestar Galactica. I’m not, but it’s fun to think about and laugh about. I’m sure some people believe in that sort of thing and who knows maybe they will in the future when we find out we live in a sim or something or that aliens exist. But that would be bad and scary. People might need to take their meds like we do haha. Anyways, good luck with Latuda. It didn’t work for me, only Vraylar, but that doesn’t mean Latuda won’t do wonders for you!"

176129311,"Right? I understand _NAME_’s thought process but I’ve only visually hallucinated like that a few times. Maybe 5-10 times. Mostly during my prodrome phase. I recently experienced tactile hallucinations and that was unnerving. I do experience more of the perception changes. Like shifts in someone’s face. It’s more of a grimace or sneer when someone isn’t making it at me. Also, I have great difficulty talking but not writing. When I take medication my symptoms improve and my communication greatly improves and I can talk like a human being again."

Every dose we tried before, 20, 15, and 10, caused akathisia. Can you try lowering your dose? Even a small reduction can eliminate akathisia if you’re lucky. It’s a horrible side effect, almost as bad if not worse than the condition the medicine is treating."

176129348,"It’s so unfair, we have to have these side effects to maintain our lives with dignity and without the symptoms. I am on Abilify 10mgs. I don’t feel like its working enough either. I feel dismissed. Like they don’t take my illness seriously. Like its a sham, it feeds into my paranoia. I want something to knock out the voices and the ringing in my ears. Partly I feel my illness is neurological and trauma-based. But also episodes cause trauma. It’s just that I’m tired of remembering trauma. I know ECT would probably make me worse, but I want a pill that just blocks things better. Abilify just makes me feel better, its more like a hypnotic or anti-anxiety. But it does not quell the psychosis or paranoia."

176129350,I was on valproic acid for several years along with risperidone and it helped stabilise my moods.

176129379,We have to live with them. Sometimes I quarrel with them sometimes I bear with them. Live people comment on me harshly and these people are present there even when I am travelling on road. It is better to talk with those who has kind heart for you. Things are really complex how to tackle those people who are commenting on you and on your family members.

I have come such a long way and know the death sentence I thought this illness was, was only a lie i believed."
176129384,"Psilocybin has already had promising results for people with MDD: [“The results from previous studies clearly demonstrate the remarkable potential for psilocybin as a treatment in MDD patients, which Usona is now seeking to confirm in its own clinical trials,” says Usona’s director of clinical and translational research, _NAME_. “What is truly groundbreaking is FDA’s rightful acknowledgement that MDD, not just the much smaller treatment-resistant depression population, represents an unmet medical need and that the available data suggest that psilocybin may offer a substantial clinical improvement over existing therapies.”]"

176129386,"I remember when I was 30 years old and I was staying in a group home. I drank beer since high school but in 1990 I was just getting serious about getting clean and sober. I was a crack addict. One day I was walking down the street with someone I knew and we ran into this guy who I had met in another group home. We talked and he asked us if we wanted to get some beer, so 7-11 was right up the block and we got a few six-packs and went behind some cars in a parking lot to drink it. We were sitting down and I had a beer in my hand and I looked at my beer and something struck me out of the blue and I said out loud, “This is the last beer I’ll ever drink”. That was 1990 and I have not drank one beer since then."

176129398,"I spent over a year with my voices saying “I love you” over and over. I went without my Zyprexa for two days and the voices started threatening to kill me and calling me awful names which I won’t repeat. Went back on the Zyprexa, now it’s just “I love you” again. I don’t recommend coming off meds, if you feel they are causing you too many side effects I recommend asking your psychiatrist if you can lower your dose slightly. My brother is right now in heavy psychosis telling us he’s a gifted psychic who is hearing spirits tell him not to take medicine. Tell me how you would propose helping this young man without medicine. Personally I’m ready to have someone go in and forcefully inject him because his illness is threatening to derail the lives of those around him. He just won’t listen."

174374959,"Gravity is one of the greatest mysteries in physics. No one knows what causes it. It could be a particle known as a graviton or it could be some sort of probability wave via _PERSON_’s Equation but no one knows for sure until a particle or singularity is discovered and analyzed. As for dark energy/matter, it interacts with actual matter so weakly that it almost cannot be measured. I hypothesize that this could be the link to the human soul, and through some sort of quantum fukery we are linked to this matter and our experiences are locked away in a “save state” of sorts. Maybe thats where your past lives came from, or it could be delusion. Either is just as likely. All I know is that we dont know anything man, the more questions are answered the more are created and well never see the end because we as humans cannot comprehend what created us, it simply is not possible for a part of the universe to comprehend the whole, to do such would mean the entire universe is encapsulated in our brain, w

176129401,I’ve noticed I experience it more if I fall asleep after I’ve had alcohol. I totally get auditory hallucinations during it. I’ve gotten used to it so most of the time I can stay calm during but it can be hard when the hallucinations are scary. The other day when I was at my boyfriend’s and he was in the bathroom and I was paralyzed I kept hearing the bedroom door open even though no one was coming in. Then I heard a man laughing. Then I heard a baby crying. So weird.
176129402,I also am in torment 24/7 I developed really bad thought disorder since December and it torment me everyday I use to be at peace even with schizophrenia but I do feel I’m getting slightly better I can only hope that I continue to improve

176129432,Hi I have this irrational fear of getting a wart or warts on my body and genitals. When I was a teenager I had a wart on my thumb and I was really anxious as it was in front of my fave when I was writing anything at school or using a phone. It was also the bigger one. I also 16 months ago had an unprotected sex with a girl that had genital warts but they were treated. Somehow I still have this fear of developing warts even so many months have passed. Anyone else have this irrational fear of getting a wart?

176129441,Most antipsychs like Risperdal can be sedating. I take antidepressants in the morning…anti psychs at night. The ad’s can be activating and give you a boost but we are all different. IT’s not uncommon to sleep a lot on our meds.
176129442,I tried so so many antidepressants none have worked for me might be time to try again
176129443,I used to think there was a reason for all the crap experience…is there any logic to it
176129444,I do unfortunately. But I feel it’s from the medication not my illness because when I was I’ll I didn’t experience any negative symptoms. The only positive experience I had was delusional thinking I thought I heard people talking about me but then I realized I was misinterpreting what they were saying. It wasnt about me at all. People are too busy to be talking about others in that way when I came out of it. But they weren’t the only delusions I had. I thought my neighbor was spying on me putting things in the walls and such

Hospitals are good when you can’t stay safe on your own, but I don’t know anybody who has thrived by living there permanently. Has your therapist recommended anyone new yet? I know how much of a gamble it can be to try a new therapist, but if it is someone your current therapist knows and trusts, odds are high that they will have a similar style. And you can ask your therapist to meet with the new therapist to familiarize them with your history so you don’t have to re-explain everything again."

176129452,I would say be careful because when I start feeling things that aren’t there it’s the beginning of a severe episode and I know it’s time to go to the hospital before it gets full blown and they find me walking miles from home.
176129453,Are you ok? Are you at the hospital?
176129454,_AT_MENTION_ got good results from this as well I think

Turns out maybe someone from another floor might have flushed a wipe down one of the toilets, but at least it didn’t hold us up too much. There’s one problem yet to face though: on Friday, we’re expected to get 5 cm of snow, and we still haven’t got someone lined up for sure to plow Mom’s driveway if it happens. There’s going to be a lot to do, but I’ve been through this kind of thing before. Will keep you all posted!"

176129458,"If you qualify for an ABLE account you can save a fair amount of money. (although once the government caught wind of it they lowered the total you could save below what some states were offering.) If you don’t you are limited to $2,000 for SSI and something like $3,000 for SSDI. You are also limited to the car you have when you apply with the next one limited in price. They also limit the housing you can have. There is a push to improve that but in this political climate it’s questionable how far it will go. The reason for these limitations is that up to now the US government hasn’t believed in socialized medicine so if your working age they punish you for using it for medical help so everybody doesn’t apply and it becomes that."

176129465,"yeah, driving though is out of hand these days. I’ve gone over in this cul-de-sac to my neighbor guy’s house, his teenagers there, and brought him an unopened bag of macedamia cookies, and asked nicely for those kids to slow down when they come in here, there’s little kids in about every house, and some parents might be telling them they can play, but don’t leave the court.

174374983,My pdoc won’t take me off my haldol shot BC he says that the psychosis will come back. I’ve been off it for 4 months before and nothing happened. I just wish he had more faith in me like I have faith in myself and in God that I will be okay without medication. He says I’ll be on it forever. But I literally don’t have any symptoms on or off medicine. The only side effects I have is breast enlargement and irregular periods. I don’t even feel like I have schizophrenia.

It is indeed possible, and it does take time. But it can be done"

The happiest people I’ve ever been around! I let the firefighter thing lapse. It wasn’t for me. But the dance thing felt like ‘my Mount Everest’. The biggest theme in my life has been trying to combine business and pleasure. Otherwise I can’t separate, I can’t earn the money and spend the money, I can’t parry or pivot.

176129489,They dont care. They are busy they got other things to do.
174374985,"It’s truly scary to me that AI is going to be in everything, including schizophrenia. If progress is being stalled or slow I hope it’s for ethical reasons. But my beginning was that I didn’t have it. It took years."
176129490,"I’m listening to music and that helps. Thank you for the nice messages, _PERSON_"
176129491,Afraid of what I might hear. Music knows what I’ll hear. It’s predetermined.
176129492,"????, it is what it is, but is it really so unworthy?"
176129493,Thanks for the thoughts peeps
174374981,Getting some aberrant salience syndrome doesnt sound all that bad to me

176129496,I take Geodon. I take the maximum recommended dose and have now for about four years now. I have been on it for over 10 years. My prolactin is fine.
176129497,"You are. You go back and forth with your symptoms, so you are still sick"
176129498,yeah definitely a trait of mine
174374986,"Strangely enough even though my positive symptoms are terrible, I am doing a lot of good things for myself. I slowly keep adding more activities. A month ago I started a daily poetry habit (haven’t been perfect, but close to it). Then I started doing an art kit I got for christmas. Then I started practicing instruments I learned growing up again. Now I’ve added going outside and getting exercise and fresh air. I’d like to plant some flowers next."
176129499,Im not sure if i remember mine or who it was. I have a vague idea but no memory of it. I was a spaceball
176129500,what cures a guilty consciousness?
176129501,"Yes, you could step off a curb and get run over by a bus tomorrow or you may live another 50 years. Life is a crap shoot at best, no one gets out alive. And everybody goes through periods of hopelessness and questioning their purpose or their life. We’re all vulnerable to life and it’s ups and downs. It sucks but you just keep going; you play the cards you are dealt. Hell, I got nothing going for me but I still go to work each day and try to have a little fun along the way. Believe me, I know about suffering and feeling suicidal and feeling hopeless. I was psychotic for two and a half years straight when I was 19-21. I was in a hospital for 8 months. I was in a psyche ward and they chained me to a table. It sounds pretty hopeless but things got better. I’m still unhappy a lot but I also have many good moments throughout the day. Life is unpredictable, I never could have predicted that I would ever work again. But now I’m looking back on being employed almost steadily since 1983. Compared to 
when I was 19 my life is a 100% better. Because I didn’t give up. You’re going to have dark days, but things get better for lots of people. If your goal is to be happy every day, it ain’t going to happen. But you can still get something out of life."
176129502,My psycb says it takes 3 months to exit my body
176129503,"Yeah, its possible, but dont pay attention. Its important now, that you just have this disability… I also knew the mocking even from my family and friends, but maybe we’ll surprise them one day with things, that they cant do, but we can hah Its not a big deal if i take a bit of klonopin these 5 days before my commission, isnt it? After it, ill reduce it…"
176129504,Thanks for your prayers…Thanks. You are in our prayers as well. I know you too are having a hard time.

176129508,"I know you think everyday you are going to die and the nation is watching you. Well I fear that I will die today I heard people plan and say they are going to kill me. They know where I live I think. They put images in my head, I hope my friend will be ok. I should just go outside and get shot. I won’t be safe in a hospital. I don’t know who these people are. Do you have any ideas? I wish I lived by myself or could drive and visit my parents. I would have called the police."
176129509,Sunlight is good
176129510,Nothing scares me about my energy moving into the universe. What worries me is more scared of living. For years my paranoia made me live in fear of life. That really blows and I make sure that these days I live as large as I can.
174374990,I’m on 500mg and I drool. But everyone reacts differently to meds so maybe you just lucked out.
176129511,Well 9000 is a very good starting point. Do you have a park near by / or a non-busy street near you that could do more walking at? Diet isn’t always the only answer it is exercise and diet that normally helps.
176129512,"200lb is the lowest I have been after sz but before sz my weight was 140-145lb muscle. Before sz I was going to the gym for 2h daily, sometimes twice in a day. I was also following a low carb low fat high protein diet."
176129513,Do you read books? I like spiritual non fiction non religious
176129514,"I don’t have that. I’ve had a few moments when I’ve planned to search something online , and it’s completely slipped my mind . When you get to 60 or so it can be easy to think something untoward is going on. Tested myself at the Food for the brain site . I performed at or above the norm for my age ."
176129515,Wow! That’s actually great news!!!
176129516,"If you are only on 5 mg, and only for 3 months, the withdrawal shouldn’t be bad. Did your doctor tell you to stop taking it?"
176129517,"Man, that sucks!"
174374991,_AT_MENTION_ Is the abilify helping with symptoms?
174374993,"It takes abilify 10mg , 2 weeks to reach a steady state in your body. So it’s your decision to wait until then or visit the hospital."
176129518,"Before my parents divorce, but then I wouldn’t trade it because I have my brother. But ya, I had a great childhood I just don’t remember living it again. I feel like I cannot remember much of being alive or conscious before I graduated high school. I don’t know. It’s all too fishy. Like I’m a clone. I feel like if I was age regressed and went back in time, I could change my fate or destiny too easily. It hasn’t happened yet. I had my tether ball, my german shephard, and my schooling. I just felt so, so dissociated all the time. Like very low level of consciousness or conscious awareness like it was a child thing or part of the evolutionary thing all humans experienced. It would be weird if even half of what I said and thought was in this life and not another life. I just know I did ???? in school my whole life, played video games, and rode my bike. I was of very low IQ. I had stomach problems and watched tons of TV. Missing time, forgetfullness, and missing time. Feels like I wasn’t a
live before high school. I would love to go back in time and undo all this f*ckery. I feel like I’ve been to another planet. My body is the same but my mind is different. It’s like a quantum parallel world – computer program."

176129522,So you hallucinated a Jesus look alike that’s weird.
176129523,I hate that… when will I get relief
176129524,"Partly is life issues such as marital separation, but also the sheer strength of the negative and cognitive symptoms."
176129525,Is your husband on an AP? By the way these controlling symptoms were nonexistent prior to the use of the AP The AP seemed to help put it at bay
176129526,_PERSON_ and you get 3 weeks a year in psychiatric hospital !!
174374992,"That’s what I am unsure about, I will ask my pdr about it and I am not even sure if he knows it: Does Abilify treat negative symptoms or it only causes less because it blocks dopamine less than other meds? I know that Abilify is a weaker ap vs other meds like Risperdal and Clozapine etc because it blocks dopamine less than these. My pdr apt is this week, I will ask him and report here."
176129527,"I wonder what exactly antipsychotics do to me. Maybe they make voices milder and quieter and better in content? I mean without meds I would still have voices, but they would be offensive, aggressive and non stop?"
176129528,"Every month, when I go to my pdoc, he weighs me and every damn month, I am one kg fatter. What the hell? Now i am 113 kgs, fatter than ever"
176129529,She doesn’t know what to put me on i think she thought the meds were making me worse in some ways . I dunno. I’ll try calling her
176129530,"Yeah it is good. Im the type of person that blares out Choral music anyway. My support worker i speak with is trans-gender, so she understood my name change more than most of the others."

176129534,I’m just very concerned about you. How is your pain level? The tattoo sounds super cute
176129535,I used catch myself listening hard to try and hear them. But I’ve grown since then and am not paralyzed trying to listen anymore. But it still frustrates me daily because I have so many questions and I can’t hear the replies
176129536,You are not alone
176129537,hey that’s really smart
176129538,"this has been sticking in my crawl for months, ever since the debates. and in fact even longer a decade or more. _NAME_ bloomberg says there is nothing to farming, you plant the corn, you water the corn and it grows. is that right? he’s not seeing what im seeing. like miles and miles of cornfields throughout the midwest. i can’t help but wonder why all this valuable farmland is being used to grow a crop with little nutritional benefit. could it be because it’s cost effective and profittable. i mean you use big farm equipment to seed it, let nature do its thing, and then use big farm equipment to harvest it some months later and it’s relatively low labour intensive. this is ????????, it’s driving me crazy, i want to be like california, with orchards and groves, vineyards, and vegetables, like salad greens with more nutritional benefit. at the worst we can at least grow beans. am i wrong? honestly am i wrong? is it not possible here? this has been driving me crazy for a decade. i think _NAM
E_ bloomberg misses the point, he is probably fattening up the calf and eating steak or something. and thats what im talking about to heck with it, im going to go get some popcorn haha."
176129539,"yes. that’s how I was diagnosed, it was forced speech, uncontrollable, automatic, upon waking each morning, it was more like ranting, couldn’t get rid of it. So I went first time to psychiatrist, told him about this, and also my beliefs, got a diagnosis, got on Risperdal, and after two days, this forced speech was gone. And I just smiled from then on in peace waking up every day."
176129540,"This makes no sense. If I’m cutting into one part, I’m not cutting at all. This also makes no sense. If we cut a number into zero parts, again, were not cutting at all. The number should stay the same. 0 + 1 = 1 … 1 / 0 = 0 … What? But you just said … I dont think you understand the terms properly… If we’re not going back or forward, where are we going? Time surely doesn’t stand still."
176129541,Answered very well
174374996,"Yes, you are most welcome here. Welcome to Sz.com!"
176129542,Well that is why I made this thread. You can look through what others do and try their strategies. It’s like a Coping Store!
176129543,"Firstly, _AT_MENTION_, I must admit I’m not a big Eagles fan, although maybe I’d like to be. As far as depriving myself, for someone on a minimal fixed income, I’m practically rich. It would be nice to take a course in something like existentialist philosophy, just out of general interest. From what I’ve read about it online, it gets a lot of life right."
176129544,Very cool. I used Adobe Photoshop a lot when I was working. Mostly for advertising banners and website graphics. I always found stuff like that a lot of fun
176129545,"Pretend the voice is yours and say something out of it, they might think its their own thoughts but you could tell them “I dont want to mess with this guy anymore”"
174374997,"I’ve worked at one place so far since my initial psychotic break. The job caused me a great deal of stress and eventually it came down to either quitting or facing another hospitalization, so I quit. Looking for something else now though."
176129546,I just hate having to deal with all of this. I am pretty busy and also going in front of a judge makes me really nervous.
176129547,"reminds me of the quote by _NAME_ no one is free even the birds are chained to the sky I always seem to remember tht one up to now but still I feel like my prison sucks lol but I wonder wat life wud be like if I wasn’t in prison he makes a point somewhat in ur clip but still, my prison really sucks lol"
174374995,"If anybody has tried Vraylar and Abilify together, please let me know. I want to go there with at least two combinations in mind."
176129548,"I took every kind of supplement you could think of, yep i lost faith in them too"
176129549,"Got to go out today. My rent check came yesterday. For my house in the city. I have to put it in the bank. Also going to pick up medication for my dogs. Hope my service dog in training is suppose to get her yearly check up, and shots on April 10. Don’t know what it is going to be like then. So Hope will be getting that taking care of today."

176129553,So you know it’s not intrusive if you find the thought of hurting someone pleasant?
176129554,I tend to selfisolate too.
176129555,"Now I don’t think I can be stable on 15mg, maybe not. I want to try but Abilify is a no no for me. I am stuck with severe negative symptoms and Risperdal 4mg until Vraylar becomes available here. Maybe Vraylar won’t work for my positive symptoms as its very weak, weaker than Abilify and Latuda, but I am willing to go above the max dose of 6mg."

176129557,That sounds like more like delusions _AT_MENTION_ . What I was asking was did your VOICE follow their own story?
176129558,I am yet to receive any medication. I am looking where I can buy sarcosine locally.
176129559,I feel this sometimes too
174375005,"Forgive my laziness, but I am copying a reply I just put on another thread about Zyprexa - I have been on Zyprexa since mid-March. I started at 5 mg, went to 10 mg, and then my pdoc and I discovered that 7.5 mg is my lowest effective dose. I’ve been on 7.5 mg for almost two months. Even on 7.5 mg, my positive symptoms are completely controlled. I used to have breakthrough hallucinations on Haldol, and I haven’t had any on Zyprexa. It even controls what used to be disabling paranoia and delusions. I haven’t been troubled with anything. I haven’t had diabetes, though I haven’t had bloodwork done since starting Zyprexa, but I feel fine. I don’t eat a lot of sweets. I have lost 25 pounds since starting Zyprexa, by calorie counting between 1200-1400 calories per day. I was afraid of the weight gain, and I wanted to lose a significant amount I gained on previous APs, so I started off aggressively fighting weight gain. The Zyprexa has been limiting my appetite instead of stimulating it, so I a
m staying to a low calorie range with no problem. Zyprexa has been my miracle drug. I am completely under control, and looking for a full-time job to get off disability. I don’t know who said 7.5 mg is not enough for sz, I am sza so maybe that makes a difference? Regardless, 7.5 mg works wonders for me!"

176129571,"Honestly if I did, I don’t remember them so they couldn’t have been good friends. I always made friends with troubled people though, so they’ve been there for me like I’ve been there for them. I’m very fortunate I think. Blessed even really. I’m sorry you guys lost friends"
176129572,"Oh no, it’s just one guy. He comes from a city that’s really close to where I live. He started in the music industry close to 10 years ago. He’s only a year older than me and he’s really talented, he’s got a nice voice. His music “soothes the soul”. Very relaxing."

176129589,On their site they give a warning for anyone with serious mental illness to not partake in the floatation tank experience. It’s sensory deprivation. I’ve heard it can help but I’ve also heard it can be extremely harmful. Anyone have any input? I’m afraid to go now because I’m not stable BUT when I reach that point where I’m ok I want to try it. BUT I’m worried it won’t be a good idea—I don’t need to have an episode.

174375014,So you believe you have schizophrenia and not schizoaffective right?
176129599,_AT_MENTION_…how was homeschooling comapred to the classroom…did you do it because you were a victim of bullying…i should have done it myslef as school bullies screwed me over

176129606,_AT_MENTION_ posted posted an article that says its the skull and other tissues surrounding the brain that can feel pain but not the brain. I cant remember the article though. Maybe blood vessels can feel pain? Not sure.

176129608,not go mad
176129609,I was on 234mg monthly injections. To get me off of it my dr added another AP and as he lowered the paliperidone he upped the other AP. I had no withdrawal symptoms.
176129610,For psych meds I take: Celexa 20 mg Benztropine 3 mg Haldol 10 mg I’m ok with them. I just wish the men would leave me alone and I wish others wouldn’t report on me to them. Meds don’t stop that because it’s really happening. But I am less religious and weird with meds

176129616,yea i wonder same… for me it seems to be getting worse with negative symptoms and paranoia but most positive symptoms seem to get better as long as i’m on my meds… i don’t know how i would be without my meds but last time i tried to taper off i ended up in psych ward again so i don’t think that gets better.

It’s not prevalence of the population of mentally ill people. That would be overcomplicated and less informative, and the vast majority of prevalence studies are on the general population. Multiple comorbidities (more than 2 diagnoses) are common, and that probably explains why you don’t get the numbers to make sense. Also, the numbers could be too large due to methodological issues.

174375047,"I came across some articles that talk about auditory pareidolia, when noise is misinterpreted into speech. I think this is what I have because whenever there is certain background noise like the jets on in my hot tub, I hear voices that seem like they are coming from the sound. Plus I feel mentally well and I don’t have any delusions except I used to think the voices were real people. The following is from http://nautil.us/blog/why-we-hear-voices-in-random-noise Commenters detail their experiences, often believing they are symptomatic of mental illness. For example, one commenter writes: “I thought I was going crazy. When my air conditioner is on, I wake up and hear light conversations. I would go to the window to see if anyone was outside, or I would turn the air conditioner off [and] it would stop. Sometimes it sounds like a radio.” Another, more at-ease commenter writes about her similar experience of hearing voices from the sound of central air control: “I would hear faint voices—whis
pering, conversing, singing, or chanting! It sounded like a crowded room, full of people at a party in a distant room somewhere in the building. After a while I came to enjoy the sound, as they seemed to be enjoying themselves at the ‘party,’ and it helped lull me to sleep at night.” These examples of auditory pareidolia might make you wonder what the sonic characteristics of natural speech are, and moreover, how the sound of an air conditioner—or any other noise-making object—could possibly resemble speech. At one point scientists were generally in agreement that the waveform characteristics essential for perceiving speech sounds were largely understood. That changed when a single study showed that speech could be perceived in sounds that did not contain any of these acoustic properties. end of copy and paste Also, voice hearers are more capable of understanding sine wave speech in which speech is converted into sine waves and most normal people can’t detect speech from it. I listened to some sin
e wave speech and I could understand some of the words in it. You can read more about this at https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/12/mentally-well-voice-hearers-have-a-heightened-ability-to-detect-real-speech/ The only thing that makes me think it could be sz is that I do have negative symptoms but these could actually just be bad habits or side effects of my invega sustenna injection.

Going down the rabbit hole now however causes all kinds of confusion. One thought leads to another and before you know I’m lost in a sea of self destructive behavior. Lately I’ve been doing a ton of research into all kinds of fringy stuff and I feel like I’m losing grip on reality. I try to share it with people I trust and people i think can handle it. My cousin just laughs and my brother mostly ignores it, he says that sometimes ignorance is bliss… and sometimes i think he is right! I believe information is powerful but can be difficult to.process given our condition. Try not to get to caught up in it and take breaks. The world is not all bad, keep your head up and keep moving forward."

176129748,"Lot of games, lot of psychological stuff. I already figured out a year or more ago that the crazy old hag next door wants to destroy me. But my brain is failing me. I always had a strong mind. I survived two solid years of psychosis pretty much intact, my mind survived 4 years of crack addiction and came out fine, and then I carved a little respect out of some people for giving back a little of the crap that was thrown at me. But I think the problem is I tried too hard. After years of being the scapegoat and people assuming I won’t fight back I scared some soldiers who really deserved it and the maniacs who drive California freeways. But I got carried away and now my brain is prematurely tired and if it wasn’t, I could be handling the craziness my neighbors sometimes dish out way better. Yeah, I overextended myself. Right now it’s quiet, I really enjoy my apartment when no ones bugging me."

174375050,"I have been trying to get off Saphriis for a while now- you may have heard me mention it- and I am drawing the process out. My pdoc knows this, but I doubt she knows why I’m going so slowly. The truth is, it’s like a drug for me. When I had problems abusing prescription pills, I did it because they allowed me to sleep my pain and troubles away. Saphris is liike that in that it puts me to sleep. If I get off Saphris, I don’t have that any more, so a big part of me doesn’t want to get off of it. Even the lower dose that I’m not on knocks me out. I don’t know what to do with myself when I’m awake unless I have special plans (i.e. grocery shopping, going to the movies), in which case I have to either skip my morning pills or drink TWO Monster energy drinks, which agitates my TD severely. So it’s pretty much a drug to me. I am scared to get off of it, and I’m equally scared to stay on it. Right now, I am taking 5 mg/morning and 10mg/night. I asked my pdoc if I should move to 5mg/night 
now or if I should cut out the daytime pill and just do the 10mg. I’ll see what she says tomorrow. In the meantime, I’m really stressed. I feel like I am getting off of my med abuse all over again, but this time, I was allowed to sleep the world away. And, for the record, 5mg makes me sleep just as much as 10mg. Does anyone have any advice for me? I know it needs to stop; I really do want to live life again. However, I feel like I don’t know how because it’s been so long. I’m not having withdrawals, just fears. I would love some ideas. _AT_MENTION_ I know you had problems with drugs. How did you start living again? Anyone else? Thanks in advance."

A light had to go off in my brain sooner or later. And, no more trying to find someone online, I’m going to start approaching them in the community.As long as I don’t have to do it too much before I get a “yes”.

176129766,Oh also a tip that helps me when hunger pangs are overwhelming is to eat ice. It gives the sensation of eating something while also being 0 calories and thus not breaking the fast. For me interestingly after eating a small bowl of ice my hunger temporarily goes away.

Waiting for more generics to come out and be approved by the medical aid.imi might try the risperidone constsa when it comes out in generic as heard better than the tablet form.

174375074,Yes I have the bipolar aspect. I went for rtms for the depressive/negative symptoms whatever ya want to call them. Not sadness or anything just lack motivation and avolition.

176129868,I remember the golden days when flying was gawdamn expensive even for short flights and they treated you like kings and queens. Full meals on an hour flight. Now you get trail mix if your lucky! I’ve done the hard yards too though. Getting out of America was like flying 21 hours in the air over one and a half days in economy. I was devastated when I arrived in Brisbane. Funny as. I got questioned by a customs dude waiting for my baggage and I went through all the bulldust but just said I wanted to go home. I was in a poor state after that trip and got a clean bill through customs! I for one love flying and I love airports still!

176129893,"By splendor I of course mean my truth. TRIGGER WARNING for the entire post. *Disclaimer: Im pretty stable right now these are mostly thoughts and experiences. I have been lying to everyone in my life about how good I’m doing. The most honest I am is on here, but thats only because I’m more or less anonymous. I lie to everyone in my day to day life. My second biggest fear right now is losing freedom. Not in a patriotic sense, but more in the day to day living sense. I dont want to be locked in a hospital for the way I think, and I’m scared if I’m honest with everyone it will happen. My first biggest fear is something bad happening to my loved ones. This is important, as much of what I do is influenced by this fear. The truth: I am told that if I dont immediately buy something then they will come and hurt my family. It happens when _PERSON_ at the store, online, playing video games, or even at a restaurant. Sometimes it’s the most random items, and sometimes it’s a wee bit more expensive. 
I tell people I’m just bad with money so they don’t know that I’m freaking terrified they will come and hurt my pets, friends, or family. I want to hand over my funds to my mom, and I’ve been hinting that I need help. Im just scared to commit because of that nagging fear. The few people I’ve told this too always ask the same question: who are they?They are them and them are they. People don’t understand that. They are them and them are they. Thats all I know. I dont know if its a group or cult or whatever, but they are them. I have a lot of insight right now, so I know they don’t exist, and if they don’t exist then them can’t exist either. One cant be without the other. I dont tell people that when _PERSON_ having an episode I turn mind into a labyrinth so its harder to broadcast my thoughts. It makes me feel safe, and I have guardians that protect my thoughts. Too be honest I think this is definitely more of my imagination and defense mechanism than it is a delusion. I know that the labyrin
th only exists in my mind. Ive always had a big imagination and I think the idea of turning my mind into a labyrinth came about from the movie the Labyrinth with _NAME_. I used to practice mazes and labyrinths to get ideas. I mean, this is where my fear comes in. To me that seems like a harmless practice, and I think its a good coping skill too be honest. It makes me feel safe and secure. I am terrified that if I tell anybody that I create a mental labyrinth with different beasts guarding it then they will send me to the hospital. I won’t see my pets and my family may forget about me. Im a big supporter of going to the hospital to get stable, so why am I so scared of going back? Its done nothing but good for me, but I hate hate hate not being able to do things I want to do. Well to make a long story longer, the reason why I made this thread is that now I’m obsessing on an idea that if I dont come clean and be completely transparent with my treatment team and family then something bad will happen to my lov
ed ones. I’d do anything to protect them, even if it means being forgotten in a hospital."

I gain a lot of clarity when I sit. I also can realize when the thinking is not working. I will still be looking for other ways to spend my time. We have all been through this topic many times.

176129956,"Cool post. Power (or control) is one of the concepts that have been front and center during my psychoses. I once wrote a blog post on the concept that describes my beliefs around the idea. Here it is: BLOG POST (POWER): I believe that power is one of the most fundamental elements of human social interaction. Wikipedia describes power (in context of social science and politics) as the capacity of an individual to influence the behaviour (or conduct) of others. It goes on to describe the five bases of power: Legitimate Power: Authority that has been delegated to another by someone else in power. As visible in corporate world within the relationship between bosses and their subordinates. Referent Power: That from within. Where the individual in power has key traits that are attractive to those following. Such as charisma, interpersonal skills and a high EQ. Expert Power: That which derives from an individual’s skills or expertise in one or more areas. It can be used to rationalise their opinions so 
that the person following understands that it only makes sense to follow their direction. Reward Power: Where the individual exercising power does so by promising (and ideally delivering on) valued rewards in exchange for another’s obedience. Coercive Power: Where negative elements are used to influence another. Ultimately culminating in fear within the person being influenced — and this motivating them to abide by the direction of the person exerting this type of power. I believe that the relative nature of power is best observed when analysing the interactions between leaders and followers. Leaders specify direction and constraints to their followers and the followers execute upon the direction of the person leading them, potentially (and in turn) providing direction to others — in order to influence their behaviour. Unfortunately, power has had a bad rap ever since _PERSON_ published The Prince, and even more-so with recent publications like 48 Laws of Power by _NAME_. Where power is represented as a 
tool for manipulation of others, often by coercive means. But such circumstances are not the only occasions where power becomes visible. I believe that power (often in more subtle form) takes place in almost every social interaction between two or more people. Some examples of this more subtle demonstration of power include: Partner Dancing: There is often a leader and a follower. The leader is demonstrating power and the follower is following their lead. And in some routines the power state may flip back and forth, as the roles of leader and follower swap in either gradual or quick succession. Improv: Within improv it is taught that to keep the flow of an act moving forward, each individual in the act should get a chance to be in the spotlight. With each individual in the spotlight (after performing their piece), creating an opening and passing power to the next person so that they can have a chance to be in the spotlight. With this continuing on throughout the act. Banter: Where two people get in to a rhyth
m (possibly even a flow state) — throwing trivial (and often comedic) statements back and forth to one another, with each having some relation to the last. This being another representation of rapidly flipping power states. Conversation: And conversation more generally also follows this pattern. Where one person may lead the conversation for a period of time, before transferring the lead to another who may after some time transfer the lead back to the original person or another individual (in group settings like meetings). If one person dominates a conversation (holding the power throughout) then such a conversation tends to die pretty quickly. I also believe that power does not always require conscious effort on the part of the beholder, and may or not be recognised by those following. Awareness of course plays a critical role here. And trust as well — such as where those following have such trust in the person leading that they believe every word that they are saying is gospel. Or where the influence im
parted by the individual in power is so subtle (a nudge) that the person or people following believe that they themselves came up with the idea. And from the perspective of the individual in power — they might be so used to others following their lead that they are not aware of the influential effect of what they are saying or doing. Another interesting point to ponder is whether power can be given or must be taken. I believe that both constructs are possible. Power can be given as long as the other person is willing to accept and exercise it. And power can be taken (in most circumstances) as long as the person holding it is willing to let it go (if only temporarily). Of course — the person who originally held the power does not always need to be willing to let it go — something that is evident in war (where power is taken by force) or through the person taking it damaging the reputation of the person who initially wielded it. Although — such “power grabs” may not always succeed and have the poten
tial to cause great damage to the reputation of the person grabbing the power if unsuccessful. Not to mention the moral implications of such an act. In summary — I believe that power is present in almost every social human interaction in some way, shape or form. And through being aware of it and understanding it we can ensure more fruitful relationships with one another — with relationships being key to human social interaction."
176129957,"I did the second quiz and got a hundred percent. My answers were corrected by a computer. I’m learning a lot though and am happy. I signed up for another free course too. I like free courses. However, they are difficult. I am using these courses as a barometer of my future performance in grad school. I am motivated to learn still. I have many deficits in my education. I dropped out of high school when I was a teenager but studied for the GED then went to community college. I am a life-long student now. I love learning. My brother went to high school and college. He brags that he received a good education. But, he does not study now. He thinks about taking the easy way out. I am self-taught mostly - developed my own way of studying. Some people think education is only academic; it is not. I learned more about life from my experiences than going to school. I’m a better student since I learned from books and on my own. I developed my style of test-taking too. I perform well on multiple-choice exam
s. But, I want to write well, not just be a proficient text-taker. My brother says writing well reveals how one thinks. If you can’t think clearly, your writing will reflect this. I agree. My mind is obfuscated by voices at times. I can’t think- let alone think clearly. I want to write logically and effectively. I have to be patient and practice a lot. My brother thinks I’m wasting my time writing. He thinks A.I. will be used to write papers and articles. Translation software uses A.I. I don’t like translating papers and articles. But, the software can do this to some extent. I talked to one of my students who went to America. She can not understand what people are saying but is using a software app to translate and interpret for her. The app works! Who needs interpreters/ translators when a software app can do these tasks? May be, I’m wasting my time learning how to write. I have science and medical degrees. I have not been able to use them for jobs yet. I’m hoping to reverse this. I became sick 
while doing these degrees. I was too sick before to work. Now, I can work but not at a demanding job. So, I want to write for a living. Writing is hard too if done well. I know of people who write fiction. They love writing. They write all kinds of essays, stories, and books. I admire them. I wish I had their creativity. All I have are motivation and discipline. So, we shall see."

176129973,"I weight lift 4-5 times a week and eat relatively healthy, but it’s not enough. This year I have gained a good 20 pounds of fat due to medication issues (What I think is due to elevated prolactin levels in particular) I want my six pack back. I will incorporate some form of cardio on top of my workouts. I also think that as my prolactin levels are almost normal levels now, the weight will start to come off easier as well. I was thinking of adding 2 hour walks on the treadmill 5 times a week split in 2x 1 hourly sessions a day on top of my current workouts. I could do this while watching TV."

176130000,So is uranium. What a statement.
176130001,Today I established some limits to an agreement I previously had with a person. It´s good because it´s mutually beneficial. Feeling proud of myself.
174375103,"I went out tonight to run an errand, anything to get out of the house. I ended up at CVS pharmacy and my big purchase ended up being a bottle of Dr. Pepper. On the drive home it was a nice night but my problems with neighbors and work and other things kept butting into my mind even though I tried not to think of them. But then something triggered a bad memory of my drug addiction back in the late '80’s. It just flashed on me about the era when I was doing cocaine, smoking crack and drinking. And the time my dealer stole my car and wouldn’t give it back. He was basically holding it hostage until I gave him some crack. But to backtrack, he didn’t just come right out and tell me he had it. He told me some other guys had it but he can get it from them. Anyway, his whole story was ambiguous and he kept changing things. I was going crazy because it wasn’t even really my car, it was my dads and he had lent it to me, and my dad was not rich so if someone stole his car it would be difficult to repla
ce it. After a dozen phone calls back and forth between my dealer and me and just a pack of lies from him he finally said he could get my car for me for $60.00 but I would have to go on the bus to get there and it was about 8 miles away. But I had no job and I was broke so I went house to house up and down my street in my neighborhood and knocked on doors and if someone answered I had made up some lie about how I had to pay someone so they wouldn’t tow my car. A small part of me thought this was cool but it mainly wasn’t and I promised people I would pay them back. At that time in my life, I was addicted to crack, I was unemployed, I was having a relapse of my schizophrenia, I was always stressed, tired, hungry and my life was out of control. I lived in supported housing but I still saw my family but they all suspected I was on drugs because of the stupid things I was doing like going door to door asking strangers for money. But I went up and down three streets to almost every house and I actually got abo
ut $60.00! Only one guy got mad at me and wanted to beat me up. I didn’t intend to tell this story so long, I just wanted to paint a picture of what a life as an addict was like for me. It was just bad experience after bad experience. I was hooked and right smack dab in the middle of an addicts life. And this incident and a hundred more almost as bad or worse were just how my day to day life unfolded. The most effed up situations, being jerked around and the bull I went through to get my drugs. The run-ins with police, going to the city where I got my drugs at any time of night, walking long distances for nothing, making 5 or 6 trips to the ATM in one night was typical; taking out $20.00 at a time, bouncing checks, borrowing money etc. My life now is nothing like that. And I was in my car tonight feeling grateful. My life now is cked up in many, many ways. Right now I’m doing OK with money but my personal life, is on the rocks and often I feel like I’m going downhill. I feel like I am losing what I stri
ved for decades and now that I finally accomplished it, it’s being taken away, partly because it’s my fault and partly being taken away by sadistic, low life neighbors. I I am good at solving problems but on a typical day, I often write here, that good stuff still happens to me now matter how bad my life gets. And it’s true. One of you guys was joking on here about how I always talk about getting a smile from a woman and how happy it makes me. Well, to be honest, sometimes I would like a lot more . But just a smile is nice enough. IDK. These are the best of times, these are the worst of times. I don’t know how my life will play out, I may lose everything in an ugly, uncool, lame way or maybe somehow things will work out alright and I’ll be cool and happy. Just an epilogue to my car story: I got the $60.00, I made the hour long bus trip to get my car. I arrived, gave my dealer the money and was told that some other guy had the keys to start it. I walked 4 blocks to meet the guy, ended up in a library 
somehow, had an acute episode and ended up that day in the psyche ward. I eventually got out and got my car and picked up where I left off and smoked crack and lived my messed up life. And people wonder why I say don’t do drugs?"

174375116,"It most certainly does. Clozaril can make you feel a lot less depressed and helps you think better thoughts about yourself. Helps bring you into reality more than any other drug usually. On clozaril, I found myself enjoying the simpler things much more. For example I enjoyed late night drives while listening to an AM radio station featuring various comedians. I also read a lot more on clozaril. Overall that drug basically cured me while I was on it. A+ drug, could not recommend more."

176130046,"Hi I also see many similar things with my physical eyes among other things: I didn’t know about tactile hallucinations until it all started as if the veil dropped and now I feel like I live in two planes of existence. Typically beyond the veil side is really dark and unfortunate. The bugs and rotting food part stopped when I was tired of it and just said f#ck it and picked up a big demonic grub looking thing and ate it. I was being a bit a bit of a diva about it also lol. Point is you are not alone on the level you can experience things. I tell my lady about maybe 20 percent of what I experience. Reason being is that I’ve been learning allot about reality, super natural, sub conscious and it’s effects and little triggers that bring on different things / hallucinations etc. One extreme was when the house was shaking nonstop violently at the dinner table with roomies and little meteorites were crashing thru the ceiling everywhere. That was a more complicated one to play off! I try not to share 
what’s not being shared already as I don’t want to plant the seeds of possibility in others sub conscious just Incase. Also in no way is that meant as judgment for others sharing what they want. I’m just hyper critical and over sensitive of my actions and effect on others admittedly. Hard thing for me is … and I Don’t mean to blurr any lines between perceived reality and not . It is just that my whole life I’ve had allot of psychic ability and experiences …even knowing detailed things about people and their families and influences etc to detail that shocks those. I tell about what I perceive. It’s hard to know where to draw the lines and I hope saying that is ok because I feel like I’m breaking my own rule out of my need to relate with someone."

176130048,Yes. He comes on and takes care of things.
176130049,"It drains me too irl. Because I have so many negative thoughts going through my head subconsciously and consciously, about myself, when I talk to people irl. Those negative thinking patterns is what drain me. It is really depressing. I think self care is the solution but it will take a long time like maybe 5 years or less to get a basic significant change. And then from then on it should be more smooth. If all goes to plan."
176130050,"Back when I was about 25 years old and addicted to crack I was sharing a house with three other guys. I spent all my money on crack and had no food. My roommate felt sorry for me and he gave me his debit card and his pin and told me I could go to his bank and withdraw $75.00 for food and then come back. I got his debit card but I withdrew $200 and went to get drugs and met a hooker and her boyfriend and we got some coke and heroin and shot up and we hung out in their motel room and had a few adventures. I didn’t come back for three days and when I finally wandered in, broke, dirty and burned out my friend was furious and he told me called the police in three neighboring cities to look for me and he sat in the living room with his gun waiting for me to walk in the door so he could shoot me. But he got tired and went to bed. I mean, who gives a known crack addict their debit card and their pin? Sheesh, he should have known something like that was going to happen."
176130051,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo
u’re just daydreaming to observers."

174375123,Forgot to add. I still hear voices at times. It’s no where near as bad as before. I prefer the abilify over the haldol. The voices went from incredibly aggressive and commanding they are now more soft and I guess wimpy ( couldn’t think of a better word)
176130056,"No one should exceed the optimum/maximum dose of the drug. One should start with the lowest dose and gradually increase, if necessary, and stop at the effective dose. The aim is to reach the “lowest effective dose”."
176130057,"Like these people have been telling you, there are a lot of different medications, and the med’s affect various people differently. A drug that might put one person flat on his/her back won’t do anything to another person. I’ve been having good luck with Geodon. A lot of people swear by that drug, but if Geodon doesn’t work you can always try another. About the best outcome is for the drug to control or eliminate your symptoms with few debilitating side effects."

174375128,"It’s not gibberish. It really does have meaning. I feel separated from my body and thoughts right now, like all my mind’s functions are severed and scattered. There are spirits all around me! Who is to say that I am schizophrenic? Were there every any tests with biological validity done? No. Just countless interviews from countless doctors who determined that my perception of reality, my ways of thinking, and my behavior did not fit in with the oppressive institutional CONSENSUS REALITY (Copyright by McDonald’s mind-ray arches). I am not schizophrenic. Who is to say that I CANNOT talk to spirits? WHO is to say that these spirits are not real? Who is to say my “symptoms” were not caused by SPIRITUAL CRISIS/sublime connection OR DEMONIC POSSESSION? Nobody can say that for sure. I’m going to go back to doing Rorschach tests."

174375129,"I accept it too. It doesn’t bother me, I’m used to it and I just do it naturally but in 39 years only one person could tell and he was a fellow schizophrenic and addict. We both went to AA and I knew the guy for years though we weren’t close. He was a funny guy who had been in prison and he announced at most meetings that he had paranoid schizophrenia and he would make light of it and joke around about it and make everybody laugh. He was huge. He was about 6’ 5"" and probably around 250 lbs. He knew I was schizophrenic somehow but it was no big deal but one night at a CA meeting he said to me, “You think people can hear your thoughts.” It freaked me out. I was in my thirties at the time and I had been diagnosed at age 19 but I never had consciously realized that I suffered from that. I had heard of thought broadcasting but I never realized that I did it until he mentioned it. But life went on and nothing changed and I still have it but it really doesn’t distress me or get in the way o
f anything."

176130069,"So tired of not having an income. But I’m not the only one who fell through the cracks. Covid19 has shed a huge spotlight on already rampant issues in the US. From police brutality to the voiceless finding a voice. I believe UBI is the only thing that will save the US from a second Great Depression. You wanna work? Great. But UBI would end the welfare class gap, give opportunities to those left out, prevent crime/homelessness/addiction/mental illness/suicide and solve them before its too late. I propose $10,000 a month to all but something like that at least should get the ball rolling because it’s about freedom to all not the top not the bottom, we gotta bridge the gap between the two. If people can’t let go of their freaking power holds we’re all gonna start hurting a heck of a lot more. UBI will save the USA. If I had it I would buy a car, finish my certificate and start working a heck of a lot sooner than waiting for this trickle down economy to work for me. And honestly it’s not work
ing at all for anyone. Maybe just a few people."

174375126,"I am very somatic in my illness too and it was painful till hell, yeap… I have a permanent, very strong anxiety and paranoia too 24/7… But i’ve always looked more depressed to others than schizophrenic… But in my case, the docs say its not only my depression… Tbh i dont think you are schizophrenic… The somatization is more common in depression, anxiety etc yeap… Dont worry, stick with your docs and talk to them about what concerns you And those meds are often prescribed to people with lighter disorders. The best friend of my mom, which is not sz at all, had anxiety and depression and she was prescribed zyprexa and got better in 2 months. The meds help many things, yeap. Take care, hugs!"

174375142,I find talking therapy with the psychologist to be tiresome and pointless. I ended up with another label to add to my Schizophrenia because of it as well. It’s up to you how much you want to engage in this kind of thing. I am just trying to see if it has any benefits but I am yet to see any
176130087,I took 2 x 200mg

176130093,"I’ve lived in poverty and I’ve lived in relative riches. I was unhappy in poverty not because of the lack of money, but because my husband was abusive. Now, I live in unquestioned abundance and I’m happy. Not because of the money, but because my wife loves me and we adore each other and treat each other good."

176130097,Good job on catching yourself. At least you tried.
176130098,I’m intrigued! Great start keep it coming!
174375141,Or it meant you were getting a hole drilled in your skull to “release the demons” Many mental illnesses have gotten worse with the pressures of society and the diminishing of community support. But schizophrenia always was debilitating.
176130099,"if you’re not wanting to get anymore schooling im not really sure. sometimes trades will pay for your schooling while you apprentice. I have a couple friends who became union electricians and their schooling was paid for. they make good money for this part of the country, I thought about becoming an electrician but didn’t want to have to get up on ladders. im having a hard time deciding what to do myself. one thing im considering is librarian. my local community college has a library sciences degree that would require some schooling, but could maybe help me land a low stress quiet job. another one I thought of that I can see you being good at, is an addictions recovery/ counselor. would require a bit of schooling but here you can get a 2 year degree from a community college and save a lot of money. you seem to have some experience with this and it would probably help you stay on the straight and narrow. then you could make your music as a side gig and who knows, maybe some day you’ll blow up.

I stopped because they’re so desperate they try all sorts of non med things and are just, I don’t know, seem crazier than us. I know it’s because they’re desperate but it was too much for me. They need better and stricter moderation. Like a free for all over there."

176130130,No unfortunately. Good idea though.
176130131,"I question about putting headphones over my ears. Like being a person who puts things over their ears when they speak to you. “I can’t hear what you are saying! But this is what I have to say!” Sometimes I refer to myself as, ‘Princess _USER_ID_’. But when I am alone I don’t see a difference if no one is talking to me. But even sometimes when I wear headphones and I am alone I question it. But I had a young kid ask me for headphones for Christmas, so I know that kids these days are doing it. It comes down to ‘putting things over my ears’ in general. But I think it’s a good point if someone has something over their ears when they are talking to you. But when I am alone I could get paranoid enough about it that it would cause me symptoms like voices. And I question wearing headphones and I almost think that walking around with decent speakers is a better option. I can somewhat relate to what you are going through."

We’ve been married for five years, and they have been hard. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective two years in. We have two toddlers together. I won’t take all of the blame (I have for five years but am learning not to), but we are now out of money. Five hospitalizations later. Four years of private pay therapy and psychiatry. Weekly counseling. Intensive outpatient twice a week. Wreaks havoc on the schedule and the bank account. My husband is apathetic. Both of our choices drove him to this point. He is not fulfilling orders at work. He is not returning phone calls. He refuses to develop a resume. After conversations with my family doctor and psychiatrist, I applied for disability back in December. I haven’t heard anything, and they said it takes months to years to be approved and then receive it. But we have no money now. They don’t w
ant me to work, but what are we supposed to do in the meantime? If I go to work and we find that I’m not able to (because I have an episode or from cognitive impairment from the medication), I lose out on disability. It’s all so hard, and I feel trapped."

176130145,"Adrenochrome may be the cause for the thought broadcasting etc. I’m going to try vitamin c and niacin megadose to lower it. en.m.wikipedia.org Adrenochrome Adrenochrome is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO3 produced by the oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). The derivative carbazochrome is a hemostatic medication. Despite a similarity in chemical names, it is unrelated to chrome or chromium. In vivo, adrenochrome is synthesized by the oxidation of epinephrine. In vitro, silver oxide (Ag2O) is used as an oxidizing agent. Its presence is detected in solution by a pink color. The color turns brown upon polymerization. Sever... Several small-scale studies (involving 15 or fewer test subjects) conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder, derealization, and euphoria.[2] Researchers _NAME_ and _PERSON_ claimed that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and may play a role in schizophrenia and 
other mental illnesses.[3] In what they called the “adrenochrome hypothesis”,[4] they speculated that megadoses of vitamin C and niacin could cure schizophrenia by reducing brain adrenochrome.[5][6] While the treatment of schizophrenia with such potent anti-oxidants is highly contested in literature, and adrenochrome is not currently believed to have any psychedelic properties,[7] a number of recently published papers consider _PERSON_’s paper a landmark contribution to the notion that impairment of what’s now termed the anti-oxidant defense system (AODS) seems to play a role in schizophrenia.[8]"

You say you’ve been diagnosed with autism? Okay, then you have autism. And even if you don’t have autism, we have absolutely no way of finding that out short of you confessing. I’d even go as far to say that, if you did confess to lying about having autism, there’d probably be one thread where it was discussed, and then we’d all move on, because it really doesn’t matter, at least not to me. The main things that we care about are whether or not you’re taking your meds, where your symptoms lie on a scale of “nonexistent” to “all-consuming,” whether you are safe, stuff like that.

The meds aren’t stopping people from hearing your thoughts, they’re stopping you from feeling and believing that such a thing is even possible.

174375159,"It always seemed like it was though. I think multiple schizophrenic reasons for it though. For one, when I made little sense in the things which I said the world seemed hostile in their confused response. But the world was trying to help me for the most part. I guess what I’m saying, is I think through better mental health, I have “earned” the right to be treated with respect. In forward, the world is not out to get me. By making sense of things more, becoming a functional member of a society and increasingly so it is a self fulfilling prophecy where the world is NOT out to get me. When I was really fd up, my perception was the world was out to get me. And they probably were too. Because I was incomprehensible. But now with improved mental clarity I have earned much of societies respect. So it’s a double edge sword into why the world is not out to get me. I have almost always been mentally ill. I think my whole life I’ve been a bit off and then trauma and substances exasperated the stuff.

Now the voice said they’re not allowed to tell me why they’re doing it, but before I’ve been told it’s to tell me what’s going to happen to me after death, so I would try to escape this schizophrenia The pleasant taste has been turned off again; food is no longer tasty Controlled dreams continue It has made me again (2 times recently) feel fake will. First time was in a dream, “I” wanted to sit up, but couldn’t - it felt like I wanted it, but probably it was fake will (my schizophrenia can duplicate the feeling of moving my body willfully). After waking up the voice said “You just fought with yourself” (it was a hint of me torturing myself after 
death), and then inserted thoughts came saying it will “count” after death, when I’m going to be tortured. 2nd time was just after waking from a dream, it was a fake sleep paralysis - it felt like I wanted to move, but couldn’t, and “I” was making sounds with my mouth. Again it was apparently a fake feeling of will. It can make me feel like I’m doing or wanting to do different things, while actually I don’t. Very often it makes me feel fake urge to pee (different from the real feeling). I’m being told it damages me (after death) if I follow that urge, but the “spirit” that controls my body goes to the bathroom anyway and there is nothing I can do. I’m told that each time is “written” into my soul, and will “count” after death. Bad feelings continue, usually they are worse at night. Sometimes it inflicts an unbearable feeling on my left foot, which partially goes away when my leg moves, and comes back a bit after it stops moving; it can continue for a while. The feelings also go 
away when doing certain things, like checking this forum for new posts. There’s more going on, but these ones, I’ve been told, have a reason behind them."
176130198,"Years ago in the late eighties I was relapsing. After about 5 years of being stable I figured I would never be hospitalized again. But there I was again going in and out of hospitals. At our county hospital we had a psyche ward but before you could get in you had to be evaluated in a separate, special room which could fit about 8 or 9 patients and some desks for about three or four staff. So basically there was a TV and some chairs and couches and the staff tried to get you in and evaluated, and then get you out as soon as possible. But the wait could take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. I was in this place three or four times. But one time I was in with this really tough looking Mexican lady. She looked like she was into some hardcore stuff, maybe drugs, violence, maybe jail. I was about 28 and she looked to be about 30. She was kind of good looking in a hard kind of way and she was wearing tight jeans and man, she filled out those jeans mighty fine. I kept checking her out and I th
ought I was being subtle and sneaky and I couldn’t help but keep glancing at her. But then all of a sudden she turned to be and said, “If you don’t stop looking at me I’m going to punch you in your fat nose.” I can laugh about it now but at the time she actually scared me and embarrassed me which was even worse. Yeah, it was funny, I’ll never forget that, lol."

174375176,"Learning theorists have no business judging the way people living with schizophrenia act, and shouldn?t be compared to the way someone learns in school and the ?good student?? Half the time schizophrenia is out of our control and the way we think sometimes is just like inserted in our brain, I highly doubt others are adapting to how to be sz in a hospital setting. That sounds bizzarre, everyone has their own brain and can think for themselves. And sz isn?t even a behavior it?s a chemical Imbalance that causes life to be disrupted and you are lucky if you have insight then you can report things to professionals and try to live the most normal life"

174375174,Negative symptoms can cause a great impact on your quality of life. Reasons I think I’m on disability. They should at the very least inform you that you may very well suffer from these.

Time advances very slowly with a mental illness implying psychosis, although it is frequently called, with a horrible connotation Schizophrenia. Thinking of the crowds, like at picnics, weddings, funerals, sporting events, or other feats of delusional imagining, that they are all like a herd, or all have some sort of group identity reveals then that the world contains inequalities.

C _PERSON_, V _PERSON_, _PERSON_, PP _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Clinical neuropharmacology , Apr 30 2019 Introduction of old and new generations of antipsychotics leads to significant improvements in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms remain refractory to conventional trials of antipsychotic therapy. Recently, there were several open clinical human trials with curcumin. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol, which has a variety of pharmacological activities, including antioxidative and neuroprotective effects. The studies showed that curcumin improved the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of our study was to examine the efficacy of curcumin as an add-on agent to regular antipsychotic medications in patients with chronic schizophrenia.Thirty-eight patients with chro
nic schizophrenia were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The subjects were treated with either 3000 mg/d curcumin or placebo combined with antipsychotics from January 2015 to February 2017. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia.Analysis of variance showed significant positive changes in both groups from baseline to the end of the study in all scales of measurement. There was a significant response to curcumin within 6 months in total PANSS (P = 0.02) and in the negative symptoms subscale (P = 0.04). There were no differences in the positive and general PANSS subscales, and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia scores between the treatment and placebo groups. No patient complained of any adverse effect.The promising results of curcumin as an add-on to antipsychotics in the treatment of negative symptoms may open a new and safe therapeutic option for the management of schizop

But he mentioned that maybe these are spirits, and that I’ve managed to “pierce the veil.” This has alarmed me as I have had religious symptoms in the past, such as seeing angels and demons among other things.

My day job comes with a very high cognitive load so I can’t work with a heavy AP that shuts down my higher brain function on me. I don’t feel a need to stay in touch with my positive symptoms because they’re all BS leaking from an ill mind. I ignore them with gusto and have developed powerful habits that help me in this department now. I highly recommend CBT and therapy in addition to meds.

174375191,"Highlights • Three distinct cognitive subgroups exist within SSD. • A subgroup characterised by relatively intact cognitive functioning. • An intermediate subgroup characterised by moderate/mixed levels of impairment. • A globally impaired subgroup characterised by severe cognitive dysfunction. Abstract The aim of the present review was to systematically summarise our current understanding of the structure of the cognitive heterogeneity that exists within schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Fifty-two relevant studies were identified from January 1980 to March 2019 that investigated cognitive subgroups within SSD. Twenty-five studies employed classification criteria based on current neuropsychological function, 14 studies employed various data-driven subgrouping methodologies and 13 studies investigated putative cognitive symptom trajectories. Despite considerable methodological variability, three distinct cognitive subgroups reliability emerged; a relatively intact cognitive subgroup cha
racterised by high cognitive performance, an intermediate cognitive subgroup defined by mixed or moderate levels of cognitive function/dysfunction and a globally impaired subgroup characterised by severe cognitive deficits. Whilst preliminary evidence suggests that these subgroups may have further investigative relevance in and of themselves, additional research is required and discussed. A set of reporting guidelines are also presented to overcome the methodological inconsistencies identified in the reviewed literature.

Additionally, effects on weight, lipids, glycemic indices, prolactin and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) measures were negligible and not clinically meaningful. The proportion of patients who experienced EPS during the 26 weeks of treatment with SEP-363856 was 3.2 percent. he study also showed that patients treated with SEP-363856 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements across all efficacy measures, including the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (-22.6), the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S) score (-1.0), and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) total score (-11.3).

At first i thought it was a medical issue, but all tests came back normal. As time went on I started to feel worse. I feel nervous a lot, have trouble concentrating at times, and occasionally a depressed feeling mood. When I’m outside sometimes I see small colored spots in my vision. I don’t hallucinate through the day though. At night I’m having vivid dreams and hearing voices that wake me up. When I close my eyes sometimes I’ll see scenery or people. I did hear about hypnagogic hallucinations, but it’s getting more frequent. I’ve wrote on here before. It’s just the past few days I’ve been feeling worse. I have that feeling something seems different. I’ve been keeping busy with hobbies, excerising, household chores, etc. That definitely helps me cope better when I’m struggling. Another concern is where to find h
elp for something like this. I’ve never had an experience like this before."

But I feel like I’m gonna make close to 30k In A 12 month period with ssdi+part time job if all goes the same. And I get Medicare. And other benefits of being disabled.

Something which is hidden maybe from me and that’s why I don’t get better? I am not sure if you understand… But I probably really went in the iq deficits and too much living in my head so I don’t understand the reality… For god sake, reality is not dangerous!!! Nothing cant happen to me! Maybe I just suffer cause I am living myself as too dumb, with lack of confidence and with my fears? I guess this is the whole problem, nothing more… Everything should be fine if I reconnect with the reality no? Do you look for hidden meanings in life too?

Some of the healthy ways I’ve come to combat this is by doing something physical. Like slow easy exercises, taking a shower, going for walks and I used to have a brush to brush my arms. These things would bring me back in and help ground me. Maybe something like that would help you come back a little."

176130405,Great choice. You are an amazing mom.
176130406,"The thing about stopping meds for some people is that, yes, you may not relapse for 6 months if you are lucky. But the thing is a relapse may change your whole life negatively as another poster said. I got put on meds when I was 21 when I was in the hospital. I got out and moved into a nice group home and I became stable for few years. By age 25 I was still stable but I got addicted to crack and and I was facing a lot of changes and stress. By 28 years old I started to relapse. I was still on meds. But I ended up in the hospital several times and my mental health was terrible and I was in daily agony. It was just horrible all over again. It took me 6 months or so to get stable and functioning back again to where I was before I relapsed. And that is my whole point. If you go off meds and relapse it may take you awhile to recover. It’s possible that the scenario will be that after 3-6 months you notice your slipping and you get back on meds and in a couple of weeks or a month you are fine. But it
s also possible that if you relapse that your psychosis is so bad that it takes months to recover. And while you are going through a nasty relapse that could have been avoided and possibly being hospitalized, life goes on and other people are living their lives every day and growing and learning and having fun while in the meantime, your whole life is dominated by a relapse and all that goes with it."

174375226,"I don’t disagree that any addiction can have a heavy toll. What I am saying is that cannabis is highly unlikely to have caused schizophrenia outright. There is no clinical proof for it. It is way more likely that trauma, abuse, neglect and bullying are triggers that not only drive a person to escape reality with drugs, but are the external forces that cause schizophrenia in the first place. Blaming drugs is an easy way for someone to blame the victim of sz for having done it to themselves, when it was adverse childhood life experiences that was the precursor to ever having sz; and the need to escape with drugs from those experiences. I don’t mean any offence by my previous post. I have a sharp tongue. Sorry."

A careful distinction must be made between what is the hallucination in itself,throughout an isolation and independence from all symptoms experienced by the individual or diagnosed by the Dr. The important questions; Why do individuals see what they see and why they hear what they hear,no matter if the others observers do not see or hear anything 
? Why do individuals see what they see,whether during the daytime or at night,or when there is no light at all, even if the eyes are completely closed or if they were diving under the surface of the sea ?

I think some things are being monitored since we are in a computer (my delusion), but it really depends on the situation and the severity of it. It’s because I think information (1s and 0s) are the foundation of reality, not strings. So in essence, if you get the attention of certain advanced lifeforms, it can be a pain in the ass.

See here: en.wikipedia.org Loxapine | Medical uses The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved loxapine inhalation powder for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults. A brief review of loxapine found no conclusive evidence that it was particularly effective in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. A subsequent systematic review considered that the limited evidence did not indicate a clear difference in its effects from other antipsychotics.

176130529,Ok I have a question. Sometimes I have PTSD nightmares then have panic attacks the next day then sometimes no nightmares and panic attacks. My doctor wanted me to keep a journal to document them this week. I was wondering what would be the best scenario to tell her I was having to get prescribed Xanax. Now first off let me tell you I’m not drug seeking _NAME_ just they would really help out with my panic attacks when I have them and I could take one and in a flash there gone. I’m not a junkie either looking to get a fix I’m just tired of these panic attacks coming and me not being able to do nothing about it. The doctor a couple weeks back mentioned putting me on Xanax but there holding off for some reason. If anybody could help me out I would appreciate it.

174375276,I had thoughts in my head that didn’t seem to be my own. It was scary stuff. Most of the things said by the voices in schizophrenia are not helpful. _AT_MENTION_ experienced frightful stuff. But it is very likely most of it was not real. Where does one find bravery in such a case?
176130533,"I don’t see how zyprexa 10mg is going to help you with motivation. For me it does the opposite. The higher dose of zyprexa I take the less motivated and aphatetic I get. It’s hard work getting out of a chair on high doses if you get my meaning. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has made me flat and aphatetic, but never depressed or suicidal. But if they are planning on lowering some of your other medications then maybe it will be helpful at the bottom line. I would try to incorporate as many natural anti-depressants as you can into your diet and lifestyle. Like vitamin C and D, one or two adaptogenic herbs like for example rhodiola rosea and holy basil. Drink a fruit juice to breakfast every day for energy like pine apple or pomegranate, but avoid citrus juices because they clash with zyprexa. Try to stick to fruit and veggies, whole grain pasta, brown rice etcetera. Junk food will make you depressed if you eat it regularly. Dark chocolate 70% or more is good for promoting posit

174375286,"Avolition describes a loss of motivation; the will or desire to participate in activities or to do things.

She said “oh dont worry everyone does that, its like you have a headache and take a few tylenols”. LOL So i said maybe I should try again. so she says ok sure we will prescribe 90 pills. Oh and don’t worry if you use more just fax the pharmacy and Ill approve more. See thats complete opposite spectrum"

(there is no actual whole condition locate
d within the human nature) 2-Is sz an actual whole condition that is positioned in the basic nature,and it the thing who is produces the symptoms all ? If so; 3-Is the sz a mental illness condition located in some how in the psychological self ? 4-Is the sz an organic chronic disease located in the anatomical structure ? OR 5-Is sz a self-independent whole condition,and it is not psychological or organic in root origin at all ? ! It is assumed to find only single condition (one model) that is match the reality of sz as it as in itself ,this is before searching for any gene producing the sz In other words,you must look for a gene (cause) for something that you already know !!"

I was reading this thread; read it back in February but stopped because of so much going on in my life, and I will saw I have taken lion’s mane, on and off, for the past few months. I started with 2g for 2 x per day but it gave me bad tooth aches and pain so I stopped taking it. Reason why that happened is because it increases bacteria in the body (gut flora). BUT, one day I took 20mg of vinpocetine and it stopped my teeth from hurting. I haven’t take vinpocetine since, and I was still taking 1g to 2g of lion’s mane on and off. I read on this post that someone had taken 4g of lions mane and it worked for them… so… I thought maybe I was on too low of a dose. So, basically I just took 4g this morning. I’m feeling immediately better. No weird pressure in my head, voices are few, not as loud, AND the disturbing ones that have been with me since 2016 are… scary enough… GONE!!

I haven’t seen anything on drug development and ubiquitin with respect to schizophrenia. Probably because it’s such a new finding and I don’t think it’s been replicated yet.

So your argument about not having delusional believes all the time is invalid. I can work and I do not have delusional beliefs 99% of the time and I am a schizophrenic first and foremost. My other illnesses pale in comparison with the schizophrenia aspect."

Or I probably wouldn’t of made it through. it took my family a while to accept that illness wasn’t going away by some miracle lol. although my mom 13 years later still says miracles happen you could get healed! Im still waitin mom! ah love ma parents there great."
176130619,"I am big on this topic. I feel like maybe we’re evolving quickly into negotiating all the time and don’t say when we want something. A powerful man said to me when I was younger and eating at his table and going for seconds : he said ‘I like [a man] who knows what he wants.’ It’s huge. I pose the q to my folks All The. Time. Sadly in all the hot; heat of a ‘once and for all bloody battle’[my begging]: my dad wouldn’t utter he wanted me to stay… toward the end he did scrape up some angry cojones and told me they both don’t want to live with me anymore. I said I wanted equality. I’ve said I want them to tell me it’s not my fault. They can’t oblige. But the worst of it, and I think it’s the worst of man… is that they embarrass easily but can be vicious as hell too. I guess that’s why I flashed them once. Chest pounding male scratching at something… showing them we’re all adults."
176130620,I haven’t worked in an office before but I’ve found previously you be everyone’s friend but no ones patron. You just be friendly and listen but you don’t pick sides in an industrial workplace unless your getting ahead. I think your in control of this but surely you don’t move away just because other peeps are asshats. Just nod your head and smile a lot and hopefully management figures it out…
176130621,You might want to check out taking cogentin it may help with the restlessness. Are you on any antipsychotics?
176130622,"I think it is good situational awareness to read when a situation may end up volatile. If someone is giving you bad vibes then it is probably a good thing to steer clear lest a confrontation occurs. Also, I know 5 dollars might not seem like a lot, but that could potentially be three to five meals, and not only that but you encouraged somebody else to help. That’s huge and is exactly the point of this thread, that a seemingly small good deed can have a big impact."
176130623,Darling fade to black please please don’t kill yourself. You are a valued member here and should be alive to write with us and remember things can get better. Don’t lose hope. Maybe suicide hotline information is needed here. Sorry to hear (read) you so negative to your future. I was tortured by voices 24/7 for years and later had delusions that made my life worse but things got better.remember things can get better for you aswell. I want to be really old with my boyfriend I hope to marry.
176130624,"Can you ask for another option by another dr, sometimes they can be wrong, please let your dr know you have stopped taking the meds as there can be side-effects of doing so, doing you hear voices have they told you to stop taking your meds, i hope you are safe, sometimes we can’t always see that we are ill and sometimes need someone objective and professional view."

176130628,Can you switch to another ap? The no motivation side of aps are harsh.

176130630,me too. I also walk and walk around the house until I can stop easily. _NAME_
174375299,I started lowering it this morning and I’m noticing a feeling of mild euphoria and more motivation. Ive been listening to music and I feel pleasure from it. Maybe its just an adjustment period but also have to see if _PERSON_ not getting manic from the reduced dose.
176130631,"Thank you for the hugs. For some reason my mother just didn’t like me from the start. It would have been easier if she didn’t like any of we kids, but she was just fine with the other two."
176130632,I don’t know enough about cocaine to say on that. But you can’t eradicate the coco plant from the earth. As long as the plant Is around people are gonna be producing cocaine. Cocaine is bad but people are gonna do it they shouldn’t be treated as criminals unless they commit a crime. Alcohol probably does the same in excess but we’re not making it illegal. Minorities have always been targeted by the drug war. The marijuana war in America was racist and economical. Pretty much everything was either racist or considered a threat to society because of powerful reasons like lsd made people think for themselves more seemingly to the Govt in the 60s and they couldn’t have that so they made it illegal. I mean if governments cared about our safety wouldn’t alcohol and tobacco be illegal. Right? It’s all about money and political reasons. They give us alcohol to dumb us down. But I’m not a huge fan of booze.
176130633,oh I know what friendzoned really means though… there is a genuine friendzone… two people have just known each other for too long that intimacy is just strange… but most of the time it’s because the girl just isn’t interested in the first place.
174375309,I think the thing that stops me from making good friends is the fact that people are by in large boring jerks. When I come across a quality person I put the effort into keeping them and sometimes I can and sometimes it doesn’t work out. Apparently I’m also a boring jerk.

176130637,"There’s this thing where what your scope of focus is will become more dominant in your reality. You can think that “sure there’s negative, but I plan on getting past it”, or you can think “I’ll never get past the negative and it’s unavoidable”. What you believe affects your actions, which ultimately fosters more of your belief and bias into your reality. My personal belief is that my life will be as good as I make it. I don’t feel the point of my life is to embrace a negativity that I am already successfully lessening. Now if for whatever reason, you enjoy negativity, that’s your thing. I enjoy working towards something better instead of something worse. Trying to focus on how to have a more positive life is not delusional, believing your life is perfect when it’s not may be delusional, but only when it leads to mania in place of just being self accepting. Improving ourselves takes work, but in my opinion it’s worth it."
176130638,"same here. Last year i was on latuda and i became hypo, irritated, a lil angry and akesthisia so i quit. Didnt give it that long to see of it would settle down. I had just recently had quit methamphetamine and am wondering if that had anything to do with it… thinking of trying again but really nervous… seems all antipsychotics turn me sideways…"
174375308,"A fair number of Aspies do the same. I struggle to think that I do. Someone said my trying a group at the library was ‘masking’ . I’m not so sure. Even if you don’t realize it, you were masking (or attempting to mask) when you went to the library for that group meeting. You were conciously trying to be social and deliberately trying to participate for the social aspect of it. This, in itself, is a form of masking. The real you might not even go to the library in the first place, or go, but not care/remember how you were being perceived. However, you were quite aware of how the others gelled well with each other, whereas you, despite your efforts (a key part of masking) felt out-of-step. You thought about it, realized it, still tried to be “socially appropriate,” despite failing. This is all part of masking."

176130650,"Since we’ve been in Michigan, my mom’s been on my case about portion size and how it’s more important than calories. Now, I’m not a big snacker. I eat two or three meals a day, and if I do snack, it’s about a handful of whatever I get, like nowhere close to a serving. So for breakfast, I decided I wanted toast, so I got 3 slices of bread and a little bit of butter and called it a day. So I get my toast and I’m sitting down eating right in front of my mom, in the open, and I get through about half of it and my mom steps in and asks how many pieces of toast I got. I say 3, and she goes off. That’s too much food, that’s not a portion, you don’t need that much. So at this point, I’m thoroughly confused, because my mom says that a sandwich and chips is a portion, which is way more than my 3 pieces of toast, and she starts talking about a balanced meal and how it’s just carbs. But Sardonic, didn’t your mom say that portion size was the most important part of eating right? Yes. Yes 
she did. So now, I’m meant to look up what a balanced meal is because obviously I’m a fúcking idiot who doesn’t know what protein is. Honestly, it feels like I can do no right. Doesn’t matter what I do or how well I do it because it’s never enough. There’s always something wrong. And honestly, I really don’t know why she’s so worried about my diet when she’s 50 and addicted to caffeine and doesn’t drink much water. I’m tired of being singled out as the unhealthy one even though everyone else gorges on popcorn and Doritos. And that’s not to say that I’m perfect. I have a huge sweet tooth and I like sugar a lot, but I’ve been doing my part. Drinking water as my primary drink, not eating sugary cereals, chewing gum instead of snacking like I used to. So honestly, I don’t know what more she wants from me. I’m just tired of being singled out just because. Like I seriously ate a bag of steamed vegetables for lunch one time and got scolded because it’s not a portion. Like I feel li
ke throwing in the towel and just eating whatever. At least I’d be eating stuff I liked when I got scolded."
176130651,Think Of how nice it’s going to be in the summer. You’ll be growing outside. Things will improve. It’s been overcast and 50*’s here for a long time. I know how it goes…

176130653,"According to Wikipedia: ’ Depersonalization is the third most common psychological symptom, after feelings of anxiety and feelings of depression’ I find it funny that they separate these three, to me they are kind of all very alike, interlinked."

174375312,My son is in a small mecical place its like supported living My son was on clozapine and has been taken of has bloods were low they have put him on a 5 mg of something else to tide him over having bloods taken a lot he hAs put on a lot of weight since on clozapine he was only on 200 clozapine he said hes ok but before he couldent sleep because of the voices and when put on clozapine he was able to sleep which has helped him come on all ok im worried he will get ill he never had anything wrong except a bit of add in the past and dispraxia and slight touretts the doctor whom put him on clozapine said youcant come of it has can make you a lot worse which im scared now so keeping informed with his new place for updates when on the drug clozapine you have to drink loads of water and not to get constipated it could be fatal if you do. I know tbey are checking him every day but im worried
176130655,I’m on Clozapine and Abilify injection already

176130659,"Would anyone even notice I was gone? My husband plays video games all day when he is home. I tried to “play” with him this morning, and he did what i’m sure he thought was a very discreet move to avoid my touch. Am I so awful? And my kids won’t spend time with me. My daughter won’t come to my room anymore, even to watch her favorite shows or play video games. My son only talks to me in passing. My oldest daughter is buried deep in college and her own, new life. And I’m just here, rotting away. Getting fatter. Getting dumber. Getting… worse. I’m just not worth the air or space that I take up. Am I the only one that feels this way?"

176130669,In the movie “The Changeling” the way they portray mental hospitals in the 1920’s is very grim. They’re very depressing. I think the private mental hospitals were much better. I bought a movie called “_NAME_ and _PERSON_” about this famous poet who married a very unstable woman. The mental hospital in that movie looked nice.
176130670,I take Wellbutrin and I think it helps.

I just don’t feel like this is going to be right for me and I don’t want to go, tell her all my problems and then be embarrassed.

I saw some lady pull out her phone and point it at me as if to take a video and Ive had multiple people stare,point and laugh at me the whole way through. I convinced myself it was just delusion until I heard a conversation by a couple behind me talking about how weird I am and how theye seen me on the internet. Could be the voices playing tricks but its all so convincing. Sorry, shouldve made a rant thread but I like to do things in the context of music, even if it isnt very good.

It seems that lots of people the so called “INDIGO” children have gone through some type of spiritual crisis, some around 2004-2005. Sometimes I think it was collective will and a combination of spiritual warfare, cults, etc. like I don’t research conspiracy theories I would rather piece together what I have observed and known in my actual real life. I don’t detach and relate to conspiracy theories even when someone could be repeating or confirming my own reality bias. The entire world being perceived through a subjective persona so there is no escaping the mental trappings of the matrix. The issue is discerning between the madness and the paranormal/quantum and learning to embrace the multi-layered multi-faceted existence of possibly a fifth dimension and that TIME itself is not a path or river flowing in one direction, but more-so time is the ripple effect of 
actions following a continuum of results, and their effects…chaos also that existence could be thought of as a stack of papers where as different interpretations of the same thing are stacked on top of each other, and each page shows something slightly different–there could be infinite levels to reality, meaning parallel worlds would be infinite too. Neat to think about."
176130710,Since lowering my Depakote dose I’m not experiencing any symptoms? Maybe I’m not that sick? I’ve been feeling so sedated on these drugs. There’s got to be a better way. I’ve been medicated since I was a teen.

Can give you a literal headache. I believe if the physiological damage is fixed in the brain, the crazy stuff stops happening and you can handle uncertainty better."
176130722,Good luck brother have fun
176130723,with a helmet! haha.
176130724,That’s really unfortunate… I saw a psychologist that can help me get a diagnosis if he suspects it. Do you go on any support forums for the autistic spectrum similar to this forum?
176130725,_AT_MENTION_ is gonna have lightning strike her house. Amen.
174375345,And medicine…
176130726,"After you take your meds for a while, you should start feeling better. But your meds may need to be adjusted some more for that to happen. Just have patience and keep taking your meds"
176130727,"Depending on your height and weight, low-calorie diets are useless since, as we reduce the amount of calories we consume, our bodies’ survival instinct automatically makes the best use possible of the energy we put at its disposal. Our bodies learn to optimize the amount of calories we feed them. Starvation diets make metabolism shut down and cause more rapid weight gain when the diet ends. Newer research suggests weight loss is more complicated than “calories in, calories out.” For instance, two people can eat the same amount of calories, all other things being equal, and show different amounts of weight gain or loss. This suggest that people are different and even calories are different. Finally, the quality of your calories matters. Refined carbohydrates (white rice, pasta, crackers, cookies, candy) get converted into glucose quickly, which spikes blood sugar and releases insulin, leading to high cholesterol, diabetes, etc. Some forms of calories make you store fat more readily. It’s pos
sible that some calories make you gain weight while others don’t. As for “intuitive eating,” I have no clue what you’re talking about."
176130728,I get the voices only when I am psychotic. As long as I get to remain as normal as possible could be done I am safe. I really feel your pain. I can empathize with it.

176130734,"You might not, but a lot of bipolars do. Especially when they are hypomanic or manic. As he is."
176130735,Thanks…_PHONE_NO_
176130736,Yeah. It’s probably very unhealthy when the innate functions in our bodies get modulated by a drug. Don’t get me wrong. The drugs do the job for me managing psychosis. If I was able to sleep normally and rest instead of feeling stressed all the time it would be no problem. I can’t quit without making a switch to another drug. I know I most likely will relapse if I do.
176130737,Wow congratulations on both counts
176130738,Same for me. 15

176130747,"i find if i exercise i get more more energy,and that motivates me.regardles if its a video game or looking for work,anything really.we mentally ill people have to be in the right mood.its very hard for us to do anything."
176130748,maybe I had that. I had several of the symptoms.

174375354,I live in supported housing in a shared house with other people with disabilities. I like the company. I wouldn’t want to live alone as I lack motivation with people so would become a recluse. Here I have to engage with people.
176130750,"Well, you know what I’m going to say: You are your own worst enemy. And you do something else that I do all the time. You put yourself down before anyone else does. I do it all the time. It’s a coping mechanism and not a very good one. I know life ain’t all peaches and cream and _USER_ID_ does exist. But in a way, people are all alike no matter what nationality and how do you explain that many other schizophrenics have friends? If people hate the mentally ill so much, as you claim, why do many schizophrenics have friends? It’s an isolating disease but you don’t have to be a statistic. I’ve slowed down as I’ve gotten older but hell, I had friends in my thirties and forties. I’ve also worked and done many things that, as schizophrenics, we are not supposed to be able to do. You say you’ve lost faith in yourself, but I’m here to give you some of that back. Life is tough for everyone but you are doing the opposite of what is good for you. Having friends and company is good for your 
mental health. That’s why you should take a chance and make a friend. I knew a guy for six years. We were neighbors and friends and we both are schizophrenic. I was in my early twenties and he was in his thirties but we used to sit and drink coffee and talk. We happen to both be big Beatle fans too, lol. But that was our friendship. Having coffee or sitting on the front porch drinking one or two beers. Or we would walk and get a hamburger. There was a club near us and we eventually started going there to have a beer and listen to music and he was a lot braver than me and he would get up and ask a girl to dance. Friendships don’t have to be these big, serious, dramatic emotional things that take a lot of energy and work. It can be two people talking over a cup of coffee or doing laundry at the laundromat. I haven’t had a long term friend in about three years. But the opportunities were there and I was friendly with my housemate and the neighbors when I first moved in here three years ago. Just last week 
a guy at work invited me to go hiking. I hate to say it but I turned him down. I am “working on myself” and enjoying my own company. I socialize at work and try to be friendly to people I come into contact with during a typical day. I still may go hiking but a friend would be stifling to me right now. Even though you have a lot of self hatred at the moment you don’t seem like a bad or obnoxious person. Hell, I would go out to coffee with you. And congrats on being a student. The world is a lot tougher than I could ever imagined while I was growing up, but there’s still beauty in it and nice people. There’s still pockets of niceness in the world. I think you know this. I put myself down but I enjoy people. Life ain’t going to hand me or you everything we want but everybody runs into someone who likes them. It just happens and a relationship might last 5 days or maybe last 5 years. You just got to open your mind to the possibility that there are people who like you and are lonely and want just someo
ne to keep company with. They wrote all the information about harming yourself in another post. You don’t need or have to hurt yourself. You think you’re a horrible person but you’re really not. You’re OK, you just got a dealt a bad hand. But you can still live. I see how nice you are when you try to help and support other people on here. But treat yourself as nice as you treat everyone else."

If I was on pills I wouldn’t take them. I always went off pills and ended up hospitalized. So this med is good at keeping me stable. Been 2years 8 months I haven’t been hospitalized where as it use to be once a year when I kept on going off the pills. Sending you positive vibes. Update us on if they do put you back on."

They added me on fb and Instagram, they spoke to me a few times but I just relpied minimally and dry/apathetic. They like my pictures everytime I posted but I stopped posting and liking their pics. They wanted me to find them work. Before that my mother tried to hook me up to a girl in church, a science teacher. She told me to marry her and that she can talk to her parents.

176130767,"I don’t have a phone, so some times I would listen to a variety of stored voiceless music or many of my stored nature sounds on my MP3 player. The battery would last at least 8 hours. If that got boring, I would listen again but be watching TV with the sound muted. It can be interesting what you see when watching TV without the sound. You notice things that you would usually miss. When I hit the sack, I would be listening to nature sounds as well. Sometimes, instead of using my ear buds, I would plug my headphones in instead, and have the headphones hanging from the head of the bed just behind my head. That made it much easier to fall asleep.

I hated being low on cash initially, but unemployment kept my finances well until I got help from the VA pension program and Social Security. You may need a better anti-psychotic, if it bothers you that much while you’re relaxing. But if the anti-psychotic makes you feel worse, than you would normally without it, then I guess just leave things where they were. _AT_MENTION_ It sucks that you don’t entirely know what caused it.

174375377,"PubMed Central (PMC) Adult reversal of cognitive phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders Recent findings in mice suggest that it is possible to reverse certain neurodevelopmental disorders in adults. Changes in development, previously thought to be irreparable in adults, were believed to underlie the neurological and psychiatric... Doesn’t mention schizophrenia directly but does mention DISC1 (Disrupted in Schizophrenia1) There are now a number of compelling examples, in mice, of rescue of neurocognitive deficits associated with developmental disorders in adults , including NF1, TSC, Down syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Rett syndrome. This part is about _PERSON_ syndrome: The analysis of a number of phenotypes caused by the Mecp2 mutation, including hind limb clasping, inertia, irregular breathing, gait, and tremor, showed that these phenotypes were not irreversible even in adults. Accordingly, restoring Mecp2 expression in mature female mutant mice, af
ter onset of neurological disease, reversed function to wild-type levels and restored proper levels of neuronal plasticity. Interestingly, sudden restoration of Mecp2 function actually caused death in half of the mice treated, while a more gradual re-expression schedule did not. This result suggests that the dynamic (although precarious) biochemical balance established in mutant mice had to be reversed in a progressive gradual manner. Additionally, it is important to note that restoration of normal Mecp2 expression only took place in approximately 80% of cells, demonstrating that complete reversal is not needed for significant gains in function. This is a key result with significant repercussions for possible future clinical studies with viral vectors where only a subset of cells may be expected to be transfected. These fascinating findings demonstrate that deficits caused by loss of Mecp2 function in development do not result in irrevocable impairments."

176130842,My brain doesn’t work good
176130843,"I thought I got enlightened from God but that was too traumatic. God is peaceful and should result in bliss, not fear and psychosis. Why would God tell me I’m stuck in the matrix back in 2011 after a bad drug trip. I realize now that wasn’t God. I realize now it was grey aliens and something else like milabs and the sort. I thought the ultimate truth was we lived in the matrix or a computer program. So what? _USER_ID_. Now, the smartest and richest people in the world want to know and figure it out. They probably won’t."

176130847,"i can’t get this thought out of my head, that god is a person in law. and we take vows like under god, we are really saying god is above the law. and in fact a king here on earth. and we support this because we envision god to be the creator of the universe not a man protected by law."
176130848,I had a rough one today and slept all day so I’ll probably be up all night. I’ll just play on the computer and watch whatever my ex puts on the tv. What are you doing tonight?
176130849,No only black lies
176130850,"I read like over 200 pages of The Ninth House on the first day. Then I rarely picked it up again. Sometimes I read for 20 or 30 minutes. And some books I read like 100 to 200 pages on the first day. Since I’m having trouble sleeping my reading declined. Last two years I was reading a book every one or two weeks. There where some books which I aborted after I’ve been half through them. But I can’t force myself to read a book which I don’t like anymore. Nowadays with the sleeping problems I suffer from since january, I rarely am interested into books anymore. I’m always in the fear of ‘will I sleep tonight at all?’, I would like to spend my time reading just the voices turn up to loud since insomnia."

176130853,"The year was 2121 and a new pandemic was hitting the World. So some scientists looked for answers by checking out computer files accumulated by scientists, and government officials in 2020. They found that all of the files had been copied over and changed into porn, war plans, and fart jokes with one exception. It was a file drafted by World governments to deal with the pandemic. To their shock they noticed that the year 1919 was marked out and replaced with 2020. In it were words like quarantine, social distancing, and hand washing. Then one of the scientists came in and said, “Gentleman I’d like to present to you the first survivor of the current pandemic. His name is _NAME_ the former lead guitarist of a rock band.” _NAME_ stared at them glassy eyed and said, “That was a wicked chest buzz man.”"

176130865,"My final days in business involved my manager ‘discovering’ I saw myself as ‘the (flawed) and ‘hotheaded’ older brother from the movie ‘The Godfather’. It’s a story of a king and three sons. My old man said it was his favorite movie back before things got so bad for me, also in a time where companies may have been ‘nicer’. The effect was it ‘sussed out’ who was the ‘crown jewel’ in my family(at least in my eyes). It got very scary but I’m over it. With Vraylar it’s completely gone. But quite honestly, I spent my 30s ruminating/thinking about this whole experience. Similarly for those who ‘notice’ my posts and don’t understand my road trip to visit a girl… I can make that an whole lot ‘sweeter’ … to borrow a word that is popular, yet I honestly can’t stand. I was concise but I’m willing to discuss this bc it’s finally over for me."

176130868,"I think that stress unbalances me quite a lot mentally. I always call it “scatterbrain” thinking. I lose all ability to organise myself, including the control I have over the mental voice in my mind. I think that when this gets worse; that’s when the hallucinations start. But this is always in the form of normal intrusive thoughts at first. (Which I had always thought was actually very natural whilst growing up)"
174375380,"The right antipsychotic would defeat the symptoms and then also help with reversing the brain damage that happens as a result of psychosis ; it’s why I champion abilify/aripiprazole because I think if it works for you, it has a good prognosis effect If you come off of antipsychotics, if your body’s genetic info hasn’t learned how to cope with the psychosis process, you may well end up worse off I’d say"

If you’re good at avoiding sexual discussion, just skip any threads you see that refer to sex. We typically discuss sexual dysfunctions or healthy outlets. As for religion, that’s a topic we only discuss in recovering from delusion or obsession. This is because religion topics trigger some members with religious delusion and also causes heated arguments that are not conducive to community. This includes anti religion topics.

174375387,"Hi All, I suffer from Schizophrenia, having had 4 psychoses during my adulthood. I’ve recently been involved in an entrepreneurship programme, where a couple of founders were working on a startup to deliver prescription-based digital therapeutics. Which got me thinking… Both myself and my wife have noticed early warning signs in the language that I use and my emails, texts, etc. What if there were an app that people suffering from this condition could install on their phones. That analyses speech patterns in calls, and language patterns in text and emails being sent. And should it identify abnormal patterns, it sends an alert to the partner or family member of the person who is suffering from this condition. So that they can intervene by seeing a professional and adjusting medication or by intervening through therapy, etc. I believe that with the recent advances in natural language processing and semantic analysis that this is technically feasible. Would any of you who are suffering from this c
ondition voluntarily install this app on your phone if it existed? I totally understand that it wouldn’t work as an involuntary intervention - as it could further paranoia. But if it were voluntary… What do you all think? Would you use such an app?"

I’m paranoid of pestering him about it. It’s not often that I have my siblings, at least, do favors like this for me, but I still feel like a massive burden, like I should be driving on my own already.

176130903,"I was first psychotic at 17. I did not get to hold down a job until I was 21 where I was a landscaper working outside and being creative. It was hard work but I was fine. At the time I had a diagnosis of drug induced sz. When I was 23 I had another break and got the sz diagnosis. I did not work for 6 months, and then I finally had enough of doing nothing, and I worked as a temp two days a week. I coped with it pretty well, and moved to 3 and then 4 days a week. It was working with family, so if you have any connections, even loose ones with people who have their own businesses, or can get you a job, that’s what I did. I proved over a long period of time to be an asset to the company. Now I am more than standing on my own two feet. My main success is from being on the right meds that don’t make me too tired, and having a pocket full of benzos for when things get tough. Not perfect, but I get through the time. Just tell yourself the alternatives. You can suffer doing nothing, or at least build yo
urself up to working and giving yourself an income and the distraction so your life isn’t just insular and looking at your symptoms through a magnifying glass all the time.

176130921,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

176130923,"_AT_MENTION_ every divorce is different. My ex wife initiated the divorce, after years of her abusing me she was finally done with me. At the time I was brainwashed and was torn at the fact she was leaving me. But during our marriage there was no love especially on her part. It seems like you still love your husband and he may be in love with you. It’s hard to divorce someone you are in love with. Usually people divorce when the love is not there. You have to decide if divorcing him is what you really want. Can you go see a marriage counselor if you decide to remain? Maybe he’s willing to change? This is also a possibility. Ultimately the choice is yours. Try talking with your sister about the pros and cons of divorce. You can remain separated for a while if you can’t make up your mind. Divorce is so permanent. Allow some time away from him and take it from there. Good luck _AT_MENTION_ and during this time stay in close contact with your doctor. I’m glad you have an appointment to see him

I mean had to spend a bit here and there but I utilized the free section on the marketplace. Its been a whole new experience as I was used to having money and spending when I felt like it.

It literally took between two and three years to land on my current medication regimen, and an AP brand and dose that worked perfectly without side effects. Had I stayed complacent on my Seroquel, I’d be 50 pounds heavier, having night terrors, and if I had stayed on the Invega shot I’d be pacing in circles for hours. Thankfully I do none of those things on 7.5mg Zyprexa. Just wanted to give huge kudos to that statement.

174375407,"I have found out how my schizophrenia started. Firstly, as I posted before, I heard a weird sound coming from the apartment upstairs. I couldn’t record it, maybe it was too faint, but here’s a rough reproduction of that sound, using online tone generator: If it’s not a hallucination, I can’t imagine what could cause such a sound, and how/why would it respond to cars passing by. It’d have to be something quite strange. If it’s a hallucination, it would make my schizophrenia even more strange - I heard that sound long before the onset of my schizophrenia , it would be the only hallucination I heard before that onset, and it must have been a recurring hallucination (I heard it many, many times - each time the same sound, only heard from my bedroom, and always coming from the apartment upstairs ). Now to the new part. When I came home from the hospital and read a note I had written (but can’t remember writing it) there was written, among other things, that: “Earlier I had written about 
some strange things that seemed to happen in the apartment upstairs , and I have had voices in my head since that time. ” I think I found that writing. Here it is: ""First of all, most of the time there is a feeling in my head that I would describe with the word “block” - there is something that inhibits some of my mental abilities, like learning and reading: often while I’m reading I’d finish reading a sentence and notice I do not remember what I just read. I have to read each of the phrases a few times until they make sense, and so it goes for each sentence. It is as if my mind is focused somewhere else. It started quite a while ago, and I did not notice it initially because despite it being a disabling feeling you can get used to it, l like you can get used to discomfort or mild pain. So far it sounds like a problem someone with a mental illness may have, but I am almost 100% sure I don’t have schizophrenia or anything else of that kind; keep reading why I think so. About that “block” feeli
ng. I mentioned it persists there most of the time, but not all the time. When that thing goes away the experience is as follows: you feel as if something in your head physically ceases to exist - it was there before but has now been lifted off. There is a sudden feeling of relief, you may breathe more freely than before, your perception of the world becomes much more vivid, and you will have no longer trouble with reading. Now this is where it gets strange: one day when the “block” feeling disappeared one of my neighbors suddenly started stomping fairly loudly in their apartment. The first time it happened I felt annoyed as the feeling crept back , but when it happened for the second time not only did the feeling come back again , but it also gave me goosebumps because the timing was so precise at both times. It’s not the stomping that causes the block feeling in my head to disappear, because 100% of the time the feeling disappears 1-2 seconds before the stomping begins. I don’t think this is a coinc
idence, because it has happened several times. And it is not a hallucination because I’ve captured the stomping on a voice recording (when it happened again later). The stomping ceases as soon as the “block” feeling returns. It has happened several times now, and each time the block came back. On one occasion they (1 or more persons) apparently couldn’t get the block feeling back in my head straight away, so they started to do more noise in the room by moving stuff (chairs/tables) around in the room and using a vacuum cleaner (it escalated from a gradually increasing stomping to the other noise within seconds). One day the activity started on the morning, continued through the night to next morning and late afternoon - I know that because I couldn’t sleep at all that night. Makes me wonder if they ever sleep. I consider this a telepathic ability how precisely they can tell when something in my head changes, in order to start making noise. I am usually sitting still while it happens, but often when I 
am walking (silently) I hear the neighbor follow me with unusually loud steps / stomps. One time when the feeling in my head started to fade, the neighbor immediately with loud steps came from the other room to the spot directly above me and started stomping. It seems they are doing it on purpose to gain my attention, for reasons unknown to me. Because they haven’t explained me why they’re doing it and because it gives me nothing but ill effects I am assuming their intentions are not benevolent. I will now describe an even stranger event. One night I was lying in my bed, the feeling was there, as usual. I felt as if something or someone was connected to me, and they apparently wanted me to increase my focus on some mental point. When my mind drifted away from the focal point they would signal me a “no” via my eyes moving involuntarily from left to right, and when I managed to keep focus respectively I received a “yes” (eyes moving up, down, and back up, as if nodding). All of the communication fro
m their part happened via the yes and no signs and images. They got me into a very suggestive state and I followed the instructions. At the end they made my breathing stop and instructed me to proceed focusing. I don’t know if they wanted to see if I could kill myself by focusing hard enough while holding breath, or tested how intense focus I can achieve, but in the end I breathed. I am not a swimmer and haven’t practiced holding breath, and it was not a complete control over my body but a very suggestive state. Some strange scent can be smelled at times, which seems to have a sedative effect. I heard various kinds of silent sounds from the apartment above. Throughout the process my limbs and other parts of the body were involuntarily moving in an apparent manner to maintain the focus, in addition to the yes and no reminders. Also, during that time I could not make any voluntary movements myself - when I thought of moving hand or getting up in the bed someone else did those movements for me. Apart from it 
straight up feeling like someone else is doing it, it also differed from my usual movements in that they were ‘perfect’ - there was no fumbling around for the zip on the pants or door handle, every movement was performed with 100% precision."" Another things I’ve written at that time: “I could predict when they were about to make noise, with 100% certainty within a couple seconds when that change happened in my mind.” “To clarify, they are very quiet otherwise. If an otherwise silent neighbor starts stomping only after a change happens in my mind, I think it counts as a pretty solid argument supporting the theory that they have telepathic abilities.” Also, this text reminds me of another thing I had written in this forum a bit more than a month ago: I wonder if my “schizophrenia” actually is a real schizophrenia."

176130979,"Things moved really slowly for me in the beginning. Actually after my first 8 weeks, all I’d noticed was that I’d stopped gaining weight. I was feeling a little discouraged as I wasn’t actually losing. I’d say around the end of the third month I began losing weight, It was slow, but I was losing consistently. As far as it being easier, I can’t pinpoint the exact time, but eventually my cravings stopped during the fasting window. And it was easier to stick to it. I know you want like a definite time, like when will it not be hard anymore, but trust that your body will adjust. Perhaps do more research and watch YouTube videos about intermittent fasting to learn a little more about the process."

Anything that you can perform. It will pay off, your muscles will get stronger and there will be less pain, if you can think of any small way to excersise you should do it. Have a little ritual each day with small excersises. Also make sure you eat healthy foods to keep your body happy. Maybe apply some traditional medicine like anti-inflammatory herbs like turmeric to help ease the pain in your muscles."

176131006,"Hey bud- I’m reading your post and my jaw just dropped. Propranolol is FDA approved to lower heart rate/pulse rate due to tachycardia. For OFF-LABEL use/prescribing, it’s only acceptable and arguable effective in helping treat underlying physiological symptoms of anxiety/panic disorders. In order to effectively treat akathasia, you would need an anticholinergic, such as Cogentin, Benadryl, and then if that fails, it’s prescribing protocol to then use the Benzodiazapine family, usually Ativan is tried first, if that fails then Valium because of it’s muscle relaxing properties. This doctor is NOT medicating the akathasia appropriately. I won’t tell you what to do, but if you’re suffering from this, please, I implore you to get another opinion or go to the ER. They will help you. Akathasia is hell. Many of us have been there. If I may ask, is it permanent for you or do you still have time to try other medications that won’t do this to you?"

176131017,"I have had to call the police on others once. My sister was throwing a house party when suddenly things got out of a hand. It was because some girl started dancing with another guy and her ex started up a fuss. Eventually it turned into a fight between gangs. I’ve seen a few fights here and there but this turned into a full on rumble. There must have been about 40+ dudes fighting each other. It was like a small riot. They had stepped outside and the entire block was filled with people fighting each other in groups. A few were laying on the floor and then a group of four to 7 started stomping and kicking one of the downed guys. My sister was panicking and asking, “What should I do? What should I do?” She was crying and I repeatedly told her, “Call the police.” She did not want to because she didn’t want to have a bad reputation and there was this other girl telling her some stupid as ???? advice. I told her, “They’re going to kill him if you don’t call the police.” She still was 
hesitant. I finally said, “If you don’t, I’m going to have to do it.” And so I ended up having to call the police and reported a huge fight outside our house. My sister opened the door and yelled, “My brother called the cops!” Needless to say they all scurried off like rats and cockroaches with a few remaining on the floor. Thank goodness they showed signs of life and started to wake up from being knocked unconscious. Some were rivals but seeing as how they were recently knocked out they did not seem to remember much. Most fled except for a couple who were from out of town. I cleaned them up in the bathroom and did what I could to make sure they weren’t seriously injured. One tried to clean himself and left bloodstains all over. Anyway, the cops were aware of the party because my sister was super popular and well known by many people. She had spoken to the police beforehand and gotten permission to have a DJ and a sound system to avoid noise complaints. Surprisingly they did not bring up any of 
the underage drinking and asked more about the fight. I told them I had no idea why it started or who they were. It was mostly true at the time. Later one of the younger brothers involved would give me dirty looks but the rest of his brothers were still cool with me. It wasn’t like I pointed the finger and gave names. My sister was a mess but I scolded her in front of the remaining people (still a sizable amount) with her so called “friend” nearby. I told her, “She doesn’t give a ???? about you, most these people don’t they just want to drink and party. Someone almost died tonight because you were listening to that girl. She is not your real friend. In a few years she won’t even remember you. I’m your brother and I had to deal with your ???????? because you were too busy trying to be cool and listening to a person that does not give a ???? about you. Next time I tell you to call the police, call the ?????? police and put some goddamned clothes on, nobody dresses like that, you don’t see anyo
ne else here with dressed like that do you?” Her friend tried to interrupt me several times while I told her that. She was saying typical chola expressions, “It’s not even like that!” Fast forward years later. My sister and that girl haven’t spoken in years and she does not keep in touch with anyone on that party except maybe one or two people. Funny thing is I was about 16 or so at the time. It’s no wonder my sister moved to England."
176131018,"I get your point. I would have liked to be a “quarterback” but instead I consider myself a very small person who doesn’t have much influence. I accept myself, however. I have a belief that I do matter."

Suicide is worse some say, and would put me in hell, but isn’t the other choice–staying alive, be installed as dictator, then go to a worse hell-worse? Not sure how to deal with this."

174375426,"Hmm. If it does help you, accounting jobs do tend to be low stress, since it’s monotonous by filling out everyones taxes and managing big bank accounts. An accounting job is still an accounting job, no matter who you work for. So you may be able to work someone else doing the same thing. I still think something like Zyprexa and Latuda would make you go far. Abilify seems to be your go to medicine if you want to live a good life, but be unable to work. I’m not sure about the Canadian version of social security, but you could apply for that. I can’t currently work a job outside of stock trading(It really think it’s that exciting) , and I feel pretty happy(this may be a permanent feeling) from getting todays profit, so I may be feeling close to the same as you were while on a Abilify. I think it’s easy as hell, because all I do is watch for a setup and then profit, For some reason going to the gym(or lifting any weights for that matter) makes me feel worse, so I don’t do it.

176131033,"My oldest sister is moving to Mexico. I was stunned when she told me. It’s about 95% sure it’s happening. She recently got laid off from her job and she went to Mexico on vacation because she knows people there and now she wants to go back and live there permanently. She’s given this a lot of thought and she is going to retire at age 62. (She’s 62 now). It’s a pretty cool thing to do but it’s really going to affect me. My sisters told me I’m self sufficient and not a burden but I do lean on both of them to help me with problems sometimes and they are both cool people and fun to be around. And I will probably visit her in Mexico. But my sisters are my only real family. I’ve known my step-dad for years but he lives a 150 miles up north and for some weird reason I’m not sure of, he barely communicates with me. We used to stay in touch but it’s rare now. My step-mom who I’ve known for years lives far away too. But my sister has to do what’s best for her and the place she wants t
o move to in Mexico has a lower cost of living so she could survive on her Social Security check there and she might have a part-time job in a boutique waiting for her.

176131048,Yes they can intrude with any thought they want. No they dont tell me I’m going to hell. You should tell them they are not allowed to say that and see what they do.

And I couldn’t resist twin babies for my 3 year old granddaughter and a baby _PERSON_ musical octopus that _AT_MENTION_ recommended for my 1 year old grandson. I spent just under $100. I think that’s the least expensive holiday season on record.

It is a blessing to be wealthy. It also depends how poor you are. It is way better to be wealthy than being poor as it gets. I have never been poor, so I am not positive…what is it like.

This Schizophrenia has already tortured me with an apparently physical feeling that is definitely worse than a tooth ache, and completely different - I have never felt it before this Schizophrenia arrived. I would never want to experience that again (I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy), let alone being tortured forever . This is just sick. I’d hope this hell didn’t exist.

176131095,1 friend isn’t such a bad deal. Better than nothing. I don’t really have any contact with my old friends anymore so I basically have zero. I suppose you can always make more friends if you want them though. I don’t know what the makeup of you foster home is but hopefully there are some people around the same age.

176131104,"I haven’t really had visuals, but my tactiles have been quite lifelike. I once hallucinated that blood was running down my head, and no matter how many time I felt it with my hand and was ensured it wasn’t real, I still had the feeling. I also had the feeling once of being penetrated, sexually. It lasted for several minutes and made me quite uncomfortable, as penetration is not something I desire."
176131105,"I hate sleeping, I wish I could sleep 1h a day without being tired. I used to sleep 14+h a day but now I drink 2 cups of strong coffee in the morning to not sleep during the day so I sleep 9h."
176131106,"I had very good parents. But they told me I started phasing out around 4, they would call me, snap their fingers in front of my face and I was out, not answering. Later one, still pretty young, I started having suicidal thoughts and walls would move as if they were breathing. I turned from a happy full of life child to a secluded anxious child around 8. But I think, despite from that, I had a blessed childhood, we weren’t poor, we had a dog, we had a big garden, I never fought with my brother, we would go running, fishing or looking for mushrooms with my father. My father would make me listen to queen, led zeppelin, jimi hendrix, the doors. On sundays, we always had a very good meal (a roast, a nice piece of meat or fish). I would spend time both outside or on the playstation with my brother. Then my father gifted me my first guitar. I think this was the best day of my life. I started practicing a lot. It was compulsive, i would not go out or go drink with my friends, i would stay in my room prac

176131109,"While I haven’t been officially diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, I was diagnosed with “dissociative disorder NOS”. Apparently I have another personality–a six year old boy named _NAME_. (I was abused as a child so that may be the culprit). I do loose time some. But not recently. I have been told I dissociated a lot in front of my former wife and mother. And apparently I did to a psychiatrist. Hence the diagnosis. Does anyone else have this problem?"
176131110,Wow. That’s a big church.
176131111,"It takes about a month for me to start wigging out if I go off my meds. I’ll start getting a little weird about 2 weeks in…you know, little stuff like not bathing and not sleeping, but the full psychosis where I start worrying about Watchers (people that can steal my thoughts) typically starts at the one month mark. Honestly, sometimes I go off my meds just because things like Watchers and the intense paranoia actually make my existence more interesting than the boring humdrum of the medicated life. It’s scary as hell but I experience a much wider spectrum of emotions when I’m off my meds and I actually kind of like it."
176131112,"I think I get what you are saying, my first voice started as a voice from “god” and it told me to do obsessive things. I guess it started as a way for spiritual cleansing but maybe I just been lied to by religion in general."

176131114,I’m sorry but most of us ARE delusional. Sorry. Also the kid in question is being talked about by everyone else too so why call me bad for it? I’m not that good socially as you know.
176131115,Yes definitely. People do awful things but people can improve themselves and change and learn and do great good things. I have improved myself. I just want us to do more for the environment and animals and people before too much damage is done. So much damage can be overwhelming and feel hopeless and might not be fixable as such such as if animals become extinct…

174375456,"Meds are about the only option. Meds and lifestyle. You could consider brain training apps. Eat refreshing health foods. Crispy apples. Natural foods that have that pop and zing to them. Stuff that wakes you up. Exercise is difficult to maintain. Life has a tendency to shift around in it’s complexity. I think bicycles are great. If you can get even just a half mile on a bike in every couple of days it goes a long way. Psychiatric doctors come in a wide variety. Don’t settle on one unless you feel they actually care. Getting the proper mixture of meds is essential and that will only be possible if your doctor is invested in finding that for you. Schizophrenia is tough. It has a way of attacking from all sides, but if you just read through how all the folk on here have found different ways to cope… You’ll find there are near infinite things to try. I eat vegan, I don’t allow more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day. I vape nicotine but take a day or two break from that when I can. I make sure 
to sleep at least 8 hours if I can… I’ll allow myself to sleep up to 11 hours a day if I feel that’s how worn out I am. If you are feeling cognitive decline though… I would recommend finding a fun brain training app for your phone or pc. Puzzles can be tough, but that’s what makes them fun. For communication in general… Always keep yourself open to the notion of making new friends. Try to not burden anyone with your needs for interaction, but a simple hello or good morning/day… Can break that isolation a bit. Nice weather is a blessing. Don’t pass up a chance to get some comfortable outdoor time."

I’m told people with Parkinson’s also have schizophrenia symptoms. And I also know it’s not really happening but is a product of this awful mental illness I have. But it’s a terrible disgusting feeling. _PERSON_ its an awful feeling to feel like something is touching you this way. There’s nothing good about it. And if I missed any kind of intimacy I certainly wouldn’t welcome it this way, but thanks for your comment."
176131148,I know there’s not enough time in a lifetime but I feel the more people you experience and talk to the greater the enlightenment. If you could have a 5-10 minute face to face conversation with all 8 billion people in the world you could be the most enlightened person ever. Haha it doesn’t matter but they should make places to go where you pay like .25 cents a minute they pair you with other people to talk to. Not speed dating but just getting to know someone. They could sell coffee. Yes I know it’s called a coffee shop but what if the people facilitated communication with strangers I think I’d pay extra for that. Haha unusual beliefs.

Every day and all day i hear kids and adults make loud noises. Every time they make loud noises I start to believe that they are helping me understand how to live My mental illness and to break free from it (cure). Every noise they make changes my action and free will. They want me to BELIVE in “playing with the devil and be gangster”. The more I disagree with them. The more they make loud noises. They got to a point were they can control my resting heart rate. The more loud bangs the more my heart beat raises. I tried asking them to lower the noises but they didn’t listen

174375471,Its about dopamine in prefrontal cortex region in brain. Reduction of dopamine receptors in PFC causes working memory deficits and other executive function issues. Simply taking dopamine pills will not increase dopamine in that region and instead it can raise in dopamine in other parts and can even cause psychosis. Schizophrenia is linked to high dopamine in brain but lower in prefrontal cortex part.

You could try oils like coconut oil and raw unrefined _NAME_ butter but tbh I dont think that will work either. As it need to penetrate the dermis layer of skin.

176131220,I started drinking later in life. I think I was about 24. I was working at a DC and would always buy alcohol on the way home. When I went to school I was about 1 hour out of town and felt a little depressed and lonely. I used to go to bars late at night and drink until I could not drink anymore. I remember drinking so much I used to throw up and I was endangering my self for the drive home. One day I just got off work and my boss came in and bought me a bunch of drink I think I drank 13 drinks in 1.5 hours. I was totally wasted. Then I drove home and got a DWI. This changed me a little bit and I started not drinking as much. But after about 3 months of not drinking I started drinking again I would drink off and on until I decided that Alcohol has never done anything good for me so I quit on January 29 2018 and its almost been 2 years since I had a sip.

176131227,My neck hurts and my body feels twisted. I feel tied up as if I’m in invisible restraints. It’s really uncomfortable. I want a massage but I can’t afford it. I was told not to trust a chiropractor with my neck as people die every year after visits to the chiropractor. I’ve had delusions about the strange feelings and what it is but not anymore. I don’t know if such a thing could come from medication. I used to get severe jaw clenching but it went away thankfully.

176131230,I was the one telling the doc about the delusions in the first place
176131231,"For me it has gotten better. I think I’m lucky to be alive. I had one doctor recognize something wrong with me early on. He said acute stress disorder. Not a popular opinion for most people in my treatment team(s). He also struggled getting the records over too. I guess trauma causes ASD but at the same time I never got the answers I wanted or the help or sympathy – ever, which just made things more despicable. Life sucks, get used to it. I guess my mental illness early on was so bad, it was like putting up a virtual reality headset to my face 24/7 a day with sensory deprivation and bizarre thoughts and beliefs. The VR would be very low quality and resolution. It seemed to have been triggered by pot. Who knows… It seemed like my vision got worse over time but then got way, way better. It’s like another trauma happened but I don’t remember. I have weird dreams where I’m being cloned, time traveling, and living other lives. It ‘leaks’ into my consciousness or memory afterwards when I 
wake up and I think hey “I remember that parallel universe.” Sometimes I think I had a second kidnapping or cloning experience around 2012. I don’t know. I think I was kidnapped in 2011 at college. I have the memories for sure. It feels unreal still. Like it happened in a past life or parallel universe, which is what they want you to think (me to think). I mean that’s the whole government deniability thing. It can’t be proven and you can’t get help or sue. It’s pathetic, sad, and just shows you how corrupt this planet is. I almost died in 2015 too at the hospital. So yes, I am getting better but I don’t know how long I’ll live. I sort of care, but then I don’t. I realize this world sucks and is evil and fallen. You cannot win. I tried before. The world is sick and there is no cure."

174375481,"_AT_MENTION_ That’s how I was on Abilify. I never changed my diet, but I ballooned all the way up to 319 pounds before I freaked out and made my pdoc put me on something else (Haldol). When I went off the Abilify, I never changed my diet, but all the weight gradually came off on its own. On Geodon, I gained about 50 pounds because of having to eat 500 calories twice a day when I took it. That’s already 1000 calories for breakfast and dinner, without considering lunch. I was working and stress-eating during the day, so I put on the pounds. Now on Zyprexa, my long-term goal is 180, the weight I was when I started on anti-psychotics. I just hope I can get there."

174375502,"hehe… wrong topic… confused this with the other post I made… basically I also had a schizophrenic friend like my best buddy… long story short, my room mate came with him to my room, I thought they were friends but turns out my room mate was just an idiot of brought a stranger he just met to my room… anyways, I wanted to eat some chocolate, so I go to my fridge and get some mars bars and give my room mate and his friend; his friend who was a schizophrenic thought the mars bar chocolate was some type of declaration of love coz he got obsessed with me over it and even told me it was because of the chocolate that he declared me a good man… anyways… confused you post for that friend post"
176131305,that’s hard to suggest without knowing you. Maybe a hobby? Or something useful that you need.
176131306,"I was on olanzapine for a couple of years and I didn’t have any problems with it effecting the body’s natural thermoregulatory systems. I gained a lot of girth around my middle, so much that it looks like my stomach is distended. I started to notice short term memory problems and problems with abstract thought. I was taking 30 mg (a very high dose) and my doc switched me to haldol because of recent symptoms. I’ve been off two weeks and I feel better (symptoms) and my memory has improved. Given that, if haldol doesn’t work, I’ll go back to zyprexa immediately. It has been my favorite ap for symptom management."

176131308,"I used to think that God was talking to me through prayer books. I thought that for many years. But, I talked about my beliefs in Sz.com forum and the members here made me aware that this was just a delusion. They assured me that it was a common delusion at that. So, I quit communicating with this entity and the delusion disappeared."

174375497,"A famous psychiatry in my country says sz doesnt exist. He says EVERYONE can develop psychosis under the “right” circumstances. 20% of people, he argues, have at least one psychotic symptom in their lives. Most recover. He says 3% will go on to develop a psychotic syndrome, milder or worse."
176131311,"Sometimes I think it is just the way the world is and it is the smart thing to do. Other times, I think maybe it is related to paranoia or social anxiety. I cant trust people to treat me ok. Like people have a really negative attitude towards me, even on here, and I feel like I am just waiting for the time it slips out of them. Do you think I am being paranoid?"
176131312,13 years old. Uh at a junior high school in Calgary? That’s about it. Nothing can prepare me for the heaps of medical problems I would have at age 20.
176131313,"I was on welbutrin but I was one of the unlucky ones who had increased anxiety from it. I guess it can be pretty activating. It’s worth a shot though, as a lot of people have success on welbutrin."
176131314,"when risperdal made me impotent I became suicidal for a couple years…it’s important…I’m on fluphenazine, generic prolixin and there are no side effects…i don’t think it’s covering voices though so it might not be for you."
176131315,I’m awful with names. I will have to try this. Do you try to visualize their face or their name? This is something that I struggle with cooonstantly. Sometimes these images get superimposed onto what my eyes see and that’s extra scary. I prefer the ones where I see nice things.
176131316,"Does executive functioning means like going for a walk or read book, anything like engaging in a hobby? In that case yes it comprises executive functioning, with the medication i am disabled. Without the medication i am disabled too, an inconvenient nuisance."

The clock-drawing test (CDT) is an important neurocognitive assessment tool, widely used as a screening test for dementia. Behavioral performance on the test has been studied extensively, but there is scant literature on the underlying neural correlates. Apparently they can trace the clock drawing test to specific parts of the brain. I did one in a mental facility a couple of years ago. I tried and I was way off. I think I can do it now though. I was really out of it."
176131319,Yeah it can be hard to get enough food in. Sausage is one of the things I really miss since going pescatarian. Enjoy your meal. It sounds yummy.
176131320,"My iq is 120 after schizophrenia i think… I was a math major at the number 1 public school in america at the time i got schizophrenia. I read the average math major there had an iq of 130, but i could be wrong. If i get cured i think it would go back up. I think aliens dumbed me down. I over estimated my iq to be 140s pre schizophrenia and 150s as a child before i got ‘dumbed’ down by illuminati/aliens in my opinion. I talk to them and get downloads but its not real to anyone else. My first dream/memory i got was intercepting an alien frequency in the static background on the tv. I wrote it down. Felt like God talking to me. I felt like i was dumbed down/cloned back then and never been the same. i was 4 or 5 before my parents divorced. Happiest time of my life… I had a dream of being _NAME_ titor and my iq was in the 140s after recovering from schizophrenia in the future, but in this life i never got offered a free iq test and refused to pay the money for one… I had iq tests done in paral
lel universes. I also slightly remember the zennar card games in elementary school in first/second grade. I figure my thoughts, delusions and internet activity/posts ruined my career/future. None of it is real, but i share it any way. I often felt i am _USER_ID_ nakamoto creator of bitcoin, but im not. I get weird dreams and beliefs and can time travel and enter parallel universes constantly. They say the average math major iq is 130. I wonder if its higher if you go to berkeley, harvard, or mit or whatever vs a easier school. I think the work is harder at berkeley and they dont hold your hand. Some easier schools might have more support systems and tutoring like cal states…"
176131321,_AT_MENTION_ I’m not sure yet.
174375506,Saphris was by far the worst for me. Perphenazine has been the best.
176131322,Hey. Sorry you’re going through this. Were you able to function normally before your current meds?
176131323,i already quitted the meds
176131324,welcome back to the forum =) What kinda problems you having?
174375504,Yes. I’m on aripiprazole depot and I’m also taking aripiprazole pills. For me is the best antipsychotic I’ve tried.
176131325,doesn’t sound strange at all. That’s a great hobby.
176131326,Just winding down after a hell day at volunteering. Wasn’t feeling the best but soldiered on and got through it…just reading the boards and doing a bit of surfing.
176131327,Just anti depressants
176131328,maybe try some drawing too? it may help…idk…?
176131329,You’d be paying in the thousands if that were the case. All the evidence of your discrimination is in the threads. I can’t believe someone as sexist as you are is crying about discrimination and calling for punishment. Its ludicrous.
176131330,I say that occasionally when my parents ask about psychosis… you just wouldn’t understand if you don’t go through it?
176131331,I use acrylics. I don’t have patience for oils.

176131332,"Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant.

176131333,Am I within my right to instruct a Psychiatrist to stop a medication? Will I be forced to take it?
176131334,I wish I knew… I haven’t had natural sleep in years. If you find out post it.
176131335,Yeah aps can give you all kinds of psysical problems. I’ve had restless leg syndrome and trembling in my hands.

176131341,During the worst of the psychosis they told me they were trying to kill me through sleep deprivation and my poor sleep seemed to signify that it would actually happen. They don’t threaten to kill me any more. In fact they don’t do much that’s very interesting now.
176131342,None of what you just wrote is true. Pride is playing with your mind.
176131343,_AT_MENTION_ is always there for me.
176131344,Tha would freak me out a bit. If it’s me I’d think it must have changed in my pocket or something whilst the phone display had not fallen asleep?
176131345,I’ve had so many delusions over the course of my illness it’s hard to remember them all. lol
176131346,"I experience this also. What also happens with me is that if I have a thought that focuses on the voices, that very second it makes a sound. Nothing helps me like prayer though. I work overnight and the only way I can go to sleep when I get off work is to pray for deliverance from all the attacks from the evil voices, and more times then not they go away and I’m able to rest. What also helps is to literally sit and quiet my mind, like focusing on white space, or to focus on something else like a good book or a really good movie."
176131347,thats messed up
176131348,"Hmm not sure. It’s not the same as before the meds, that’s for sure. There’s no pressure and delirium. No fear."
176131349,I’ve been addicted to cocaine and to weed. Weed was definitely more addictive for me. I’ve been clean for about 4 years and I still fantasize about smoking weed. But I won’t because it makes me completely non-functional. It’s so good nothing else matters when I use it.

176131361,Thanks. I called the nurse hotline for a different reason and we started talking about my meds which occupied my mind for a few minutes. I feel better. But thank you for caring. Much appreciated!
176131362,I was in the military from 17 to 42. You get close to each other. Close quarters. Never lonely. I got sick at 38. That’s not so common.

176131364,At this point you have to go to the ER. Having these violent bloody thoughts/voices is not acceptable. This is very dangerous.
176131365,"hope you feel better, me too your not alone."
176131366,It’s so nice it’s a escape from reality for me seeing since I’m more stressed out than those little birds that die from stress
176131367,I understand the _USER_ID_. I was a violent psychosis patient so I understand the caution ppl may have in their minds. And no I’m not a drug user patient so it’s not just those who abused drugs. We lose insight so we are capable of anything
176131368,I’ve taken zyprexa twice in my life. Both times I gained a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. It did work very well for the voices however and the paranoid thoughts went away almost completely.
176131369,I wouldn’t. (AP injection)
176131370,I’m really sorry he said that to you. I wish he could have found a different way to express frustration than to use the word hate. I think he just didn’t know how to put his frustration into words. I hope that because he said he loves you that he really does love you. So that’s what I’d hang on to.

176131373,"I get really paranoid towards the end of academic term when I have loads of work and stress. Avoiding stress should help. It seems to me that I want to have a paranoia as a sort of “love me please!” cry for help. I can and do, seek and find problems that range from impeding apocalypse to difficult to eradicate weeds. Lately lI have been finding that if I set myself a problem that is fearsome but not unbeatable then I do not escalate. Or, concretely speaking, I have been thinking about how to eradicate fearsome weeds (kudzu) and I have not thought about Armageddon at all."

176131387,Nothing fixed them satisfactorily. I’m treatment resistant. I’ve tried all kinds of different medications. The best so far was the combination of methylphenidate and buprenorphine. -A.

176131389,"There was a point where this happened to me. They wanted me to carry home a tonne of water bottles once it was a long walk. Because I was not meant to drink tap water. They told me to only eat organic I wasted a lot of money for a short while. Idk, voices, they can really just take over. We have to learn to be courageous and think for ourselves and believe that it’s OK to do so, unlike what voices may say about that. But easier said than done maybe. I remind myself to not take them too literally. All the time."
176131390,No she basically left it up to me. She said to play it by ear and see how I do on 4.5 or 5mg. She even told me that I could take the risperidone on an as needed basis and that the increase could be temporary.
176131391,It’s not a life sentence ! I have.mine under control with medication
176131392,Me too. I’m noticing all kinds of things I was numb to. I didn’t think it was affecting me but it was.

Was psychotic for 9 months, including dangerous bulimia and violence and a three month section finally after a 10 day stint earlier which didn’t help in any way A year later I was back for a nine month stay in hospital including self injury bulimia again and avbsconding This was due to my further vulnerability after the previous time"

176131430,_AT_MENTION_ No im definatley lonely not horny - most of my female mates are gay anyway lol! I think im gonna be the same and lose some friends - which frankly upsets me - cos i dont have many. They dont always tell you “just” how bloody hard it is giving up a lifetime of boozing. I take my hat off to you for being sober for many years fella - send me some of your resolve and strength! Ive got to quit anyway - its pissing about with my APs - and i cant do my therapy stinking of booze. Im sure i will get over it. (I hope) - Its just bloody hard changing my attitudes to life and my lifestyle.
176131431,"nope, nope, nope and nope"
176131432,I had it from 1980-1990. Then I decided to take a break so stopped for approximately 5 years and then picked it back up. I had it again 1995-2005 but then there was some confusion and I accidentally stopped for another three years before I realized that I missed it so I started right up where I left off. That brings me up to the present.
176131433,I had the same issue. I’m assuming you tried the Psychology Today search?
176131434,Let me try to articulate this to begin with they were a big liar and fake. No better than the average human. They were as small as a mustard seed then and a nobody. No matter what psychotropic substance they take they are a horrible example of a human that is my judgement.

176131436,I wouldn’t risk it. What’s your diagnosis?

174375528,I think _AT_MENTION_ is just trolling us. Don’t let it bother you _AT_MENTION_.
176131442,As a group we can realize its good for you.
176131443,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_, I definitely have a good heart, I know that, though I might fall short from time to time, nobody’s perfect. I also generally strive for balance (I am a _PERSON_ if that is any explanation), but what kind of balance. I was brought up to believe in striving for equality, that is the kind of balance that I have aimed at all my life. However, that is an ideal in the face of the fact that inequality is a fact of life. There are two areas where this has led me to fall down. One is politically when mediating between minorities and majorities, and the other is sexually when mediating between dominance and submissiveness. I have been coming to terms with political inequality. I am half-Cypriot, and balancing the needs of a minority against a majority lies at the heart of the tensions in Cyprus stirred up by foreign powers that led to the Greek coup and Turkey’s subsequent intervention and occupation of the island. It is still an unresolved problem, but I have come to realise that 
political problems involving the power imbalances between minorities and majorities can never be solved completely. This is why in democracies there is always oscillation between different parties and dictatorships always fall. I still struggle with this issue, when to fight and when to accept, when to mediate and when to take sides, but I think we all do to some extent. However these questions are major triggers for me. Sexually it is the same. Coming to terms with inequality in sexual relationships as a fact of life. The following quote from a paper on dominance and submissiveness trends in the sex lives of the general population: An evolutionary explanation considers the biological base of these preferences. Sexual arousal by dominance and submissiveness may be a manifestation of a mating strategy which would lead to an increase in reproductive success (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ 2012; _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 2009; _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ 2014). Previous research confirmed the connection betwe
en sexual arousal by a dominant or submissive partner and higher self-reported attractiveness, as well as the higher number of offspring (_PERSON_ and _PERSON_ 2009). Generally, a higher-ranked individual provides lower-ranking individual high quality genes and/or resources while a lower-ranked individual provides higher ranging individuals a chance to mate (see (_PERSON_ 2013; _USER_ID_, _PERSON_, and West 2012) for more). Therefore, the sexual preferences linked to such strategy should be very common. This really messes with my head as I believe in true love between equals, even though I know that men and women are different. I just can’t accept that power imbalances and inequality are a part of life, and any perception of these things triggers my psychosis. I really don’t know what to do about this, how to orientate myself and find the suitable perspective so I am not triggered. Any thoughts on how to deal with power imbalances and inequality without losing one’s mind are welcome. Thank you."

176131444,35 sz for 20 years
176131445,I’m touched by what you said.
176131446,The subconscious is a powerful thing.
176131447,Do you think the voices and delusions are Gods way of protecting us from being lonely? I feel like a failed abortion tbh
174375531,I take clozapine and zoloft and lamotrigine. Its the best combination I’ve ever had. I’m hoping it keeps working.
176131448,My negatives come and go each day That is all I have to say
176131449,I’ve had mine for 20+ years it still kicks on. I’ve had to replace my outside unit though It’s 43 ° F here/6 °C It aggravates me that there’s no degree symbol on my keyboard. I’m a stupid perfectionist in some ways

176131451,"My voices tell me to do stupid pointless ???? all the time. It’s annoying, but generally harmless. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I don’t."
176131452,I had a mental breakdown due to very real factors which I’m not going to discuss. I think my brain has healed a lot since then. I think I either have a personality disorder of some kind or minor schizophrenia or something. My diagnosis is mood disorder. They said bipolar but honestly I don’t get depressed and I’ve always been kind of manic even as a young kid I always had energy and had crazy thoughts and said crazy stuff.
176131453,"I’m on lurasidone. My pdoc said to take it at night, nothing about food. It takes my anxiety down a notch from terror to high anxiety. That’s about it, it doesn’t lower my psychotic symptoms. I’ve just accepted that & mask them in public to protect my reputation. Hope you can get a better outcome with meds, good luck."
176131454,For others it might be possible but for the sufferer its impossible.

174375538,"Yeah it was a pretty cool job. You work in a radio pharmacy and make up the drugs and everything you do is based on physiology. You take pictures unconventionally with a thallium doped sodium iodine crystal. It detects gamma photons that are attached to pharmaceuticals. It take pictures like darts hitting a dartboard that slowly make a picture. It works based on _NAME_s photoelectric effect. The problem is the bulk of the work is cardiac tests. $4000 a test. The political landscape lowered the price of the exams so doctors offices took the bulk of work away from hospitals to make up the lost difference. I worked at a small hospital that was part of a network of larger hospitals. One manager for multiple hospitals. The problem with that is the larger hospitals offer higher bonuses for meeting targets, so they siphon patients from the smaller hospitals to bulk up their numbers and get that big bonus. Bad news for the small hospital. Eventually my position went to a call only position at this time I g
raduated as a rn and decided to move back home until I got some money saved. That didn’t workout. My dad had schizophrenia and I guess I got it from him. My grandma died and left my mom her house, so I moved in with her and got on disability. I still have this drive in me to work and periodically look at job ads, but I know I probably can’t, plus the discrimination of being a recovering schizophrenic doesn’t help a person in any competitive job field."
176131457,Sounds like a good idea. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !
176131458,"well my last date was about 10 years ago or more. it was with a women a year older than me who was in my business law class. we went for a hike, about 3 or 4 miles and talked. at the end of it, i tried to kiss her and she pulled away, i was embarrassed, i thought she liked me. so i drove her home. then she wanted to hang out again and we went bowling, this time she seemed more interested in me, and come on to me. and then we had dinner a couple times, i remember ordering a salmon salad at a bar and grill, and she got something vegetarian, i was pescatarian at the time, but she would be my motivation to go vegan. one time i cooked her dinner something with stuffed peppers. we slept together a couple times and i invited her to move west with me, i really liked her but she always wanted to go to the bar, and i was trying to limit my drinking. after she told me she didnt want to move west with me, i knew it wasn’t that serious and i went west by myself. it was a series of dates and about a 2 or 3 mon

176131496,My problem is every cycle i wind up living the same life with schizophrenia. Same physics and same parents and biology…its like my billionth time with schizophrenia. Nothing changes. Not sure if i like these memories or not. Its not normal. At least i know i got a really rough end of the deal and a really bad bargain. I figure god thought i was an outlier or anomaly…sort of like im stuck in this life forever in a simulation with eternal schizophrenia. In fact i wake up repeatedly after 2011 the date of my schizophrenia. Not sure but i lived through the end of the world many times. History rarely changes but does. Im starting to think its a God thing now. Not just aliens. My life could be a million times worse. I died many times and came back alive. Its time travel. Am i the terminator lol? Something like ender’s game? I get weird belief systems. I dont hate god but feel indifferent sometimes especially towards jesus. Maybe hes just an alien creation or clone…im not a jesus fan right now…so
mething aint right. Nobody deserves this. I feel like i lived over a trillion past lives. Some a lot more tragic and worse than this. Stuff i should keep to myself.

176131541,"It’s great to have a conscience and care about other people but you are just a person like everybody else and to a large extent you have to accept you can’t control everything or everybody. The course of peoples lives depends on where they were born, who their parents are, their environment and what color or race they are and many other factors you had no control over. I know next to nothing about you but if you were born into a comfortable life with a certain skin color that gives you advantages that other people don’t have it wasn’t your fault. We are all products of our environments and experiences. Being born with even a little privilege is just the way it is. You don’t have to destroy yourself or your life just because you have a roof over your head and never go to bed hungry. I’m NOT saying any race is better or superior to any other race but if you were born with a white skin sometimes you have advantages that other people don’t. It’s sad but true but this thread isn’t abou
t race. I think it was _AT_MENTION_ who said, if your life bothers you then take action to change it. Make a conscious effort to bring some good into the world and help others. You have to eat, crap and sleep. Either a plant or an animal had to die to feed you, you have to use toilet paper even though it may mean destroying a tree (hell, I don’t even know how toilet paper is made, lol and I’m 58 years old) if to get a good nights sleep it requires sheets made by poor kids or adults who have nothing it’s not your fault. But you can change it. The problem we have here is that we probably can’t change you. We can’t change your character or your personality or what’s inside you. All we can do is point out stuff to you that you already know. You’re not the only one who wrestles with their conscience. The world is a crappy scary, dangerous, imperfect unfair place. No one goes through life without hurting someone or some thing. Most people don’t care, they take it for granted (like me). I’m living 
like you but the difference is that I don’t agonize over what I consume like you. It doesn’t make me a bad person if I eat meat, eggs, corn, juice and I don’t give a second thought (except sometimes) about where my meals came from. You can analyze the world to death about every plant or animal that was ever killed to feed you every day since you were 5 years old but it’s non-productive and easily can be taken too far. It’s possible for one man to change the world as we see in history. But are you really in a position to bring down or expose companies and their shady dealings? Maybe the work that needs to be done is to change yourself and your view of the world. We can’t do the change for you but we can see that you agonize over the way the world works. The world has beauty in it, it has love and fairness a lot of the time, this is what you need to focus on more. Good luck."

174375565,Maybe if I get dementia or delirium it will make my schizophrenia dumb enough so it will not be smart enough to bully and torture me as much. I doubt age otherwise will have any impact on it.

176131563,Thankyou leaf
176131564,I think you could do better than trying to keep telling everyone how much money you get from services. That’s peoples hard earned money they paid into taxes and you should be humbled by the support and not trying to make out your getting £60k from everyone supporting you…
176131565,what do you mean by silently?
174375560,Everything seems evil when you’re schizophrenic. You’re projecting your pain onto outer phenomena.

174375563,"Back on the subject, my childhood and adolescence was mostly positive and normal. Before my schizophrenia at 22 y.o, it wasn’t perfect but I had what most people had, a decent job in physiotherapy, just had my physio major university degree, had a girlfriend who had a house for us two to live in, had tons of friends , was training everyday and shower everyday, I was extremely healthy with no diseases. Now, I can’t do anything other than eat, watch Netflix, sleep and shower once every week. I gained 150lb in a couple of years and I developed hypertension, high cholesterol, became obese and started developing diabetis. I can’t work or go outside since I am 22 y.o. The only thing keeping me alive are my good parents and I hope that they can continue supporting me because I am unable to work. I left all my friends since my diagnosis, some left me because they saw me during psychosis. My gf left me because of my symptoms and because I wasn’t able to work to pay the house. My psychiatrist said it 
could have been worse because I became slightly catatonic and aggressive with my parents at the beginning but with treatment only my mind freezes from time to time for a couple of seconds. Without treatment, I would have ended in the streets or in prison. This disease is the devil’s disease."

176131611,I don’t know that movie. What is the basic plot?
176131612,I take a red gell cap pill everyday along with my other meds. Called ducolase i think. Never even notice it. No discomfort of any kind including mental.

176131618,Sounds like fun!
176131619,Yeah its called antipsychotics. That is what dramatically helps.
176131620,The lack of interest is painful. My questions just annoy the mentally ill. I had no place to go but crazy.
176131621,No. Not hallucinations. There is so much to vision. Forget hallucinations. This is a visual disorder that’s all I’ll say.

176131627,It’s only my heartburn meds(have not been taking kemadrin as stepdaughter thought it might be making my dry mouth mouth). Folic acid is OTC. Today it took till 4.15 pm to take the dose. It’s due to be taken in the morning. Last week I missed 2 doses of heartburn med and Folic acid. Based on that the idea of going back on oral psych meds is a non-starter.
176131628,"Catatonia comes in two forms usually. One is full blown, person unable to move, remains mute as if in a seizure episode. Other is partial like able to control some part of body though some regions stiff. Amantadine and other dopamine agonist drugs useful for the second category. While for the first one dopamine agonist drugs not useful and do more harm than good. For the first category benzodiazepines, ECT etc useful."
176131629,"I trialed Scosche Rhythm 24 and it worked like a charm. It turned on, the battery check worked, it transmitted accurate real time heart rate to the monitor of my indoor rower, which allowed me to use the indoor rower while following my heart rate, and for the reason I couldn’t know my heart rate I refrained from rowing, so the fact I can row now is huge for me. ( now I have rowing for aerobics in addition to recumbent bike and stepper). Afterward the _PERSON_ also turned off well and charged well. I want to check several more times that the HR sensor indeed works well, and after I settle my aerobics, I would want to add strength training, flexibility training and cognitive stuff."

176131636,you are not wrong my friend. I’ve spoke nearly the same words to my ex nurse and ex doctors. honestly it’s a disgrace
176131637,I hear voices still even while medicated. They are a lot less bothersome though cause of the meds.

176131647,"I’m working on the synopsis, but the gist of the story is Demonic Attachments. Not really possession though the demon in my story does attempt it (a few times). The main character was raised by her agnostic aunt and uncle, in hopes to protect her from evil spirits that tried to attack he when she was young. She has a rare natural ability to help spirits cross over, and push demons back to Hell. But since becoming an agnostic her powers are very limited. She may never have known her powers but her estranged birth-parents die and the demon they attached to their family/home becomes attached to my main character and her powers to start seeing spirits and whatnot start awaking again. The demon doesn’t want to go back to Hell because he made an agreement if he were sent back he’d have to spend the rest of eternity trapped in a pit of darkness and forgotten by all. He has two options: get the main character to work for him and do his bidding, or kill her himself. And well that’s the gist of the s

176131648,I stopped losing weight too but I picked a day to have one snack. Hopefully it helps.
174375585,"Well, meds are going to make it worse. So it’s a big decrease in quality of life. Dont you think?"
176131649,Do you mean maybe health problems? I have no interest anymore and don’t enjoy things. I have no personality left that I had but sometimes think it’s _PERSON_’s and my pdoc won’t tell me. _AT_MENTION_
174375583,"just thinking about my 20’s. I think I was undiagnosed schizophrenic from age 20-26. when I was 20 I had terrible social anxiety, disorganized thoughts, paranoia, and lots of negatives that prevented me from getting anywhere in life. I did briefly hallucinate when I was 20, but only for a week, and I was smoking lots of weed back then. then at 26 I was diagnosed and started hearing voices all day long. so my question, can a prodromal phase last as long as 6 years?"
176131650,There are YouTube videos and written explanations online that can show you how to work your phone including pictures on it and the camera.
176131651,I wish I felt that I feel I destroyed my image with his family but he says with time it will get better.
176131652,That makes no sense. Attractive people need jobs too. They can’t all be movie actresses and supermodels.
176131653,I’d say mine has gotten better. I’ve hit a record for consecutive days without a hospital admission for the past 2-3 years
176131654,"its not all about you, you live on a farm so you are already isolated more than others i’d say, stop acting up and just try and support people. I got netflix and have been enjoying Star trek, been taking rests when it gets a bit too much so now i’m working on episode 3, its pretty weird at the moment i had to take 30mins bc i was spooked, hoping to build up a tolerance bc it is really pretty good, acting is tremendous so far and my dad would have loved it."

176131659,That is unbelievable. I truly don’t understand your health care system.
176131660,I’ve taken fish oil for so long I don’t notice anything. I take cheap stuff and in the am I take expensive trigycleride fish oil. That’s the natural form found in fish. I get it from vital choice.
176131661,"Yes, it’s almost 12 noon. I woke up two hours ago."
176131662,Im modest
176131663,Not particularly no.
176131664,that’s good. ask them to give them in the blisters again and start taking them again then. When i was in the psych ward they also always gave them in the blisters cause people were paranoid about getting the wrong meds. I thought that was nice that they gave them in the blisters.
176131665,The guys are like that too on dating sites. I have a friend who is looking for love and she encounters the same thing all the time. I’m sorry you’re lonely. Do you have friends at least?
176131666,"at some point I even felt like my thought were broadcasted, even few days back I had it again. But feelings are real, it doesn’t reflect the reality truth. I even webcam myself for 1min and re-view it myself, I cant see myself talking or neither my lips were moving, so logical it’s impossible, I ever thought is it possible for me to speak without me knowing and vocally sounded without me knowing, but scientifically it’s not possible because it’s too unreal. So my end conclusion which is, my facial or body language made people “respond” to it which then causes me to feel they were talking to me, this comes the reason behind why I felt people are “communicating with me” which actually isn’t, and this “responds” are not the only reason, the second reason which is very hard to accept for me initially is “superbly coincidentally”, which is truth, so to combat all this unreal and not reality feelings, we have to use truths, facts, science, logic to combat it. Which makes sense, 
at least I feel very sober now compared to the past."

176131668,"Everytime I get psychosis I start hearing my priest pray and start seeing Jesus flying and get voices telling me to kill myself because I am God. Idk why this happens either its helping or its doing the opposite, no way of verifying that."
176131669,"CBT helped me a lot. I was able to identify triggers, understand my behavior behind them better, and come up with coping skills to help with these triggers. It’s all about how thoughts affect feelings which then affect behaviors, so you’re able to break down each phase and then use healthier options to cope. I did CBT through a partial hospitalization program, and everything was covered by insurance, thankfully."
174375587,"…they say schizophrenia involves patients interpreting reality wrongly. Then why are so many of the interpretations so similar: Messiah complexes, conspiracies, delusions of grandeur, etc? I mean, there must be many, many variations of wrongful interpretation (probability-wise) , so why are they so similar?.."
176131670,"I may end up having to move back in with my mom. Work has been rough, so if I end up not having a job I don’t know if I would be able to find another to fully support myself. Ideally for me I would find a significant other to live with, but I’m starting to give up hope on that. Ever since the onset, I have been quiet, awkward socially, and withdrawn. hard to find someone who likes me and that I connect with. living on your own does have some perks though. good luck with trying again!"
174375598,Im on clozapine. Its working good i suppose !!!
174375589,Makes sense. Thank you.
176131671,Can say “DONT GO THERE” when the thoughts comes up.
176131672,"I feel for you. Your situation sounds bad. It makes me grateful for what I have. I would say find your way back to the UK or US. Conditions are much better in the US. There are soup kitchens and food pantries for the poor. You might be able to get food stamp benefits without being a US citizen. If you can get US citizenship you might be able to get into public housing. The shelters they have for the homeless in the US are kind of dangerous and dirty, but they are okay for a short while. It would help a lot if you could get US citizenship."

174375605,Yep. I got the DNA test when I was young. I have type A. It is limiting but I am not in a wheelchair. I always wondered if the CMT was connected to the schizophrenia.

176131694,Also looking Dr _NAME_ up I quickly discovered he’s also a critic of psychiatric medication which immediately gets my attention. Anyone who denies the effectiveness of _PERSON_’s has me doubting their credibility. And this is just with a quick 2 minute internet search. I know that AP’s brought me out of psychosis and anyone who says differently is simply wrong. Fancy credentials don’t automatically make for good science.
176131695,But as for negative symptoms I think its both the sz and the meds. But I have no other choice than taking meds as I am insane and much worse without them.

176131703,It’s a benzo. For short term use only. If you use it long term it loses it’s effectiveness and you will develop a physical dependence on it.
176131704,"At the time I was of a firm belief that I won’t relapse since at that point I had never yet experienced a relapse so I wasn’t overly anxious about it. Its OK u did not bother me. I hope things still get better for you maybe even just some improvement, it’s hard to tell for all of us if we will ever be back to full full recovery Did u try aripiarzole before? How did u find it"
174375595,Abilify and weed made me very irritable and get violently angry easily. I got into physical fights. I had thoughts about killing the other person and myself before the police comes. I stopped both and no more anger issues.
176131705,"I feel like I’m taking a step down also. It seems like I’m slipping in every way possible. But, I increased my l-theanine dosage to 1,500-2,000mg a day, and that seems to help with my paranoia and hallucinations."

176131709,"Abilify has been a fairly positive experience for me. I don’t really notice any side effects. As far as combatting symptoms, I think it’s very helpful. I recently added lamotrigine and it’s been good, too, for me. Abilify is very strong and activating for me, I take it in the afternoon when I wake up. (night shift worker here) I went up to 40mg from 30mg like 6 months ago. My worst symptom I think is the voices. They are the most uncontrollable sometimes. My antipsychotics definitely reduce or even remove the hostility of the auditory hallucinations. I find it important to not abuse substances, at all if you can. Learn my lesson! I was in the emergency room two weeks ago for just being in a dark place. I was really agitated from using too much and not taking care of myself. The voices were overwhelming me and I didn’t feel safe. I was at work and my company was very understanding fortunately. I still haven’t told my parents because I think they would freak. Lol. Anyways. have a good night

I really wish they would give me a decent supply of Valium tho - alot of my voices, im sure are anxiety based now. Even going out i have to film on a convert camera cos i think something bads gonna happen. I think alot of my symptoms are brought on by external environmental factors, hence i only go out the flat when i have to. Apart from the commenting voices off the fans on the computers (which i learnt on here is pretty common, even non Mh people) , i do alright. Its when i go out i have a mental burp or two."

I’m sure I would have played for a division 1 school if my career didn’t get messed up. Another reason why I was good at soccer was because I had speed. I broke a record that lasted 7 years, at my elementary school in the third grade…with the shuttle run. The shuttle run measures your quickness. You run back and forth 4 times for 20 yards each time.

Then i read stories about ppl who totally reached remission 30+ years later… like the grandma on keto diet. Who could explain that?

174375617,I think I was lucky that I didnt have any thoughts of suicide when I had that psychosis. I only had suicidal thoughts 3 or 4 years later due to coming to terms with having a mental illness for life. then it took several more years to put some distance from that type of thinking.

What matters is that you keep that spark of hope alive, that spark of inspiration that tells you to go on, that it will get better if you work on it and get help. With that spark, friends or not. Recovery is possible. I have to believe that, or else the depression beats me"

I went from waking up in a large hospital every day for 8 months at age 21, and now presently I get up in a nice apartment and go to work three days a week. I’m 58 but I am still working on getting my college degree, very close . When I was 19 and first diagnosed I was psychotic and got not even one minute of relief from scary, torturous, uncomfortable symptoms for those first two years. I was a madman but I acted and sounded normal and nobody could tell from the outside that I was uncontrollably suffering. So, if no one could tell, I figured I would keep the symptoms to myself, lol. All joking aside, I suffered and went through hell, my case was severe. That’s why they locked me up! Now, I’m looking back on being employed almost steadily since I was about 23 in 1984, I mentioned my education. I’ve done a ton of fun, cool stuff. I moved out of a board & care home in 1995 and I lived in “normal” society for 20 years, mostly renting rooms in peoples hous
es. Four years ago I ended up in the hospital after staying out for 25 years. It almost wrecked my life but I have kind of bounced back and I’m back to work, back to online classes. My positive symptoms are pretty low and nowhere near severe as in 1980. I’m doin alright."

176131833,"i rediscovered two very helpful techniques today that i thought you may find helpful and even enjoy. One practice is called fear following where in order to deal with a fear you ask yourself more questions about it and go deep in to it. For example if you had a fear that someone was going to kill you, you could go into it and then ask “well what would happen if i did die?” then maybe you’d think “my family would be devastated” then you’d ask another question such as "" and so what would happen if my family were devastated"" then you might think "" well people would support them and they’d get over it ""etc… an you basically just keep going with it until it dissolves the fear. I found it very helpful and relaxing Practicing fear following got me feeling me emotions again most of the results were great but I also realized that the voices have got me thinking about myself too much to try and protect myself . I thought the only other alternative was to get furious at the harassment and 
wish unkind things on the voices. Luckily I decided to try _NAME_ meditation (loving kindness meditation) on the voices. I started practicing briefly on myself saying "" may I be happy , may i be healthy, may i be free"" etc and then wishing the same for someone i love, someone i felt neutral about, and then someone i was having difficulty with, namely the voices. Then when they barked their anger at me i wished them loving kindness halfheartedly and then realized to be loving to them i needed to wish them to be kind for both mine and their sake. After that I finished off by wishing loving kindness to all living creatures. It was very satisfying, especially being able to be kind to someone (voices) even when they are cruel. I think at tiimes it could be helpful doing _NAME_ out loud (in the case that the voices put down your _NAME_ meditation, which they have done to me before). Anyway, yeah… I shared the _NAME_ meditation because I feel it’s a great alternative to having the voices mold us. Good luck, I 
hope you find these techniques helpful!"

And when others point out my flaws and shortcomings from my conditions it only adds fuel to the fire. But its important to remember that everyone has flaws and shortcomings. We all also have strengths and talents! So though we as SZ may struggle more than most we still have worth. And we are cool and valuable people.

174375633,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Increased prevalence of psychopathy and childhood trauma in homicide offenders with schizophrenia compared to nonviolent individuals with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, BR Rund, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and AK Torgalsbøen, Nordic journal of psychiatry , Aug 23 2019 Purpose: Schizophrenia is associated with an increased homicide risk. Personality pathology, particularly antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits, has been associated with increased violence risk in schizophrenia. Childhood trauma, more specifically physical abuse, has been associated with violence risk in healthy populations and in individuals with mental illness. It is, however, unclear how childhood trauma relates to homicide in schizophrenia. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to concurrently examine personality pathology and childhood trauma in a group consisting solely of homicide offenders with schizophrenia (HOS). HOS is compared to nonviolent participants with the same diagnosis (non-HOS). Additio
nally, currently assessed demographical and clinical characteristics of a Norwegian sample of HOS are reported. Materials and methods: Two groups of participants with schizophrenia were recruited in collaboration with in and outpatient clinics across Norway, HOS (n= 26) and non-HOS (n= 28). Assessments of personality pathology and childhood trauma were conducted, and information about clinical and demographical characteristics was registered. Results: HOS participants had significantly higher psychopathy scores, and more frequently reported moderate to severe childhood physical abuse than non-HOS participants. When simultaneously added to a logistic regression model, only psychopathy uniquely contributed to explaining group membership. Conclusions: Psychopathy and physical abuse was more prevalent among HOS participants compared to non-HOS, but only psychopathy independently predicted homicidal status. These results confirm the importance of including an evaluation of psychopathic traits in violence risk asse
ssments of individuals with schizophrenia."

176131895,"Hello, I just don’t know how to start all this. I asume that everybody here have this situation at least once. Years ago i have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, this might be right but i don’t care. I used to be on zyprexa and i just felt my self like crap. When i was without meds i used to feel things and know things, i used to have motivation to get up from the bed and do something. Now i simply don’t care about nothing. The days just pass on by and every day is the same day, everything i do is the same thing. I’m just so ambivalent and flatern. I almost don’t feel no anger neighter joy. I laught some times but it just doesn’t comes from my heart and soul. I’m prescribed 25 days clopixol depot injection. I all the time heard some strange noise in my head like a junky radio. My head is empty, can’t hear even my inner voice any more. I just get up from the bed i drink some coffe, go to the toilet and then i go to work, i finish work one way or another and i go home, i go 
to bed, and tomorow the same day. And the next day, and the next day, and the next day. And like this forever and ever till the end of time. But the people who treath me with there meds are saying that they care about me and, I’m fine now. But i don’t feel fine, I almost don’t feel nothing any more. Just flattern. And i don’t want any more injections any more. If i have to choose between this and the schizophrenia, i choose the schizophrenia. Well i had some hard times back in there, I took of knife for my mother, and sometimes had bad dreams about haveing sex with her. I just don’t know what is so wrong with me. Am I haveing an Oedipus complex? I’m 32 years and I have beautiful girl and 1 kid. The sex and relationship is fine, but I just sometimes ejaculate while i’m sleeping with no reason. In some sort of summary i just don’t want anymore injections anymore and i want my schizophrenia back if it has to be. I can’t do sport anymore. My muscules are weak. And I had beautifull athletic body 
before now i just try something but no result. Please tell me what to do ?"

174375663,"I’ll try to explain. It is like a feeling that drives thoughts, worries, ruminations, etc. I don’t really experience the feeling when medicated but I notice the content of the thoughts. It’s like you are being driven or chased by an imperceptible idea. I believe our minds are supposed to be in our control so when clouded by ‘sticky’ thoughts, images, words, even voices, murmurs, etc. it may be a symptom of OCD. One might cope with these obsessions by blinking the eyes to control images, talk to oneself compulsively to sooth emotional distress, or other bodily or mental behaviors knowingly or unknowingly. I admit this may not be accurate and might sound like mania but I do not have classical symptoms of OCD but I’m being treated with an SSRI for OCD due to my psychiatrists analysis."

176131951,My therapist said to ask myself whether or not it is a helpful thought when I am focused on some worry. Usually it is not. Then I picture the worry as a car on a passing train and watch as it rolls on by. Sometimes it comes back around though.
176131952,"Both times it was stress/anxiety related. Im afraid that I’m headed for another one, as I’m getting super stressed. My first psychotic break came from me being sued by a credit card company. My dad didnt help by screaming at me like I was the devil. He was so mad, I was scared and ashamed, and it triggered my first psychotic symptoms. My second psychotic break came about 15 months later. I started a new and stressful job, my girlfriend broke up with me, and I started a new major at college that I hated with a passion. I fear I’m headed for a third psychotic break, because I cant hold a job and I’m feeling too much pressure at home. I just got out of a partial hospitalization, and I start DBT group tomorrow, so I’m hoping that helps to take me off the edge."

Ended up having federal cops at my house and being brought by 4 cops to mental hospital. Now I have severe negative symptoms which I didn’t have before stopping meds.

I thought I was just off and weird, and that’s just how I was. I wasn’t proud of how I acted around people, and I was so frustrated when I’m making eye contact with people. These situations made me extremely depressed and I hated it. When I was starting to hear voices, these symptoms just got 1000% worse but I never thought that stimming or other autism-related calming techniques could help. And I tried…and it helps. So much. I’m done with hiding my ???? away from people. I have autistic traits…so what? I’m not required to please others who are not autistic, nor required to make others to feel comfortable.

174375682,"Many ppl here post articles without reading them. Your article says D1 IN PFC, not somewhere else. That’s already known and my psychiatrist told me the problem with all meds is that they block dopamine in ALL the brain. Your herb similarly will stimulate D1 in ALL the brain which WILL cause positive symptoms. Also we don’t care about cognitive symptoms most don’t have it. We need something for negative symptoms, not cognitive which is the least important. btw I took Wellbutrin which is a dopamine agonist and guess what, it did not help at all, only made me manic and suicidal. If the solution was that easy we would have already had meds for negative symptoms long time ago. Reality is more complicated."

176132008,"Honestly, I don’t know. It’s unlikely to be better for the people you leave behind, but the world will still move forward even if you’re not here. I don’t think that committing suicide makes you a bad person, but unless you’re going to die painfully from a terminal illness or some fatal injury, then it’s really not worth it, you know? You’ve got eternity to experience death, but you’ve only got around 80 years to experience life. That’s no time at all, in the grand scheme of things. Just because life is bad right now doesn’t mean that nothing good can happen. Even in shîtty situations, humans always find some way to experience joy. Prisoners who are allowed to socialize play games. African slaves sang songs and told stories together. Jews in concentration camps nurtured friendships. Light can still shine in even the darkest of places. Fight as hard as you can for the time you have left, because life only lasts for a moment. Don’t even blink, or you’ll miss it."

It’s okay that I’m a large and that’s the size I will get for the foreseeable future."

There is also Ambien CR which is an extended release tablet, it will keep you sleeping longer, although I haven’t tried the CR version of Ambien."
176132013,"I know alcohol works short term for relaxation, depression and anxiety. Most people drink obviously because alcohol is a drug and it gets them high. But it’s a really bad mix if someone is taking medications as well. It overloads the liver and really wears it down, not to mention what it does to the rest of the body, especially the heart. Plus in time, it will stop making you feel better, instead you will just get sicker, your anxiety will get worse and if you already suffer from depression you will definitely be DAF. Take some advice from a pro and don’t go down the same road I did."

176132015,"I used to like the local hospital, too, cuz they always had good groups, good food, and nice staff. Then they banned me from that unit and send me down south to the state hospital now and I hate that place with a passion. Good reason to stay healthy I guess."

176132029,I wouldn’t confront them. Like _AT_MENTION_ said…it could escalate. I would also feel threatened and triggered. If they are just passing by you could just let it be. I know it’s not nice though. However if they are hanging around shouting you could report it to police.

176132088,"Yeah, there are alkaline drops, but IMO alkaline water plus drops is optimal. Last time I stopped drinking the water after a few days because I expected instant results, but I started again some months later after doing research on general health recovery, and finding that tilting the blood towards alkaline (between 7.36 and 7.45) encourages the healing of all kinds of health issues. I am finishing up my first week of 2-4 litres of 9.5-10.5 pH alkaline water plus 12-18 drops alkaline drops (of alkazone brand) a day, and just started adding a scoop of a green vegetable powder to my drink 2 times a day. I am also avoiding dairy and limiting wheat intake, and eating more foods high on the alkaline food list like boiled veggies ( fav dish is broccoli, Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes, with zero added fat) and avoiding acidic foods like meat and soda (soda is especially bad, but I can get away with eating meat here and there.) There’s a PDF of a PRAL chart here . It is a list of many common foods 
organized by how alkaline and acidic they are (negative is more alkaline ) My head pain is going away! My head pressure is going back to the old levels where my brain felt comfortable again, not like it’s trying to jump out of my skull all the time. I am actually looking forward to going out now. Maybe in a few more days. My voices were already very low, but it’s getting very hard to engage with the voices now. I credit antipsychotics and Amyloban 3399 largely for that. My joint pain is diminishing, to where I can walk up and down stairs without needing to do half-steps. My shoulder pain is going down big-time. I can sleep more on my side now. Hand tendonitis is reducing (could be due to vitamin B6 supplementation and hand exercises too.) All in all, alkaline water and diet seem like a win!"

The thing is, I think a lot of women as they have been crucial in my mental health recovery journey.

I took antipsychotics (first Olanzapine and then Amisulpride) for a year from 2010-2011 but chose to stop them due to the horrendous tiredness and exhaustion they caused daily. The mental health professionals understandably didn’t want me to stop them - and the withdrawal process was indeed unpleasant - but I couldn’t take such exhaustion anymore. Thankfully it turned out I didn’t really need to keep taking them anyway, as the symptoms for which they were originally prescribed were not particularly there anymore. It’s possible I may be re-prescribed an antipsychotic soon due to a current relapse in my condition but my Community Mental Health Team currently seems very incompetent; I did a separate post about that yesterday."

I don’t even know of such a presenter you speak of. Like talk show host or news anchors are you referring too? This is a pointless discussion.
174375732,Yeah it’s honestly so horrible to be sleepless! I’m definitely going back to my old med.
174375738,I think negative symptoms reduce sex drive maybe.
174375731,"This is precisely why the “I can you can” attitude is flawed: unless you adopt a strong ideological stance, imbued with rather moralistic overtones, you cannot claim that “self-motivation is under our control”. This is contrary to what we know (now) about the human mind and the biological, rather than purely psychological (as suggested earlier by _PERSON_) basis of negative symptoms. In short, self-motivation is the effect, not the cause of improvement. It’s curious how depending on the debate we take a deterministic or non-deterministic view of the workings of the mind."
176132168,"I am currently living with family (my former stepmom and the other woman that raised me). The room is already furnished with a bed and draws but it’s a pretty small room but I am happy with it. I’m a bit too messy with clothes on the floor but she has not complained thankfully as that’s my clothes for the next day. I might be getting a apartment to live in around or before Xmas . My bedroom is usually my haven where I used to stare at the ceiling for hours but now browse the forum n read n rest. I need to be able to withdraw to my room. My favourite decorating style is gothic and then also hippie n Native American earthy natural style too. My favourite clothes style is gothic too n then punk n hippie n earthy n then nice dresses etc but it’s to much maintenance for me to dress gothic n punk and I don’t even have the wardrobe to do so as I have been given most of my clothes n received from second hand shop but I love my clothes I have n appreciate them.my dads wife gave me some beautiful c
lothes that were hers.colourful gorgeous dresses mainly. How are you naturally cured? I have not seen you around for a while nor Saadiqa ,Nomad,anon and a few others. Hope you guyzzz are all well."
176132169,So here’s the thing. I’m male. I used to pee in friends places but didn’t want to hear the sound of me peeing so I naturally used my aim to hit the bowl without hitting the water… In some houses it became weird for my friends and they actually bailed me up to tell me it’s natural to hear sounds in their toilet…true story. I’ve learned to pee where people hear me now because it probably isn’t as big a deal as you think…and obsessional beliefs of toilet habits is really in the realms of the mentally ill.
176132170,Do you have access to a therapist? Maybe they can help you work on some of the issues that you’re having in relationships. Or even just talk through what you’re experiencing and give you some ideas on how to cope.
176132171,The government is mad at me for talking to much. They want me to be quiet. They are trying to take away my disability. They sent me a letter in the mail for review of my ssdi. They want me to conform they are mad because of what I said yesterday. Now I’m afraid I might lose my benefits for telling the truth they want me to shut up and conform to society they dont want me to be woke.
176132172,Strong black coffee without milk on an empty stomach can make me vomit. Maybe add milk and make it less strong?
176132173,Are you referring to catastrophizing? Even neurotypicals are prone to it. Psych Central – 17 May 16 What is Catastrophizing? Catastrophizing is an irrational thought a lot of us have in believing that something is far worse than it actually is. Catastrophizing can generally can take two different forms: making a catastrophe
176132174,_AT_MENTION_ what happend with work? Did you go part time? Are you feeling better since last month?
174375736,I’m schizo affective too. I just had a ketamine binge. I do feel like the meds definitely block it a little bit. If you’re on the right meds and have a healthy mind it is the most beneficial drug to me. It caused me mania edging on psychosis. But it helped a lot of things. It is the only psychedelic drug that works on my meds and I feel it agrees with me a lot. I have never been so clear. Indeed everyone acts differently. I’m not on lithium but an antipsychotic antidepressant anti anxiety and anti drinking drug. It seems to interact fine with these. I need a long break but it didn’t interfere with my functioning. Good luck bud. It also zapped my trauma issues. I’m sorry but I’m impressed for once with a drug. I used to not crush it up enough it’d make me sick but since crushing it up I no longer got sick. Umm I think it’s nothing like any drug you’ve tried if you haven’t experienced dissassociatives. I think it is less harmful for me because of how sedating it is. Don’t drive o
n it or walk on the street either.
176132175,"Effects like that can go away sometimes. Show the pdoc that you’re willing to follow his instructions, and then ask them if they will change your med’s. All the ap’s diminish us in one way or another. Even the ap’s I find that are the best for me weaken me physically. It sucks, but there is no alternative."
176132176,I feel your pain brother
174375740,"Thanks everyone for your thoughts. They let me out for lunch with my family, which was great. Despite crazy drug cocktail last night, only slept a few hours. I’m not manic, think it might be a side effect of abilify. Trying Rexulti now. _PERSON_ really hungover from all the sedatives. So just told them I’m not taking the Seroquel tonight, they were fine about it. It’s fine here, all the staff are nice and it’s largely empty."
176132177,"I use to be obese, 240lbs. I can’t sleep at all, unless I take drugs. I have no friends. I’m not wealthy. Quitting smoking was damn hard, but I did it. I’m so glad I did. We are all a little damaged. Welcome to the club"
176132178,"_AT_MENTION_ They don’t have a spare computer at the hospice, so I do only things that don’t require one. Most of what I did last week was sorting patient medical records. They gave me a big stack and a patient census, I sorted the records. They gave me new patient charts, I put the pages in the right order. Easy peasy, anyone can learn how to do it! If you have a Goodwill near you, check into their work program. They have a program separate from the charity shops where they train people to re-enter the work force. When I interviewed for that job I turned down, the receptionist told me she was there twice a week from a Goodwill placement. I think you could tell them you’re only interested in volunteer work. Goodwill works with a lot of outside agencies who request staff from them. I encourage you to try it if you think you’d be interested! Getting out of the house has been really beneficial for me."
176132179,Creativity is also writing music.
174375741,"I was 30 years old in 1998 and I lived in America. I was married and we were living in a 2-story house in Atlanta. I was a Quality Manager in one Internet firm and suddenly I started hearing voices in my work place. These voices were ‘You are with the Devil’. 1998 was quite good, but the year 1999 was much worse when I started having more voices such as ‘You drink beer’ while I watched TV and when I used my home computer I had voices on the voice of Bill _NAME_ ‘you are so low’, ‘put that pen down’ and so on. When I had a trip with my former US spouse in New Mexico in September 1999 I had serious delusions how people used the satellite networks to analyze and communicate with me. I even had drawn pictures in my notebook how this satellite system worked. Today when I am looking at these drawings I understand that they were nonsense and pure delusions and hallucinations. This is how my schizophrenia started in America over 20 years ago."

176132182,Thank you! One to try.
176132183,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ I had some mixed moods today that started off as deep depression. _PERSON_ real irritable for a while. Hope you start feeling better soon.
176132184,"I just sleep when I’m tired usually. I might take naps. I can rarely get things done, so I usually have something to do."
176132185,"I’m mostly heterosexual, but I have a gay impulse every once in a while. I don’t intend to act on that impulse because it might bring a lot of people into my life that I don’t want in my life. I’m very protective of my privacy."
176132186,"When I was in rehab in Florida/had an amazing program and there were so many young men who had been through severe trauma, whether witnessing war or sexual abuse and violence. You’re not alone, I’m not sure if you’re a woman or man but I think maybe trauma could have led to your addiction issues, more-so than Abilify? I dont know for sure Abilify does help me a lot. It doesn’t make me feel impulsive and those side effects went away…but you would prob. really benefit from being in counseling…no reason to be scared, but processing trauma is a healing experience…it seems to have helped people. I’m learning to allow myself to experience rage/anger and sadness/emotion. I prob. would benefit from a good psychologist too but I do have an addictions counselor and I’m doing group therapy. You could search online for a zoom group for therapy or maybe a private zoom chat. I think that would be best! That way you could talk to others and get peer support. Peer support can be really helpful an
d save lives."
176132187,"Life just sucks sometimes. I’m sorry you’re having a rough go of it. You’ve sounded frustrated in your posts lately. I really hope things start to look up for you soon. If things get desperate, don’t forget about those crisis hotlines, your pdoc, and even hospitals. Get whatever help you need. You matter, and you are worth it."
176132188,Definitely! I try to avoid family functions and don’t invite my friends over much if at all. I prefer socialising behind a screen and typing. I value the time spent with my husband and parents but after an hour or so I get tired and need a break. I’ve always found solitude to be energising. To write in my journal and read and reflect… If I don’t get to do these things a lot I’d go crazy.
176132189,"I’m telling you though, you’re better off communicating these feelings and thoughts or it can ruin your relationships you already have. Erotomania ruined my relationships and made me shut down and close off my heart almost completely. Some openness is necessary to keep from sinking too deep into it."
176132190,It’s probably a placebo anyway. I’ve always had my suspicions about my psychiatrist.
176132191,"_PERSON_, some things i regret. I feel stupid afterwards. I feel like a total dumba$$."
176132192,I hear you. I was also very terrified. I hope you will have some freedom from the symptoms that you are currently experiencing.
176132193,That sounds like a pretty bad waste of money if you ask me.
176132194,some private thoughts of my own rocked my mental boat so much i am a nervous wreck over nothing right now. i feel so alone and lonely but i also cannot handle a person in my “real” life right now. i don’t see a way out. _NAME_:

176132198,"I was much worse but now I am doing much better in many areas. But currently battling: Complete change and loss of previous self, decline in functioning, loss of passion, anxiety, sleep issues, night time fears, significant need and want for solitude, overstimulation, fear of becoming psychotic, motivation issues, social anxiety, lack of activity, ‘paranoia’. May be getting ECT to resolve some of this. I had other bad symptoms like confusion, racing thoughts, clumsiness, paranoid fears of being poinsoned, harrassed, monitored, but they were resolved with AP meds. I am a fighter. BP1 /w psychosis, schizotypal, GAD."
176132199,"the suicidal feeling is the worst because i know it will not get better, stuck with bed bugs which have me triggered 24/7 which is worst thing ever, brain damage from benzo withdrawal on top of already having experienced psychosis for years in advance so mentally and emotionally i am more ?????? than ever because now even reinstating the benzo doesnt make things better, my parents are even depressed now and i cant talk to them about anything because they got their own stuff to worry about. ive just spent the night sleeping in a room with an excessive amount of cimexa in an effort to kill the bugs using myself as bait but my chest and stomach hurts and airways dont feel too good from breathing it in the whole night. at this point _USER_ID_ how much it hurts my family im done with life, ive been looking into final exit for a few days now, thing is i dont even feel too bad right now but i have my many reasons and even if no one understands only i know everything ive been through and what my future loo

Maybe I still need my ap in order to accept some disease like this, but lol, this is new… It’s sad, I feel lonely now … But i clearly experience problems in my thinking and talking yeah… If you want, i’ll post a selfie of me in a few… It looks like syndromes like this have some clear physical features… Welcome to my shame and paranoia now with this…"

174375758,"I just wanted to share a bit about my life with being diagnosed with sz. I lost about 20 years is the way I look at it. I was diagnosed at about 22. I was forced into the hospital against my will. Major trauma. Then I didn’t about 20 years on Haldol which is basically a tranquilizer. Major bummer as my life consisted of hanging out n my apartment, going to psych appointments to get meds and visiting my parents on the weekend. I changed meds to Abilify at about 45. That was a major change n the positive direction for me. I started back to work part time at a store at about 50. Was there fir about 5 years and then decided I wanted to help people n their recovery so I became a peer support specialist. Now I’m 62 and helping people n their recovery as a recovery coach. I guess my point here is that work is possible for I’d say a large percentage of us. I feel like I lost 20 years but I also feel blessed to make a contribution to our community n supporting people in theur recovery process. In this 
case work is a double positive in the sense that I’m working and making money and also u get the food feeling of helping some one else. Go for it guys. Don’t look back on your life thinkng that u lost time. Time is the most valuable commodity out there. Good luck man!"

176132303,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

176132368,"There really is barely any idea of what causes mental illness. Even things like the dopamine theory have very little evidence backing them up and are solely based on the idea that meds that decrease dopamine help symptoms. But when they actually run studies looking at dopamine in people with psychosis’ brains, there is no difference in level of dopamine, or the studies were done on people already on meds that influence dopamine so it is not possible to tell what differences were natural and what was caused by the meds. As for the autoimmune vaccine thing it is very rare, but definitely very unfortunate for those it affects. Also note that these studies have found that literally anything can trigger autoimmune disorders in these people, sickness itself can trigger it, stress, injury. So even if they went their whole lives not getting a single vaccine, it is likely they would still get their disorder because their body is predisposed to it for whatever reason.

176132413,"There really isn’t a “Cure”… there is only the vague but stable capacity to grow into and perhaps out of the effect of the experience. I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’ve had this delusion and all the reinforcing hallucinations for 7 long years… and while I have made it about 90 percent of the way back to normal… it’s still a pain at times… and I might easily still have trace hallucinations for the rest of my life. Those occasional states of it setting back in… dire moments of panic… bad visions… the need to immediately re-establish self-control just to find trust. It’s complicated… you gotta find what works for you… I found coming to understand what trust is, why I need it, what I can actually trust… even just in my own sense of motivation and appreciation of other things. Heres some of my mantras… I like humanity, we’re about to go to space I like the universe, it’s so intricate and all of these insanely cool things are possible I like people, not all 
people, but there are people I do really appreciate, especially those who are trying everyday to establish a brighter future for humanity. I can make it through another day… I’ve mad it through hundreds upon hundreds of days. I can make it through this shift of work… it’s only 6 hours and then I’ll be back home Ultimate final note (I mean I could go on all day [cause I have to I also have this illness]): It’s being trapped in the ongoing moment of life that is one of psychoses strongest pillars… the importance of the moment has to be challenged. What is happening in an immediate instance should not define nor constrain your sense of what life is in general. There is more going on and an almost infinite list of things to live for and new things to try."

Both of these substances help to improve sleep too thus lack of quality sleep at night might be one reason for lack of emotions. _PERSON_’s mane mushroom and omega 3 helps to give vivid dreams at night may be it too help to activate mind but zinc and phosphatidylserine is the best pick.

174375821,"Do you think animals have a soul/consciousness? My voices told me they must not have it, because then I can’t be tortured after death.They didn’t tell me what relation do these 2 things have, other than saying “It would be a chaos” if they did have a soul. They’ve also told they don’t care what I did to animals (I may have fed my aunt’s dog a snail once when I was a kid, can’t remember if it was me, my brother, or my cousin who did it; but the dog died some time after that, I don’t know if it was because of him swallowing the snail), but they “care” (not emotionally, but logically) about what I did or would have done to people, probably because they assume or “know” that animals don’t have a consciousness. My schizophrenia has dug up various memories I didn’t even remember. One thing the inserted thoughts or voices keep saying is that I tortured my cousin. One time I kept the volume of the TV all the way up, because her father was talking and laughing so loud (he was d
runk at the time; it’s typical for him, if he gets drunk, to say something he finds funny and then laugh at it, and then repeat that over and over again) I couldn’t hear the TV. I think I was listening to it to escape from my anxiety. She asked if I could turn down the volume and I told I can’t because his father is talking too loud. The voices are saying she maybe tried to sleep (I can’t remember if she told that or not), and if I didn’t let her sleep it was a torture. I don’t know why I was blind to her perspective and didn’t turn down the volume; the voices are saying it could have been either because I was mad at his uncle, or I was obsessed with listening to the TV. The voices now have a 2 theories why I got this schizophrenia to control me: 1) because I have obsessive ideas, or 2) because I’m stupider than every other person (they call it mystical stupidity), and they’re saying either of them could be a flaw of my soul, which is why I need to be tortured after death forever - otherwise 
I might reincarnate somewhere else and bother the people/beings there. They’ve also told those beings may have genetically engineered themselves to be psychopathic, or free of compassion, because compassion would limit them - they couldn’t torture someone eternally if they had compassion. This is not my delusion - it’s just what the voices/fake thoughts have told me."

174375835,"Hi again I’ve just been going through some of my past reports on my brain mri scans. One particular word on one of my reports bothered me for awhile. That word was ""infective "" I wasn’t understanding why it was in my report. I asked the radiologist who wrote my report and he said its medical jargon, and a broad term used for neurologists to interpret. He said it also means its possible infection occurred at some point but impossible to say for certain if it’s the cause in my case for my symptoms. My physical symptoms as you know are drowsiness drunkenness and clumsy and awkward. Anyway no diagnosis from any neurologist. Also stable on my report is written. The radiologist kindly interpreted that as meaning no change from previous scans so stable means no change. I just found it all a bit confusing but the neurologists are the ones who interpret the reports and in my case, there’s no infection or MS or any other neurological disorder. Maybe small vessel disease but infective kind of concer
ned me when it popped up in my report last year…it didn’t pop up in any previous reports before that. Just on my last MRI report. I wonder do people with schizophrenia have lesions on their brain more than people who dont have schizophrenia or indeed if infective is a word used on MRI reports in people with schizophrenia. I remember another neurologist telling me a process may be happening but he could not elaborate further. All this woozy head is very annoying as is the clumsiness and awkwardness. Interesting I think the word infective out of nowhere. Just thought I would mention here. Could be a mental process happening on my brain maybe. Who knows. I’m going to ask for another scan soon. A third neurologist told me I should have a yearly scan and clinical review so they all said different . I was going back and forth to neurologists since 2014 because I didnt feel right and thought they were hiding something from me. I said this to my main neurologist and he sent me to a psychiatrist which is where I

174375841,"Couldn’t you say this about any individual growing up? I would be wary of thinking of schizophrenics as presenting something like a shared culture that we are not allowed to practice in the societies we live in, as the indiginous tribes examples would suggest. The idiosyncrasy of positive symptoms is constitutive of them. (ask yourself if there would be such a thing thinkable of a community sharing the same hallucination - I would think we would not be speaking of hallucination anymore). Schizophrenia is not so much characterized by its own positive culture rather than by its friction with a shared world in general. There has been some research on values in schizophrenics. Seems like most are quite comfortable in the contrarian position. (You only have to look on the forum for the posts denouncing ‘normie’ behaviour and so on.) The very phrasing of the dilemma in terms of assimilation or outskirts seems to me to reflect a problematic relationship to society already, for it reflects a view of

In 38 year’s of paranoid schizophrenia that was my only violence, and to tell the truth I don’t even know if that incident qualifies as violence. Oh yeah, before that happened, there was this guy who kept bugging me whenever he got the chance so one day I grabbed him by the throat and banged his head against a wall and choked him, it was nothing serious though.

Then my doctor recommended Invega injection once a month. I have been feeling pretty bad. I have no motivation to do anything. Getting out of bed is a struggle. During the day I am up for a little bit but I just go back to my bed to lay down out of boredom and no interests in my old hobbies. I feel bad cause I stay with my parents and I feel like I’m not contributing anything to the household. Does anyone have advice for getting some motivation or feel similar? I hope I’m not the only one out there.

I hope I make it but I need no one in my body first. I want to hire a private investigator to help me to fight for my rights and for justice. I can’t let people get away from doing this.

174375892,"How could your _NAME_ ex-colleague know that you were leaving your house early in the morning and drive 45 minutes to intimidate you, unless he could see out of your eyes? First of all anything (geostationary satellite surveillance, leprechauns, and unicorns) is more plausible than the ability of a real other person having the ability to see out of your eyes. I suggest coincidence as being the most plausible rationalization. A more pertinent question I think however is 'Why do you think that he can see out of your eyes?"" My rationalization is pretty trippy, and I would not want to trigger, so please read on with caution. According to my psychotic experience, some posts on these forums, including this recent one and quite a lot of scientists as detailed in this previous posts of mine I think that someone else is looking out of my eyes, but not a real physical person. It seems to me I share my mind with another alter ego, variously called, the “over I”, “impartial spectator,” “invisible ha
nd,” “generalized other,” “Other,” and “super-addressee”. In order to keep this part of mind hidden it is necessary that it be endowed with scary qualities, and the feeling that another real person (such as your _NAME_ ex-colleague) can see out of your eyes is one of the last (voices being the last), ways of keeping the other, necessary for the function of self, hidden – as suggested by _NAME_ in his book “Others in Mind.” In other words, schizophrenia too may be interpreted using cost-benefit analysis. Believing that you are being victimized by a member of the _NAME_ is bad, but it may be better (have more benefits than costs) than realizing what _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ etc theorize is looking out of our eyes. Perhaps you can make friends with your ex-colleague. By the way, my paranoia is subsiding a little but, I am generally too scared to mention it here. I have even considered the possibility that you, _PERSON_, may be the person that I fear is out to get me! Have you considered the 
possibility that I may be your _NAME_ colleague?! I am not, I assure you, but so might he."

But it’s just stuff, and stuff can be replaced (often with better stuff!). I have a roof over my head, food to eat, internet, a safe place to call home, and generally good health. SZ can get ya down if you let it, so it’s important to be in treatment. The past couple weeks have been rough with the move, but we made it 1500 miles without getting pulled over, losing a tire, or being in an accident. I have a lot to be grateful for.

176132755,"Perhaps we don’t, but the question of whether we live in a dream is worth asking even if it upsets our well-being. But by waking up we know at least that up to that point we’re dreaming, unless we only dreamed that we woke up, but even then we wouldn’t be wrong to believe that we had been dreaming all along. I don’t see it as a “flaw”, just an epistemological constraint. You could make a similar point about predictions at a quantum level."

176132758,I ‘quit’ drinking once. Then I moved up to 1 glass of wine per night. Then I wanted to up that… That’s when I quit drinking for real. This was like 4.5 years ago. It was obnoxious because my step dad (who I was living with) is an alcoholic and he continually ask me if I want a drink. He couldn’t imagine why anyone would want to quit drinking I guess. GL

That’s what happened to me at the start but then I got real voices. Has your pdoc warned you that you could get real voices if not properly medicated? because no one warned me

But she put it on her little inhouse reminder program so that she’ll hopefully get info on it asap. She said it’s so stupid that _PERSON_ doesn’t let them know about anything FDA passed, unless they get samples from the company. And they’re not allowed to even give out the samples. But my pdoc used our phones to go outside her work computer to read the info we had on it. She said once she’s “allowed” by _PERSON_ I’ll be getting RXed it. She is not thrilled that her office is not doing everything they can to keep up, but they are told their newest drug to push is Vraylar…allergic to it! She said that they’ve had 3 people have the same reaction I had to that, from that pdoc I fired for just upping it and telling me to suck it up and take 16 benadryl a day. ?????.

When I got changed to Zyprexa, my whole life turned around for the better. Maybe something new is going to work better for you. You have a bit of room to go up on the Zyprexa, but if you’re having breakthrough symptoms at 20 mg, it might be time to make a switch. Good luck! Your pdoc will know best what to do."

176132809,I went through a period where I couldn’t sleep twice. Both times it lasted for months. I would go days without sleep and be so exhausted. But yet I couldn’t fall asleep. It would take completely exhausting myself for 3-4 days before I’d finally crash. And then I’d get like 6 hours of sleep only. Truly awful!

174375902,"I didn’t say negative symptoms aren’t real. I said I have them too and they are very difficult to contend with. I’m sure you’re experiencing them too. That doesn’t mean you can just give up, Which is what you seem to want to do. Every time someone tries to help you, you just make more excuses. I was trying to help you by pointing out the fact that some of us live with the same symptoms and live productive lives. It’s possible. And it’s possible without some sort of special medication that may or may not work."

176132817,"In and out through my nose, in a controlled way, opening up my chest and airway, with good posture helps me. I can describe it: the air “migrates” rather than jumping in and out. It’s smooth, quiet, slower, but it took me some time to learn how to do it without thinking. I keep my mouth shut and my jaw relaxed, then breathe through my nose. I read that it helps with sleep too, and that the best position is on your side, so I do it to fall asleep. At first I forgot, now it’s my only way. It enhances my endurance in running. When I maintain nose breathing while breathing slow, fast, relaxed or in all conditions, it becomes my default."
176132818,"I think ur description is very on point actually. It’s about that too. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ It’s really encouraging to hear and that u can decipher her look is a very positive sign _AT_MENTION_ I just looked up the definition of wistful, It’s not regretful longing, it is just longing in general.

176132819,"If you are experiencing too many coincidences atm, it could be the onset of psychosis. That is how my psychosis always started."
176132820,"Depends on the AP, the dosage, and you. There are trends among different APs, like Olanzapine causes weight gain in a lot of people, but it also depends on you (Your metabolism, genetics, biochemistry, etc…), different people experience different side effects or in some cases no side effects at all. There really is no definitive answer to your question, you just have to try a med and see what happens. I’ve been on AP’s for almost 18 years, all my side effects happened in the first years (diabetes, cholesterol) but I learned to manage them, haven’t had any new side effects in over 15 years."

176132825,"Most doctors will first request a CT scan then follow up with an MRI as needed. The CT scan is much quicker and isn’t enclosed. The CT should be able to detect most tumors, cysts, etc. If the CT is inconclusive or shows an anomaly, it is usually followed up with an MRI since that typically provides much more detailed information and can also provide information for other conditions such as MS. Note that a brain MRI requires an additional open “mask” over your face that holds your head in place and aids with the imaging (the “mask” has large coils). Also, note that diagnostic imaging can also detect congenital structural abnormalities that may not necessarily be associated with your current symptoms. They refer to these as coincidental findings. This happened to me. I found out I have a lemon sized arachnoid cyst in my brain plus Chiari I malformation (both congenital birth defects apparently) when I went in to the ER with sudden onset double vision some years ago. I had a CT done at the E
R and a follow up brain MRI. Neither birth defect was ever conclusively tied to the double vision and the double vision resolved after 4 weeks."

176132827,"Ive been worried for some time that im crossing a line beyond sz and into insanity. I get these dream like states where my eyes are open. As an example I was seeing and feeling the emotions of what it would be like to be a kid walking on a trail with my mother. A bear was on the trail and you can figure the rest out on your own. Other examples are just all showing me how fragile life is. A lot of us humans get to die of old age. But I remember, since 4 or 5 yrs old, always being bothered about how insane things do happen. Life is dangerous. I am getting tired of being disturbed on a deep level that inside me you will find organs and tissue and blood, etc., and im sure people are getting tired of me saying this kind of stuff. Move on right? I know its just a fact of life we all know and have to deal with. But i just cannot wrap my mind around the idea of living things. Anyway, that aside, i wish these images and dream states would cease. They feel so real. As a side note: i just want to apologize fo

174375925,"What type of med do you need three times a day? I take meds three times a day but when I wake up, after dinner and before bed. So I can get through most of the day without them. I used to take them four times a day. I took Wellbutrin in the morning and in the afternoon so I used to have to take an afternoon dose but I asked for the XL. I think it stands for extended release and that one lasts all day. Maybe you can ask for it. I don’t know why they just didn’t give me that to begin with. It was stupid. I took 150 mg in the morning and then another 150 mg in the afternoon. Now I just take one 300xl in the morning. Same effects. If I go visit family for dinner I take my after dinner meds with me in a ziplock bag in my back pocket. My wife says if I get stopped by the police I will get arrested. You are supposed to carry the prescription bottle. That’s too much trouble. I work now and I bring my backpack with me to and from work and I do keep three prescription bottles in there. Geodon, Wellbutr
in and Xanax. Those are my emergency meds. You can never be too careful. I had negative symptoms before I started antipsychotics though. I definitely do sleep much more now. A lot more. But I don’t nap. I can make it all day long just fine. But when it gets dark I want to go to bed."

176132830,"My psychiatrists over the years would very much disagree with you. Have you ever heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional ? It’s poor thinking to say that real intelligence is being good in all domains. Whereas most have a VIQ-PIQ gap that’s < 10 there’s a small amount that have a gap significantly larger than that. In other words they have a spiky profile. That indicates, to use American terminology, the strong probability of a learning disability as opposed to an intellectual disability.

I lost my mother in an accident in 2016, my father gave up, had strokes, and is now in a nursing home unable to function, and I lost my gf I was planning on living the rest of my life with among other various problems. After I kicked her out for hearing her talk on her phone telling someone how much she hates me every night, I believe her and a neighbor I wronged have messed with me for 7 months. Torturing me, saying they were going to kill me, making sounds of them having sex, teasing me, putting cameras and mics in my house to mess with me… etc.etc. etc. Now I think they can read my thoughts and others have joined in there torture. Daily they mess with me all day. they have said things ive been doing alone outloud, and they had to have cameras here to know what I was doing. embarrassing things. I have no private thoughts as I believe they hear what I hear and see what I see. I am unsure if I have snapped or if this is really happening. 
I am tortured. they other day I believed they had me hooked up remotely to a polygraph and they played a torturous noise that made me ram my head against a wall and try to pop it to stop. I also could not control my thoughts and mean things were going through my brain that I didn’t believe and hurt theyre feelings and they tortured me more for it. In order to stop the thoughts, I burnt my arm to focus on the pain to make them stop, I could not stop or control them and didn’t want to hurt anyone. I was also lacking sleep at that time for a couple days, so im unaware if I hallucinated it or this is really occurring. I realize how bad this sounds but I am really at the end of my rope here and can not put up any further with this. I do not know what to do or what doctors to go see!!

176132854,"The very word ‘mystic’ seems to mean something like ‘one who closes, as in closing his eyes or mouth’ to keep a secret. So, mystics would seem to keep secrets. If they have some secret for navigating psychosis, I may not know it (_USER_ID_: unless it is somewhere in my body of spiritual knowledge) Since _NAME_ seems to have studied many different cultures, maybe he was referring to cultures in which psychotic people were allowed to experience and recover from their psychosis without medication, and eventually recovered somewhat with what is considered by some in that culture to be enhanced spiritual insight. I think that the difficulty with that model in an affluent, modern, western culture is that if people are allowed to wander around psychotic, they are considered to be (and often are) interfering with the smooth operation of the big machine. They frequently have very counterproductive encounters with police, or they may operate or interact with heavy machinery such as cars or trains in 
very dangerous ways. So, I don’t see how a modern, affluent western society could apply the wandering mystic recovery model to psychosis, as it seems to have been used in some other cultures."

I can’t quite say I’m grateful for the experience but I think the insights gleaned from it granted me a better understanding of how to not let myself get to the point of total collapse again."

Maybe I will need a sleepmed on the side if I’m gonna try out abilify? I used to be able to sleep when skipping a dose, but after long term use(over 10 years) it seems the drugs may have impaired my brain, and now I’m unable to sleep without zyprexa.

174375934,"Hi. I’ve been having delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations for about the last 11 years. I’ve tried Abilify, Risperdal, Vraylar, Geodon, and am currently on Zyprexa (10 mg) and Invega Sustenna (234 mg every 3 weeks). I consider myself treatment-resistant. I’m wanting to try Clozapine if my doctor thinks it’s a good idea. Anyone have any experiences to share or thoughts on the matter? Thank you. Just to be clear, I’m aware that it has a nasty side effect profile and that for the first few months on it you need to get blood work done."
176132868,I didn’t think it was that common
176132869,"What are you delusional about even though you don’t think you are, if you don’t mind me asking? Never mind, I found in different posts. I feel you paranoid about computers is fake because when I was on adderall I thought the same thing. I know my adderall psychosis was fake. But I worry about other things not really related to it now."

176132872,"I remember that part in “The Beauty and the Beast” where _NAME_’s father is taken in to some sort of custody because the town dubbed him insane. It was a really traumatizing scene. When I was in middle school I still believed someone like that would come and get me if I told what was going on in my brain. So, yes."
176132873,"Almost immediately I stopped having such intense side effects. However, a couple weeks later I did notice my symptoms go up."
176132874,Yes more so after having sz. I need more now to feel pleasure and its still much less than the pleasure before sz.
176132875,"Even most religious people don’t believe there are demons inside the people around him. You follow that up with thinking your mentor is leading you astray based on the devils influence and it’s not normal, even for a religious person. I use to believe weird stuff like that when I was psychotic too. I use to think the devil and angels could control people and have them talk to me. But it’s not real. You are in denial."

People who play with each other and respond to the GODS, matrix style?? POLL?? Lions kill in the name of god. Dogs bite and control. Bears kill in the name of GOD. SO does crocodiles. Komododragons dont, never move. Birds have families. Rhinos and elephantys are violent. Horses like to perform. Small cats have fun. This is their interpretation of GOD.

Found one that is caring, has worked with my meds, and genuinely cares about my symptoms such as anxiety and depression. It becomes easier when I found a Doc that clicked with me"
176132886,yes I have insurance
174375926,I became friends with my ex gf via Facebook. Back then I was not a schizophrenic. (now -we still talk sometimes- she is afraid of me. What if you murder me if I come there? She asks). Back then I was quite interesting and very thin and cool. With Facebook I have made many real life friends

176132889,CSGO I got into for a few months. Fun stuff. I take Haldol 2 mg and Paliperidone 3 mg PRN.
174375931,"I don’t at all. For one thing not every schizophrenic is severely affected enough to require meds or even as many meds as they may be prescribed. Hey if you don’t absolutely need that crap you definitely shouldn’t take it. My measure on that is ""Can you function in society without the meds? Then don’t take them. But if you can’t then by all means take your meds. But if the meds don’t help one iota take something else. And if you go through the A-Z med catalog and nothing helps find a way to live with the voices and throw that crap away."
174375927,"_AT_MENTION_, I have sza and I have cognitive impairment that my pdoc said was from sz. And I also suffer from some rather severe negative symptoms as well: social withdrawal and isolation, apathy and flat affect. Besides, we really shouldn’t be arguing about who’s diagnosis is worse. They are all bad."
174375929,"Yeah, days of bad brain inflammation. I ate bread a few days back and the pressure was so bad I was slamming doors and clattering dishes. Was so pissed off at my hallucinations. Comparatively, today is relatively calm. Try going gluten-free for a few days. Replace bread with something else, like potatoes or rice. It’ll make a huge difference. Gluten sensitivity is a big factor in schizophrenia. Schizophrenics have 10x the diagnosed celiac disease that the general public does. That’s diagnosed, just imagine the undiagnosed, sub-clinical risk. Celiac disease is worsened by low vitamin D3 levels, and at least 40% of the populace suffers from this. People barely get any sun these days."
176132890,"idk. but i have heard more than once that coming off antipsychotics cold turkey can lead to intense headaches,just saying, as a precaution"

176132892,Are you having any other symptoms?
176132893,When I wake up I feel like I’m being mentally tortured for a few hours. If I’m lucky that feeling goes away and if I’m not then it doesn’t.

174375941,Congratulations!

176132904,"Now everytime I have an attack, I feel the urge to come here and tell someone. Gah!! It’s happening again! I feel frustrated and angry which actually means I’m recovering some because before I had zero emotions but fear. Even that wasn’t that bad. Now the paranoia is painful. I’m frustrated and angry because I just want to be normal. Obviously, I don’t want to be in pain with every action a constant battle. Stupid words set me off. I’m tired of this. And it happens so quick. One minute I’m fine, the next I’m in disabling fear. One minute I’m having normal conversation. The next minute I’m hearing stuff. I just want to not live on edge all the time. I take meds but I’m skeptical that they are helping me at all at this point. I’ll keep taking them, I just don’t really see them as working. Nothing works. I keep trying tho. You guys are my wrap around now. I appreciate it."
176132905,"We don’t. If we are to understand _PERSON_’ “I think therefore I am” as “my thoughts are truly my thoughts, therefore I am” we immediately run into some serious difficulties as pointed out by quite a few philosophers. At a personal level I’ve struggled at times to trust ownership of my own thoughts. Once at hospital I thought I’d been replaced by an identical copy of myself, endlessly seeking for clues in my own thinking as to my real identity."

176132907,What is your New Year’s resolution? I’d like to hear it.
176132908,"Xanax 1mg twice a day. Prn an extra 0.5mg, if I run out of 0.5mg she’ll write me for more right away. But we’ve found since not on an AP or AD right now, the anxiety has been bad, and she said I shoulda been on these for years while rotating thru meds like candy. Maybe end of March I can cut down, we’ll see. But gotta wait for the new drug to be available."

176132910,_AT_MENTION_ I have hypothyroidism and am on 125 mmg but my thyroid is over active with my meds so I’m not so sure what’s going on (my thyroid was partly killed from age 14-16 and shouldn’t really be able to come up again so knowing it’s over acting is concerning) I’ve gained weight from age 15 on I started at 110 lbs and was size 5 and loved it maybe I’ll get to that point again I can only hope
176132911,"I get like that often. Now, I can see they are good, then I get negative and stop taking them. Think I don’t need them until the devil unleashes, and then I lose total insight. The last time I went off my AP was in October, then I got on an injection. Probably 2-3 x a month I think about stopping it then I come on here and people convince me otherwise. I’m glad I have people on here with similar experiences and can talk me out of it. The brain damage thing scares me but then I start thinking I don’t have sz, so I wouldn’t get damage"

Had a couple of years in the sun but had to leave for various reasons… I always had excuses for why I went through life but I’d never understood paranoia. That is so insidious when it runs your life. It affects every single thought or thing you do… It’s good to be angry. Any emotion is good but allow yourself some good ones too. I think you lost a friend in your home? Why not try and make another one. Friends really do make it easier to take yourself out of your headspace. That isn’t a bad thing.

174375947,Hi welcome to the forums. It’s a tough thing early but we’ve all been there. If you have schizophrenia then early intervention with the appropriate medications leads to better outcomes. It’s not a bad thing and if you need it the meds work for most. Just stay cool and take the pills they give you. They aren’t anything sinister. They help most folks on this website.

You’ll never be able to prove it true or false, so you either believe it or you don’t. We say other religious people are delusional when their beliefs start to negatively impact their life. For example, if they start treating others badly because of their faith, or if they stop making decisions entirely because they believe they have no free will. You are free to continue believing we are in a simulation. That isn’t an issue. The issue is the way you let it interfere with your sense of peace and happiness."

And strangely enough it’s usually my right peripheral vision, almost like there’s something wrong with my eyes, but I’ve had them checked because of it, and everything was fine supposedly. So idk. I don’t know the difference between illusions and hallucinations, the definition of illusion says something about the way you perceive things and hallucinations is seeing things that aren’t there.

176132986,"Well on Latuda was the best out of those but I had paranoia especially when watching the news. I was also freezing during the day like mild catatonia. I think Latuda 120mg is too weak for me. Well I will still try Vraylar, my parents and brothers will control my behavior if anything goes wrong."
174375961,"It is a process to stabilize on any new medicine, esp APs in my experience. Trial and error you know. Stick with it and you can and will find the right one. I felt positive and negative symptom free after about 2 weeks on the oral pill form of Abilify. It was sort of a gradual decrease of symptoms, but pretty fast luckily. It has been about a year since I started this med. No hospitalizations or clinical worsening has happened since. I’ve kept a steady employment the whole time. I get a raise on my hire date anniversary! I hope and pray things continue this way. Just keep taking your meds as prescribed. And keep in good communication with your healthcare team. They are there for you"
176132987,"God no. Part of me can’t understand the point of marriage. Feels too much like fantasy and not based on real love. It’s more about the appearance of how people think things should be. Besides, I’m gay and can’t really even fully embrace that. Being seen that way by my family makes me wince internally."
176132988,I got flagged for the same thing.
174375960,"I’m on clozapine as well, it is a very good med. Your blood work should be done the same day that it’s taken. Get ready for drooling and drowsy feeling. It is also a good idea to get some miralax just in case you get constipation."
176132989,I don’t but I don’t harm anyone the state treats me like ???? anyways so they can go ???? themselves
176132990,All the psychosis I had since 21 years old and I’m 33… I would be just like simple _NAME_ look him up on YouTube…wut I’m saying is I had allloooottt
176132991,"I was thinking more of _NAME_ or _PERSON_. Pronounced ""Brfxxccxxmnpcccc- lllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116."
176132992,I eat 2 -3 serving of mushroom a week so I feel I get my mushroom fix that way. Besides it’s a little expensive . . .
176132993,Out of Luck Well so far I’ve never done what you told me to But baby i want you I’d follow you all the way to the Sun I look back on all the days that I’ve done you wrong Can’t we just get along So sorry for all the things I’ve become You don’t have to say it…cause i already know… (Chorus) I smoke too much. I drink too much I lie too much. I cheat too much. I love ya too much…I love ya too much. Ooh yeah! I’m on the street I’m out of luck. I think back through all those years that you stood by me But I will never be The leading man who wins your heart So all i can do is hope that you won’t leave me Standing all alone Finding a place to make a new start You don’t have to say it…cause i already know… (Chorus) (Solo) (Fade)
176132994,"The last thing that helped was Seroquel, but it stopped working. I was actually content on that med. Now on Invega I feel horrible again. I feel like I’m coming in and out of it."
176132995,"I’ve been hospitalized 10 times. I’ve never had a hospitalization where when I got out, I said, “Wow, that was a good hospitalization, that really helped.” I look at them as necessary evils, only to go in as last resorts. They might help a lot of other people though."
176132996,The news said that this virus is the worst public health hazard in living memory.
176132997,Watching movies taking it slow n easy right now it’s black mass the movie
174375965,I worked in administratrion september/October but had to quit due to symptoms. As for now it’s just impossible for me to work (even part-time). I take Invega and clozapine.
176132998,"Try to get your health back, this is the biggest favor to humanity,"
176132999,"It actually was one of the names my parents were deciding to name me as, it did not become my name however."
176133000,"I like my current therapist. Her cultural upbringing was way different from mine, being that she was raised in Asia and I’ve never left the US, but I actually like that because I think it’s helping me become more open-minded. She’s very chill but stern when needed (though never in a mean way) and we share a similar sense of humor. I’m pretty satisfied so far. I’ve actually liked all four of the therapists I’ve seen to this point. I do wish I’d tried harder at therapy when I first started going but I was so demoralized from psychosis that I didn’t see the point of trying at anything, even something potentially good for me. Oh well, I can only ever do something about the present moment."
176133001,My boyfriend helps me forget. When I’m with him on dates and just hanging out and things he makes me forget all of my mental illness. I’m just a normal girl in a happy relationship doing normal relationship things. It is an amazing feeling.

176133005,"I’d have an easier time taking them if the voices didn’t want me to take them. They say they are trying to get rid of me. I’m trying to get past that and take them, though."
174375973,I think I will order some more and take more this time.
176133006,I’m scared to spend money because I’m scared to run short especially with Christmas gifts etc. I need to order the Amazon stuff soon. I guess I could hold off on paying the hydro until January.
174375966,I havent tried clozapine but have tried a few others risperidone abilify amisulpride
176133007,"Wow, thanks for your share. How has the underlying emotions and cognition been over the year since that?"
176133008,"Silent Beauty, An Exploration Defining Genuine Constellations Inside of Our Auras Sincerely, DJ _PERSON_ Bat Beam (sleepoptimistic)"
176133009,I honestly don’t remember if it’s ssdi or ssi. It’s whatever one pays more. I’d love to work again but stress and me just don’t get along. I don’t see me getting a job anytime soon
176133010,Thanks for your advice I appreciate it.
