176082769,"Hi when I first got sick it was in 2014. The dog bite was in 2009, and I had my thyroid removed in 2012. I will say one thing, I noticed a change in my health gradually deteriorating from around 2013, onwards. Whether it‚Äôs got to do with removal of my thyroid. I had a benign adenoma. Did have some radioactive iodine as well way back before dog bite. In 2014, I started to have morning headaches that lasted most of the day. I started falling to my right side, and felt disoriented. I just wasn‚Äôt myself. Tests showed an increase in lesions in the right frontal lobe but no MS. That‚Äôs what I was tested for. Lumbar puncture clear. It‚Äôs a long and complicated story but all neurologists said no MS and no other structural damage can be seen on MRI. I do have a narrowing of C5 and C6. Surgery was planned for this, but my neurologist decided to tell the spinal surgeon to not go ahead with surgery. To this day I do not know why this happened. The same neurologist said my prognosis was good, but he didn‚
Äôt elaborate further. I‚Äôm always dizzy and falling forwards now so I dont know why I feel like this other than the increase in lesions perhaps? All is stable with no progression. Apparently neurologists see this kind of thing every day and I have seen several neurologists who say this is common. I smoke a bit, so that probably doesn‚Äôt help:( My friend thinks since the dog bite she noticed I wasn‚Äôt myself because she said the shock affected me. I myself cant relate my illness to the dog bite. I think the headaches were a sign something was happening, because for seconds upon awakening I could feel nothing but could see. Thankfully that‚Äôs all stopped. I swell in the heat, and need cold to help the pain in my arms and legs. The heat drains me the last few years. I‚Äôve extreme fatigue as well. My diagnosis for my physical symptoms is somataform disorder. I have anxiety and depression too. My psychiatrist said I am bordering on being delusional because I believe I have MS, it‚Äôs all just not making sens
e. I feel like theres a concrete block in my head every day and I hate the unbalance. My head feels woozy and drunken feeling. Thanks for your insight. I do though have unwanted thoughts and was really badly depressed up until recently when my meds were changed. Two years I did nothing only sleep most of the time. I was really bad so much so I snapped and went and got help. Now I‚Äôm in a better place thankfully. What do you think of the meds I am taking Lyrica 300mg daily Quietapine 300mg Seroquel 10mg Effexor 225mg Eltroxin 150mcg 5 days a week Eltroxin 175mcg 2 days a week Betmiga 50mg daily. I think the psychiatrist is thinking I have more than somataform disorder because of the meds. I dont think these meds are for somataform disorder but maybe are for depression and anxiety? Sorry about such a long post, but my story could take hours to write, if I were to go into all the details and reports!"

When I decided to really give it all I had, in the beginning, that resulted in just being even more tired after trying to force my body to do something it wouldn‚Äôt do, while still doing nothing at all. Eventually I overcame it. Maybe the relief of sometimes being able to do something did something to my brain. Maybe it was something completely different. I don‚Äôt know. But it eventually worked."

174363073,"_AT_MENTION_ I can understand your feelings of persecution & grandeur. It is not healthy to entertain delusions as they are self-destructive but, like most delusions, they are originally based in reality before they get bigger & out of touch with reality. Undergrad & post grad Physics is a big deal - Wow! Well done. I qualified as an architect in my youth & physics was a component of that. Although good at maths, I found comprehension of physics elusive. Physics describes the structure of the universe and it is great that you are a master of it. Be proud. But you have to get along with people in a reasonable manner too. I taught undergrad architecture students & that role did give a sense of power & authority - moulding young minds, hopefully for the better & in a morally upright manner, helping them to make the world a better place. But I was also talking to myself in the stairwells when alone, quite psychotic. And very unhappy, lonely & tormented. I feel persecuted after lots of social interactio
ns. I feel offended, misunderstood, overlooked, under-valued, unjustly blamed. Some of that may be real but most of it is paranoia and my over-reaction to social situations. Over-reactions are just that, not real. I have struggled with workplace relationships- with colleagues and managers - for the last 20 years. These days I work casual shifts so my managers & colleagues change every shift. That way I can‚Äôt get deluded about this relationship or that interaction because next shift, it‚Äôs different staff & different expectations. If you are able to work part time or full time permanent that is a great strength. I find ap‚Äôs very helpful. Have you got a pdoc & meds?"

174363102,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Patients With Idiopathic Scoliosis Run an Increased Risk of Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Spine deformity, Mar 2019 Retrospective cohort study.To investigate a possible linkage between idiopathic scoliosis (IS) and schizophrenia in an adolescent population. There is an interesting link between schizophrenia and idiopathic scoliosis: schizophrenia is a disturbance of mental equilibrium, and scoliosis of physical equilibrium, both are multifactorial, genetically determined, start at a young age, and brain development is thought to play a role. Furthermore, both may be presenting symptoms of the genetic disorder 22q11 deletion syndrome. This study poses the question whether these two poorly understood disorders are related.A retrospective cohort study was conducted and consisted of 3,702 Swedish adolescents, collected from the National Patient Register, that underwent inpatient care for IS during 1997-2015. These were matched by age, sex, and date 
of diagnosis to 370,200 controls, collected from Swedish population data, and then followed up in the National Patient Register to identify in- and outpatient care for schizophrenia diagnosis. Follow-up time was calculated from first IS diagnosis date until date of schizophrenia diagnosis or end of follow-up. _PERSON_ proportional regression analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for being diagnosed with schizophrenia.Over a median follow-up time of 9.5 years, 0.7% of patients with IS developed schizophrenia versus 0.5% of controls (p = .04). The risk of schizophrenia was significantly higher in patients with IS (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.23). Using only hospitalized schizophrenia as event, the prevalence for schizophrenia was 0.5% versus 0.3% (p ?.01; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.84).This study suggests that patients with IS have increased risk of schizophrenia. Dissatisfaction with one's physical appearance might lead to psychological distress and provoke menta
l illness in predisposed persons. Alternatively, these two disorders may share a common genetic background.Level 2B."

But as to voices, I would believe them and reach out to people and say what they said, now I don‚Äôt entertain them and they get quieter to non existant.

176083101,I‚Äôm sorry you are down. Hope you can find things to do to beat the feeling of depression. Recently I felt depressed either. One of my Chinese Sz friends told me an increase of the dose of antipsychotics could help with depression. So I am going to raise my Olanzapine by 2.5mg.
176083102,Yes my voices have done this. They told me what was gonna be on the tv in five second delays again and again and again. I can‚Äôt believe no one finds that interesting or shocking

174363157,"A few years ago I told my family that I was worried gang members would come to the door looking for me. I thought they knew what kind of _NAME_ I was driving and could come bursting in at any moment. My family believed me and told me not to come around anymore. I‚Äôve been stable for a year now and struggling with the thought. Is it better for them to believe I‚Äôm part of this ‚Äúpretend‚Äù gang or is it better for them to know I have schizophrenia? I really don‚Äôt want them to know that I have it, but really what choice do I have at this point. So far, I‚Äôve just been avoiding them. Probably, not the best way to handle it."

176083136,Dont like my voices much but they have given me crazy delusions about being god now they tell me that iam not and iam the most weakest worthless being. They say that iam the weakest being out of endless beings in the universe and cant quit smoking cuz iam week it‚Äôs hard to go a day without the smoking. I know it‚Äôs not true cuz there is an endless amount of galaxies out there and there has to me one being more weaker than me

176083153,"thank you, i agree, and generally speaking an obsessive engagment in one‚Äôs disabeling limitations can only cause more harm than good, and that is the mainthing. in the past i found some articles with information on how to improve semantic encoding, but i haven‚Äôt tried it yet because it seems like hard work. it‚Äôs on google. i don‚Äôt remember where i found it, but look for ways to improve semantic memory if you wish. this is my seconed psychotic brake, and i know that with some hard rehabilitation i was able to get better after my first brake. i have a problem with cumulative SM (knowledge that i have accumilated prior to my seconed psychotic attack), and i have difficulties to remember new accumilated information, but to a lesser degree. it‚Äôs also like i don‚Äôt have a mental notepad. i found that repetition helps me as well, but whats bother me the most is not being able to remember concepts that involves emotions (the way you feel regarding stuff, like the way you feel towards meaningful 
stuff, like birth/death/marrige/dogs etc‚Äô). occasionally i can remember a feeling, but it doesn‚Äôt last and i forget it. it makes it very hard to participate life this way."

176083158,I love it! Great job!
176083159,Why am I troubled in your opinion
176083160,I don‚Äôt think so actually. Hopefully kids will only be smoking if they‚Äôre 21+ because that‚Äôs what the law will be restricting to. Right now dealers will sell to any age. With legality only 21+ W/ ID. Always gonna be flaws. But same w/ a much worse substance alcohol. I used to not be able to smoke at all. But now My parents and even my pdoc say it‚Äôs ok for me. It was actually like ‚Äúyou must not be smoking marijuana anymore‚Äù and I said ‚Äúactually‚Ä¶its saved my life‚Äù. And then I started talking really fast about all the things it did to help me and he said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs helping you‚Ä¶‚Äù. Now we don‚Äôt talk about it anymore

I don‚Äôt know what its all about, but I try to remain calm through it. The more I‚Äôve attempted to stop the motions the more pronounced they get. Nowadays, I go somewhere private, so I don‚Äôt freak people out. Then I just let them do what they are going to do. They stop quickly when I‚Äôm not obsessing over it."

176083174,"Hey. Lately I‚Äôve suffered a pretty horrible relapse of psychotic symptoms, I was recently put on a new medication (Fanapt) but it hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet. I‚Äôm basically unable to function for most of the day, I ended up going to my grandmas yesterday because on my own in my apartment I wasn‚Äôt eating and barely sleeping. So, I‚Äôm wondering if this is bad enough I need to go inpatient. I really hate going into the hospital, it‚Äôs boring and anxiety inducing and they always end up putting me on high doses of an AP with a lot of side effects, but I‚Äôm wondering if I might need this. Or maybe something like Partial Hospital. Thoughts?"

176083182,Yus thankyou i watched it i am not like him. I will post pictures later on for you _AT_MENTION_. As for the base i modified it more by using a piece of double sided 3M adhesive mounting tape and a bit of another dinner _NAME_ cut out to a tiny square to give a base for support at the back. So there is no wobble as the original came Believe me you dont want to lift that thing all day long back and forth. Sliding is better

176083186,Also seeing a therapist could help

176083222,"I‚Äôm trying to get in shape. I lift weights, I never did before, I watch fitness channels on youtube, I took notes and learned how to lift weights‚Ä¶still its hard for me! I hurt my foot at the fitness center. I hurt my knee deadlifting on my weakened leg. I had a lot of energy with mania so I started channeling it into exercise. I found jogging easy to do, and the motivation was there all of a sudden. _AT_MENTION_ also said it was a good way to use up some energy. I bought some cheap equipment on amazon. A new hex bar and bumper plates, I deadlift in the garage. I do bent over rows. The farmers walk is a great full body exercise. I had a doorway pullup bar left over sitting around‚Ä¶It‚Äôs been here since 2009 (I was 12! ) and is somewhat neglected, but in perfect condition. I use it for over head pulling and hanging exercises. I bought an adjustable weight bench, which I use for seated exercises. I bought 2 sets of powerblock adjustable dumbells 24lb and 50lb weight limit. They help for upper bo
dy exercises, I also found I can set them on the floor and hold them when I do pushups. If I can get up the courage, I‚Äôll try squatting , bench pressing, and overhead pressing at the gym. A quality barbell is expensive! On the lowest set of handles, I feel the hex bar allows some stretching. Still, I feel the bench press is an innessential exercise compared to the squat. I also am unlikely to be able to get a spotter or a cage for each exercise. Still, those might be future investments, and amazon ships free. I might even (if my mom helps me out on money) just keep them in the packaging, unassembled. My mom also bought a treadmill a long time ago‚Ä¶nobody else uses it. A cable machine is another thing I want to buy for the home gym. Jogging and running are my main exercises, even when I was on meds I jogged with a strict schedule. _AT_MENTION_ inspired me to keep a schedule. _AT_MENTION_ inspired me to try and put together a home gym. _AT_MENTION_ inspired me to try to exercise and buy equipment, too. _NAME
_‚Äôs athleanx youtube channel was my main source for tips on how to do the exercises. I sat down and took notes, or even watched the videos while I was doing the exercises. One of the things I like about physical activity is that its an option when mantally unwell, as long as I have motivation, and it breaks up the monotony. It is mindless and primal, it allows me to activate my muscles without mental energy. -aerobic exercise is good for cognition -lifting weight improves body composition (triggers release of testosterone, hgh) and those hormones as well as others are great for fat loss, quality sleep, mental sharpness, healing, bone health, and body composition) -if you are ravenous on atypicals, those calories help you grow -i believe it is impossible to lose weight on antipsychotics‚Äîthe better option i think is to put muscle under the fat -it makes you smarter! -it increases bone density (An issue on mood stabilizers) -Remember to drink water! Aps can make you get hot and sweat -lifting weights with a 
focus on hypertrophy (bodybuilding) is not taxing to the central nervous system -lifting weights necessitates a quality diet -jogging or running helps you get outside and in the sun -listening to music or podcasts is fun -it gives your day structure -it builds self esteem, you feel like a champion -it taxes the central nrevous system, and its good to feel that ‚Äúshock‚Äù, esp, i feel, when on meds -I do it for myself, there‚Äôs no judgement, I don‚Äôt need to be seen or critiqued In the future, I wanna invest in other things -expansions for the powerblock dumbells -a cable machine -first and foremost‚Ä¶bands to improve some of my joint issues -when my foot gets better, I want to jog again -my jogs are long and slow, up to 7 miles or rarely 10 at the most, but usually around 2-4 TL;DR; Main Point: What are your strategies for staying in shape?"
174363185,Fortunately I 'm a teacher but it is with great difficulty that I perform my lectures. When students are silent I find it hard to overcome the delusion of persecution.

176083231,"So it‚Äôs been over a month since I‚Äôve thought about my triggers and I‚Äôve returned to politics and aliens. Why? I know there are infinite time streams in which all realities take place, I know there is infinite life, I know there is infinite suffering and joy, so why did I choose to return to something so enormous as the earth and its place in the universe. Boredom? We are all equally powerful in that we have the power to live our lives our own way, but why we do things is a mystery, from pre-eternity to eternity, indeed beyond time and space even, which themselves are constructs. Yes it was boredom, and fear of failure. I have set myself some targets, some small, some bigger, but nothing as big as this for while now, and it is a trigger because I can‚Äôt engage with it from the perspective of me being a nobody without extreme paranoia. Or rather from the perspective not of a nobody but of who I am. Boredom and fear of failure can drive one to search for ever more unrealistic realities. I want 
to stay grounded in my bubble of comfort, slowly working myself into a better person, but I have feared failing at this and have got bored with the work. I want to return to focusing on my routine and my life with friends and family. I can do this, I have done it before. Thank you."

It‚Äôs a move made on the other side of the tennis court, so no use in stressing about it. I recommend being yourself if you want a serious relationship. Stay confident and forget about things that is for the other person to decide. If you just want to meet someone for the short haul you could always do a act. I remember many years ago I played a character that was superconfident and a roomstealer at a party. So a girl wanted to come home with me.

176083411,"Is it catatonia instead? I previously thought it was OCD but now realizing its due to catatonia. The difference is very important. The conventional drugs used for OCD like SSRI and other serotonin drugs worsens the OCD if its due to catatonia. The mechanism is like this. Serotonin opposes dopamine. Dopamine lowering result in poor working memory which makes it hard to carry multiple information at same time. If its due to catatonia then its due to low dopamine in certain part in the brain especially prefrontal cortex the area linked to executive function, working memory etc. To reduce this kind of OCD need to improve dopamine function. AP lowers dopamine so taking some AP can worsen this kind of OCD."

They always comment or argue about whatever I‚Äôm thinking about and even have pre made phrases to say on words I‚Äôm thinking as a cue. The voices each have a personality but the brain creates people with personalities when dreaming, so maybe it‚Äôs possible when awake.

174363284,"I think the government AND aliens gave me insanity (common nomenclature is treatment resistant schizoaffective disorder depressive type). Not sure why. I‚Äôm a normal American citizen and civilian Always have been. I was a normal Libertarian college student at a prestigious university back in 2011. I got psychosis from susbstance induced psychosis back then. I recovered and then got extremely sick again and never recovered. I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm coming back alive after I die again and again like a movie. Like groundhog day with schizophrenia starting around 2013 at the latest. Im not sure at the exact timing. I was a time traveler and researcher in a past life and scientist and writer among other things. There‚Äôs no proof or evidence though at all. Im not alone. Never figured out why. They told me several things in my past lives. Even now, I get the fake news on my phone when https is removed like tomcat‚Ä¶ I had one netflix add last night that was on pandora and it scared the living hell out of m
e. Theres no proof just coincidence after coincidence. Despite the failings of the government at the macro level and daily life (including politics), these guys doing it are extremely sneaky, smart, and have technology so advanced it doesn‚Äôt exist. I believe in aliens but sometimes they do the whole fake alien thing. You never know if its really military or just some alien race that is extremely advanced. I think the government has the chance and ability to help cure my schizophrenia some day. I have hope. It would make me believe and feel better about government and life and reality in general. I‚Äôm convinced I worked for aliens and some government stuff in a past life or even on a parallel planet like this one called Earth. I could go on, but i get paranoid.

Similar to a time loop Im stuck in but I have a difficult time remembering due to multiple mind wipes. Closest thing I ever had was thinking about jokin
g ROTC in college but didn‚Äôt. I was in jrotc in high school. Step father and father were in military. Grandfather was a high level freemason. No one believes me of course. I like these threads because I‚Äôm not alone. My story is hard to grasp even for me. My parents don‚Äôt believe it and I never got any help or support. People rarely if ever empathize with me and are tired of hearing me talk about my trauma. People moved on. I was in mk ultra, monarch, montauk, secret space program, and a super soldier, and in the illuminati if you count past lives. I believe I was tortured and taken and let go in this life similar to monarch programming or montauk or secret space program. There is no evidence because they used time travel to cover it up. I‚Äôm convinced because no one has talked, admitted it, or seen anything, but i have real memories. Furthermore, I dont want or expect compensation or empathy anymore. Aliens could have been involved but im shocked that it could have been rich illuminati type people work
ing with the military. I‚Äôve been stuck in this time loop and I dont know why. Perhaps I missed my exit point in a past life or its a form of punishment. I worry about my safety and my family‚Äôs safety above anything else. I‚Äôm more into YouTube these days to get my story out instead of posting here every day. I might post more now that im here.

I spent seven years (damn!) of my life trying to find a spiritual meaning for life and squeeze it out of every drop of existence. Those were seven years of time I could‚Äôve been mastering life. I didn‚Äôt master life. I didn‚Äôt find lasting meaning. I was a spiritual junkie. I just went in circles like a dog chasing his tail, and found many people who are willing to tell you anything about yourself and your place in the universe if it‚Äôll earn them money/prestige. It all went back to my ego, and was never about an interdependent worldview that can actually create feelings of being worthwhile and purposeful. If there is meaning, it is in our connection as human beings, not out in the stars, but here, right now. Being married and constantly around someone else, although it is not without its challenges, has given me deeper insight into the meaning that humans can have when we affect each other. We can create a world w
here we truly give each other a really rad experience, or one that‚Äôs hell, and that is where the meaning comes in. The times in my life where I have felt the most meaning and purpose for being alive have been with someone else, engaged in love and connection, when I am giving back and accepting love. In my experience, the more we search for meaning, the more life just passes us by. I never found an answer but I‚Äôm better than I was then, even though I feel less bliss and spiritual awe than I did then, because I‚Äôm less confused and lost. I feel more satisfied with day do day existence even though I never found out the Big Meaning of It All."

176083756,"When I finally stabilized and came back down to reality I got hit with a pretty severe depression and hadn‚Äôt felt like this ever before. I was literally just existing, no energy, feeling exhausted, sleeping a lot, barely eating, low mood and motivation to do nothing. I was working at the time so that was forcing me to get out of bed because I wanted to be a responsible employee. I wasn‚Äôt happy with my life but I was glad I had survived such a scary part of the illness and came close to dying. I wasn‚Äôt delusional anymore. I pushed through with all this for a good month until I told my psychiatrist how I was feeling. She put on Wellbutrin started me off with a low dose and then eventually had to increase. My motivation, energy, mood everything started to lift. I was taking 200mg at the highest dose and was feeling great but it was keeping my brain a little too active and was having racing thoughts all the time but I was stable and dealing with it. I eventually slowly started to taper down and w
as steady and stable on 50mg per day and told my psychiatrist as well. I had been doing pretty good on that dose and was hoping that I wouldn‚Äôt need it anymore but didn‚Äôt stop taking the medication. Recently I‚Äôve been slipping into my depression again. Don‚Äôt feel like getting out of bed and it seems that the exhaustion I was feeling is starting to return with the low mood and I‚Äôve been sleeping too much as well. I‚Äôve been taking Wellbutrin for more than a year now and was hoping that the depression would have lifted by now but it seems like its still lingering in the background. Why am I depressed? I try to be grateful for everything and am happy with a lot of things but this depression doesn‚Äôt seem like it going away. Any advice would be helpful."

176083802,"When I was young I hated my dad, but he did a lot to atone for the misery he inflicted. Just from hearing about my dad a person wouldn‚Äôt think I was abused, but if a person experienced my dad‚Äôs behavior they would understand. I was molested by an eighteen year old when I was four. My dad also could not resist his impulse to have sex with little boys. He was helpless to fight against it. When I was fifteen my dad started hanging out with little boys and bringing them around our house. It really messed with my head. Also, my dad was always overwhelmingly, weirdly affectionate with me and my older brother. It felt creepy as hell. I saw my niece and my nephew rebel against my dad‚Äôs behavior, but they saw him little enough that they weren‚Äôt damaged by it. But my dad did pay for a year of psychiatric care in a private psychiatric hospital out of our family‚Äôs savings. He also did a lot of stuff like getting me a degree of Indian blood card and a burial policy life insurance. If it wasn‚Äôt for t
hat life insurance policy I would probably be buried in a totally obscure place. My family turned against my dad, though. My sister found a very nice nursing home where he could be watched, and from there my entire family ignored him. I remember one Christmas we were probably about twenty-five miles away from the nursing home my sister got my dad, and I was saying we should go and visit our father. My sister said she just couldn‚Äôt deal with seeing him, and she refused to talk about it. That must have felt pretty rotten to my dad, to know we were only a short distance away from him, and we wouldn‚Äôt go see him. There was no way I could have gotten my dad to stop being so weirdly affectionate. One time my dad said in family therapy, ‚ÄúI could not see how any kid would not want to be love and affection, a kid not getting all the loving he could get, I wouldn‚Äôt understand that.‚Äù I really hated my dad when I was growing up, but after I got older I felt pity and love for him. I‚Äôm convinced he could have b
een a great artist if he had any desire to do that. There was this painting he made for our family that hung in our den. I believe it was as good as any _PERSON_. My dad didn‚Äôt want that, though. His entire motivation was to be middle class and raise a family. He eventually got in trouble with the law, but a good lawyer got him a very good legal deal. He had to wear an ankle monitor for a while, and I think he was in jail for about six months. I don‚Äôt hate him now. I feel only pity."

Get 6 hours of sleep after 4 orb5 days no sleep, gets better but I go back to being unable to eat for days at a time for fear of throwing up. It‚Äôs a mess. But I had anxiety before sz, I pressured myself to get straight A‚Äôs in elementary school, but was a weird kid and beat up everyday. Got sent home a lot cause of bloody noses, girls ripping handfuls of hair out, etc. I know the reasons why, but I might offend someone unintentionally and once I got out of that particular school into a more diverse school, I didn‚Äôt get beat up.

As the father of an adult son with a mental illness and one of 14 nongovernment experts appointed by your administration to a panel that advises Congress about serious mental illnesses, I‚Äôd like to recount some well-established facts. It‚Äôs easy for the public to assume that anyone who commits mass murder is mentally ill. How could he or she not be? And several shooters in recent high-profile mass killings have had a serious mental disorder. But your implication that the 46 million American adults estimated to have a diagnosable mental illness and the 11.2 million thought to have a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are dangerous and potentially mass murder
ers is as wrongheaded as declaring that the 329 million Americans who are white are capable of committing mass homicide. After all, being white is one of the most common traits of a mass shooter. Data from Mother _NAME_ shows that between 1982 and 2017, 54 percent of mass shooters were white men. Research also shows that many of them struggle with a sense of entitlement attached to their white, heterosexual identity as well as economic anxiety in the post-industrial economy. http://www.peteearley.com/2019/08/08/hate-is-not-a-mental-illness-i-respond-in-washington-post-today-to-president-trumps-words/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+peteearley+(The+Official+Blog+of+Author+_NAME_+Earley)"

174363325,"Abstract Background The pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a major psychiatric disorder, remains elusive. In this study, the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) families, belonging to the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily, in schizophrenia, was analyzed. Methods The PPAR / RXR family genes were screened by exploiting molecular inversion probe (MIP)-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the samples of 1,200 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. The results were compared with the whole-genome sequencing databases of the Japanese cohort (ToMMo) and the gnomAD. To reveal the relationship between PPAR/RXR dysfunction and schizophrenia, Ppara KO mice and fenofibrate (a clinically used PPAR? agonist)-administered mice were assessed by performing behavioral, histological, and RNA-seq analyses. Findings Our findings indicate that c.209‚Äì2delA, His117Gln, Arg141Cys, and Arg226Trp of the PPARA gene are risk variants for schizophrenia. 
The c.209‚Äì2delA variant generated a premature termination codon. The three missense variants significantly decreased the activity of PPAR? as a transcription factor in vitro . The Ppara KO mice exhibited schizophrenia-relevant phenotypes, including behavioral deficits and impaired synaptogenesis in the cerebral cortex. Oral administration of fenofibrate alleviated spine pathology induced by phencyclidine, an N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Furthermore, pre-treatment with fenofibrate suppressed the sensitivity of mice to another NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. RNA-seq analysis revealed that PPAR? regulates the expression of synaptogenesis signaling pathway-related genes. Interpretation The findings of this study indicate that the mechanisms underlying schizophrenia pathogenesis involve PPAR?-regulated transcriptional machinery and modulation of synapse physiology. Hence, PPAR? can serve as a novel therapeutic target for schizophrenia. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2

176083964,"Thank you for this post. There are many of us who have had a lot of depression in our lives. Me too. It is hard to understand why a depression would need to be a long time. As I thought about this idea, I saw the strong relevance to our times. It‚Äôs money. I know several people with sz who are extremely poor. They are living on a few dollars a day. Like in the third world. When they are that poor, they lack some of the very basics for entertainment and happiness. I want to see us with sz somehow gain more money. Maybe it can be a dream. Secondly, _PERSON_ said yesterday there are millions of Americans right now who are deeply worried about their money. For example, losing their health insurance. With Covid, there are milllions who are now unemployed and have no income. I have to believe this is true, and it is severe. So our people desperately need money. I don‚Äôt know the solution, but this is the problem. I apologize for not responding more directly about depression."

I was like my little brother when I was young, ignoring fights."
176083967,"My grandparents came to the US from Germany in the 1920s. They obviously left some family behind. One of them owned a general store. He was not a member of the Nazi Party and was frequently having his windows broken and things stolen from the front displays. He joined the Party in an effort to stop the Nazis from vandalizing his store, and it worked. This was circa 1937 or so. His shop survived WWII, and after that, I have no information on him to provide. It‚Äôs just a weird thing to think ‚ÄúHey, you have a distant relative who was in the Nazi Party.‚Äù But if you look at it through the lens of doing it to protect his livelihood and not having political involvement, it becomes a little more palpable."
174363352,I‚Äôve been taking 200mg of L-Theanine for a few weeks now. I don‚Äôt notice any changes. I take it before I go to bed in the hopes it might help me relax more.
176083968,"Definitely. I feel guilty about so much. My doctor can attest to that. _PERSON_ I email her all the time freaking out about something that I may have passed on to Little LED or that I‚Äôve decided get to something or that she‚Äôs missing out on something. Everything. Guilt. It‚Äôs totally normal. It‚Äôs also a part of her mourning the life she wishes you had. When you have a kid, media sells you this idea that your kid will follow a certain path to old age. But that‚Äôs just not always the case and when that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve envisioned for so long, it takes a long time to adjust. So let your mom do her thing, let her feel guilty or sad or whatever, but don‚Äôt let it affect how you live your life. You don‚Äôt need to make it a circle."

176083976,"Since my husband and I started dating a week after I turned 15. We waited 9 months into the relationship to have sex, have been each others first, only, and probably last. As I was unmedicated till 23 had a very very active sex life. Even after 3 kids in 4 years, active sex life. Maybe once a week on bad weeks, or 4 times a week on good weeks. Then the meds, I shut down because of reactions, failures, just overall shitty time with AP and AD. Went off for a bit, sex life was more for him than me, I just basically lied there and went to sleep when he was done. Went off my meds for good March this year, the months of May-July were insane for me. He told me we had to physically stop cause he couldn‚Äôt handle how much I was demanding. Got physically hurt by ER in August, now it‚Äôs once every 3 weeks only cause I feel guilty not putting out for him He doesn‚Äôt make me or force me, nothing like that, but he gets depressed cause I am a _USER_ID_ and he doesn‚Äôt feel appreciated.

176083996,"I think it depends on how convicted you are/were in these beliefs. Whether it‚Äôs abstract thinking or pure psychosis or something in the middle. I don‚Äôt see you as a typical schizophrenic a lot of those beliefs are typical for schizotypi / schizotypal. They tend to be obsessed with the reality of the world. When i was in hospital last year, i was convinced i didn‚Äôt exist, somehow my soul or mind vanished. There are a lot of schizotypals obsessed with religious thinking, and your examples could be such, just exaggerated. A lot of schizotypals experience episodes of psychosis, so if you have been psychotic, you could still be schizotypal. You don‚Äôt hear voices, you don‚Äôt have disorder of thought, you have kind of delusions, but as i understand you, you are in doubt whether it‚Äôs just abstract, religious thinking, and whether you are wrong in your beliefs. I don‚Äôt see your way of thinking as an example of _NAME_ psychosis, and you write very coherent and eloquent and you can‚Äôt do that if 
you are psychotic I don‚Äôt know but when i first read you threads i thought they were typical examples of schizotypi. In the end i don‚Äôt know how much it really matter in regard to you treatment, medicine or not, but if it matters to the way you understand yourself, then talk to your pdoc about it."

176084007,No. Modern economics is winning. World War costs money and you move all your industry for war tools. That economic model from ww2 just isn‚Äôt viable these days.

I‚Äôm sure these days you can work with the Uni‚Äôs and look after your health and still graduate. It‚Äôs no slight on yourself to take it a little longer than others‚Ä¶seriously.

Soluble fiber for example lowers ldl etc Cholesterol in food gets converted to ldl or hdl in the body by lipoproteins (?). Trans and saturated are worse than cholesterol, they raise cholesterol, blood pressure and atherosclerosis which increases heart attack and stroke risk. I wish I could control my diet.

176084065,"I know smoking is common among schizophrenics, but I see a lot of people trying to quit and I myself am trying hard. I was curious if anybody here has done it, as some success stories might help give me the push I need! Also, if you did quit, how soon after did you notice health benefits?"

174363373,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Evaluation of hyperhomocysteinemia prevalence and its influence on the selected cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_?a, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry , Jun 26 2019 There is evidence that hyperhomocysteinemia may be associated with the development of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between cognitive functions and normal homocysteine concentrations vs. hyperhomocysteinemia in schizophrenia patients before and after supplementation with vitamins B6, B12 and folate. An 8-week prospective, non-randomized study enrolled 122 adult patients with schizophrenia (67F/55M, mean age 43.54?¬±?11.94?years). Homocysteine concentrations were measured in all individuals and afterwards hyperhomocysteinemia patients (n?=?42) were divided into two subgroups: treated with oral vitamins supplementation (B6 - 25?mg/d, B12 - 20??g
/d, folate - 2,5?mg/d) (n?=?22) and without supplementation (n?=?20). The assessment of schizophrenia symptoms severity in study group was performed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Stroop test and the Trail Making Test (TMT). We observed a higher prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in schizophrenia patients (34.4%) in comparison to the general population. Individuals with schizophrenia and coexisting hyperhomocysteinemia had worse performance on the Stroop and the TMT tests as well as higher PANSS scores. In these patients, supplementation with vitamins effectively decreased the homocysteine concentrations to the normal values, however there was no statistically significant improvement in the PANSS and cognitive test scores, except a significant decrease in the number of the Stroop test errors. We conclude that significant results obtained in this study show that there is a relationship between homocysteine blood concentration and schizophren
ia severity. Moreover, homocysteine concentration lowering might be beneficial in schizophrenia patients with hyperhomocysteinemia in terms of cognitive functions improvement."
176084067,"Jan 15 1965. My 8th birthday. Saw _NAME_ at the Leicester square Odeon followed by a birthday celebration at a Lyons corner house.It was a halcyon day before the storms gathered. I may have been odd, but if so other children had not reacted as though I was. 5 days later I started boarding school.The place where sons of diplomats go at the age of 8 or less. I was totally unsuited for it. I was faced with something I struggled to cope with. Not overtly traumatic ,but traumatic nonetheless. It manifested in bed-wetting. The differences between the other boys and me became glaringly apparent on going to public school. Like a lot of my generation found decades later to be autistic I was subjected to severe bullying. In my case it was verbal. The result was increasingly poor mental health resulting in an overdose at the end of my penultimate term there. I went back for what should have been my A level term so as not to disappointment my father. I lasted a week before saying I couldn‚Äôt cope. After a few 
days in the school sanatorium I was admitted to Severalls psychiatric hospital."

176084097,"When covid struck, my town started a volunteer grocery delivery service to people who couldn‚Äôt leave their homes.

I see people marching in the streets of my city every day because they believe in a world where we are all free. When I had covid, a perfect stranger brought me peanut butter and protein shakes because it was all Starlet would eat. She didn‚Äôt even ask for any money. When I got better, I gave away my old baby stuff to people who had babies born during the shutdown and were unable to buy things in stores. Yes. I believe in humanity. Even more than I did in 2019."

174363391,"We all went down in history. After my first psyche ward, someone suggested to my parents to put me in Soteria House. It may not be famous anymore but in the seventies and eighties is was semi-well known in psychiatric circles. It was a group home co-founded by a man named _PERSON_ who was extensively trained in the psychiatric field. The premise was that they thought that they could have a higher recovery rate for schizophrenics with this home as opposed to medication and hospitalization. So the founders purchased several or more houses around America and a few in Europe and purposely staffed it with young people who had no prior experience in the mental health field but they were hired for their personalities, their tolerance and open-mindedness, their friendliness and empathy etc. And this _PERSON_ started up these houses and dropped by frequently but he was not there all the time. They called this setup, ‚ÄúNormalizing the schizophrenic experience‚Äù. It meant there was no formal therapy, almost 
any behavior was tolerated except for substance abuse or violence. The staff listened to what people had to say about their delusions or voices or whatever we wanted to talk about and they didn‚Äôt judge, they just listened and empathized and sometime empathy is enough. So no one was on medication and this was an alternative to a hospital. There were no responsibilities, we barely had to clean but you couldn‚Äôt just cook a meal and leave messes, you had to clean up after yourself. I came and went as I pleased, I didn‚Äôt have to tell anyone where I was going or what I was doing. Almost no rules were in place. People freaked out sometimes, and believe me when I say that during the year that I was there I saw some really bizarre stuff. But I have to say that it didn‚Äôt help me at all. I wish I had never been put there because looking back I knew it didn‚Äôt help me and I wish I would have been put on medication and put in a better situation. The house was controversial in psychiatric circles to say the least. 
It was known around the world including all the other ones scattered across different countries. _PERSON_ claimed the house was a success and produced numbers and evidence that it helped more than hospitalizing someone. It‚Äôs detractors claimed the opposite and it was often debated whether these houses actually helped anyone. So I was part of psychiatric history! Most of the houses closed down in the mid-eighties but there are still a few around. The houses didn‚Äôt close because they didn‚Äôt help, they closed because of lack of funds to keep them running."
176084127,It really doesn‚Äôt sound like capylta is working out for you.
176084128,Never liked _PERSON_ Circle _PERSON_. Find the doughnut hole if your tired of the hero‚Äôs quest.
176084129,No Somewhat Yes 0 voters I do. Sometimes I wonder if my lack of desire to be around people is simply because I‚Äôll end up being rejected anyway I think ‚Äúrejection‚Äù is the background theme song playing in my life.

Poverty taking its toll on my psyche as my attempts to create and have more from life are treated as if they are ‚Äòowed‚Äô or ‚Äòowned‚Äô by someone or something else. Perhaps they are by birth right. A mentality of you will give us everything and get nothing. Truly at the mercy of the powers that be and company of me in my innovations and free thinking attempts for problem resolution. Time. Time. Time. I would love nothing more than to be able to afford the necessities of life and surround myself with information as I learn and to be able to provide jobs for our struggling economy. I imagine this to be a hot commodity these days as 
grant funding is a large source of capital gain. Feeling like I have burned all my bridges but to me it felt necessary to try and salvage tranquility of creation. Educators and people I greatly respected for their opinions and contributions now negative to me mentally. Where were they when being forced to eat cognitive disabling medications for their very presence that isn‚Äôt possible according to the doctors. So anger rises within me and I am made out to be the bad guy. There is no option but to succumb.

(The Respirdal was usually able to knock me out around 12 at latest especially after more prolonged sleep loss occurred) Trauma brings on the nightmares, which might actually be nigh terrors as my therapist thinks. There is a drug I could take for that but I am hesitant on adding more meds to my daily take. _AT_MENTION_ Thank you."

176084169,"No, not exactly. Thing is they started me off on 20mg and then I gradually went down to 5 mg. One thing I do know is that less than 3.75mg is a innefective dose for me, because then I am unable to sleep. 3.75 is a bit of a gamble too. 5mg is the lowest dose required for proper sleep in my experience. If you started on 5mg it might take a couple of weeks before the drugs builds up in your system, so hopefully you will find out as you go along. I started using a combo of hops, lemon balm and valerian root to combat the restlessness in the daytime, it seems to make a noticable difference. But be aware that valerian root seems to crash with zyprexa if you take it at the same time, so taking it in the morning might be the best option."

174363420,"I got my first job when I was 17; dishwashing at a local restaurant. My friend was working there already and he suggested I apply and he put in a good word for me. I worked there three months. Anyways over the course of the next two years I had about 15 different jobs, none lasting more than three months until I got sick at age 19. I was put in my first psyche ward at age 19. It was a bit of a surprise. I was seeing a therapist before that for several months but she had no clue how messed up I really was. I don‚Äôt blame her, I acted normal and just went in each week and talked like nothing was wrong with me. But then the head psychiatrist at the clinic called a meeting with me, my therapist, my parents and him. And after talking for about 20 minutes he told my parents that I needed to be put in a psyche ward immediately . I remember my therapist who was this really, nice, cute 28 year old woman cried because she had no idea how sick I really was. I don‚Äôt blame her at all, I‚Äôm sure many of us a
ct normal in front of doctors or therapists and no one can tell what‚Äôs really going on with us. My parents drove me to the ward about a hundred miles away and checked me in. I remember sitting on the bed in my room and thinking that I had now crossed a line and I could never go back. And I wasn‚Äôt psychotic at the time but in three days I sure was and that was the beginning of my 39 years with paranoid schizophrenia. But it was funny because from there I went directly to Soteria House in downtown San _NAME_, Ca. My parents got me in. I remember when I arrived there were a few other young people there and when I got inside one guy stuck out his hand to shake hands and smiled and welcomed me there and other residents were looking at me curiously. My first impression was that it was going to be like some fun summer camp. That feeling lasted until the next morning when my suffering started in _NAME_ and continued non-stop for the next 2 1/2 years. I was there about 4 days and I had walked downtown a couple of 
days already and on the fourth day I just did what came naturally to me and I went looking for a job. No one told me to do it. But no one told me not to do it. My dad instilled in me a pretty good work ethic and that popped up and I got up one morning on my own and walked up and down the busy street and put in applications at about 7 or 8 different businesses. And about two days later a popular donut shop and a Salvation Army store called me in for an interview and then they both offered me jobs. I thought about it and chose the donut shop; I don‚Äôt remember why I chose it over the Salvation Army. So I started working. It wasn‚Äôt that bad though I was really screwed up mentally. But when my parents found out about my job they told me to quit. They told me I didn‚Äôt have to work, just to concentrate on getting better. They thought it was really funny though that even though I was sick that my instincts and my natural work ethic had made me get a job when I was just diagnosed with schizophrenia. So after thr
ee days I quit. Also it was kind of funny that my boss didn‚Äôt want to pay me for three days, he just gave me two dozen free donuts, lol, instead of money! It didn‚Äôt bother me and I took the donuts to my new home and shared with everybody. What pissed me off was that the damn counselors ate most of them. And various stuff happened and now here I am at age 58 still working and living in a nice apartment. Life is kind of funny that way."

174363421,"Actually NAC does change your Domanine. Schizophrenia is more abnormal, so good for some not others. Basically, there is some support in favor of amino acids.

ons in dreams to make me look like a bad person. The voices have told me those dreams are recorded in a spiritual memory, and that they will be shown to me when I‚Äôm being tortured after I die, and that I will be made to believe they happened in reality not in a dream) Dreams where I feel unpleasant alien feelings, like the ones my schizophrenia inflicts upon me while I‚Äôm awake Dreams where I hear a voice like the one I hear while I‚Äôm awake Dreams where I hallucinate sounds; at one time the hallucination (a weird high pitched sound) continued from dream to awake state The dreams started on one day in the hospital. Before that I mostly slept without seeing a dream, starting from that day I‚Äôve seen dreams every single night. Each and every one of the themes I mentioned I‚Äôve experienced multiple times. One night the voice knew in advance and told me what I‚Äôm going to dream.

On another note, my insurance no longer wants to cover my Austedo (TD meds). There are two- TWO- TD meds on the market. The other is Ingrezza, which doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm also getting by with Saphris and Vraylar because my pdoc is giving me samples as insurance no longer covers those. If she will prescribe, like, 40 Saphris tabs a month, they would cover it, though. Maybe that would work? I have no idea what to do abo
ut the other two. I am VERY stressed about the Austedo, though. I don‚Äôt want my TD to get bad again. I‚Äôm managing right now. When it gets bad, I feel more depressed, more like giving up because it makes things seem so hopeless. I can‚Äôt function with the TD when it‚Äôs un-medicated. Sorry for venting, but I‚Äôm super stressed. Thanks for reading."
176084266,You are going so fast! I think you‚Äôll surpass me pretty soon. You are right around my starting weight
176084267,For me it can be anything. Usually just out of the blue and idea will strike and I need to get it out.
174363451,Right. You cant just inject humans with sh√≠t and hope it doesn‚Äôt kill them. Using mice is the lesser of two evils.
174363461,"I had success moving from Risperdal to zyprexa. Zyprexa really does work for me but we‚Äôre all so different. I found risperdal good for getting me out of psychosis but had problems with cognition. I found zyprexa to be better all round. I also tried abilify for a while and that wasn‚Äôt as good. There‚Äôs really little direct evidence to what works but it is, in my opinion , worthwhile trying for better function and thus changing meds. It‚Äôs really worked for me over the years but it‚Äôs also wasted some time and made things hard as well. It‚Äôs a bit of a crap shoot but it‚Äôs worth it in the long run‚Ä¶ I think anyways."
176084268,Yes. But the one you see me using here is not exactly representative of what I find funny. I use this site to practice humour in online interactions. It‚Äôs a social lubricant. Heaven knows we all need more lube as we grab our ankles through the workday.

176084273,If you are quitting any AP with the blessing of a doctor You want to taper down super slow! I heard 10% every time A lot of people fail to get off there AP because of cold turkey or too rapid reduction in there medication We are trying to reduce harm here as much as possible Be prepared for extra pyramidal side effects to take place. And yes tardive psychosis is a withdrawal symptom as well Also extreme dopamine sensitivity It‚Äôs completely terrifying to be honest I loaded up with Benadryl because it helps with dystonia And you will be constipated So you‚Äôll need flax seeds too You also need somebody monitoring you to make sure you are okay the whole time through A good expensive high quality super bioavailable multvitamin would be helpful Do your research And talk to your doc Who knows perhaps tapering Down one mg down will dramatically improve the quality of your life and you may be happy with just that

174363454,"How? We can already get disability money and cheap housing. I mean its no one‚Äôs fault that we have schizophrenia, I think its God‚Äôs. I got accepted into many jobs while on Abilify but I didn‚Äôt last more than 1-2 weeks so now my CV is unacceptable after 10+ failed jobs. I quit all my jobs by myself from stress and paranoia of ppl. I fear strangers, I stay in bed all day everyday, only get up to eat."
176084278,How do the alters communicate with you?
176084279,"Its enough if you get cheap disability housing, they‚Äôre 300-400$/month here. Idk about other countries but pretty sure they are cheaper than regular houses."

174363445,"So you have been or are on the Maintena yourself? How long did it take you to at least see some improvement? Or maybe you‚Äôre still on it, I don‚Äôt know, but I wish you well. In my case, after 120 days, I still feel terrible. In fact, I feel like my condition has gotten even worse over time when it comes to anxiety. A few months ago I didn‚Äôt have much problem with going out for a walk, now it‚Äôs a nightmare for me, scared that I‚Äôll meet neighbors and will have to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù, ridiculous. Recently I had like two weeks that I felt so bad I couldn‚Äôt get up and make myself a breakfast, I didn‚Äôt feel strong enough to even do such thing. But it has improved fortunately, I can take care of myself. About supplements, I don‚Äôt take any. I was wondering if I should, so first of all I started to eat a lot of products containing tryptophan and tyrosine but it didn‚Äôt help at all, so I‚Äôm back to my standard diet. I was even thinking about buying a so called ‚ÄúN-acetyl Tyrosine‚Äù, but then I 
realised that no matter how good my diet would be or what supplements I‚Äôd take, it won‚Äôt work simply because of the antagonism of dopamine receptors caused by Abilify. Not even dopamine agonists would help, because an antagonist has a greater receptor affinity. I once read about some older woman‚Äôs case that she has been given quetiapine in a hospital and as a result she got a reversible aphasia. Shortly after stopping the drug, the aphasia has disappeared and they described it on a website that the reason must have been the antagonism of dopamine receptors. So I‚Äôm hoping that in my case it‚Äôs also reversible and it‚Äôll disappear as the drug clears out. What makes me wonder is that aripiprazole is a partial agonist of D2 receptor and an antagonist of D3 receptor and generally for a lot of people the drug is good for cognitive functions, I wonder why for some it‚Äôs the opposite."
176084282,"I saw a story on the news that said that the college students were having their Spring Break parties in spite of the Corona virus. It showed them crowded together over huge stretches of beach. It‚Äôs probably inevitable that they get hundreds, if not thousands, of avoidable Corona infections."

176084284,Sounds like you just want a gun because you‚Äôre not allowed to have one.

176084286,"When you first got sick, were you feeling symptoms of everything else that you mentioned? Did the dog bite lead to you feeling bad shortly after that? My guess is that the brain lesion may have resulted in a bad(or inadequate) signal to your thyroid gland, not telling it to make enough hormones that your thyroid is supposed to make. The _PERSON_ is kind of tricky and tests the healthy functioning of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, so I‚Äôm not sure if there may be a faulty brain signal that‚Äôs affecting your balancing. For the hypreflexia, there is a quick google search that says some of it may have to do with ‚ÄúUpper Neuron Disease‚Äù, so that may be a hint. Issues with the brain can also cause double vision. I doubt Schizophrenia may have caused this, as it‚Äôs not known to cause neurological issues. But the brain lesion probably did."

Well now I still think there‚Äôs some significance in my life from divine reasoning but it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. I know this delusion is completely gone now In a sense . I‚Äôve had years ago that I stopped believing for a month or two on end but still felt I was lying to myself by not believing in the delusion.

174363473,The youtuber in question has actually gotten alot of anger from the DID community because of misinformation and how incorrect it seems and _NAME_ is very much known for trolling on things like this in the past such as claiming to be trans. I‚Äôve just never heard schizophrenia being used as traits before so I just really wanted clarity on that and If that can be interlinked with DID ect. I‚Äôm unaware because I only gone through the schizophrenic side and personally wasn‚Äôt aware that they could be linked as a lot of my knowledge of DID is limited

It‚Äôs easy to think that if we start over our reputation will be a clean slate.

Worse than stimulants though we cannot notice it. Also it not give much effect either only some 5 or 10% improvement which is not significant enough to take it daily. Omega 3 fish oil is best for cognition. Take it daily. It helps with attention.

176084450,"That is pretty interesting. Even though it does not directly bind dopamine it apparently modulates presynaptic dopamine. ‚ÄúThe Novel, Non-D2 Psychotropic Agent SEP-363856 Modulates Presynaptic Dopamine Function in Mice,‚Äù ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia: version III--the final common pathway. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia bulletin , May 2009 The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively 
review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream 
of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway.

Second,for the human listener,if the hallucination entity makes a sound (broadcasting the voices),the spoken words of the hallucination has acts as an understood thoughts (understood thoughts by its nature that do not need to makes mental effort to understanding its concepts ),and not like words that are issued in the external environment and picked up by the ear !

176084488,"In women, a high blood level of prolactin often causes hypoestrogenism with anovulatory infertility and a decrease in menstruation. In some women, menstruation may disappear altogether (amenorrhoea). In others, menstruation may become irregular or menstrual flow may change. Women who are not pregnant or nursing may begin producing breast milk. Some women may experience a loss of libido (interest in sex) and breast pain, especially when prolactin levels begin to rise for the first time, as the hormone promotes tissue changes in the breast. Intercourse may become difficult or painful because of vaginal dryness. In men, the most common symptoms of hyperprolactinaemia are decreased libido, sexual dysfunction (in both men and women), erectile dysfunction, infertility, and gynecomastia. Because men have no reliable indicator such as menstruation to signal a problem, many men with hyperprolactinaemia being caused by a pituitary adenoma may delay going to the doctor until they have headaches or eye problem
s caused by the enlarged pituitary pressing against the adjacent optic chiasm. They may not recognize a gradual loss of sexual function or libido. Only after treatment do some men realize they had a problem with sexual function. Because of hypoestrogenism and hypoandrogenism, hyperprolactinaemia can lead to osteoporosis"

I feel like this would remind us that there is hope in treatment and we can all learn from the thread if it has quality information posted. Does anyone else agree?

Then, I started ordering only four. Now I only have three. The less food is available, the less you eat. Make smaller portions, have smaller plates, cut down on the amount of snacks you have available. Try to switch some of your soda to light or sugar free. Do it in small steps so you get used to it."

176084533,"My mother is taking Olanzapine since long years, and she had a suicide attempt 8 days after the Covid vaccination (Sputnik vaccine: the Russian one). She luckily survived but the desire to die is unfortunately still there‚Ä¶ she told this to me today. The doctors say this it a mere coincidence that this happened after the vaccination‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I am not a doctor, but I do have concerns‚Ä¶ I am very very concerned about the second dosage which is yet to come in 2 weeks time. She is 69 years old now. She was diagnosed in 1982 (actually before I was born ). There is no suicide attempt in her medical records, even if she was completely without treatment for appr. 15 years in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. She is under constant treatment since 2000. Now she has been feeling unwell since December‚Ä¶ but it rapidly got worse 2 days after the vaccination. She wanted to kill herself because she could not bear the voices in her head any more. I am not saying that there is anything bad in the vaccine‚Ä¶ but can it ma
ybe suppress the effect of Olanzapine? What I know for sure is that vaccine producers state that they did not check cross-reactions with other medication. So there is not data about this at all‚Ä¶ I have also read that there is research which confirms linkages between schizophrenia and the immune system‚Ä¶can a strong immune reaction make schizophrenia symptoms worse? I really do not want to discourage anyone from taking the vaccine ‚Ä¶because if someone gets covid, then they receive a lot of medication‚Ä¶ and those were not tested I guess with Olanzapine either‚Ä¶ Is there any immunologist out there who can answer my questions? Is there someone who experienced stronger symptoms after the vaccine? If you have a relative who takes Olanzapine think it is worth to pay a little extra attention after the vaccination‚Ä¶"
176084534,If that‚Äôs the case then just take something to counter the effects or try lithium
176084535,"Cool, that is like the NHS then, I was beginning to wonder wat other countries do that"

Later, extremely ill, unable to function, in hospital, -got an AP and that helped my mood but as a byproduct of not being as clinically ill. Happy?

He adopted a hobby of photography. He had lots of boredom. He had few friends. When he got old he started losing his vision and he needed vision to watch TV. He had a mentally ill (like childhood schizophrenia) son Named _NAME_ and my grandfather loved _NAME_ with all his heart and soul. Profound love.

176084607,"About the first thing you learn when you read about sz is the fact that it bears no relation to multiple personality disorder. That said, ambivalence is a big theme in sz. This is the thing: I feel two two distinct identities emerging within myself regarding the issue of suicide. The first one is still capable of laughing, functioning to some extent, and feels guilty regarding death. The second clings on so-called delusions, such as me being a divine being, or the possibility that my death would constitute a legitimate sacrifice to the unknown god. Do you also have the experiences of distinct selves, relatively autonomous yet fully aware of each other? PS.

You and your words were an answer to my prayer! You should be a health care worker - the medical field NEEDS you!! Thank you for taking the time, consideration, and kindness to break this down and speak to my thoughts. You carried my burdens!! You made everything feel more simple and less threatening! I keep reading your post again and again as the anxiety swarms in and around me! THANK YOU!!"
174363539,"I worked a 30+ hour workweek for over 4 years. I made about 3.5k per month. Stress level was moderate. I struggled making small talk with co-workers but once work started I was fine. But eventually it got to be too much, I relapsed on drugs and was hospitalized. When I emerged, I could no longer work, I quit and was reinstated on disability. Those 4+ years I worked was in sales where I had to interact with others. A definite positive is that I‚Äôm no longer freaked out about socializing with strangers. I still have anxiety with new acquaintances but it‚Äôs a work in progress."

174363551,My psychosis was already fine without paliperidone. I was on clozapine 175mg. Our plan was to reduce clozapine due to worsening anxiety on it and add paliperidone. So paliperidone did not worked out well. Our previous plan was to add olanzapine and reduce clozapine. I stopped olanzapine within 2 days due to cognitive side effects. I‚Äôm thinking about giving it another try cuz i stopped it too soon. Maybe take olanzapine for atleast 10 days and then decide.

174363558,"From the Red Cross USA In almost all cases, medications will not disqualify you as a blood donor. Your eligibility will be based on the reason that the medication was prescribed. As long as the condition is under control and you are healthy, blood donation is usually permitted. Over-the-counter oral homeopathic medications, herbal remedies, and nutritional supplements are acceptable. There are a handful of drugs that are of special significance in blood donation. Persons on these drugs have waiting periods following their last dose before they can donate blood: Accutane, Amnesteem, Absorica, Claravis, Myorisan, Sotret or Zenatane (isotretinoin), Proscar (finasteride), and Propecia (finasteride) - wait 1 month from the last dose. Avodart or Jalyn (dutasteride) - wait 6 months from the last dose. Aspirin, no waiting period for donating whole blood. However you must wait 2 full days after taking aspirin or any medication containing aspirin before donating platelets by apheresis‚Ä¶ For example, if you 
take aspirin products on Monday, the soonest you may donate platelets is Thursday. Effient (prasugrel) and Brilinta (ticagrelor)- no waiting period for donating whole blood. However you must wait 7 days after taking this medication before donating platelets by apheresis. Feldene (piroxicam), no waiting period for donating whole blood. However you must wait 2 days after taking Feldene (piroxicam) before donating platelets by apheresis. Arixtra (fondaparinux), Coumadin, Warfilone, Jantoven (warfarin) and Heparin, are prescription blood thinners- you should not donate since your blood will not clot normally. If your doctor discontinues your treatment with blood thinners, wait 7 days before returning to donate. Fragmin (dalteparin), Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran),Savaysa (edoxaban), Xarelto (rivaroxaban),and Lovenox (enoxaparin) are also prescription blood thinners- you should not donate since your blood will not clot normally. If your doctor discontinues your treatment with these blood thinners, wait 2 
days before returning to donate. Other prescription blood thinners not listed, call _PHONE_NO_ to speak with an eligibility specialist about your individual situation. Hepatitis B Immune Globulin ‚Äì given for exposure to hepatitis, wait 12 months after exposure to hepatitis. Human pituitary-derived growth hormone at any time - you are not eligible to donate blood. Plavix (clopidogrel), Ticlid (ticlopidine) and Zontivity (vorapaxar) - no waiting period for donating whole blood. However you must wait 14 days after taking this medication before donating platelets by apheresis. Soriatane (acitretin) ‚Äì wait 3 years. Tegison (etretinate) at any time ‚Äì you are not eligible to donate blood. Erivedge (vismodegib) and Odomzo (sonidegib)‚Äì wait 2 years. Aubagio (teriflunomide) ‚Äì wait 2 years."

If you‚Äôre asking if I like it then yes I do.
176084695,Make new happy ones. Build a better life for yourself so you dont miss what you had in the old one so much. I remember when i moved in middle school and was so sad. I had left some of the best friends of my life behind and was having trouble making new friends at my new school. I became depressed and thought about my old home every day. Then I heard the song ‚Äúshadow of the day‚Äù by _NAME_ Park and it sparked this sort of aha moment to where i was like focusing on the past isn‚Äôt benefiting me it is just making me sad. And I chose to let go and focus on my new home and I started hunting down people who I could be friends with and I was no longer depressed about it.

174363567,"I should do that. Unfortunately though I don‚Äôt talk to her for a while since shes so busy. I do think some of my medications are also for my depression but the way they‚Äôve spoken to me about it makes me feel like its more of trying to control my mood because of symptoms of schizophrenia. Since the ativan, atarax and olanzapine were given to me for when I‚Äôm panicking due to schizophrenia. Except ativan is prescribed for everyday while the olanzapine is for when I feel out of control. At least that‚Äôs what I got out of the latest conversations."

174363568,the dr didnt tell me anything about prescribing clozapine though?? and why would it be in my food anyway
176084736,"Yeah well this disease causes some inappropriate thoughts by what we consider normal people, but I think it may help later on down the road to purify your thoughts"

176084740,That‚Äôs a good idea _AT_MENTION_
176084741,Cool. Looks good. I liked that show.
176084742,Have you changed your meds or their dose recently?
176084743,A banana. Or some brownies
176084744,"I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of the post where this was discussed, so here is a snippet from the latest email from Dying with Dignity, the assisted end-of-life group *_NAME_, It‚Äôs a momentous day for end-of-life rights in Canada. After months of parliamentary debate, Canada‚Äôs Senate has passed Bill C-7 by a vote of 60-25. Over the past year, you were one of the tens of thousands of Canadians who expressed support for the bill, and urged our country‚Äôs decision-makers to expand access to assisted dying. Your efforts paid off. Though this bill is not perfect, it will give Canadians fairer access to their constitutional right to make informed end-of-life choices and ease the suffering of many who are currently denied a peaceful and dignified death under the law.*"
176084745,It‚Äôs definitely a nuisance.

176084748,"My Delusions dont have me at all - whilst medicated. But the same tired old crap of me being an ‚Äúangel for children‚Äù rears its ugly head when im over-tired, drunk, or not done the meds. And even then i try to logic it away. But as you know, when your in the grip of one ‚Äúit just makes sense‚Äù ."
176084749,You aren‚Äôt medicated? I would be in a rubber room in a straight jacket without my meds.
176084750,I too have a fatty liver. Although certain meds can contribute to a fatty liver the main culprit is an unhealthy high carbohydrate diet. I‚Äôm addressing my fatty liver by changing what I eat. I‚Äôm seeing a nutritionist who placed me on a low carb anti inflammatory diet. So far I‚Äôm seeing good results. My cholesterol levels are down to normal and my blood sugar levels have been stable. My A1C was at 5.7. There are no reliable treatments for a fatty liver other than eating a low carb diet. Definitely stay away from junk foods full of sugar and saturated fats. Seeing a nutritionist might be a good idea because it‚Äôs important to have a healthy liver. Good luck!
176084751,"Well, I‚Äôm not surprised it‚Äôs difficult. Being new at any job is difficult. Sounds like you got unlucky and have not only a manager who doesn‚Äôt do her job well but now an unhelpful, irresponsible co-worker. Most of my 20 or 25 jobs took longer than two days to learn. IDK what to say except I‚Äôve had jobs where I only lasted one day but on the other hand I‚Äôve had my current job 7 years and everything in between. Life is a crap shoot at best and so is finding the right job. Don‚Äôt let a job put you in the hospital but give yourself a fair chance to try and stick it out. Yeah, two days is not enough to learn any job I‚Äôve ever had."
176084752,"How long would you say? I have been taking a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement for about 2 months, and I just started a Vitamin B Complex. Not sure what difference it will make, but I‚Äôd be interested to hear your experiences as this is the first time I have tried this."
176084753,Haha _AT_MENTION_‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre so funny
176084754,I think it was organic psychosis.
176084755,"I am on 5-HTP as well, have been for years. It works infinitely better for me than an antidepressant because it actually raises your serotonin levels, rather than merely trapping it in your brain. You can buy sarcosine online, if that‚Äôs a possibility."

176084770,"I think too many doctors accept ‚Äúnot actively violent/suicidal‚Äù as the gold standard for a med working. It isn‚Äôt fair. They aren‚Äôt the ones that have to live with the side effects. There are other meds to try. You have been stable on risperidone long enough that I think you should be allowed to try a slow switch to a new med. I know you don‚Äôt get much say in pdocs in Canada, but could you possibly get a second opinion? There is a lot to risk by switching, but as long as you go slow, and stay closely monitored, you should be allowed to try. It‚Äôs not like you are trying to stop meds completely. You are very aware of the dangers involved. You just want a better quality of life."
176084771,"Maybe it‚Äôs time for an intensive outpatient program where you can talk about what coping methods you‚Äôve tried and get new suggestions that might work. If you need weed to deal with life, you might need the iop program"

176084780,"I would like to understand why‚Ä¶ There is no gain for me to live like this. I give up every day things like dishes, storage etc. I even gradually give up hygiene a little. I do not know why. I was really very picky with hygiene before. I don‚Äôt really feel anxious but just sad and tired. I think if I went to bed earlier it would be better. But why can‚Äôt I? It despairs me a bit. I still manage to get out of my house etc. But this has been going on for several months. Do you easily get to bed early after living at night for a long time? Is this the consequence or the cause of my problems? Thank you."
176084781,That‚Äôs what I hear some are good and some are bad. I dont feel comfortable telling them anything for reasons you have described.
174363583,"I think my relapse was caused by shitty goverment services and now that in private practice my mental health is doing much better. In goverment I never saw a psychiatrist and it was a nurse deciding whether to up my meds. Also was on fluonxol which is much less effective than risperidone or abilify, which Is what I am on now. Busy with a switch in meds and moving from risperidone to abilify so will see if that works out."

176084790,Congrats good luck!!
176084791,"Yep, its not designed for you. I learnt that the hard way. Weed is good for the brain is stoner talk. The reality is you will be lazy and motivationaless.

174363582,I think all humans are capable of being delusional with out a mental sickness take religion for instance. If you can‚Äôt comprehend evolution is the true existence of life in the universe then it‚Äôs delusional to think anything more than evolution is the key factor for life in the universe. So no aliens didn‚Äôt bring us here to colonize the planet. Or did we get here by some magical being snap their fingers and the universe appear with life as all God like religious beliefs make you believe. Yes aliens exist in this universe we share but have we been visited by them or are they coming is yet to be seen and proven.

However, every day before I have to go to work I practically have an anxiety attack because of the transition from doing nothing to having to go drive far away and start working. It is not the work itself that stresses me out and once I actually get to work and start I am fine. It is just right before I have to go that my anxiety gets really bad.

Tracking my food in a calorie tracker to make sure I‚Äôm in my range. I went over to 1800 calories for a planned treat on Saturday and gained a pound. It‚Äôs a constant battle. I‚Äôve managed to lose 16 pounds while on it, but in the first month, I stayed within 1200-1400 calories and gained a pound. It took four weeks to start losing. Hopefully that evens out for you too.

176084931,I have dated since after I was diagnosed I‚Äôve had several boyfriends. I understand I‚Äôm not as attractive to a partner because of all my illnesses and that I do not work. I accept things I don‚Äôt want in a partner since I know I have my flaws too. I accepted partners that smoke even though I don‚Äôt . What I was looking for in a partner could make them stuck up I mean I don‚Äôt want a stuck up partner who looks down at me and trashes me. I am not happy that my boyfriend smokes and is poor but smokes anyway. If I date again I want to be more picky and say that smoking is not ok and I won‚Äôt date a smoker. Also someone spiritual and who cares about animals and environment and who is stable. My boyfriend has panick attacks and may not be so stable. He has also tried to commit suicide . Yeah if I date again I hope to be more picky. I was not picky because I have so many diseases they would have to accept. My boyfriend has a stunning beard and he is fat but really nice. He has no teeth and wears fal
se teeth. I think it‚Äôs the smoking despite being so poor that bothers me . I want a partner who takes care of themselves. Ok to eat a bit of junk sometimes but to not take care of yourself when I work so hard trying to take care of myself is a bit of a turn of. I used to be a smoker and not take care of myself but now that I do take care of myself it bothers me that my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt take care of himself. I had a guy on dating site try scam me and I had one report me as a scammer so my profile was removed but I was innocent but I didn‚Äôt want to date him n that was his revenge. Guess it can take a while dating sometimes.

Women and LGBT folks have a culture of being emotionally affectionate with their friends, and looking to friends for support. Straight guys are discouraged from seeking this very normal human need with anyone besides a girlfriend/wife. So straight guys have it much worse when they can‚Äôt get a girlfriend, because they have zero sources of emotional validation when all human beings need at least one. I think it comes off a bit patronizing when women and lgbt folks on the forum dismiss the intense lonliness these guys can feel. Yes, forming friendships is also important. Yes, you should like your life before you seek to share it with others. But humans need someone to be emotionally close to, it literally keeps our brain chemistry in check. And straight guys are just starved for those opportunities."

176085129,For 2021 I plan to get a Covid vaccine first of all. My partner will too. They are administering them now at my local VA hospital. Both Pfizer and Moderna. I was surprised.

176085131,interesting.how you doing on medication.do you take anything or are u ok without medication.

176085154,Hope you feel better soon.
176085155,I just started this one. It‚Äôs horror. Supposed to be about ghosts and dark secrets.
176085156,I recently had what‚Äôs called a sebaceous cyst (it‚Äôs a benign type thing) but it got infected and we did in fact have to get it lanced. Which is technically known as surgery in my scenario anyway and it was really easy. Just adding my two cents._USER_ID_: it was located in my armpit.
176085157,"Sorry you‚Äôre having physical symptoms _AT_MENTION_ How long have you been on your current meds? Before starting meds, I would have tactile hallucinations and these strange headaches that started at the crown of my head and would move all the way down the back of my neck-- they were really painful. Not sure if they were somatic or not, but I rarely have them now that I‚Äôve started taking medication. Wishing you well!"
176085158,I feel like it‚Äôs immature people who try to dominate me. They can‚Äôt be controlled and are stupid.
176085159,"‚ÄùYes, those are so delusional thoughts that schizophrenia seems to be it. Where did you come up with that gas if it‚Äôs not hallucinatory? Don‚Äôt self-diagnose when it seems to go all the way to the ass. BPD doesn‚Äôt sound like any of those ‚Ä¶ More like a delusional disorder, but it does sound like schizophrenia ‚Ä¶ As you, I would be honest about the symptoms and accept the opinion of a psychiatrist. BPD is a personality disorder, but your symptoms are quite psychotic, and you suffer from obvious delusions, and possibly also hallucinations (how did you come up with gas, did you see it?).‚Äù Someone wrote this to me"
176085160,It‚Äôs frustrating but better than having commanding voices for sure
176085161,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a rough time but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been able to be productive
176085162,"Yeah, that CS degree is a lot more employment friendly than the philosophy degree. Congrats on getting it by the way!"

176085163,Bowel movement is crucial and can be life threatening so it deserve respect
176085164,Yes but its insulting to call someone an attention seeker with low IQ/intelligence especially when it isn‚Äôt the case
176085165,_AT_MENTION_. Well if you find someone y‚Äôall can enjoy audio books?? I find it easier to pay attention to an audio book and at times my fiance will ask what I wanna watch and I‚Äôll say either cops (reruns on pluto) or an audio book and he‚Äôll let me do that no matter how many times we‚Äôve watched the same episode because he understands me and respects my illnesses‚Ä¶ Another thing‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve been together almost a year and have never gotten into a serious argument‚Ä¶ We always just talk it out before it becomes a problem _AT_MENTION_ is it weird we still haven‚Äôt had a serious argument??
176085166,If you have to hide them to seem non psychotic doesn‚Äôt that tell you that they are delusions?
176085167,Ive been hospitalized about 15 times and have had many episodes I just cannot count them.
176085168,I feel like I can still learn and I enjoy learning new things. But ask me to file some papers and I need someone to give me the instructions. It‚Äôs so strange.

174363687,No I don‚Äôt. Just plain ol‚Äô paranoid schizophrenia. It‚Äôs not really a mood issue though it‚Äôs just this hungover feeling that varies in intensity. Today it was pretty bad. Very bad in fact. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre suffering with inconsistency too.

176085181,Anyone know if lumateperone will be available in Europe? I have to ask my pdoc when I see her next week.
176085182,I know. It‚Äôs so disconcerting that I had such a high only to be followed by a very low low.
176085183,I‚Äôll probably go out partying. My friends normally do something on new years. I can‚Äôt really drink or smoke weed though so I just kind of watch my friends get wasted and eat cookies.
174363672,"Yeah, if you have schizophrenia you need antipsychotics. There are no effective natural approaches to putting schizophrenia in remission that have widespread publicity, that I know of. Data on that approach is spotty. I‚Äôm trying a pro-antioxidant approach to get my brain and body out of the chronic ‚Äúoxidative impairment‚Äù mode that would otherwise make my symptoms worse with tissue deterioration, but it‚Äôs not a quick fix. I have enough data to lean on saying ‚Äúthis works‚Äù, but as for full remission, it‚Äôs only been 2 1/2 months of that approach. I imagine it‚Äôll take longer to fully put my schizophrenia in remission, and it‚Äôll work alongside antipsychotics."
176085184,My visions some times come up in front of my eye like it‚Äôs a picture really there blocking my view
176085185,"It‚Äôs difficult to deal with. My immediate family all point the blame on medication taking , with no appreciation for the fact that med is not cute, it‚Äôs just symptomatic management. Having to explain it can happen regardless of med presence is tiring and depressing recurrence; you get the feel people want you to shut up, sit quiet and drug yourself - play it like a wallflower ; you cry inside but on the surface you can‚Äôt even muster the energy to be properly bothered by it Honestly, this is partly why so many turn to finishing up what the genes don‚Äôt seem to want to directly do unlike say cancer"

176085194,"i liked my first stay the most. could workout and play basketball, food was good, and had a big floor to walk around in. didn‚Äôt see much of the doctors, they always had a community meeting each night where everybody on the floor would talk. i remember one night they asked, ‚Äúwhere would you like to travel to‚Äù i said new zealand but have since changed my mind and want to visit amsterdam in the summer. i had a roommate i remember but he was in his 50‚Äôs and chill, he watched basketball every night on the television so we got along as i also like basketball. that‚Äôs when i decided to become vegan for a few years. and we had big windows where you could absorb the sun, but we weren‚Äôt allowed to go outside, most days i sat in the window all day. i don‚Äôt particular care for my local hospital though, the food is better there, but not much to do, and someone is always watching daytime televisioin while im there. which drives me crazy. they have one stationary bike you can ride for exercise and th
at‚Äôs it. most people don‚Äôt stay long also, i think i would like to experience a year in a hospital to refocus myself and maybe appreciate my freedom more, but other than that i have no reason to admit myself, and someone else probably needs the bed worse."

176085200,"Many, many years ago, I was fooling around with a hooker who was also my friend and we needed more money. So we went looking for an ATM and finally found one a little ways away. I got out of my car and was walking towards the ATM when I heard her shriek, ‚ÄúOh my god, you‚Äôre dick‚Äôs hanging out.‚Äù I looked down to check it out and damned if she wasn‚Äôt right! I wasn‚Äôt wearing any underwear and I didn‚Äôt zip up good enough and so I was walking around in broad daylight, flopping around with people just a little ways away. I thought it was hilarious but I stopped and tucked it back in and zipped up. Went to the ATM without skipping a beat, got some cash and we went on our merry way. Another funny thing was that I wondered why a darn hooker would get so upset at the sight of some guys penis. I mean she‚Äôs seen a million of them."
176085201,It will.Just don‚Äôt worry about it.That‚Äôs major change in your life.I hated to see you suffering.
176085202,I think I am among the schizophrenics who can hold their own with general society. I use a general-purpose forum in Hebrew( that caters to regular people) and it appears that my level of stamina is better than that of some people there.

176085205,"Yes I do experience it sometimes. It‚Äôs just body‚Äôs response to stress, anxiety and energy. I would recommend to go at least for long walks. Stay in a dark room before bedtime, avoid overstimulation."
176085206,"I don‚Äôt masturbate because I feel no pleasure. I have no sex drive anymore, no urges, no arousal. But if I did have urges and arousal I would love to pleasure myself, it‚Äôs the healthiest way to take care of sexual urges.

176085209,"this happened to me, it was a panic attack. Marijuana is dangerously under estimated, for me personally, one puff and im in a psychosis, immediately and it lasts the duration of the high, 1 hour and a half. Then, well life is dull due to the lack of stimulation experienced post manic episode. I dont recommend marijuana, simply put its an escape, regardless of diagnosis."
176085210,What about getting the jab every second week. A professor here told me that for some the monthly is too far apart and its better to get it twice a month. Usually that resolves the issue of going a little bonkers the week before an injection. Side effects wise you feel the same and I know this from experience

174363679,Hello. Does anyone know how to counter the tiredness caused by Clozapine? I sleep for 10-11 hours and can barely get up from bed. I take 325mg every night at 10 and go to bed at 11.

176085231,There is a book I read called Limitless by _NAME_ and it‚Äôs basically how to keep your brain healthy what you can do to keep it functioning good. He mentioned some of the foods to eat which are brain healthy and dark chocolate was one of the foods he mentioned. Since then I‚Äôve been eating 85% dark chocolate from Aldi. I eat a little bit before going to bed with warm almond milk. I don‚Äôt know if it is helping but I thought I include that into my routine.

176085234,Yeah same. It‚Äôs really frustrating because it often stops me from watching things. Now I‚Äôm at the point where people won‚Äôt even talk to me about movies or shows much because they know I don‚Äôt watch. It really feels like I‚Äôm missing out on a chance to connect with people on something. I‚Äôve found that putting on closed captions or subtitles help a bit.
176085235,"Yeah, protein satisfies the body, and cuts out blood sugar spikes. Oddly enough cinnamon does that too. Just sprinkle a little bit on your food in the morning. Sugar has a tendency to spike your blood levels, so then you feel hungry soon after."
174363693,"Throughout my life, I‚Äôve taken a bunch of anti psychotics available to me for treatment of Schizophrenia. . Abilify, Geodon, Seroquel, Risperdal, Vraylar, Rexulti, Latuda, Fanapt, Zyprexa etc etc I‚Äôve taken everything. All these medicine have one thing in common for me. Seizure-Like Symptoms. I am currently taking Abilify 10mg for my treatment. It is the only medicine that I can take for 2 weeks without experiencing seizure-like symptoms and I have to stop taking it for like a few weeks or else I would have the seizures. Geodon being the fastest one that can induce seizures in a matter of 2 days. A description of the symptoms would be that the seizure mainly affects the eyes along with impaired cognitive functions and brain functioning. For example, my eyesight becomes disoriented and I can‚Äôt process what‚Äôs in front of me, like literally i can‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm seeing. As this is all going on with my eyes, I‚Äôm also really confused and can‚Äôt think straight as if I‚Äôm having a st
roke. If I‚Äôm in a conversation with someone while this seizure is happening, I can‚Äôt understand their speech and can barely give a response to it. My eyelids also twitch like crazy when I try to close them so I have to put my hands over my eyelids to make sure they‚Äôre not twitching rapidly. Another great example is when I‚Äôm running my usual route for exercise and bam, the seizures is happening, I literally don‚Äôt know where the heck I am and don‚Äôt know which direction to go as if I‚Äôve completely lost it. Does anyone have similar experiences as this?"

One I remember was when I was about 9 and I started to misbehave and my aunt‚Äôs friend worked in juvenile Hall and kept saying if I don‚Äôt calm down, I would end up there so I went nutzo and the both of them locked me in a closet for an hour, I was shouting, and pissed off because all I kept saying was your not my mom, and my mom wasnt there to stick up for me. I guess I was neurotic and didn‚Äôt like people I didn‚Äôt know would bang on the floor for them to leave, then as I reached adolescence friends told me I would get paranoid over things, and then when I had my first psychotic episode at 16 I thought I had esp or special powers that‚Äôs why I was on meds to calm down and get my thinking straight again. Didn‚Äôt know I had sz because I never met anyone with sz so therefore I didn‚Äôt know what it felt like. It wasn‚Äôt until 18-19 I started coming to terms that I was diagnosed with that after attending a partial ho
spitalization and still hardly knew anything about it or else I wouldn‚Äôt have tried going off my meds dozens of times or skipping months at a time. I never liked to listen to professionals when it came to meds because of the way the meds felt. They had more cons than pros"
176085248,I would suggest your tendency to overthink illness.

176085251,"I think social anxiety (and depression) gets the best of all of us sometimes. It tells us how much other people dislike us and how much we don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs good to let others know when you feel that way, because then they can tell you how much they really do care."
176085252,Ultimately it‚Äôs a bout function first. They put you on the meds for a reason. The chances of that clearing up isn‚Äôt unusual but stay on them for a while. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a couple of years and see how you go regardless and changing doses may be possible. Get to see your new doctor first. Your making assumptions about your treatment before it really happens but that is schizophrenia. Stay around here long enough you‚Äôll see that medication compliance is one of the more serious issues. Too many people stuff up coming off meds. That isn‚Äôt good for anyone.
176085253,"on television. there are a lot of them, i briefly watched ‚Äòlaw and order‚Äô as well as ‚Äòwalker, texas ranger‚Äô when i was younger. my dad would watch them in the living room mostly and i subjected myself to it. i wonder if the protests will put an end to the cool cop persona portrayed on these shows. all my adult life, i‚Äôve always seen it as a bit of propaganda, but whatever, i don‚Äôt like them. notice they are all on the major networks. it‚Äôs like the least creative idea for a show you can have. people eat them up like singing competitions. and there is always a new one. but some people like them, mostly on tv. i watch news, cartoons, ancient aliens, and a bit of sports. i could probably get by without a tv, just fine."

174363688,I worked physical jobs while I wasn‚Äôt medicated. I don‚Äôt think I could do it now. I don‚Äôt have the drive to work that hard. I‚Äôd steer clear from restaurants. Some are busy and way to stressful for a schizophrenic person. I was looking into manufacturing or a driver job

176085264,My anxiety/panic attacks were worse as I got older. I used to cry a lot and have nervous breakdowns. I wish I can cry and become hysterical.
176085265,Hallucinations and delusions may be a part of the structure of how our mind thinks. This might require great creative thinking to understand. Maybe years.

176085269,"_AT_MENTION_ yes he did mention therapy. That I need to see a whole team of mental health professionals not just a pdoc. He didn‚Äôt change my meds but added a low dose of antidepressant. I think 10mg citalopram if I‚Äôm not mistaken‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just a bit confused though about if it‚Äôs sza or sz. The borderline makes sense - and the sza as well, but when I asked him about the short hypomanias I get, he said they don‚Äôt qualify for hypomania episodes. So is it sz instead of sza?.. But anyway‚Ä¶ will hear from state pdocs. Maybe still sza because I had major depression before a lot. That lasted for months sometimes."
176085270,Thank you for your detailed explanation my friend I will follow this.

176085273,"_AT_MENTION_, All my life I have been very, very unlucky in love. I even had a psychic tell me I was unlucky in love once. I agreed with her. How did she know? Everyone I have ever felt attraction toward has not felt the same toward me and vice versa. Every time. So, I have always had to settle for dating people I felt no attraction for. It wasn‚Äôt until my older age that I finally got smart and quit dating. So, no, it‚Äôs not necessarily any easier for women."

Life has always been hard but before I was diagnosed I had hope if circumstances were just right I‚Äôd get to know what it‚Äôs like to enjoy life instead of being scared all the time. I get caught up in being hopeless and soo fun mad. I never even stood a chance at happiness. That‚Äôs when _PERSON_ head butts me and demands petting.

176085325,You may try modafinil for staying awake. But it worsens psychosis in some people. Prozac is activating as well. Bupropion will be the most activating and energizing. But don‚Äôt take Bupropion if you have history of seizures.

In summary - I am just throwing huge numbers of non-war people at the war situation. They will coordinate to stop it in millions of different ways although it is likely that a big crowd will form in Damascus and stop the war. Also because they are such a big number, it is the will of the people and democratic and legal. Thanks for the good question."

I ended up in these other virtual realities of hell like or worse existence. I sort of want to be believed, but then I don‚Äôt. I also thought I created Bitcoin. I mean how is this even possible? I think it was over many lifetimes and multiple lives. I also thought I was an alien or android among other things like I escaped my tormented reality and Jesus saved me. In my past lives, bad stuff happened to me and my family died too. I guess everything is good and okay now because of God a

Sort of like a house of horrors or something. We live in an artificial reality but at the same time I never accepted it or gave into it and went crazy. This has been going on for infinity. Think of an infinite sequence of numbers that never end. Most of the stuff I experienced was from ignorance, bad aliens, and what I learned above took millions of lifetimes to remember and figure out. There was a time when I had no memory or recall and I started remembering because they let me‚Ä¶remember. Thank you."

176085444,I think I had erotomania that started my psychosis. My boyfriend‚Äôs brother in law kept staring at me for a few years and I would hear his voice while he would look at me. I would constantly think he was in love with me. Because his voice kept saying it. I even thought I had a doctor that I thought liked me.

Im not at my sons school or internet sites with my personal information or with random new people. I speak publicly about psychosis and schizophrenia at work and my own experiences in this area, give presentations and talk to people. Sometimes there can be _USER_ID_ or difficult ideas. Yesterday one of the social workers who works with psychotic people admitted she wonders at times if it is demonic possession. Sometimes people talk about my back. It happens. Im okay with it, even if it hurts at times, it is worth it. I refused to go public with my story in front of a large public in a theater/concert show though. That felt too uncontrolled: I dont know who is watching. Internet feels the same."

176085467,Yes You are entitled to benefits if you can drive. I‚Äôve driven for years and been on benefits. The reason is I do not feel or function well enough to go work full time.
176085468,"Honestly, getting at least 14 hours of sleep every night does a lot for me. I know that is a lot, but I sleep uninterrupted. I also have headphones on If I have to go out and I almost always have music on at home. I don‚Äôt hear voices but I struggle with delusions a lot. So yeah, sleep and music help me cope with my SZ."

176085487,"I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm super anxious or I‚Äôm starting to go manic (despite the litihum) My mind won‚Äôt turn off, I can not sleep for the life of me tonight and it‚Äôs because my brain won‚Äôt turn off. When I lay down I‚Äôm overwhelmed with a million thoughts and obsessions and my mind goes in circles until I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. I shouldn‚Äôt be going manic because im on 6mg of Vraylar (which is anti-manic as well as anti-psychotic) as well as 900mg of Lithium but I suppose that is my worry. I hope it‚Äôs just anxiety."

176085492,"It‚Äôs common to me. A classmate had an operation to correct a crossed eye. My sister wore glasses ever since she was two years old to correct hers. Mother was always after her if her eye started to turn a little. My father‚Äôs childhood pictures showed him with crossed eyes. I was under such pressure not to have crossed eyes because of my vain, cold mother that every time I felt my eye turn in which felt better, I would straighten it out. That might have been why I hallucinated. I am working on this now. But, to answer your question, my mother was psychotic and did not have to have a reason to reject me other than the fact that children are a lot of worry and a lot of work - work that didn‚Äôt interest her. Rejecting me felt good to her."

176085494,What were your symptoms of psychosis? Any racing intrusive thoughts?
174363764,Depression and schizophrenia both can cause negative symptoms. Depression negative symptoms respond to meds but sz negative symptoms rarely respond to meds. Nothing worked for my negative symptoms while avoiding positive symptoms. I get lower negative symptoms on lower AP dose or when unmedicated but I also get positive symptoms which are worse than negative symptoms.

174363772,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Core Deficit of Classical Schizophrenia: Implications for Predicting the Functional Outcome of Psychotic Illness and Developing Effective Treatments. PF Liddle, Canadian journal of psychiatry. Revue canadienne de psychiatrie , Aug 21 2019 Many people suffering from psychotic illnesses experience persisting impairment of occupational and social function. Evidence assembled since the classical description of schizophrenia over a century ago indicates that both disorganization and impoverishment of mental activity are associated with persisting impairment. Longitudinal studies of young people at risk of schizophrenia reveal that both mental impoverishment and disorganization predict poor long-term outcome. These clinical features are related to cognitive impairments. Evidence from brain imaging indicates overlap in the brain abnormalities implicated in these phenomena, including impaired function of long-range connections between sensory cortex and the salience network, a network 
engaged in recruiting cerebral systems for processing of information salient to current circumstances. The evidence suggests that the common features underlying these two groups of symptoms might reflect a core pathological process distinguishing nonaffective from affective psychosis. This pathological process might therefore justifiably be designated the ""core deficit"" of classical schizophrenia. To develop more effective treatments to prevent persisting disability, we require the ability to identify individuals at risk at an early stage. Recent studies provide pointers toward effective strategies for identifying cases at risk of poor outcome. Accumulating evidence confirms that appreciable potential for neuroplastic change in the brain persists into adult life. Furthermore, brain function can be enhanced by targeted neuromodulation treatments. We now have promising tools not only for investigating the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie persisting functional impairment but also for identifyi
ng individuals at risk and for harnessing brain plasticity to improve treatment."

No crisis intervention plan. So what should I do if I am having symptoms? My online therapist asked me to come up with a plan with my psychiatrist to where if Prozac was making me manic or worse what to do. I basically have no direct way to contact that person other than leaving a voicemail with the case manager. Sometimes they don‚Äôt return the calls. At one point the entire phone system was down for two days. I know they‚Äôre trying to improve it and going through management changes but this place needs serious improvement, if not could be going out of business. I‚Äôm feeling a bit stressed out about f

I‚Äôm frustrated. I don‚Äôt trust the system. It‚Äôs a complete joke. I just want to have my own car, my own space, my own life, my own mind. The walls are closing in around me. My freedoms are slowly disappearing further and further as I willingly submit myself to the almighty machine. And to be fair, I was working 40 hours a week night shift with only 10 min breaks so that was hard labor. Not all jobs are that stressful!! I am tired of being given the worst possible options. My family has no faith in me. My mom does, but she‚Äôs s

It‚Äôs more like a welfare trap than an opportunity to succeed or anything. Should I just cancel the hearing and give up? I have no idea of how I‚Äôm going to manage to get out with NO ONE WILLING to help me, and a ten minute conversation with a gov. contractor psychiatrist every three months on whether or not to take Prozac. I am being completely stifled in life. I think I‚Äôm going back to my hippie ways, I‚Äôm going to stop going to IOP, stop doing the program, stop wasting time and find a job or learn to network‚Ä¶or come up with an idea for something I can do from home or my computer‚Ä¶or enroll in course-era and actually finish a course instead of doubt myself like my parents and fam. does."

This was an old school 80 year old psychiatrist who did psychotherapy too. This was contrary to when I was on acid and acting psychotic and my friend called me up and said YOUR EGO and I said I KNOW. and I think I‚Äôve told you that story but it was very damaging. And he did something damaging in my youth too to my ego that gave me grave difficulties. But when people tried to boost up my ego. Yes it can be repaired I believe. I think you can be as strong as you desire. Just gotta get that med situation in order so you don‚Äôt run out again lol. A healthy mind can be attained, I think that meds can do more than just bandaid with the right cocktail or whatever and with good therapy to accompany it. I think It‚Äôs important at first to have a doctor you can see monthly because if you see em less often you‚Äôre not getting to the root of the probl

176085633,Actually anything more than 2 pounds a week is proven to be unhealthy. You‚Äôd have to be in a 7000 calorie deficit per week to lose 2 pounds. That‚Äôs 1000 calorie deficit per day.

176085639,Were you ever psychotic before that?
176085640,Its in the normal range. You seen to misunderstand medicine. You either have normal or abnormal blood tests. You don‚Äôt need to be exactly in the middle of the normal range. Thats OCD.
176085641,Im medicated but still have some delusions from the past. Cant shake them off. And I think they want me to think im crazy thats why i still belive some things
176085642,"Oh interesting. I can‚Äôt take it for more than a few days either or I build a tolerance or have rebound insomnia when I do stop. I use it sparingly and only when I feel I really need it.

I used to be really really dull with music by playing melodies as nauseum(sp). Finally became passionate about the poetics the lyrics.

I‚Äôm tapering slowly I‚Äôll keep an eye on things and so will my dad I‚Äôm sure.
176085651,"I quit smoking, drinking, and drugs over 27 years ago. If I‚Äôm going to hell, it‚Äôs likely for how wretched of a person I used to be before AA helped repair me, I don‚Äôt think the smoking ever counted for much. Don‚Äôt know what percentage of SZs smoke other than a lot. We‚Äôre prone to addiciton issues."
176085652,"It took me ages to get over non-stopping, never ending, rejections. Now I don‚Äôt care either. On the brighter side, I went for a walk yesterday, and I spotted a deer just feet away from me as I circled a tree. In less than just 5 minutes later, I also spotted a rabbit. Both were located in the trees and bushes that are under a huge highway bridge that is just a stones throw away from the local houses."

176085656,"Talking about libido. I was born with almost no sex drive and always had friends as a child who talked of sex constantly. I started getting horney early in life, age 8, and developed a good libido as time went by. I lost it when I started taking meds for schizophrenia. I got it back from going off my meds for a month. I got a girlfriend and we had a lot of sex. We broke up a year and a half later because I wanted to study, and seek God. She wouldn‚Äôt ever give me time to myself! I decided to repress my desire and I haven‚Äôt had lust since. I regret I did this. My desire was love. I killed my romantic side. I am very lonely.

Emphysema killed my grandmother, but she smoked until the day she died. My emphysema seems to have gotten better some since I quit smoking."
174363806,"The idea that reality doesn‚Äôt exist until you observe it makes it hard to discern the objective world from the imagined world. Like, what if the imagined, schizophrenic world is a valid parallel reality that can be explored? I try not to think about it. I cherish objective, healthy reality too much than to try and search for meaning in the world with an injured, deluded mind that will probably end up chasing phantoms and demons."
174363810,"I know I would become irritable if i stopped working out or going out for walks. Or if I got in to a negative spiral of thoughts. I think irritability is a trait that every human has.

176085672,That sounds like good news!! A trick to calm the nerves is to tell yourself(and maybe tell your interviewer?) is that you will prove yourself at the job. They already know that ‚Äòeveryday is an interview‚Äô‚Ä¶ but saying it to yourself in these ways can help poke holes in the anxiety at present and distribute that energy on all the days ahead for you on the new job?

174363830,"Ya I tried it. It‚Äôs worth a shot if your insurance covers it. I quit after a month due to paranoia I think. But then again I have my theories like poor choices in life, not high enough dose, and stuff. It‚Äôs a nice med because I ate half as much or less, and no side effects really except tiredness in the morning. It‚Äôs stronger than Latuda for sure. It also put a dent into my delusions, but I prefer Vraylar. I think I want to do Vraylar + Caplyta or try Caplyta again. I‚Äôm 279 lbs. My normal weight 10 years ago before schizophrenia was 170-180 lbs."
176085694,"Yeah, I experience this‚Ä¶I fell ashamed what I did while I was in psychosis. I once felt a girl‚Äôs butt in a book store, and had to go to court. but I got a prayer of judgement wich I think is better than a misdemeanor‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt blame myself, because I was completely delusional. A voice told me to, and I thought it was God. The voices also told me she wouldn‚Äôt feel it."
176085695,"i don‚Äôt know where to start, but i wish to tell you quite a number of things for you to understand somethings here. loving people includes loving YOURSELF which not only others, as well as your own self. what you feel is what you feel, it is real but that doesn‚Äôt mean it reflects the real truths at hand. it‚Äôs ok to be emotional yet rational, both are true and real, and totally ok to be with at the same time. from my religion‚Äôs bible (i am a christian) stated that, ‚Äúdo onto others what you want others to do onto you‚Äù, which is true, but you missed out something for your part, which is ,"" do not expect what you did onto others, that they would do onto you"". many in this world lived by SUBJECTIVE truths, they do not care about OBJECTIVE truths. they believed those events before their very eyes and ears yet they do not question the real truths. even if you described it till the most fullest context and lively of whatever you want to tell them, in their minds they just don‚Äôt accept, they 
reject truths. what they FELT like it‚Äôs true, will be TRUTH to them, they will never accept REAL truths. horrible truths and cruel truths are so hard to accept that the devil was created so that people can live with easy lies, because this lies are easy to accept. so watch how these people that rejected truths (valid for your case now) and let them continue to live with lies, because they are destined to befriend lies and the devil and are far from the real truths. if you tried to save them, you will also be pulled in. so let them die spiritually with your eyes opened wided with heart harden take for these people. they deserve what they are doing for they reap what they sow. an analogy would be, the more you try to save people from drowning and doesn‚Äôt wish to grab onto the Life buoy with you swimming and aiding them yet they still wished to be drowned. you yourself would also be drowned just because your wishful thinking of helping someone that can‚Äôt be helped or doesn‚Äôt wished to help himself. you d
id you part and gave them the chance, so you are blameless. just move on and find people that clicks with you, people who CORRECTS you yet not CHANGES you. if you love someone that doesn‚Äôt deserved your love, then you would be the one who suffers, and no matter how much you tell the other party how much you love them, they would not believe and they would always question you, doubt you, test you, challenged you, which makes you feels even worst. so, my solution is to leave this kind of people as they are, for they are hopeless and destined to perish. hope this helps to a certain extent , and lastly for all viewers, these words are for cigarino‚Äôs case, please do not totally accept this as this is case to case basis. _NAME_ a.k.a lordarous"

A classic example is giving into doing something sexually amoral, even if it‚Äôs just a thought, when there is another part of the brain that is telling you that it is wrong and ultimatly bad for you. It‚Äôs really hard to always go for the good choices. The cartoons are true, it‚Äôs like we go through life with a devil on one shoulder and a angel on the other whispering into our ears. But it is possible to ignore the bad thoughts, it just takes a lot of practice and a dose of willpower."

LKM may have potential for reducing negative symptoms such as anhedonia, avolition, and asociality while enhancing factors consistent with psychological recovery such as hope and purpose in life. Case studies will illustrate how to conduct this group treatment with clients with negative symptoms, the potential benefits to the client, and difficulties that may arise. Although LKM requires further empirical support, it promises to be an important intervention since there are few treatments for clients afflicted with negative symptoms."

174363842,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Real-time fMRI neurofeedback reduces auditory hallucinations and modulates resting state connectivity of involved brain regions: Part 2: Default mode network -preliminary evidence. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, CL Angeles, _NAME_, EC _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research, Jan 2020 14 Auditory hallucinations (AHs) are one of the most distressing symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) and are often resistant to medication. Imaging studies of individuals with SZ show hyperactivation of the default mode network (DMN) and the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Studies in SZ show DMN hyperconnectivity and reduced anticorrelation between DMN and the central executive network (CEN). DMN hyperconnectivity has been associated with positive symptoms such as AHs while reduced DMN anticorrelations with cognitive impairment. Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NFB) we trained SZ patients to modulate DMN and CEN networks. Meditation is effective in reducing 
AHs in SZ and to modulate brain network integration and increase DMN anticorrelations. Consequently, patients were provided with meditation strategies to enhance their abilities to modulate DMN/CEN. Results show a reduction of DMN hyperconnectivity and increase in DMNCEN anticorrelation. Furthermore, the change in individual DMN connectivity significantly correlated with reductions in AHs. This is the first time that meditation enhanced through rt-fMRI-NFB is used to reduce AHs in SZ. Moreover, it provides the first empirical evidence for a direct causal relation between meditation enhanced rt-fMRI-NFB modulation of DMNCEN activity and post-intervention modulation of resting state networks ensuing in reductions in frequency and severity of AHs."

176085827,I figure caffeine causes some of my problems especially energy drinks with all those extra ingredients. I drank several a day for years.

174363849,"Start experiencing schizophrenia really hard when I was 20. One day I accepted I had schizophrenia when I was 31 and I am 32. I got my voices issues solved with InVega sustenna injection monthly. But I still had catatonia issues. Before I thought I was being possessed by the devil or that I was being cursed by God so I couldn‚Äôt do the things I want with my life. I can‚Äôt move sometimes and I always can‚Äôt do certain activities so I thought I was possessed or that God was cursing me. This wasn‚Äôt true. I decided to believe there was a medical reason for what was happening thanks to God saving me from my beliefs and I began going to the neurologist for sleep apnea tests, MRIs and things like that. I began researching my symptoms and I began to narrow down what it could be. Once I was diagnosed with catatonia I began researching treatment This website suggested a few over the counter medications and I found that glycine is really good for treating catatonia (Although you have to take a lot of it)
. I also found out from just talking to people that valerian root which naturally acts like a Benzo type medication helps. For the past four months and 22 days valerian root has been helping my catatonia. It gets less and less effective though and it requires more and more for the valerian root to work. At first I was just using valerian root pills but then I bought the actual cut up raw valerian root and empty tea bags and drink the tea every four hours in order to function properly as I cannot control what I want to do and do it unless I take glycine or valerian root and even then it‚Äôs still very hard to be able to choose to do the things I need to do through out the day to function. Had I not found valerian root and glycine by visiting this website I would have not succeeded at work and school. But I‚Äôm full time work and full time school and around January 30th valerian root stopped working. Then I waited a couple of days and it worked a little but and works or does not work. I went to the psychiatrist 
and they subscribed me Valium (dazepam) and it only worked for five days before it stopped working. That means what the forum suggested worked longer than what the doctor gave me for it. I am now calling hospitals because the next stage for me is to get ECT electroconvulsive therapy. I am going to get the therapy and hopefully it stops my catatonia because I have a high activity life of full time work and school and if I can‚Äôt get a control of my actions I‚Äôll fail both work and school and have to quit. My 6 months review at work was one supervisor saying I was doing bad and the other saying I was doing a 6.5 out of ten and I could be doing way better if I could just stop pausing all activity because of catatonia and control my actions to do what I choose when I choose it instead of having to struggle to do every single choice I make. For now I have to take glycine every 3 hours in order to semi function. Does anyone have any advice for me?can anyone relate with me and my story? What medication do you take 
to treat your catatonia or catatonic schizophrenia as it‚Äôs called? Do you have anything to say that you think I need to hear? I try to discipline myself to go to the gym but my actions freeze while I‚Äôm at the gym and I can‚Äôt exercise anymore or I can‚Äôt go to the gym at all. I try to do talents like art or create music with instruments or write lyrics or write source code in my free time but when I choose to do those actions I get frozen and simply can‚Äôt do them. I make the choice but my body doesn‚Äôt do it. Or I do it for a while and then I feel weak and like I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore and I stop. Valerian root and glycine is what I take and then I‚Äôm able to do prolonged activities. But sometimes I can‚Äôt even do those things with the medicine. I‚Äôm familiar with the can‚Äôt go to school or work thing because I have a mental illness. So I‚Äôm fighting it as hard as I can everyday to try to succeed but I need different medication or hopefully ECT will help."

176085847,"All my life i worked in retail and i know what you mean. I mainly worked in fast food restaurants in UK and the rushes we were having were insane. Sometimes I was on a till and i was talking so much to the customers that my mouth turned into sand. I was sweating all day on a grill also and the worst part we had to do 2 hour reataurant cleaning afterwards. I only left the job because I relapsed and now working at a cafe, but due to covid its shut down and I live in a small town now. I would recommend some med switch maybe? If you are having panic attacks - depakote is great and works almost instantly, it has calm suithing effect. Also you could try SSRI OR SNRI that is mainly for anxiety and panic attacks but takes around couple of weeks to feel the effect. Also you can use xanax to use small dose before the shift for a short period of time."
176085848,"I blame the meds for my anhedonia and blunt feelings. I went off medication and fell into psychosis and manual of course it was great to feel great, be able to have sex again.

Forty-four patients who were evaluated more than twice and were above the mild severity category on the _NAME_ Program for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire (HPSVQ) were enrolled. The mean observation period was 492.5¬±350.1 days (median, 452 days). The mean total, physical, and emotional factor scores on the HPSVQ were significantly reduced from baseline to the final observations except for one item ""interference with life,"" which was not significantly reduced. Regarding the time-dependent longitudinal changes modeled using linear mixed-effect regression, the total and physical factor scores showed significant changes during the f

So due to this we either create good habits or bad habits and then we follow it daily. So the trick is manually make some good habits and force yourself to follow it daily. If not do we automatically start following bad habits. First start we few good habits. Then when feel comfortable with that add few more and this way slowly cultivate the good habits which will replace old bad habits.

176085955,I go through periods of time where I get little sleep because of bad dreams waking me up in an anxiety attack. I wake up in a terrible state an unable to calm myself. I use a medicine called prazosin to help me get through those periods of time. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem scary but my dreams are about losing my kids or letting my kids down in some way or not being able to protect them from some danger. I guess to me that‚Äôs the really scariest thing. Anyway one dream I had my son was just tiny and I saw him start to slide through these water slide tubes and I had to find an alternate route to get to him and it was convoluted and water was everywhere and I was afraid he would drown and at the end of the dream right before I woke up I got stuck in some small tubing and poked my head up and could see him above there but couldn‚Äôt get to him.

174363894,"I have mentioned that me AND my Nurse Practitioner decided it was a good idea to taper down slowly off my meds. So, _AT_MENTION_ it really hurt my feelings that you said I was non-compliant when she was fully supportive of this and was helping me through it every step of the way. I don‚Äôt think it is non-compliance if the doctor herself agreed with this. I tapered down the Invega Sustenna injection since June, then got on risperidone 4.5 mg, then tapered the risperidone down to 2.5 mg where I‚Äôm at right now. But when I was at 4.5 we added a drug called Vraylar, which is believed to reverse antipsychotic tolerance and withdrawal (dopamine supersensitivity, related to tardive dyskinesia which I have). It is a D3/D2 partial agonist, with preference for D3. I‚Äôm on 1.5 mg right now. I actually decided I wanted to just stay on that med at a low dose because I believe I was put on too high of a dose of risperidone/paliperidone in the past when 1 mg of risperidone used to work fine for me. My goal dos
e for the Vraylar is 3 mg. The reason why I want to stay on Vraylar is because it‚Äôs a DAMM MIRACLE DRUG!!! Part of my concern for being on antipsychotics was the long-term changes in the brain, but Vraylar, being a partial agonist, is safer because it stabilizes dopamine instead of blocking it. But I never thought I would ever find an antipsychotic that works as well as this with NO side effects. The most frustrating thing about anti-psychotics has been the fact that they make me lazy, stupid, kill my creativity and spirituality. But NOT this! It seriously is just so amazing. I feel like it actually ENHANCES my spirituality and creativity, and my thoughts are very sharp now. It works SO well for negative and cognitive symptoms. Up until we dropped the dose of the risperidone further, I felt completely healed and normal. But I am having rebound psychosis from dropping down on the risperidone, but my NP says this is just withdrawal effects and that we will go as slow as possible to stabilize. I REALLY like th
is lady. I‚Äôve had her for about two months, and she totally listens to me and acknowledges my perspective, and she is so educated about the science. My psychosis is actually being triggered by stressful home dysfunction. I moved away from my alcoholic mother and my twin brother who always fought with her to my dad‚Äôs house, but my dad is bipolar and unmedicated, his girlfriend is schizoaffective and unmedicated, and my dad beat me as a kid because of his issues. So it‚Äôs really hard living in this house too because I feel like I‚Äôm constantly re-traumatized. I don‚Äôt deserve this. I deserve a stable living situation. As some of you know, I am training to become a Catholic monk and could potentially move in to the monastery as early as February. But for now I‚Äôm going back to San _NAME_ to my mom‚Äôs house. I am terrified that the violence in the home will lead me to be hospitalized again, especially as I am so sensitive right now from tapering down the risperidone. I am going to ask my doctor if I can 
increase the Vraylar to 3 mg. I don‚Äôt know if I will ever get off the Vraylar, but if I did, it would be after exactly 3 years of stability, living in the monastery. Or perhaps after I finish seminary. Or maybe I‚Äôll just stay on it for life because it does really help me. Seeing how dysfunctional and miserable my dad and his girlfriend are (they both have PhDs and haven‚Äôt worked in several years because of it), who refuse to take meds, made me kind of realize that, hey, meds could seriously improve my quality of life, now that I have finally found the right med.

176086056,"I‚Äôm having a pretty good morning so far, aside from not really wanting to be awake this early. I woke up on my own (no alarm, I mean), and I was wide awake, not getting back to sleep anytime soon. Oh well, I‚Äôm trying to enjoy it. Right now I‚Äôm just sitting here with no music/headphones. I like how quiet it is right now. The main thing I hear are the dogs‚Äô footsteps above me. The girls are up too, but they‚Äôre playing on their tablets, so they‚Äôre not making much noise. It‚Äôs relatively peaceful here right now. I‚Äôm getting hungry, though."

176086058,"The doctor of my wife mentioned that recently that has been a new law passed in Washington State regarding getting a person into an ambulance and taken to hospital against their will. If I call an ambulance they are obligued to take the person you called the ambulance for if you say you‚Äôre a relative and state they need treatment. The doctor didn‚Äôt have a lot of detail and my memory is vague, but it was something along those lines. Does anybody happen to know what this new law is (seems like it came into effect sometime within the last year or so maybe), and where I can get more info on it from?"

I had a disc herniation when I was around 14-16 (can‚Äôt remember correctly) and it gradually went worse from there‚Ä¶ I was only diagnosed at age 23 so pretty recently. Actually there are forms of MD that show in adulthood. My parents thought I had conversion disorder. When I started to walk again after lots and lots of physiotherapy and ended up having a bunch of weird and unexplainable symptoms, they were like ‚Äúwtf‚Äù. They still believed that it was leftover symptom of conversion disorder so they just basically believed that I was just being emotionally weak."

174363906,Not really. Why is it a high hope if the same was achieved with Abilify lol Explain.
176086087,I take 200 mg per day for mood stabilization and migraines also. I have the option of adding more if it becomes necessary. I am unclear as to exactly how much more I would be able to take.

My pdoc and I were expecting that I would need to go to 20 mg since I was on 30 mg of Haldol and still having breakthrough symptoms, but we were pleasantly surprised that I am completely controlled on 7.5 mg. I think your increase will help you if you‚Äôre already getting good results on 10 mg. When I was on Haldol, I started at only 7.5 mg and then gradually made it up to 30. On Abilify, I started at 5 mg and ended up at 30. Only at 30 mg of Abilify did I stop having psychotic symptoms (I came off due to significant weight gain).

I have never asked for money from anyone except when I was in debt or broke. I live within my means generally speaking, but since having these desires I have started spending wildly, believing that money is meaningless. Either I accept that I will have to budget because I can‚Äôt afford these things, or I accept that these things will come to me as grants to my wishes, but this is a false dichotomy, because money is finite. The nature of money is that it is finite, created yes, but finite nevertheless, thus one always has to budget. Creations cannot create anything, only the uncreated can give rise to creation, potential leading to manifestation. How can I budget for what

176086236,Not only that but people I know or met before. It messes you up. I theorize that the disease took over the part of our memories of other people‚Äôs voices and uses them against us. Since it is a part of our brain why can‚Äôt it take almost human characteristics? Here‚Äôs another unusual belief.

What is a more appropriate term for severely overweight than obese? What is a more appropriate term for people with mental health issues than mentally ill?

176086263,"I kinda get that. But it is not an ideal headspace. I feel SZ people follow two narratives, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù, objective one and the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù, unreal one. Subjectively, one is more important, but not willfully so much. There is a will factor but the psychological predisposition forces it towards the unreal narrative for SZ folk. I know those subjective, personal ‚Äúlessons‚Äù you receive have little relevance to others, nor can you even meaningfully relay them, or even journal them. I‚Äôm not saying they are bad, necessarily, but that there is a more optimized, less sensitive, more relatable way of living, when you resolve the underlying stressors with good treatment."

174363950,"I felt cured when I got my heart rate up, did intense cardio (relatively speaking), and stuff. It only lasted a short time, but even my psychiatrist said I could cure myself (severe DP/DR) if I took care of myself and exercised in an extreme manner and do it continuously for a few months (I think?). I don‚Äôt know if he was serious or if it was good or lawful advice, but it gave me hope. This is the same doctor who kept on pushing the paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis because I talked about not being real and living in the matrix. I believe now this was my response to being severely traumatized. This is the same doctor years later that gave me too many psychiatric meds and almost killed me. I guess he‚Äôs incompetent."

174363960,Its a weak AP i think thats why pdoc put you in that drug at first. When that fails he might try stronger ones. The problem with stronger APs is it can carry more side effects. In this regard your pdoc did a good thing to minimise as much side effects in this young age.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a completely different person and it makes me sad. I used to never write lists and now I live from list and my calendar so I don‚Äôt forget things. My kids have to remind me to make dentist appointments and pick up stuff for them where as before I was on top of it. Luckily I had them young so they‚Äôve been teens this whole time but it still makes me feel bad as a mom. It just makes me sad some days.

Instead I saw two c 1998 and in 2002 who adopted a ‚ÄòIf you want to be a good person‚Ä¶‚Äô approach as though I was a moral degenerate. Needless to say they got dumped rather quickly.

I don‚Äôt tolerate Haldol well, so those years were a misery for me. The decanoate shot generally gave me a lesser dose than taking Haldol orally. When I was taking 40 mg daily in tablet form it was utter misery. Just about all the typical antipsychotics make me miserable. When they first started me on the shot I was getting 150 mg a month. That comes out to roughly 5 mg a day, so it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the decanoate shot. They lessened my dose over the years, until I was taking about 100 mg a month.

176086419,"It was very informal, but I think we had a house meeting about once a month or every two months. I wouldn‚Äôt call it group therapy, it was just airing grievances and miscellaneous stuff like requesting certain foods or asking questions. There was really no official therapy going on, it was more like just the counselors and clients hanging out in the kitchen and bull*hitting with each other. Everybody was kind of friends and at least two counselors were there 24/7. It was easy to go into a room alone with a counselor if you wanted a private one-on-one. But like I said, the staff wasn‚Äôt hired for their psychiatric experience, they were there because they wanted to help people and they would talk to you if you felt like talking. It was so informal that both staff and clients were almost peers. It wasn‚Äôt like some group homes I‚Äôve been in where staff kind of have this exalted status and their apart from the residents or ‚Äúabove‚Äù the residents. The staff at Soteria were just young people hangi
ng out with us. When I first got there a woman staff member used to lend me her car. She took me to her house a few times and I drove another client to an appointment once. Another counselor took me jogging with him. I walked to the store with other counselors and a couple times I walked down to the park with this gorgeous German woman staff member and we played tennis. Wow, she was hot! But we all ate together, watched TV together etc. If you wanted to talk one-on-one it was easy; all you had to do was ask."

176086491,"Don‚Äôt feel bad. I think we all get frustrated with the meds and want to quit or reduce sometimes. You had enough good sense to get back on your previous dose when you got symptoms. That‚Äôs good. In the future, if you want to reduce the meds, just make a plan with your doctor and do it slowly. Also, have you tried calorie counting with an app? It‚Äôs a lot simpler than doing it manually."
176086492,"Okay. It‚Äôs your call. I figure if you‚Äôre going to master something, at least aim for the heights. Otherwise you might have regrets. But maybe not, at the same time, if you are content.

174364035,"https://www.mentalhelp.net/schizophrenia/disorganized-dimension/ Positive Symptoms: The Disorganized Dimension Disorganized thinking becomes apparent in patients‚Äô speech patterns as schizophrenia progresses. Affected people lose their train of thought during conversations, make loose associations of topics (tangentially jumping from one topic to another apparently at random, or on the barest of associations), and give answers to unrelated questions. Speech may be highly circumstantial, meaning that affected people may speak continuously, providing numerous irrelevant details and never getting to the point. Occasionally, speech is so disorganized that it becomes a completely jumbled ‚Äúword salad‚Äù devoid of discernible meaning despite being full of words. Disorganized behavior may range from simple problems sustaining goal-directed self-care behaviors such as personal hygiene to unpredictable and bizarre socially inappropriate outbursts. For example, people may not dress according to the weather
, (i.e., they may wear a heavy coat in the middle of summer), they may wear odd or inappropriate makeup, they may shout at people for no apparent reason, or they may mutter to themselves continuously, etc. They may even strip off their clothing and run naked through the streets, while chewing on road kill. Most anything is possible. Catatonic motor behaviors are a type of disturbed behavior (and a negative as opposed to a positive symptom) that sometimes occurs when schizophrenia goes untreated. In catatonia, peoples‚Äô reaction to their surroundings becomes remarkably decreased. They may assume a rigid, uncomfortable looking posture and then not move for hours or days, resisting efforts to move them. Catatonic patients may also display ‚Äúwaxy flexibility‚Äù, meaning that they allow themselves to be moved into new positions, but do not move on their own. Most of the time, this is not an act or a show but rather a genuine and unpremeditated symptom of the illness that patients cannot help. Catatonia is observ
ed with less frequency today than in past years due to advances in treating schizophrenia. Negative Symptoms: Affective Flattening, Alogia, and Avolition ‚ÄúAffect‚Äù refers to emotional expression. Affective flattening, distinguished by a restricted range of expressed emotions, is a fairly common negative symptom among some schizophrenia patients. Patients with affective flattening show relatively immobile and unresponsive facial expressions, often accompanied by poor eye contact and little body language or movement. Alogia refers to difficulty with speaking. In some schizophrenic patients, alogia manifests as reduced total speech output, and reduced verbal fluency (the ease with which words are chosen). Patients displaying alogia struggle to give brief answers to questions, for example. Avolition describes a loss of motivation; the will or desire to participate in activities or to do things. Some schizophrenic patients show avolition in that they will sit still for long periods of time, seemingly indifferen
t to their surroundings, and without displaying any interest in work or social activities. In extreme cases, this behavior becomes catatonia (as described above)."

I dont know how to explain it though. It‚Äôs weird. So in order to bypass that I will often times stay up until I‚Äôm so tired that if I close my eyes I pass out within a minute or two. Which is admittedly not the best strategy but that‚Äôs how I get to sleep again after a dream. Even of I get up they just stay stuck in my head. _AT_MENTION_ I know I have pleasant dreams sometimes but I rarely remember them. I have my giraffe stuffy that I‚Äôve had since I was a baby. Sometimes it helps. Tonight I‚Äôm gonna go over boyfriends house and try to sleep there for a little bit. He helps me sleep. And I know he can calm me down if I wake up from a nightmare.

It came out that psychiatrical patients did mostly sports as everybody else, but many disliked going there with public transport. Then I got hired as a researcher for almost two years. I wrote a book about a small psychiatrical clinic (22 beds) from the point of view of the inpatients. Also I wrote a report on the communication of a mental health organization (n=200). And I wrote a report about the same mental health organization and their intake (n=300). Then working as a volunteer I did a SROI (Social Return of Investment) analysis of the Fountainhouse Amsterdam. I had to write this report in English which is not my native language. And still working as a volunteer I did research into the oral health of psychiatrical patients of a mental health organization (Mentrum Arkin). The reason for this research was that

I am in the process of gaining things too, such as a sense of what is important to me and the power to stand up for that, a capability to appreciate things of real value, insight into myself, skills to open up and be vulnerable to the right people, etc. And i am rebuilding a few relationships, such as with my kid and father.

174364062,"Sometimes it‚Äôs a long journey _AT_MENTION_ out of the hell that can be living with schizophrenia. Once I was diagnosed and treated with medication it took three years for my hallucinations and delusions to become washed away. Then it was all about living with negative and cognitive symptoms‚Ä¶ challenges that can‚Äôt be medicated away but instead must be understood, accepted, and then walked over like paving stones somewhere to whatever extent possible. I‚Äôve been walking on paving stones now for a little over ten years but I‚Äôm making headway. I‚Äôve learned that‚Ä¶ Insight leads to treatment. Treatment leads to stability. Stability leads to self discovery. And self discovery leads to wellness. You don‚Äôt have to reach the end goal of wellness to be accepted.

174364090,I didn‚Äôt hallucinate before I was prescribed antipsychotics but when I quit them the last time I hallucinated like a champ. One of my theories was that my psychiatrist had either given me LSD or quitting antipsychotics made me more psychotic. In hindsight I realize I was already schizophrenic when I started taking them but when I stopped it certainly got much worse. Anything is possible. I had negatives before I started APs though. I don‚Äôt think they make me worse.

I missed my 3 mg dose a few times in the past and noticed that I could focus better during the time periods of it wearing off. On another occasion, I accidentally doubled the 3 mg dose and as a result seemed to finish tasks slower. My psychiatrist tried to cross taper my AP to Ability/Aripiprazole, but it gave me side effects of earaches and anger, so I went back to Risperdal. Although I have side effects from taking Risperdal, other than cognitive ones, which include weight gain and oversleeping, the tablet seems to be helping me with my paranoia, anxiety, and lack of sleep. I might consider switching to Latuda/Lurasidone, as suggested by my psychiatrist, but I fear that it may not be effective as Risperdal with my symptoms. I do not want to end up with insomnia or extrapyramidal symptoms as a result of trying Latuda. Should I switch to it?"

If it works in people, how long will it be available as a cheap over the counter drug, I wonder. It has been proposed as an additional therapy for schizophrenia (not a replacement for antipsychotics) because of its effects on myelin. Frontiers Confused Connections? Targeting White Matter to Address Treatment Resistant... Despite development of comprehensive approaches to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and improve outcomes, there remains a proportion (approximately one-third) of patients who are treatment resistant and will not have remission of... Based on the literature reviewed here, there are WM deficits that correlate with treatment resistance in schizophrenia. While other mechanisms of pharmacoresistance are s

In fact, myelin enhancing strategies have been under investigation in human subjects for many years as effective treatments for multiple sclerosis are sought. Thus, repurposing and investigating these approved therapeutics currently in use for other medical conditions for treatment resistant patients is a reasonable approach. More specifically, putative myelinenhancing therapies would be potential candidates for large-scale clinical trials in schizophrenia. These include myelin-enhancing agents such as n-3 PUFA, minocycline , clemastine, polyphenols and potential neuro/myeloreparative agents such as sulfasalazine, nano-curcumin, stem cell enhancing therapies such as Gli-1 inhibitors, immunodmodulators such as fingolimod, olexosime and retinoid receptor activators such as pioglitazone."

When I moved to corn country in the Midwest, USA, the pdoc at the VA there took me off of all my meds and started over clean slate. He put me on Risperdal, Depakote and Serzone. My suicidality immediately improved but it didn‚Äôt disappear. A new pdoc took me off Depakote and started Tegretol. All my depression and suicidality suddenly vanished for good. Now, all that was left was my psychosis. I experienced hallucinations in all sensory spheres, paranoid, grandiose and religious delusions, delusions of reference, delusions of control, thought insertions, thought broadcasting and telepathy. My pdoc put me on Risperdal Consta and combined it with two other AP‚Äôs Geodon and Seroquel, along with an AD Celexa. And that did the trick. I was free of psychosis as well as depr

176086944,"I have a story and a question. I was talking to a friend about the various ways you can be committed to a psych ward in Denmark, and we were talking about red papers. Red papers are when you‚Äôre rabidly psychotic or a danger to yourself or others, and it‚Äôs always involuntary. I said ‚Äúthank god that‚Äôs never happened‚Äù and he said it had and asked if I remembered ‚Äúthe couch incident‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt, so he told me the following story: 3-4 years ago, I visited him like I always did. Everything was fine, he went to the kitchen to cook us dinner. A while later I came running into the kitchen, seeming very agitated with a panicked look in my eyes he says I only have during psychosis. I was ranting incoherently about how his couch was trying to murder me, and getting agitated that he wouldn‚Äôt help keep me safe from it. He knew something was very wrong, and the procedure to have someone committed on red papers in Denmark is to call the cops and have them escort the person to the nearest psych war
d. However, the cops don‚Äôt have much resources, so they didn‚Äôt have the time. He had to get a friend of ours to come over and sit with me in the back of his car so I wouldn‚Äôt open the car door and barrel roll onto the freeway. When we got to the hospital, things were so bad they were thinking of putting me in belt restraints, but decided to try some sort of drug first. It knoced me the F out and I slept 15 hours straight. I was in a high security ward for two weeks before I was somewhat coherent again, and they had to have someone have me in their eyesight at all times. As in, the door to my room was never closed and there was a nurse assigned for the sole purpose of sitting outside my door and keeping an eye on me. I do not remember it at all. I don‚Äôt even have a feeling I‚Äôve lost any time. I don‚Äôt remember being in the ward, I don‚Äôt remember being scared of the couch, nothing. And this friend used a special code word when telling me, that we only use when we want to make it absolutely clear we 
are 100% telling the truth. None of us would even think of abusing it, and it is only for special cases. So my question is: can a psychotic episode like this trigger complete amnesia?"
176086945,"I think my sister is making porn, i feel a bit crap about it bc i never thought she would do that, shows what i know, she has been running ‚Äòswingers parties‚Äô for a while now and almost got into trouble with police, she basically admitted to it today, I dont really want to know about it but i just asked her if she is a hooker and she said no but the guy she kicks about with has been working on his own website and i said as a joke ‚Äòits not porn is it?‚Äô and the rest is history, just hope i don‚Äôt see any of that crap at any time in my life it would make me feel really bad and weird if i saw that."

176086981,Everyone seems to be different. Some people can go a day without their med and be fine.

176087034,"It really pays to get along with both halves of the population. I admit I got mad at women sometimes in high school because they ignored me and pursued my better looking friends. But it hurt my feelings more than anything else. It took me awhile to get perspective and realize that both sexes are superficial when they are young and I can understand now why I got passed by. I got over it though. But I was eventually lucky enough to be able to talk to women as I got older and forget about my impossible dream to be a ‚Äúplayer‚Äù with women. I carried that delusion for quite awhile. And I dated some nice women and hung out with my friends and their girlfriends and I have to admit that my occasional luck with women in my twenties was mainly bolstered by the false courage cocaine gave me. But at the time, I would take courage anyway I could get it, lol, because false or not, I got to rack up a few memories with some women. Now I‚Äôm 58 and things have calmed down and my interaction with women is just fri
endly talk if they want to. I still admire a good figure and beauty because I got eyes! But now my biggest thrill with women is occasionally imparting a little wisdom or making them laugh. I make both the men and women at work laugh and like talking to both. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have one more one night stand left in me, but I don‚Äôt actively pursue it though I‚Äôve been thinking about it more lately.

The message that got me banned was a result of confusing four Greek men I know, and believing that they were all a single person from Cuba, a Taino (indigenous) who could shapeshift and had vastly different experience from Greek people. This didn‚Äôt bother me, it is nice to meet people with vastly different experiences when everyone is civil, but it can cause problems, especially if love is not balanced. What particularly bothered me is that my university friend had been sleeping with one of the Greek men I had rolled into one before she became psychotic. I don‚Äôt blame the Greek man, I know he was trying to help her, but I did get angry when I confused all four Greek men because at that point I thought that the four‚Äôs single actions were one‚Äôs of 
imperialism, not solidarity. In a world of shapeshifters and illusionists, telling who someone is can be difficult, if you are worried about their actions, even more so with reading text, and particularly if the identities of the text writers are being shuffled and disguised. I actually thought my good friend _AT_MENTION_ was one and the same as the four Greek men I had rolled into one as well, Hence I wrote to him a message of forgiveness and a challenge of respect, I realise now this came from delusions, I hope that explains my actions, Thank you. _AT_MENTION_"

176087163,"Hello, I am new to the Community. I am struggling immensely with my mental health and with the way I was raised. I was raised in an abusive household, I was a victim of sexual assault at Church as a child for a few years, and all around my self esteem and self love were stripped from me as a child. As an adult I suffer with Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and PTSD. I am considerably high functioning with the issues that I have, but, I still retain the inability to love myself and my self esteem is still incredibly low. This causes insecurities that blend with my psychosis and make relationships incredibly difficult. Recently my fiancee left me during my psychosis and her reasoning is that until I learn to love myself I can never truly love anyone. I desperately want to fix this about myself. I want my family back and to not be alone. I just don‚Äôt understand the process of self love. I cannot fathom anything good about me. Please, if anyone can help me reach out. I have been progressively more an

174364202,"I really don‚Äôt mind who knows that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2016 because Four years later I have my schizophrenia under absolute 100% control and I don‚Äôt think I have EVER felt more in love with who I am than I do today and I‚Äôd say the main reason for that is that my schizophrenia diagnosis forced me into intense therapeutic situations involving classrooms full of others suffering not just like me but suffering just the same. I was FORCED to sit for an hour a week talking to a bland woman that I did not like one bit. She had little to say but ‚ÄúTry DBT‚Äù (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) which I ended up being forced into anyway when I got caught drinking on probation. I‚Äôve peed in a cup far, far, FAR too many times for me care anymore and yet still I did. Every damn time I had to do it I felt humiliated and those ladies who have to watch you pee, while they are wearing gloves it is still disgusting to have to spend the morning smelling the pee of 100 other people and having t
o handle it‚Ä¶ ew. I was FORCED out of my nearly 10 year hibernation with my voices because my voices literally overnight turned from angels & Gods speaking of life, love & all things good about the universe (Let me repeat that this change literally happened over the course of a single day. I knew I was schizophrenic the moment I heard the 1st voice back in 2008 but it said ‚ÄúTurn left‚Äù while I was walking around Oak Lake by myself and no one anywhere near me. I can‚Äôt explain why I chose to follow but I did indeed turn left and I can explain the magically warm and tingling sensation that over came my whole body, mind & soul it felt the moment I turned left. That‚Äôs how I felt with my voices from 2008-2016 and it was incredible! I felt like I was talking to the Gods because the voices were NEVER anything negative for eight blissful years.) Suddenly, on 4/20/2016 I woke up to a voice I was VERY familiar with for about the past four years. He started getting pushy in his instruction meaning NEVER in my sch
izophrenic past or present do I EVER feel compelled to do anything more than simply talk to my voices (which I still get despite medication to this day) because never since that first day have I been instructed by them. They just talked and I just listened and sometimes talked back when I was alone but never in front of anyone. I heard literally hundreds of voices and was able to hide it from _NAME_ although near the end he suspected something was wrong but he incorrectly thought I was abusing massive amounts of drugs and alcohol and that was the reason for my erratic behavior. 2016 started and ended with me in the loving arms of my husband and children but April to August was probably the worst & best months of my entire life. I was homeless on the streets of _NAME_, Nebraska for the month of June while I waited for a bed to open up in the People‚Äôs City Mission and spent another month in a room with 20 other women. I don‚Äôt want to talk about how it happened right now and you‚Äôll see why in a minute. The 
short version is the voices became pushy and I had multiple miniature blackouts over the course of the day once while driving which scared me but at the time I didn‚Äôt realize that anything was changing because it was happening so fast that I just thought I was having a really REALY bad day. I spent the entire day avoiding everyone and everything which only made things about 1,000 times worse because apparently socialization‚Ä¶ true socializing where you put down your phone, look each other in the eye, and have a heart felt conversation about anything that floats your boat as long as you stay 100% connected with the person you are communicating with‚Ä¶ it truly helps. But I secluded myself and for the first time in all my years of working no call, no showed at work leaving my elderly charge to have to call for someone else to come get him out of his wheelchair and into bed for the night. That‚Äôs the last thing I remember about that night with absolute clarity. From that moment on I was at the whim of this v
oice who once was kind, funny & charming but was now not so kind. I woke up from a dream involving _NAME_ doing some of the most terrible things imaginable and I can remember waking up SUPER angry because the emotions of my dream had not yet subsided and just like that morning when I woke up the first voice that I heard was not my sweet husband‚Äôs but none other than Lucifer himself. It isn‚Äôt fair to be possessed by a demon and that is exactly what it felt like. I felt like a puppeteer had the strings to my body and brain and someone else with sinister intentions had the controls because everyone who knows me knows that I am not now nor have I EVER been a violent or aggressive person but something in me snapped that day and for a really long time I was not right with myself which meant I was not right for anyone else including my husband & children. I can‚Äôt say that I shouldn‚Äôt have been punished for what I did that night but the city of _NAME_, Nebraska can‚Äôt even begin to understand the severity of 
the punishment I ultimately recieved for going into a schizophrenic blackout and punching my poor husband right in the mouth. I should have been put in a hospital and instead was thrown in jail where I recieved no help whatsoever no matter how many days in a row I told them that I needed to see a doctor. When my sister bailed me out being with family helped some but I freaked out on her and scared her so bad that she kicked me out. I didn‚Äôt want to burden anyone else and didn‚Äôt even think that I HAD anyone else so I wandered the streets of _NAME_ for three whole days and nights before I became vaguely aware that lack of sleep was causing me to hallucinate but I didn‚Äôt have a bed and it was the first time in my life that I didn‚Äôt have a bed so I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was walking nonstop and had huge blisters across the entire pads of my feet because I just didnt know what else to do besides walk. I sat down on the front steps to an apartment building and the next thing I knew it was night. I don‚
Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get to the hospital because I knew I needed help. I think I was scared to lose the only entities that I had left to interact with even if they were imagined. I did eventually get to the hospital where I was immediately diagnosed and medicated. I‚Äôve spent the last three years recovering from being ripped away from the only family or friends I had in my life at the time. I was completely alone and had no means to provide for ANY of my own needs and had no one to protect and provide for me. In any case I got home and while I had my husband and children and less voices I truly felt that I had no friends. I did it to myself beginning when I dropped my whole of everything here in _NAME_, Nebraska to spend six years raising children alone with no friends or family because I was so crazy busy raising babies and loving my husband during the few moments here and there that he wasn‚Äôt deployed that I had time enough to make maybe three good friends that I still have to this day and two of thos
e were _NAME_‚Äôs friends. I just don‚Äôt find people quickly or easily. Well about a year ago I decided that I am not letting myself be alone anymore. If I like you and think that you are a good person, I want to spend more time with you. I apologize to the people that I know I am going to ghost because I don‚Äôt want you in my life but it is my ??????? life not yours and if you want to spend ANY time in mine you should probably listen when I speak because I have been ignored in this world for far too ??????? long to want to play games with MY LIFE. I have spent 40 years being beat the ???? down and I have brought my own self back up all on my Goddamned own and I won‚Äôt have anyone else force me into such a submissive and unhappy state of mind for as long as I have the state of mind to fight of parasitic people‚Ä¶ parasitic entities‚Ä¶ parasitic f u c k I n g anyone or anything with nothing to offer and desires only ever to take. I just didn‚Äôt have it in my heart to love so hard anymore and that deeply sa
ddened me. I needed a severe and desperate change not in myself or how I behaved but in how other people behaved towards me. I need 100% beyond total acceptance of me for who I am in 2020 and I just happen to love everything about myself INCLUDING the fact that I am schizophrenic. I know it sounds crazy to say that I like being schizophrenic but here‚Äôs the deal. If I DON‚ÄôT love everything about myself including the schizophrenia I am depressed and beyond disappointed and completely unhappy. I am hopelessly interested in psychology and due to my diagnosis I am in a unique position where I can and am offering society one of the most intense submersions in to the mind of a schizophrenic that I can produce with the mind of a schizophrenic. I love the study of psychology and scores no less than an A+ in every psychology course that I took in college. I‚Äôm far from stupid and while I have absolutely no idea exactly what I am doing I know in my heart that while the road has been riddled with potholes and speed 
bumps that the end of that terribly abused and neglected road is right in front of me and I think I‚Äôm going to turn left."

176087213,"None of them make sense. In High school they hired a therapist to film me doing my homework. Every morning they would greet me with the strange blond haired lady who wanted to video tape me. They sent a letter to my parents asking for their permission. Eventually I dropped out, even though I was ahead in all my classes. They said I was failing because they stopped grading my papers and I just gave up, stopped writing assignments on the board. I had a psychic awakening, the one people talk about. I keep thinking about it. Its what really broke me, when I was baker acted after dropping out of high school. I was thinking about it all day actually. How there was a guy who had OCD who asked me about the Iraq war, and I thought was a government agent or undercover. How they switched the numbers to the room when I entered the building. It was almost like a staged event. When I stood up and tried to walk out, I was yelled at and told to ‚Äòsit back down!‚Äô in the cafe and eat my lunch. A man came through 
the same doors with a stretcher and like a drip attached to it, looked around, and almost angrily shrugged and left. They took my folder that I completed three times, after I was told I had to fill it out for an early release I filled them out and they were confiscated. My parents said I had a manic episode because I got upset and told my mom I was not crazy and she became hostile. They were trying to wipe out what they had been saying that I was worthless and crazy and belonged on the street. My parents like switches just turned evil. I was never doing anything, just watching tv or eating in my messy room. They weren‚Äôt homeschooling me after I dropped out of high school. I took the GED after I got out of the psych ward and turned eighteen. I just got the book and read a few pages and passed. In classes, no one told me when the whole school left and went to church. When I wrote answers to a pop quiz, everyone else‚Äôs answers were verbatim to mine but no one saw what i wrote and I guessed. It was like a was 
projecting my psychic abilities and things were going haywire and the masses fell asleep at the same time. I started hearing things no one else could hear, radio channels and subliminals messages in other languages, like at a mcdonalds I heard subliminals in chinese. I heard something about a Russian radio station in the airwaves through a plane in DC. It said, this is KMFDM radio. My ipod turned on later and said, ""Can you hear me‚Äô in a crisp male monotone voice or something and I knew it was the criminals. They finally stopped messing with me when some real life aliens and demons started coming out of it all. I think thats why I was left alone. So no I‚Äôm not kidding, my so called delusional paranormal experiences aren‚Äôt fixable by a pill or whitewashing. I have had some really fked up experiences related to the war, social activism, 911, and my parents role and their history and connections and this is how it all played out. I think also they thought my story about the Pandemic and New World Order I 
wrote in 2001 might be too controversial as it predicted things in the way 1984 does‚Ä¶no one even read it. No one even cares. Its not based on the past it was the past based on the future and I created the term RFID ink, and I came up with the endless tollbooths and the brainwashed citizens. It was meant to be science fiction, and then science fiction became reality."
176087214,It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to call and check the status of your application and ask for an estimate of how long before you hear anything about your claim.

So I have no options and I have had schizophrenia since fifteen. My dad won‚Äôt help with transportation, and it‚Äôs controlling toward me. I feel limited because I don‚Äôt want to sit around and do nothing, but no one is motivating me to try to do anything. My dad will only pay for one class of college per semester. No sense in doing this as this will not bring me to a full time job or help with that. Because I won‚Äôt have support in working. I guess the other option would be to apply for a tech college and work-study at the college while I do this one class. I don‚Äôt have enough work history to incur SSDI because I have only had three jobs, and before that I was working toward a four year degree and I wasn‚Äôt helped because I was in college. I think my Grant was screwed up because of the Pandemic and I missed the application dead
line for college classes. Also the Grant for classes only works for full time courses. So again I am dependent on my dad to pay for the one class. But my dad won‚Äôt give me any money for things, cant buy new clothes. I have like the same outfit for months. I kind of feel like I am being encouraged to become poor. I never wanted this.

176087226,"There is research to suggest that we sort of think in cartoon form, simplifying that which we see into caricatures. For example when people see a photo or a cartoon like caricature of the photo, the remember the latter better (_NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_,1974). This may because the line cartoon drawing is the way we cognise and store the photo anyway. Further, when we see faces flashed side by side simultaneously, they appear deformed and caricature-ised This may be because while we caricature-ise faces all the time, we only notice when we see two faces shown briefly side by side (_NAME_, 2011). So if illusions are uncontrolled, intrusive thoughts, then it is perhaps not surprising that visual ones (thoughts/illusions) be distorted like a comic or cartoon, because visual thoughts are always like cartoons, but normies don‚Äôt notice. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, & _NAME_, D.

A better approach might be slow tapering so body get enough time to adjust to new dopamine level."

174364231,"There‚Äôs an ‚Äúadrenochrome hypothesis‚Äù theory on why schizophrenia happens. Basically an inflamed brain evokes the production of too much adrenaline which has trouble clearing out, so it oxidizes, forming adrenochrome. Adrenochrome is the same compound responsible for the high of LSD, so if you don‚Äôt want to be basically LSD tripping 24/7, you have to get rid of the adrenochrome somehow. My preferred means of doing that is healing the gut/brain axis, so that inflammation is reduced appreciably. I don‚Äôt like megadosing Vitamin C or Niacin for this though. What I‚Äôm using is a homemade PEMF machine to repair my blood-brain barrier, Daily Essential Nutrients multivitamin (high quality, chelated minerals), this interesting water called ‚Äú_NAME_ Water‚Äù, and L-Glutamine to heal my intestinal lining (it‚Äôs really helping big time with my arthritis.) Also I‚Äôm being good with protein and antioxidants. When I don‚Äôt eat enough fruit, I eat 1-2 tsp ground cloves for that. The only thing that p
eople don‚Äôt have access to is the PEMF machine. Consumer grade ones are fairly weak. Only ones appreciably strong are homemade ATM. I can‚Äôt really help with that for a long, long time. Have to factory-make these and run actual studies on them. Big money things. Don‚Äôt hold your breath."

176087330,"This Friday I am going to graduate from day treatment and move down to transition care. We have a rock we have to write a word on and it gets passed around the room. Everyone says something to you and then you say some parting words. Most of the people in group are new (since I‚Äôve been there a long time) and my counselor wants me to say something relevant to the group. I feel a lot of them don‚Äôt relate to my life or just think I‚Äôm too high functioning just because I have a part time job‚Ä¶ Anyways we watched Silver Linings Playbook at one point in group so I want to talk about finding my silver lining. I want to talk about how I reached my silver lining with the help of day treatment by reminding myself to live a balanced life and take care of all aspects of my wellbeing including education, emotional wellbeing, and helping others. I was encouraged to pursue the arts again and started going to art museums and realizing the love I had for my close friends and how love is the source of art. I d
ecided to invite more new friends to my birthday party and that even lead to a paid gig passing out drug cards. I also started being proactive about my health and that lead to switching to two bad anxiety meds and a mini episode, but I found a supplement that made me better again and I‚Äôm glad I was proactive. I also switched to a new primary care clinic that is very serious about my health. When I first started treatment, I feel like I fell down and needed to get up again, and what kept me going was Women‚Äôs Support Group. The people there had jobs and families and happy attitudes and love lives and they supported me in finding my own path to becoming like that too. They gave me hope. I think I‚Äôve come to a good place in my life again where I have friends, a rewarding part time job, and I‚Äôm getting into art again. There are still problems I have but for now life seems to be moving again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about changing one particular habit but making a concerted effort to take care of all aspects 
of my life that I began to see change. Recovery is a process but that silver lining will always be there. Hope the people here use day treatment as a chance to grow in your recovery. Yeah, something like that!"

It doesn‚Äôt really interfere my daily life so I just let it be. But I‚Äôve learned that antipsychotics can be used for tics. And it can also be used for intellectual disability, autism, dementia, mood disorders, and PTSD.

I do wonder if I have more things wrong with me, but the state hospital/clinic doesn‚Äôt really have the resources to investigate, so I am just on an AP. I must say, I am surprised Amisulpride isn‚Äôt in the US or Canada, as it has been a wonder drug for me."

176087368,"It kind of sounds like this breakup might be quite a bit her fault, too. She keeps you in a place of feeling like you should be grateful to her for her kindness in caring for you, rather than expecting it because that is how people show love. I have seen that attitude before, and it does nobody any favors. She should be treating you like an equal partner in a relationship, not a child to be cared for. From what it sounds like, you manage to care for yourself just fine, and don‚Äôt need someone trying to make you codependent. Perhaps as you work on learning to love yourself, she can work on setting healthy personal boundaries so she doesn‚Äôt feel like she is solely responsible for her partner‚Äôs eemotions."

I know I‚Äôll be able to clean with someone else though, so I could really use the help. But, ugh, my mom can be very robot-like when emotions are involved.

176087466,"I unloaded trucks at Sears for four years at breakneck speed. You might assume that unloading a truck at a department store wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult. Well, it was. I mean we weren‚Äôt unloading steel girders or boxes of nails but there was a lot of heavy stuff like water heaters, power tools like band saws and miter saws, gas grills, TV‚Äôs, lawn mowers, ping pong tables, free weights, etc. It took three or four guys four hours to unload. For two years I was the fastest guy on the crew and I was in my mid thirties working with a bunch of 19-24 year olds. We usually got two trucks a week, occasionally three. Yeah, I came to that job from working at HP for three years out on the dock recycling cardboard, trash, wood etc. and that was a very physical job too. Our three man crew worked our asses off at HP, rain or shine. The job ended because we were contracted in from a different agency and our boss asked for too much money for us. HP said no and simply let us go and hired guys within their own co
mpany to replace us. After we got laid off and I was looking for a new job, I specifically wanted a job where I could use my muscles. So Sears was perfect for me.

176087474,"Delivery is a specific challenge for the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing complex, too, _NAME_, PhD, CEO of Ntrans Technologies, points out. His firm has developed a virus-free cell targeting method called iTOP, which uses small molecules to induce the uptake of therapeutic proteins into the target cell. It may be used for in vivo or ex vivo applications. Because the complex is broken down after a relatively short time, the risk of off-target effects is reduced. In addition, delivery in the form of RNP complex avoids the immune responses possible with viral delivery.‚Äù Additional advantages include ex vivo and in vivo delivery of gene editing systems, virus-free delivery, cost-effective therapeutic formulation, consistency, GMP compatibility, and delivery of na√Øve, unmodified proteins."
176087475,You included that in your application? I would not recommend doing that. You need to make up some flowery brief reason like ‚Äúsought better opportunities‚Äù or something.

176087497,"After the end of WWII the British gave up their empire and became just a small island. One would be forgiven for thinking that the British (I am British by the way) are now, and long time past, minor and irrelevant on the world stage. But why would an empire that large give up on itself so easily? Why would the Brits have given up on their ability to tax half, or more than half, the globe without more of a fight? Are we nice?! We (Brits) left in place the pound, and then the dollar, and there is a theory that so long as the dollar is the only currency that can purchase oil then it can be printed indefinitely without much inflation because everyone wants oil. We (dollar printers and their allies) can drink their milkshake, and tax all oil consumers the world over, so long as dollars have a monopoly on oil. Other than the dollar, the pound and the Yen seem to be printable without inflation. I suspect that this is because they are all in cahoots but I have no proof. But, perhaps the British Empire con

176087508,Yes but not as much as I used to. Quite a few reasons really. First of all I got really into critique. I watch loads of in depth video reviews where they talk about things they didn‚Äôt like and why. And eventually it has taught me to look at things more critically. This is great to help understand why a movie feels unsatisfying or why a movie feels so well put together. But the knock on effect is that I criticise everything way more. Another reason is that sometimes I am internally commenting on stuff and cant shut my brain off. I find this really irritating when it happens. Another reason is I watch less films. I feel like there are less interesting films being made these days. Id rather watch something that has good reviews from people I trust than try something at random and waste my time.

176087528,How do you know that? I‚Äôm scared that I am. I don‚Äôt want to be but what if I am?
176087529,Maybe it would help the relationship to only bring the issue up during actual appointments instead of calling etc between appointments to ask question and deny everything. Pdocs are typically very busy.

176087531,"I just want to jump start my weight loss. Get myself in losing mode. Shrink my stomach. Get off the soda and candy. So I got enough Slimfast for a month. Slimfast is a meal replacement shake. You drink your meal instead of eating. Then on top of the shakes I will eat all the fruits and veggies I want. I‚Äôm planning on exercising everyday too. I‚Äôm hoping to lose 10 pounds in one month. The shakes should be here either today or tomorrow, until then I‚Äôve just been eating a lot of veggies and trying to stay away from too much sugar. I hope this works I just gotta lose some weight. My goal is to lose 80 pounds in a year. Wish me luck."

176087533,My psychology teacher used to say that we eat our emotions. Ppl eat more from stress.
176087534,Many medications and supplements can cause sleep issues. For example omega 3 which most people take can disrupt sleep.

176087538,I was raised vegetarian from birth. Started to eat meat around 12/13 yrs old. I was a super healthy kid.
176087539,I am so so sorry for you _AT_MENTION_ . You‚Äôre in my thoughts and prayers.
176087540,"well, my theory is this: if it doesn‚Äôt disturb your life, job, social life so it‚Äôs fine. well, we will never stop engaging with strange things. delusion or not, as long you can live with that so‚Ä¶ I see no problem. sometimes meds don‚Äôt work, and this is where responsibility comes in, to distinguish when you are ""fine: and when need extra help."
176087541,I found a book about famous artists through history. It is very simple but I am enjoying it. I am so glad I found something interesting to me. I was alert and calm this evening.
176087542,"Contact your pdoc. Maybe they‚Äôll approve of it. If not, try some L Theanine if you have access to it."
176087543,That is a pretty small dose. Do you know what your target dose is?

176087546,"The fact that medications do not work for me, and that there is literally nothing I can do because apparently I‚Äôve lost my free will."
176087547,I lived a normal life before sz. My life kind of sucks now compared to living a normal life but I try to stay happy for the small things
174364278,I don‚Äôt hear voices or see things when I‚Äôm off meds. But off meds I do : ‚ÄúPerceive‚Äù spirit entities Get paranoid Eventually slip into a dream world where I lose touch with reality and become a danger to myself Have telepathic / thought broadcasting experiences Believe everyone is a spiritual guru out to get me Am unable to cope with anything The right med combo for me gets rid of all that. Unfortunately one person‚Äôs miracle med is another‚Äôs downfall. And abilify isn‚Äôt working out for you (possibly) and I just got lucky with it.

176087550,we had lasagna last night and tonight it‚Äôs just cottage cheese‚Ä¶I am still trying to lose weight.

176087552,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ ,this happens to extra ordinary people‚Ä¶ Btw,thanks for sitting with me yesterday,it really ment to me‚Ä¶"
176087553,Maybe someone could help get them for you. I think if you give your ID to a friend or family and a letter of consent they can pick up the meds for you.
176087554,"Yeah I heard, as opposed to akathisia, EPS meds can exacerbate TD. Doctor time I say"

176087558,You have covid symptoms?
176087559,It‚Äôs also a shame we can‚Äôt torture each other which is about the same as having a zoom meeting. Both bad ideas.
176087560,I felt mentally raped by my mother. That is trauma i believe. In her belief and purity she tried to save me from trauma by treating me the way she did. Instead of asking whats wrong with my mother the question was whats wrong with me. I love my mother but she went to far in her controlling ways. She should have grown me into independence and let me leave home when the time came for me. Instead it was more like prisonbreak from the movies.
176087561,"I think to know your own values. And to be one with them. I think that comes naturally when you really know what you value in life. And then Thoughts create behaviour, behaviour creates a way of living. Etc."

176087563,Have a good travel safe.
176087564,College was a nightmare for me. I wish I‚Äôd never gone. I failed to get my degree.
176087566,"My mother never said awful things to me. I am scared my kids will think I don‚Äôt care, though, as I spend all my time in my room and none with them. I hope they can understand some day. And don‚Äôt worry, _AT_MENTION_ - we are here for you."
176087567,Its alright. 151515

176087569,"I don‚Äôt really need sedatives. When I was in the hospital in 2017 I had a freak out attack and they shot me up in the butt with something that helped. I forget what it was, three medicines in one I think."

176087571,"Nothing‚Äôs bugging me today, It‚Äôs like fate has run out Of ammo Or maybe it‚Äôs just reloading."
176087572,"I don‚Äôt know about you _AT_MENTION_, but the thought of thinking and feeling the way I did before meds scares the hell out of me. Also I spent 5 years on heavy doses of ap‚Äôs to get to where I am and I don‚Äôt want to go through that again if I can help it. You may need to be more adventurous with your ap‚Äôs. I know they can be hell if the are the wrong ones, and that you have to stay on them for a few months to know if they are working properly, but it is worth it to get one that works for you. I‚Äôm thinking of changing again. The ap I am on is great for my symptoms and ability to think straight, but I can‚Äôt enjoy anything much, don‚Äôt read, play games, watch tv, etc."
174364292,Have you ever had the tv or radio delusion? Or do you know someone who have?
176087573,"Sorry everyone. It‚Äôs the new medication plus I‚Äôm having trouble at Goodwill, where I work. It‚Äôs me. Thank you though!"

176087575,Good to see you around Saraad. Hope you and your son are well.
176087576,Good luck and congrats!
176087577,First thing is you want to probably stop exposing yourself to those videos. I think that will help a lot. In many situations with mental illness things feed off of focus and attention. If you don‚Äôt feed your delusions they won‚Äôt grow. Another thing that will help a lot is ignoring the voices. Don‚Äôt engage with them. Just ignore them. What this will do is disempower them so they can‚Äôt affect you.
176087578,"You gotta think, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs it going to end?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it going to get you?‚Äù. To answer your question, are you just going to go through life hating everyone unconditionally and where is that going to lead you and what have you to gain with hating everyone? That might answer your question."
176087579,"That can be known only after death and once reached can‚Äôt return. May be earthly life is a testing phase and we can‚Äôt actually die instead transformed to some other just like first law of thermodynamics, matter can‚Äôt be created nor destroyed instead transformed to some other form."
176087580,Best thing for me is a heaping tablespoon of Metamucil in 16 oz. of hot tap water and two Dulcolax tablets.
176087581,"That med is super potent. I was on it for 8-9 months and I felt horrible the whole time I was on it. I think the dose is important with Haldol, but it‚Äôs anyones guess to what level you need. 20mg PRN I had from ER made me feel much worse"
176087582,"Our heater is extremely loud‚Ä¶it sounds like somebody is throwing stuff against the wall. I think it needs to get fixed, things like that used to trip me out. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not doing that anymore."
176087583,Oh okay thanks.
176087584,"i liked the diazepam when i took it bc it just calmed me down, i use to get really uptight and anxious but it is a bit better now i think the nurse gave you good advice bc thats what i do when i need help, the nurse can put you at ease,"
176087585,"I‚Äôve felt the pressure to use again a lot recently. Every time I do I become a psychotic mess and that keeps me sober. Congrats on your sobriety, I know how hard it is."
176087586,"Well, then little by little try to find things you can handle on your own, even if it means handling a situation on your own for 5 minutes before relying on him. Then increase that over time."
174364285,A Canadian federal agent came to my house bcz I attacked a group of jews on a fb page. I said that I am Jesus and that I came back to take my revenge by killing them and free Palestine lol I also said that the _NAME_ terrorist group will kill them. The agent asked me what do I know about _NAME_ and if I knew ppl in the middle east lol I am Syrian and that made him more suspicious. I have family in Syria.
176087587,I think you should go in some scared straight program. Your talking about killing people maybe you should meet some people who will scare you into acting right!
176087588,"No matter if we have this disease or not, how long we can live in this world? Yes its not a long time and after that we all leave this world. Everything in this world is temporary.

176087591,I heard we had the first confirmation of the virus in our town. That is hitting too close to home. Today I caught up with a couple of friends at a friends place. Usually we go to a bar or club and get together. Today it was a private residence. It was a good get together. I am trying to get everyone onboard that no matter what or where we get together every month. It‚Äôs working well‚Ä¶ So the Wednesday Adventure Club has survived three meetings. A few brews and some cool conversation.

176087593,I think about it every day.
176087594,"Its alright, they give me suggestions on what to do to get better. My current suggestion is to keep posting on the forums and chatting with people. Even though i occasionally get voices from hackers watching what i post or the admins using dream manipulation technology on me. They are delusions and im suppose to work through them as best i can by finding places to post and chat to see that its not real. Though i admit i lose touch with reality sometimes thinking that im not talking to real people lol."
176087595,Clearly the answer is not simple.
176087596,I did thank you _AT_MENTION_
176087597,How can i get help from them if i dont even understand basic things. And going through it alone is making my life look harder and harder. I dont have any friends or social support.
176087598,My psychiatrist upped it to 10mg.
176087599,Are you taking omega 3? If yes then stop taking it as it can worsen OCD. I have been taking omega 3 regularly but recently stopped taking it and OCD reduced. I mean doubts reduce due to better ability to get rid of obsessions. Concerning amisulpride I do not know if it worsen OCD or not.
176087600,Do you get pip? You realise you can work any hours and can still get pip ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like dla which my dad had for visual impairment but he worked full time

176087602,"‚ÄúYour wires are crossed‚Äù was a ‚Äòthought‚Äô before this video showed up the next day - or on that day? And when having such wild thoughts of things like, ‚ÄúAnnihilation‚Äù ‚Ä¶ this showed up next day: In which she almost hysterically joked about being afraid about ‚ÄúAnnihilation‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbandonment‚Äù. And abandonment was/is an issue I was/am struggling with. _USER_ID_: Ugh. The idea that the family makes you feel like you‚Äôre the reason for their pain is utterly horrible. Being referred to a way so that it appears that all my ‚Äòbad behavior‚Äô and ‚Äòemotional outbursts‚Äô are simply unfounded and a result of a ‚Äòdisease‚Äô? That is pretty damn cold."
176087603,Great !! I hope I will have the same here !!
176087604,_AT_MENTION_ I know right! I hope it looks good with my dress

176087624,Wow that‚Äôs a lot. Bless you for being strong enough to go through that. I talked to God a few times but I had to realize it wasn‚Äôt him through certain thoughts that happened. I still get confused here and there cause I‚Äôm such a believer that I believe God has the power to do that. So it‚Äôs important that I differentiate and know when it‚Äôs a voice and when it‚Äôs God

They only provided me with the core results not the trait associations. I since got 23andme health and was able to get valuable insight on my gnetic predispositions for certian cancers and diseases. Which is super important to me because I study medicine and have a background in nutrition and health. Prevention is the only treatment for many diseases so knowledge is important.

I go out for 2 week and, after that, I stay at home for 2 months, lol. But I probably need to work better on my socialization. I think if I find a good occupation I can make good friends too. Yeah, I agree. Stopping medicines without medical supervision is just stupid. I agree. I‚Äôm trying to build this structure. I agree. I barely drink. I‚Äôm on a low dose of antipsychotics and I live in a stable place. By the way, my psychiatrist lowered my aripiprazole to 5 mg and I‚Äôm feeling more creative and spontaneous. It‚Äôs a good thing.

I suppose sleeping for 9-12 hours a night isn‚Äôt that healthy anyways. I read somewhere and average person needs 6-8.5 hours of sleep a night to function optimally. I find I function the best when I have 9. I must admit I‚Äôm liking not being so darn sluggish in the mornings.

It‚Äôs gonna be hard going a month without using it as a prn, though. I guess I‚Äôll just have to pay extra attention to how I‚Äôm doing and manage my stress 
levels, taking naps whenever I feel symptoms coming up. I‚Äôve had far less symptoms than usual since I started this job. I think it‚Äôs because when I‚Äôm at work, I‚Äôm ‚ÄúWork-_PERSON_‚Äù and my brain is not gonna get in the way of me doing my damn job. When I do have symptoms, they start on my way home from work when I‚Äôm no longer ‚Äúwork-_PERSON_‚Äù and my brain can relax. I think the routines of it all is really helping me.

176088074,"This brought back memories of my childhood in a small Midwest town. My parents immigrated from Germany to the U.S. a few years before I was born. We were treated very poorly by some of the neighborhood kids. We were called ‚Äúkrauts‚Äù and other slurs. Once a group of boys threw rocks at my older sister and chased her home. Fortunately, she was able to run faster than them. If they had caught her, I‚Äôm not sure what would have happened. Early one morning, a group of boys shot a barrage of marbles at our house using slingshots until my parents chased them away. I was pretty happy when I was able to collect hundreds of marbles from the front lawn that had bounced off the roof and house. Marbles were pretty popular back then. One time, my little brother (he was only 3 or 4 at the time) was riding his tricycle on the sidewalk in front of the house and some much older neighborhood boys tried to steal his tricycle from him. He started crying and my mom could only get the boys to stop by grabbing a broom 
and chasing them away with it. The neighborhood kids told us often that we were going to hell because we weren‚Äôt Catholic like they were. We were Buddhist which was unusual for German immigrants and especially for a small Midwest town. Ultimately, my parent‚Äôs solution was to move the family to California when I was ten years old. Even back then, California was known for diversity and being more open-minded about things like religion and birth country and so forth. I have lived in California ever since."

176088126,How many milligrams? Thanks for replying man.
176088127,More bipolar people take APs than psychotic patients do. They are more widely prescribed as a mood stabilizer than antipsychotics. They are supposed to prevent mania I believe.

176088137,I used to have really strong passion to be a musician when I was younger. As time has gone on the less will I have for it and the more I can see there are big areas of my skillset that need to be signifcantly improved for it to ever work even as a just for fun thing. I was in a couple of bands in the last few years and I find its a lot less to worry about being in a group but I also felt like my own compositions were disgarded too often.

176088156,"I think the main focus needs to be on getting thoughts under control, simply having less unwanted thoughts. Some supplements seem to help me, like fish oil, vitamin D and niacin. I am also currently experimenting with tart _NAME_ juice which I so far think helps relax my brain. It is highly inflammatory and it has natural melatonin. I think my AP is causing my brain to be both inflamed and disrupting my serotonin production/uptake which is responsible for producing melatonin in the brain. Melatonin is a relaxing hormone that controls the wake/sleep cycle. I will know more in a few weeks, and will keep you posted."
176088157,"Some of my posts got flagged. It‚Äôs one thing if a person is genuinely abusive, but if they‚Äôre fair comments they have no right to flag them.

I won‚Äôt go into religion, but all old texts are written by people that didn‚Äôt know how to explain real but weird natural phenomenon. Ever see really old pictures of real animals, but drawn by people who hadn‚Äôt seen them? Same premise. People trying to make sense of their world with little scientific knowledge. We know today that gods and demons don‚Äôt just manifest anywhere. Almost all sightings can be explained by examining the situation. In our cases, we have a history of delusions and hallucinations. So it stands to follow- any sighting of such a thing and interaction would be delusional in nature."

We were angrily interrupted by a manager. Ultimately there weren‚Äôt too many winners.

176088163,"There has always been wrongs in the world regardless of time. There have been wars time and time again, famine, hunger, burning of witches, you name it. Today we are more civilized. We have actually not had any major wars in the world for the last 75 years. It may not sound like a lot, but it is. We are having more equal rights and understanding and freedom of speech than any time before in history. The downfall may be that we as people in the free world are trusted to make good decisions on our own individually. I think many people have a hard time making good choices for themselves. For example spending too much time online, excersising too little etcetera, basically taking the easy ways out. Back in the day it was not common to live alone. Most people had other people around them all the time. Families lived together and took care of their own instead of healthcare which we have today. Having people around us does something in the way we act and behave. Personally I know I have been a stronger p
erson when I have had people around me. When I lived with my ex, or when I was in the army and shared sleeping quarters with others or even when I was in school. I think I might give it a go to join a mental health club to get more social, but the hardest part is always coming home to a empty house, except for my cat which is great company. I‚Äôm still battling away though. My new mantra is:‚ÄúIf I can make good decisions in the presence I am making good decisions for my future‚Äù."

These include lione‚Äôs mane mushroom, cdp choline, phosphatidylserine etc. Side effect is since it lowers dopamine it can worsen negative symptoms and depression in some. NAC, sacrosine and other glycine supplements are reported to help negative symptoms in some. These things increase the glutathione levels in brain which helps to reduce oxidative stress. Anyway these not give a significant reduction in symptoms thus you might still need to take AP if have positive symptoms."

174364486,"Is it true they will get rid of Medicaid? I depend on it; and it is the way I am able to receive healthcare. I have been struggling a lot especially when its colder and I take a lot of vitamins, but the anti-psychotic really helps me because I have pleasant dreams, I am less depressed, and it prevents me from becoming psychotic which is miserable. I don‚Äôt want to live the rest of my life being manic or psychotic although I would probably lose some weight; I risk relapse and drug-abuse and all sorts of things if my Schizophrenia and Bipolar aren‚Äôt controlled. Abilify has also kept me from being suicidal. It really helps keep me stable. If they were to take away Medicaid from me it would make it a lot harder to be med compliant and to consider taking medications for schizophrenia or bipolar. I was also denied SSI in the past few days so I am waiting for a letter to appeal and get a court hearing; I applied for being Bipolar and then my psychiatrist changed the diagnosis to Schizophrenia. My mothe
r also has schizophrenia. I know I wasn‚Äôt mis-diagnosed, that‚Äôs wishful thinking. But I just have issues with the context of the label schizophrenia and how it is used to discriminate people‚Äôs beliefs. I mean I would not mind that they just get rid of medicaid if it means I am no longer called schizophrenic or bipolar, but I am not sure that‚Äôs the best solution."
176088273,"I hope I will have no intrusive thoughts, _AT_MENTION_ recommended some interesting ideas on how but I have yet to try them out.

176088278,Oh you mean delusions. I had delusions and hallucinations at the same time. I was so convinced that I was Jesus that I tried to kill myself twice to verify it. How more real can it get? Delusions are much worse than hallucinatiins in my opinion. They‚Äôre dangerous in my case.

176088281,"Is it seasonal depression? Or is it situational or all year? It depends. If you‚Äôve gone all year depressed, you should probably be on medication because the brain chemicals are unbalanced. I was depressed for 2 years before starting Cymbalta and within 6 -7 months I started to feel better. I was waking up, without the dread. The constant fatigue is gone and my moods are leveled out. So I would suggest speaking with your pdoc about what treatment you may need. Some people try a whole different direction to help the depression, but this is what helped me."
176088282,"Hasn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs experiences changed them? I wouldn‚Äôt call it damaged, and no, your view of life will never be the same. But that in itself can be a blessing.

That‚Äôs not something that everyone can do. To see those things so dark and light, mad, and sane. No one fully comes back from it, Not the same. But that doesn‚Äôt make us worse.

176088378,Ya know dating apps are a poor choice to meet women / men. People hAve been murdered raped or robbed using those apps. If your too shy to meet women then you need to work on that. Some people have met people but the more real life women you meet the more you talk to them the easier it gets. I have tried using dating apps and I had some very bizarre strange women that would message me. None of them were even close to being girlfriend material . You only get one life meet as many as possible fail a bunch have success when you meet the girl of your dreams marry her.

Even if you are treated unjustly, even if you are a victim of family violence, even if you are ridiculed badly, even if you are discriminated against, please accept your true feeling. Granted, it might have caused hard feeling. Nevertheless, you can vent the feelings or grieve, but please do not keep the hard feeling with you for prolonged period, nor pretend nothing have happened. 2. Be courageous in accepting who you really are. Even though you are ugly, even though you are poor, even though you are nobody, please accept who you really are.

IDK how they did it but they both got accepted into the normie world as equals. We all grew up together but somehow they reached that height of being on equal footing with most people. I first noticed it 40 years ago when I really started noticing how they get treated by people in their lives like spouses, roommates, co-workers, friends etc. They can hold their own with most people. They aren‚Äôt rich or powerful but they both had respectable jobs that helped them live comfortably. I, on the other hand, didn‚Äôt belong. I have had friends, and I wasn‚Äôt inferior, but I was not on equal footing. And all my sisters friends, maybe liked me, but they were untouchable. I was tolerated only because my sisters included me in activities. But, even though there is a huge disparity between how my sisters are treated by people, compared to me, somehow we still get along. They have always included me

Delusions can also be recognized by the tendency to inflate one‚Äôs importance. Is it a belief that specifically revolves around you and makes you extremely important in some way? This is also characteristic of delusions. Learning about trademarks of delusional beliefs helps us fight them.

176088509,"Thanks everyone. It‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôm not the only one who developed psychosis so young. I didn‚Äôt talk about my psychotic symptoms for a really long time, because, like I said, I didn‚Äôt think there was anything wrong with me except depression. I thought the screaming in my head while sitting in classes in Junior High and High School was a normal part of depression. After all, I listened to music at the time with lyrics about ‚Äúscreaming in my head,‚Äù so it must be normal, right? But for me it was screaming sometimes and voices other times, but I could only identify the voices as ‚Äúthoughts inserted in my head that I can‚Äôt control, sent by the Judges.‚Äù (The Judges are an entity in my head that control me). I always just thought that I had the worst depression, which I did, but I also had psychosis. I didn‚Äôt open up to my therapist about The People Inside My Head until I was 16 or so, despite living with them since I was 11. I worry that if I ever try to get disability, they wo
n‚Äôt believe that I had SZA since age 11 because my psychosis is not well documented then. I started smoking pot at age 20, which apparently can cast doubt on my SZA diagnosis because pot can cause psychosis, which could then stop me from getting disability. At least that‚Äôs what my lawyer said. I will need to prove that I had psychosis before the pot addiction happened, which, because that was so long ago, I don‚Äôt know if those records exist anymore. I‚Äôm 39 now and not looking to get on disability right now, but I worry about my future."

But different people react differently. Olanzapine and quetiapine comes to mind when it comes to EPS side effects. EPS is least in these 2 drugs as well but will still cause EPS side effects in some people. You may try either of these 2 drugs. These 2 drugs may be your last option.

The Second time, 2 decades later was due to an unsucessful suicide attempt. Both times I wanted out. But on the outside it is reallly hard just to survive without any loving support. Most of my family is corrupt and I live in a backward state that does almost everything possible to destroy the working and middle class. No work, therefore no possibility of a long term relationship with a quality woman. Often I think of the people that I met and made friends with in the hospital. They helped me more than the doctors, nurses (especially) or the drugs. One friend introduced me to doing mandellas (essentially Buddhist ‚ÄòColoring‚Äô) it helped me center a whole lot. She liked to be called _NAME_. There were other important people too. The downside especially was the torture. Nurses and orderlies that should be in jail or prison instead of 
having any position in a psych hospital. A range of radical abuses especially in the second hospital, all sort of threats both upfront and in secret. The experience ended up traumatizing me even more than I already was. Doubling down on an already broken person. Reminds me of somewhere else‚Ä¶"

And then, I heard a very different voice, and it just said ‚ÄúTell your story.‚Äù And no amount of medication or therapy has ever been able to convince me that wasn‚Äôt the voice of God telling me my purpose in life. And I haven‚Äôt shut up since. I am pretty open with my life experiences, and I try to use those experiences to help others going through similar things. And, in the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter if that was God‚Äôs chosen purpose for me or not. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I was just hallucinating that voice. It is the purpose I chose to make for myself, therefore it is my purpose in life. To use my experiences to help others find their happiness. I can live happy knowing that I am achieving my self-directed purpose in life. Maybe this isn‚Äôt helpful. Maybe it is feeding a delusion. But my point is, in 
the end, it doesn‚Äôt really matter what your motivation is for doing good, as long as the good gets done. You don‚Äôt need to know if you are a god or an angel or a prophet or a chosen one. You just need to know that your actions made the world better. If you can say that, you ARE special, regardless of whether or not the rest is true."

176088831,"Yeah, that‚Äôs why certain diets don‚Äôt work. When you‚Äôre on a diet where you are abnormally depriving yourself, this can be the result. I mentioned Dr. _PERSON_ before. One thing I remember from his book is that he said a diet is for life. He said once you lose your desired weight, you can‚Äôt just go back to eating whatever you want like junk food and fatty and sugary foods. You‚Äôll gain that weight right back, and probably more, and quickly. That‚Äôs why he touted his diet as a diet for life. Eating healthy is a life-long endeavor. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúfad‚Äù diets don‚Äôt stick around very wrong. They come and go, they‚Äôre popular for a few months maybe or a year but they aren‚Äôt practical. You may lose a quick ten pounds on the cabbage soup diet but are you going to eat just cabbage soup and bread for the next twenty years? I‚Äôm just writing this in general for anybody not just you Leaf. If a person wants to diet they have to be practical. I‚Äôve been sucked into bad or impractical diets bef
ore too. My sister introduced me to a diet called the Dukan Diet. It was invented by a French doctor Dr. _PERSON_. It was similar to the _PERSON_ diet. His diet, which he swore worked for life, used the same principle that _PERSON_ used. Unlimited meat and low-fat or non-fat dairy in moderation. The difference between the Dukan Diet and Atkins is that when I did the Atkins Diet I could only eat a couple servings of vegetables a day, whereas on the Dukan diet, I could eat unlimited vegetables. Only some vegetables were off limits. The diet actually worked for awhile, I lost 68 lbs on it. And just like on _PERSON_, I rarely went hungry. The Dukan Diet was less restrictive than _PERSON_. The part I liked the most was that while I could only eat vegetables and meat and some dairy for three weeks at a time, on the third week the diet allowed one meal where I could eat anything I wanted (within reason). I could have a spaghetti dinner for example, complete with meatballs and garlic bread, a side of corn bread and a 
bowl of ice cream for dessert. Or a lasagna dinner or enchiladas or tacos and refried beans. Man I loved that part of the diet naturally. I had just a small doubt about the diet before I started. He claimed that his diet changed your metabolism so that once you lost your desired weight, you could eat virtually anything you wanted too (within reason) for six days out of a week as long as for one day all you eat is meat and vegetables. That didn‚Äôt seem too far fetched so I lost my weight and followed his ‚Äúsix day rule‚Äùand discovered it didn‚Äôt work. Gained all the weight back. And eventually the diet faded into obscurity. Anyways, common sense works great if you‚Äôre dieting. Everyone knows that sugar is almost the unhealthiest thing you can eat. Along with the wrong kinds of unhealthy fats. Carbs may not be as bad as Dr. _PERSON_ said, but they should be the right carbs.

176088837,I don‚Äôt think this is a statement to feel bad about at all. Kids are notoriously exhausting to be around. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre saying it out loud. Sometimes it‚Äôs good to find that lots of people share the same feelings. Kids aren‚Äôt my favorite either. They consistently break social norms which gives me more social anxiety than I normally have. They‚Äôre unpredictable and often times not amicable. It‚Äôs not their fault. They‚Äôre still learning how to be decent people. Plus a lot of what they learn comes from adults who aren‚Äôt always decent people themselves. The kid doesn‚Äôt get a choice in who they get to learn from. I get that. But all it means is that I prefer to avoid interacting with children when I can. That‚Äôs all.

174364626,I‚Äôve yet to see someone say it has happened to a person they knew which is good because it would be a moronic thing to do if someone got a job that couldn‚Äôt pay for their meds. But I think the majority of us who are on it dream of working off of it some day due to its restrictions and I wish those of you who try some day good luck and God speed. As for those of you who don‚Äôt I understand why because the long term effects of the meds can become disabling as well and the cost of the health care can become prohibitive.

176088910,"I think the reason I stayed out at first was the support I got from the partner I later married. Then towards the end of the 80s the move to treat people in the community gathered pace. It was not just about doing badly that meant you ended up in hospital, but whether you were deemed to be a danger to self or others. In essence the hurdle for hospitalisation was raised. In one way this was a good thing ,but in terms of community care being adequately funded it wasn‚Äôt. It meant increasingly over time that the non acute , chronically ill , severely mentally ill were increasingly seen as an also ran in terms of help and support. You could be functioning less than adequately ,but if you weren‚Äôt an immediate danger to yourself or others mental health services tended not to care. When my wife got ill I struggled and when she died I declined further. Having no family support close at hand to press for better care, apart from a mother whose drinking had got the better of her, I could be seen to have se
lf neglected though I didn‚Äôt see it at the time . I wasn‚Äôt seen as being a danger to myself or others though so was put in the slow lane for care(apart from a time limited spell under the rehab and recovery team in 2012-2013. Eventually my stepdaughter persuaded me to move. The fact my block of flats was scheduled to be demolished persuaded me. I was very anxious about moving but my stepdaughter made it as smooth a process as possible. It took moving here and my stepdaughter advocating for me to get better care . It needing to be emphasised time and time again that good family care and support in getting better treatment can never be overestimated."

176088930,"Auditory, although the voices normally are not like realistic auditory hallucinations. For me the voices typically like to sound like some other sound I am currently hearing. It‚Äôs as if it is modulating or overlaying to the source sound, for instance if I‚Äôm walking then the voice talks in the rhythm of my footsteps, and it sounds like the footsteps, and the voice seems to come from my feet. If there is no appropriate sound around it ‚Äúmodulates‚Äù the silence, then I can‚Äôt tell where the voice comes from.

If voices are talking to you when you are trying to focus, explain to them that it‚Äôs rude and they need to just go away and that you wouldn‚Äôt do the same to them. When I was dealing with things that got extreme, I pretty much ended up standing up for myself and telling the voices where to stick it (in my mind).

174364669,It took me years. About 6 or 7 until I finally believed it. The last time I went to the hospital they locked me up in a room by myself. Supposedly I was on suicide watch. I hallucinated all kinds of crazy stuff in there but I thought it was all real. Then a little girl came and talked with me. This was just an innocent conversation but she cane into the room through a wall and a chair. I thought to myself how can that be and I figured out I was hallucinating. That was when it started to come together but it still took about two years or so after that. After I got out of that room they gave me a shot of Haldol and a shot of Antivan. They should have given me that when I got there. I was locked up in that room by myself for hours I think. My first thought was that someone slipped me some drugs like acid though. Or LSD. I still think the government gave me schizophrenia or they just intentionally made it worse but I figure out some of the things I believed in the beginning weren‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs a long 
story. When I first got sick I didn‚Äôt think I was sick I thought there was a conspiracy against me. I thought my wife and family were in on it. We got a call that my wife‚Äôs cousin had died in a car accident and she had to fly home for the funeral. I thought he didn‚Äôt really die and this was just an excuse to get my wife away from me so they could plot against me. 11 years later her cousin is still dead. I was just very sick and didn‚Äôt know it. It took years for me to figure this out. That‚Äôs the short version. I could go on and on.

176089032,"The [cytokine] storm has captured the attention of the public and the scientific community alike, and while the general notion of an excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines is well known, the concept of a cytokine storm and the biological consequences of cytokine overproduction are not clearly defined. Cytokine storms are associated with a wide variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases. The term was popularized largely in the context of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection, bringing the term into popular media. In 1993 a group in Boston, perhaps mindful of the recent Desert Storm war, coined ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù to describe their observations in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The term next appeared in 2002 as a description of the disease mechanism in pancreatitis. As with GVHD, the idea was older than the aptly descriptive term, with a pro- and an anti-inflammatory cytokine being incriminated in this condition in 1992 and 1997, respectively. The first use of cytokin

176089037,"Hello, I am relatively new to this forum. I want you to know this is what makes mental illness so hard. While on meds you function very well and then you can fool yourself that you don‚Äôt need them. That is how well you are doing with the meds. There is no shame in meds being needed. I wanted to deeply share with you that sometimes life gets the best of us. I hit rock bottom of sorts and realized that though I might have pain I cried for pain meds too often sometimes. Having both mental illness and chorns sucks. But I have so much to do with in a 5 week period. This is the sweet spot of my meds. I also have chemo for non cancer reasons. I kinda wanted to let you know this because meds can prolong and fix quality of life. Life will carry on even if you don‚Äôt take meds to make yourself feel better. In this case it is up to you to follow doctor‚Äôs advice. Let them evaluate you with some grace. I mean you can still stand up for yourself if you truly feel being unfairly treated. Sorry if this was a 
rant but mental illness is so much more than just popping a pill or to not pop a pill. It to me is more about having a support system and use of tools that includes therapy. Best wishes _AT_MENTION_-Cotton."

176089048,"Yeah, when I worked at Sears. I was on the truck unloading crew and we also pulled items from the stockroom, brought them upstairs and loaded them in customers cars. A typical day we would load a couple items when we first opened and one guy could handle that. But usually after an hour or two the calls would start coming steadily and pretty soon it took two or three guys to pull stock, put it on the freight elavator to take upstairs and load the items in a customers car when they pulled up to customer service. We had all the heavy items like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators. ovens, gas grills, tool chests, lawn mowers etc. It was really easy to get behind. Sometimes the customer service girls would call us directly on our walki-talkies and we would have 9 or 10 customers waiting for their item. And most of the time it would be a steady stream of calls for one of two or three hours, one right after another I just think how stressed I get at my janitor job now but back at Sears, we were doing ten thing
s at once and I was working with people who were cool most of the time but they fancied themselves hoods and tough guys and so while you were doing your job they were giving you sh*t and giving you a hard time. But most days it was unbelievably hectic, I couldn‚Äôt handle that much stress now. This was actually from 1994-98, when I was in my mid thirties.

176089057,"It‚Äôs pretty harmless and if it can help reduce the stress of moving, that is probably a good thing. It may reduce your symptoms."
176089058,I look at psychosis as like a period. When one is delusional/hallucinating etc. Where as schizophrenia is a long term illness where the patient experiences hallucinations/delusions etc. And as others said - people can have psychosis without schizophrenia. So they aren‚Äôt synonyms.

176089068,Sorry i dont know your financial circumstances - but if your still struggling whilst working - i would quit it personally. Even sometimes lay it on a bit thick - and say you cannot cope. Cos they will say if you can hold down a job (i cant) your not entitled to it.
176089069,It‚Äôs good to have variety.

I know it‚Äôs a carcinogen & causes liver cirrhosis yet it‚Äôs the only thing I know so far that can break my anxiety cycle of ever-escalating anxiety. I‚Äôm still managing to hold down 2 jobs so can‚Äôt be too bad, right. What‚Äôs dabs, cbd and THC? (excuse my ignorance). What‚Äôs kiva bars? Based on your musings I‚Äôm thinking of asking my GP for medical grade oil. I wonder if it‚Äôs available in Melbourne town.

176089072,"Googling it, there is not a lot of info on the drug itself. What is the efficacy profile for example? And how does the drug work? Does it make you fat and have akathisia?"
176089073,"I agree _AT_MENTION_ and really feel for you. I don‚Äôt think you can change your situation, simply by motivation, baby steps or changing attitude. But if i was you i really would seek out a medical solution, adding on an AD by trial and error, have a good talk with you PDOC about your locked situation, and try several kinds of medicine until you find a match with your brain and way of being.

176089191,"You will never be satisfied with any amount of proof. This is how the mental illness affects you. I expect that even with most strict isolation your thoughts will continue to race and you will remain disturbed. Maybe you will even develop new delusions. Instead, pay attention to what helps you to calm down. Then invent a grounding ritual for yourself. Counting? Breathing? Praying? Remembering a specific situation or explanation, like how the person you confronted appeared and acted? None of this will remove suspicions from your mind. But it will help you remember that those thoughts are artificial and pointless. P. S. I recommend this only on the basis of what helped me personally. No special training involved, hence, I take no responsibility."

Don‚Äôt talk about personal issues until you know the person well. 2. just be yourself and enjoy yourself 3. get to know the other person well I should not be giving advice about dating since I‚Äôve had no luck. But, I do know it is not wise to divulge about your illness until you have seen the person for over a three months or longer- this may take several dates. I kept my illness to myself and still had problems. So, if you connect with another person after awhile, you can tell her about your illness."

I feel a bit silly tbh. I guess I‚Äôm scared people will think I‚Äôm making it up. How do you feel when that happens?"

176089231,yeah they say that iam in a false matrix prison and the lizards escaped it along time ago by braking the control of God who they say is evil. They say iam the only one that couldn‚Äôt escape it due to smoking cigs and not able to brake the control of God. They move stars on me to prove its a false reality but they say it started in 2015 they ended the world and killed all the animals tortured them and gave them new lives. I ask them why they do this and they say its all just for fun and its what you deserve. I still think that they are ghosts messing with me but they went though alot of trouble with setting up coinicidents in movies tv shows about me. They also say _NAME_ is wrong that they are actually the creators and not invaders and that God is Saturn they also made me belive that I was annunaki but they and me were humans from niburu.

176089232,LS! For the last six years I have been taking 4 milligram Risperdal (Risperidone). It seems that I can not function without an anti psychotic.
176089233,"Your link is not correct, it is this one: https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/172000/act750031995en.pdf But I have read this paper and Amnesty International does not object to the concept of assisted outpatient treatment. Their paper is on abuse of psychiatry for political reasons, torture, such as ECT without medication, long term solitary confinement, rape and beatings, ‚Äúdisappearances‚Äù ie kidnappings/killings, usually for political reasons, and the role of psychiatrists in the death penalty. There‚Äôs nothing in there about requiring people to get a shot monthly or attend counseling because they‚Äôve had a history of legal trouble while psychotic, or will deteriorate and become homeless or commit suicide. Nor does it object to hospitalizing people who need to be hospitalized, whether those people know it or not. As the number of psychiatric hospital beds began dramatically decreasing in the 1960s, rates of imprisonment of the mentally ill went up just as dramatically. Today, individua
ls who lack the hospital care they need are routinely arrested for bizarre (and criminal) behaviors that hospitalization could have prevented; at least six times more mentally ill individuals are now incarcerated than hospitalized. I can‚Äôt copy/paste the chart, but look at the chart in the article. You will see how as the rates of hospitalization plummeted in the US, those same people were instead incarcerated. Amnesty International probably has more of a problem with people who should be in hospitals being in prison instead."

174364747,"Today at day treatment I got the criticism that I can‚Äôt expect people doing worse than me to always need my advice. This is a bit of a vent but I recover quickly and not everyone does and it‚Äôs not my job to help everyone who can‚Äôt get over the fact that they have negative symptoms and spend all day lying in bed. I have a friend who is dating a drug addict and she‚Äôs not even a close friend so it‚Äôs rude of me to feel bad for her. I‚Äôve come to accept that not everyone‚Äôs lives are as bad as mine but I never accepted that not everyone‚Äôs lives are as good as mine either. Some people‚Äôs lives suck. Some people live pathetic lives and their highlight is a walk on the beach with a low functioning bf. That‚Äôs none of my business. They‚Äôre not my friend and they can feel bad for themselves all they want. Can‚Äôt compare myself. I want to deal with my problems in a healthy way and my dreams are worth pursuing even if they seem too small or too big for others. Some people are self destructive
. They have low self esteem or turn to drugs and alcohol or run away from their problems or have low ambitions or motivation. Not my job to change them. Not everyone I hang out with has to want the same things in life I do or be walking a similar path. My life‚Äôs pretty good and I‚Äôm pretty happy, despite setbacks. Yeah. What about you? What are you unapologetic about?"
176089332,"All I have for hallucinations is Amyloban, antipsychotics, Niacin, and dairy / protein avoidance (prevents tryptophan uptake.)

You may respond well to an SSRI antidepressant if you are an undermethylator, though I would consider that a last resort. I?d see a good GP or naturopath to determine whether you are an overmethylator or undermethylator, since a few changes could make a big difference in your well being if you are either. This is an article by a GP about undermethylation , it might give you some insight."

What it really helps me with is HPPD, depersonalization, psychosis, thickness of skin, mood and anxiety. As well as my addiction issues. I was taking Vicodin and _PERSON_ when I was prescribed naltrexone for my alcoholism. Really doing bad.

174364763,"Hi again. Spoke with my psychiatrist today. He increased the lyrica to 75mg twice daily from 50 mg twice daily. Hopefully this will help my anxiety because I have bad anxiety and restlessness. He asked me if the restlessness worsened since starting abilify. I dont think so because I‚Äôve always been like that only its worsened a bit. The other thing he told me was that once I finish at the clinic I‚Äôm to go back to my original psychiatrist and be under his care only. I thought I was going to remain a patient at the clinic but so far that is not what‚Äôs planned. I really dont know what‚Äôs going on except that this psychiatrist liasoned with my main psychiatrist and that‚Äôs the plan they came up with. Anyway the lyrica I hope will help the anxiety. All other meds stay the same. I told him about the horrible visual thoughts I have been having, plus the thoughts my neighbor‚Äôs are reading my mind , watching me and recording me. He asked had i any evidence of recording. I said No. He asked me about 
covid19 how I felt about it, I said _USER_ID_ about it. That was it basically. Do any of you take lyrica at the same dose as me and does it help your anxiety . Thanks"

176089392,"This is not a professional opinion but just a gut instinct. Mainly. I‚Äôd keep my supplements and supplements doses as low as possible because the body has a fine balance of stuffs and throwing in mega doses of things every day may offset that in some cases (some high supplement doses are not good, ideal n can have adverse health effects in the long term) Also the body uses a combination of stuffs to do its job not just the single vitamins found in multivitamins, there‚Äôs things in plant foods required that are not found in multivitamins so its very important not to rely just on multivitamins to be healthy. But also plant foods. That being said I do use supplements too since I am plant based eater, and I hope it‚Äôs for the better(the supplements).

It would be nice to have friends that I choose and that choose me that I feel comfortable with and that don‚Äôt push me around. I‚Äôm pretty gentle so I‚Äôm easy to push around and mistreat .im not ok with it though. I like to be respected and treated well not spoken down at etc I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere in a way. I‚Äôm a misfit. I have difficulties with people. Even my own family. My type of people do exist. I‚Äôm lonely this moment. I can be well without friends though. It‚Äôs better being alone than being with people that abuse you and push you about and don‚Äô
t love or appreciate you or know you etc I love my spirit friends. It is real I think. Not imaginary friends. I have my sacred neigh and dog. I have difficulty with my own family. Maybe in another dimension my people be? I know they exist. Most people don‚Äôt like me. Everyone at my old gym dislikes me and everyone at the ranch talk down at me n dislike me. I don‚Äôt belong in this society the way others do. Never have. Felt it as a child. Better as a adult cause I can spend all day in bed resting and not have to be mistreated etc I don‚Äôt have friends. Or I do maybe a bit if you count contact couple times a year. I used to chat daily with a guy called _PERSON_ but he didn‚Äôt want to be my friend anymore not _NAME_ n others but a precious few. My other x said he will always love me. I can do well with out friends I reckon. It is better to be alone than in bad company with people who hurt you n do u wrong etc I just want to be alone but I would like to have friends but I want to be picky with friends that th
ey are not to push me about just cause I‚Äôm gentle as it hurts me. Doesn‚Äôt make them superior if they have tougher energy that‚Äôs harder . My mum needs to give me space. I love her but I have thoughtsheis a bit psycho. Both parents need to give me space.seriously. They are difficult people to me and I need space.love them that said. I‚Äôm sad now.

176089484,Benzo worsens your memory including working memory so even though you feel less compelling to respond to ocd urges it doesn‚Äôt solve the poor working memory issue instead it can worsen your working memory. Also tolerance quickly builds up requiring more and more dose to feel same effect and you cannot withdraw benzo later time as it can give severe withdrawal effects and ocd can get lot worse than current. A typical state you can reach if raise the benzo dose is this. You do one action then few moments later you not remember if did it or not and this doubt compels you to do it again. This kind of short term memory issues can appear. One usefulness of benzo is your urge to respond to these ocd urges get reduced.

Take the meds and listen to your doctor and be honest with them. You can get away from those strange thoughts and delusions.

My psychiatrist said negatives are from some brain parts having low dopamine while others high dopamine. Antipsychotic lower dopamine mostly in the high dopamine areas. Wellbutrin increases dopamine just in the prefrontal cortex from what I read which is for depression, not sz."

174364800,One day I read about a guy who said getting 3 hours of activity a day of some form of exercise (walking) plus good fats cured him of schizophrenia.

176089560,Trauma is a terrible time. Therapy has helped me quite a bit. I found the most helpful thing for me was systematic desensitization. Where basically you expose yourself slowly to triggers and it basically trains your brain to not see certain triggers as a threat. Like I was scared of therapists/doctors for a long ass time but by going to therapy more and more I learned how to be less scared. And I suggest working with a therapist to overcome your fear.

The last time I experienced thought broadcasting this profoundly was a few years ago, so it really got to me. Needless to say, I fell for it all over again. It is so disconcerting believing someone can hear your thoughts and that one can communicate telepathically. In short, my symptoms have increased and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm headed for a relapse or not. I just want to wish all of you strength in fighting this illness and peaceful days ahead for you all. Thanks."
174364809,I dont think it would necessarily stop those intrusive thoughts (thats what the abilify is for). Like others said‚Ä¶5 weeks is kinda iffy. Is there any type of relief? But the klonopin should help with the anxiety produced by those thoughts though. Ive been on valium for years for this.

174364817,"_AT_MENTION_ , _AT_MENTION_ , others with credentials in counseling, social work, or psychology, or simply anybody who would like to thoughtfully respond: Do you have any input about pursuing knowledge of, and credentials in Psychology? Some background: Background on my diagnosis: Yes, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia over 12 years ago after a psychotic episode that was at least about 2 months long. I‚Äôve seen several psychiatrists since then, and had the diagnosis changed to schizoaffective alone, then aspergers alone, and then back to schizophrenia depending on who is doing the diagnosing. My current psychologist told me that he believes I merely had what used to be called a nervous breakdown. I started seeing a psychologist regularly since about April of May of this year. Background on my educational background: I have a B.S. in computer science from a regionally accredited university. I realize that is very different from psychology, however it might be accepted as a 4 year degree for entran
ce into some Master programs, and if I decide to pursue a second bachelor degree, I should theoretically be able to transfer many of the core credits. Perhaps on only 2 full time years of course work may be left for a degree in psychology, in either case. I‚Äôve started considering pursuing knowledge of, and credentials in psychology for a few reasons. My parents are aging, and I think that some knowledge of psychology may help me to ease their difficulties. One of my relatives has a dog training business and is an animal psychologist, and I think that some knowledge of psychology may help with that business. Another of my relatives runs a rather large alternative health shop, and they could probably use a psychologist, if I ever get to that distant goal. My psychologist told me during one of my first visits that with my knowledge I should be a psychiatrist. He has actually asked me for advice on his medicine if I show up early for the appointment (he says I‚Äôm on HIS time). At 44, and especially at my finan
cial status, I believe that it would be folly for me to attempt medical school. So, during our next visit, I intend to ask him if he thinks that I might make it in some aspect of his profession of psychology. Having experienced a pretty bad psychotic episode, perhaps I can be of some help to others who have experienced that rather extreme condition of human consciousness. I‚Äôve also experienced the seemingly ineffable sedation of being on particular doses of particular antipsychotics for about 6 years, and other less sedating doses for about another 6 years. I was even on a combination of an antipsychotic and Paxil once. Despite the heavy sedation, I still managed to work full-time, almost always. I started going to classes on my next job within a couple of weeks of first getting on meds. I also lost about 70 pounds working full time when I couldn‚Äôt seem to swallow my food quickly, including throwing meat in a meat packing facility in sub-zero temperatures with my hands in partly frozen beef blood (wearing 
gloves, of course) while munching _NAME_‚Äôs Pieces during short breaks to try to keep from losing more weight. I also did mental work while sedated. I think that the practice of psychology could use more people who have some understanding of how to function in the full time working world after a psychotic episode. Age discrimination seems to work in reverse in psychology. I may be getting to an age where the corporate world may throw me away. For those who have been involved in the counseling world like _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ : What did you like most about it? What did you like least about it? Would the pursuit of a B.S. in Psychology from Penn State University, or the pursuit of an in-person pre-clinical M.A. from another university be more fitting? Would an online doctorate from ASU be of any use? Should I simply ask practicing psychologists how to break into the field? For others who have not been professional counselors, or anybody who has posted on the forum, really: Has any formal knowledge of p
sychology helped you in your personal life, such as helping aging parents with the aging process, even if it has not yielded employment or your own business in psychology? Thanks, for thoughtful replies, in advance."

174364830,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1975. Over the last 45 years I have been involved in just about every mental health situation except long term hospitalizations. From 1975-1993 I was hospitalized 13 times and have been ‚Äúpsychotic episode‚Äù free for 27 years. I am a college graduate, which I attended during the height of my illness, a Poet and an educational sponge. I believe, barring suicide, recovery is always a possibility through self-awareness, love from loved ones and a belief in the gifts of the Universe. Although it might t seem impossible at times to overcome this condition, every diagnosed person must be encouraged to keep up the good fight for sanity and a restoration to health. This goes for loved ones and caregivers as well. Keep the faith even during setbacks and hospitalizations because I have learned from my own experience that the darkness is greatest before the dawn."

Well, really, the only permanent solution is to stop smoking, but I know that seems daunting for a lot of people. It‚Äôs a good idea to give up the pot though, if you already have schizophrenia.

This might sound either super crazy or super typical, but I swear that lately when I‚Äôve been feeling fiery like this, he and I are as close as ever. But I wish I could tell him why, and explain how this feels, help to open his third eye. He is a believer in only science, and I feel like I‚Äôve bogged him down with too much of my SZA ????????"
176089771,"So after three days without doing my t‚Äôai ji in the morning, I did moves 1-30 of the _NAME_ style form today at around 11:30am. I really want to get into the routing of doing it after I phone my mother at 10:00am, but at least I did it today. Being strict with time has never been my strong point, indeed sometimes I think there is no benefit in it, as it goes against going with the flow, however without order in one‚Äôs life, one can become agitated and restless. So hopefully I will be able to stick to doing morning t‚Äôai ji at around 10:00am every day from now on. Thank you."

I have my good patches as well, it does come back but I can cope. I would hate to go to hospital! I told my husband I don‚Äôt want to go, that I will be fine.

176089774,I had a psychiatrist who yelled at me at the top of his lungs. I should have punched him in the face. It can be difficult I‚Äôve been through many many case workers . The psychiatrists are not great here. It‚Äôs worth it to looking into better help. Got a nurse practitioner. Very kind and listens.
176089775,I got my MBA online. I wrote a lot of papers. This was from 2002 to 2004 and I lived in Japan so there was no school I could go to. It was convenient. I wasn‚Äôt sick yet.

People don‚Äôt understand reincarnation. It‚Äôs possible I was lied to or brainwashed by aliens/government too. From my stance or point of view, we found out long ago we lived in a computer simulation run by either extraterrestrials or people like us that are just more sophisticated. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to state or tell here on the forums what I found out about them. I suffered a lot. People could get upset or triggered. Sometimes, I think the government runs the simulation, but then that makes no ??????? sense, because they cannot help us or interact with us really. I really doubt that anyways.

176089792,"That‚Äôs wonderful, _AT_MENTION_ . 39 BMI!!! That‚Äôs great!!! I‚Äôm so proud of you!! You are quite the inspiration. My weight this morning was 158.8 lbs. At that weight, my BMI is 23.8 My dietician told me that that is perfect and like you told me, I don‚Äôt need to lose any more weight. I am happy at that."

174364861,"So this is kinda hypothetical now but a few days my dad(schizoaffective, im bipolar so hes a lot more comfortable talking to me about his issues than other people now, we got a lot closer after my diagnosis) Asked me to drive to his house (30 miles away but i was an hour) and take him to the hospital to be committed because he felt homicidal. My state has the single worse mental health care in the US. It has I think 100 adult hospital beds not including psych wards in ERs. Shortage of many meds. For the most part, immediate voluntary commital is impossible, because they assume if you voluntarily commit you are not bad enough. This has previously caused my dad a lot of issues. Twice refused when he originally was having issues. Next time he was so bad, he tried to kill my mom, and a nurse asked why he wasnt commited a lot sooner. Basically, when my dad says he needs commited, I want to make sure that is the case. But i was drunk and high and could not drive. I told him to call 911, he said the PD re
fused to commit (this is despite him being known around town for being ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù) All I could tell him was next time punch the cop, even jail is better than him killing someone. (Police brutality is not a big issue here, corruption mostly, so im not too worried about him being shot, but its still terrible thats the best advice I can give him) I saw my dad today though offered to take him to another city if thats what it took to commit, he said the mania faded and he was better, especially after taking a long walk today."

Specifically the function where you can have notes provided to you. My biggest struggle was with paying attention in lecture. That is already not how I learn and combine that with constantly being either sleepy or psychotic (I had not yet found the right med combo during my 1st degree) and my ability to take my own notes was slim. Also taking online courses helped a lot because I didn‚Äôt have to deal with my ptsd issues of being out in crowds and not having personal space like on the bus and I could do things at my own pace and rewind a lecture if I missed something or whatever. For my 2nd degree I did it almost entirely online and I was stable on meds so it was significantly easier, I didn‚Äôt even need to use my schools disability services then. So basically, utilize disability services, find good meds. Online courses may be of benefit."

176089996,"Dear band teacher, The day you kicked me out of band trip because I was schizophrenic, I really thought about killing myself because you hated me. You said you were trying to protect the group, but I was just a sick 17 year old kid who wanted to go with my friends. My friends even tried to sign a petition to help me get to this trip, but you snatched this paper away from my friends when they did so. I‚Äôm thinking about this now- it‚Äôs been more than 8 years since you rejected me from this band trip. I will never forget it, but you have made me realize that this band trip was not even worth it. I hope you realize that since I got rejected from this band trip for just having schizophrenia, I have been having self-esteem issues that spanned years. I no longer see myself as valuable and I no longer love myself because I simply don‚Äôt trust people like you anymore. Still I hope to have some self-esteem, but thank you for giving me a chance to look at myself more. You may have rejected me from this tr
ip, but I just got accepted to a prestigious university. I plan to do internships in psychology/special education and even go further onto doing my PHD. That, I guess, is something you never expected from a schizophrenic. Last time I met you at my university, you said you still remember me. I was going to ask you if you still remember kicking me out of the trip, but I didn‚Äôt say it for the sake of your band students. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin your reputation and cause confusion. I could have emailed the board of education to seek for your downfall, but I didn‚Äôt. I hope you learned a valuable lesson from this- that is, to never presume someone is dangerous by their mental illness. I believe in second chances, and maybe you have realized that the choice you made wasn‚Äôt the best one. I just want the best for you and for your precious band students. I hope your school remains as one of the top schools for band and choir. I truly enjoyed my time in the choir and I loved being part of this school. Thank you for 
teaching me that high school isn‚Äôt everything- I joined choir in university and I really enjoyed it. Sincerely, your student"

176090001,Schizophreniform is my current diagnosis; I was diagnosed with it six months after my first and (to date) only break which would mean I‚Äôve had it as my diagnosis for about a year and a half. Shortly after receiving that diagnosis I made the mistake of ceasing contact with my medical team except for refills. I‚Äôve experienced mild psychotic symptoms past the initial six months following my break and I believe the stipulation for schizophreniform is the cessation of psychotic symptoms after those critical six months? so I‚Äôm probably due for a psychiatric checkup and possibly a revised diagnosis.
174364925,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia is a cognitive illness: time for a change in focus. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, JAMA psychiatry , Oct 2013 Schizophrenia is currently classified as a psychotic disorder. This article posits that this emphasis on psychosis is a conceptual fallacy that has greatly contributed to the lack of progress in our understanding of this illness and hence has hampered the development of adequate treatments. Not only have cognitive and intellectual underperformance consistently been shown to be risk factors for schizophrenia, several studies have found that a decline in cognitive functioning precedes the onset of psychosis by almost a decade. Although the question of whether cognitive function continues to decline after psychosis onset is still debated, it is clear that cognitive function in schizophrenia is related to outcome and little influenced by antipsychotic treatment. Thus, our focus on defining (and preventing) the disorder on the basis of psychotic symptoms may be too narrow. 
Not only should cognition be recognized as the core component of the disorder, our diagnostic efforts should emphasize the changes in cognitive function that occur earlier in development. Putting the focus back on cognition may facilitate finding treatments for the illness before psychosis ever emerges. So it‚Äôs more of a cognitive illness rather than psychotic. I could be wrong that is what I‚Äôm reading."

176090008,"I‚Äôm paranoid. Started when I was 19. I was seeing this really nice therapist. A doctor told my parents I needed to be hospitalized. So my parents had me admitted to a psyche ward, and weirdly enough, the psyche ward was over a hundred miles away. But I didn‚Äôt fight it or protest, I just went along with the program. And after a week and a half there my parents found a group home and I ended up staying there a year. At the beginning of my stay at the group home I went through a phase where I thought my family caused my illness. At first I blamed it on my sister and the result was she never visited me the whole time I was there. Then I blamed it on my parents and I didn‚Äôt want to see them. But they didn‚Äôt give up on me. They would still call and visit me. I remember Christmas at the group home. My parents came over but I treated them coldly and didn‚Äôt want to talk to them. We went out on the front porch and they gave me some gifts, like some socks and a book or something. Nobody talked and w
e just sat there and then they left. I told this story to my sister who was in the Air Force at the time. She was taking some class and she wrote down the Christmas story for the class. She told me that a lot of people in class got really sad over it. Anyways, that was one of many low points of mine but eventually learned that my parents didn‚Äôt cause my illness and were actually on my side and doing everything they could to help me. After I got that straight my relationship with my family got a lot better and they became my biggest allies and supporters. And my parents helped me and never gave up on me until my dad passed away ten years ago and my mom 5 years ago. They supported me for 30 years and I still have my sisters who help me, even though I do most things for myself. And they are the ones who got me into a nice place and stayed in touch with my counselor. And I used to ride the bus for 1 1/2 hours to visit them on weekends.

However, results from functional neuroimaging studies using negative emotional stimuli have failed to confirm this assumption. One of the potential reasons for the lack of effect is that study participants with psychosis may display aberrant brain responses to neutral material rather than to threatening stimuli. The authors conducted a functional neuroimaging _NAME_-analysis to test this hypothesis.A literature search was performed with PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase to identify functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to neutral material in patients with psychosis. A total of 23 studies involving schizophrenia patients 
were retrieved. Using t-maps of peak coordinates to calculate effect sizes, a random-effects model _NAME_-analysis was performed with the anisotropic effect-size version of Seed-based d Mapping software.In schizophrenia patients relative to healthy control subjects, increased activations were observed in the left and right _USER_ID_ and parahippocampus and the left putamen, hippocampus, and insula in response to neutral stimuli.Given that several limbic regions were found to be more activated in schizophrenia patients than in control subjects, the results of this _NAME_-analysis strongly suggest that these patients confer aberrant emotional significance to nonthreatening stimuli. In theory, this abnormal brain reactivity may fuel delusional thoughts. Studies are needed in individuals at risk of psychosis to determine whether aberrant limbic reactivity to neutral stimuli is an early neurofunctional marker of psychosis vulnerability."

From the beginning my dad was curious and interested about my delusions and what I thought. I think part of the reason is my dad experienced his own brush with mental health problems. When we were living in Los Angelas when I was just a toddler, he was on his way home from work as he had done a hundred times before but this time, suddenly nothing looked familiar and he got out of his car and started wandering around and then punched a concrete wall. The cops came and wanted to put him in a psyche ward but my dad was having none of it and he somehow avoided it and they let him go. But yeah, for about 30 years until he died; I told him all my delusions and he tried to help me overcome them. Later, as I got

We talked on the phone at least once a week and he tried to reach me about life and I told him my struggles in daily life, not necessarily related to schizophrenia. He was curious alright, but after seeing me at my lowest and listening to me talk, and sometimes rave about crazy stuff I erronously percieved, and he knew what I went through on a daily basis, I‚Äôm certain he didn‚Äôt glamorize it or romanticize it or wanted to be schizophrenic."

174364956,Yes abilify is CRAZY when it comes to appetite for me too but I‚Äôve had amazing results in terms of positive symptoms so I‚Äôm very reluctant to swap it.

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think people are lying to you. Now, lets act as though what you said is true, and work through the logic to see if its a delusion or not. Are you a famous celebrity, are you really wealthy or associated with an influential person? Well known? If not, you are likely not being spied on by malicious forces. People around you probably figure out you‚Äôre a bit paranoid and delusional because you have a sincerely held belief that people are specifically spying on you. Thats not to say that cameras and security cameras aren‚Äôt around, or that people aren‚Äôt looking at you, but most folks just do that randomly and don‚Äôt care about anyone other then people who act strange or look like they‚Äôre shop lifting. Please stay calm and take the doctors advice sincerely then be proactive about side effects of the medication. If peop

Tasks requiring mobility suddenly (or gradually) and inexplicably seem to be ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù Activities such as shopping, getting groceries, caring for the daily needs of one‚Äôs children and meeting the demands of employment or school are commonly affected.

My current doctor is like Doctor House and he finally said IF I get a diagnosis, he will prescribe them, but that‚Äôs the only case. I think I got a mild version combined with an above average IQ. Maybe 120-130 as a child. High, but nothing to brag about. I took a disability test as a child and it came back negative for impairment. They got pissed off at my mom for getting and insisting on the testing. I think she just couldn‚Äôt stand me or handle me as a kid. I had severe behavior problems, wasn‚Äôt a bible thump-er, and probably had ODD ‚Äì maybe. I have real memories of getting psychosis from stimulants, but also in some of my past (other) lives, I had great success with them. I turned into a super genius or something. 
I studied quantum mechanics in one life, and got a few college degrees in my other lives. I hope it doesn‚Äôt cause permanent psychosis, brain damage, or ruin my life. I‚Äôm willing to risk it.

So that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll look it up to double check but if I‚Äôm right I‚Äôll just save it for the next time I feel one coming on and nip it in the bud. She‚Äôs actually doing me a huge favor in a way.

174364981,Whether you have schizophrenia or are on the psychosis spectrum depends on who you ask. Some docs stick to DSM and will diagnose schizophrenia. On the other hand some doctors even claim schizophrenia does not exist but there is psychosis spectrum. Then you could be diagnosed from mild psychosis to severe psychosis. It depends mostly on which country your in. USA = DSM. Here in Belgium it depends on the doctor with the advice of the high health council to not use DSM.

176090310,"When I was younger and scared of hell and dying, I listened to prominent atheist debaters and the rhetoric, it didn‚Äôt seem particularly wrong, and I eventually grew comfortable with the concept of death. Eventually I developed depression and again became preoccupied with death, but the medication swept that away, and now I‚Äôm pretty much content. If hell as a concept scares you, its probably because its meant to be quite scary as a concept. A lot of faiths have hell like concepts. I just think that now that I know about so many more religions and faiths, with hell concepts. They‚Äôre all pretty terrible, but there are so many of them its sort of cathartic to just throw up your hands and assume you‚Äôll go into any number of hells if you‚Äôre wrong. The process of getting out of worrying about hell though is actually not all that brave. If you at the end of your researching and pondering come to conclude that you‚Äôre still scared, and you don‚Äôt want to go to the hell you have the most faith in
, all you have to do is just follow your doctrine. Just about every faith expects some sort of doubt in their own beliefs to be inevitable. So feel free to have a good think about it, and do some reading and introspection. I‚Äôve done some more reading and I think that, I‚Äôve come around to being excited if I end up in a hell. Its going to be very enlightening about the state of reality one way or another. What I‚Äôm worried about is the process of death itself. How long it takes, and how I‚Äôll feel during the process.

I saw a neurologist had an EEG and was diagnosed with chronic migraines. I had some minor brain damage or potential issues. I have a white spot on my frontal lobe and a pineal gland cyst. I was a hypochondriac at the time and thought I was having silent seizures or something because I had altered states of consciousness and weird ???? going on like DP/DR or worse. I have white hyperintensitites all over my brain that cannot be explained. I‚Äôve never seen the mri. They mentioned a possibility of vasculitus (caffeine?) or a brain tumor (begnin?) and Multiple sclerosis. Neurologist didn‚Äôt think I had schizophrenia but sleep issues like sleep apnea, night terrors, hypnogogic hallucinations, and chronic migraines. He said pineal gland shouldn‚Äôt do much. I got put on Topamax. Got paranoid and had another MRI that showed no worsening of symptoms. 
Migraines can cause brain damage. I don‚Äôt get bad cases but maybe caffeine is causing silent, brain damaging migraines? I stopped the Topamax due to extreme paranoia and ‚Äòpsychosis‚Äô. It took years to recover. I figure it‚Äôs a lot of stuff not just one thing. The best thing about topamax is extreme weight loss because it counters and undos the weight gain from APs.

Why do I love movies? Why do I need to own the dvd? What is it going to give me by buying the dvd? An hour or two of viewing pleasure, and then what? Will it collect dust? Will I watch it again? What do I gain from owning it? What is it about it that I love? Is it describing the movie to another person and showing them it? What and why? What is the point of my hobby?

174365044,My dr decided it was best for me to be in the hospital to get on clozapine so my bloodwork was done there. I was in the hospital for a month. When I got out of the hospital I only had to go every two weeks and now I‚Äôm at a month. It is tough getting there but I‚Äôm so scared not to be able to get my meds it drives me to do it. The pharmacy will not give the meds without the bloodwork.
176090441,"I got gangstalked again in 2018. I slipped up and told my psychiatrist about how mass shooters were also gangstalked. I dabbled in telling him about conspiracies about how this group after me wants to paralyze my brilliant mind because i know the truth that they are from universities doing experimental black contract work on people with mental illness because they have a sick world view on people with mental illness. I was then stalked by them and followed around through satellites. Theyre outside my window right now btw. I ended up getting the injection, its alright once you get used to it, personally i think i need the pills with it at a low dose. Cheers to another year of not being dead at least."

176090452,"I‚Äôve lost a ton of friends over this illness. And to be honest there are only 3 family members I can currently call, no friends to call, and 1 family member I can write too. If those 4 people die I will be nearly all alone in the World except for a few people to talk too at this group home who fade in and out from the World, some doctors and nurses who will only see me when they get paid, and some staff members who generally prefer to be somewhere else than here."

We are affected at our best earning cycles and we are totally marginalized like a lot of other folk. Vote. Contribute to your future.

176090459,"The famous rope bridge experiment by _PERSON_ and _NAME_ (1974) suggests a strong connection between fear and pleasure. _PERSON_ and _NAME_ (1974) had a woman collect answers to a survey on a rope suspension bridge over a ravine, and on a concrete bridge over the same. The male participants were told they could phone the woman to ask questions, if they had any, and were given a phone number. The number of participants phoning the woman later were greater when they had been asked the survey on the rope suspension bridge. It was argued that the fear that they felt on the rope bridge was mistaken for attraction towards the woman."

176090461,_PERSON_ I hear them it doesnt bother me though
176090462,In my country you get told the limit to what is insured when you send your item
176090463,with injections you have the plus that it gets released to the body over time so you don‚Äôt get the plasma level spikes that you get when you take oral meds‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more constant in your blood.

176090465,i can relate to feeling that your life is useless‚Ä¶ i feel like that a lot too but i know there is people that like having me around so it becomes not useless really‚Ä¶ i think it‚Äôs the same for you‚Ä¶ it might feel useless but there is still people that like having you around.
176090466,Keep in mind they may not be able to accept gifts. When I worked in care I wasn‚Äôt allowed anything worth more than 25$
176090467,"I was in the same situation but didn‚Äôt let my gf get pregnant, I told her I don‚Äôt want a kid now, I am only 20 y.o. She left me when I got hospitalized for 4-6 months, she told me I am doing nothing in my life and somewhat said I am a looser and useless. Once, I went to her house and saw a guy there who told me to never come back here, I told him chill all I wanted to know is if she was still interested in me and I know my answer now. I never went back and forgot her. Fights are useless and only bring more problems. I haven‚Äôt had a gf since I got sz 9 years ago."
176090468,_AT_MENTION_ . I think you‚Äôre suffering for excessive worrying. Catastrophic thinking basically. Catastrophic thinking is a symptom and I think you should report it to your psychiatrist. Just so they know. None of the things you‚Äôre worrying about are going to happen in our lifetimes if ever. For what it‚Äôs worth even a small bit of L-theanine helps me with catastrophic thinking. But maybe your psychiatrist could suggest something stronger.
176090469,Yes thank goodness. He had side effects with the first shot but he was fine with the second dose.
176090470,"I hope you can get things sorted soon. It‚Äôs my experience that either the DWP plays silly buggers, or the letter you get from your mental health team to send with your claim is so basic as to be useless. I‚Äôve had the latter and chasing up the nurse practitioner to provide a more informative letter was a fool‚Äôs errand ."
176090471,"Oh man, sorry you had a rough time. ADs can be either amazing or terrible, it seems like. Lexapro withdrawal symptoms made me extremely agitated. That med did nothing good for me whatsoever, come to think of it."
174365061,Does it works for depression
174365060,Yeah I made a thread about the Fanapt commercial also. I was pleasantly surprised to see a commercial on TV talking openly about schizophrenia. Yes they mention hallucinations and paranoia. This made history.
176090472,I had a bit of catatonia on weaker meds and doses like Latuda 80mg.
176090473,I don‚Äôt mind that it has been pointed out that I‚Äôve had some privileges. I think most living people have. Even surviving long enough to be born is a privilege that some humans don‚Äôt get.

176090485,"I‚Äôve also always been like this, since I was 8. I think before I must have been a free spirited child. I cried a lot when I started having symptoms.

176090492,Apparently I didn‚Äôt care when I was a kid as I was more happy with my lego bricks than a TV just left to it
176090493,"It gives the lesson that not cling with materialistic things in life, as it all becomes pointless after die. Consider you have everything in life, happiness all. Will it exists forever? no it all up to death so not get sad as nothing lasts forever. Our bodies age and notice the old people all have some kind of physical issues and its the way of life. Some get illness early but others late but death makes everyone equal. So don‚Äôt get sad about things in life. Be happy with what you already have, find happiness in small small things. For example just like Mr_Hope said find happiness in drinking a cup of tea, going out for a walk and many other things."
176090494,"My feet hurt. It‚Äôs throbbing pain, it actually started a few weeks ago but now it hurts worse. Probably from being on my feet all day."
176090495,Doctors usually ask questions to see if your thinking is predictable or symptomatic. It‚Äôs a bit of an art that of psychiatry. Usually I talk about cricket with mine. He sees if I‚Äôm being rational or my thinking is off. It‚Äôs not the easiest of things but your doctor will get an idea about your thinking from questions.

176090521,"What you do and what you say in the real World is all that matters. What you discuss with your voices is meaningless. And by the way most people have their own problems and don‚Äôt want to hear a lot of crap about the voices in your head unless they are telling you to harm yourself or others. Then it matters to them. But once you are over that situation life goes on. Some people think there is something interesting about your voices because they don‚Äôt have them themselves and they don‚Äôt know how boring, annoying, or damning they can be. If you tell them the truth they won‚Äôt stay that way."

174365076,I don‚Äôt think it will hurt you. When I first got sick I was really bad and I honestly didn‚Äôt think I was sick but I had a lot of trouble.

I have a government job now and they know I have at least a 30% disability. They haven‚Äôt asked me any questions and I let them know I have a lot of VA appointments.

174365086,"I was born in the 1980s. Won‚Äôt give the specifics but I‚Äôm almost 30 years old. It‚Äôs 2019. I‚Äôve been schizophrenic since 2011. So that‚Äôs 8 years I‚Äôve been sick. Not sure what happened. I have to fill in huge gaps. When I first got sick at college, and was talking to a therapist, I had strange pictures or flashbacks in my head of men in black suits torturing me. Anyways, I failed to mention this to the therapist and it since vanished from my memory and subconsciousness for years. I probably started remembering things around 2014-2015. Were aliens involved? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Anyways, I have told my therapists and doctors everything and have yet to get a real diagnosis of PTSD because I have schizophrenia and have never been in the military or seen combat. Despite stuff probably happening to me, having an acute stress disorder diagnosis, and severe DP/DR. I wouldn‚Äôt even doubt I was given LSD or some other experimental ???? in this life (100% sure in my other lives). Not sure why I want a 
real diagnosis of PTSD. Probably never had one. Are my doctors old school, scam artists, or is it insurance reasons? Are they covering their asses? I understand the no adderall thing, despite them giving it to me in other lives. (I‚Äôm starting to call them sideways universes from now on). I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a liar, a con man, a scam artist, a delusional person, etc. I know what‚Äôs real ‚Äì sort of. I have problems with my long term memory. I have no idea how many times I‚Äôve been hospitalized or when my last out patient was. I know it‚Äôs about 20 times for outpatient AND inpatient combined. Was my last outpatient a few months ago or a couple months ago? I have to actually look at the paperwork. Despite my decline in short-term memory and difficulties with studying mathematics, I‚Äôm actually doing fine in that department. My biggest complaint is the lack of belief and serious help in getting out of this stupid, ???????? goddamn time loop. The only way I can get out of it is probably through alien or mi
litary help, though I‚Äôm scared of both ‚Äì I‚Äôm a million times more scared of aliens ‚Äì most of the time and depending on the type and circumstances. Scared of the military for obvious reasons like them uploading my brain to a computer for research after I die‚Ä¶as one example. Probably did happen before. I cannot function, I cannot take care of myself, I cannot work, I cannot go to school, and I have a serious addiction to energy drinks that worsens my situation. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm special at all. But it would be nice to get more money from social security like SSDI despite not having a work history‚Ä¶because there is zero chance I‚Äôll get monetary compensation for being an alien abductee or government lab rat that was experimented on many, many times (mostly in past lives). I know most people don‚Äôt believe in aliens, and I didn‚Äôt either until I saw some UFOS fly over my house back in 2016 ‚Äì I think. I thought we were alone back then. Now I have more of these memories where I volunteered to be 
an alien abductee in a past life (once) and even in these stupid experiments that no one believes and just left me hanging, poor, and suffering. I‚Äôm probably one of many. Maybe millions‚Ä¶ As I type this, the ‚Äúvoice in the back of my head‚Äù tells me not to talk, not to write, and not to talk about the graphic things in detail that happened to me in my past lives. For instance, was tortured and raped in my past lives many times by ‚Äúrandom‚Äù people. Some I knew, some I didn‚Äôt, and some that lied on who they worked for. I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care. Sometimes, it was aliens too. I tend not to believe anything people tell me anymore. I get scared because of certain things. For instance, I had my head cut off a few times. Pretty sure greys cut off my limbs or were trying to do some experiment on me too. Sometimes, this happened thousands of times in a row in a hell-like reality I used to call purgatory ‚Äì usually at the mental hospital. That‚Äôs why I try to believe in God and all that stuff. I try 
to be a good boy. I try to believe in sin and karma because I sometimes blame myself for stuff in my past lives (different person, really). That‚Äôs why I sound like a mad man sometimes. I think people find me annoying too. I have a hard time sleeping but I‚Äôm sort of mildly immune to it over the years. Sometimes I leave the light on because I fear I‚Äôll be killed in my sleep or something. Sometimes, I just try to ignore it and hope if it does happen that it would be quick and that I‚Äôd have a better life in another life, which probably won‚Äôt happen. I mean I‚Äôm here now typing this and I‚Äôve probably typed this exact same ???? many times before. It seems I‚Äôve had a few good or even great lives, but that‚Äôs out of many ‚Äì like billions or trillions. Anyways, that‚Äôs all for now. Thank you."

Mental health services are supposed to be confidential but I suppose people can figure it out somehow. But it‚Äôs also possible you‚Äôre being paranoid.

176090676,"Our vaccination schedules are shifting around now that the federal government sourced a large supply of nearly expired AstraZenica from a sketchy supplier. I had planned to avoid that one as it‚Äôs known to have lower efficacy, but they‚Äôre not giving it to anyone over 65 or those with serious underlying health conditions (hi there!). Looks like I‚Äôm still waiting until at least April when they get around to my cohort. They‚Äôre now also spacing out the second dose by about four months so I‚Äôll spend this summer in hiding as well. Frustrating that our government is so incompetent in all the things they do."

176090682,Heavy periods‚Ä¶womens problems.
176090683,I‚Äôm super friendly But I remember when my mental illness started to show I had no idea what to say to people. And then I started only tAlking about my problems and then later I realized nobody cares or wants to hear about problems. I don‚Äôt know I just started showing up and I would smile and say hi how ya doin and now I‚Äôm great with people. Also I noticed people feel uncomfortable when you feel uncomfortable so try to make people feel comfortable by being comfortable with yourself. I love socializing now and it got easier as time went on.
176090684,Good thought. But actually I have been on normal time these last 4 days. I think it‚Äôs just stress. You see I get hallucinations of burning smells but today one of the neighbours was burning some garden waste so there was a real smokey smell. This smokey smell has had me on edge all afternoon

176090687,"I was groggy this morning. From 11 on I‚Äôve felt like usual, I‚Äôm paranoid etc. I did get out of the house for an hour with my peer support specialist but we went to a place with very few people. She helped keep me focused on our conversation instead of doom and gloom and panic. I‚Äôm not tired or spacey. I‚Äôve already adjusted to it. But it didn‚Äôt stop my phone or computer from being tapped or men following me. It also hasn‚Äôt stopped me from seeing my ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù friends."

176090690,"I grew up in a religious environment, so I might be able to provide some input. To some faiths, sex is a holy act committed with the purpose of creating life, which in some faiths should only be created by people who intent to stay together. In other words, married folks who have gotten their blessings from God by being married at church. So in their eyes, extramarital sex is wrong because it hasn‚Äôt been blessed and could create a life that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily have two parents who live together."
176090691,From what I saw in society money is more important than being handsome. Personality is also more important than being handsome.
174365106,Why would I feel inferior? I don‚Äôt have psychological issues to do so. I just feel different than ppl who are able to work or who are able to live on their own. Schizophrenia doesn‚Äôt make you inferior. I was even able to get a physiotherapy degree while having severe schizophrenia with negative symptoms which sounds impossible. In many classes I had A‚Äôs. Some ppl are aliens like me while others are human
176090692,If they mean to do harm to you or those you love I‚Äôd tell them to buzz off. There‚Äôs enough negative energy out in the world so if you‚Äôre getting attacked by it you can either join it or stand up for yourself.

176090696,Yes I‚Äôm happy and have my interests and hobbies back and now have a boyfriend. However I take an anti depressant along with invega (sertraline) which really improved things for me. It‚Äôs a good combination for me. I hope I don‚Äôt have to change it. Only problem is I‚Äôve been gaining weight. Once my frozen shoulder is fixed I will probably start a sport like squash or tennis and loose some of it.

176090701,"I know it‚Äôs a delusion, but it feels so real that my ???? is being stolen whether willingly or unwillingly. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an accident. Like I strongly believe I wrote the short story ‚ÄúVariable Man‚Äù by _NAME_ in the future and they sent it back in time (Illuminati) and gave it to him. I got no credit. Oh Well. People think it‚Äôs a delusion. It‚Äôs also funny and I relate to the fact that some movies are extremely loosely based on my former lives and yet are entirely fiction. It ????? with me and my mind. No credit whatsoever. I also heavily fantasize and relate to these characters. I‚Äôm just worried if I write again, my stuff will be stolen like the letter _PERSON_ wrote in France about us living in a computer program. I believe I wrote that and I was one of the first to figure it out and paid the ultimate price. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm making sense here. Illuminati is a secret society of people or aliens that few if anyone believes in. It‚Äôs also possible I gave my stuff away or m

Like I even feel I came up with some bits of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology that _NAME_ says he and a fellow discovered or came up with or invented. Of course, it plays into my delusion that the British really won in the future circa 3000 AD and are sort of controlling and influencing us. That the Queen is an extremely power person in the world. Perhaps, the most powerful person alive. I just want honest work and some money and an honest paycheck. I just feel like I created _NAME_ mostly and that his life was ""Adjustment Bureau‚Äôd‚Äô by me and some others in a past life. He would have just been a footnote in history and as a protestor and communist. A little known sci-fi writer. I‚Äôm not bashing him. I care about him, but it makes me think sometimes. He‚Äôs one of the greatest story tellers of all time. I think I time traveled and met him and even told him about ‚ÄúMan in the High Castle‚Äù an

Now that I‚Äôm working on some of my, um, ‚Äúissues‚Äù and may have a girlfriend (still trying to figure it out it its real), I want my sex drive back.

176090723,"I tried without meds several times and it caused a lot of damage to me and my loved ones, because i did it in an uncautious way, impulsively and from a place of extreme fear of meds. I still have deep regrets when i look back. What CAUSED this fear in the first place though, was that they overdrugged me, nobody warned me of side effects and i got horrible responses and none of the doctors listened or cared. I now carefully withdrew to very, very little meds‚Ä¶and to this day i still doubt whether that is right or not. Barely using meds allowed me to be active, to work, to enjoy things, to feel, to think, to connect (a bit). To process and express and learn to deal with things i otherwise would have just numbed, denied and suppressed. It also makes me feel horrible at times. Paranoid, distrustful, fearful, guilty, withdrawn, overwhelmed. Though i ‚Äúwant‚Äù to feel these emotions if they are there‚Ä¶it is hard.

176090725,"Around August 27th 2011, I went crazy in college. Looking back, I think it was a simple alien abduction because I posted ‚ÄúWe live in the Matrix‚Äù. Ever since that, I‚Äôve been living countless lives in simulations and went sort of insane I think. Insane is a conversial word, but I feel like it. I think it was _NAME_ Base, New Mexico, an alien facility down there where they ‚Äòdo stuff‚Äô to people. They told me: aliens are real, we live in a simulation, and not to talk about the craft I saw in college. I thought there was a huge conspiracy against me and I‚Äôve been getting fake dreams and stuff of other fake lives and stuff that‚Äôs confusing me on this very simple issue: I was abducted be grey aliens and basically experimented on and possibly tortured. I thought it was the Illuminati or Shadow Government type stuff, but it‚Äôs not. They let _PERSON_ and others talk about simulation theory all the time, but I was one of the first to do it. I think. I don‚Äôt know if I got it from the tv show ‚Ä
úThrough the Wormhole with _NAME_‚Äù I probably did. But it wasn‚Äôt a mainstream idea. Same thing with _NAME_‚Äôs paper. He wasn‚Äôt even that popular or well known back then. I feel like they took and ran with my idea or even took it and were made famous, while all I got was schizophrenia and suffering and living a horrible, poor life of non-existence. Thoughts? There‚Äôs little to no proof of my existence even online. I think aliens are covering it up. I‚Äôve been living my life sort of on repeat since 2011 with schizophrenia for thousands of iterations of more. Possibly the simulation rebooted itself in 2011 after that post and a cover up insued. Thoughts? I feel like I‚Äôm getting clarity here."

176090735,"I‚Äôve had enough space from my delusions to the point where, until I‚Äôm actively having them, I don‚Äôt believe in them. Try to find a medication that gives you some time, to decompress. Think critically about your delusion‚Äôs structure, what it makes you think or question is real. Try to gain some insight into what parts are reasonable and what are, probably just irrational beliefs. Like, for instance alien life might be out there, UFOs are reported, but not proven to be extraterrestrial. Its fine to think that alien life is out there, but our scientists don‚Äôt seem to think that we‚Äôre being contacted, or at least the ones that do don‚Äôt have enough evidence to convince those that don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt sweat the small stuff. Try not to be afraid because of a delusion, try not to give it that power over you."

176090738,Thing is there are kids. Also this site isn‚Äôt 18+ so parental controls might not catch it. I like to think most people on this site wouldn‚Äôt walk up to a random minor and talk in depth about their sex life. What makes talking on a forum about it different? There are strict rules on this site regarding other sensitive topics like drugs alcohol and gambling. Threads on politics are normally shut down immediately. I just don‚Äôt get the opposition to keeping talk about sex properly labeled and kept in a recovery/health context.
176090739,"Not trying to trigger you guys, but I felt like I was an alien or android or mutant or something like that. Started in college like I got abducted by aliens.

176090766,"It‚Äôs a difficult process. What type of book are you trying to publish? A poetry or short story collection needs to have several singular publications in reputable journals, then the author needs to query small presses directly with a cover letter and usually a sample. With a novel, you may as well try for a BIG publisher, unless your work is extremely niche or literary, so pretty much essential with novels is querying an agent FIRST, who then submits your novel to publishers. Can‚Äôt do it without an agent. This costs nothing, and agents are open to any good author, but they will get 15% of your earnings. _USER_ID_ is a YouTuber who breaks down writing and publishing.

It‚Äôs been twenty years since we‚Äôve spoke. She emailed me back inviting me to _PERSON_ sometime, to which I did not respond immediately. And a little later she emailed me again trying to pin me down on a time when I wanted to _PERSON_. I felt uncomfortable. I‚Äôve never used _PERSON_ before and need some time to warm up to the idea.

I had a voices carrying on a conversation with his wife saying I had stage four breast cancer last fall so I went totally delusional and thought I was dieing every day. Then the nurse said it was blocked nodules and so did my aunt who is a CNA. It hurts around my menstrual cycle and under my arm hurts if I‚Äôm not active. It‚Äôs like I tense up. My mind automatically goes to lymph nodes and it‚Äôs metastatic. Then on July 3rd a voice was practically yelling at me and said the cancer is in my spine. I don‚Äôt know what to make of this. Is it voices and delusions? My old pdoc who used to be a obgyn P.A. said I didn‚Äôt have it because I‚Äôm too young and cancer doesn‚Äôt run in my family. So why do I still have that fear. Is the fear real?

I have been on 200mg during a long duration and with the time being it revealed to be a too low dosage. Apparently amisulpride is less effective at the same dosage with the time being.

If your primary reason for seeing a therapist is to get help with managing other things in your life (e.g. your MIL), then ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù, as long as she stays completely away from any discussion of schizophrenia symptoms, lest she go spinning off into new age la la land. I would also be concerned about her high rates ‚Äì didn‚Äôt you mention $250 in a previous thread and that she doesn‚Äôt take insurance? That‚Äôs really going to add up if you see her regularly.

Patients with SZ exhibited higher elevation of lactate than HCs during exercise but not at baseline or at rest. In accordance, patients showed higher number of CAMDs and lower mtDNA copy number. Interestingly, CAMDs correlated with both lactate levels and mtDNA copy number, which in turn correlated with the NLR. Finally, we identified 13 putative pathogenic variants in the mtDNA of 11 participants with SZ not present in HCs, together with a lactate elevation during exercise that was significantly higher in these 11 carriers than in the noncarriers."

176090957,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôm new here and was DX‚Äôd with SZ 6 years ago. I went through 5 years of denial and hoped that I did not have the condition and that my psychoses were simply caused by my cannabis habit and nothing else. Since then, I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed with bipolar type 1 because I convinced my doctor that I had it. Bipolar was the only other DX that made sense and I use to stigmatise the label of SZ. I recently went through 6 months of CBT and today, I am realising how much damage my three psychotic episodes have really done. It‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow. My last episode involved the end of a romantic relationship where gaslighting was involved. I am sometimes question my own perceptions due to the nature of SZ, and when the person you love makes you further question your mind. It‚Äôs not easy to process. The friend I relied on for support post-breakup was also an offender, in that they made me question my perceptions. That sort of stress could be what contributed to the precipitation of my 
last episode. Delusions are false beliefs, and if the people around you convince you to believe false beliefs, then what? I feel like I am rambling. Can any of you offer your thoughts? I should note that I do not have any positive symptoms when I am medicated."

One of the biggest parts of that was to deal with disagreements and keep my ego out of things. I have a responsibility to moderate my behavior regardless of my disorder.

You get a full 16 hour life out of the battery which I was impressed by, and they just bluetooth to my phone. Now I work outside, if I need to focus I just use the standard Apple wired headphones in one ear. They get crapped up pretty quickly Landscaping. The time I listen to loud music is in my _NAME_.

176091063,"Let me give you a dose of anthropology. Did you know that ‚Äúrace‚Äù is a product of human evolution, or mutations? During natural selection, few genes governing the look of our skin (i.e. skin colour) were mutated. Because of this, some individuals have white skin, some have yellow skin, and some have black skin. It‚Äôs not because of division or what you are saying here. About 100,000 years ago, humans (now known in haplogroups) have evolved from having one type of skin to numerous. And the evolution of human species thus resulted in diversity of skin colours. Some Finns (whom I share a common mutation with) have Asian, or Korean haplogroup DNA. And it has said that haplogroups originated from one side in East Asia and migrated to other lands and thus grouping themselves in ethnicity. What you are saying here about race is not correct. Please know that diversity is very important in genetic diversity. If we group ourselves in same ‚Äúraces‚Äù we may have genetic consequences. Thank you for your t

174365197,"You can do several things to raise motivation. Avoid or reduce pleasure giving activities like sex, watching movies, videos, sleeping during day time etc. Exercise, workout regularly. Do intermittent fasting and follow a keto diet if possible as these improve overall health and also very good for memory, concentration etc. Stick with a daily routine and follow it strictly whether feel like it or not. For example go to sleep at night and wake at regular time everyday. Not nap during day time and even if do make the total nap time less than 20 minutes. This way add small small daily routines which is useful. Concerning supplements which help with negative symptoms include vitamin D, thiamine (vitamin B1). These two supports dopamine indirectly. These needed to support dopamine conversion. Vitamin B12 is another great supplement for motivation and energy. Zinc deficiency can create lot of problems related to motivation so it too can help."

176091076,"To determine whether acute restoration of the activity of prefrontal projections to the paraventricular thalamus is sufficient to ameliorate sociability deficits in adult mice that underwent juvenile social isolation, the team employed a technique known as optogenetics to selectively stimulate the prefrontal projections to paraventricular thalamus. The researchers also used chemogenetics in their study. While optogenetics enables researchers to stimulate particular neurons in freely moving animals with pulses of light, chemogenetics allows non-invasive chemical control over cell populations. By employing both of these techniques, the researchers were able to quickly increase social interaction in these mice once light pulses or drugs were administered to them. ‚ÄúWe checked the presence of social behavior deficits just prior to stimulation and when we checked the behavior while the stimulation was ongoing, we found that the social behavior deficits were reversed,‚Äù said Dr. _PERSON_.

Then one day I‚Äôm talking with people from the future and cutting holes in the ceiling. I know they didn‚Äôt know what was going on but I spent a while angry at my family for not being there more.

On the other hand there is wife who is naturally controlling and does not want to obey or appreciate me. She is so stubborn that she feels absolutely negative about me. So i told her i might not talk to her at the same time will not divorce. Am I doing the right thing? Will it help in the long run? The pain and hurt she causes when she is with me in sight is so unbearable.

"" Court records state the drug makers failed to properly test Abilify; exaggerated the benefits of the drug; and encouraged physicians to use the medication for purposes not approved by the FDA. Abilify is not approved to treat anxiety disorders, dementia, eating disorders, insomnia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet, the makers of Abilify convinced doctors to try it for these conditions. The Key Legal Issues* The Abilify makers failed to warn doctors and patients of the connection between Abilify and compulsive behaviors. The Abilify makers hid evidence from the government when they got [FDA approval] The Abilify makers convinced doctors to prescribe Abilify for conditions not approved by the FDA.

174365235,"Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20732372/ Abstract Hyperprolactinemia is associated with typical antipsychotic agents and atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and amisulpride. This study investigates the effects of 8-week adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole in patients with hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone in comparison to benzamide antipsychotics (amisulpride and sulpiride). Aripiprazole was administered to 24 patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. The doses of pre-existing antipsychotics were fixed, while the aripiprazole dose was 5-20 mg/day during the 8-week study period. Serum prolactin levels were measured at weeks 4 and 8. Symptoms and side effects were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), _NAME_ Sexual Experience Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-_NAME_ Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, and metabolic measures at weeks 2, 4 and 8. Mean (standard error) prolactin levels decreased from 77.0¬±13.3 ng/mL to 18
.3¬±2.1 ng/mL (p<0.001 vs. baseline), from 144.9¬±24.4 ng/mL to 127.5¬±21.7 ng/mL (p=0.099 vs. baseline) and 71.4¬±24.6 ng/mL to 43.3¬±14.7 ng/mL (p=0.106 vs. baseline) for those taking risperidone, amisulpride, and sulpiride, respectively. For those who took risperidone before the study started, 14 of 15 (93.3%) patients had normalized prolactin levels, while only 1 of 10 (10%) taking benzamide antipsychotics had normalized prolactin levels. The PANSS score improved significantly, and aripiprazole had no significant influence on metabolic measures or scales of movement side effects. Adjunctive aripiprazole treatment reversed effectively hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone, but was less effective for that induced by benzamide antipsychotics."

176091291,"I has surgery in a doctor‚Äôs office not permitted to do actual surgery, it should have been done in a surgical hospital but this doctor told my mom, who was 24ish at the time and I was 10 almost 11 that it‚Äôd be ok. I weighed 40 pounds, and it took 4 adult bags of anesthesia to knock me out, I woke up 12 hours later at home, I wasn‚Äôt even made sure to wake up they just sent me home after all that med and a 2 hour surgery, and I heard voices and saw just horrible ????. He never told us what was used to knock me out. And when the board went after him for illegal surgical practice and a ton of violations, my records disappeared and he died during trial. So I have no idea what I can‚Äôt have if I never have surgery. And those records are gone. My pediatrician at the time just had his name, theboffice, and date of surgery and what the surgery was. But that‚Äôs all we have. The next year I ended up getting RSD and now am basically crippled, so my mom has been just apologizing more as I get worse from 
my sz. I got diagnosed as sz at 12 while in hospital for the RSD. I had many doctors say I was lying I had surgery until I showed them pictures of my legs both in cats, physical therapy records, and then the scars from surgery. Some took MRI‚Äôs to see if the Achilles tendons were cut, and they are, so I‚Äôm crazy but not a liar basically they have said. I never saw many of them again. Hell after being on a morphine pump at children‚Äôs hospital I didn‚Äôt have any other pain relief until I was pregnant with my 3rd child in 2006. They had me on 4 vicodin a day, then after the birth 4bpercocet a day. Few years later I went to a pain doc who had never heard of RSD so he said I wasn‚Äôt allowed pain meds at all. My GP put me on tramadol in 2009, and as of 2 months ago that‚Äôs all I‚Äôd been on now I‚Äôm on that and fentanyl patches. I‚Äôll be doing lidocaine IV infusions once they feel it‚Äôs safe to do it at the hospital in _NAME_, they have a very high Covid infection there, so this pain doc is just trying to 
keep me safe and he knows I have kids and a husband that have lung issues. But I have never touched drugs. Hell, when I smoked cigarettes it was 1/2 a cigarette every day. A pack lasted me forever, and that was age 13-16. _NAME_ asked me to quit, I never ever smoked around him because of his severe asthma so I stopped cold turkey. And I drink maybe a total of 5 or 6 times a year, and it‚Äôs 1 drink period. I got screwed by a bad doctor, and if we could have sued we would have if he survived his criminal trial. I feel gypped a lot because of him, he really took much of my life away."
176091292,What did you take that helped.
176091293,I got sectioned in September last year for being psychotic. Even though I was drunk on Bourbon I still got admitted for psychosis - forcibly injected again! I think it was down to the alcohol. Can you fake psychosis while drunk? Or maybe seem psychotic while drunk. For 3 weeks?
176091294,Damn. I still vape. A few moments ago I saw that there was an 8th death due to vaping reported in the U.S. so far 1 has been reported in Canada (to my knowledge). The thing that strikes me as peculiar is that most if not all of these deaths have involved people 31 years and younger. Many are below 25. That is worth noting. Something is clearly wrong.

174365236,"I have been diagnosed as high functioning because, I lack the flatness effect, mostly. I think people sometimes confuse ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù with the degree of absence of positive symptoms, almost always a result of an efficient response to anti psychotic medication. In my case, although a stranger would never think I lived with schizophrenia a review of my achievements after going acute versus before going acute would make it clear that I am not high functioning at all but merely without flatness effect. Or maybe it‚Äôs my negative symptoms which have been a big handicap all the way through this. So in summary if if I have a point to make I think the term ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù less defines a person living with schizophrenia than it describes, typically partially, a person living with schizophrenia."
176091296,Thinking people are reading your mind and want to kill you is not normal it doesn‚Äôt sound like the meds are working you may need to try a different med
176091297,That‚Äôs just a common delusion a lot of folks with sz believe in. The world is too big to focus on a single person. Espacially if the person has some mental stuff going on.

176091301,Tried to increase my amisulpride dose to 400mg but when I asked my pdoc here said it takes two weeks to kick in. How can it be so long? It seemed to be quicker in the past when I was in hospital. Woke up and lay in bed all morning. Feel awful. Alien laughed at me . Cut myself. Crying. Dead. So f***ing dead. Tried calling therapist but phone just rang. I‚Äôm so terribly alone‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ at least my husband is supportive now.
176091302,Be careful if you are going to quit. When I did that in the past I wasn‚Äôt able to see when I had relapsed before it was too late. It sneaks up on you and you start contemplating that it is the transition going back to normality. Don‚Äôt give yourself the benefit of the doubt if you feel something unpleasant or disturbing.
176091303,Talk business first. I have the same problem with my doc as we talk about the current state of Australian cricket but we talk the mental health first. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve a plan and your seeing them tomorrow. Hope you get it sorted out.

Maybe you can be friends but not married. Be firm yet kind . People can take rejection badly and it can make them cruel so be careful, firm , decisive and kind. I left the person I love most to be true to myself. I left to go on a vegan diet and because I couldn‚Äôt stand glue traps killing mice in cruel ways and to give my horse a better paddock. He wouldn‚Äôt let me go on a vegan diet because he thought it would make me sick. No one is to tell me what I can‚Äôt do not even my favourite man. I miss him and love him every day but I am true to myself and wanting to be myself and the person I want to be and no one should interfere with that.

174365233,"Try focusing on your feet while you walk and while you are sitting in class. At first It will be difficult, but it becomes easier to ignore voices, delusions, etc. It comes to a point where you almost stop suffering from the SZ/psychosis symptoms because you are too focused on your physical sensations (and one of the ways to maintain focused on your whole body is just focusing on your feet all day, then you start feeling every other part, just focus on your feet, and yo will start noticing the weight of every part of your body) It is also important to focus on maintaining your body relaxed, without any kind of tension, you can do this even if your mind is not relaxed, and one thing will lead to another. I visually hallucinated horrible things every day non stop for about 6 months, couldn‚Äôt look people in the eyes because I‚Äôd see disturbing stuff on their faces and when this happened I tend to have laughing fists and involuntary really exagerated grimaces, meds were not helping, and now I‚Äôm pe
rfectly fine just following the method above. A shaman taught me to do that. Psychiatrists don‚Äôt teach this sort of thing because they think you can only get better with medication, this knowledge (techniques such as the one I described) come from indigenous tribes, they have different methods for treating mental health problems. P.S.: I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äò‚Äòdon‚Äôt take your meds‚Äô‚Äô, I‚Äôm saying there are other methods when meds are not enough or when the side effects are too much to handle"

176091326,this is my favorite
176091327,I told my nurse i used a drug when i saw her earlier today. I am still learning so I didn‚Äôt know if i could trust her.
176091328,Yes. Never be embarrassed to talk about something like that with a doctor or nurse. We have heard and seen it all. And it is important to you and significantly affecting you. Not telling your treatment team important info like that can harm you and doesn‚Äôt let us do our jobs. And that is a very common side effect. If a patient told me that I wouldn‚Äôt even blink.
176091329,I agree with your peer keep at it!
176091330,Threads about hallucinations belong in the unusual beliefs section. It‚Äôs in the category description.
174365253,"In my experience, if i had known the possibility that the abilify was causing me mood symptoms and irritability i would have talked to the doctor long time ago‚Ä¶ i ended up being prescribed a mood stabaliser a few weeks ago, seems to be helping a bit."

174365240,"I think that‚Äôs going to depend on you. It‚Äôs hard to shake things off when you have Anhedonia and lack of motivation. I haven‚Äôt been able to push past them yet. But then again, I have schizophrenia, not just psychosis. I was on invega too and hoped that switching drugs would change things but I still have Anhedonia and lack of motivation‚Ä¶no interest in things, so I dunno. I still hope to get better but I keep hoping something will change and my negative symptoms will get better, although I don‚Äôt really expect them to on their own. I dunno, maybe I‚Äôm the wrong person to ask. Maybe I‚Äôm just not pushing myself enough. Switching drugs did make me feel less drugged up but the negative symptoms still seem to persist. I feel stuck myself. What Mr _PERSON_ said is probably true but that ‚Äúhard work‚Äù that is required is hard to muster up with lack of motivation. I wish you the best on your recovery though."
176091332,Pdoc appointments are important. Best keep it if you can. Health needs to be looked after
176091333,I‚Äôve seen my brain on a scan and my ventricles aren‚Äôt enlarged but are asymmetric. It‚Äôs about symptoms anyways. It‚Äôs unusual to see differences which is why sz is hard to diagnose. It‚Äôs diagnosed over symptoms over time. I don‚Äôt do voices but occasionally hear music but I have a central voice/thought that comments on everything I do. It‚Äôs like paranoia. It can be so subtle and for me that will mean why do people say what they are saying‚Ä¶It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean everyone is out to get me. It can be a lot more complex.

176091337,"I take Geodon and Seroquel, and that is a combination that has kept me more or less on track. Some people don‚Äôt like Seroquel, but I have no problem with it."
176091338,Good question but if you know your delusions aren‚Äôt real or doubt they are real then it could be related to OCD. But if you have no insight into your delusions then it‚Äôs most likely related to a psychotic disorder.
176091339,Last night I overheard my pdoc and his receptionist in trouble but I did not do anything I wish I could have called the police at least. The people doing this to me were telling me what they were doing. I could not sleep. And they said they are after me today I hope my pdoc and his receptionist are ok. I am so sad for them. If they were ok I would doubt all my voices and not have to worry too much.

174365242,"Im on three antipsych meds. Ive been steady on medication since september. I still have paranoia and delusions during some parts of my day. I end up thinking the same: ‚Äúthe meds dont help completely, thus not schizophrenic‚Äù. However you need to keep in mind two things: Meds take time, ideally they need 6 months to have absolute full effects, and you may not be on the right med. Some symptoms will never go away no matter what AP or dosage you‚Äôre on. You should check out a _NAME_ talk on youtube, search ‚Äúschizophrenia im not a monster‚Äù. This smart and educated young lady talks about schizophrenia and how it affects her. She says that even though shes on medication, she was hallucinating while giving the talk. Shes inspirational, and definitely helped me in a variety of ways. I really hope you can trust your pdoc, and continue to take the meds. I know its hard, stay strong.

I‚Äôm doing it because I‚Äôm genuinely confused about my illness! Why did he not understand?? They should not let people become pdocs unless they know someone close to them with mental illness - or have it themselves. Because some of them don‚Äôt seem to understand.

I have been discriminated based on my illness since some people think it is their right to abuse those who are weaker or ill. I am a better person because of these experiences. I could have become malcontent and ragingly mad against society because of those who treated me badly. But, I accept my illness as a ‚Äúthorn in my side.‚Äù I see life in a positive manner still. I never give up believing in a better tomorrow. Life is good, may be not grand, but ok. I know I am blessed when I think of others who have suffer more than I do. I could feel sorry for myself too. Some of these people who triumphed over their suffering are my inspiration. They are my brothers and sisters in suffering. I think of them when I feel sorry about my illness. I sometimes wonder if life could be better? Or, life is the best it is with what I have. I think the latter is 
true for me. Thus, I am blessed with life for having sz/sza."

But, we really go back as far as about February or March 1998 when we took a course about mental illness together. Flash forward to this Tuesday and our facilitator mentioned that he‚Äôd really been lonely since the start of the pandemic and wanted to make new friends. She had already mentioned my name and today, he went walking with us after lunch. To make a long story short, we exchanged phone numbers at the end of the walk. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs Presbyterian if I remember correctly, even though I‚Äôm agnostic. But, that‚Äôs not a big deal as we‚Äôve gotten along well in the past."

176091409,"oh man ive been there. just try to ignore it. heres my theory on why we hear the voice of god or jesus or the devil. first at some point in your life you were into religion or still are. then your brain which is dysfunctional ends up in a psychosis. So it pulls information from your mind such as the religious ideas , and twists them up and brings them out in voice form. It feels like you are special, like your chosen, kind of like a prophet. a special mission. So it seems like wow what an exciting life, i get to experience this. but in reality its just auditory hallucinations pulling from your mind on whatever you have been focusing on in recent months. You have also probably thought about medications in some way and probably about life and death too. so it brings it all twisted up in voice form. So my strategy has been, no matter what the voices say or claim to be, good or bad just ignore them and let them pass by like the wind. cheers"

And that genetic trait was passed from generations to generations.

174365275,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Novel Treatment for the hardest-to-treat Schizophrenia: Dual Activation of NMDA Receptor and Antioxidant. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Current drug targets , Oct 2019 11 Clozapine has been regarded as the last-line antipsychotic agent for patients with refractory schizophrenia. However, many patients remain unresponsive to clozapine, referred to as ""clozapine-resistant"", ""ultra-treatment-resistant"", or ""hardest-to-treat"". There has been no convincing evidence for augmentation on clozapine so far. Novel treatments including numerous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) enhancers such as glycine, D-serine, D-cycloserine, and N-methylglycine (sarcosine) failed in clinical trials. Earlier, Inhibition of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) that may metabolize D-amino acids and thereby activate NMDAR has been reported to be beneficial for patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotics except clozapine. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial f
ound that add-on sodium benzoate, a DAAO inhibitor, improved the clinical symptoms in patients with clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, possibly through DAAO inhibition (and thereby NMDAR activation) and antioxidation as well; additionally, sodium benzoate showed no obvious side effects, indicating the treatment is safe at the doses up to 2 g per day for 6 weeks. More studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of sodium benzoate for the treatment of schizophrenia and thereby the etiology of this severe brain disease. If the finding can be reconfirmed, this approach may bring new hope for the treatment of the most refractory schizophrenia. This review summarizes current status of clinical trials and related mechanisms for treatment-resistant, especially, clozapine-resistant schizophrenia.

176091514,My theory is that schizophrenia is actually quite a few different illnesses which makes a cure harder to find. There needs to be multiple treatments for multiple disorders

176091516,Or so you think?
176091517,"I guess there is something to labeling theory. I still spend most days over 23 hours in bed, I‚Äôve been sleeping less and less, drinking more and more, and I haven‚Äôt cleaned my room since I moved in 9 months ago.

My concentration and memory are slowly returning to pre-onset levels, I‚Äôm greatly enjoying reading and watching movies and spending time with my loved ones with whom I continue to have a great relationship. I barely have symptoms. My ‚Äúunusual beliefs‚Äù are just that, and perhaps not even that, because they are not that unusual, and they are no more than half-beliefs with no power in my everyday life.

176091522,"In a sense we all are the ‚Äúone true self‚Äù, only that we operate in different time frames and are brought together by the devil through fake simultaneity."
176091523,It was tremendous fear. I feared the plot against me was there to make me insane and to be the proof that I was indeed crazy. The anxiety was unbearably. It was so bad I wanted to cut myself open. I asked the psychiatrist on my first appointment what is wrong with me. She said I had delusional paranoia. I was baffled cause I thought the entire world was delusional and I was the only one sane one because of all the emmotional agony I went through. I tried so many many things to get rid of my pain. I quit drinking and smoking hoping it would help if I walk the straight and narrow. I actively participated it church activities to get my soul ready. It all didn‚Äôt help. I was so confused but still believed I was right in all my actions. At least it was better for my physical health to cut the cigs and booze. I put cameras everywhere in and around my house to catch the stalkers. I sat nights through watching camera footage of cars driving by etc. My emmotions as a result of my delusions and paranoia was 
hell itself.

No use crying over spilled milk so it‚Äôs living and liking what you do. I‚Äôve good friends and wonderful family and I can‚Äôt complain. I have enough money to spend a little if not a lot but it‚Äôs enough! For me being diagnosed meant healing mentally. I got over paranoia. It no longer rules my life and medications give me enough stability to live large. So yes. I like how you put it‚Ä¶I‚Äôve found positive meaning through mental illness!

176091587,How‚Äôs the garcinia been working for you _AT_MENTION_? Saw it at the pharmacy and was tempted to pick some up.
176091588,"Understandable, and a tough spot. First thing is meds every day, that‚Äôs worrisome, good thinking to go back on them. They may need some time to adjust back to normal levels. You may want talk to your doctor about an evaluation on your meds, have you ever thought about the abilify jab? The ennui comes next, it sounds like you need something to shake up your routine. This is more complicated with the state of the world. Once herd immunity is reached and things open back up, I think it may help. It can be a grind, it can be a bore, and It can all become tedious. Your fight is good though, instead of wallowing in it you‚Äôre asking for help, that‚Äôs a good sign. Nature can help. Hobbies can help. Spoiling yourself with something nice and new. What does a day of tuna isolation look like? Is it just hanging out with anhidonia? Be safe tuna."

I cant find much about tis atpical mood stabilizer. Has anyone tried it and seen benefits? what were its upsides and downsides? What has worked for you to feel more like you have an active part in life?
176091594,"Thanks! Yeah, I have a feeling there is very much a routine to it. Just gotta get that down."

176091599,"The problem is you are letting that tiny 0.1% evidence that something supernatural is happening rule your world, while you ignore all the other evidence that you just live a normal life like your neighbour. I mean think about it. All your thoughts are probably making a case to back up your delusion. You need to start making a case that you are just a average _NAME_, and no one is out to get you. Your brain will probably scream when you try because it‚Äôs used to the delusion, but you really need to flip over the other way."

176091608,"You have to take care of your drug problem. You have to quit sometime so do it now and get it over with. Drugs are a dead end. Drugs take a toll in obvious ways, they wreck your mind, your health, and drain money that you could be spending elsewhere on something productive or something good for you. I was addicted to crack from 1986-1990. My life revolved around getting and using drugs. I never had a knife or gun pulled on me but lots of f*cked up stuff happened to me. I almost permanently wrecked my life because of my drug use. It cost me jobs, it almost ruined my health, it almost made me lose my family and I lost just about every one of my meagar possessions because I sold or traded them for crack. I had embarrassing, humiliating things happen to me. I knocked on all my dads neighbors doors and borrowed money by making up bulls*it stories that made them give me money. The neighbors fell for it for awhile but then they complained to my dad and it embaressed him and me. I begged for drugs. Anyways
, you know the drill, you know the messed up things that happen in your life due to drugs. But in 1990 I started going to AA. I was living in a group home and I wandered downstairs one night and discovered a small AA meeting being held in the kitchen. I wa invited to join so I sat in and the people were really cool and no one bugged me and I just sat there and listened. I started going regularly even though I drank in between meetings. But one night I was laying upstairs in my room and I hadn‚Äôt smoked crack in a few weeks but all of a sudden the craving, obsession and compulsion to use hit me full force. My brain went tinto drug addict mode and I made the plan to get up early and take the bus for an hour and half to my parents friends house and borrow a hundred dollars and then take the bus two hours to get some crack. I had this anticipatory high just laying there planning for tomorrow. But you know what? I fell asleep but when I woke up the next morning my first thought was my plan. But a second later I t
hought, ‚ÄúThat was crazy‚Äù and overnight the compulsion and obsession to use that I had for four years was gone. I felt at peace. I think what happened was all the good stuff I heard in those meetings had planted a seed in my brain of recovery and the knowledge I had heard in so many meetings had been imprinted in my brain and wiped out the desire to use. Well, it‚Äôs 29 years later and I have had no cravings or desire to do drugs or drink this entire time. I don‚Äôt miss drugs, I never miss drugs. And I started going to meetings regularly; I found other meetings within walking distance or I caught the bus and soon I was going to at least 5 meetings a week. And then my life just blossomed. I became employable again. I enrolled myself in college. I made a couple of friends and me and a friend would go to meetings together or onweekends we would take the bus to the record store or to a movie. My family started trusting me again. I didn‚Äôt have to hide my whereabouts anymore or I didn‚Äôt have to lie about wh
ere my money was going. I started going to my sisters house on weekends and doing fun things like going to the beach or to comedy clubs etc. AA, CA and NA work. THey kept me clean. There are othe ways to get cleanbut AA is free and not only helps stop drugbusage but they teach you anhonest, way to live by following a few simple principlils. AA is a good place to socialize and even make friends. I have heard so many stories by addicts and alcoholics in AA about people who had done drugs for twenty years or more but they still got clean and sober in AA. From over a thousand meetings I have learned that no one is to far gone or hopeless. It doesn‚Äôt matter what drugs you use, how much drugs you use, how long you have used: you can still get clean. I shared my story so that maybe you can relate and maybe you found something in it that can help you. I‚Äôve sat in rooms with people who had been in prison for years or slept in a pool of their own urine on the sidewalk in broad daylight passed out or women who had s
old themselves for that fix. They did those things for twenty years but then they tell how they quit and became responsible, sober, productive members of society for the past 5, 10, 25 years. I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about AA, CA, and NA. I will leave you with this last thought: It is not impossible to quit drugs. I hope you got something from this and have a nice night."
176091609,"When I think of the word lazy I think of people who don‚Äôt attempt things that I attempt. But there are reasons why they don‚Äôt attempt those same things. I think the word lazy is a terrible word. Negative symptoms has a spectrum of severity. Again there are reasons for it, one being the medication‚Ä¶"
174365316,My dr said everyone has unique brain chemistry & some dont need that much. He said he has seen people stable on 2mg & 5mg! Theres a girl on YouTube named amateur aries that takes 2 mg.
176091610,"That depends on what your job is, I guess, and what your boss would think of it. If work is stressing you out, maybe you could ask if you can work a bit less?"
176091611,I honestly don‚Äôt know if it is true or not
174365319,"Extremely common. With disorganized schizophrenia some can be more social, albeit strange. But with paranoid schizophrenia social avoidance is almost always a symptom. I know it is for me. I won‚Äôt even cut my grass but once a month because I don‚Äôt want my neighbors to see me. Let alone go out into public unless I need to. Which is usually once a day just to eat. I get paranoid and anxious at the grocery store so I haven‚Äôt been in months. I usually just go out to eat. But, yeah, social isolation is very common."
176091612,"So what you are saying is that you believe schizophrenics are dangerous then, especially without medication, thus you hear a voice ‚Äúkill‚Äù even on meds. If you didn‚Äôt believe it, or no longer believe it the voice could change. I am not saying positive thinking alone. I am talking about a whole change of mindset and life action to alter your unconscious outlook."
174365326,"Yes you can easily lose sense of what reality is, and lose control of your mind which is the main reason to take the stinking pills."
176091613,"The theory is: your brain produces too much dopamine. And you are on dopamine inhibitors. So imagine you have your foot on the gas and on the brake at the same time. When you take your foot off the brake, what happens? That is what you‚Äôre going through when you stop a medication, esp of you don‚Äôt taper it off slowly, as recommended. You should also keep in touch with your pshrink while you do this, though I‚Äôm sure you are. Remember that it will look like a relapse for awhile. I successfully quit Invega, and I had the same reasons; I was too flat to function. Negative symptoms everywhere. A zombie. It took a year or so for that to go away, but I should file the disclaimer that I was tapering UP on another med at the same time (Abilify). I was able to stop Abilify for awhile, too, with no meds at all. But I was still under care of my pshrink, and my support system knew about it. If my father hadn‚Äôt died and the pandemic wasn‚Äôt so stressful, I would still be maintaining without meds. But tha
t‚Äôs not always possible. I am back on 10 mgs of Abilify, but I plan to one day function without them. And that‚Äôs not to say I wasn‚Äôt without symptoms. But the symptoms were manageable and I could function. Therapy was the help. I went through extensive trauma therapy to control anxiety and stress, which both play huge roles for me in my psychosis. It untangled triggers from my schizophrenic brain, and things got easier ‚Äì even when I‚Äôm in psychosis. I should add that this took YEARS before I was able to try going off my meds. Remember recovery doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre cured, or that you won‚Äôt have symptoms. It just means you‚Äôre able to live your life to the best of your ability with a sense of stability. I wish you the best. I hope my story helps you keep hope."
176091614,Scary as hell‚Ä¶ Half the the time you can‚Äôt figure out what is real and what isn‚Äôt and when you do you have to question it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like there is someone after you and your only escape is meds but even those aren‚Äôt 100% and there is part of you saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need these meds‚Äù yet if you‚Äôre lucky you can fend it off

176091622,"Don‚Äôt read the family forum. Just don‚Äôt. I tried to offer help to people there as someone with sz and it was sad the stuff they asked.

176091624,"There are so many gradations of my anger, but the last time I felt really, really angry was in the mental hospital. I had just come in, and I saw this ad on tv about donating to Amnesty International, a human rights organization. I believed my human rights had been violated, so I decided to call them. When I did call they kept telling me to quit calling them. So then I finally said, ‚ÄúWe have _NAME_ here, and we‚Äôre going to shoot him in the head if you don‚Äôt pay attention to my case.‚Äù (_NAME_ was the leader of the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. I figured that because they worked for Amnesty International they would know who _NAME_ was, but if they did know they gave no indication of it.) So, after I hung up the psych nurse called me back to this room. She had a mental health aid with her. She told me in this very syrupy, sweet voice that I had threatened someone with violence, and because of that she was going to put me on Haldol. I don‚Äôt really hate a lot of things, but I loathed that 
drug. I was so angry that she was doing this to me. I tried to explain to her that _NAME_ was the leader of a foreign country, and there was no way I could have actually hurt him, or anyone else, but she stuck to her position. Like I said, I was livid. I told her that I was going to remember this, and I was going to remember her. (That came out more violent than I intended. I didn‚Äôt include acts of violence in the way I would remember her. I was thinking more in terms of a social snub, or something like that.) When I left the hospital they took me took an assisted living center where I behaved like a pernicious ass."
176091625,"I had this problem, but the medication seemed to do a good job of correcting this issue. For me it got to a point where I could not communicate with other people all. Maybe it would be worth going to your healthcare provider and write down some of your experiences, and see if they can help with any mjed adjustment?"
176091626,My nurse practitioner raised my remeron up to 30mg. He didn‚Äôt say that I recall that he was going to raise it up to 30mg. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt hear him right. Anyone here take a high dose of remeron?
176091627,Sorry just saw this. Yes I do have the crisis line I suppose but for me all they have done is told me to breathe‚Ä¶ maybe they‚Äôd do more for psychosis

Blocking muscarinic M1 receptors reduced the firing of neurons involved in working memory, while activating the M1 receptors helped restore neuronal firing. Because acetylcholine actions at M1 receptors are reduced in schizophrenia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, the M1 receptor may serve as a potential therapeutic target, the authors suggest. _PERSON_ notes that a drug currently under development for the treatment of schizophrenia stimulates this M1 receptor and has shown promise in early clinical trials. medicalxpress.com Researchers find key to keep working memory working Working memory, the ability to hold a thought in mind even through distraction, is the foundation of abstract reasoning and a defining characteristic of the human brain.

174365351,No one wants the pills but if you need em you need them. I take pills for a number of things. They don‚Äôt always equate to each other but you develop symptoms you need addressing then you need to take them regardless of your will or desire. We all go into taking psych pills thinking they are a short term option. Sadly for the majority of us it isn‚Äôt something we have a choice about. Just follow the medical advice and move from there. We all do it.

176091757,"I fired 2 pdocs cause they were just pill shovers and did some pretty horrible ???? for people knowing about how MI works. Those were 2 different health systems. Now the one I got rid of in my current health system, my therapist is same company, which is also my insurance company Mercy so my therapist filed complaints against that last pdoc. We finally got her outsted and she said that woman didn‚Äôt treat just me like I couldn‚Äôt make my own decisions. But my therapist had me added as top of list when a new prescriber was hired, who I see now _NAME_. She came from the psych ward at the hospital 3rd shift and decided she‚Äôs do better at preventive care, if that makes sense, not sure if that came out how I wanted. She wanted to basic keep people out of the hospital, and she and I hit it off really well. Cause she read my whole case before I came in first appointment, but I brought _NAME_ because of last pdoc. But she saw some really disrespectful notes in file from previous pdoc before my file was 
locked from her access, and told me what all was written. So that kinda earned my respect, then she asked how I felt I was going with no AP since March, I told her how I have voices still and hallucinate, but never had an AP ever help with those. So she talked to _NAME_, not like talking past me, but what he sees, he gave his input. She agreed as long as wasn‚Äôt worse, that we‚Äôd roll with it. But she is waiting for _PERSON_ to get the info for doctors about the FDA approved new med, and once she‚Äôs able to RX it we‚Äôre trying it. I‚Äôm one of those people, you get 1 shot at first appt, don‚Äôt treat me like I‚Äôm inhuman and we‚Äôll be ok. Those 2 i got rid of, should not be in the field, but when areas have too much need, bottom of barrel becomes standard. Good luck with new pdoc appointment, get your questions ready, but your gut feelings are usually best for you. Stand your ground on what matters to you, if no med changes, you stay with it. If you want a change, get it, etc."

Cilia are small hair-like structures found on the surface of many cells. They are critical for embryonic development, and many genetic defects in cilia simply halt development altogether. Cilia are present throughout the brain on the surface of neurons, and several genetic studies have hinted at links between cilia mutations and psychiatric illness. But, according to _PERSON_, the precise role of cilia in the brain is unclear, especially after development."

At the beginning of my psychosis I refused to eat for extended periods of time for this reason, and when I did eat, I felt like worst scum in the universe. Once, after a week without food, I cut two tomatoes. As I did so, I cried hysterically and begged them for forgiveness, because I could not control my sensation of hunger.

Varenicline has been identified as a potential treatment option for nicotinic receptor dysfunction with a potential to treat cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.We conducted a systematic review of Pubmed, Embase, Psycinfo, CINAHL and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Trial Registry for randomised controlled trials of varenicline in people with schizophrenia for cognitive dysfunction. We excluded trials among people with dementia. We then undertook a _NAME_-analysis with the primary outcome of difference in change of cognitive measures between varenicline and placebo as well as secondary outcomes of difference in rates of adve
rse events. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on smoking status and study duration.We included four papers in the _NAME_-analysis (n = 339). Varenicline was not superior to placebo for overall cognition (SMD = -0.022, 95% CI -0.154-0.110; Z = -0.333; p = 0.739), attention (SMD = -0.047, 95% CI -0.199-0.104; Z = -0.613; p = 0.540), executive function (SMD = -0.060, 95% CI -0.469-0.348; Z =- 0.290; p = 0.772) or processing speed (SMD = 0.038, 95% CI -0.232-0.308; Z = 0.279; p = 0.780). There was no difference in psychotic symptoms, but varenicline was associated with higher rates of nausea. Sensitivity analyses for smoking status and study duration did not alter the results.Within the present literature, varenicline does not appear to be a useful target compound for improving cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Based on these results, a trial would need over 2500 participants to be powered to show statistically significant findings."

I‚Äôm deathly afraid of spiders anyway and a black widow is just terrifying to me. She stopped right in front of me and my ex said you should back away she‚Äôs moving closer and I tried to move but I couldn‚Äôt. Finally I was able to reach my hand backwards to the screen door to slide it open to try to take a step backwards and her web was attached to my hair so she moved with me.

176091902,Here‚Äôs a song about that very subject!
176091903,"I have a bad story with morphine. When I broke my elbow I had a surgery and had a lot of morphine to ease of the pain. Immediately after I left the hospital I started hearing voices, which then started my psychotic episode that lasted for a few months"
176091904,"Well, what you don‚Äôt know about money; you can learn. I hate to say it (and this is only my opinion) but you did not come off very good. You did not present yourself as very responsible. But you can learn. I mean I‚Äôve been managing my own money for many years, probably more than thirty years and I made many mistakes too. I‚Äôve taken care of my bills pretty well, and I never starve for the most part but I‚Äôve run up thousands of dollars in credit card debt at several periods of my life and only got out of debt by luck and my dads help. Right now I‚Äôm just cruising, I‚Äôve had at least a couple grand in my checking account since October of 2019. I only have a couple recurring bills and I have to buy gas for the car and food and rent of course. But just four years ago I got myself into debt because of credit cards, I owed about seven thousand dollars. And my income is SSDI and a part time job. I got out of debt only because I started getting groceries for free from a local food bank. After rent
, food is my biggest expense. I was saving like two hundred dollars a month by getting free groceries and vegetables. I got a couple raises at work and started making two or three hundred dollars each month on my credit card debt. I also got a few hefty tax refunds which went toward my debt. I thought I would be in debt for ten or more years. Oh yeah, I don‚Äôt know how I almost forgot this but I was paying more than a hundred and fifty dollars in just interest payments each month so I transferred my big balances to a couple cards that offered 0% monthly interest for like 18 months. That was a huge step in paying those down. Anyways, yeah, I‚Äôve made many mistakes with money but just got lucky like cashing in my 401k early and putting it towards my debt. My step-dad also used to give me a hundred dollars a month. Sorry for digressing, I was just trying to show by experience how having your own money can go. Setting up a debit card is not the most difficult thing. The bank does most of the work and they‚Äôll 
walk you through it. Like I said, you can learn how to manage money, lots of people have the same problem."

176091915,"Hearing voices means that your subconscious mind has ‚Äòvocalised‚Äô what you expect to hear. If you have low self worth then the voices are more likely to be negative. If you are in a positive frame of mind and value yourself then the voices can be positive. There are no spirits, aliens etc, but if you have been brainwashed/indoctrinated into religion as a child then the voices can be interpreted in this way by such a person. For example, if you are fascinated by sci-fi as a person at whatever age you are more likely to believe the voices are aliens and have implant delusions, If you are hearing as you say what other people generally think, it is in fact what you think subconsciously. There is no such thing as legitimate thought broadcasting. That is what the psychiatrist should inform you about and help you to manage them better, probably with meds if this is a permanent thing and it is destroying your life."
176091916,I don‚Äôt have to explain anything. I live my life not anybody to understand. I tried already to explain but it seems the doctors make the wrong conclusion. People only hear and understand what they want. The voices are part of my brain. Maybe from the subconscious. Like I have visions of blockbuster movies I see much later on tv or cinema. Perhaps from the collective consciousness.

174365387,what dosages of olazapine and fluoxetine were you on? did your doctor think maybe increasing antipsychotic dosage and lowering modafinil dose would help? why do you think it worked fine for 2 years then a bad reaction so much later on? did your antipsychotic dosages change? it don‚Äôt understand why the reaction happened so much later on?

Ever since I started fasting major delusion that I would repeatedly have seem to be slowly going away and hallucinations are becoming less. I‚Äôm not sure why but I think it‚Äôs because of the fasting. _PERSON_ anyone know why fasting helps if it is or is it just because I am taking my antipsychotics at night as well as that are there any people who are fasting with the same experience?

I think one of the most important things in life, not just in regards to mental illness but in regards to literally any major life struggle, is to NEVER become complacent in your suffering. Fight, fight, fight for improvement to your situation. Because if you don‚Äôt there is 100% chance things will never get better. The ONLY way things improve is if you are willing to fight for it and persist. I‚Äôve battled my symptoms for as long as I can remember so that‚Äôs nearly 2 and a half decades now and just now I am recovered. Whose to say in another 15 years if you wont be recovered? Does it suck that it could take so long? Yeah. But better that than never better at all."

174365394,Yeah I honestly hope it work for you. I‚Äôve just done similar things with other meds or supplements thinking its gonna fix everything only to be let down. I really thought modafinil would help my negative symptoms and I was very dissapointed when it didnt help. same with other stims they were just making things worse. antidepressants didnt work either. but Rtms has helped me but again not a magic fix. and ive been managing my illness for 12 years. so I just didn‚Äôt want you to feel too dissapointed if it doesn‚Äôt solve everything. The staying bed all day can be somewhat fixed by tricking yourself with checklists and micro goals. like as simple as make a coffee make another coffee work on some activity of your choice for 5 minutes I have a cool checklist my girlfriend made for me for my course study it shows Math: 5 Minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 1 hour its all small increment so that I‚Äôm not overwhelmed with getting started. I‚Äôm pretty convinced that people with sz or sza bipolar et

176091944,When I was on latuda in the mornings I would pretty much almost be drewling at the gym with heavy eyes and the instructor on several occasions noticed and asked if I‚Äôm ok but now I only take latuda at night and it has helped so much.

Unfortunately I have been sick with urinary problems so hope to get help with that ASAP because I‚Äôm in constant pain and discomfort but will try to exercise.
174365398,I say Clozapine and Ziprasidone! They‚Äôve worked quite well for me.

We are already rich, its like having one million in hand and searching for safe place. Even millioners have security for a reason. But dopomine is released only after a million is reached not for us though. I feel this is the only reason I fail in achieving goal where the brain already release dopamine with no reason. If common people had to plan and harm you they should have millioners mind set. Because we think in CIA levels. Hope it made sense, because now again my mood is elevated."

176091965,I think the internet sometimes turns you into a troll. I‚Äôve used such tactics in the past to make a point. Probably not the best approach but you give and you take.
176091966,Are these voices or real People? I have People in my head too.
174365399,"No, I‚Äôm still on 30mg Abilify daily. Is that crazy, though? Hearing voices is crazy. I want to welcome the darkness back into my life. I want to be part of something greater than myself again."
176091967,What makes me think they‚Äôre NOT real?
176091968,"I hear you _PERSON_. But I know. And so do the others on this forum. Dont worry about what other people say about you. Let them go through what you experience every day and then ask them if you are lazy. Thats why I take my meds but no longer think that my psychiatrist knows anything about what he calls my ‚Äòdelusions‚Äô. Just because HE doesnt experience them doest mean they are not real. They are real and they take a lot of mental energy to deal with. So start with meditating on your awareness of ‚ÄúI am‚Äù. Dont force yourself to think any thoughts. Just be aware of your reality. Do it the next time you are free. Even now if you can. Even if your voices start talking during it. When you go through horrible suffering, it also makes even the tiniest good time feel great. Believe in yourself and you will get there. I had low self esteem for a long time. I was a 30 year whose 60 year old parents were still taking care of him. But when I offered to help around the house with chores and stuff, they w
ouldnt let me help because they were afraid the stress would make me go bad. That was silly but their fears were making them do that. I am a lot less paranoid about my sz than they are. In fact, my doc spends about 5 mins with me and about 20 mins with my family during appointments. Start with belief in yourself. From there, you can get through anything."

I recognise in myself those symptoms that lead others to diagnose me with a mental health disorder. I understand their reasoning and accept the facts, but I strongly dispute their interpretation of them. This is doubly odd because I‚Äôm not even appealing to anttipsychiatry or social constructionism to deny that I am schizophrenic.

By the end of this year or even before my net worth is going to be $100,000 plus which was a lot of work, discipline and staying towards my course of having a million in the bank account so I can quit work.

We finally had that appointment yesterday. I was already aware that the psychiatrist wouldn‚Äôt be able to recommend that she take the tablets from a medical point-of-view - he just wanted to hear her say that she understood what the tablets were, and why she was taking them. Everytime I have seen her over the past few weeks she said, ‚Äúyes, I will take the tablets‚Äù - despite still being in denial about her illness, so what did she say yesterday infront of the psychiatrist, her care worker and the manager of the carehome? ‚ÄúNo, I will not take the tablets because I don‚Äôt have schizophrenia.‚Äù The psychiatrist wasn‚Äôt convinced 
she was capable of understanding the situation, and even the manager of the carehome refused to store the tablets or even ask her staff to administer the tablets, because they are not UK/EU certified. I am soooo angry and disappointed right now having got my hopes up so much (I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have!) All I want to do is try something that MAY help her massively, but now I can‚Äôt even do that.

I don‚Äôt know how on earth I survived or even managed to get that contained in my room without screaming. A friend was helping me as I was struggling to keep the bugs off of me and I was choking while the hallucinations pressed my neck. Ever since then, I started to have hallucinations that is almost 24/7 these days. Daily life is becoming challenging. I always assume that a recovery phase from a break would be two months because I always end up in the hospital for two months. I just decided to write a diary here to keep myself updated and perhaps tell you guys also about it. I got this. I will beat this."

Some questions are built out of abstractions and can only be answered through abstractions like imaginary numbers in mathematics. If you can‚Äôt apply what you know it has zero value. If you don‚Äôt exist how do you poop in the toilet? To be lost in abstactive thought all day long cheats you from understanding concrete thought. If you study philosophy, the discipline, eventually turns into religion; to have application of thought instead of abstraction, that‚Äôs why they have pastoral psychiatry not philosophical psychiatry. Development is the process of a living species otherwise people would live simple lives of relatively no function or purpose. ie A single cell organism. It‚Äôs harder to learn concrete information because it‚Äôs typically doled out with time constraints to learn it so you don‚Äôt study one thing forev

176092308,"I worked at the Library from May, 1995, to the end of December 2016 mainly as a volunteer although there was between a one to 2 year period I worked there as a part-time employee under the Ticket to Work. (my hours were cut by one hour a day for reasons I‚Äôm unsure of although I later discovered that if that didn‚Äôt happen I may soon have risked being ineligible for SSI which would have put me in big trouble since they were paying for Risperdal which was expensive at the time.) For part of that time I walked from my Mother‚Äôs house to the bus stop about a half mile away which often caused my shoes to make funny noises due to the rain that often fell. We moved soon afterwards to where my Mom had to drive me to the bus-stop. While working I did shelving, put metallic strips in books which helped with theft, reading the shelves to keep the books in order, finding books for people (I loved to find books for kids because they actually appreciated it. Adults didn‚Äôt), and counting the racial demograp
hics every month of the new applicants for Library cards. I also periodically did research projects on the local newspaper fiche including one that was made into a book in the research Library. I then worked as a VISTA volunteer from November 2007 through the end of 2010. I put old files in order and scanned them to a computer and then renamed them. I also put a computer program together by doing the tedious work of putting one file inside of another over and over again that could have data put on it. I also did a lot of odd jobs from putting pumpkins on a truck, to washing pans which was difficult due to the plantar fascitis which had developed in my feet. (I leaned against the sink because I had difficulty standing in place for long periods of time. That problem is worse now.) I then went back to school and earned a history degree at the associate‚Äôs level. I took one class at a time and made straight A‚Äôs. Unfortunately my father‚Äôs death, my niece leaving home, the stress of moving to my first apartmen
t, and a new drug which had bad side effects destabilized me and I went to the Psych Ward one month after completing the degree. I went to the Psych Ward 3 more times in a half-year and never completely recovered. I worked as a volunteer because at the time you couldn‚Äôt even work for pay on SSI. Later the Ticket to Work came in but as I found out later it‚Äôs purpose was to lose my Medicaid which was still paying for expensive medicine which I discovered was the drugs that worked the best for me. I started work for pay when my parents divorced and partially supported my Mom during that time. She had a serious surgery during the VISTA time and an even more serious one during my time in college and I moved out of fear of being stuck in the suburbs and being unable to pay the bills of living in the house with her dead or unable to take care of herself. My brother admitted to me he couldn‚Äôt take care of my needs as well. The apartment was miles from most employment and transportation was a public one in a cit
y full of cars. I can‚Äôt drive due to an eye condition. I wrote this for fun because I enjoyed my working years to a great extent. I weigh 338 pounds now and have trouble getting around these days.

It was horrible One thing to note about jail in Fairfax County, VA‚Ä¶ Lunch is two flavorless bologne sandwiches and a tasty cookie, dinner was tasteless slop, noodles, spinach, or bread with butter, but breakfast was incredible! I got a hot potato sliced in four, delicious pancakes with sugary syrup, a hardboiled egg (I got a taste for them when I was inside, I still like them now), and a one-serving container of cereal. I also got a small carton of milk. For my first two months they gave me cinnamon toast crunch, which was awesome, but for the last three months I got gluten-free rice chex, which tasted like nothing. Breakfast was basically like paradise to me. As far as the sandwiches at lunch, I wolfed down the first one and ate the second super slo

When I didn‚Äôt have a breakfast carton of milk, I drank from the water fountain by the toilet, and the water was very cold and crisp, very tasty. Also, most inmates in solitary get an hour a day where they are let out of their cell. I never got that. Jail was my mom‚Äôs last resort to keep me safe off the streets, but it kind of backfired. Worst of all they confiscated my underwear and never gave me my medicine. I wasn‚Äôt provided magazines until my last week in jail. I wish I had been offered them earlier, they really help keep you sane. There was a segment on tourism in Paris and I tried to meditate and pretend I was there."

We present a study of the effects of active vs. sham tDCS on cognition and symptoms in a sample of 45 Chinese patients with schizophrenia who showed significant cognitive deficits and were treated for 10 sessions with active or sham tDCS. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by PANSS scores, and cognitive symptoms assessed by MATRICS battery and other tests. There were no differences between cognitive or symptom scores between subjects treated with active vs. sham tDCS tested within 1-2 days after the end of the 10th session. H
owever, two weeks later subjects treated with active tDCS showed significantly more improvements on MATRICS Speed of Processing domain. MATRICS Overall Composite and a CogState measure related to accuracy on a 1-back working memory task were improved at two weeks in statistical tests without multiple corrections. The improvement in cognitive test scores 2 weeks after the last tDCS session, suggests longer term effects may be related to changes in neuroplasticity induced by 10 sessions of tDCS. The lack of significant changes in cognition shortly after the completion of 10 tDCS sessions contrasts with our earlier positive findings in U.S. patients with schizophrenia."

Now after coming off adderall I heard a voice saying ‚Äúsee you in 11 years‚Äù where they will take me to North Korea and give me plastic surgery to become the dictator‚Äìone of many, they apparently do this to many people around the world. I feel like in the past my psychologist in the hospital was checking for insight and I deliberately pretended not to have any because I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. Also, my boyfriend tells me for sure I do not have mental illness. Not even borderline. And I feel like he is in charge of powerful things. I feel alone because I feel like not a lot of people know the devil and so don‚Äôt have these problems. I guess 
I don‚Äôt know what to do but post things. If anyone has any advice. I‚Äôm taking medication but it doesn‚Äôt really help. When I hear voices they are quiet and sound technological. They are not external. I just feel so alone. I also had visions of hell and heard Jewish children say that I‚Äôm going to hell. I realized that one of visions had to be false but I‚Äôm worried about the others. Since one of them I realized were false, I feel a little bit better."
176092463,About a month. But only barely. It really only started working a few weeks after we upped the dose.
176092464,Everyone doesn‚Äôt hate you. Do certain people make you feel like this? If you genuinely think that everyone hates you then that could be mild paranoia in my non professional opinion.
176092465,I have something similar happen almost everyday. The voices either talk amongst themselves about me like im in a coma or like i got hurt or od‚Äôd and i have a concussion and im out on my feet and their just laughing and making fun of me. Their laughing right now. These voices i suspect like yours are malignant and have a job to do. I make their job hard to do when i can so they dont win.

176092473,Thanks for the info _AT_MENTION_ but the medical literature claims that Abilify is just as effective as Risperdal but yeah I have my doubts.
176092474,You shouldn‚Äôt discount data and evidence. Of course everyone should try and achieve their dreams but blind optimism isnt rational. Theres no shame in lowering your aim to something more achievable. Theres no shame in recognising you can‚Äôt do something provided you made effort to explore the opportunity.

Picking up supplements that are supposed to help me sleep. The longer I go without sleep the worse the paranoia about going to sleep gets. It‚Äôs vicious. I hope I can sleep.

176092492,I do well to a certain level. If it‚Äôs more than usual then I get stressed. I get too stressed I get paranoid. That usually goes pear shaped pretty quickly after that. So I‚Äôm pretty resilient but I don‚Äôt work full time or for money simply because of this‚Ä¶

176092494,"Ay, sorry man. During my last eating group, the facilitator proceeded to talk about some of her spiritual beliefs. She read a quote from a new age book. The quote was was brief, but it hit me. Luckily, the session was done virtually so I just logged out. I think any type of spirituality can be triggering for SZ."

176092496,"Yep, I‚Äôm 27 and live with my parents. I‚Äôd be homeless without them I haven‚Äôt always lived with them, though. I went off to college for a few years, and then lived on my own for a few years after that till I had a psychotic break"
176092497,I stutter and have trouble getting my words out too.
176092498,"Yes, your right. It will take a lot to convince me it wasn‚Äôt real. So many ‚Äòcoincidences‚Äô. The fact that my meds are working is a big flag for me but even still I question this like ‚Äòthey‚Äô are doing it to play a trick on me"

174365532,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_, im going to talk to my nurse monday, she might increase abilify slightly And im pretty much out of the psychosis after olanzapine, now just in a dream like state of mind."
176092502,I read this book
174365527,"I find Ziprasidone quite good. I also take 40 mg twice daily. However, i found that it wasn‚Äôt strong enough for me (i had been on 80 mg twice daily but it didn‚Äôt really provide much relief) so they added some Clozapine to the mix and i‚Äôve been pretty good since. It is relatively weight neutral, so that is also an added bonus of taking it."
176092503,Does this cause her lots of pain?
176092504,In my opinion memory loss can be emotional and stress related. When you relax it is easier to think back without any problems.
176092505,"Yes, that‚Äôs correct. I should mention both"
174365537,"Its weird, every 3 to 6 months ill have this exestiental epiphany that i infact have schizophrenia and the ‚Äúworld‚Äù i live in isnt the same as everyone else. It‚Äôs heart breaking since you see soo much time go by as u literally struggle just to exisist."

176092507,Not sure if this is the case here (I haven‚Äôt decided yet) but I hate it when folk come here to research what to say to doctors. I feel manipulated and exploited. I had previously avoided these threads and I think I will avoid this one too
176092508,"Hi _PERSON_ read your posts and its seems like you mentioned you struggle to mantain focused on one topic, I think reading five pages of the same book everyday will help you. Might I also suggest books on goal settings as your next read as it might help to set yourself goals like getting a girlfriend and job and then break them down into tasks that you need to do to achieve those goals. Mind you getting a job is more important than a girlfriend as generally the one goes with the other. We still live in a world where woman want a provider unfortunately. I can relate with the low motivation I felt that way after relapses but fortunately for me my motivation would eventually return."
176092509,When I tried lowering my olanzapine my emotions came back but after a while they turned bad.
176092510,"Honestly, I rather be in a state hospital than a private one. There‚Äôs more regulation and oversight I think. I‚Äôve been to a public one before and it smelled like barf and ???? and there were no beds. It was hard to sleep and I hated and feared going to the bathroom. But I think private is worse. People know I have ‚Äúdelusions‚Äù that I was tortured and killed in a private mental hospital. It all stopped once I started going to a public doctor. They are better than private and are actually more intelligent and have more education. The problem is funding and overpopulation. The only thing good about that private hospital is they fired all the staff like 3-4 times and now they got people who care and are empathetic and are highly intelligent and educated. I believe I was in MKUltra, Monarch, and Montauk but noone believes me, which is probably a good thing. I was a super soldier, time traveler, and other things. Even had severe issues with extraterrestrials, which no one really accepts or believe
s. I was tortured and killed by extraterrestrials. Like I said, it stopped when I started believing in Jesus‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been to DUMBs like _NAME_/Area 51 so they could have made a fake look-a-like hospital but I don‚Äôt know. I get memories through dreams and through my visions/psychosis. It happened thousands of times. It‚Äôs like my consciousness is being transferred into a cloned body while I sleep. The best thing one can do is get outside help. The crazy _NAME_ and visions were extremely traumatic, so disturbing to me that I would rather die than live through it again. Things started to change once I accepted God into my heart. My mom is a big influence on me. She loves me and I love her. She keeps me on track and helps me and encourages me. If it wasn‚Äôt for her, I would probably be homeless or worse. It takes a lot of balls to say this, but I think my mom is my ‚Äúhandler‚Äù in a way‚Ä¶a good, positive one. I don‚Äôt think she even knows, but I have memories of this. She keeps me on the straight and rig
ht path. I‚Äôve read other people‚Äôs stories online and have heard similar stories."

176092513,Yes. Mine are exactly the same way. They feel that I should be able to lift myself up so easily and get a job and move out. It‚Äôs not that easy. I have been like this for 8 years now. In and out of jobs. One mental break down after the next. I have been stable for almost 3 years now but I still struggle with bouts of paranoia and attacks on my mind. There is more to it than meets the eye.

176092518,I started smoking when I was 13 and I got schiz when I was 19. I believe it played a role in me getting schiz. I know a lot of people that smoke. After 20 years of observing pot smokers I do see traits of schiz in people that smoke regularly. Alot of pot smokers do have hallucinations if they get really high. I also know they experience delusions.

To make up for this I collapse during the day and end up sleeping all day which probably is creating a negative cycle. I cannot stop obsessing over the demons and the devil. My head is constantly barraged with thoughts about them, mostly constant worrying about when they are going to attack me next and what happens if I give in, and it leaves me in this constant state of feeling sick to my stomach with dread. summary: don‚Äôt have a job, sleep is completely messed up, even little things are incredibly chall

176092560,I have the same problem when I‚Äôm out of meds. I assure you that you‚Äôre real. This is proof you need the meds. The sza fools you to thinking you might not need meds. I think the best thing is to take them and talk to your pdoc about your experiences.

Time to rehospitalization by treatment group (GOT + IOT; GOT alone) was evaluated with _PERSON_ survival analysis. The impact of demographics and clinical factors associated with rehospitalization were investigated using _PERSON_ proportional hazards models.Of the 111 patients who met the criteria, 54 were in GOT + IOT and 57 in GOT alone groups. Over the two years from discharge, the 
overall rehospitalization rate was 51.376% (56 patients), 16 of whom received GOT + IOT demonstrated a significantly lower rehospitalization rate compared to 40 of whom received GOT alone. Time to rehospitalization was significantly longer for GOT + IOT group compared to those in GOT alone (p < 0.001). The multivariate _PERSON_ proportional hazards models showed that type of OT (HR = 0.543), medication adherence (HR = 0.343), access to resident support persons (HR = 0.450), and executive function at discharge (HR = 0.740) were all significantly associated with rehospitalization.Our results provide support for the prolonging effects of IOT in relation to rehospitalization and the reduction of rehospitalization risk compared to patients with schizophrenia who receive GOT alone, in addition to supporting good cognition at discharge and favorable medication adherence.

174365559,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Socioeconomic deprivation and blood lipids in first-episode psychosis patients with minimal antipsychotic exposure: Implications for cardiovascular risk. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and A _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , Dec 30 2019 The influence of socioeconomic deprivation on the cardiovascular health of patients with psychosis-spectrum disorders (PSD) has not been investigated despite the growing recognition of social factors as determinants of health, and the disproportionate rates of cardiovascular mortality observed in PSD. Discordant results have been documented when studying dyslipidemia -a core cardiovascular risk factor- in first-episode psychosis (FEP), before chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications. The objective of the present study is to determine the extent to which socioeconomic deprivation affects blood lipids in patients with FEP, and examine its implications for cardiovascular risk in PSD.Linear regression models, controlling for age, sex, ex
posure to pharmacotherapy, and physical anergia, were used to test the association between area-based measures of material and social deprivation and blood lipid levels in a sample of FEP patients (n = 208).Social, but not material deprivation, was associated with lower levels of total and HDL cholesterol. This effect was statistically significant in patients with affective psychoses, but not in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.Contrary to other reports from the literature, the relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and blood lipid levels was contingent on the social rather than the material aspects of deprivation. Furthermore, this association also depended on the main diagnostic category of psychosis, suggesting a complex interaction between the environment, psychopathology, and physical health. Future studies exploring health issues in psychosis might benefit from taking these associations into consideration. A better understanding of the biology of blood lipids in this context is necessary."

174365555,"I find this encouraging. http://www.neuronatherapeutics.com/technology/ The central nervous system (CNS) contains both excitatory cells (primarily neurons that express glutamate) and inhibitory cells (primarily neurons that express GABA). Normal brain and spinal cord function depends on a delicate balance between these two types of neurons. This balance is normally established during embryonic development and just after birth when the nervous system is still assembling and developing neurologic connections. During this time, neurons are born, migrate to proper locations, and form connections or synapses, creating complex circuits that are maintained into adulthood. Problems arise when genetic mutations and/or external traumas result in aberrant development and/or degeneration of particular CNS cell types, leading to the dysregulation of neural circuits. Epileptic seizures, neuropathic pain, spasticity, and certain types of cognitive impairments and psychoses can be symptomatic of dysregulated neura
l activity. Because the _NAME_ of new neurons and synapses, or plasticity, is limited in the adult CNS, these diseases persist and lack effective treatment. Notably, effective drugs are lacking for many patients with neuropathic pain, and one-third of epilepsy patients do not respond to current anti-epileptic drugs. Neurona‚Äôs founders have discovered that transplantation of specialized neurons in the adult CNS can rebalance neural activity and induce plasticity to repair neural circuits. Neurona is using human stem cell technologies to develop novel cell-based therapeutics. They‚Äôre starting with epilepsy, but it doesn‚Äôt seem they will stop there.

174365569,"My therapist has a problem with differences amongst schizos. When I say her that in my protected work enterprise, there is a hierarchy between sz workers because they don‚Äôt have the same level of disability/abilities and cognitive functioning. Her answer is that we all are ills so there is no difference. I disagree with her. Some can manage money budget, driving a car or truck, difficult tasks or travel abroad, etc‚Ä¶ When others can‚Äôt. My pdoc told me we find the same differences in general population of normies, and that they are not specific to schizophrenia. Maybe he is right but disability and loss of capacities is higher for szs. What do you think about that??"

176092701,"The highway to get to the beach goes through the (Santa _NAME_) mountains. It‚Äôs a constantly winding, curving road, the lanes are narrow, and there‚Äôs a lot of semi trucks with full loads on it usually. When you‚Äôre going downhill at 40 miles per hour on a curvy part of road and there‚Äôs a massive, long truck right next to you about 6 or 7 feet away it can be unnerving. It was about a 40 minute drive on it to get to the beach. It was Highway 17 and starting when I was in 5th or 6th grade when my dad would drive us to the beach or my friends mom, and all through high school I was on that road a million times. When my friend got his license at age 16 we were constantly going to the beach. When we first started going on it was different. Later as we got older they made it safer but when we were young and my friends first started driving it was a dangerous drive. There was no barriers between the oncoming traffic and the lanes going both ways. So you would be driving these huge curves in the mount
ains at 50+ mph and oncoming traffic would be whizzing by just a few yards away. There were a lot of car accidents on it and a lot of people actually got killed on it. So it was quite scary and hard to relax when you were driving it or a passenger. I didn‚Äôt drive it myself until I was out of high school and I got my first car but by that time they had put short safety walls to separate the oncoming opposite traffic. The first time was quite scary though and nerve wracking but then after awhile I got used to it. I even made the drive on LSD, at night, a couple of times. I don‚Äôt know how I did that, it was interesting. But then after I got sick I rarely drove there. I remember a few times in my twenties, but not a lot. The last time when I was in my thirties took all my nerve and concentration and I had to master my fear. I‚Äôm 58 now but just about ten years ago I was thinking of driving to the beach but then I just lost my nerve and I thought I couldn‚Äôt do it. Just thinking of driving those curves made 
be too nervous and downright scared. I hated to admit it and it was a big blow to my ego that I was scared to drive it. But the thing is, that is the only road I‚Äôm afraid to drive on. I‚Äôll drive two or three hours to Sacramento by myself through hills and long stretches‚Äô of straight roads or I‚Äôll drive the hills of San _NAME_ or I‚Äôll drive the congested bumper to bumper traffic on Highway 101 anywhere but I won‚Äôt go to the beach anymore on 17. But there was an incident just about 5 or 6 years ago when I was driving in my home town and I took the wrong exit to the freeway and I found myself on that Highway! The other feature I didn‚Äôt mention on that highway is that it goes long stretches with no exits. So when I found myself on it I knew I would have to go quite a ways on it before I could turn around and drive back, I had no choice. Did I mention it was night and it was a car I had just bought that I wasn‚Äôt used to driving? As soon as I got on it I knew it was going to be bad. There was no tim
e for fear or worry or any distraction. I mean it was no joke, I knew I could get in a bad accident and get hurt badly or possibly killed. I just forgot about everything but driving. I didn‚Äôt look at other cars, I didn‚Äôt play the radio, I didn‚Äôt look anywhere but at the road. It was just nerve wracking. Well, the epilogue is that I had to drive about 7 miles before I could turn around. Obviously I‚Äôm still alive so I survived but I can‚Äôt believe I did it. I never had an experience like that as an adult. If I ever made that same mistake I really have doubts I could handle it. It was just a fluke mistake, a freak accident that I got on that freeway. It wasn‚Äôt fun or adventurous at the time, it was just bad. But it‚Äôs something to remember."

176092703,I went through pregnancy with schizophrenia. The baby was planned and is the best and most loving being ever. I can sit next to her and feel the love from her.

I am in much better health than I thought possible and my daughter is now three.

176092704,"I think you‚Äôre onto something there about helping people. I really can honestly say i dont like 90%+ of people, so an activity that i can fo by myself would be ideal for me. However my pdoc said im too self absorbed and that i should focus on others not myself. Starting to think theres something to that‚Ä¶i would actually love to do something to help the homeless people in my town. I think the amount of good one can do has no limits in that area. I dont help them now even in simple ways because if social intelligence had a rating similar to IQ, my social intelligence would be -9001. So i feel like id get slaughtered if they tried to talk to me or better yet take advantage of me because i am quite the sucker."

I feel like giving up often but despite my best efforts to throw in the towel and say, ‚ÄúScrew this, I give up‚Äù, Life always has a way of surprising me and I get that glimpse into humanity and realize, ""Hey, Life is manageable, it‚Äôs not as hard as I make it, ""and I just keep going.

176092793,Myo inositol seem to bring emotions but might affect short term memory. It reduces fear so need to be careful about your behavior and actions after taking it. The way how it works is like this. It reduces your ability to think deep so even fearful thoughts appear less fearful. Due to this less intensity processing short term memory get effected as information is not registered properly. Like other drugs tolerance build up quickly so take only occasionally and that too with smallest doses like 1 or 2g.

Neuropsychologists will do the old standard IQ tests like the WAIS, but only look at the relationship between scores within each subdomain. They will determine if a patient has cognitive decline based on if there are significant differences between scores on different domains. For instance attention may be poor but episodic memory good. They measure things like spatial memory, verbal memory, task switching, verbal reasoning etc. Then they factor in your educational attainment to see if there has been any cognitive decline."

OC and OT involved one 90-min group session per week. OC consisted of structured exercise programs and OT addressed daily living skills. Primary outcome measurements were mental health variables, such as Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, _PERSON_ Depression Inventory, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Global Assessment of Fun
ctioning and executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST). Secondary measures were the adherence and PA. PA was measured by responding to the Physical Activity Scale (K-PASE) and wearing a pedometer for 2 days.Repeated measures ANOVA revealed improved psychotic symptoms (p?=?.014), depression (p?=?.007), state (p?=?.031) and trait anxiety (p?=?.002) and global functions (p?=?.024) in the OC group compared with OT group. The OC group showed increased correct rates (p?=?.022) and categories completed (p?=?.033) in the WCST. There was no difference in total K-PASE score between groups; however, there was a significant improvement in the number of daily steps in the OC group compared with the OT group (p?=?.030).OC significantly improved mental health and executive function in individuals with schizophrenia. Further, OC significantly increased PA measured by the pedometers. These findings suggest that OC offers a safe and attrition-lowering intervention promoting mental health and PA.cris.nih.go.kr iden

176092951,"There is brain damage. It is shown in humans too. It is there very soon after starting. Which is why it is so incredibly stupid psychiatrists rely on pills only and arent more careful about prescribing them. I see that as a huge mistake. On the other hand, stressing about it doesnt help much either. If you need meds, you need meds. Also, i think they dont really know yet what the damages mean.

My situation is the inverse of yours. I was relatively sane for most of my life. I _NAME_ my self identity and self-esteem from my brain power, as someone with a genius-level IQ who works in a cognitively challenging career. Mental illness not only ruined my life and reputation, it took away my identity. I‚Äôm also an artist and I haven‚Äôt found a way to return to my art since the onset of my symptoms.

I will also be trying to come off Diazepam again, as it was not successful before as I went to quickly. Procyclidine I am taking 10mg instead of the 20mg I am supposed to. I cannot cut this out until Amisulpride is lower as I get jerking movements throughout my body. I reckon this is going to take about 6 months to get rid of all these pills and hit the reset button."

Eventually I fell asleep one night in my apartment. When I woke up he was on top of me undressing me. I couldn‚Äôt move. I froze up. I got pregnant that day.

174365666,"ScienceDaily Flickering light mobilizes brain chemistry that may fight Alzheimer's The promise of flickering light to treat Alzheimer's takes another step forward in this new study, which reveals stark biochemical mechanisms: 40 Hertz stimulus triggers a marked release of signaling chemicals. Though conducted on healthy mice, this new study is directly connected to human trials, in which Alzheimer‚Äôs patients are exposed to 40 Hz light and sound. Insights gained in mice at the _NAME_ Institute of Technology are informing the human trials in collaboration with _NAME_ University. The 40 Hz frequency stems from the observation that brains of Alzheimer‚Äôs patients suffer early on from a lack of what is called gamma, moments of gentle, constant brain waves acting like a dance beat for neuron activity. Its most common frequency is right around 40 Hz, and exposing mice to light flickering at that frequency restored gamma and also appears to have prevented heavy Alzheimer‚Äôs brain damage. In the current 
study, the surging cytokines hinted at a connection with microglial activity, and in particular, the cytokine Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF). The researchers will look for a causal connection to microglia activation in an upcoming study, but the overall surge of cytokines was a good sign in general, they said. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of cytokines went up, some anti-inflammatory and some inflammatory, and it was a transient response,‚Äù Wood said. ‚ÄúOften, a transient inflammatory response can promote pathogen clearance; it can promote repair.‚Äù The 40 Hz stimulation did not need long to trigger the cytokine surge. ‚ÄúWe found an increase in cytokines after an hour of stimulation,‚Äù _PERSON_ said. ‚ÄúWe saw phosphoprotein signals after about 15 minutes of flickering.‚Äù As controls, the researchers applied three additional light stimuli, and to their astonishment, all three had some effect on cytokines. But stimulating with 20 Hz stole the show. ‚ÄúAt 20 Hz, cytokine levels were way down. That co
uld be useful, too. There may be circumstances where you want to suppress cytokines,‚Äù Singer said. ""We‚Äôre thinking different kinds of stimulation could potentially become a platform of tools in a variety of contexts like Parkinson‚Äôs or schizophrenia. Many neurological disorders are associated with immune response."" The research team warns against people improvising light therapies on their own, since more data is needed to thoroughly establish effects on humans, and getting frequencies wrong could possibly even do damage."

Hallucination says ‚Äúunderstood Thoughts‚Äù and does not say ‚Äúphysical words‚Äù that are heard with the ear !! The vocal thoughts of the hallucination entity are much clearer than the implicit thoughts (soundless) that produced by the human mind-brain . The clarity of the audible sound of the hallucination is reaches a grade of 99,99% and there is no noise of any intensity that prevents this clarity at all !

174365713,"Consider this delusion: In every split of a second, the world breaks into an infinity of paralele universes where every other possibility that can happen in that split of a second does happen. For example, there is a slight possibility for a brick to fall into my head or for an earthquake to happen while writing this message. In one of those infinity of parallele universes, it did happen a split second ago. It did happen it every split second that passed in the minutes required for me to write this message. Now this seems like a highly bizzare delusion, and it deffinitely is. A Nobel prize laureate said it‚Äôs probably the most crazy idea ever thought in science. You wouldn‚Äôt expect a non-psychotic person to believe such an idea without a ton of evidence. Yet, 25% of scientist from the field of physics believe in it, the other 75% believe the other main theory. _NAME_ was in the 25% who believed in this bizzare delusion. The theory itself has zero proof, but neither is it refuted. It‚Äôs similar 
to the idea that a spagette monster created the world, you can‚Äôt prove or disprove it. So why do they believe in it? Because it‚Äôs a delusion of support, it supports a bigger theory. In 1930, materialism has been refuted by discoveries in physics. ‚ÄúEverything comes from matter‚Äù was proven to be an extremist point of view, similar to the ‚Äúevery mental health problem comes from child sexual molestation‚Äù popular during the Freudian period of psychiatry. Yet, materialism was quite a powerful world-view, many scientist found it hard to change their religion from materialism to agnosticism. The many-worlds theory described above is basically a mathematical trick, a support-delusion for materialism. It‚Äôs similar to how the ‚Äúworld was made in 6 days‚Äù idea looks strange taken out of context. A random person from a non-christian country would never believe in such an idea. And yet, 35%+ of the population in certain western countries believe in it today. Delusions of support can be very powerful."

what a system is. And like the way she talks about her experiences it sounds so fake. But like I say I dont want to judge. I‚Äôm mainly just venting but I hate this.

The severity of suicidal ideation was associated with higher levels of depression, paranoia, hallucinations, anger, insomnia, negative beliefs about the self and others, pessimism, worry, and delusion safety-seeking behaviours and lower levels of psychological well-being and reward responsiveness. Severity of ideation was not associated with cannabis or alcohol use, working memory, pain, or meaningful activity levels.Patients with persecutory delusions are typically in a severe state of psychological stress, and at risk of suicide, as indicated by very high levels of suicidal ideation.

176093281,It sounds a worthwhile thing that may help you. With covid do they do zoom or other such meeting? Might be worth investigating whether there is a cheaper way to access these services.

176093282,As long as your doctor approved of you coming off meds then it‚Äôs fine. But if your doctor did not ok it and he‚Äôs not monitoring you then you are risking a lot.

I‚Äôm desperate because I cannot get off this medication (Abilify) and the feeling is just unbearable. Thanks in advance guys."
174365736,"With me it started with intense anxiety and social withdrawal. I used to think that there was something very odd about the way I was sitting in class, and I thought the other students were thinking I needed to go to a mental hospital, which would have been a big humiliation to me at the time. I‚Äôve overcome that feeling, though. I‚Äôve been hospitalized around twenty times, and I don‚Äôt feel embarrassed about it. I thought for a long time that my problem was anxiety and depression. Other people kept telling me I was mentally ill. Now I‚Äôm in an assisted living center for the mentally ill. If you can beat this on your own that‚Äôs good, but don‚Äôt be ashamed to reach out for help if you need it."
176093293,Welcome to the forum Hope you will feel better soon and that you will be able to feel more independent soon such as handling money etc Hope you take your medication. It can do wonders. If it doesn‚Äôt help maybe you need a medication change. I don‚Äôt have friends either. As such. Not to hang out with etc but I volunteer work and love the people I volunteer work with. Maybe volunteer work would do you good. You can find ways of dealing with that anger so you don‚Äôt treat people badly.

She may even have a seemingly random burst of energy, during which she seems to return to her old self. But if your mom‚Äôs in hospice, then it‚Äôs over. There won‚Äôt be any miracles, and she won‚Äôt return to you; this is the end, and the more of that hope you hold on to now, the harder it‚Äôll crush you when you face the inevitable.

I‚Äôm afraid to switch to anything else because the one time I switched to another med (Abilify) such a horrific side effect happened and I feel like these next six years are going to be depressing and I need real help to cope with it but the only answer I‚Äôll get from the psychiatrist is you‚Äôre doing fine or we‚Äôll switch meds which I‚Äôm too afraid to do
176093399,"No, I was skinny."
174365763,NThanks for posting this thread. Right now I kinda feel fine on risperdal. The only thing is my negative symptoms and positive symptoms flares up when I stay to long in my home. Maybe I should try something else
176093400,I hope I don‚Äôt come across as being an ??????? about the helpline. I just find it harder to deal with the newly trained people who are following a training manual rather than the relationships built over time with certain practitioners who are on that line who work for the local mental health trust.
176093401,I can‚Äôt talk about current delusions because I still believe them and don‚Äôt know they are delusions. I can talk about past delusions which lasted as long as years and decades.
176093402,Who is _NAME_?..
176093403,"Woooo boy, time to dig deep into those memories. Here‚Äôs what I can come up with off the top of my head, having been in both children‚Äôs and adult units. Adolescence: Everything had a rigid structure and schedule. After morning meds, vitals, breakfast, and hygiene time, was school until 2 or 3. We‚Äôd then go back to the unit, and have a form of therapy, which differed based on the day. Some days it was group therapy, some days it was art, some days it was music, and some was outdoors teambuilding exercises. We had a TV and a radio we could use as long as there were no huge blowups over it - in which case, nobody got to enjoy it. Dinner was followed by unstructured time such as playing cards with the staff, chess, or rec yard activity. Food was universally decent at worst. If someone acted out on the unit, we‚Äôd all be sent to our rooms while the upset individual was handled. We‚Äôd then come back out. Some units had both males and females, and some were totally segregated. Adult: Again, the sam
e rituals of meds, vitals and breakfast. Obviously, there was no school. Lots of free time spaced apart around random forms of therapy. Not much diversity in day-to-day routines. Got boring as frick quickly. Now there‚Äôs a hurry to stabilize someone in 3-5 short days and street them. A lot of these folks are frequent flyers to the psych unit. In for 5 days, out for a day or 5, and right back in. A lot of this is a combination of the stingy insurance coverages, and a need for beds. I‚Äôm sorry, but there‚Äôs no way you can reasonably stabilize an adult in 3-5 days, just jerking around meds that any outside pdoc can. It‚Äôs actually a real shame. I think stays need to return to the 2-4 week time span. Hope this helped."
176093404,Yeah maybe. Thing is I‚Äôm on a very low dose. 300ml abilify injection every month. So I dont think it‚Äôs that I mean it could be but idk
174365765,Schizophrenic experiences are not objective (a more accurate portrayal than saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot real‚Äù) because they‚Äôre not experiences that the vast majority can relate to. There‚Äôs no corroborable proof to what‚Äôs happening to you. No defined science to it.

176093410,I‚Äôve been two years with mine haven‚Äôt had a psychiatrist really before that as was getting my treatment in government. I was wondering if people keep the same psychiatrist for many years or if people change every now and then. I like the psychiatrist I got allows me to choose a treatment plan and meds after explaining things and potential risks. He‚Äôs also good at stabilising me if I relapse.

Has anyone recovered from this? I realize this might be too sensitive so I understand if no one will want to say anything.

Can you understand the point I was trying to make? The now retired pdoc used to let me smoke without giving me much grief.

176093532,I was depressed from as far back as I can remember. I was paranoid since first grade.
176093533,Not trying to. I just hope you cut back on the alcohol.
176093534,I quit over ten years ago. maybe around twelve years ago or so. I quit when I was living in Sweden and i had had voices for years but it was getting better . I went from smoking a big packet to a little packet. I still think cigarettes smell good. My x boyfriend smokes and smoked inside while we were living together. I liked the smell but it was bad for me too. I went from owing a packet of smokes every pay and not affording milk to being able to afford milk and save up for my plane ticket to Australia all by myself. Now I can afford agistment for my sacred neigh. I could never afford it if I was still a smoker. I read somewhere about putting a golden coin in a pot every smoke free day and every day you have smoked you put the butt and water in a pot beside it and ask which pot you want. I think it takes determination and endurance. Good wishes to you.

176093537,I was high from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep for 4 years. I didn‚Äôt know what reality was. I just kept going further and further down the rabbit hole until I ended up with a severe psychosis for a year. They gave me an injection of haldol in the hospital that brought me out of it. I was so far gone the doctors told my mom I‚Äôd have to be institutionalized. My prognoses was very poor. I came out of the psychosis and started newer meds. I had a lot of demons from my past and I had to work it out for myself. It‚Äôs been 23 years since my last psychosis. I was able to work out the problems I had in my head. I came to peace with my past and moved on. I have a pretty good grip on reality now. It wasn‚Äôt easy getting to where I‚Äôm at.

176093558,I was drinking alcoholically for the better parts of 2011 to 2015 especially those years. I tried quitting many times. I‚Äôm also one to dabble with illicit (for me) drugs. So I tried kratom and Vicodin. I did like an opioid like Vicodin and the feeling of kratom too. Then in December 2015 my doc mentioned naltrexone I said I‚Äôd try it. It relieved me of cravings to alcohol and opioids for the most part from then forward. It also helps with some of my other mental health issues. I took shrooms in 2014 mixed with abilify and caffeine and alcohol and it messed me up real bad. But the naltrexone helped to heal me a bit from this bad experience. As well as other meds but I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be without this med. it‚Äôs a bit triggering to me there‚Äôs a drug that feels as good as anything that doesn‚Äôt cause mania at this point I like being down more then up. It used to be vice versa. But I have to stay on my naltrexone or else i would become very uncomfortable mentally and also slip back into a
ddiction. The point is That you can‚Äôt take opium derivatives on naltrexone a med I rely on. I‚Äôve seen many a struggle down the path to chasing an opiate/opioid high. If you‚Äôre over the withdrawal you don‚Äôt need detox. You can try NA/AA meetings. I enjoyed going when I was first trying to get sober.

I could increase my social skills too and be self-sufficient on the streets, ideally. But that‚Äôs probably an insult to others because it‚Äôs pretty rough out there. I probably would stay where I‚Äôm from because I‚Äôm largely familiar with things. I worry what will happen to me after my parents die. I have no real family or friends left. My sister never calls me. I guess I have my brother, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to bother him with money. I rather just expire if it comes to it.

I also sometimes believe I live in a simulation, but that‚Äôs 100% due to my derealization. It‚Äôs not 100% cured and probably will never be, but things mostly look real the majority of times now. I still have my moments. I just hope I don‚Äôt come back schizophrenia again lol. I often feel this isn‚Äôt my first life at all. It‚Äôs been several so far. I‚Äôve lost count. The hardest thing was being a Libertarian and then going on disability. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I am now okay. But I hate relying on people for money and support. I never grew up. I cannot really rely on my father. He‚Äôs probably a narcissist. I think he might leave me some money someday, but there‚Äôs no guarantee in life."

174365815,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Penfluridol, a Unique Psychiatric Medicine for the Treatment of Chronic Schizophrenia. E Zur, International journal of pharmaceutical compounding , Mar-Apr 2019 Schizophrenia is a serious, disabling, enduring, and relapsing mental illness which causes problems with the ability to think, feel, and perceive things clearly. One cause of relapse and readmission to a hospital is poor compliance with antipsychotic medication, often due to its adverse effects. Schizophrenia may also affect a person's insight, interfering with their ability to appreciate the benefit of taking medication long term. The relapse rate is significantly higher in those who have discontinued antipsychotic medication. Penfluridol is an unusual, potent, long-acting, first-generation, oral antipsychotic agent indicated for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia, acute psychosis, and Tourette syndrome. It may be considered a depot medication, as it is administered once a week. Despite this positive analysis, and the 
unique added value of this medication to psychotic, non-compliant patients, Janssen-Cilag, the sole manufacturer of penfluridol worldwide, decided to stop production in 2009. This decision forced many psychotic patients worldwide to abandon the once-a-week convenient treatment and to replace it with a daily, oral treatment or a depot injection. Because penfluridol is no longer commercially available, it has created an opportunity for compounding pharmacists worldwide to accept this challenge and offer this medication to psychiatrists because of its clinical therapeutics. For the past 5 years, penfluridol has been available to compounding pharmacists in Israel and has received favorable feedback from physicians and patients."

174365810,"When I first started coming to the old forums I started off slow and only posted occasionally. I had accidentally stumbled upon the old forums in 2009; I was researching schizophrenia and got led to the site. I had never been in a chat room or a message board and wasn‚Äôt quite sure what I had found. But I remember reading a post about where someone had questions about working. I figured that was right up my alley and I replied and whoever it was thanked me and said I helped. I used to have a friend in the '80‚Äôs who also had paranoid schizophrenia and we went to the same vocational program for awhile and we actually lived in a few of the same houses a mental health agency put us in with other people. IDK if this is just a term used for high school girls but we were ‚Äúfrenemies‚Äù. We started off as friends but then we had several ‚Äúincidents‚Äù where we did some very unfriendly things. For instance, I got addicted to crack around the first time I met him and I remember once when I was broke and 
I didn‚Äôt have any food because I spent all my money on crack, he lent me his ATM card and gave me the pin number to his bank account and told me I could withdraw $75 for food and then come right back. Well, I withdrew $200 instead and met a hooker and got involved with her and her boyfriend and heroin and cocaine and didn‚Äôt come back for three days. In my defense, who gives their debit card and pin number to a crack addict? When I finally came back to our house he was enraged (he had a really bad temper) and he told me he had called police departments in three cities and they were keeping an eye out for me. He also told me he had waited for me to come home and he said he had sat in the living room for hours with his gun to shoot me when I walked in the door. He said he eventually got too tired and went to bed. Scary stuff. That was just one incident and that whole episode blew over and we were friends again. Another time I conned him into hiring an escort to come to the house for $200 and when she arrived 
I greeted her outside and she thought I was the one who hired her and we made out a little and I felt her up a little. Being an escort, she was nobody‚Äôs fool and she got back at both of us because they went into his room while I watched TV in the living room and after an hour she left but he came out angry and confused. He didn‚Äôt know I had fooled around with her. To get back at me, she didn‚Äôt even take off her clothes in his room and barely did anything and then left. Anyways, we had several run-ins and he would be angry and resort to drastic measures to get even. Eventually, we lost touch and I didn‚Äôt see or hear anything about him until ten years later when I joined a day program and an old friend was there too and he told me my poor friend had committed suicide about 5 years prior. I was shocked. It really affected me. I have had 5 friends andf acquaintances who killed themselves but his death affected me the most because we had been through a lot together. The reason I bring all this up is becaus
e he had helped me several times. He did other things besides lend me money. Once I tried to put a new starter on my car but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how it went on and he put it on for me and didn‚Äôt ask anything in return. Another time I was backing my car out of the driveway and ran into his parked car and put a tennis ball sized dent in it. I immediately told him and he just said, ‚ÄúAw, forget about it, it‚Äôs no big deal,‚Äù But in that regard, he did more for me then any other friend I‚Äôve ever had and it made such a big impression on me that I‚Äôve always wanted to help other people in some ways. And that takes me full circle as to why I‚Äôm on this site. When I helped that initial person it felt good. I didn‚Äôt start coming on here immediately every day. At first I came on here about once a month. Then it soon turned into every three weeks, then every week and eventually a few times a week and now it‚Äôs every day. People tell me I help or inspire them. I used to go on the ‚Äúparents only‚Äù forum 
and it was there I seemed to make the most impact. That‚Äôs where my experience seemed to help the most and it was there that I first started telling my story and the parents kept telling me my story gave them hope for their children with schizophrenia. I just kept getting encouraged and so now on these new forums I share my story with anyone who cares to listen and it seems to help people sometimes. I feel I‚Äôm lucky I am able to help or inspire anyone, in any way. The people here are cool and it just keeps me coming back. I‚Äôve had several friends IRL who had paranoid schizophrenia but until I came here I had never heard people be so _NAME_ and open about what they‚Äôve gone through with this disease. I get just as inspired by lots of people on here as I inspire them."

174365833,"hi _AT_MENTION_ , my schizophrenia was caused by chronic, childhood trauma at the hands of my primary caregivers. There were few protective factors so the trauma was very consistent & the damage extensive. My pdoc said the chronic stress caused gene expression to that of a schizophrenic. So you could say I needed to have those genes but their expression was caused by environment. If I‚Äôd had other genes, say Bipolar, then perhaps the gene expression would have been been that. I read a great book by a local Professor of Psychiatry. It was a very validating read as his research showed that (I think it was ) 30 % of schizophrenia is caused by child abuse. And the symptoms resemble the original abuse. For example, a voice may resemble (in content) that of the childhood abusers, a delusion about sperm in food resembles the original childhood sexual abuse. I can‚Äôt recall the author‚Äôs name, Professor _NAME_ maybe. A lovely & compassionate guy. Here‚Äôs my local Adult Survivors of Child Abuse info on 
the impacts of child abuse on mental health. . I went thru a stage of researching everything I could about it. I eventually got bored when I found out the damage to the brain is permanent and the treatments are just the same old, same old I‚Äôd already found unhelpful or damaging. I hope you can get to the bottom of your question & that it‚Äôs helpful."

176093728,"Well it‚Äôs actually extremely common (more common than people will see and admit to) and highly damaging and takes serious self reflection to realize the solution and deprogram from destructive tendencies. It‚Äôs unfortunate because it isn‚Äôt something many people will acknowledge in society at large. It sounds like something ‚Äòbad‚Äô to suggest our parents didn‚Äôt really love us and most will defend dysfunction without a second thought.

176093739,"There has been some confusion over my diagnosis that keeps changing/and because I sought out the psychiatrist in active addiction. He doesn‚Äôt know for sure. My mom has schizophrenia but sometimes I think she may also have Bipolar1 instead. If you have Bipolar1 with psychosis, you need an anti-psychotic or mood stabilizer. I have only had issues that I can think of, always triggered by something extreme. Anti-depressant, medications SSRI, SNRI, but not stimulants like Vyvanse or Cocaine. So that would mean I have more of a serotonin issue than dopamine right? I‚Äôm so confused but I‚Äôm trying to formulate my thoughts because my psychiatrist is calling me in an hour so I need to write this down so I can give him clear insight into what‚Äôs going on. Prozac induced hypomania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety, on top of lost sleep, it also made me hallucinate. Bipolar1 with psychotic features. There is a difference right?"
176093740,"The last time I used any psychedelic was in 1987. I never experienced any color phenomenon while on a recreational drug, now I have an extreme case of schizophrenia as a result of using them. I am able to function out of the hospital, as long as my life is not too demanding. I have a phenomenon some others have- psychedelic colors. It both gives me hope and makes me feel kind of bad. The colors are deeper and brighter than before. It started with the color red. It seems to be increasingly intense as time goes by. I have heard of this happening to others with my disease. I have also heard of it happening to normal people in old age. Has anyone here this phenomenon, I‚Äôd really love to know? I started getting the color change when I got into looking at _PERSON_ paintings. Otherwise I‚Äôd like to say I am doing well, back home from the hospital fighting the good fight."

I just want to say that sex is a sensitive subject to many and it could impact many individuals on this forum who was impacted by sexual abuse. I also have many friends who are victims of sexual abuse. Please know that there are some individuals who have religious or personal beliefs on preserving sex until marriage. Some regard sex as a sacred act, and some believe it is incredibly personal and should be only shared with their partner.

You were trying to understand the person who posted that, and that is okay.

174365846,"Earlier in the evening I met with the counselor who visits each unit about every three to four weeks. The last time we met, the neighbor lady I‚Äôm having trouble with came in to solve our differences. We talked for almost an hour and things went civilly and reasonably. I was guilty of saying a few ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù things to her when she sat out back and so we talked and agreed I would let her alone. Fine, no problem. Then we just talked about how I punched the wall a couple times in anger and how that was inappropriate. Fine, I quit cold turkey. And so we were all happy and good feelings abound. I was at work the next day about half-way through the day and the meeting crossed my mind and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I thought ‚ÄúWTH!‚Äù She‚Äôs been bugging me and driving me crazy for the last 6 months. And we hold an hour meeting and all that got accomplished was she gets let alone out back (fine). And that I stop what I‚Äôm doing. Fine. But basically the bottom line was that it was determined 
that she was 0% innocent and I was a 100% guilty. It took me a day for me to realize this. And I stewed about this. In fact, I got a letter where the property manager told me cease and desist bugging her and they actually itemized two incidents as evidence against me in the letter. And by the way, I‚Äôm not in the habit of picking on women, in fact I‚Äôm grateful that I get along with the women at work, I got along with ALL my sisters female friends. Some of them like me others are neutral and I‚Äôve actually known my older sisters oldest friends for more than twenty years and they are ALWAYS friendly to me and vice-versa. But this women neighbor looks like a friendly old woman on the outside but she is deeply disturbed and a non-schizophrenic. There‚Äôs being mean and being underhanded and there‚Äôs being sick and treating people worse than a dog. I mean she can be sincerely friendly and nice but yeah, her and the guy upstairs are deeply troubled, and he knows I think he‚Äôs scum. So the counselor and I are 
chatting and I told her that I didn‚Äôt want to spend the whole meeting on talking about me and the neighbors. BUT‚Ä¶ we talked about them and then after we got into talking I mentioned the prior meeting about making me look like I was bugging people for no reason and how that meeting made me look like I was arbitrarily bugging people unprovoked. And this counselor has known me for two years and I slowly saw it dawn in her eyes that that lady had lodged this complaint while the whole time she had been doing so much sh*t that she somehow conveniently left out of the complaint. And then me and the counselor got real and I started telling MY side of things. And so the bottom line was that the counselor wrote a complaint letter about the two women neighbors! And not only that but the counselor started making fun of them and saying just a couple of bad things about them! Who says life ain‚Äôt fair??!!! They can laugh at me all they want because that complaint letter is going to the property manager and it makes th
em look sooo bad. In fact, the counselor gave me this conspiratual look and said something like ‚ÄúYou gotta admit, you must feel a little good that you are turning the tables on them.‚Äù I had to laugh and admit, yeah, it feels a little good, and we both laughed. I barely mentioned the guy upstairs but he‚Äôs next. He thinks he‚Äôs so damned smart. These guys want to take advantage of someone but they‚Äôre about to learn something about not treating someone like an object to be controlled and not even treating them as human."

174365892,"Medication acts on cells, it uses acid to act on the dna production of the cells (which are using acid). It won‚Äôt do anything to your blood long term because blood doesn‚Äôt change. What will happen is that cells in your body will eventually recognise it and try to emulate the production and eventually the body will either fix itself or the body will require less and less of the medication. You should take whichever medication works for you. And then when symptoms improve, either reduce the medication dose or switch to one which has fewer side effects (after a long enough time using the strongest one like clozapine). The drs will help you if they see that you are and will help yourself! I hope things get better."

174365898,Been at 30 mg zyprexa for a week. It has helped a bit.
176093934,"So as you know I stopped taking my meds for a while now‚Ä¶ after month six, I was not feeling welll. I was having minor hallucinations (seeing things at the tip of my eye) I also was constantly having to get my self out of unusual and delusional beliefs. I was constantly on guard making sure no unusual belief would prosper in my mind. Hating antipsychotics and knowing how it changed my life for the worse, I decided to go see a naturopathic doctor. The doctor prescribed neuropas energy. What neuropas energy is a combination of three different herbs (st. johns wart, Passion flower, and valerian). Although this is typically used for minor depression, it is also used as a mood stabilizer; it can be used to inhibit serotonin, and dopamine receptors, resulting to work well with schizophrenia. It has little to none side effects and it does not impair cognitive function nor put you in a zombie/hangover state. After week 2 of taking neuropas balance, gone are the days of constantly being on guard of what I 
was thinking thus not resulting to fall in the rabbits hole. I also do not hallucinate anymore (although they were very minor to begin with). Going into week 5-6 of neuropas, it has been working very well, my mood has changed and starting to socialize more (keeping a good conversation and actually becoming a extrovert). Nerupas has placed me in a great/energetic feeling towards working out and tackling the day. I do really recommend neuropas balance for schizophrenia if symptoms are minor and you are willing to take a risk/reward resulting to relapse or resulting to stay stable on a very gentle supplement. I would recommend talking to your doctor about the supplement; maybe even try it out and see if it helps. If it does help you can always talk to your doctor about reducing your prescription alongside neuropas. This is my experience with neuropas balance!"
176093935,‚ÄúMay you live in interesting times‚Äù is a curse apocryphally attributed to Chinese lore.
174365894,"If you have had more than 1 psychotic episode, which you have, and it wasn‚Äôt drug induced, it is safe to say that you have a psychotic illness, whether that be schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar or other. This means that you need to take your medication. Getting off the medication will only cause problems, trust me, I have been there before, as many of us have. The last thing you want is to be on forced monthly injections instead of taking pills, as these doses are usually higher in comparison to the pill format previously given, and takes months for it to leave the system in case you are experiencing some unwanted side effects. Injections also cost more and it will be very hard to convince your Pdoc to put you back on pill form."

176093941,"I think the best thing we can do to keep a balanced weight is to have a balanced diet. I considered meal replacements before when i was trying to get control over my eating but i dont think theyre the best. Maybe just try to plan a few meals with your specific macro (fats, proteins, carbs) requirements. For example your requirements may be 50g of protein, 200g of carbs and 4 tbsp of fat per day resilting in 2400 calories Take that and divide it into three meals. The results should be pretty simple. Something like. 1 cup pasta, or 1 cup rice or 1 cup potatoes for carbs. Maybe 1 tbsp of oil. And 1 cup of some protein source like beans, tofu, or meat. Then add to that a large salad. Simple way to remember it is 1/2 the plate vegetables/salad 1/4 of the plate carbs 1/4 of the plate protein Then pour a tablespoon of butter/dressing over it. I think the key is not ‚Äúlosing weight‚Äù per se but gaining control of eating. Ive gone back and forth between eating way to much and starving myself, i think the 
key is complete balance. Also one thing that makes us eat more than we need is salt because it makes the body retain water which increases its virility and desire to consume more"

176094073,"Routine is good. Put some simple goals. I got some joy by buying a fitness tracker. 10,000 steps a day was an early goal and I still do that today. You have to fight the negatives. Stuff the horoscope. I used to follow the tarot and iching but have found that it‚Äôs total rubbish really. You make your own way in the world and currently predicting the future is beyond our technology. Seriously. Concentrate on what you can do now. I‚Äôd suggest. Exercise helps fight the negatives. Start there with simple goals. Walking briskly 3 times a week for half an hour helps fight heart disease and is a good start. I‚Äôve found exercise is a thing that helps you do more. It‚Äôs something that becomes routine and that is good for sz."

The guy was a science fiction genius/comical satirical brilliant. Loved sirens of titans the most.

And I don‚Äôt think he drank much other He was a true genius His life is pretty remarkable too. He fostered and took care of a whole rest of his family after his sister died I believe. This was before he was a famous writer, was a successful something else. But struggled a lot to provide food and shelter for as many people he did What a good guy Who can hate on _NAME_???"

I told him I owed him an apology that he was right. I have a medical condition and he said no apology needed. He said it was obvious I had one and nothing could be done until it was figured out and treated. He said if I see an audit for him to throw it in the shredder and added a smiley face.

My first psyche ward was like a country club; really new, good food, a pool table a ping-pong table, walks to the park, I went jogging with a counselor, they took us on a field trip. It overlooked some hills out in the back and I used to go out by myself and sit in a chair and enjoy the view. My next ward was the exact opposite, kind of old and dirty, the people there were very ill and pretty hardcore. I was pretty wary of all of them, I was in there because of a mistake. I checked myself in one night but my parents visited and once they got a look at the place and the type of people in there they got me out of there immidiately. Then it was on to the long term hospital for 8 months. and after that I stayed out of hospitals for 8 years before a nasty relapse sent me back in for 4 more visits in 1989. I was in some nice wards again. I remember they kept a 5 gallon container of ice cream in the freezer at all times that you could hel

174365992,"I had symptoms since I was 15, they gradually got worse and dangerous up until my diagnosis when I was 21 in 2011 when I tried suicide for the 2nd time. At 15 voices were calling me a cheater bcz I was studying and getting good grades. Then they called me the stupidiest person. At 16 I started socially isolating from my friends. I quit school. I searched the internet and though I had sz and autism but I refused that saying its impossible and didnt tell anyone, felt shameful. I tried tons of supplements, I think I had OCD too. I worked for a year and went back to school. At 18 I smoked pot and went in psychosis, punching doors, walls, mirrors, hearing robots talking, becoming catatonic etc Then at 19 voices told me to kill myself in a car accident at 200kmh in a snowstorm and I thought that would stop them, I ended up in the emergency. I told 3 general Drs about my voices and that things and me didnt feel real, they said its stress. Later I started believing that I am Jesus and seeing Jesus, hearing 
my priests, etc At 20-21 I tried proving that I am Jesus with suicide, intentional Tylenol overdose, vomited for an hour, ended up in the emergency. There I was seen by a psychiatrist, psychosis NOS."

Be careful with caffeine but i still drink a cup of coffee every morning. In the first week or so it might seem like it‚Äôs not helping but I would recommend giving it a month before you decide to quit if your psychiatrist prescribes it. Also, do you have positive symptoms often? I would not recommend it if you have positive symptoms. I have not had positive symptoms in awhile so I am able to tolerate it.

Slept okay overall and felt good the following day. However I build tolerance to Benadryl after a few days so I gotta switch it up. I built tolerance to Ambien within a few days. 5mg, then 10mg then it wouldn‚Äôt work. I stopped using it for 2 weeks, then 5mg worked again. Last night I took 25mg Doxylamine (Unisom) and 5mg melatonin and barely slept at all, not feeling the greatest today. It‚Äôs okay to take Ativan on occasion, like once a week to get a good sleep. Just don‚Äôt take benzos or z-drugs (Ambien, Lunesta, etc‚Ä¶) every day because they come with dependency issues when used long term every day, and you may build tolerance and they stop working.

176094431,Best answer would be from your psychiatrist.

176094433,Maybe you mistook someone else for him because of paranoia and/or mania
176094434,"i had some retrograde ejaculation for awhile. don‚Äôt have as much of a sex drive as i would off meds. only a certain type of woman can turn me on now, whereas before i could be turned on by normal everyday women. working out seems to help with sex drive a bit, that and losing a bit of fat has helped. if i were in a relationship i could probably have sex once or twice a week still. it doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore, im just a lot less sexual now on meds, in the first year or so it‚Äôs all i would talk about it to my pdoc. was my decreased libido. but now i generally don‚Äôt care anymore and focus more on relationships than i do sex."

176094436,"GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News ‚Äì 1 Feb 20 Gene Circuits Empower Next-Generation Cell and Gene Therapies Cells incorporating synthetic sense-and-respond gene circuitry may serve as ‚Äúliving drugs,‚Äù carrying out user-defined functions and outperforming traditional drugs, which are relatively static. Over the past few decades, we have seen remarkable advances in technologies for reading (sequencing) and writing (synthesizing) DNA. These technologies have enabled us to decipher disease. Now they are allowing us to program ‚Äúliving medicines‚Äù ‚Äîcell and gene therapies that reprogram genetic code. Traditional drugs, namely, small molecules and biologics, typically target proteins and block their function. These drugs are static. They have a predefined activity that can‚Äôt be adapted once they are delivered into patients. Living medicines, however, are dynamic. That is, they provide sense-and-respond functionality. As transformative as living medicines promise to be, they are s
till confined to narrow applications, having been of proven effectiveness against only a few monogenic diseases and hematological malignancies. Current approaches are limited to sensing and correcting single disease signatures, and they provide little control over their dosage, timing, or localization. These shortcomings can be overcome if synthetic biology is used to create the next generation of cell and gene therapies. These therapies will be programmable, and when they are broadly adopted, they will help treat, or even cure, many complex diseases. Programming cell and gene therapies with synthetic biology Synthetic biology applies engineering principles to program living systems, enabling them to perform user-defined functions. By leveraging advances in our ability to read and write DNA, we can engineer cells that incorporate artificial multigene constructs, referred to as gene circuits, that allow cells to make decisions and produce a desired response. Gene circuits are the ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù that can be dep
loyed into virtually any cell or gene therapy modality (the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù) to create adaptive therapies that can address many different disease areas. Programming biological systems with gene circuits can overcome the shortcomings of existing cell and gene therapy approaches by making them more controllable, targeted, and effective via multimodal activity. This is currently being developed for cancer but may be suitable for a wide variety of diseases that could potentially be treated with cell or gene therapy."

My doctor said alchol make it worst and i figure out thats true only if you are not medicate, if you are taling your meds every day, you can skip it the day you will drink and take the night dose only to and continue your life normally without risking nothing."

176094465,"I got OCD when i was very anorexic. I think i was lacking in some nutrients and somehow that lead to OCD maybe even via the stress of lack of energy. it was very effortful to walk up stairs, it was effortful to lift my head off the pillow in the mornings. so for me, i think it was a combination of stress and nutrient deficiency."

174366026,"Oh, if you‚Äôre asking me it happened when I first got sick in my early twenties. Long story short I was erratic and told her I thought we should break up. We were together for 2 years and had known each other since childhood. She remained my friend for a few more years until I lost my mind and then she cut me off completely. Just ghosted me. I think I‚Äôd make her sad with my situation. She‚Äôd cry sometimes. I think she loved who I was and not what became of me. I told her I couldn‚Äôt be friends with her because I still loved her. I regret it. I was having episodes of psychosis and was out of touch with reality. To this day I miss her, even as a friend. It is part of life. She‚Äôs not the only one who cut ties with me during moments when I was out of it."

No. Could I have bipolar? Maybe. Aspergers? Yes, but mild. Could the energy drinks be ruining my life and causing psychosis and low functioning behaviors? Definitely. I feel like the shadow government, illuminati, and aliens are or were trying to make me sick and insane. I probably do have a microchip. When I had my bad drug trip at college, I remember having paranoid dreams where scientists or greys were operating on my brain. It‚Äôs real. Is it recording my thoughts, brainwaves, blocking memories? I‚Äôm not sure. I remember stuff from previous lives even before the collapse of the previous universes and they affect my emotions. Not sure how or why. Many worlds theory, super position, or entanglement? The universe is a computer so maybe I‚Äôm connected to that probably. I tried extremely hard to cure my insanity even in my past

Like maybe plotting them in places to plan assassinations? Or use them to do jobs in North Korea? I just feel like they will create me to be him and use me for some negative purpose so that I go to hell. I had visions of hell and some Jewish kids were telling me I would go there. Then after hearing _PERSON_ it became the North Korean dictator. That I would become that. The trauma of experiencing that makes me still fearful or believe it might come true. Even though when I‚Äôm now talking about it it doesn‚Äôt seem like a real thing. It‚Äôs just going from really believing this would happen to not is a bridge that is hard to pass to. Because it felt so strong before."
174366053,"Thanks for sharing. I‚Äôve never liked the label schizophrenia. I have accepted this label now but I mentally substitute schizophrenia for shaman. I also like thinking that I‚Äôm a story teller and creative thinker. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs available in your area, but there is a lot of support groups in the community available for people like us. I found it a good place to start and learn how to build relationships. It‚Äôs a bit easier when I‚Äôm not stressing out over what I need to say vs. what I want to say. Feelings aren‚Äôt dumb, nor are they ever wrong. They just are part of being human, and even people without schizophrenia experience that."

176094557,"SMS = Serotonin Modulator and Stimulator. Don‚Äôt know much about the pharmacology or chemistry. Comparing to how I remember Zoloft making me feel, I would say Viibryd doesn‚Äôt quite do as much magic, but at least it doesn‚Äôt come with the side effect of delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia which Zoloft caused me. Zoloft helped me to be less socially inhibited, more relaxed and less shy, and I had a much brighter outlook on life (note that I was taking this in conjunction with Lithium for mood stabilization). Now the Viibryd just seems more like a stimulant - it gives me more energy, verbal spontaneity and hypervigilance, but I still experience full-on OCD. It doesn‚Äôt totally lift me out of depression like Zoloft did, but it gives me the energy and upbeat-ness to do well with a job and in school, and to be able to hold a good conversation. Diarrhea? Sounds like something that would happen indicating serotonin syndrome - which could happen if you are also taking other antidepressants which overfloo
d your brain with serotonin. A 10mg or 20mg dose shouldn‚Äôt do that. But I guess people‚Äôs experiences with side effects can always differ. I don‚Äôt experience any side effects and I take 50mg a day in conjunction with Lamictal and Buspar. Sure, taking an antipsychotic isn‚Äôt going to cancel out the effects of other medications I don‚Äôt think. I just started taking Geodon on top of everything else and I don‚Äôt think it interferes. I have to recommend 5-HTP to you as well, if you have not already heard of it. It is a serotonin-support supplement you can get on Amazon or a drugstore. When I decided the Viibryd and Lamictal just weren‚Äôt doing enough, I started taking 5-HTP capsules several times a day and it really boosted my wellness."
176094558,Oh I was so angry last week. The doctor had decreased my depo from 400 mg every other week to 400 mg Clopixol every 3 week. So therefore I raised my Seroquel dose to 600 mg. After 3 days I had no anger issues anymore.

Then passed that French course with 87% I aced it and it was the highest grade in my class. I was in the top college in my city and in the neighboring city. Then I got in an English university.

Our commonality though is health issues, and (not so much) a need to be amused(if I‚Äôm even achieving that). Guilt makes a person talk; but trying to prove innocence does the same thing. That sentence shows thoughtfulness, and I‚Äôm currently of the standpoint that, THAT - is certainly appropriate and enough."
176094656,"wow! That would totally depend on my mood at the time. Certain things hit the spot at times. But a good meal would consist of a delicious meat like BBQ meatloaf burgers or tri tip or even chicken, a potato component, like garlic mashed potatoes or even just a loaded baked potato, and then finally a veggie, and for that you can do all sorts of things, you can do _NAME_ slaw, or sautee brussell sprouts with a little bacon, or steam some broccoli and cauliflower or just cut up carrots, celery, bell peppers and cucumbers. So I guess the ideal meal is meat, potato and veggie. Now I‚Äôm hungry lol"
176094657,Headphone _NAME_ is an output. Microphone is an input. Doesn‚Äôt work. You‚Äôll need an interace that accepts a mic level input if your mic has a 1/4 inch _NAME_. Maybe get a USB mic or plug the 1/4 _NAME_ of your mic into an interface that connects to your computer via USB.
176094658,Great some good stories‚Ä¶I sometimes get into even bad ones‚Ä¶sometimes for years‚Ä¶what kind of books and from where?
176094659,"Great - I am really impressed by those of you who can manage a job despite SZ and psychosis. I could for years too, but not anymore."
176094660,I feel like people are watching and they will make this happen because they feed off my fear. Or something like that.
176094661,Best of wishes you‚Äôll ace it
176094662,I‚Äôm treating them like idle thoughts and saying with disapproval ‚ÄúWhere is your mind?‚Äù. It could be in a better place.
176094663,but the news did happen in china
176094664,I have no peer.
176094665,"In the grander scheme of things nothing in the external matters that much anyway. Everything is temporary, love, happiness, sadness, life etc. According to _PERSON_, the only true essence without an opposite is your inner presence and will go on eternally. Not living in the past or the future is the best you can do. Being ever present will eventually bring calm and peace apparently. I‚Äôm giving it a try anyway."
176094666,Thanks leafy _AT_MENTION_
176094667,I think a head injury affects it.
176094668,I have anywhere from 2 to 5 cups a day. I used to drink much more. Its best if I keep it to no more than 3.
176094669,I hate voices. I withdraw from them. I wake up every morning with no love for life. I know I am unappreciative. I can‚Äôt help the way I feel.
176094670,It happened to me. It honestly has not affected my ability to function in a noticeable way. Staying on medication is the best way to prevent it from getting worse.
174366098,Well #1 is I‚Äôm off lithium. Zoloft has been a great addition to the clozapine
176094671,Ha thanks. Weathers sweet. in Galway at the minute. It‚Äôs buzzin. Suppose to be the best day of the week today. Enjoying it!
176094672,"Also, if this is making you paranoid that someone will see it you can flag it and ask for it to be deleted."
174366100,I‚Äôm bipolar not schizophrenic. I am on 4.75mg risperidone. I immediately got anhedonia and lack of motivation. I am not interested in anything. Never in 20 years since diagnosed have I had these problems and felt this way. It‚Äôs completely the medication for me.
176094673,"Yes,very quickly. I devoured his books. Now this by _PERSON_ is the best book about paris commune. Paris commune was one of the finest and most humane revolutions"
174366092,"i have one voice. we all have one voice. I can‚Äôt help but feel, that there is all too often an effort to form a consensus of voice and rob the world of our diversity of voice. I see propaganda everywhere in the media, they all get in line and spout the same view or two and we are just that much poorer for it. I would like to see more independent media, but often is it just the same views. it surely must be a conspiracy, how do they all get in line and think the same things? well I guess you can enjoy your neverending wars and such, thankfully I am but a schizophrenic and the battlefield is not my fate."
176094674,That‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm glad you don‚Äôt have to wait long
176094675,Plus a bachelors degree. Which is about 4 years of school to get‚Ä¶ But 2 years and your half way done And 1 year is a quarter of the way there And you are already pretty educated in the holistic side of things So you would probably fly through naturopathic med school without a problem‚Ä¶ So 4 years to get your bachelors and another 4 years of med school
176094676,It‚Äôs time to look elsewhere for help.
176094677,"I have beautiful feet today. I didn‚Äôt always. I healed up my feet with a combination of good podiatry care, cleaning my feet really well and frequently with soap and water, and by keeping my tub and shower really clean. And also by changing my socks daily."
176094678,"I just like hearing about people trying to recover, so all"
176094679,"Sometimes I do feel good. But sometimes, for no apparent reason, I feel bad. For me one of my most important questions is how to control my mood. And I don‚Äôt know. I struggle for a while and do a few simple things, and then the mood improves."
174366107,Ok you didn‚Äôt have them as long as me. Have had them 8 years and 50% better.
176094680,i also have trouble with spoken language. It‚Äôs hard to follow conversations. Written is better for me but my brain is like it doesn‚Äôt have enough space to capture the full sentence and make sense of it. Like the memory is full before the sentence is finished and then gets erased and only part of the sentence can be understood.
176094681,"I dont know yet, im hoping for just something simple on campus like a desk job but there‚Äôs a lot of options and departments I could work at"
174366095,"So far aripiprazole has been great for me. I‚Äôm full of energy, I‚Äôm not depressed, I‚Äôm not constantly hungry and I‚Äôm sleeping better. I‚Äôve only just started reducing the olanzapine so it‚Äôs to early to tell how well it works as an ap tho."
174366096,"I am sorry that you are feeling that way, I am diagnosed too and since my first hospita! Time, I have lost all my family,the only person I still keep in contact with is my ex - fiance from 28 years ago.It is so hard on me,because I have a grandson from my daughter,who I have only seen pictures of. I now love in an assisted living facility with 72 other people who are very hard to deal with because we all are here for different reasons. Phone responded to this and I had to change my _NAME_ but for years I was little kitty or just kitty."
176094682,"I‚Äôm on Olanzapine, it helps lower my paranoia. I have gained weight on it though."
176094683,"_AT_MENTION_ I also think pot made my sZ worse, I think i had symptoms before pot. But Pot made it bad. What you were saying about Alien races, etc‚Ä¶ What if our meds are suppressing our reality which the world calls symptoms. Just a thought. I‚Äôm still gonna take the meds. I also love Westworld. the great Sci Fi‚Äôs, Battlestar Galactica, Capricorn too. No you‚Äôre not crazy I think we live in alternate realities sometimes and we are glitches in the system."
176094684,"Sorry, I am unsure if I understand?"
176094685,_AT_MENTION_ do you still have haldol as a PRN ? If so I think you should take it. See if that calms you down. There‚Äôs no way a hospital is going to just let you in for an MRI. So you can‚Äôt go. Even if they would you don‚Äôt have the money for it all.
174366101,I had negative symptoms long before I was put on antipsychotics. I would put things off until they became a crisis. It sucked.
176094686,"Well, for one thing you really are human whether you like it or not. All you have to do is bring it out in yourself."
176094687,One more pound lost. 16 since starting Zyprexa and 67 total. 33 more pounds to lose to get to my short-term goal of 100 pounds lost.
176094688,"had to ask but because of the younger group, shouldn‚Äôt sex ? be answered by you Dr or other care health centers?"
176094689,"Yeah, mindfulness and meditation was hard for me, too. But neurofeedback feels different. It feels like you are playing a video game and it really keeps you feeling engaged and hits the reward centers. Instead of trying to force yourself into reprogramming through willpower and breathing exercises that can be hard to remember, you just follow directions. The results are pretty immediate, too. In the beginnign they are sublte, but still noticeable. But after like a month, I was a whole different person. I got referred at age 17 right after being hospitalized for severe OCD. My hands were always bloody, I would pass out because I had rituals associated with breathing, it was real bad. I was also having migraines twice a week, severe enough to make me throw up."
174366102,Clozapine is the most effective but it also has the most side effects which is why it‚Äôs normally only used after other meds have failed.
176094690,"Maybe this is better?? _NAME_ ""Band of Gold"" covered by Sir _PERSON_ The Who_PERSON_"
176094691,"^ Thanks . Having my stepdaughter onside made a big difference. The right family support can make a real,positive difference."
176094692,"It‚Äôs definitely something you should talk to your therapist about. It could be caused by a lot of things. But the important thing to understand is that, while you can‚Äôt control your emotions, you CAN control the way you express them. You may never get over feeling upset when your boyfriend masturbates. But you can definitely learn coping strategies so you don‚Äôt take it out on him and make unreasonable demands."
176094693,I too suffer from debilitating anxiety that causes my hands and legs to shake uncontrollably. I don‚Äôt take any medication for it but have tried Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in the past without success. It may work for you though.
176094694,"Abstracts are just as scientific, as the article, that‚Äôs where they present the findings, in the most concise way . . You can find the articles by _PERSON_ the title, which is on the pictures, I think . ."
176094695,Nope. I hope this delusion goes away with time.
176094696,"This is a yes or no question, so I can say yes if it‚Äôs a paltry amount. Even if, generally, people are awful."
176094697,Family relatives came over today. I socialised woohooo
176094698,I probably won‚Äôt be in good enough shape to do anything.
176094699,Welcome to the forum. Hope you will enjoy the forum and feel better soon.
174366113,"_AT_MENTION_ that‚Äôs pretty mean. If you haven‚Äôt experienced the same side effects as he has, it‚Äôs easy to judge."
176094700,"That makes sense, thank you for explaining. Medicine is important in recovery, so try to stay on track and be consistent(easier said than done, I know). I hope your journey is filled with progress."
176094701,Do you work for a franchise?
176094702,You got this!
176094703,"Same here my friend. Been falling behind on classwork again and exams are coming up. Hope you get some rest soon, its a rough go insomnia is"
176094704,That sucks. But a week isn‚Äôt all that long.
176094706,I‚Äôm starting to like poetry. last one i swear. love yourself 'fore I am gone and everytime u need a laugh just remember ill carry on thru ur unborn child and live forever by ur side
176094707,I understand. Going through a similar thing. Working on getting out.
174366103,It helped me apparently
174366109,I was taking olanzapine _PERSON_
176094708,_AT_MENTION_. Nurse is closed mom is a medical pro and suggested my anxiety med‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre trying to keep me out of hospital
176094709,yea sorry to hear about that‚Ä¶ i hope you can help him =)
176094710,does latuda stop stimulant effects like caffeine.
176094711,I managed to do pump yesterday. I got tattoos despite that I will get in trouble when family finds out. I stood up for my right to have different taste than them .well kind of as they don‚Äôt know yet.ha ha ha ha ha
174366124,Thanks for your feedback. I am now thinking it might be part of the negative symptoms of sz: lack of motivation. Or persistent depression.
176094712,I ll take it next weak monday or tuesday I feel good after taking it Thanks god What about you ?
176094713,Who am i in this fight? Whose part should I take? Mesah√° is a lovely place based on my beautiful mind. And Satani√¢ also abides in my beautiful mind
176094714,Lol yeah good sh iiit?:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I wanted to age naturally and even go hairy but changed my mind when I got a big wrinkle between my eyes that made me look grumpy all the time.
174366106,Amisulpride is good for positive symptoms but it elevates prolactin even at low doses.
174366110,"It stopped your negative symptoms? How severe were they? I stay in bed all day everyday, only get up to eat. In bed I am either sleeping or on this forum. I am 30 y.o. and I gained 165lb, taking meds for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes meds."
176094715,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is definitely a major life challenge, having no governor on your emotions, but it responds very well to Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT). I know this very well as my lovely wife lives with BPD and is doing very well and were very happy. Good luck. Get in a community DBT program, typically 2 hrs a week (virtual nowadays). Best of everything to you! Also, it is very important that your husband read about BPD or watch a few videos on it so he understands why your behaviour is the way it is. It will help build a bridge. Hang in there as there is light at the end of the tunnel. The first thing to learn is that BPD is not your fault. You didn‚Äôt choose to be BPD, it was an instantaneous development in the womb. Not your fault."
176094717,"Well, at least you know it‚Äôs a comfort you can turn to."
174366111,Today my nurse put me abilify
176094718,"I‚Äôm not sure how piano works, I play guitar. With guitar IMO all you need is to be a better player than the student. Even I could give guitar lessons to the right people."
174366105,"In hindsight, I sorta knew i was schizophrenic all along. I think its because i wasnt responding to treatment as an EUPD - and the symptoms i was having didnt fit. Soon as i found out, with my box of risperadone to wean onto, i just sat and cried for a couple of hours. I thought my life was over - but it was a relief to know why i wasnt like everyone else."
176094719,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ thanks ! I remember I got into a lil altercation with you, I‚Äôm personally sorry about that."
176094720,So I used to be a ‚Äúsmart little girl with no heart‚Äù. And that‚Äôs not where happiness is.
176094721,Welcome _AT_MENTION_ Cigarettes were enough to bother my mind. I quit smoking 4 1/2 years ago and am making slow progress although I have to be on oxygen. You are smart to realize your mistake early in your life. Good for you.
176094722,Psychiatrists are not counselors (generally speaking in the US.) They do medication management. I like short appointments with my psychiatrist. No need to be friends; I just want my meds.
174366121,Yeah i think I‚Äôm schizoaffective bipolar type
176094723,What do you know about wisdom teeth removal that we don‚Äôt? There must be something lurking in the back of your brain that is causing the fear. Take a few deep breaths and think about it. Ask yourself what is bothering you about it and see what your brain comes up with‚Ä¶
176094724,"how would you answer the question, if someone asked u?"
176094725,I‚Äôm 39 off and on here more so past few years.
176094726,Thanks ninjastar
176094727,I have a malicious ‚Äúvoice‚Äù in my thoughts coming from a little man with a panamahat! He looks a little like my stepfather . that vicious ???????.
176094728,I stopped taking my morning meds because I hate the fact that I‚Äôm on so many meds. Sixteen. I just stopped. I need to start taking them again but I don‚Äôt want to. Now that I say it out loud I realize how stupid I am. Ugh.
176094729,It helped me with akathisia and leg cramps.
176094730,‚ÄúPull-up on them like CJ from San _NAME_‚Äù
176094731,5mg?!? You might as well not even be on meds? I could be wrong though.
176094732,"You‚Äôll gain weight then if you eat a lot. Also not eating healthy increases stroke, blood pressure and heart attack risk even if your cholesterol is normal. Also pills can have side effects at high doses."
176094733,"Minor Trigger Warning, alcohol talk‚Ä¶ My relationship towards alcohol is a strange one. Basically I resist inebriation during the first several shots or beers. Then, eventually, I hit a point where my inhibitions go away and I‚Äôm an idiot. Then I have fun and fall asleep and have nightmares and wake up with a headache. So it‚Äôs either drink a little and feel nothing, or drink a bunch and feel like king of the world then possibly vomit and fall asleep. I‚Äôm not an AA guy, I believe people should be allowed to have fun every now and then. However I‚Äôm the type of guy who gets really happy when I drink, not the kind to get really angry. I‚Äôve seen enough domestic violence movies/shows to know alcohol is a horrible thing for some people so I try not to talk about it."
176094734,omg it is horrible fact mental illness cause all of these
176094735,It took me about six years to shake the paranoia
176094736,Except it meant too much to me if I meant anything I guess I can‚Äôt let it get to me
176094737,I wish I did it way sooner but physical fitness really does help me mentally as well. It‚Äôs hard to start but once you get on a roll it gives good results for what is basically free. I‚Äôm fitter now at 49 than I was in my thirties when first diagnosed. Wasted a few years but I‚Äôd recommend a check in with your gp to make sure there‚Äôs no issues and then a decent amount of regular exercise.
176094738,"Mine is waaay to sensitive to be a doctor. I mean he has a picture of his wife on his desk and all I said was that I fantasize about having wild animal sex with his wife out on a deserted beach somewhere at _USER_ID_ and from his reaction, you would have thought I insulted him or something. I was just trying to be nice. C‚Äômon doc, if you can‚Äôt stand the heat then get out of the kitchen."
176094739,your name is human after all
176094740,"Seroquel 200 mg Melatonin 6 mg Trazodone 50 mg as needed Klonipin 0.5 mg as needed I take a lot of meds for insomnia because it is a real problem for me. And even with all of these, sometimes I am up all night."
176094741,There‚Äôs no shame in applying for benefits. You paid into the system. It‚Äôs not a handout. It‚Äôs an insurance policy you‚Äôve invested heavily into.
176094742,"Everybody gossips. I think you shouldn‚Äôt let it bother you too much, We‚Äôve all been guilty of it."
176094743,"I blamed my dysfunctional family for my sz. I feel like leaving them and getting an apartment. I am glad tho that I still live with them for they are all I have. My sister came over and we celebrated my parents anniversary When any of us are in a good mood It makes me say it is all my sz, making me want to leave them. Nothing beats being around them when they are in good happy moods‚Ä¶"
176094744,yea tell somebody you feel homicidal‚Ä¶ like pdoc or gp doc or somebody at the ER‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt let it get worse
176094745,That‚Äôs a different med. This is lumateperone not roluperidone.
176094746,_PERSON_ received ideas when there was no such technology around
176094747,It‚Äôs a pain to be such a liar about being interested in some people.
176094748,"It doesn‚Äôt say its for sz, don‚Äôt worry. I think its just for severely disabled patients like the ones with severe intellectual disability or severe autism, at least thats what they say in the article. But still even these people should have equal rights as others but in the article they say that these patients can‚Äôt really do the post surgery treatment due to intellectual disability. Like they have to do complicated things to survive, complicated for them and they will die if they don‚Äôt strictely follow treatment instructions."
176094749,I was there for three days observation. Some staff members called me into the office and told me I don‚Äôt belong there. I agreed with that. They released me and I was shocked that the diagnosis was psychosis.
176094750,with buttons with beads
176094751,Enjoy your second flag!
176094752,Risperdal Sertraline Vraylar
176094753,I hope so _AT_MENTION_
174366115,No one is watching you. It‚Äôs a symptom of schizophrenia. I used to think the same until I got on antipsychotics and now I feel privacy. Tell your doctor and try Abilify or a medication that stops you thinking like that. Your privacy is all yours.
174366116,I work full time. If I just sit at home on the couch it‚Äôs much worse. I like to be doing something to take my mind off my illness and just watching tv doesn‚Äôt work. But it took me years to get where I could work feasibly. The first six years it just wasn‚Äôt possible. I went through 7 jobs. But I did keep trying to get back up but it was really a tough lesson to learn. I take a lot of meds now. I used to always try to be coming off meds and asked to be dosed down or to come off at every visit. Now I am happy maxed out. Life is much better that way.
176094754,"I already tried that, thay said I am blaming everything on sz and that I am choosing to stay in bed all day everyday until I die on purpose."
176094755,"Yessss‚Ä¶ California pizza kitchen, but specifically the bbq chicken one!"
176094756,"No, it‚Äôs amisulpride, abilify is ariprapazole"
176094757,Neat discussion and I appreciate your open approach.
176094758,My psychologist at the psych ward was like ‚Äúmm im very understandable but i need my fix so here you have my _PERSON_ in your face‚Äù
176094759,One or two bottles of wine
176094760,Its my liver enzymes and cholesterol that were high on Zyprexa.
176094761,"I‚Äôve been trying to be supportive, I just feel like I‚Äôm not helping‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think sending her the suicide hotline will help‚Ä¶ I think she needs positive encouragement"
176094762,im trying my best thats all i can do.
174366119,im drinking broccoli smoothie about one week‚Ä¶ nothing change for now
176094763,"Uh, 50 minutes went by faster than you thought, it doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal. Heck, the half hour at work before lunch flies by. At work I often lose track of time. After lunch, I don‚Äôt have a break until 2:00. Often an hour goes by but I‚Äôm so busy I don‚Äôt look at my watch but when I finally do I am usually surprised at how fast and how much time went by."
176094764,"I hope I‚Äôm able to stay out of the dispensaries. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed since March, but ‚Ä¶ F‚Ä¶ I need to file smoking weed with drinking Within my brain. I don‚Äôt have a problem with staying out of the liquor stores‚Ä¶"
176094765,"So. Void. Existence. Coexistence. Creation. Togetherness. Life. Love. Bond. Life. Future. (TBC) P.s. Hope, Trust, True Love, Honesty, Joy, And Eternal Peace!."
176094766,But my boyfriend is the devil. The _PERSON_ says it‚Äôs real. Also me going to North Korea is connected to my boyfriend being the devil.
174366117,"My psychotic symptoms have mostly subsided, and I‚Äôve come to find that I‚Äôm aimless, bored, she alone. I act like a f√∫cking child because that‚Äôs what I was when I started getting sick, and now, nearing the age of 21, I no longer have a place in the world. I just don‚Äôt know how to be 21. It feels like everyone expects me to just catch up, get with the program, get my life back on track, but I don‚Äôt know how to do that any better than I currently am. For 7 years, my life stopped, and now that it‚Äôs picking back up, I‚Äôve got what feels like a severe case of whiplash because for me, time jolted forwards. At least when I was psychotic, I had something driving me, but this emptiness isn‚Äôt any better, just differently bad. I wanted to get a job, but my mom said I wasn‚Äôt ready, so I applied for disability and I got it, first try. Go me, I guess. Congrats on being certifiably schizophrenic. Even a freaking stranger can tell that I‚Äôm not ready to live in the real world. I really thought I 
was. I could‚Äôve been, if things hadn‚Äôt gone so horribly wrong. I thought I was over this anger. Life‚Äôs not fair, I know. I get it. It‚Äôs just, when I was psychotic, I was in trouble. Now, I‚Äôm just in pain."
176094767,"To answer the question, no the outcome won‚Äôt change regardless of when treatment is started."
174366123,I am trying my best to be strong. I‚Äôm constantly hearing voices saying that they are coming to kill me and that I just do not realize that it‚Äôs real this time. I‚Äôm constantly telling myself it‚Äôs not real. I remind myself that I have schizophrenia. That during my last hospital stay I believed in hundreds of different delusions and none of them were real. Not just the hospital. I‚Äôve had schizophrenia since 1992 I have a long history of voices telling me I‚Äôm going to die I cant even count how many times I have had threatening voices and NONE of them have ever come true. So I have a strong foundation here. It‚Äôs just that I keep hearing the voices‚Ä¶ they dont stop. I know that it‚Äôs just a matter of time‚Ä¶ It will eventually pass and I know it will‚Ä¶ it has in the past and it will now. it‚Äôs just the waiting is so nerve racking.
176094768,"God tests me, with fake people and voices"
176094769,"I thought _NAME_ was my cousin, related on my father‚Äôs side, I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have sent him my book, but felt compelled to, I think _NAME_ blames me for costing her the election, my private thoughts on why I was so racist were coupled with very little about my actual psychotic experiences, just theory on how to cope with them some books are never meant to be published, though most authors who claim that are lying. Why did I feel the need to explain the obvious to my relatives?"
176094770,I liked AHS before but I find it boring tbh
176094771,"I‚Äôm trying to tell you I didn‚Äôt mean any offense. That It‚Äôs offensive to YOU, I can‚Äôt control the way you feel. Surely, it‚Äôs because it hurts. People complain that they don‚Äôt want you to use the term ???????? any more. Because it hurts to be ????????. Changing the word doesn‚Äôt change the condition. So, someone innocently refers to someone as ???????? and gets reprimanded for their choice of words. Not knowing any better is a reason. I see the word was blocked. What is the correct word now DD?"
176094772,Why can‚Äôt you try for online consultation with your old pdoc?
176094773,"Yay a fellow physics head! I agree, but I kinda dumbed it down a bit because a lot of people misunderstand wave-particle duality. Its very hard to wrap your head around the fact that, until something is observed or interacted with, it is both a particle and a wave at the same time. That is to say, these frequencies overlap, build on each other or cancel each other out, like ripples on a pond. Until they are observed or interacted with, at which point they collapse based on a probability function. Its fascinating really, but our minds werent built in a way that we can comprehend it easily, because we are so far removed from the fundamental particles we study that, at the macroscopic level, we see things as definite and not inherently random. This is because we observe, for the most part, the particles/waves that have collapsed and have ‚Äúchosen‚Äù a place to be. We describe quantum tunneling, but it is really just a collapse of the probabilities allowing for a particle/wave to collapse to a locatio
n that it should not be, according to classical understanding. Great points, Im really glad I have someone to talk to about this stuff lol"

176094780,"I ain‚Äôt aware of a lot of sh*t when I‚Äôm out in public. I sometimes get the occasional idiot who honks his horn. It‚Äôs rare so I shrug it off and just keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. I am just a tiny bit worried that starting about two months ago when I‚Äôm parked some cars have acted a little weird around me. Even at work, I was sitting down hunched over my phone surfing YouTube on my break and the building was pretty empty and dark and I thought I heard a noise and looked up to see a woman soldier peering around a corner quietly watching me. Weirdo. She laughed nervously and mumbled something and slunk away. But I ain‚Äôt going to let a 3 second incident stop me from doing what I want. It‚Äôs a mad, mad, mad, mad world.

176094783,_AT_MENTION_ you have to admit you need help and then reach out for it. You‚Äôre very sick and should probably be in the hospital. If only for a break.

176094797,Mental illness can be very cyclic. I get episodes in spring. Before meds I‚Äôd have major episodes every 5 years. I‚Äôve no idea why it is but it is very common. Important thing is to take the meds as prescribed and always search for better function.
174366133,No not at all. I am saying that voices and delusions play out in a world where they have been influenced by the media and religious indoctrination. If you didn‚Äôt have those influences then the illness would still pervade but in a different way.

176094821,I read one of your posts on this topic and it was really helpful. Ive made a lot of associations with my neg thoughts and now every day things remind me of the thoughts I dont want to have.

In short Idk about you but I don‚Äôt see much hope for me. Even if I put up a profile for a ld relationship on a dating site‚Äî unlikely to work. And I hate dating sites with a passion.

174366142,"I receive Abilify injections, 400 mg every three weeks, and I take 5 mg/day of oral Haldol I do better with the addition of the Haldol, compared to when I was just receiving the shot. It might contribute to my slowed movements, though; I am now incapable of doing fast-paced work, simply cannot move that fast."
176094833,"Yeah I lived a lonely life before diagnosis. I was a gangly, smart person who had an underlying problem of racing thoughts and paranoia. Meds really helped me. I didn‚Äôt really have a real relationship till I was 31. I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed till I was 29. Lots of wasted years and it‚Äôs amazing I got through life till then but lots of family support and not knowing what was the problem. Have faith. Hang in there and you just do things to make yourself better. Things like relationships come from that. Get into a good headspace to connect to people. Took zyprexa and effexor for me to have a decent time‚Ä¶That took a while to get too but so worth it."

176094840,"Here is an interesting bit: ‚ÄúMost tasks involved passive reactivity, meaning these areas largely reflect activation patterns for passive viewing of unpleasant scenes and faces.‚Äù which means that the person experiencing the negative and unpleasant scenes do not actively respond or resist to them.

174366128,"This is probably going to be my dumbest and stupidest post online for all time lol. Not sure why I‚Äôm posting this. I‚Äôm good at finding patterns. This post is purely for entertainment purposes. First off the bat, I‚Äôm insane and have a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. I‚Äôm constantly paranoid, think I won‚Äôt make it the next day, and think I could be in trouble a lot for my delusions and psychosis. But it‚Äôs not true. ALL of my delusions are outlandish and insane and nobody believes them. I believe in freedom and free speech but I‚Äôm more of a Law and Order kind of guy. See, I thought I was a lot of people including fictional people, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm truly insane with possible multiple personality disorder from parallel universes and being in chronic fiction ie I watch TV and think it‚Äôs all me. That all the characters and cartoons are about me and I‚Äôm the characters on TV. Not sure what kind of schizophrenia that is‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs me. That‚Äôs what I suffer from and have. Anyways, 
I was looking up Bitcoin again because I‚Äôm just curious a lot. They don‚Äôt know who invented Bitcoin but his pseudo name is _USER_ID_. It‚Äôs seriously not me, but I tend to believe in a lot of fake things, so why not let me think I‚Äôm _USER_ID_ I‚Äôve been paranoid for 10 years, think I‚Äôm going to be murdered or tortured every night or practically some day for no reason whatsoever. That something happened to me in college but I‚Äôll never find out and I‚Äôll never figure out. Furthermore, I think aliens were after me in my past lives and that the government or aliens gave me permanent schizophrenia for eternity. Just my story and 2 cents about it. That I know the cure for schizophrenia and that stuff like that pisses people off. That I just want to be alone and be safe as well as my family being safe. We are poor people. en.wikipedia.org _USER_ID_ is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's o
riginal reference implementation. As part of the implementation, _PERSON_ also devised the first blockchain database. In the process, _PERSON_ was the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until _PERSON_ has ... Like I said it‚Äôs not me. He‚Äôs the 44th richest man in the world and I‚Äôm only worth $100 right now. He‚Äôs worth like $10 billion dollars today. He could be worth $100 billion in the future or even a trillion if things go right. Obviously, that‚Äôs not me. I‚Äôm poor as ???? and a nobody schizophrenic with no future. I would like free money or donations but that doesn‚Äôt seem to happen. I‚Äôm not _NAME_ who can sue and get money. I‚Äôll never get a penny from the government for being a MK-Ultra victim. Even if I did, it wouldn‚Äôt be that much and might take decades or more for my family to get it down the road. I rather just be left alone. I worry about being homeless in the future. Anyw
ays, I keep on thinking. How do I get money? Why did the government give me money in a past life? Nobody else gets money and most people in my situation don‚Äôt get ????. So my theory is that Bitcoin was created by a team of Libertarians, possibly rich and smart people, from the future or from outside the simulation or from another dimension when Totalitarian, dystopian world government took foot and that it was sent back in time to protect the average American. I don‚Äôt support bitcoin, don‚Äôt have any access to money, and nothing. Even if I was tortured, I wouldn‚Äôt believe it or have any money. So don‚Äôt suspect me and nobody does. Even if I was him, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to get the money lol. I haven‚Äôt read into Bitcoin or his story or wiki page too far. Personally, I remember Bitcoin going over $100,000 in the future and I‚Äôm worried about Quantum Computers hacking Bitcoin or bad people. I‚Äôm constantly paranoid. I don‚Äôt know how bitcoin works, I can‚Äôt even keep my codes and wallet right, and 
only had $7 in there and lost it all. Personally, I think _PERSON_ was involved in creating bitcoin but he denied it I think. He‚Äôs one of the few geniuses around that can do it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he admitted it down the road. Maybe nobody remembers including him. I mean nobody remembers me from my past lives. mind wipes? mandela effect? I don‚Äôt know how to program, I‚Äôm not interested in digital currency, and what not. I couldn‚Äôt even do this ???? or come up with the original idea. I‚Äôm just thinking I‚Äôm a good story teller and writer and a troll in a way. The pen is mightier than the sword as they say! Furthermore, (my insanity) I was thinking that I helped create or owned part of incite from the TV show ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm _PERSON_ but that incite was bought out by Intel in a past life and we live in a computer simulation. That or AMD. It‚Äôs one of the two, but if I had to guess it would be Intel. I would say 99.999% of the time I suffered a miserable short life, bu
t sometimes I was rich like a multi-millionaire. I was worth a few million dollars in a parallel universe, which I don‚Äôt have anymore. I‚Äôm chronically poor, fat, and feel suicidal sometimes because of how my life turned out. It never ends. My biggest fear again is waking up in 2011 again as a paranoid schizophrenic and living life over again like reality or my brain resets back to that date exactly as I was. I always talk about _NAME_ because I was convinced I was him and that I would some how get some sympathy and some money because I‚Äôm poor and suffering and I helped the world and some people. Unfortunately, my plan did not work and I am giving up. I‚Äôve been in constant fear because I‚Äôve heard one blogger say people hate him and want to tar and feather him. Stuff like that scares the ???? out of me. I‚Äôm very naive, scared, and innocent. I‚Äôm on the autistic specturm and have schizophrenia. I guess I was desperate for money because I thought I was wronged, suffered, and was given schizophrenia. 
I rather not be believed than believed. I have to move on. My doctor thinks I‚Äôm crazy as well as my family and everyone here and even on every other website. I just want safety for me and my family. My family thinks I‚Äôm delusional and is tired of hearing about me. My family is #1 to me and I love them dearly. I just worry about there safety and my safety by talking about my schizophrenia and thoughts on this website, youtube, twitter, and my blog (former blog), and possibly if anything real happened to me in college (I have no memory what-so-ever). I believe everything is my fault and if something happened to them, I would blame myself. I think I was given $200ish million dollars in a past life. Was it because I was part of the Bitcoin creator team? Probably not. I had a hellish and a hard life measured in the billions. I had my mind uploaded to a computer and I think I‚Äôm semi-immortal living in a video game. I have zero memory of anything bitcoin related at all. It‚Äôs just a stupid schizo thought I ha
d today. I mean if I could have pulled off the _NAME_ stuff in a past life, why not Bitcoin? Maybe it was created in a parallel universe or outside the simulation and given to humanity. I don‚Äôt know. I have a lot of strange delusional thoughts. Maybe I‚Äôve always been schizo in every damn life I‚Äôve ever had. These are just random thoughts. I could add more of my nonsense and schizophrenia but I‚Äôll end here. Thank you and have a nice day!"

I get stressed but I keep applying and looking for work I don‚Äôt want to give up I know there‚Äôs plenty of jobs I could do and I hope my next pays decent like the hotel and isn‚Äôt too stressful.

If you can hear traffic then your not in the earth enough. I know it sounds weird but its the only truly quiet place ive found. The only place where ive been able to get quiet on my own accord.

176094940,I understand your wish to stay healthy it can be done if walking gets boring do another form of exercise when you find something you will get enjoyment from
176094941,That‚Äôs so funny!

176094949,I did that to walls and mirrors when I was unmedicated.
176094950,I do not want to turn this thread to the religious discussion. I do not know why _PERSON_ went to the mental institution. 20 years ago I bought and read his book ‚ÄòThus Spoke Zarathustra‚Äô and I liked it. Somehow I understood that there is a continuous battle between good and evil in the same way as people may feel positive and negative (depressed). Even atheists may have their own belief system. During many years I have noticed that very little triggers can trigger major depressive processes in my mind.
174366172,"I am on Latuda 80mg which works best for me. It only works for positive symptoms. 120mg made me sleepy and 160mg caused Akathisia, resltless movement disorder.

I am thinking about trying it."

I give a fair portion of my budget to charitable causes. I like Doctors without Borders. I‚Äôve probably given the most to the Red Cross for hurricane relief. They said the Red Cross built only six permanent shelters for earthquake victims in Haiti, but I think they built quite a bit of decent temporary shelter. I‚Äôm not saying you have to do this. Just find something that moves you, and do something. Maybe you could volunteer to stuff envelopes for a cause. My personal situation allows me to donate my excess money. I‚Äôm very careful how I spend my money, so I usually have some left over. It makes me feel good to help people in need. There is no shortage of worthy causes. Maybe you could volunteer at the local animal shelter, if you like animals."

176094964,Try hard to not screw up your thinking by putting too much meaning into the bumps and squeaks. It will make you crazy otherwise. It‚Äôs hard to turn that crazy ‚Äúconnect-the-dots‚Äù mentality off when there‚Äôs a lot of brain inflammation though.
174366170,"I have had rounded shoulders and I slouch a lot. I‚Äôve always stuck out like a sore thumb. When I‚Äôm in good physical condition, I don‚Äôt look too bad, I‚Äôd get more positive attention. Now that I‚Äôve had the diagnosis for a few years I realize that with my weight I definitely do stick out like a sore thumb. Sometimes people assume I‚Äôm a little slow. I don‚Äôt get more negative attention. People laugh at me and stuff. It‚Äôs usually younger folks. Older people tend to be more kind to me around here at least. I don‚Äôt know what deficit schizophrenia is and I don‚Äôt know for sure that there is a ‚Äúschizophrenic‚Äù look. It would not surprise me.

176094985,Thank you very much. Staying in the relationship has caused me to go in the hospital 4 or 5 times in the past year. I just cant do it anymore. And staying with family I have started to see glimpses of my old self which is refreshing. I know it‚Äôs going to be rough. But for right now we are going to completely separate and then later on divorce when I can financially afford it.
176094986,Is this the boyfriend tripping on LSD? Seriously. You exhibit totally delusional thought and it seems the only person you have in your corner is tripping.

176094988,I was not overly keen on sharing rooms either and one girl was abusing me and ranting how I had wronged her. One girl threw water in my face because I sat on ‚Äúher seat‚Äù where she said she always sits. One guy got in a fiat fight with a male nurse and another nurse pushed me to safety. I have been to psychiatric hospital in Sweden and in Australia. I believe in rehabilitation but they should not get away with murder. Maybe a special centre for criminal psychotic people so they don‚Äôt mix with peaceful psychotic people. God knows what reality they have and what they believe etc Even if they thought it was self defence it‚Äôs still murder and hurting someone. They have probably suffered enough and might feel tortured by voices and delusions but they may be a danger to the public and the public may need protection from these people. In Sweden the people were angry because prison food was better than hospital food and school food. They didn‚Äôt like that. I gave a guy a blowjob in prison once when I 
was psychotic.lol I think it‚Äôs good to give sexual criminals medication to take away their sex drive and make them a sexual for many years or forever depending on the crime. Sometimes I have heard of murderers that I don‚Äôt think get enough years . I do believe in good prisons and hospitals. Those prisons you see on tv and movies are awful and I don‚Äôt think anyone can be rehabilitated in awful environment. I don‚Äôt believe in death penalty or eye for eye but I do believe in proper time to be done and rehabilitation. Often to little time is given and change and improvements may not occur in such short time.
176094989,"Hey everyone. So this isn‚Äôt really new it has just become more pronounced I guess. When I am handling smaller parts and manipulating things that require more steady hands I have noticed they waver a lot and I can‚Äôt really change it to make them steady. It also happened a few days ago when I was just holding my phone to show someone a picture, I had trouble keeping it still. It happens every day when I lean in to take a bite of lunch when I lean forward my neck and head shakes back and forth like many vibrations.

174366174,Is anyone here in college or have a degree? I dropped out when I was 19 then went back to college after I went ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù a little over 2 years ago. It was soon after I got a DUI in 2017. Going back to college has been a struggle I get really paranoid and anxious. I have really ?????? up delusions about the FBI being after me and putting people in munch classes to keep tabs on me. I try to remind myself these are delusions but it keeps happening even when I‚Äôm on medication. I only have 8 classes left until I get my associates in psychology. After that I will transfer to a university and hopefully get my masters. I am on Wellbutrin for depression and adhd Lyrica for anxiety and Zyprexa for my delusions. The medications help but it‚Äôs really hard. I feel like no one understands and I isolate myself because I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm going to be psychotic. It‚Äôs hard to make plans when I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be same that day my friend wants to hang out next weekend and I haven‚Äôt seen him in awh

Anyway he started staring at me back and I glanced at him and I would look away and this happened loads of times. With him looking away at times also. There was also a time when he seemed to take a picture of me with his phone and laughed with his freind towards me (well, he didn‚Äôt stare at me directly but it felt like it) anyway it‚Äôs gonna be tense now because he will think I want to fight him or something which I don‚Äôt want.

176095128,"Alas, my experience, much like yours, is that psychiatrists often disregard the criterion of rigid conviction, sometimes even when the content of the belief is entirely plausible. Eg. I have mentioned a person I‚Äôve met, and communicated with, in life (though on the Internet) and said she is a psychoanalyst. They have suggested this is a delusion! Also, I have revealed that I have attempted and experimented with telepathy (including with the psychoanalyst) and they have concluded I have some kind of delusional belief in telepathy. I have even emphasised that my telepathy attempts seemed to be unsuccessful. I have also emphasised that I have no proof of either the name of the psychoanalyst, nor that she is indeed a psychoanalyst. -A."

I distance myself from crowd where I‚Äôd have panic attacks. But having this disability, made me also open my eyes to the people around me. It made me see who were true and honest to me.

176095132,"If you drink and take your meds you could die.

176095149,Who is the he who died?
174366212,"I have read a lot about the negative and cognitive symptoms in SZ. No currently medication are approved for the treatment of that domain of symptomatology. Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor agonists or partial agonist are under investigation at the time I am writing this, but the results found are far to be conclusive and in any case difficult to maintain due to receptor sensitization and tachyphylaxis. NMDAR co-agonists, Ampakines, could theoretically help with the NMDA dysfunction, that is suspected to be the primary cause of the main SZ syndrome. Ampakines have lack of results. Many other RCT‚Äôs have been conducted, including those with the co-agonists D-serine, Glicine and the glycine reuptake inhibitor Sarcosine. Many _NAME_-analysis and reviews have been done, yielding yet conflicting results. Some found sarcosine to be effective as regarding negative symptoms but no cognitive. This is the more recent _NAME_-analysis I have been found. (copy and paste the link without the dot: .pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/30730250/) The authors conclude: ‚ÄúOur _NAME_-analysis revealed no significant effect of NMDA-enhancing agents on overall cognition. However, subgroup analysis suggested that NMDAR-enhancing agents may benefit young patients with schizophrenia, and NAC may have an effect on working memory. Additional trials with larger samples are suggested to evaluate these cognitive domains and ascertain the possible mechanisms.‚Äù So, at this point, we don‚Äôt know what to expect. I have been reading personal experiences taking sarcosine in this forum but I fail to draw a conclusion: some of you have worsen your overall symptoms while others find some mild effects on your negative domain even cognition. So my question is simple: At this point, would you recommend taking sarcosine? Do you have any RCT supporting the positive synergic action of sarcosine + NAC? If the answer is yes, what dose is more appropriate? I am deciding whether to take sarcosine + NAC or not, and the fundamental cons I found is that: 1) Its so ex
pensive for me, as 3 months of profrontal (Sarcosine + NAC) costs 135$. 2) I am afraid of worsening my symptoms. I read some bad reviews in other threads in this forum."

After I had a cyst removed my chest, we had a followup visit. She left me sitting in an empty room for 45 minutes while she was on her computer right across the hall. There‚Äôs a back story to that, but basically she was seeing if I would go off like a rocket.

176095159,Why was this brought back?
176095160,Yeah my voices say I‚Äôm going to hell forever and torture my body saying thats just a small sample of hell but I stopped believing in them they never gave me proof that they are God or have the power to send me to hell their just all talk. I tell them to prove it and they tell me they don‚Äôt have to prove any thing to me and tell me to listen to them but then I say I don‚Äôt have to do any thing for them. They mostly make smart remarks and give me feelings to prove their points and lol at ever little thing I do cuz I can‚Äôt do their test or do something a certain way they to do. So I don‚Äôt think your going to hell my voices say that I‚Äôm the weakest being that they have tested ever and say I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs going to hell but like I said there‚Äôs no proof to this iv always beat people at video games and competitions and finished high school so I‚Äôm pretty sure that they have the wrong being and they there is some one weaker out there than me. They say that I‚Äôm weak for not being a
ble to quit cigarettes but there‚Äôs loads of people out there that die from it and couldn‚Äôt quit so iam not sure what the voices are getting at. They just made me deaf in one ear while writing this to send a message that they are God and the illuminati but I say who cares there not the boss of me and they never really gave me a chance with there test just really bad cravings/thoughts for cigs and said that‚Äôs all that mattered but I can‚Äôt quit they just torment me day and night about hell and how I am never gonna see the day of light again and how they are gonna rape me feed me to dogs and subject me to infinite pain and being uncomfortable. They say that I am gonna pay for every bit of pleasure that iv had on this earth and say thats y the illuminati symbol is on the dollar cuz ever one pays and how the word pain sounds like pay. But like I said your not going to hell my voices say that its just me thats going and ever one else is in heaven and my family doesn‚Äôt exist any more and the ones I see are 
just clones. They swear that most people listen to them and I‚Äôm the only one that didn‚Äôt so I failed the test I tell them that I don‚Äôt want any thing to do with their test but they keep testing me and giving me feelings while I try to ignore them i even tell them what they want and they just say death so there‚Äôs no reasoning with them they never gave me a chance

174366248,"Read my previous posts carefully and take your time to think about it. If you recollect unmedicated life and are now on meds then you need to readdress your psychosis. Not simple that ‚ÄúI was violent‚Äù, but rather why was I violent? What drove me to rage as a trigger? What were the racing thoughts that drove me to violence? If you just say schizophrenia as the all time, all answers fit here, although the precursor was a terrible childhood in a war zone then you are not really delving enough. Not all schizophrenics are violent and have kill commands, but a number have terrible self worth and are being punished by their own subconscious for that and the voices are reflected in that. Change your mindset and change your life."
176095304,it bothers me terribly when people who hate me purposely make me aggravated and angry. i have a super at work who (before covid-19) would run me down with anger all day long. these kind of people are trying hard to give me psychosis and a breakdown. it is extremely hard to ignore and even harder not to feel angry from all this. i haven‚Äôt gotten very far with working this out. anybody else have such problems? _NAME_
