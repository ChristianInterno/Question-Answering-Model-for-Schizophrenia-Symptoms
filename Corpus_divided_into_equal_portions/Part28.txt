Give up smoking first IMHO. The rewards are infinite from being less smelly, breathing better to exercise with, taste becomes better. It is shorter to do and will pay off tremendously. Get some gum, boiled sweets and a fidget spinner to occupy the hands. Don’t just sit there and let the cravings overtake you, get up and go for walks etc. Buena suerte con su viaje."

176208152,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_
176208153,My psychiatrist said I could take one since I told her about the side effects it caused me. And I am able to work and do ‘normal’ stuff and have relationships with people. When I’m working I don’t hear anything at all even on breaks.

176208155,Sorry for your loss.
176208156,No and I don’t do drugs either.
176208157,Most people who have it have often had a very stressful event right before having a severe break. But that doesn’t mean that they didn’t have the genetics for it. Like I’m pretty sure my brother could have it but never had a breakdown. Would not wish it on anyone. It’s also how you cope/respond to things sometimes. My brother is successful now he’s doing advertising at a major company in the city and I’m so happy for him. He doesn’t smoke weed. He’s very responsible. He stopped smoking in college when he decided it didn’t help him. He also stopped smoking cigarettes. So if you eliminate these three factors: severe stress/how you handle the stress/stop smoking cigarettes/don’t smoke weed you might help prevent it from becoming worse or even happening in the first place. For me it was high stress and just not knowing my limits. But its also genetic. My mom never got treatment for years until she was about fifty and couldn’t manage it without help.
176208158,I recommend the _NAME_ Method or _NAME_ Recipe for withdrawal.

176208178,"On a good day (decent), I was in Project Moonshadow as a space marine in SSP. On a bad day, I went through Monarch Programming and Montauk Project. Apparently nothing happened but I remember stuff like I remember going home in later 2011. I think I went to Mars for a bit. I also think I saw aliens and woke up during the soul transfer process into the cloned body and fought them. I remember being taken from my room at the cooperative and then waking up back home (in the cooperative)-- allegedly 20+ years later. It seems like I’m in an infinite loop and this has been going on for eternity like Edge of Tomorrow. I will never go back that is my choice and I feel like my life was destroyed on purpose as I was taken against my will and ended up with schizophrenia for eternity. Every life is about the same. I also get weird dreams like I’m a MiLab or Super Soldier sort of like Inception. Been going on my whole life in the universe. Basically I got taken to mars in 2011 and then came home not knowing w
hat “is” real and then became super dissociative and schizophrenic. Then I feel like they ‘updated’ the software or matrix and now for the past billion lifetimes I’m stuck or wake up around 2013 some random place without a consciousness up until that point. Basically I wake up and resume my life in 2013 without being born or not existing before 2013. Makes me think something happened or what not. I also have paranoid delusions that I was _NAME_ and _USER_ID_ in a past life/parallel universe a long time ago. I get scared. Basically that sums up my life and everything about me and my delusions. I’ve been fighting these demons and insanity and by putting this online I risk my life every day – I think. The Mars thing is a dream but it’s mostly that and it’s short. I think it’s real though. I think they gave me trauma or schizophrenia on purpose for waking up, posting stuff on facebook like “we live in the matrix” or “I was the guy running your simulation” and stuff like that. Basically 
I’ve had acute schizophrenia for 9 years and I hope I get cured some day. Whether it’s by aliens, God, or the norovirus vaccine. Then I wake up, back in time, and do this all over again since 2013. I even escaped the matrix. It was very traumatic going to Mars. I often wonder if it was about a woman or powerful individuals and groups of people hating me. I posted a lot of crap on the internet back then and it could be nothing or different timelines so it’s sort of random or at best pointless information. I’ve read into this SSP thing and aliens and conspiracy crap and there’s a lot of stuff known about it but I guess that’s it."

Ive found that in a lot of jobs I wasn’t the right fit or maybe I didn’t like my co-workers or I didn’t like some aspect of it. And I got fired or walked out. But then I find jobs that I liked and succeed at. I call this “finding my niche” jobs. Jobs where everything comes together and the work isn’t too difficult, my co-workers are OK, it pays OK, it’s a good atmosphere etc. Those jobs are offered on Craigslist or online somewhere or a newspaper and they look like any other job advertised. But if you get lucky (sometimes you make your own luck) you stumble on some job that is a “niche job”, one of those jobs where it’s comfortable and you fit. It’s why you or me or other people shouldn’t give up. I’m late for work but employment agencies are excel
lent for finding jobs like that. They might test you to see where your strengths lie or what you’re best suited for. And if you find the right agency they will help find a good match for you. Most of them work with companies and kind of have a partnership with them so they can tell you a lot of info about various employers. There’s even employment agencies that deal exclusively with disabled people, and even more specifically with the mentally ill. I’ve gotten several jobs that way."

Love is downplayed in it’s importance and more objective measures dominate. Like sexual occurrences or socio-economic standing are more important.

176208365,"I went through the same thing for a long time. I developed narcolepsy when I was 15 but didn’t receive a diagnosis or treatment until I was 21. For those 6 years I struggled hugely with functioning and felt so frustrated, I knew something was wrong but didn’t know what, and I had to go to a bunch of different doctors and get all these tests run. But in the end they finally figured out what it was and it turned my life around getting treated for it. So hang in there and don’t stop fighting until you find what is going on with you."
174395833,"I lived alone for one of my two delusional years. I had roommates but we didn’t really talk to one another. My mom visited fairly often and took me into Crisis Care every few months when I was having a breakdown. I think they just couldn’t handle my constant delusions and living with them. It’s quite a miracle I recovered from them to the point where I can live with family again without putting any undue strain on them. I highly prefer it. I still have memories of 8 years ago before I got sick when I was driving around town at night with a button down and some nice slacks grabbing some late night groceries or picking up someone to see a film with. I kind of went from adult back to child and am now climbing my way back up to functioning adult. It sucks but I’m doing pretty well all things considered I guess. TLDR: It’s better to live with other people when you have schizoaffective disorder, if they can handle it."
176208366,"prob that APs yea, it’s nice that you feel a difference. How long since the increase?"
176208367,"I might get nicotine gum or snus m,I prefer snus because they are very easy to hide.I felt like if I take the medicine I am more tired,I needed things to stimulate me so that I can do stuff"
176208368,I didn’t have dreams about marriage and children. I developed them after I met this one man.
176208369,Every body deserves love
176208370,"Thanx!. For The Insight _AT_MENTION_. Your Post Has Filled My Heart With Incomprehensible Joy. Like A Gentle Stream Of Endless Beauty & Hope!. Are You A Fairy?. Sincerely, DJ _PERSON_ Beat _PERSON_ (sleepoptimistic) Ps. _NAME_ Is A Great Artist!."
176208371,"I don’t think cutting out dairy is healthy for anyone who isn’t allergic or lactose intolerant. I’m lactose intolerant, but I usually just take some lactaid"
176208372,Low dose. Overmedication is awful.
174395826,well what the problem then lol just take abilify again. conquer the addiction/compulsion issues with cbt. bam you got it in the bag
176208373,I should cook more. But many times I dont feel like going to all the work. So I just snack around or eat out. Will try to cook tomorrow
174395830,"It’s possible, Abilify made me super anxious. Once I got off of it I was very calm. Could be the Abilify _AT_MENTION_"
176208374,I think you can go to a therapist at 70€ per hour twice a week and they will cure you the day after your dead. It’s a waste of money for psychosis imo.
176208375,"_AT_MENTION_ LOL! I could, but you must be aware that my muscular dystrophy also affects my thighs…so lifting my butt to go up would cause major pelvic injury. But thanks for suggesting! _AT_MENTION_ So I talked to the psychiatrist and he was so kind enough to do a 30 minute phone call when my mom arrived at the psych office. He talked to me about a bunch of things, checked upon my hypomania, and promised me to continue phone calls in the future. I am so thankful that he is so understanding. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Yes, it should be accommodating. However, Korea does not have laws for that. We even have an eugenic law that allows discrimination against those with congenital disabilities. I myself have a late-onset form of congenital muscular dystrophy. It’s a fight between the disabled and the healthy here. No one is listening to our thoughts and they just do whatever is good for them."
176208376,"I don’t. I get anxiety, but I don’t seem to have more of it than the people I work with and I deal with it effectively. I have SZ and Asperger’s Syndrome."
176208377,Community flags? What the heck that mean hatred? Can I do a flag for hatred?
176208378,It’s even more stressful when your waiting for everything to go through the solicitors. And then the actually moving in when ya get the keys. I just moved into my own house about a month ago.
176208379,Good for you _AT_MENTION_!
176208380,I don’t know how people stay happy for such long periods. Relationships are ups and downs. My partner is so happy with me. He doesn’t want a lot from life. That’s why. He’s satisfied. Have you considered talking with the woman?
176208381,I want to work as a vet assistant since I studied to become one but I dont mind other jobs.
176208382,I don’t know the answers my friend
176208383,Welcome to the forum I don’t take vraylar but 2 days is to early to tell how it’s affecting you.
176208384,I have pretty high self esteem and always have. I attribute it to a good childhood and getting into therapy early. Learned lots of self affirmations that I repeated in the mirror.
176208385,"Ok, so you got write-ups. That’s basically to tell you that you need to improve. So do that. Try your best to not miss any more work unless it’s absolutely necessary. Learn from the mistakes you’ve made with your meds so you don’t fall asleep at work again. And try to keep your anxiety under control so you don’t have another panic attack. All you can do is try to take the advice that they are giving you and try to improve. You can do it. You can keep this job. I believe in you."
176208386,To 300-400mg if I want to get rid of the shot
176208387,"Sleep apnea can cause hallucinations because of poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation effects. As far as I know, it can’t cause paranoia or delusions."
176208388,I’m not looking forward to tonight sure i’m not going to sleep well.
176208389,Well topamax is often called dopamax for a reason. It is famous for causing cognitive impairment(poor concentration/memory/language/speech problems etc)
176208390,"I appreciate your cordial response. I wasn’t always certain of every bizarre thing that my psychotic brain thought up when I was psychotic either, I nonetheless was delusional. It’s good you have some insight but these ideas of thinking your Christ are right out of the Psychotic handbook. I remember once you were waffling with the idea that other people were demons too. and you were scared. Another definite Psychotic symptom. I wish you luck anyway. I hope you will consider meds and/or counseling as they do work for most people."
176208391,I like _PERSON_. It’s really good.
174395841,Forget beta alanine. _AT_MENTION_ is using L-carnosine directly. He’s also on respiridal.
176208392,I don’t like hating her memory but she’s on my mind every morning. Mothers are hard to foget.
176208393,"I thought if we ever organized an SZ.com party, me and _AT_MENTION_ could emcee… _AT_MENTION_ could drop the music beats… and _AT_MENTION_ would do the catering!"
176208394,Be kind but not a doormat and get out as much as possible
176208395,"Tbh, you get the same answers and still say the same thing. That’s why you get closed threads. So please keep it to this one."
176208396,"Thank you _PERSON_, yes I do it myself. Juxtaposition is what it’s called, the layering of images to create a new image meaning. I use various painting apps too."
176208397,"Today I felt _PERSON_ was talking to me and she was upset at me I don’t know what I said. There is a small rumor going around that people want me dead, and she said that they should gag me first. If there wasn’t a rumor going around I doubt she would have said that."
176208398,"That’s a couple days in between calls. It’s kind of a judgement call whether to call this soon or wait until Monday. She kinda owes you an explanation of why she didn’t do as she was supposed to do. TBH, it’s a little bit of a bad sign that she did that. It’s a little unprofessional that she did what she did without an explanation. I would call her and politely ask about the drug test form. As long as you’re not calling every day, several times a day I think a quick phone call wouldn""t hurt. I mean getting hired is serious business and she should not leave anybody hanging."
176208399,"Sorry to hear that, _AT_MENTION_. Let’s both wait a little longer"
176208400,I almost ended up in jail during my last bit of psychosis. I was driving around with a fully loaded gun. I got pulled over for flying through a red light. Luckily my windows were tinted so the cop didn’t see. I was driving around with a gun because I thought Asian people were aliens and I was getting ready to start wiping them out. But yes. Mental health in the US is awful. There is nowhere for us to go. No system to help us. Just a hospital for a few days depending insurance. Thanks god the meds help me. I feel bad for those who can’t get it.
176208401,Physical torture?
176208402,yes - i have had that occasionsally for years on clopixol… i don’t really think about it much i am sure i do it a lot still without thinking
176208403,"Also I was fat before the quarantine, now I am obese lol"
176208404,_AT_MENTION_ where you been?
176208405,"_AT_MENTION_ mine used to comment on peoples physical health and i used to believe it was true. itd be like ‘oh yeah that lady, overweight , diabetes , heart arrythimia, clogged arteries, 18 years to live’ something like that. just instantaneous comments."
176208406,You’re good man I don’t think anyone’s judging you for it.
176208407,So smell hallucinations? I get them sometimes but not a ton i dont think. Theyre harder to reality test
174395838,"Things just feel more overwhelming, Ive got a shorter attention span and I can’t excercise how I used to"
176208408,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ that’s a really good article. I have no idea how high it is, but I guess I will find out when I see the doctor."
176208409,I managed to get the shopping done today. But it’s okay that you didn’t. Thank God for _PERSON_. Maybe next time you can do just a little more then the next a little more and so on.
176208410,_AT_MENTION_ thanks… I hope it continues to work too… I actually read about this piercing before going to get it I also asked the artist about it and they agreed it should help in short term and long term… They said changing to a hoop should help even more than just getting it done _AT_MENTION_ thank you! I just hope it continues to work
176208411,"I guess, what I’m dealing with is not just the loss of a mother, but also the potential for the loss of all of human civilization. I know, I can’t control it, but I’m frightened nonetheless. I’m trying to have a life for myself, but it seems some of the people I meet want to make me their “special project”. You try to have realistic expectations for yourself, but these people think I should go for more than I’m capable of. They make me angry, and I know I shouldn’t care. It’s just so hard to keep going in the face of it all. Do you know what I mean?"
176208412,This year’s resolution was to not have any resolutions. #whalefail
176208413,Lol. I was flagged once before. I called “all therapists” morons (someone’s therapist was advising them to come off meds). So I should have been more narrow in my criticism I guess. I think currently there’s a bug whereby it only takes one flag to trigger the system into hiding the post. But yeah ! I’m a double bad boy now !

176208422,My sister wouldn’t lend me $3500 to get a new used car with because my old one is standing on it’s last leg. My sister and brother-in-law are loaded with money. I was looking into buying a used car from my boss whom I know. It was donated to Wolfe Street Foundation which supplies AA and AlAnon meeting facilities. Wolfe Street is a charitable not for profit organization. I volunteer there. My sister had me feeling so bad I was thinking of killing myself. I’m cutting it off with my sister and brother-in-law for the time being.
176208423,"I took a medication called Latuda, it made me start talking to myself. It got pretty bad. Right now I’m doing a lot better and today with Clonazepam I am barely having any racing thoughts to talk to myself. I feel so embarrassed by it."

176208431,Thank you for sharing your story and I am very sorry you have suffered so much in your past. I am very impressed by your English lanuage skills. You will find your way out.
176208432,I am what is referred to as the host. I am probably the closest to being the “original” but even I don’t know if I am the “original” As for therapy it’s basic talk therapy/ trauma work.

176208434,"My feet are killing me from pacing all day. Latuda, haldol, risperdal, and now perphenazine all make me pace my house and I can’t stop my feet are aching really bad because I don’t have carpet. I’ve tried benztropine, artane, propranolol and now vistaril for the pacing any ideas? I really should have stuck to the initial zyprexa I was on but the eating and hunger cravings had be banging my head against the fridge."
176208435,The bottom line is this is written about my fears of how powerful governments are getting in controlling our lives because of the virus and where it may eventually lead.

It seems to be dangerous enough to write this as it is so if you want it scrubbed because I violated your work or someone else’s then I’m all in favor of it. Thank you.

I sent him a pretty abrupt message on WhatsApp yesterday telling him not to contact my building materials supplier directly, and he was going to have a go at them for 5% wastage on bricks, which I had already told him was normal. He never listens to my opinion, and he undermines me all the time. I have had enough of it to be honest. I am due to go on holiday with my parents and this guy in 6 weeks, and I don’t want to ruin that holiday. It’s getting close to me snapping at him if he starts telling me what to do on my job based on his research on his iPad I am literally going to have him for it. All I hear from him is the opinions of other people, and I am sick of it. The guy needs to see a professional, as he is definitely suffering from OCD or something like that. The way he behaves is not cool"

I still have my paranoia, but I should work on this with other methods, cause regarding my situation from the bad past 20 years, there wont be a med who will make me recover on 100%… Well, for the negatives, its not the best either but this is a small issue… One pdoc told me, that in his opinion, its the best ap ever.

And like I feel bad because I want to help her and I dont want to just abandon her but she’s just too much And I really hate to doubt her but it’s just so suspicious like just with how she behaves too. It definitely feels like exaggerating and almost like a “I have it too and I also have it worse” thing. And it bothers me that she won’t even tell her doctors about these things. She’s just says “they dont listen” “I’m too broken” “I’m never gonna get better” And its like at least try for ????? sake Like I keep telling them they need to get assistance for these things I can only do so much.

176208486,"We are in a controlled thought experiment done by higher up elites and government people to examine the building of civilization more in depth. There is many players, such as Universities and rogue research groups, doing experimentation on people predisposed to mental illness to see the effects of being targeted for imagined crimes. They break the person down into a programmable person that will have to go through certain things, such as psychiatry and therapy, to see how it affects the person in question. That is how my targeting started about 2 years ago and i’ve had to go through the system many times, even go into a psych ward, just because no one believes me that the shadow government has neuroweapons at their disposal to drive targets insane. The tech we are allowed to have is about a few generations behind what the underground research facilities have and many of us are monitored by people doing research. Also, i believe aliens walk among us and the government exchanges humans for alien te
ch. The government also has a secret branch of Xmen at their disposal that can do things like telekinesis and remote viewing. They have been training army soldiers into psychic soldiers and will be used in the upcoming space war that has been predicted.

I had a group of children that kept pushing me around, spitting on me, until one day where i finally had it. I turned around, grabbed one, put him against the wall and started shouting at him. Then the bullying stopped but many people were calling me a satanist, crazy (i already was showing signs of mental illness at the time) or dangerous, just because of the music i listened to and the t-shirts of bands i wore.

Most recently(3 yrs. ago)I got terribly depressed, but it just was not like the same depression I had suffered for years, and I had other symptoms consistent with low thyroid. It took 2 years for my primary to refer me to an endocrinologist and that was only because I insisted on getting that referral. And, yes, I had low thyroid and take a med that has helped in many ways including getting rid of the depression.

Delusions of alien control, or passivity experiences, are symptoms associated with schizophrenia in which patients misattribute self-generated actions to an external source. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Delusions of alien control in the normal brain. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and CD _PERSON_, Neuropsychologia , 2003 Delusions of alien control, or passivity experiences, are symptoms associated with schizophrenia in which patients misattribute self-generated actions to an external source. In this study hypnosis was used to induce a similar misattribution of self-generated movement in normal, healthy individuals. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was employed to investigate the neural correlates of active movements correctly attributed to the self, compared with identical active movements misattributed to an external source. Active movements attributed to an external source resulted in significantly higher activations in the parietal cortex and cere
bellum than identical active movements correctly attributed to the self. We suggest that, as a result of hypnotic suggestion, the functioning of this cerebellar-parietal network is altered so that self-produced actions are experienced as being external. These results have implications for the brain mechanisms underlying delusions of control, which may be associated with overactivation of the cerebellar-parietal network."

176208610,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ ! Really glad you liked it
176208611,"I’m not going to argue with you about it. Your original post does not make sense to being addicted to caffeine in soda. Say what you mean. Change your word from coke to soda or pop, depending where you are from. And stop sniffing your soda."

174395891,"I wonder if there are mutations in the DISC1 gene in me- that’s Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 gene, one of the genes that are thought to cause schizophrenia. I would have to do whole genome sequencing to find out. I just did basic neuromuscular panel for my genetic disease. I just know a lot because I wanted to know more about my genetic mutations."
174395903,My cousin had schizophrenia. He’s dead now and was younger than me. He shot himself while cleaning a gum. Some think he committed suicide. He was off meds when he died.
176208614,Me too 7i8u8i8i
176208615,Yeah I remember a fair bit of them. Looking back now I know that when I am gettinf unwell if I get this overwhelming sense that something is going on that I can’t quite put my finger on. Like everyone is in on some kind of major world wide conspiracy and I’m in the middle of it all. I remember thinking at one point that the psych ward I was staying at was secretly a space station half underground. The plan was to save the gifted people on it when the world gets destroyed.
174395894,I drink caffeine a lot too. What I look forward to. The only thing that is weird is my sister doesn’t do much either. Does she have negative symptoms because of me?
176208616,I finally found a good pdoc and shes leaving end of this month… Sux ass !! I dont want to even see someone else !! Over it !

176208620,"I see a pdoc, a gp doc every 2 weeks for my injection and i see a mobile team worker every 4 weeks now. No therapist."
176208621,nah i hate my life.
176208622,"That’s a good idea. I could use a mentor. Have you heard the term flooding? A therapist once suggested it, to just place oneself in the very situation s/he is avoiding. I’ve never been good with social cues, otherwise I’d be out there shaking my tail feather."
176208623,Glad it went well may God bless your daughter now and forever and give her good health
176208624,That sounds like a good celebration!

176208635,Glad you are ok. Seroquel caused restless legs.
174395896,"Nah, I think the meds are okay. Aripiprazole or abilify , has a profile which I personally picked myself. I wouldn’t really change it, and my use of _NAME_ is so spontaneous that it’s hard to justify that meds can cause tiredness In my case. But that’s a different situation altogether. As above, I work three days and study four. It really is, just a case of overworking."
176208636,"I’m from England. its only a very small proportion of people with SZA/SZ who get ongoing support from social services. Most people only have temporary support. I’m under the intellectual disability service, I get 31 hours a week one-to-one funding a week. This means I can employ a support worker so I can be independent. Online I only know of a few people with mental health difficulties that get funding from social services. With finances again its only small number of people who lack capacity. I lack capacity according to a psychologist so social services manage my finances."
176208637,"This is like telling my genetic disorder- which I had since I was 20 years old- that it could have been prevented through “right choices”. No, it’s in my genes…I’ve had it since birth. This is same with schizophrenia. It’s an illness that cannot be prevented. There’s no vaccine nor a medicine that helps you to not get sick."
176208638,"What have I done in my past life To deserve something so painful? How can I understand the work of Heavens When my muscles are turning to dust? Slowly, my mind and my body are turning against me; I sit here, helpless, screaming silently. My heart doesn’t want to go; My heart wants to stay still. But time is not endless, and it flows; My body will age, and so will my mind. As time goes, I will be poked with heated iron And my soul will rupture. It is inevitable. Death cannot be avoided. It is how it is; it’s life. Life is natural, and life must die and be born again. But my heart doesn’t want to go, at least not now. My heart doesn’t want to go, but time is mortal."

176208645,There used to be a joke about the mother who gave birth to a 9 pound ear. The point being that babies know what’s going on around them - until they get knocked out cold.

176208647,Can this happen because of Clonazepam?
176208648,wht kind of body sensations do you get?
176208649,I love snakes but stay away I guess. When I was living out bush I had red belly black snakes around my house and I jumped over a brown snake which was incredibly stupid and dangerous of me. It’s a miracle it didn’t bight me. I was sitting on a chair outside and it was in my way from leaving the chair so I jumped over it n the vibration should of made i bight me. Out in the country my x shot a brown snake in a tube and he made me hold the tube.ha ha ha ha ha My boyfriend was proud of me forthat. I live in Australia .

176208656,Have you checked your blood pressure?
176208657,"That’s great! I’m happy that you feel good Be cautious nonetheless and if you feel down again remember that you can feel happy again. To me it’s like a _USER_ID_, sometimes I feel great and a few days after I feel like crap. But enjoy it and have a great day"

176208659,"I""m so happy, I can’t stand it. What should I do?"
176208660,"At this time of change, I am even more prone to seeing conspiracies, not just government workers, but revolutionaries, who I’m emotionally attached to and want them to like me, I believe they are winning, but in truth revolution frightens me, as does all instability. I’ve got to get a grip on my own life, get back to my routine, stop worrying what other people think. Change is a part of life. My family on my fathers side were refugees from a racial war. Nothing scares me more, even though I long for justice. I keep trying to get involved to help, I worry that if I don’t there will be no future for me. Am I naïve to think the government is losing? I want things to get better, but I appreciate order in my life. I just want to get on with my life as if nothing is happening. Thank you."
176208661,I’m not sure how to make my profile private? I tried to follow _AT_MENTION_ instructions

176208664,"I fell asleep at about 6pm Saturday, and now I am awake from 3am Sunday. Going to be pretty tired later. Had to work Saturday morning, and then I saw my _PERSON_, went shopping. Once I rested I was really hungry, so I got a Dominos Pizza, which I had not had for ages. They were pretty expensive so I just got a small pizza meal deal for £13.99 Got an American Hot pizza, was nice. I like the dipping sauce they give you for the crusts at Dominos. Anyways, today I shall be taking it easy. I might build a piece of furniture, but not sure yet."

174395905,Without meds its a lot worse though and I become violent.
174395902,Would the Invega pill or Risperidone be cheaper?
176208671,"That’s hard when you don’t have that support. I can understand the temptation. It’s good you can go a week. That’s great progress. You can’t change your life immediately. It takes time. No one is going to judge you for that. As others suggested you can do AA so you can get some support. I would suggest going to a gym or take a walk outside, anything to help stop the boredom. The more active you are, the less you will feel like your only option is to drink."
176208672,"No, it didnt just go away just like that, it has been a long and arduous process of recovery, i was rediagnosed a few years ago which i believe was a good indicator that i have improved, My dr said he thought I had an underlying mixed personality disorder but i disagree, i am just me and maybe i am a bit weird but that doesnt mean its a disorder. _AT_MENTION_ yeah, i have been through all of that and its not nice but the important thing is you and not what other people think, you are more important. no-one should treat you badly, the illness is very similar to other ailments as it can be debilitating and affects our quality of life. meds have helped me a lot along the way but its about 50/50 with them, i was lucky to find a better med, i regret changing my original med at the start but luckily i went back on it after a number of years and things have got a lot better."

176208707,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

I thought maybe this is a universal type issue that evolves for us often…! Also relevant is my sleep prior did improve a couple smidges when I stopped taking the vitamin D supplements and multi-vitamin.

174395917,These question actually for my 16 years old son who is schizophrenic . He has both visual and auditory hallucinations. His psychartrist once prescribed him abilify but he refused to take it. I think he really afraid of side effects. I personally afraid of the med will do more harm than good. I am scared to dead myself. I don’t know what to do if he has bad reaction to it. I feel more safe if he put on seroquel because it cause less movement disorder but I also don’t want him to feel sedated all the time and gain weight. Abilify seems like a good choice for long run. Anyway my heart is broken that he has to take antipsychotic for the rest of his life.

176208733,"Ah, good point. I’ll have to find an alternative that won’t leave me hangry. I think I will go with a little fruit now and then instead. Don’t want the blood sugar to dip too low either. Also, I don’t think they help with blood sugar? but I really like to snack on a few nuts occasionally as well. Hurry up, date for appointment, lol. I have so many questions."
176208734,"That Is An Interesting Fact. A Little While Ago, I Spent Two Month’s Without One Bite. Nothing But Drinks. And!, No Alcohol. And One Day, My Case Manager & My Therapist Came Out To See Me. My Collarbones Were Slightly Exposed. And One Of The First Things My Case Manager Asked Was, ‘Are You Eating’?. My Therapist Laughed, And I Smiled And Said, ‘Not Much’. And Of Course My Case Manager Finished That Quick Mini Health Introduction, With, ‘You Need To Eat More’. And She Wasn’t Laughing. Which Makes Me Laugh Right Now. But!, I Might Check Into The Bahai’s Fasting Methods. To Be Honest I Hate Doing Anything Like Anyone Else. But!, Ancient Methods Are Still Here For A Reason. So There’s Always That.

176208735,"I just want to know if it will help bring back the clarity? Im sorry if thats a stupid question, coffee hasnt helped me as far as i know but i dont know about cigarettes, i promised my roommate i would quit and i dont remember how it felt at that time"
176208736,"_AT_MENTION_, according to online testing, I have no symptoms of depression or mania right now and haven’t had any for the past 15 years. I’d say I’ve been sleeping for about 10 to 12 hours a night like this for the past month or so. I don’t really know the answer to that question though I’m just guessing. My memory is not really that good."
176208737,On Latuda I was much better except for the occasional catatonia. I can handle its nausea with antinausea pills and I can handle the akathisia with Benzatropine.

176208738,Injections work for many. I think in this op’s case there’s good reasons for injections. You have to consider that in making these decisions.
176208739,"Yes I feel like that all the time, haven’t felt myself in a long time I don’t recognize myself I’m the mirror either it’s weird to feel so alienated from everything."
176208740,I have my insecurities about being a girl but overall. I’m content to be female. As opposed to male
176208741,I’ve always worn a ballcap. When I was about to get married my friend asked me what the biggest stress was for me about the whole event. I replied… “Finding a suit to match my hat” He thought that was so funny he mentioned it to me 20 years later. (I had forgotten I even said that)

176208746,When I was living in Singapore I got a job offer for NYC and Sydney. Decided to go to NY. Big mistake. That would have been my best shot at dodging psychosis.
176208747,They switched me from fluonxol to risperidone and heavily dosed me on 5mg. They also gave me phenegram and benzos. The earlier you book in and get treatment the shorter your stay
176208748,They are having me take clindamycin capsules 4 times a day for 7 days. Then I see the urologist again. I’ve had urinary pain for so long I’m actually used to it.
176208749,"I went through several with the county mental health services. A position with them was sort of a stepping stone for therapists who wanted to ultimately practice privately, so people would move on every couple of years and new people would replace them."
176208750,I chose McDo bcz we don’t have the others in Canada except for BurgerKing. There was a Wendys long time ago but I think it closed.
176208751,I take Klonopin twice a day.
176208752,"I’d look through the blinds, put on a scary mask, and give y’all a good jump scare."
176208753,Im reluctant to conclude my sz is genetic because nobody in my family has sz and my sz is a episodic illness. Well atleast the psychotic episodes are. So i wonder how if i have bad genes why they only cause sz sometimes like every two years on average. Sure genes control almost everything but i think environmental causes like stress or stimuli that cause brain activity cause me to over produce brain chemicals. I think my brain is damaged somehow.
176208754,Such a riddle can only be cracked by a real virtuoso maybe twice the genius _PERSON_ was.
176208755,I did the best i could to distract myself. It is just so hard when you’re in so much pain. Nothing really takes your mind away from how you’re feeling. Thanks for your support.
176208756,I am on Amisulpride and haloperidol at the moment but it’s just temporary
176208757,"Im not sure, but good luck! You are brave. I avoid dentists because even when nothing is wrong im scared. I think i would ask the psych what is best to combine with the anesthetic and for that situation."
176208758,Who are those people who want you to look aweful?
176208759,Take some comfort knowing it was only a hallucination. Make sure your doors and windows are locked or barricaded. You’re fine my friend
174395938,you can distance yourself from it. I did. if you dont want anything to do with it thats cool. i just take a very generalized view about it now.
176208760,nice HIIT weight training.
176208761,"yes, I just now realized she will keep me from chickening out."
176208762,I love my parents but they are difficult and complicated people to me. Not easy going in my opinion. They were atheists when they raised me and I would get in trouble if I prayed. My former stepmother also raised me. She did homework with me so I got good grades those couple years. I was not understood though. They didn’t understand how I suffered and I could not articulate that to them. It was bad when my mum took me back to Sweden first time and she said things like she wishes I was never born and I ruined her life etc I was also bullied. She had to drive two hours morning and night to get to and from work sometimes minus twenty and no heater in car and it often broke down cause it was old. Later she met my stepdad and he was abusive and she looked the other way and took his side. My brothers got better than me cause he was their dad. She always chose men and sex before me. I adore my mum and always will but I don’t think she’s easy going and she can have a bad temper in a scary way. My form
er stepmom was stable and still helps me. I’m renting my former stepmother apartment now.i could never afford the normal rent so she helps me out a lot. My mum is so admirable in so many ways and I love her so so much but no one has ever broken my heart as much as my mum has. I used to think my dad molested me now I think it was delusions not memory. I hope to have better relationship with my dad. He calls every couple of months. He let me take his last name again. I love them but it’s not easy easy relationship. We don’t talk every week or month even. My parents live far away. My mum lives in Sweden my dad interstate. I live close to my former stepmother and her children my step brother and sister. Love them all so so much though.

176208766,Yeah my doctor _NAME_ me hearing stuff from folk walking past might escalate if I didn’t take my meds/treatment. I was glad he did because I think left on my own things would have got bad. I became very suicidal with the external surveillance stuff
176208767,"No, these voices are from your brain."
176208768,I was drinking beer every night and a bunch of energy drinks like so so many last time plus I was t getting good sleep. Also I was completely of them every time now I take 5 mg and don’t plan on going lower

176208777,_AT_MENTION_ quote
174395944,I took fish oil for years on recommendation of my shrink. There were some good studies done years ago out here that suggested positive things for people with adhd so I gave it a go for negatives. I think I’m like you in that I didn’t really notice any change at all. These days I gave it up because it does have interactions with gout…and although I’m on allipuronal it bloody well hurts and I don’t want to bring that on.
176208778,saving for anything in particular?
176208779,Sometimes I just want to do something to change my situation and it’s usually very negative etc. I feel trapped.
176208780,Good luck _AT_MENTION_ . I never spent Christmas on a ward but I did spend Halloween in the psych Hospital in 2016. Very fitting.
176208781,"I have to go through my stuff in the garage that’s my college apartment stuff and see what I have and don’t have. My roommates took my glasses and my pans and I think a few other things from the kitchen when they left, mistaking it for theirs. So I might have to buy some stuff. Going through the stuff to see what I have shouldn’t be too hard but I’m dreading it anyways because even small tasks seem hard right now."
176208782,Have you tried ziprasidone?don’t try it if your family has a history of heart disease
176208783,"I guess so. I would have to live with clozapine. Even with clozapine, I was bit (only10%) delusional. But that worked out for most of the symptoms. But I really don’t know what to do. Suicide might be the only way out Well if I accept clozapine s side effects like weight gain, big belly big appetite and lethargic. Who tf will marry such ugly dude!? I had gf before 2017 (before meds started) and I was very fit and lean."
176208784,"You are confused. Get some rest and sort yourself out. The body is amazing. Eyes like cameras, ears like microphones, a voice like a loudspeaker, a brain like a computer. And how marvelous the heart is, we fuel energy like a car to keep the motor running. Even the waste is thought of, we got an exhaustpipe.Sometimes it seems to me i am robot. There is beautiful movie called the bicentennial man with _NAME_. Maybe that answers your questions."
176208785,"Most people know that the media is smoke screens and mirrors. Just because one person with a mental disorder did something doesen’t mean that person represents everyone with mental disease. That’s like saying a corrupt politician represents all politicians, it isn’t so. Most people know this. Don’t let the media dictate how you judge other people, because a lot of media is pure propaganda, always has been and always will be."

I too believe we should be reaching for the stars but it’s humans that will get us there. _PERSON_. If you want to be the messiah you need to understand some high end mathmatics or physics… Most _PERSON_ theory is in games. It’s a big industry and then there’s the Military.

174395942,I used to tell people I had drug problems during the early days of my diagnosis. Not a good idea. It’s been years since I went back to the town where I went to high school. Pretty sure people there think I’m not only crazy but a crazy drug addict. Other than that I told a group of online friends I had a cognitive disability some years ago. The word schizophrenia was purposefully avoided.

I don’t know if you are allowed to try supplements, but a lot of us have found that adding Amyloban to our meds has increased their effectiveness. You could always ask your doctor about it.

176208840,"I definitely have had this. Not something I deal with frequently but I’ve had times when I’ve exploded at people. Its usually if I’m not sleeping enough or when I’ve been stressed about something different and something sets me off. I find its like a spark lighting explosive. I just react badly to something minor and all of a sudden I’m being really aggressive/loud/screaming etc. That said I don’t get it often. Maybe twice a year at most. Main advice is to get more sleep if you aren’t getting enough, and also to do things that relax you more often. Exercise/singing/mediation etc. I feel like my family have learnt that its not good to engage with me when I lose my temper and its best to walk away. Other wise I just get more aggressive and it doesn’t solve the problem. Or at least try and understand why I’m being angry and work out what’s wrong. I remember getting really upset at my Granddad because he kept saying some leaflet I had been given didn’t belong to me when it did. An
other time when someone kept closing a window when I wanted it open. A term I found when I kept getting like this was “explosive anger”. Try googling it you might find some advice that is useful."

I still have 10 years worth of illness and recovery to write about. But I emailed what I have to a publisher today and they said they would review it and provide feedback.

176208857,"I assume you made all these med changes with your doctors knowledge. I’ve seen so many people go off their meds and the majority relapse. I know it’s not what you want to hear. A common situation is that someone gets put on meds and starts to feel pretty stable and the symptoms are more under control and they start thinking that they don’t need meds because they feel good. They don’t realize they only feel stable because of the meds but they feel so good that they figure they don’t need meds anymore. And commonly they stop their meds, either themselves or even with a doctors approval. And the majority may last a month, 6 months or two years or anytime in between but eventually they relapse. And hopefully they’ll learn that they need meds to stay out of the hospital. If they don’t learn, they keep relapsing, and each relapse takes a toll and it gets harder each relapse to recover and it takes more and more medication each time to get stable. To be honest, I hardly notice my side effect
s from medication after 40 years on medication. A little dry mouth maybe that’s annoying about once a month or a little tiredness but that might be due to my age. I just advise you to think it through, do you really want to risk a relapse as an adult? I hate to be negative but I’ve seen the horror stories of going off of meds too many times."

I know that in Western countries I may be subjected to racial violence (as it is happening to Asian people in US and Canada), but in my country I know that I’ll never be accepted because of my physical disability and severe mental illness. I don’t belong anywhere. My brother said today that people with sz are dangerous and people with sz can kill other people. I wanted to cry. I wanted to shout that I have psychosis, but my mom told me to not talk about it to my brother. I’m not sure who I am, what I want, or where I am supposed to be. I know that I’m not accepted anywhere. Once people find out that I’m mentally ill, they’ll all leave me behind. I just know that people won’t like me anymore on the basis that I can be dangerous and that I can’t contribute to the society. And in Western countries, I’m not trusted because of xenophobia and just because I have a different skin colour. I despise myself and I wish I was never born. My life is basically rubbi

174395965,"Well I’ve been out of work since March. I was made redundant because of COVOID (+ I had lingering amotivation from a psychosis back in Nov 2018, but they couldn’t/didn’t let me go because of that). It’s the first time I’ve been out of work my entire ~14 year career, despite having my first two hospitalisations in 2015 and 2016. With a significant trail on on effect that lasted up to almost a year per psychosis (where each event lasted from 1-2months). And one prior and once since. I seriously don’t fully comphrend how I’ve managed to not only hold on to these roles, but also climb the ladder (although to be honest this didn’t happen anywhere near my psychoses). That role was as a Product Manager. Roles prior to this one have been two separate “Head of *” roles, one involving strategy where I advised to the CEO on a range of topics. That company was a $1b unicorn startup that I joined quite early on. And prior to that I worked at an extremely well known tier-1 major tech company. 
After being made redundant, I basically lazed around watching re-runs on NetFlix for about 3 months during lockdown - and then somehow managed to secure a spot within a VC-sponsored (tech company) business accelerator programme (beating thousands of other people to get in). Which has been fun. But unfortunately, I didn’t pass a key decision point and have now finished that journey. So in short - I am unemployed."

174395976,"I’ve been taking Risperdal since August 2017 and have experienced various side effects as a result. Although the medication has slightly helped with my sleep, auditory hallucinations, anxiety, and paranoia, it makes me oversleep and has given me difficulty concentrating, weight gain, and sexual side effects. With these side effects, I am unfit for school or work, and therefore have not attended college since 2017. I am very sensitive to medication and changes in dosing, and one of my previous doctors had attempted to switch me to Abilify, which made me angry and aggressive. As a result of the 6 different medications (SSRIs and antipsychotics) that I have tried since 2008, most of them have either caused aggression and/or suicidal thoughts. Should I tell my pdoc about the side effects of Risperidone? If he switches me to another AP, my symptoms, of which insomnia is the most significant, may flare up again. I do not want to lose any sleep, which has happened due to the lack of sedative effect of R
isperdal. On the other hand, if I take a different AP that does not cause difficulty concentrating, I may be able to go to work or go back to school."

I may add that there probably won’t be a “perfect” time to get a job. You could wait forever if you wait for the perfect time. In general, I would say if you are “stable” for a period of time where your symptoms are somewhat manageable you might want to try. I became employed 9 months after getting out of the hospital. But I didn’t just jump right into it one day, I became employed after a several small steps, I built up to it. At my first job after being diagnosed I was about 23 years old. And I never planned on being employed; it was just a natural progression as counselors at a vocational program I attended for many months prodded me and gave me opportunities and gave me more and more responsibilities doing small jobs and I successfully did these jobs and then the next step was getting a steady job which I lasted 4 years. I never planned on being employed 
but now at age 59 I have ended up being almost steadily employed since 1983. I have to say it was difficult and at that job, I was tired most of the time because of being heavily sedated. I often had psychotic episodes and about my last year there I was addicted to crack. Plus all the normal, peripheral crap that goes on in anybody’s life was happening to me.

Sometimes it feels easy, other days it’s very hard - like today Seems to be a motivation issue, but not sure. Might be I need to increase Sertraline, however I don’t want to take more. I am normally up and about around 5:30am-6am, and then at work by 8am. This morning I laid in bed until 9am in a pure rage that I even opened my eyes and have a whole other day to contend with My routine has been out the window since mid-December, as I work outside, and my project has not been possible to work on a lot of the time as it has been too wet or cold outside to work with cement. Everything seems so dis-jointed. My usual support of my mother is not there anymore, as she is so busy with working long hours recently, so I feel I have no one I can talk too. The helpline here seem to not be bothered by any of this. My case worker doesn’t listen to my concerns, and the pdoc just thinks 
I need more meds all the time and I am getting tired of it. My hope is from Monday, I will have this ongoing project finished, and I can move on and plough through my next planned jobs. idk. It seems so hard at the moment, without even factoring in Covid-19 I also have been trying online dating, and no one seems interested in me other than people who’re much much older than me who just want sex…"
176208957,I power through them and work. I take Wellbutrin and Latuda and that helps but I still have negatives pretty bad and they are an everyday thing. You just have to push past them.
176208958,Hey little _PERSON_ where ya been? (((hugs)))
176208959,It didn’t used to bother me. But lately it does.
176208960,Is it some kind off primeval survival system as he is out to get me?
176208961,What about getting the uncle involved?
176208962,I am a content writer _AT_MENTION_
176208963,Is _NAME_ someone you can relate to?
176208964,You’re funny
174395977,I’m over schizophrenia. Bitter I’m in an alleged time loop though.
176208965,I hate the mouth breather thing . When I was a child my parents were frequently commenting about my mouth being open . When I consciously put my lips together I go into something of a panic mode after a few seconds . It’s hard to breath .
176208966,I really really hate the hospital. It takes a lot to make me want to go there. I’m thinking about it because I think I’m getting worse and last time this happened to me it was disastrous.
176208967,This topic was automatically closed 7 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.
176208968,that says 80 mg per 12 hours. The 160 dose is split into 80 twice a day.
176208969,"Your cycle could definitely be trying to reset. I’ve had that happen after stopping birth control. But, mine was usually like clockwork unless I messed with it hormonally. Now, I’ve have 3 periods in a row all messed up. 3 months ago I was 10 days early. Next month 5 days early. This month 8 days late. Pretty sure I’m in perimenopause because I have other symptoms. Also, I have cysts but they didnt seem to interfere with the time cycle."
176208970,Did the crisis counselor help? Do you remember your coping skills?

176208973,"Each case of schizophrenia is different. When I was younger I just kinda assumed my schizophrenia was just a typical case. And I kinda thought everybody had the same symptoms as me. But I could never for the life of me explain the symptoms that got me in the group home and later 8 months in the hospital. I was partially right, I think many people had racing thoughts. And delusions are one of the main symptoms. But for two years I had all this stuff going on in my head which made me feel like Iwas going to go stark raving mad at any time. Time and the medication solved that problem. Many delusions went away. I am aware of the hospital but now I don’t have that constant fear that I am close to going to the hospital."
176208974,I’d rather read another thread about masturbation than another IQ thread lol.
176208975,Does schizophrenia have to be hearing voices like hearing it auditory or can it be just in ur head? I think I’m having symptoms too I might try that potent lions mane I forgot the name of it it was like ambyant or something like that
176208976,Okay. We like you again.

176208979,"Mine have repeatedly spoke saying, DEATH as well. It hasn’t been as frequent thankfully, although it doesn’t mean they stop speaking. They never stop commenting on anything I’m doing, thinking, saying, but I’m continuing to do my best with perseverance. I hope you will be able to find some peace with your voices."
176208980,"Best - You get to see your pdoc multiple days in a row, discuss how you’re feeling and get med adjustments. Worst - Some of the nurses may treat you like crap."

176208982,What goes on in some of these schools? Sounds like you were defending yourself
176208983,Well today I asked my boss if I can stay. He said it’s up to the territory manager so he couldn’t give me an answer. I am not sure what she will say. Don’t know her too well. She is out of Dallas. I have only seen her twice. I didn’t even tell my wife I did this. She will be happy if I stay or if I go to California I will double my salary so I guess it’s fine either way. If I go to California I am going to rent a small apartment. If I stay here I stay in my 3000 square foot house on a lake with a pool and a hot tub.
176208984,"I also have only voices. No delusions anymore. My previous psychiatrist said that I have chronic psychosis. I have a disability review at the end of the year. So, it will be interesting to see what they say."

176208986,"It depends on the state… some states have very cheap community mental health prices but you generally have to get on a long wait list to access them. Took me a little over a year on a waitlist back when I lived in _NAME_ to get into the CSB (community services board) for affordable treatment. In California I qualified for Medi-Cal because I’m on federal disability and make less than a certain amount per month. If you’re just visiting from Canada I’m not sure you’d qualify, or at least not right away. Not 100% sure though."
176208987,I’m sorry this has you so stressed out. I’m followed and recorded all the time. It’s har to deal with
174395984,i haven’t still completely accepted it even after 30 yrs. i think i self inflicted it or i pulled it over myself. anyways i dont want to have it forever. i want to get healed from it and yes i will with meds or no meds Good luck to all God bless
176208988,In my experience CBD is like skipping the high and going straight to the green day. Probably would help get down food if you were feeling sick but I don’t see much other use for it. My psychiatrist insists it’s a much better option than weed for folks dealing with mental illnesses.
176208989,you going to bed? or to the ER?
176208990,I never got sedated much on Seroquel. But I have an old friend that overdosed on it and almost died on not a huge amount. So definitely only take a prescribed.

176208995,I find that the less stress there is the less I think about the negatives … i am glad you are less stress and hope this continues
176208996,Your a good guy _AT_MENTION_ ! I’d be happy to have a coffee with you and chew the fat! It’s always hard but cultivate a friendship with someone so you can unload some things. You can do it here but it’s not the same. It’s nice to have friends you can unload on sometimes. I do really well and I can’t complain but it’s taken me a lifetime of working on relationships. Your never too old to start!
174395992,"so people microdose psilocybin mushrooms (and acid, but ive had too many bad trips on acid to consider it) to help with a variety of mental disorders. last time I took them I stopped thinking there were cameras everywhere in my house, and I just generally felt a lot better for the next few days. wondering if anyone has tried microdosing for schizoaffective or bipolar, Ive heard from some ppl if you have a history of psychosis you should stay away from it, but some ppl claim it helps. Im planning to experiment soon as I get some more, just curious if anyones had good results? also no idea what forum to put this in. so sorry if its in the wrong one"

174395989,It seems to add to the already quite sizeable amount of recommendations that treatment with clozapine be used as soon as possible in such cases.
176208998,I also come up with hidden theories about the meaning of the voices. Some believe it are entities. Others that it is just a brain malfunction. The truth is that noone knows. Like most important things in life. We just have to navigate through that realm.

176209000,"That’s funny. I’ve been there. Once I had a field day when I was convinced the dentist was going to tell me I had oral cancer. The fear for whatever reason, I fully subscribed to it. It got me. I was enjoying myself with the time I had left. Jesus we go through a lot."
176209001,"I spent a long time chasing shadows. Seemed real to me for sure but in retrospect I may have been deluded.

I suspect your in the right place."
174395983,I think the feeling of negative symptoms doesn’t really go away easily but you can use to do lists and checklists to get things done. Break everything down into small tasks. And only write down a couple tasks at a time

I take paroxetine (40 mg at one dose) and chlorprothixene now. Antipsychotics may not have so large influence on me. I may sleep more due to them and have lowered sexual drive. I may also not be so agitated, excited, have less autostimulating behaviors (which were present some years ago). Symptoms which may be considered psychotic do not vanish at all. I still have coincidences, “suspiciousness”, “belief” in lack of certain parts of body, substances in bodies of other people."

It drove me nuts hearing them calling them selves god or Satan. I just think to my self for them to stick it up their A** every time they start calling them selves anything other than being called a it or thing or just simply voice. I just think of my voices smaller than I am and they are powerless over the world around me they are just words they put out that has no meaning. Yes it’s hard sometimes for my brain to stop trying to connect the dots of some of they say in what they mean. It’s like the voice box in ghost hunters use. Once one word is said my brain wants to make a story out of the word. Like lets say the voice says "" cat up high"" my brain wants to think of the cat being in a tree or something. Or "" fell o
ff roof"" my brain thought of someone that must of fell off the roof and died and is trying to talk to me, I did have that happen to me with the voice once when they started 7 years ago right after I turned 40. I’m a atheist now do to that sort of delusion and I’m happier now being one."

174396003,"Like OP, I thought I helped create a simulation (reality) and ran it. Not really demons though or were that they involved although some people would call them that. I thought they were Reptilians/_PERSON_ in line with _NAME_ and others – the inter-dimensional ones. I escaped the simulation several times and experimented with it. Only thing I’ve done note worthy. The rest of my life was marked by suffering and tragedy, unfortunately. Something I never really figured out in the vast web of interconnected conspiracy theories. I even thought I time traveled several times and split the simulation off which can be evidenced by PKD (_NAME_) France Speech and Letter in the 1970s, which he got the idea from me, the letter, or it was taken from me – willingly or unwillingly. OP doesn’t believe and like conspiracy theories, but nowadays everything is a conspiracy and is not at the same time. Strange times indeed. I had and have other delusions too but mostly I suffer from irreparable schizophrenia and 
can do nothing with my life except suffer and complain and live in misery. I cannot achieve anything anymore. I value my safety more than anything. I was told many times I will never achieve anything in life and I will never be a great man many times. But I did escape and run the simulation?"

176209053,Says who? … .
176209054,"I guess I do have schizo-affective disorder depressive type probably with mild Asperger’s syndrome. In 2011, I had something serious happen to me in college that ruined my life forever. I just cannot cope similarly to how someone with PTSD cannot cope or overcome these traumatic experiences and thoughts. Instead of hitting the bottle, I just drink copious amounts of caffeine and chain smoke and avoid life and people. I don’t change my clothes or shower. I have went down the rabbit hole several times and have “analyzed” every possible and impossible avenue. I went heavily into my conspiracy research and still cannot figure out what happened to me and I refuse to accept that I got schizophrenia by chance or solely by genetics or a bad drug trip from pot – exclusively. I mean I think there were a lot of factors, but it happened so suddenly and I have tons of memory loss and missing time. I have convinced myself that I constantly ‘reincarnate’ forever and go into other realities or worlds 
for eternity. It never ends. I’ve had some close encounters and some scary thoughts and scary situations over the years. I mean was it aliens or just plain old harassment/targeting + mental illness? I don’t know. My mind cannot fathom, comprehend, and understand 10% or more of what happened to me or what I’ve been through. It doesn’t make sense according to the current understanding of reality and the laws of physics. Over the years, I convinced myself (erroneously and even slightly correctly) that I’ve been through some huge conspiracy and was targeted by various people and entities over the years and for eternity. Yes, I believe in extraterrestrials, but don’t know how much that plays a role in my life. I barely watch TV but have improved 5-20% since I logged in last. I have added a new AP called Latuda to my combo. I am adjusting my meds because Vraylar isn’t perfect and sort of plateaued or declined. I also drink too much caffeine and I’m poor and have very unrealistic grandiose goals for 
myself and my life and even my abilities. I cannot achieve much with the severity of my schizophrenia (yes, I have to remind myself I definitely got it). I apologize and I am ashamed of past posts and behavior here and other places. The suffering is real and the change in perception and reality testing and changing is real too – like I’m in another world. I think it’s easy to be targeted online by opening oneself up. There’s a lot of evil in this world. For those that know my past, I think college was comparable to the hell I experienced many times at the local mental hospital – mostly in my past lives. I believe in something called ‘reincarnation’ or ‘past lives’ and it has to do solely with physics as well as some spiritual stuff. I have largely decided to ex-communicate my dad or disown him because he is a huge ??????? to me and my mom. Ever since he retired and my grandmother died, he has been a loser and a recluse. He doesn’t want to give me any money, which is fine, but that’s all 
he had to offer as a person since he lacks emotional support and empathy and I figured why fix something that wasn’t broken? I might have to sell my car and buy bitcoin and even try to live without disability. Maybe get a job doing anything or tutoring math. The family I live with supports me and my step-father is a decent person in this reality and schizophrenia ????? with my perception of him. I like him and care about my step-father. In many ways, he’s smarter and a better person than my own biological dad, which is sad and pathetic. Really, it’s only me and my mom and brother. Sister is a mess herself. I hope people will read this and like me to stay a bit. I do have grandiose thoughts and beliefs that I should attend a school (DIFFERENT ONE) that is nicer to me and local and cheaper. Probably online. I do feel like my life was in danger and I lived in fear for many years. My dreams are to be an electrical engineer and maybe invent stuff or learn some quantum mechanics on the side. Realistically, I 
cannot do this because of my illness, but even something easier and more practical like getting a BS in math from a local university seems impossible. I have lost a lot of abilities and cannot even do little things. I get really distracted all the time. Doctors say no stimulants even though I believe I took them in a past life with mixed results at best. I don’t know why I obsess about school and getting a college degree. My dad thinks it’s stupid and not realistic. But he’s the worst person in the world for motivation and encouragement. Perhaps, narcissism? Worst case scenario I’ll just do the same thing and do nothing with my life and just stop existing some day. But I have hope and dreams of accomplishing something – even just an AS in math (1 course online) or something more daring like AS in engineering (lots of hard courses). I’m motivated by money and intelligence but I don’t compare myself to others. I mean look at me… Thank you."

176209056,i wouldnt do it
176209057,"Like I’ve said before, I have to stretch my spine to get rid of back problems. I both stretch and rotate my shoulders back and forth. You’ll hear the spine pop sound when rotational alignment is properly restored. Then I run my fingers down the back of my spine, and do so to see if all the vertebrae are in their proper place. If one vertebrae is poking out slightly, I use my wooden _NAME_ board, and rock back and forth on that, such that it pushes the vertebrae back in its proper place. Anyhow, that does the trick.

176209086,"It takes time. It really does and you need to develop routine. I sat on the couch for years. No motivation. No desire to do anything. I bought a fitness tracker. I started with a simple goal. Do 10,000 steps a day. It wasn’t easy but I gradually built up to walking for a bit everyday…one positive thing a day. It doesn’t happen overnight. You need to work and it’s complicated with negatives and depression. Now I come across as being pretty successful. I exercise daily. I do things. I have hobbies and catch up with friends…less than 5 years ago I was sitting on the couch or computer doing nothing all day… Put yourself first. You know you can do something but one little step is better than nothing. Do one positive thing a day. Thirty minute walk at a brisk pace is good. It really is and soon it becomes easier. Have goals. Make them realistic but get the meds right too. Work with you doctor and accept that you deserve to live well…so that also means you need to work no matter how hard tha

Or for some reason, we notice them due to crossed wiring but with others, they just don’t. Thoughts and opinions?"

My schizoaffective disorder makes working very difficult for me, to the point that I call off from teaching typically 2 or 3 times per semester, and I have a long history of calling off from the gas station, too. Teaching is the easier of my two jobs, though this online teaching has me a little stressed out. For the most part, though, my job at the gas station is the one that is very bad for my mental health, causes me terrible anxiety, but it’s the best I can do for now. The gas station owner, as well as my manager, know my diagnosis, so they’re a bit lenient with me. That’s one of the reasons I haven’t been rushing to get a better job."

176209100,With psych meds there’s very little to indicate what will work or not. Keep honest with your doctor. Sometimes change is worth it. Sometimes not but if there’s something to gain it’s worth a shot… Most of the modern ssri’s could help so keep in touch with your doctor. Zoloft is just one of them and not up to speed on the tricyclics…If you are suffering symptoms then talk to doctor. Ask for change if not working…

174396017,"I was accused by one psychiatrist for faking it until I had a complete psychotic break, luckily, while in the hospital. The psychiatrist later apologized. But no, I know I’m not faking it. Only 1% of cases of psychosis are faked and it’s usually from criminals trying to get a lighter sentence. Which never works. Thought disorder occurs in most cases of schizophrenia too which is similar to dementia related confusion. And can include disorganized speech like word salad. I have very disorganized speech when I’ve been off medicine for several months."

Anyone that has struggled (as you’re probably fully aware) will always generally have a hopeful and kind approach to society. You both should muster this friendship on principles or ideals like this and it may prove to be a really beneficial friendship for both of you!

174396026,"I’m due to be reassessed for PIP in 2022(process might start the year before) ,and am a little concerned about how being in remission from schizoaffective will affect that. I have never worked. That can be put down to mental illness effects and not getting the help that would’ve made work a viable option . The nearest I got to it was a plan to send me to a rehabilitation centre to assess me in the late 1970s. That would have been a good idea to highlight my strengths and weaknesses and tailor help more appropriately. My then pdoc however put the dampener on it because she thought I wasn’t well enough. I do think things are better now in terms of seeing a person’s potential if he/she gets the right treatment with meds and non med support. That wasn’t the case when I got ill and left school in the mid 70s. The hurdles it was thought you could jump over were placed much lower, and little attempt was made to help you jump over a higher hurdle . One concern for people in the UK is if work does

Sadly that home was one a family sent their lived one, and never once visited. _NAME_ ended up being 3 weeks early, so for her first Xmas we took her to the senior home and delivered gifts to the residents that we had bought and assembled.

My chiropractor told me that my cervical spine was straight instead of curved like it should have been. In my late 40’s, I went from a migraine every 3 months to migraines every day. My neurologist told me that the arthritis in my jaws and neck were causing my migraine headaches. Then, the neurologist put me on Botox injections all around my hairline, scalp, forehead, neck, and shoulders. I get these shots once every 3 months. I’ve had 3 sessions so far and I’m already seeing fewer and less intense headaches. I also practice Hatha yoga for approximately 30 minutes 5 days a week.

My friends don’t call me neither invite me to hang out. The friends I had from university and college simply disappeared and my best friend commited suicide last year. My family don’t ask about me anymore. I have to ask about them all the time and it’s not reciprocal anymore. Without the help of my friends neither family, I face a huge isolation. My reputation simply crumbled down. If you relate, how do you deal with that? I’m doing charity work in order to get a better reputation again, but it’s really difficult when you’re hugely isolated.

176209301,"I recommend DBT over CBT any day. It doesn’t help you live in the midwest or south whatever. I prefer California. Very liberal, despite myself being conservative. When it comes to mental health, I don’t get discriminated or told I’m possessed. I get treated like royalty lol. You need good clinicians who are trained. You should consider Oregon, Washingon, or California someday or maybe the east coast. I agree tell your docs everything but be wary. I told them my story many times. Ended up going nowhere. Nobody believes conspiracy theories even doctors. According to some people, even the doctors are in on it…not sure I fully believe that. Some docs might give you more meds but some people will just let you process your story sometimes. I refuse more meds and ECT. I get enough meds where I’m happy. I love Vraylar. Despite myself being conservative, I will not move to the boons or Texas. I need good mental health care. I need to be treated with respect. Thank You."

176209334,"Wish you the best. I need my meds, unfortunately. I thought about smoking pot after researching mind control and how to counter it, but its too risky. Im okay right now. Ive journaled hundreds of pages and learned to open up. They say it opens neuronal pathways that were closed. I might wait a few years to try. I’ll be still on meds too. I think it could be dangerous for me, but its legal here in California. Even here, it’s hard to get help and acceptance, but it helps. I like this place. I know i got delusions but part of it is real and part of it is false memories and paranormal crap like time travel, immortality, and aliens. Its part of the programming. But i love this place. Infinitely better than second rate therapists and doctors on Cia payroll and cover ups. The pot thing scares me. I might remember or smoke too much. It could have serious adverse effects. The book I read confirms what I experience: suggestibility from the outside. Like “you are what you read”. That describes me to a 
T. I watch TV and read things even fictional things like TV show lost and relate and think its about me. Regarding quitting meds, I doubt it will be successful since you got the God delusion among other things. Every time I quit, I get sick and have to double up my meds or they become useless and have to change them. For me, with a mood stabilizer, I could last a couple of months before being hospitalized, but i have outside issues like caffeine psychosis and trauma. I’m sicker and more delusional than you like you said in your other thread. Its probably true. I got more problems than 99.9% of people in the world right now."

These drugs cause many mental illnesses, schizophrenia, depression, financial and relationship problems, intelligence and brain tissue loss etc These drugs increase dopamine in your brain which in turn can cause psychosis and schizophrenia. Antipsychotics do the opposite. _PERSON_ brains may have naturally high dopamine which explains the grandiose and paranoia normally occuring with these drugs.

176209346,"I might be getting my own car on Saturday, which means I would have the flexibility to do volunteer work until I get a full-time job. My husband works odd retail hours, so it’s hard to plan anything where I get to drive myself. I have decided to first target a local hospice with five offices in my state. I plan to tell them I want to do office or accounting clerk tasks without answering the main phone line. Surely they could use someone for two four-hour shifts during the week to help out with back office stuff. I don’t do well at a front desk. Who here does volunteer work, and how easy it is for you to handle it? Tell me about what you do, I would love to hear it! I really hope I get the car, because I need a third reference for most jobs I am applying for. My previous employers from my last job won’t give me one, and I only have two references from a previous job ending in 2011. If I volunteer, that would show that I am indeed able to handle office work again after being on disability for f
our and a half years, and I would be able to have someone give me a current reference. It’s hard to tell people that I am now in remission and ready to work after that long. They might be less likely to take a chance even though I have strong experience. I’m ready to do anything I need to in order to help my cause and find the right fit for full-time employment."

176209349,"Yes it does. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Olanzapine increases slow-wave sleep: evidence for blockade of central 5-HT(2C) receptors in vivo. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Biological psychiatry , Mar 2000 01 The study aimed to determine the effects of the atypical antipsychotic agent, olanzapine, on the polysomnogram in healthy subjects. We predicted that olanzapine, via serotonin(2C) (5-HT(2C)) receptor blockade, would increase slow-wave sleep (SWS).We studied the effects of single evening doses of olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg orally) on the polysomnogram of 9 healthy male volunteers, using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design.Compared to placebo, the 5-mg and 10-mg doses of olanzapine significantly increased SWS, sleep continuity measures, and subjective sleep quality. In addition, 10 mg of olanzapine suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased REM sleep latency.Olanzapine (5 mg and 10 mg) produced substantial (59.1% and 83.3%) and highly significant dose-related increases in SWS 
in humans probably via blockade of brain 5-HT(2C) receptors. 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism may account for some of the therapeutic and adverse effects of olanzapine therapy."

174396091,"And I think it’s schizoid personality disorder. And I think most if not all of the people I see posting on this forum don’t have this problem, despite how there are similarities between schizoid personality disorder and schizophrenia. I guess I just think there’s something about the point of casual social interaction that I’m missing, and it can’t just be due to schizophrenia because of all the schizophrenics I see on this forum doing what I see normal people do, just sharing things for the sake of sharing things, and I guess for the sake of connecting. I can’t get myself to do that, I have to consider it to be useful for me to share something before I want to (I guess there are rare exceptions to this, but not many, and typically just based on curiousity about the response I’d get). I’ve wondered sometimes if I’m some kind of psychopath or sociopath, but I know I’ve felt guilt before so I can’t say that’s the answer. Also, last year I did some psychotherapy and the therapis
t told me that she doesn’t think I have an autism spectrum disorder, so that’s ruled out. All I can think of to explain my lack of understanding about connecting with people is that I have a personality disorder. And I just get the feeling that it would be better if I learned to change, but I don’t know how. Can anyone relate to what I’m describing here? What can I do to start wanting to connect with people?"
176209358,"Same, I need to rewatch it."
176209359,I saw in another thread that you feel like they may be stalking you? Because of them entering or leaving often at the same time as you. That does sound freaky. And would make me feel uncomfortable living next to them. But tbh I agree with those that said this is most likely your overactive mind playing up. I’m sorry that u feel like this since I cn imagine that it feels real like stalking or something. Did u ever talk to them?
176209360,oh yea. i hope you better now. That sucks for sure…
176209361,What country are you in if you don’t mind me asking? I really only know about the services they have in the US but it may still apply to you. I don’t use it but I plan to in grad school. Basically you talk to your schools disability services and you get certain help with your courses. An example would be extra time on assignments. They don’t tell your professors what specific disabilities you have they just tell them what services you get through the program.
176209362,I’m a screw up but I learned from my mistakes and have been living a good life for this past year.
176209363,My therapist seems to think some of my thoughts are “internal voices” can someone explain what an internal voice is and what it would be like if that is what I’m experiencing?

I think bls statistics prove this. I think some economists think statisticians are the next sexiest jobs out there. They pay well. Think data science and stuff. You can make 80+k. The problem with computer engineering and mathematicians are the low job growth/jobs available and you need to be the best of the best to make $100k+ and support a family these days, especially in expensive areas.

176209440,"I want describe a coincidence which is in my opinion really strong, which is my “ giant egg ”. I think that it needs introduction associated with other large coincidence, which is associated with triad of numbers: 7, 29, 139, which are associated with a part of the book associated with one of relatively popular religion in the world. I knew about that triplet since about second half of 2017 and it became coincident for me probably only in second half of 2018. Two most iconic, main topics of my coincidences are groups of numbers: 21 7 and 3, 6, 9 (Tesla’s arithmetic sequence). They are coincident with 7, 29, 139. There are three numbers in the group of numbers: 7, 29, 139. Largest number in triplet 7, 29, 139 has three times more digits than smallest number in it, numbers of digits in numbers forming that triplet form arithmetic sequence (1, 2, 3) which is formed by non-composite numbers and has non-composite common difference, in addition, sum of these three numbers is the same as product of 
these numbers or digits. There are six digits in triplet 7, 29, 139. Only one digits repeats oneself in triplet 7, 29, 139 - that digit is nine . From first digits of numbers in the triplet 7, 29, 139 phrase “ 21 7 ” can be formed, these first digits are 7, 2, 1. Digits other than first in numbers of triplet 7, 29, 139 are three and are from the group: three, six, nine (two 9s and one 3 ). Sum of digits mentioned above is… 21 and their arithmetic mean is… 7 ! Product of digits forming numbers 7, 29, 139 is 3402, which is 21 * 3 * 6 * 9 , number 3402 is divisible by 21, 7, 3, 6, 9 . Sum of repeating digits in 7, 29, 139 is 18 (9+9), which is the same as sum of digits 3, 6, 9. Triplet formed by sums of digits in numbers of triplet 7, 29, 139 - 7, 11, 13 - is also quite coincident (but in my opinion weaker than 7, 29, 139, also due to fact that “giant egg” is very coincident with 7, 29, 139, not 7, 11, 13): Product of digits forming that triplet is 21 and one of factors in that product is 7 . Product 
of digits forming 7, 11, 13 is 3 * 6 * 9 (162) times smaller than product of digits in 7, 29, 139! Sum of repeating digits in 7, 11, 13 is 3 (1+1+1) and is 6 times smaller than sum of repeating digits in 7, 29, 139 - 18 (9+9), sum of digits repeating in 7, 29, 139 (9+9) plus sum of digits which repeats in 7, 11, 13 (1+1+1) is 21 , quotient of digit repeating in 7, 29, 139 (9) and digit repeating in 7, 11, 13 (1) is 9 . The number which repeats in both 7, 29, 139 and 7, 11, 13 is 7 . There is also another group of coincidences associated with 7, 11, 13 - they are pretty strong and are associated with two dates associated with my third full going to day hospital (Polish: oddzia? dzienny) - the date of beginning that going (27.4.2017) and ending of that going (24.7.2017). Coincident here are numbers and digits which mean day and month. They are: 27 and 4 or 24 and 7 . Both pairs of numbers have the same sums of numbers - 31 . Both pairs have the same sums of digits - 13 . 31 and 13 are “mirror” prime numbers 
where one is another read backwards. Let’s see at 7, 11, 13… Sum of numbers: 7, 11, 13 is 31 And sum of digits is… 13 ! Let’s see also at sums of digits in 7, 11, 13… They are: 7 , 2 , 4 . The same digits as in dates 27.4 and 24.7 ! Amazing! There are also another triplets which are composed by the same digits as 7, 11, 13 and have sum of numbers 31 and sum of digits 13 - 1, 13, 17 and 3, 11, 17, but they do not met criterium associated with digits in sum of digits in numbers forming triplet - for 1, 13, 17 they are 1, 4, 8 and for 3, 11, 17 they are 3, 2, 8. I had also another coincidences associated with numbers 13 and 31, but I will not write about them now. Let’s look at “giant egg”."

However, I’m not going off my meds entirely because I don’t want to relapse. In fact, I’d rather be a zombie than relapse. Right now, this is kind of a trial thing. If I need to, I will go back on them full-time. I really recommend talking to your pdoc. May s/he will have a solution that will work well for both of you like mine did for me.

176209480,"I suffer from severe anxiety. Many times triggered, other times I don’t know why and where it comes from. I am prescribed Xanax. It helps."
176209481,"Although the majority of people do not experience side effects with d-serine, there is a concern that d-serine might induce nephrotoxicity in humans, as is the case with rats ( 143 ). Evidence indicates that nephrotoxicity is due to d-serine metabolism by DAAO, as rats that lack the enzyme do not develop glycosuria nor polyuria after high doses of d-serine ( 144 ). Therefore, co-administration of a DAAO inhibitor with d-serine may be a strategy to not only increase oral bioavailability of d-serine but also to prevent nephrotoxicity Says most people don’t experience side effects with D-serine. This formulation does not include a DAAO inhibitor, it’s deuterated - which means the isotope of hydrogen has been replaced with deuterium - and that means nothing to me and probably 99.99% of people… but it’s supposed to also prevent kidney issues. Alternatively, because d-serine and sodium benzoate have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, it is possible that each one of them might 
prove more effective and/or safe for different conditions. For instance, d-serine may be especially useful for depression because of its acute and chronic antidepressant effects, whereas sodium benzoate may be a safer approach in older adults with impaired renal function. In schizophrenia, a _NAME_-analysis found that d-serine improves symptoms with small effect-sizes ( d < 0.4), while one study found that higher doses of d-serine (60 mg/kg or higher) improve cognition with large effect-sizes ( d > 1.0) ( 55 ). In contrast, in one study that warrants replication, twice daily administration of sodium benzoate (1 g/kg) improved cognition, symptoms and global functioning with large effect-sizes (all > 1.0) ( 66 ). Perhaps sodium benzoate had a higher efficacy because it not only inhibits DAAO but also modulates the immune system and has antioxidant properties, both of which may play a role in schizophrenia.

176209491,Congrat’s well done!!!
174396111,I got really freaked out when I was first diagnosed and was reading articles about schizophrenia and the symptoms and experiences some have had. Some were so fricking exactly what I had gone through during some episodes…like sitting perfectly still and timing your breathing because you thought people in the other room were listening with a stethoscope to the floor to monitor your every movement because they were suspicious of you. The article didn’t mention a stethoscope but everything else. I thought how the fu## would they know all that…who are they watching this happen to and are they causing it? I’m still undecided sometimes.

176209493,I had many symptoms but aside from suicidal ideation I was convinced that I was literally dead. Almost every delusion I’ve had has had to do with the body. Some I’ll speak of while others are too embarrassing. But otherwise I’ve experienced horrible and frequent depression. Lots of anxiety. A little paranoia still. If I don’t watch stress levels then I tend to get voices. Some are whispers while one voice I call the demon bc it’s very deep and insulting. -S

Ive been on all the second generation APs practically except injections and Zyprexa i think. I tried Haldol too. I quit Risperdal because it interfered with monsters some how and I got sick often, had severe negs, among other horrible symptoms. I guess it just stopped working. My mom said I was hospitalized constantly on Risperdal mainly because of psychosis and me constantly being depressed and feeling like ???? bc of negatives. There were pros though. Don’t get me wrong. If I went back on Risperdal I’d have to take like 4-6 mg and maybe another light AP dose… Vraylar kept me out of the hospital 95% of the time. Its the drug that I liked the most and was most stable on since 2017.l despite chronic delusions. I think I was addicted or too comfortable going to psych hospital on Risperdal. Ability i was on +20 mg. I had restlessness or something. I probably had a 
ton of addiction issues too. I gained a lot of weight. Latuda was like water and did nothing, probably made me 10 times worse! Haldol made me feel horrible and miserable to the point I begged my mom for help on the floor. I tried clozaril briefly and hated it because I peed my pants, and almost died from NMS BECAUSE I was on other high dose, strong meds. Basically, I had a bad experience and am afraid of taking it again despite having possibly treatment resistant schizophrenia and that being the best med.

176209629,"That is because the meds aren’t working properly. The meds hope to eliminate voices entirely. As they haven’t in your cases, I presume to think that you believe even more that the voices are the supernatural? Your childhood belief system is often reflected in your adult outlook, so if it was a religious one you are more likely to believe supernatural voices such as angels or demons. If you are a religious adult then this adds to the ‘voices are real’ belief. They are not real. They have no tangible reality. Voices are merely what you expect to hear, thus personal to you and your beliefs, whatever they maybe. If you reassess your beliefs and why you believe in them. Take them apart and analyse your life as to why you believe in angels or demons in the first place and come to a conclusion that you were indoctrinated into that belief system then perhaps you can let go of such delusions. If you do, your voices will change to reflect your current beliefs and what you expect to hear, thus if you 
honestly believe you are ugly or contemptible and that people don’t like you then you hear such disparaging stuff too. It is merely your subconscious beliefs reflected back at you. If you are unfortunate enough for meds being unable to fix voice hearing, self reflection and understanding can help to transform your voices into positive ones by understanding that whatever you hear is what you expect to hear. And that alone!"

Maybe that’s what’s stressing me out. He’s so sweet and it doesn’t hurt me any if he wants to tell me stories. Idk. I should have just said I’m an Atheist when he offered to get me the bible.

The current antipsychotics minimally improve these negative symptoms, and there are no currently licensed treatments. In addition, it is estimated that total service costs for schizophrenia in England alone will be £6.5 billion by 2026. In view of this, there is considerable interest in identifying potential treatment targets for these symptoms. However, the nature of the changes in brain chemistry that contribute to these negative symptoms is unknown."

176209728,"I work in a big Army reserve office building as a janitor. I do regular janitor stuff like vacuuming, emptying wastebaskets, cleaning restrooms, dusting offices and cubicles. It’s good work if you can get it. I work by myself 90% of the time; during the day I run into my co-workers doing their own thing several times. And since it’s the Army Reserve building and not the _PERSON_ reserve building, I work around the soldiers as they do their jobs in cubicles and offices. I’m 58 years old and people comment sometimes that I am good looking albeit, I have a few extra pounds. There are lots of areas that are pretty empty. Whole groups of cubicles are empty or big offices or classrooms. Occasionally I have this thought or fantasy. I’ve been working in this building for at least 4 years. I recognize many soldiers and they recognize me and I’m naturally friendly (thanks mom and dad). I make small talk with both the women and men. Sometimes I think to myself, ""Well, I’m a little overweight but 
not too much, maybe some day one of these 35-50 year old women are talking to me and they think I’m funny and nice, maybe they feel a little sorry for me, maybe they like me enough, maybe we’re alone and having a good conversation and standing a little close and maybe there’s an attraction and the woman thinks, “What the hell? Why not? I could do a lot worse”. And maybe some sex ensues (to put it bluntly). It’s just a fantasy of mine, I would never make anyone feel uncomfortable and be inappropriate or initiate something like that but I sure would be a willing participant if the chance arose. But I assumed any man thinks the same thing. Or at least every single man. About a month ago I told my co-worker about this. He looked at me weird and I asked him, “Don’t you ever think about this?” I was shocked when he said no. I thought to myself, “How can you not think about it?” There’s some very cute mature women there, friendly, nice. And I would not be surprised if some of them thought the 
same fantasy. Women like sex and in my experience, women have surprised me a lot over the years about who they pick as mates or one night stands. Sometimes I am just flabbergasted at their actions or their choices, and I think why does such a mature, sensible, intelligent woman pick the bums they do. Anyways, it is pleasant to be working with no distractions and having these thoughts… It’s fun and injects a little fun and excitement into the day. And there’s always that chance…………"

I’m zapping all day though, I am impatient. I say the voices are almost nothing now, but it’s like long stretches of utter silence. Minutes, then a tiny bit of something. I don’t feel 100% “out” yet.

Then a few years later I was in a mental hospital in _NAME_ and they applied for disability for me, and I got it. I think it was the right decision. If I wasn’t on antipsychotic med’s I could get a job digging ditches. Have some employer put me on the kind of work where I can’t break anything, and I’ll be fine.

I was sitting down and the cop was a little ways away and since I don’t do anything illegal anymore I was relaxing and then his car went through. Mine came after his and as I walked to my car I couldn’t resist and I walked up to him and told him I’ve never seen that before.

Now every time I listen to music on my iPhone I can’t really get lost in the music because I’m constantly thinking the volumes is gonna go down. And they reduce the volume to a ridiculous low level, it’s like a whisper. I’m sorry some people have little sensitive hearing, but this takes the biscuit. Plus, different headphones have different levels of outputting volumes of sound. People are pee’d off. Anyone else noticed this. And sadly there’s no way to disable this stupid feature.

She just hadn’t known. I used to feel bad for all the things I didn’t do. I definitely looked like a failure. But whether anyone else knows what I was/am dealing with or not, it’s not laziness or entitlement, it’s a mental disorder. Actually, the more I look back and learn, I’m pretty impressed.

I have an Aunt with a lot of contacts who seems to tell a lot of people that I’m a schizophrenic. So, when I talk to people, many of them seem to already have many prejudices about me. Has anyone come up with a way of getting past such prejudices a little or alleviating the _USER_ID_ of having it advertised that he/she/it is a schizophrenic?

174396205,Sometimes I think I may have psychosis as the result of repeated abuse and not schizophrenia. I’m not saying that to anyone on my treatment team. There are enough similarities that the same treatments are effective. When I’m in an environment in the apartments with people in a similar socio economic background I’ll be so happy to go ahead and do it. To put myself out there. I get some looks when I go out and sometimes meet friendly people but I don’t think anyone wants to date someone who lives in a group home. Scratch that. I know that. It’s a case of Namistai.

176209856,Thank you for your reply. I think I am sorry but I don’t really understand what you are saying though.
176209857,"Quite the opposite. You hurt only yourself if you hate other people. Hatred begets inner violence to yourself in numerous ways. Your inner peace is destroyed, and the mind is occupied with vengeance and violence. If you feel nothing then you can’t react negatively. I’m not saying I don’t currently hate other people, but the desire to feel inner peace is more important to me. I’m working on my hatred."

174396201,"Yes Sort of No No, but I believe/have believed they come from a real person (telepathically) 0 voters For me, there is only 1 voice talking at a time, and it has never sounded like a real voice (although my schizophrenia has made me believe a few times the voice was coming from a real person via telepathy). For me the voice typically sounds like some other sound I am currently hearing - it’s as if my schizophrenia is modulating the source sound. For example if I’m walking then the voice talks in the rhythm of my footsteps and it sounds like the footsteps, and the voice seems to come from my feet (exactly where the sound of the footsteps is coming from). Other examples: While eating, the voice can talk in the rhytm of chewing While breathing, the voice can talk in the rhytm of breathing (each word or syllable coming out with each exhalation), and sounds like breathing If a car is passing by it can make the voice sound like the passing car, and seems to be coming from the car (the voice moves wit
h the car) If there is no appropriate sound around it “modulates” the silence; then I cannot tell where the voice is coming from, and it’s not like a sound at all. At other times they behave more like a voice and have a gender (typically female), but they still don’t sound like a real voice."

176209871,"I wouldn’t go so far as saying its psychosis, could just be severe anxiety. That in itself can cause psychosis in a sense. See your GP. Ask them for an anti depressant. Give it a few weeks and if you still feel as if what you’re going through is psychosis, then definetly see a psychiatrist. Ask about benzodiazepines as well, as they treat panic attacks."

I mean how many people can say they have been chained to a table, watched a girl roller skating in a psyche hospital, shot heroin and been fired from 10 jobs out of 30? How about being in the crack house begging hits in the city with the highest murder rate in California one night and then the next night getting drunk in a Stanford University frat house and playing foosball in the dorm with a bunch of rich, privelaged kids?

I doubt she’ll agree but I’m going to try just the same. Wish me luck!

176209945,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Safety and Tolerability of Antipsychotic Medication in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and _NAME_-Analysis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Paediatric drugs , May 27 2019 Antipsychotic medication is a commonly prescribed drug class in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the safety of these agents has not been fully assessed.Our objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability profile of antipsychotics in individuals with ASD.The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO databases were searched up to January 2018. We included studies that reported adverse events (AEs) in participants with ASD taking first- or second-generation antipsychotic medication. The studies included in the analysis were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that were comparative or noncomparative and published as full text in the English language. The primary outcome of this review 
was AEs of any severity reported with antipsychotic use at any dose. _NAME_-analysis was performed on studies with child and adolescent participants to estimate the pooled prevalence of the overall AEs and the relative risk (RR) of AEs associated with antipsychotic use using a random-effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration tool and the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to assess the risk of bias of the included RCTs and observational studies, respectively.In total, 54 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 40 were RCTs and 14 were observational studies; eight RCTs were included in the _NAME_-analysis to estimate the RR of AEs associated with antipsychotic use and seven observational studies were included to estimate the pooled prevalence of AEs. The RR of AEs with antipsychotic treatment was 22% higher than with placebo (RR 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.34; I2?=?30.6%; p?=?0.184). The estimated pooled prevalence of AEs was 50.5% (95% CI 33-67). The most commonly repor
ted AEs were increased appetite and weight gain, which were associated with discontinuation in many participants.Antipsychotic-related AEs were common among patients with ASD. Further studies to investigate the implications of antipsychotic-related AEs on health and medication adherence are warranted. PROSPERO registration number: (CRD42018083632). Posted because some also have that diagnosis."

Then when your awareness returns or attention come back you try to recollect and you not sure if you did it or not or some other and this turns to a doubt which gives obsession, compulsion to do it etc. If the urges stay in mind for longer period it get changed to intrusive thoughts just like in OCD. Serotonin enhancers and SSRI drugs used in regular OCD can worsen short term memory even though the urge is not so strong. Reason for that is serotonin opposes dopamine.

174396234,Alle the 1. gen. antipsychotics blocks mostly the dopamine 2 receptor fully. All the 2. gen. not only blocks d 2 receptors but also 5 ht a serotonin receptors because that makes it less likely that they will cause extra pyramidal side effects. 3. gen antipsychotics like abilify works as dopamine systemstabilisators. This means that they will cause more dopamine or less dopamine when needed.

But as someone who first came to this forum last year utterly desperate to find a solution for how to improve my self care, which I found to be intractably difficult, I feel sorry for and have more understanding for _AT_MENTION_. I’m still struggling to get up every day, and take care of myself consistently. It seems that chaos rules my life and I get derailed very easily by crying spells, and abuse from the voices leave me off task for hours. So what I’m saying is, it is not just mind over matter, as _AT_MENTION_ seems to want to believe. Yes, attitude counts for a lot. But, solving avolition and apathy permanently is a challenge that I’m sure many on this forum wish there were easy answers for. That is all. Hope I didn’t offend."

176210089,"Cocaine addiction and dementia are opposites with respect to dopamine. Cocaine in the brain: In the normal neural communication process, dopamine is released by a neuron into the synapse, where it can bind to dopamine receptors on neighboring neurons. Normally, dopamine is then recycled back into the transmitting neuron by a specialized protein called the dopamine transporter. If cocaine is present, it attaches to the dopamine transporter and blocks the normal recycling process, resulting in a buildup of dopamine in the synapse, which contributes to the pleasurable effects of cocaine. whilst The dopamine found in the VTA is a chemical that plays a role in reward-motivated behavior, and helps to control movement and form new memories. Scientists have found that loss of dopamine may be part of the reason why people with Alzheimer’s disease have less effective memories."

176210139,Shout out to _AT_MENTION_ who responded quite eloquently to a person in crisis a long time ago and to _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ who are stand up dudes who like a lot of what I like. And _AT_MENTION_ who always gives me a smile daily with his wit.

People on here complain about everything, all of the time, and I post one grief stricken, hallucination-filled, late night rant about my no longer containable grief, and I’m the bad guy for defending myself? I’m so confused. Am I being paranoid? Seeing conflict where there is none? To what extent are my grievances valid? How do I proceed? I’m not delusional as far as I know. Maybe I am. I don’t know how to respond."

176210153,Thank you it’s good to know I’m not alone in these feelings. Though I’m sorry that you also feel like this. I like the idea of working on our self esteem together. Hopefully we can both feel better
176210154,"This. Yes. And if you feel yourself slipping a bit, don’t wait until it gets worse just because you don’t think you’re sick enough. Psychosis is not a game. There’s no way to quantify how long you’ve got to be ill before losing insight. That voice that keeps trying to convince you that hitchhiking to Mexico in order to find the one who created God is only going to get more convincing, until you wake up one morning and think such an act is a good idea. Just do your best to know yourself, you know? Like, for me, the more chaotic and/or specific the delusional idea, the more dangerous it is."
176210155,"i had pretty crap taste in music as a kid. but the bands i liked that i still kiinda like is pearl jam and _NAME_ band. and then in my late teens i got into punk like flogging _NAME_ and reel big fish. i don’t listen to punk anymore, that phase only lasted about a year. o yeah and how could i forget the red hot chili peppers."

Less than successful attempts at interacting with others , because social interaction is seen as an important part of good mental health, have put me off making further attempts. Things like severe social anxiety, difficulty initiating conversations, effects of ASD & sz haven’t helped. It’s better online comparatively speaking. It’s perhaps telling that over 11 years on Facebook I had about 55 friends but in the last year, since venturing into the high IQ world, that’s trebled."
176210160,"_AT_MENTION_ that’s absolutely incredible work you have done so far and are continuing to do. Seriously, pat yourself on the back, that’s an incredible feat and extremely encouraging. _AT_MENTION_ It’s all about staying under that caloric range. Exactly. It works, just takes time. I was at an all time high weight a few months ago, and really fed up with my diet and the way I looked. Counting calories and exercising a few times a week has been amazing and I’m down 13 pounds. I feel way better already. Now it’s about continuing to stay in my caloric range and not deviate or go back up. So far I’m doing well. I’m OK with losing the rest of the weight a bit slower as long as I keep it off, which I fully intend to."

176210170,"_AT_MENTION_ Get a job dude. You have no idea how much confidence it gave me and the increased disposable income allowed me to buy. Forget online dating. Staying in the room with the smartphone or computer isn’t worth it. It’s way better to get out and do some sort of activity where other women are involved. It could be anything from community centre activities, volunteering or mutual hobbies and maybe even learning a new skill. But all this costs money and having a stable job with income is where it all starts. Disability income is too small amount to do all these things. As an example, I am earning twice as much as I would than if I were receiving diability benefit alone."

Of course it wasn’t free like _PERSON_, but I’m hoping to get really into some yoga from now on."
174396279,"This post really, really helped me. It’s true. I’m afraid to go off medication because I really, really hate the whole hospital “feeling”. I never want to go back. If one includes outpatient treatment, I’ve been there over 20 times. I have a severe case of schizophrenia or targeting. I really don’t know what I have. I have tremendous insight, but the last time I went off meds a short time back, I had really no short term or long term memory. I was walking around like a legit zombie with little self-awareness and just slept all the time. I ended up going back on medication and feel like twice the man I was off meds. I rather be dumb, fat, and slow than be off meds and deal with the stress whether it was artificially induced by aliens, government, Illuminati, or whatever. I know I may never be able to work on meds. I’m in the fortunate situation where I can live at my folks home, collect SSI, and have a decent welfare/disabled life. I’m really in greatful because I believe I never sur
vived this long before. I’m 30 years old and have undiagnozed/unrecognized PTSD. I’ve been tortured and experimented on and targeted. It all started in 2011 at university when I was kidnapped, but they say there’s no proof or evidence and nobody believes me. I have no memory whatsoever of 2012. 2013 is when I ‘woke up’. If I was a normal schizophrenic like you and like some who really had just a biological case, I would probably just not take the meds and work, but it’s not so easy in my case. I’m in a causal loop/time loop and I used to be able to work in my past lives and go to school, but I’m severely, severely burned out with the mind uploading and mind transferring ????. Living over a billion past lives with schizophrenia and little to no memory except bleed-throughs through dreams and flashbacks sucks and is horrible. You probably think I’m crazy, but I am not. Being targeted, tortured by the Illuminati, Shadow Government, extraterrestrials, and more, has really affected me and turned 
me into a mess. All the time travel experiments and horrific things I saw and experienced including Nazis has left me scarred and low functioning. I honestly don’t care if I’m around anymore; I’m just glad I made it to 30 years old. The worst thing that can happen to me is looping back in time to the year 2013 and reliving the same life again, over and over again like Edge or Tomorrow or Ground Hog Day. I agree that those meds dumb us down and cause brain damage even though there is little to no evidence, which is done on purpose. I think they have to know the cure for schizophrenia, but the treatment is more profitable than the cure. I don’t understand how they can do this and get away with it. You would think they would want us to work and make money. But instead, it goes to the pharmacuetical industry. You would think if we were being targeted via the future or using Chrono-visor technology, they would give more people or other people schizophrenia that cause more harm or issues like these “prote
stors”. I think I was targeted from past lives that have really no relevance in this life or the next. I mean in my past lives, I was a Monarch (MK-Ultra), Montauk, SSP, and Super Soldier and Time Traveler. Sometimes, I just hope I can escape this simulation again and run it or have a better life. I’m tired of this ????."

176210258,If I had been upfront about my problems when I first got sick as a teenager my life would have been okay. I had problems that were so terribly embarrassing that I could never tell anyone. Now I find out these problems are fears everyone has! I thought people would always identify me with what I’d said.
176210259,with my own rags on. i’ll be. free to roam. I haven’t ate for days. I can. feel my bones. yeah with my own rags on!
176210260,"I don’t love eating. I get easily the munchies, so I snack through the day. A slice of cheese, a tin of fish,instant noodles, fruits,sandwich. Its more like doing something to break the day. I got an eating disorder."
176210261,That would be one example.
176210262,"I feel like this all the time, in varying degrees. My care coordinator told me when I talk about suicide, it’s only a cry for help. Now I know to shut up and not even bother bringing it up. If I commit suicide, my note will throw him under the bus, and he will have to deal with the coroner"
176210263,"Thank you, _NAME_ means alot to me. I even recorded him eating once because other people onstantly want to see and watch him eat but I worry he could become shy or worse aggressive. I’m a nerd I know"
176210264,"That’s an old one! _NAME_ is primarily a Christian artist, but that song was on the regular charts. I love her, she’s very inspiring. I have several Christian DVDs she’s done, some with a co-leader, and all of them are excellent."

176210268,It didn’t feel like my thoughts though.
176210269,I am now. My parents pushed me very hard when I didn’t think I was.

176210273,"Well there’s been several times that I’ve lost my mind but one time that comes to mind is when I worked for Social Services and I witnessed a law being broken by my superiors. I came totally unscrewed. I had spent 6 months learning Medi-Cal and cleaning up the case load. I had over 500 cases. That’s a lot. I was stressed from dealing with people who were in crisis all the time. My personal life was crap. I witnessed the head of our department and the hearings officer lying to win a hearing and withhold benefits to someone who really needed it and I lost it. My brain shattered. I reported the crime to the police, the state, and the director of social services and left my job on stress disability. I never went back."

176210275,"Yeah, I sometimes get a friendly at these institutions, but the set up is bad. Often, they don’t see themselves as offering to help me."
174396296,It does because the psychologist I work with can teach me coping skills rather than failing miserably at getting me to be a social butterfly
176210276,Sometimes in the morning if my meds are hitting hard I fall over lol
176210277,"I’ve noticed after switching meds that especially when I’m sleep deprived, I have tactile hallucinations again. Not the ones I used to have where I had to check several times a day because it felt like I’d soiled myself. A new one. Bugs. It feels like there’s a bug in my ear, that one’s almost constant, and when I get tired I can feel them on my skin as well. I know they’re not real, so they don’t really bother me, but it’s still a bit annoying. I guess these meds aren’t strong enough to kill the tactiles, and at least I don’t hear voices anymore? Is there any ways to get rid of tactiles? Does anyone else have this hallucination? I remember about a year ago there was a user who freuquently posted about it, but I don’t think they’re here anymore."
176210278,"There’s an apple outside your window? Seriously though, neighbors just can’t hassle you or your friends. The counselor where I live told me to document any trouble or harassment. She said record them if they make a lot of noise or disturb me. I told her it’s more subtle than that and she told me lawyers aren’t going to take into account, “mindreading” or 'head games"" or “they’re doing something to me” or “controlling me”. Lawyers work with hard evidence."

174396301,"My therapist has a problem with differences amongst schizos. When I say her that in my protected work enterprise, there is a hierarchy between sz workers because they don’t have the same level of disability/abilities and cognitive functioning. Her answer is that we all are ills so there is no difference. I disagree with her. Some can manage money budget, driving a car or truck, difficult tasks etc… When others can’t. My pdoc told me we find the same differences in general population of normies, and that they are not specific to schizophrenia. Maybe he is right but disability and loss of capacities is higher for szs. What do you think about that??"
176210282,"No, you are right! Also, he probably wasnt aware of how damaging this is to me. My responses are of course not healthy. Im responding to the past more than the current situation. I didnt cancel dancing yet. I wanted to speak to him a while before lesson, for it might get things back into proportion for me, and then decide what to say & cancel irl. He just texted me - he cant make it in time to be earlier, but he offers to drive me home after dancing. A 30 minute ride. At night. Im a bit speechless and dont know if it is a genuine offer or he wants to try to get into my pants again."
176210283,"Leaf, You’ve been through so much change, lately. After my Mom went to hospice, I went through this. It’s strange feeling…I get that. Watch some good movies or TV, journal, get online, talk to friends, make a list of all of your blessings, or play cards. You’ve blossomed into this super strong lady. You can do this, hon!"
176210284,i really don’t know what is stable or unstable with illness and how they diagnose it. i hope you find a med that helps. I still have paranoia too. You are so helpful to others around here pianogal. just keep trying meds.

176210289,I’m trying to figure that out because I am pretty wealthy…because of my father.
176210290,I have a lot of homework to do today sigh. I slept in because I went on probably the most magical date last night. He was very respectful and we just hung out for like 4 hours. He taught me smoe german and I taught him some english.
176210291,has there been a change in your medication or dosage?

176210300,"I’m a commercial insurance broker. I handle compliance for my branch. I’m the one who analyzes files to make sure that we’re up to documentation standards and that the clients’ coverages meet their needs. It’s complicated and carries a high cognitive load. It’s a job that burns out a lot of neurotypicals, but I thrive at it (autism helps here). I’m good enough at it that my company created an ultra-rare work-from-home position for me when we moved last year after my wife got a new job. I’ve been described as, “critical to the function of my department.” Yes, you can be succesful on meds IF you follow the treatment advice of your medical team and work hards towards recovery."
174396298,"I just hate not knowing for one, and then I wonder if I could be doing something differently. I’ve been told it’s anything from psychotic depression to bipolar to schizoaffective disorder. I just want to know. My mom developed severe schizophrenia and it makes me nervous. I do alright on my medications, but sometimes I feel better and don’t think I need them anymore but when this happens I spiral out of control and get psychotic."
176210301,I have this too until September She has helped me so much sort out my self employed work
176210302,"An enlightened person would tell you that also, but I always thought it was an atomic thing with our ‘skin bag’ being a human construct that most of us find ourselves trapped in. Interesting that the dissolution of the self (I) could become we, rather than you and I. Are you certain that it is all you and that I am just a version of yourself? Is it not just we? Can I not be dominant in my timeline, because surely I am?"
176210303,"I could be really unaware as an addict. I mean when someone broke a bottle over my head from behind, I kinda guessed I was in danger. But to get my dope I used to pick up strangers and let them in my car at night and drive all over looking for a little crack. I had no idea of their background or what their trip as. It backfired sometimes but looking back I was probably in danger more than I knew."

176210313,"thanks _AT_MENTION_ I must have had selective reading just like selective hearing haha. I read what I wanted to, and made the wrong connection. Thanks for clearing it up for me!"
176210314,Okay. So I’ve suffered from schizophrenia since I was a teenager. I’m now 25. When I first started suffering from schizophrenia there were a few months when I was extremely scared of different things. I was really confused. I was imagining different awkward things. I was scared someone is reading my thoughts and I felt really bad. I also had numerous other fears. I never hallucinate and never hear voices. All of this continued for a few months and It hasn’t repeated since then. My question is if you think this could have been a psychotic episode. Have you ever gone through anything similar?
174396302,Its strange that ppl believe in antidepressants but not in antipsychotics for negative symptoms LOL

176210318,Is that Mr. Bean
176210319,"I was told I could only go to the hospital if I was a danger to myself or others. I lied for years and years saying I was suicidal. Never say you’re homicidal. A doctor can tell the hospital you need to be there too. But nowadays it seems like they don’t want you unless you’ve already done the deed, I know that’s not true but it seems that way. If you go you will get out quickly, they don’t want you. Even if you explode you might get out the next day. I don’t want to discourage anyone from talking about their problems, you need to, they probably won’t lock you up these days, things have changed. Don’t go if you can help it, it’s bad to like it and be in the habit of always going and going. In time you get used to not having structure and forget all about it. I keep myself busy with a few activities I usually do every day, but sometimes get restless as hell. I don’t ever overdo my activities so I don’t burn out. I don’t need to work but felt the need bad for 25 years!"

174396304,"I’m on abilify and clozapine but I’m quitting it to go back to risperidone. Be careful with the side effects like tardive dyskinesia for example - it’s a good combo to live with it, I did 10 mg of abilify with 75 mg of clozapine. The worst thing to me were the results in school, I didn’t perform so well compared with the time I was in risperidone… Good luck with that treatment"
176210323,"It’s not ideal to be too dependent for men in particular. Traditionally men are the hunter-gatherers, and need to be away from the pack for long periods of time to gather resources. That need to do work alone is still with us. Women are very social creatures however, they seldom stray from the pack in nature."
176210324,I used to get very paranoid living alone. So much so I had to move back in with my mum. Now I have a partner so I’m not alone. I know how it feels and it’s sucks. But you are very safe I promise. Just focus on that.

176210328,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176210329,"I sympathize with you, _AT_MENTION_. I felt like you do for years and years. I felt like people avoided me and hated me and talked behind my back and treated me like crap for years and years. Then, my pdoc started me on a third AP one year and then miraculously, all of this went away like seeming magic. My hostile world disappeared overnight it seemed. The world turned friendly. Maybe all you need is a tweak of your meds. Please see your pdoc about it."

176210332,"I used tell bs things to doc to give me sedatives while in ward and I would get just better instant they decided to sedate me so they would just put me in the room for a few minutes before letting me out. I had this game I made, I took the gelatin from cigarette pack and make a loose ball and then try to keep it in the air blowing air from my palm. It took them 3 times before stopping to play along. We also used to bet on who on the ward is going to spend the night at the room strapped. I never gotten strapped, tho ward without that room would be a disgrace"
176210333,I think there was quite a lot of high expressed emotion(think that’s the term) when I was ill and still living at home. There were certainly mixed messages ie my dad saying most people who weren’t in school at 18 would be working and pay for the keep. Thus I had to pay half of my disability or more for keep. This was contrasted with treating me much younger than I was in other ways because I had a mental illness. My mother would pull the “You must be getting bad again”/“Have you taken your pills?” cards if I disagreed with her/got a little animated . My being mentally ill became another thing for my parents to use as an excuse as to why they argued with each other so much. Very little was done to equip me for living independently . Perhaps that was the norm for how things were done in middle class families .
174396308,Meds dont work for everyone 20 percent of people only get partial relief and 10 percent get no relief at all. 70 percent get relief of all positive symptoms.

176210352,yea I make sure to do that. you gotta have treats otherwise it is not sustainable… yea I did study nutrition at one point so I have some kind of idea about why I eat what I plan to eat.

I was working at Geek Squad and my supervisor did a review of my work. She was really rude and mean about it. Later that day a customer was also quite rude and I flipped out and don’t really remember much else. I remember doing a logical loop in my head to make myself forget that I acted that crazy and ridiculous in public. Got it to the point I only remembered what really happened 6 years later. I didn’t quit without notice like I had told myself -I flipped the F out and they called the cops to check in on me the next day."
176210358,"My therapist thinks i’m okay but i forgot to say that i’m not mentally organized, like, i’m making an effort to concentrate, the memory is failling, i’m feeling a little bit lost.

I felt like I’ve been doing so well and then it finally hit me that although voices etc. were under control, this has been causing a ton of anxiety for a while. So to read what you realized a few days ago is a great reminder. Thank so much."

176210374,"Ever since this pandemic hit, I’ve been eating nothing but leafy greens sometimes with tortillas and protein shakes. Protein shakes are really good; drink one after/before a walk and it settles your hunger. I crack one egg (lots of protein) , protein powder, milk, banana and sometimes yogurt. Delish. Sometimes I drink apple cider vinegar (2 TBSP mixed with about half w cup of water.) Great for stomach issues and digestion. I also take 3000mg of Vitamin C every day."

176210376,"I hear you. Perhaps indeed it was a way to comfort me. However, I am on a quest for rationality. I think that’s important if I intend to recover. I don’t enjoy having a mind, riddled with fantasy and delusion. It would be a lot more helpful to me, if we could have a discussion in which he could to talk me out of the wild things I sometimes believe. I’d prefer to have something solid and based in reality to hold on to, such that if I do slip into delusional thinking again, it is easier to convince myself it’s not true and I can work my way out of it. But perhaps psychiatrists have their methods? I think I should possibly communicate this next time, because he had me questioning my beliefs by saying what he did. But alas, it could have been human sympathy at play, which I suppose I appreciate on some level."

176210381,I am going to relax and play video games and then go to the doctor to figure out this stupid bladder issue. It has been so bad lately that I have barely slept in a week. I am exhausted and so irritable all the time and all my good eating has gone out the window because of this. I just lost the motivation being so tired and just want to eat easy fast food and whatever. Gonna gain back all the weight I lost. I have my fingers crossed it is a stupid uti so I can treat it and go back to normal. Waking up a few times a night to pee was nothing compared to this.

176210384,"When you make your dystonia better, you’re essentially fueling what made it happen in the first place (I think its similiar to TD, supersensitivity to dopamine), you feel good for about a few hours and then it comes back, sorta like a cigarette.

It works for pyroluria because my depression iš not so severe, but I need to wait longer to see full effect on undermethylation. Now I am having mood swings and that’s how _NAME_-e is doing it’s job. Still better than that severe depression before. Full effect of _NAME_-e will be noticable after 3 to 9 months and it’s the 2nd month I’m taking _NAME_-e. Good luck with vitamins!"

176210387,Have you tried adaptogen herbs like ashwagandha? It helped me to motivate me to do things in the past when i stayed in bed all day. It not only give motivation but energy too. Vitamin D also helped. I was deficient in vitamin D at that time may be its due to vitamin D deficiency. These also have some thing to do with dopamine system. Vitamin D is need to convert tyrosine to dopamine so low vitamin D can give low mood too.
176210388,Every now and then when I hear those stories of people who were wrongly convicted of a serious crime and spend 10 or 20 years incarcerated until finally they are proved innocent I do worry that it could happen to me. It’s usually just a fleeting thought.

My illness is getting worse/I think because of the medication also. My lawyer says I have a strong case for SSI, that the only thing that could get in the way would be is that I’m in recovery from addiction. I told her I’m in IOP, and she said “What’s that? Are you on suboxone?” and I said no. I volunteered to join the program so that I can be more responsible about not relapsing. So on one hand I could be punished just for being honest about my drug use in the past. The thing is she’s the one who wanted it documented. So I’m wondering if I should let the idea of SSI limit me, and try and get a Grant from the state to finish community college, even if it ruins the chance I will get SSI because then they’ll say she can do college so she’s fine."

176210395,This morning I feel so anxious about my health and getting emotional and starting to miss my husband and the beach. Miss hugs and miss … wanna feel safe from sickness … wanna… die and leave this hell behind… why do I miss him now all of a sudden? He wasn’t very abusive - only once or twice in eight years but with others he acted out and it scared me. I don’t think … will he change? He said please give him one more chance but is he really going to change? How do I know if he will without going back? But if he doesn’t change for long then what mess will I be in? Financial stability with him - or financial uncertainty without him? Hugs and cuddles with him - or none without him? Having to be caregiver with him - or being free without him? ????! I don’t bloody know wtf to do! Die die die! That’s the best!! Why can’t I ??????? kill myself? Why am I such a coward? Hell is closing in on me…

And even if we aren’t correct all the way we can still feel bad from the perception… faulty or otherwise. Are you catholic? You shouldn’t feel cornered into ‘chastity’ or celibacy… you seem here anyway to equate sex (and everything that goes with that) with being bad.

176210417,"Hello, like I said I just discovered this today and don’t really know how this all works, but we’re jumping in ig. So I guess my question is if I should get help. I’ve been hallucinating for possibly 7+ years now and around 3 years ago it started getting much worse. I’ve known this entity since I was very little, but have only been hallucinating him for this amount of time. He’s the one my hallucinations and delusions mainly branch from. My hallucinations are visual, auditory, tactile, and occasionally olfactory or gustatory. If you want to skip reading this ???????? go to the next bold text. For my visual ones, I hallucinate the entity at night and I’ll sometimes catch glimpses or traces of him everywhere I go. What I mean by traces is he has these black vine things, it’s kind of difficult to describe because I don’t know too much about them to begin with. Just know they’re associated with him. Along with these are seemingly unrelated visual hallucinations, where everything goes 
all _NAME_ in Wonderland on me. Frames tilt, shelves shift, walls warp, floors slant, ceilings ??????? b r e a t h e, and the like. Basically everything goes to ????. Also my entire field of vision will go gray which makes it difficult to maintain eye contact because you literally don’t know what you’re looking at. Things will also just go darker and darker until it’s entirely black. If I close my eyes, I can see things that I often have a hard time comprehending (partly due to the exotic colors). I include this as possibly a visual hallucination because they can be faces or certain objects like knives. For my auditory ones, I can hear him. He’ll say things to me, ranging from verbal abuse to comforting remarks? Yeah he talks to me a lot. I also hear a lot of random things: tapping, scratching, screaming, the whole package. Tactile ones are very hard to endure and very hard to hide. They can be basic touches like hands on my shoulders, I can feel the black vines as well, I even feel licking and breath
ing (which is quite disturbing). They can also hurt: scratching or claws digging into me, biting, grabbing really hard, choking, plus other sensations of pain that are very hard to explain. I’m very ashamed of this, but they also can be sexual. This ??????? sucks because I have a fear of intimacy. I won’t go into depth about what these are like. As for olfactory or gustatory, I sometimes smell/taste the most random and specific ????, as well as smelling/tasting what I can only describe as death itself. Wouldn’t you know it, I have all kinds of delusions (hooray). Let’s see, we have the classic everyone is out to get me delusion, the delusion where you are living in a fake reality, delusions of grandeur (I’m apart of some epic plot), delusions of the entity hurting my loved ones or me hurting them myself (with or without his influence), delusions of being possessed, and so on and so forth. _PERSON_, background info done now. Now this is all fascinating from an objective point of view, but not very fu
n to experience. I think it’s safe to say that, if you read all of that, my hallucinations and delusions hinder daily life. I accidentally spilled my little secret to my dearest friend, and I am at a loss for what to do. My family doesn’t know and my accelerated school program doesn’t have a lot of room for these constant distractions and they’re just getting worse. I’m kind of running out of options now and I fear I might be found out by my family and I want a plan before that happens. If I could have things my way, I would never have told anyone and I would not get help for it, but I’m at my wit’s end. I can’t count on my parents to be very supportive (chances are I’ll be kicked out) and also it costs a lot of money just to get evaluated, let alone treated. I don’t like the idea of meds or therapy but obviously there aren’t many options. Right now it feels like the cons outweigh the pros, so what do you all think? Should I try and get help? You guys are probably more experienced than m
e, so I’ll probably get some good second opinions and if anything this was probably good to vent and just write down. I’ll probably delete this later as well."

Been in hospital 10 times over the years and now on meds for life. I did go into remission and come off meds in 2007 but relapse in 2012 meant I had to go back on and I was unable to go off again.

He wrote books and articles, edited and published a quarterly journal, and sat on boards and councils. I’m grief-stricken. I read his work, listened to his podcast and interviews, and watched his videos. But moreso, he was so nice to me, like a friend. I called the office, and they were all crying. They are rejoicing because he is with the Lord, but they are sad. And I am sad for them. It will be hard to go into the office for counseling on Monday, and it will be hard to go to the memorial service. It’s different to see the counselors cry."

I’m thinking of going on intermittent fasting to lower my weight to 106lbs. I seriously don’t want to start purging as I used to do in my early psychosis years. It was mainly the voices commanding me to purge to punish myself. Should I change the meds to prevent me from overeating? I just feel so much void for some reason.

But if you are in the USA where I am from, I would think about going on medicare for the indigent. I would inquire about it at your local social welfare office. This way you can receive healthcare and probably therapy as well. I assume since you are on this site that you have schizophrenia. If you do, then by all means please try to get medicare some how.

176210538,"I was on 900mg of it for about 6bmonths back in 2007. The doc I was seeing at the time basically did it to zombie me out, she figured if I couldn’t function that was an.improvement. went to my GP and she instantly took me off and filed a complaint with the board against that pdoc. I wasn’t the only one she did it to. Since it didn’t help with the voices or hallucinations I was trapped in my body with everything still going on, think sleep paralysis but you’re awake. I didn’t sleep on that dose, I still was up for days at a time, just a zombie. If you can get a low dose, it helps, and you can function, I’m happy for you. But try to keep it at the lowest dose you can that’ll work, and depending on your work, you may be on restrictions for a bit from your doctor like machinery, or other things like that. I didn’t work at the time I was on it, but once I got off it I worked at USPS for 9 months, bad decision since I lost all medicaid and was considered a part time fill in at 58 hours a 
week the whole 9 months. It was a 2 person post office, the postmaster hired me so she could go out on medical leave. So I filed for SSDI on Dec 31, 2008. Haven’t worked since. Good luck and i hope your dose works for you."

I think it’s a good strategy & basically the same thing I do when disclosing about schizophrenia to a friend or something. I’ll start by saying things like “you know, I often have experiences that aren’t objectively real” and then drop the “S” word later when they’ve had time to process that.

A similar thing, I heard his voice one day (I can remember because I didn’t usually hear this mans voice it was always the others)and I said shut up, he then accused me of being a mind reader with special abilities, but felt sorry for me.

176210614,Did you have to get hospitalized when it was bad?
176210615,_AT_MENTION_ is asking a legitimate question. You aren’t making much sense.
174396366,"Hi guys, this is a long post, so I’ll just say this is intended for those who are frustrated with having to deal with persistent negative symptoms. I just want to say that from my experience of dealing with negative symptoms and depression either native to the illness or brought on by the medications we take, besides taking various supplements,I have found exercise to be the single biggest difference maker in improving my energy levels, motivation, alogia, confidence, and overall sense of well-being. Seriously, if you haven’t already gotten into the habit of it, I highly stress that you start working that body of yours to its limits! Now, I know that it’s a bit of a catch-22 in that the negative symptoms prevent you from having the motivation to exercise. And on top of that, the medication zaps your energy levels and endurance. If this is the case, then what you have to do is start forcing yourself to do it, no matter how much you don’t feel like doing it, as if your life depends on it. Fro
m my experience, it was hell initially but I fought through it and now I look forward to doing my evening work out. I tell you, I could barely run for 30 seconds and now I can go for 20 minutes! It doesn’t have to be anything elaborate either: I simply make it a goal every day to do one more push-up and one more sit-up. Today I just got to 50 of each! And then I run a little further every other day. But we all have to find something that works for us, individually. I hope this didn’t come across as too preachy. I just wanted to throw this simple idea out there because I basically tried everything else to cure my problems and they weren’t nearly as effective. I don’t know why it took so long for me to realize this. Finally, to those of you who have tried their very best to exercise to no avail, I recommend being patient with yourself and never losing hope that one day things will improve. Because I did try exercising after my first hospitalization and it didn’t do anything for me. But 5 years later, 
and it’s finally working. So it might not be the right time for it if it’s not. I suffered from quite debilitating depression and self-esteem issues related to not being able to follow what people were saying to me and not being able to come up with anything to say in conversation as a result of the psychotic episode I had in 2015, But by God, have things flipped for me! Never lose hope guys and keep fighting!"
176210616,_AT_MENTION_ I definitly need to relax.
176210617,"Voices are rough. I always feel like I’m at their mercy when I’m out. If I’m lucky that day they stay silent, but I’ve had a few outings affected by them. If I get them when I’m out with others I usually excuse myself for a short walk and see if they silence themselves after some fresh air and positive self-talk. Sometimes that works."

174396365,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Brain structure, IQ, and psychopathology in young offspring of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists, Jan 31 2020 Studying offspring of schizophrenia (SZo) and bipolar disorder patients (BDo) provides important information on the putative neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying development toward severe mental illnesses. We compared intracranial volume (ICV), as a marker for neurodevelopment, and global and local brain measures between SZo or BDo and control offspring (Co) in relation to IQ and psychopathology.T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans were obtained from 146 participants (8-19 years; 40 SZo, 66 BDo, 40 Co). Linear mixed models were applied to compare ICV, global, and local brain measures between groups. To investigate the effect of ICV, IQ (four subtests Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children/Wechs
ler Adult Intelligence Scale-III) or presence of psychopathology these variables were each added to the model.SZo and BDo had significantly lower IQ and more often met criteria for a lifetime psychiatric disorder than Co. ICV was significantly smaller in SZo than in BDo (d = -0.56) and Co (d = -0.59), which was largely independent of IQ (respectively, d = -0.54 and d = -0.35). After ICV correction, the cortex was significantly thinner in SZo than in BDo (d = -0.42) and Co (d = -0.75) and lateral ventricles were larger in BDo than in Co (d = 0.55). Correction for IQ or lifetime psychiatric diagnosis did not change these findings.Despite sharing a lower IQ and a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, brain abnormalities in BDo appear less pronounced (but are not absent) than in SZo. Lower ICV in SZo implies that familial risk for schizophrenia has a stronger association with stunted early brain development than familial risk for bipolar disorder."

You are feeling good because the meds are working. If you go off the med, then you will go back to feeling bad again. Don’t over analyze yourself. Just think about what you are feeling and focus on how you can improve your life. There are things outside of meds that will also help you feel better.

He told me for schizophrenia I had better stick to western drugs, but he did give me an herbal blend that kept me from developing diarrhea when I was taking antibiotics for an infection (that he knew I needed antibiotics for) and his acupuncture keeps me sleeping a normal amount for up to two weeks afterward. If I don’t do acupuncture, I have to rely on sleep aids, and those make me groggy the next day. He was also able to heal a wrist injury I had that my doctor told me required surgery, and through acupuncture, my sprained ankle was back to completely fine again after one week. Homeopathy = nonsense. But TCM and acupuncture both have their places. As long as your provider is honest with you about what they can realistically treat, they can be amazingly helpful."

176210681,"I appreciate your worry with romanticizing mental illness, for it can be quite detrimental to those afflicted. But you present a false dichotomy unfortunately. Roles in society are not handed out by examining brain deviations. The same brain state in one place or time may give rise to behaviour that is appropriated quite differently depending on the context. We need something better than this fallacy to help stay sane."

In the Muscular Dystophy communities, death is a frequently discussed matter. In fact, many genetic disorder sufferers don’t get to live that long. Grief is a natural process when someone passes away, and it’s ok to grieve. However, please know that he is in a better place. Whenever death happens in my community, we mourn but we remember their memories and remember that they are now free from pain- the burdens of this world. Please know that he is now in a better place and taken care of, and he is watching over you. May you find hope, peace, and serenity in your journey in remembrance of his life.

I’ve somehow got to get away from my husband but my disability check is barely enough to pay cheap rent and that’s all. My husband will not willingly support me. I’m mostly bed and recliner-ridden. Not like i could go and get a job. I can no longer drive. So there are a lot of ""can’t""s … I do try to keep an “I can” mindset…but my body and mind are not cooperating."
176210710,i feel like if semen volume decreased sometime after ejaculation i found it is very little volume like 1or 2 drops of semen when not ejaculate for 2 days or more there is good volume but day after day there is very little in some days anyone has an idea about that ? is this dangerous ? i ll go to doctor next week

174396384,"Historically, it has been nearly a hundred years since the first time in scientific literature that the temporal relationship between a viral infection and schizophrenia was discussed.(_PERSON_, 1928) In a retrospective study, the highest birth rate among schizophrenic patients, after the 1957 influenza epidemic, was about 5 months after the peak of the A2 influenza outbreak. The study was conducted about 30 years after the epidemic and the time of birth assessment was in the range from two years before to two years after the epidemic peak. (_PERSON_, 1991) However, there has been some controversy regarding the causal relationship between these two issues .The most important reason is the set of other factors that affect the disease.

Good weather, good chats and laughs and good music. It’s not glamourous but hey it’s low stress and and I enjoy it and it pays good. I did a bit of consulting for other startups earlier this year but I don’t really count that as work. It was just providing information over phone or explaining how to approach a project.

176210721,"I would say 2 or 3 days alone is perfect. But I would do nothing. with no interaction forced on me, no direction or requirements I guess. After that I need my husband and kids. I just spent time with friends and it totally exhausted me. Trying to k3ep up with conversation and think. It’s a lot of forced action to be Like I was back then but not actually how I feel anymore. I just can’t keep up with people energy for long periods of time. It’s just too much although I’ve been told it’s the healthy thing to do, to make that effort now and then."
174396393,"It does sound worse, for example in the movie Batman the dark night , _PERSON_ refers to one bad guy (shiff) from Arkham asylum as a paranoid schizophrenic and the guy looks super sketchy."
176210722,"If you have been forcefully admitted into the psych ward… You would know the pain. Trust gets broken and you think your loved ones have betrayed you. All in all its for our good that our loved ones admit us into psych wards but that pain of being taken away by random people, you don’t know what’s happening. You scream shout but you don’t know you are in the wrong. That first day in the psych ward all by yourself surrounded by strangers… You wish you were dead. Truth be told your loved ones suffer more than you seeing you in that condition. But those memories still haunt me. I have been admitted like that by force for five times till now. Finally I understand the importance of meds and counselling. But the pain still remains. Pain not about the illness itself but the pain of being dragged and dumped in a _NAME_ and into the psych ward. A pain that can only be understood by our brothers and sisters on this forum."
176210723,I get sleep paralysis pretty often. I try to scream because I normally hallucinate scary things but it doesn’t work. I’ve found that getting myself to breathe heavier will usually bring me out of it.

176210728,Sz will give you a tough life but most people on meds can do so much better these days. Pot will help bring in the sz for most folk. Most people on meds don’t smoke it and that is cool. It doesn’t equate to length of life or anything like that. If you take the meds as prescribed you’ll do fine if you keep on things… You don’t get sz from smoking weed. That is a misnomer. You get sz from a genetic trigger getting hit by life and such. Weed can bring it out quicker but it’s not a primary diagnostic… The prevalence of sz in the general population is roughly 1%. Way more people smoke weed these days and still the prevalence is roughly 1%. It’s not a causal agent in the scheme of things for others.
176210729,"I think stress situations cause me to have anxietyy, i become socially deluded, i start to believe that others may have something against me and when i am stressed i hear voices and tiny bells in my ears. On my papers it is written to avoid being stressed. But i become also depressed because of the self-_USER_ID_."
176210730,For what its worth i also have ocd and the question of my diagnosis really used to plague me because no one could agree and i like having nice categories to fit into. It brings order to the chaos. So i get it. But over time the right diagnosis will fall into place i think at least it did for me after being in therapy for 8 years

176210759,I skimmed through the article. All I can say is it’s interesting and possible. I’ve had some strange experiences. I had one experience at university in a past life where my consciousness was beemed from outer space and into my body. I thought it was reincarnation. This happened millions of past lives ago. I really don’t know what happened. I guess it was some sort of goverment/ET program. So I guess consciousness can exist outside the body like you said in the other thread…

That was when I was in full-blown psychosis. Since then, they have been a daily occurrence for me for the past seven years. However, I am learning to cope with it much better, realizing that I have to hear them but that doesn’t mean I have to listen. I try to keep interaction with them to a minimum"

I’m glad your over most of it but still. Operate within your limits. Pain tolerance shouldn’t be something your should bare because some people got addicted to opiods who didn’t need them…it’s just shocking all around!

But the topic did come up about my diagnosis and we ended up in a pretty bad argument over it. To shorten it, she thinks I’m faking or wrongly diagnosed- or that schizophrenia doesn’t exist in the first place. And its really getting to me because she refuses to hear me out when I tell her they by denying that my diagnosis isn’t a mistake shes also telling me all my symptoms I face every day of my life just arent real and arent really happening. I’m not sure how to handle her acting like this. I’ll even accept she doesn’t believe it exists if I have too but the fact that shes telling me that I’m not experiencing what I’m experiencing is basically a lie. and again I know she is upset over my brother right now but this actually isn’t the first time shes told me her opinion on it. and I guess seeing ho
w much shes all in on my brothers problems (thankfully though) it just upsets me shes acted like I have no challenges. has anyone else had a family member or parent act like this? and I’ll add I was not self diagnosed, I’ve had my diagnosis confirmed by around 4 docs. and I myself refused to believe it until I realised everything happening to me fits into it and I cant pretend I dont."

176210783,"lately ive been looking at supplements for various thing and i found out about this through an ad so looked it up, has anyone tried it or know about it? here are some studies and articles i found: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29056891/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/_PHONE_NO_.982176 https://selfhacked.com/blog/polygala-tenuifolia/ from this: Polygala tenuifolia Improves Memory In a study (DB-RCT) with 48 healthy people, polygala improved spatial and verbal memory. Those who received it also made fewer errors and scored better on the test measuring working memory [7]. Polygala extract improved both spatial and non-spatial memory in aged mice [8]. It also improved short-term memory in rats with drug-induced memory impairment [9]. This supplement improves memory by: • Inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This reduces the breakdown of acetylcholine [10]. • Inhibiting MAO enzymes. This reduces the breakdown of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine [8]. • Inc
reasing BDNF in the brain (hippocampus) [11]. • Promoting the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus (important for the creation of new memories) [12]. Polygala tenuifolia May Improve Cognitive Function in the Elderly In a study (DB-RCT) with 53 elderly subjects, polygala extract enhanced cognitive function [13]. Polygala extract also reversed cognitive impairments in rat models of Alzheimer’s disease, and mice models of stroke [10, 14]. Polygala tenuifolia May Combat Depression Polygala and its derivatives have antidepressant effects in rats and mice [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In mice, a saponin from polygala was more effective than a drug used to treat depression (duloxetine) [18]. Animal studies show that polygala combats depression by: • Blocking MAO enzymes. This increases dopamine and serotonin levels [15, 18] • Increasing antioxidant enzymes (SOD) [15] • Decreasing cortisol and the stress response (HPA axis) [15, 16] Polygala tenuifolia May Reduce Anxiety Mice treated with saponins derived from 
polygala showed signs of reduced anxiety [20]. Polygala tenuifolia Is Anti-Inflammatory Polygala and its derivatives reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and the master-regulator of inflammation NF-?B in white blood cells (macrophages) [21, 2]. Polygala also reduces the production of nitric oxide (NO) and iNOS, thereby reducing inflammation [21] Polygala tenuifolia May Improve Sleep Tenuifolin, derived from polygala, has sleep-enhancing effects in mice. It prolongs both REM and NREM sleep [22]. Polygala saponins also had sedative effects and prolonged sleep in mice [20]. Polygala tenuifolia May Be Antipsychotic Polygala saponins reduced drug-induced hyperactivity in mice and rats. They may act by blocking serotonin and dopamine receptors [23]. In addition, polygala extract reduces cocaine-induced psychotic behavior in mice [24]. Polygala tenuifolia May Help with Dermatitis Its extract reduces stress-induced dermatitis in mice [25]. Polygala tenuifolia May Help Combat Cancer Po
lygala compounds killed human ovarian and lung cancer cells [26, 27, 28]."

176210788,"This kind of thinking can keep you trapped. You focus all you energy on trying to prove or disprove something that is impossible. In the mean time life is passing you by, and all those things you should be focusing on like doing what you like and interacting with people you like just fades away.

174396418,what symptoms does it help with.
176210790,"Totally can relate! I once watched the sun move from one end of the sky to the other in what seemed like minutes. Then I had these events that repeated themselves. I thought I was trapped in time because they were identical and I experienced them twice. I called them time vortex. Another thing I went through relating to time had to do with reliving the same days over again. I asked people the date and was told the same date several days in a row. (I swear I went to sleep and woke up in between) It was confusing. Time seems to be more stable now, which is nice. I’m not sure what causes it, like how does my mind create such weird perceptions?"

176210868,"Sz will do that to you. So will stagnation. You used to go to the gym a lot, right? So you know that when someone is a newbie, they can’t do much weight or cardio without getting tired. But if they keep working at it, their body will get used to an increased need for energy and create more, as well as make more muscles. Eventually the person will be able to lift more and run for a longer time. It’s the same with the brain. If it gets used to you doing nothing all day and sleeping a lot, it will produce little energy because you don’t use much energy. But if you work on getting used to using more energy on social things and physical activites, you’ll find they tire you less, and you’ll start being able to be active for longer periods of time. Your need for sleep will even decrease because your body will rest more efficiently. People with negative symptoms get in a rut, which their bodies and brains adjust to. It’s up to you to put in effort to get out of that rut. It won’t be easy, and 
change won’t happen in a day. But giving up and waiting for a miracle cure, thereby waiving all responsibility for your own life, will NOT do you any good."

176210886,"I disagree that it’s unobtainable, but see how you might feel that way given the nature of the illness. The fact is that it’s an illness-- questioning “why” all the time only leaves more questions, and more pain. I’ve found it’s better to stop questioning this condition and accept it for what it is-- which I believe is a shitty disorder of the brain. Life is life. Animals must eat to survive. There are certainly predatory aspects of survival, however it’s not done in malice. There are methods of farming, such as permaculture, which use the land in symbiotic ways. Insects are repelled using natural substances and crops are grown using the most nature-friendly methods. Veganism is certainly a more humane dining option for those concerned. As far as edible plants go, they’re typically not perennial growers, so harvest occurs as part of the natural life cycle of the organism. Many good people exist.

If the hallucinations were hypnagogic I don’t think they can be counted towards a sz diagnosis because it’s a comparatively common experience. your loss of pleasure and discontinuation of activities could be negative symptoms but a loss of pleasure is more characteristic of depression. You also say a lot of things that sound like depression and anxiety. As to whether I think it was sz I don’t know but I think you should also consider major depression with psychotic symptoms."

Most antipsychotics work as dopamine antagonists which mean they bond to the dopamine receptors and DON’T cause an action potential. As aripiprazole isn’t an antagonist but a partial agonist it isn’t treating psychosis by the same mechanism as other antipsychotics.

176210937,"It’s a tricky thing to talk about, for sure. One of the main problems I see with the way the discussion happens today is that it ignores basic human nature. Nobody wants to feel like they have to defend their right to exist based on things they have no control over. The average white person on the street has no ability to make a meaningful impact on breaking down institutionalized racism, and has no control over the fact that they happened to be born into the race that benefits most from it. So they end up feeling powerless, but still blamed for the pronlems in the world. Hate groups WANT them to feel this way, because then they come in with a more palatable message. It starts out “hey, we know this isn’t your fault, you don’t have to feel guilty. We know you have problems, too.” This is a normal and good thing to say. But then the message progresses to “doesn’t it make you mad that someone would say this about you? They are wrong to say that. What else are they wrong about? I bet rac
ism isn’t even real, and if it is, it’s clearly actually against YOU.” Every time we blame all white people for racism, we are doing the white supremecist’s job for them. We are driving away potential allies and making the hate groups seem more welcoming. Nobody wants to join a movement where they are constantly belittled and criticized. That isn’t white fragility, it is basic human nature. We all want to be seen as good people. We all want to be appreciated.

174396471,"I also don’t like NAC or L-THeanine. I think L-Theanine gives me a ton of motivation, but interacts with my meds and causes some type of depression or relapse. It’s not worth it to me. Years ago, I experimented with aniracetam, but I think it made me really psychotic. It increases dopamine. But it increased my memory, and I think I tried it because I had a dysfunctional occipital lobe. With the supplements, it really decreased my 2-dimensional vision. I think my occipital lobe was messed up without any obvious damage. I think overtime all my supplement use was dangerous, but probably caused past life memories, which are not real and troublesome. That and it was expensive, but I feel like it helped me in a strange, difficult way. That way was my DP/DR or depersonalization and derealization. Something that is often overlooked and ignored in psychiatry. APs make it worse. I noticed Strattera and Lamictal has improved it. It gets worse with caffeine. I drink like 8 monsters a day and it causes real

176210984,I have similar thoughts. I feel as if it’s best to treat it as sz because I feel it’s easier to cope that way. Cause there are methods for easing anxiety and fear and panic that can be learned through therapy. I feel as though therapy makes me stronger against these threats whether they be real or not. Because it teaches me how to deal with them.

If it makes you more comfortable to say that I don’t have schizophrenia, then that’s what you need to do. For me it’s a mute point. I came on this forum and found people who understood what existing in an alternate reality felt like. Secrets I have kept for years and years could be openly discussed here. I didn’t self-diagnose. I thought I had Autism. When I was diagnosed with sz I was shocked and thought it was too extreme. And then I started reading about it and so many things fit. And then I came on this forum and met people like me for the first time in my life. I used to get upset when people on here told me that if I’m functioning without meds I must not have sz, because they were basically rejecting me from the only community of humans that I relate to.

Then, lay spinach leaves in the bottom of the bowl, put tomato slices on top of that, then mozzarella, then back to spinach and keep layering until you run out of ingredients. If I want to make it extra tasty I finely dice some red onions and throw on top along with some vinegar dressing. There’s also a simple salmon meal I enjoy. You need spinach leaves, thick salmon filet slices, and red pesto. Put the leaves in the bottom of a pan, lay the salmon on it, and slather the salmon in red pesto. Put in oven at 200C for 20 minutes, I swear to god, it’s gonna be the juiciest fish meal you’ve ever had."

Participants self-completed three validated questionnaires: (i) Australian Eating Survey, (ii) General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire-Revised and (iii) Yale Food Addiction Score Questionnaire.Thirty participants (mean age 19.7?±?2.5?years) completed the study (10 per study arm); 43% of the energy intake was obtained from energy-dense, non-nutritious foods
, higher than the recommended upper limit (<15%) and the levels reported in the general population (35%). Mean diet quality score was 33.5?±?11.8 of 73. Mean food addiction symptom score was 3.3?±?3.7. Prevalence of food addiction was 37%. Nutrition knowledge was lower in the FEP and UHR participants than the depression/anxiety group (48.2?±?13.8 and 49.5?±?8.2 of 88 respectively); however, this difference was not statistically significant.Unhealthy dietary intake was observed in the early stages of mental illness, likely seeding future poor physical health. Further research is needed on the role of food addiction in this population, including effective intervention techniques.

She doesn’t understand that its been 10 years, since my diagnosis, that I am staying in bed all day everyday. She refuses that I am disabled and have schizophrenia."

If i had a pound for every time someone said “are you alright?” in the pub i would be a rich man. Trouble is - you start to worry more - cos youve been found out - and its showing on your face lol. Pure bloody paranoia - i know it, but not being able to drink makes it harder. Cos i know damn well, if i sunk a couple of scotches - i wouldnt give a toss."

176211064,"I wrote anti government propaganda for a year then I started to notice things. I noticed classical conditioning everywhere related to me. If someone coughed in a red shirt everyday of the week I would notice; then I started noticing people in red shirts following me, it’s like I was conditioned over a week to the color red. That’s the process. Now it’s just a ton of conditioning out of control. I believe I pissed off a rich person who has connections, so now my mind is just trodden down with delusions."

176211073,"My psychiatrist said I make false connections in my brain, I felt offended by that. I think he meant delusions. I used to cling on my delusions and believe them but now I just get lost in my delusions and hence can’t cling on or believe them. I think meds do that by weakening working memory but not sure."

Well each person thinks it’s the other guy. Well I gotta tell you, I think I’m the bad guy and it sucks. The guilt over this is eating me up inside. He’s such a nice person and I hate doing this to him. I did say it was forever. How was I to know my feelings would change the way they have? Well there’s nothing that can be done. I guess I just have to be the bad guy. It’s hard though."

A job would be necessary and I’d have to be around what I would perceive to be blabber-girls and cancerous guys. Can’t let people know you have paranoid sz, because they can dismiss any valid thing you say with “he’s paranoid, he needs to take his medication.” My solution: Tell all my friends to get out of my life. My friend here thinks mental illness is like finding the missing piece where everything will fall into place. The right place for him and people like him is far, far away from me. Uh-oh, intrusive thoughts. Better do my prepared routine to fight back and make as big a deal about it in my head as humanly possible so that it 1. doesn’t help and 2. becomes a ritual.

If I were you, I would find another therapist, he can transfer your new documents over to the next therapist. I wouldn’t like him after he did that to me…"
176211089,I just realized that some of my thoughts were wrong. I was able to recognize some of my beliefs as delusions and change my thoughts.
176211090,_AT_MENTION_ I’m so sorry to hear that. Did she give you a reason why?
174396502,"What goes up must come down. Can sugar, excessive exercise, drugs etc cause mania? Then when the crash comes its not just a chance event but a neccesary one. I don’t think changing diet will solve all your problems in a day but honestly Im schizoaffective and am barely ever manic anymore since I started eating balanced, exercising balanced, quit drugs etc Some people have a natural disposition to be kind of revolutionary and cause change in society, but I think bad health can exasperate that into being something unhealthy"

176211094,That’s absolutely fantastic!
176211095,I can empathize with you _NAME_. I used to get taken for a fool that results in an easy laugh when I lived with roommates and all in the name of me being a nice person which they happily exploited. I’m still a good guy at heart but my tolerance for people’s crap isn’t very high. Your neighbor sounds like a real ???? pot.

176211098,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ That’s what I did. I also looked in my diary, but there’s nothing that matches with these checks… I am a little less anxious now. I think some stores I went broke up their credit card machine, so I had to do checks. That is the only likely reason. (Obviously it’s also possible that my checks were stolen, but I don’t think so.)"

176211104,"well, sometimes a little something helps get us through our day, like a smoke or coffee. personally, i don’t have a problem with a couple cups of coffee throughout the day. and iim trying to quit cigarettes because i know smoking is bad for me. it’s your call, if your life is better or not without these substances. i have also stopped drinking alcohol, about 3 weeks now, and quit weed, 6 years and going. but i have little that helps me throughout the day, without a couple cups of coffee or an occasional smoke."

176211123,No its not easy - but just try not to treat the date too seriously. Its harder for us Sz’s - cos we have the added difficulty of managing the crap that comes outta our brains as well. Have fun. I hope it goes well for you. And dont put yourself down - your both equals.
176211124,Im gonna guess and say your probably not. Could just be simply anxiety? We all tend to be a bit over-senstive with our emotions when we are given a psych diagnosis.

174396509,"From my limited research I found precedent for all of my own symptoms, both positive and negative. However there is an element that still bothers me and I would like to receive clarification on. In the span of around four months, four related people started to hear voices and experience delusions, the usual positive symptoms. First it was my biological mother (in her mid fourties at the time), then my uncle on mother’s side (in his fourties) and then me, around 20 years old. The uncle has three sons. The middle son (my cousine I guess??) suffers from mental issues too, but I lack data. So far as I know he did not show the usual positive symptoms. All my relatives and me went insane after meeting and speaking to one person in particular, a young woman who rented my room when I studied abroad. She did “magicks” and probably continues. Of course I suspect it was something different now, years later. I met scores of “witches”, “warlocks” and schizophreniacs in my life previously, and I su
ffered absolutely no ill effects, until that time. That is a lot of people who were affected in relatively short span of time, at most three months. All of them are close biological relatives. Is it enough to explain the insanity? P. S. I have hard data and witnessess to trace these events, so I myself am rational when I present this particular problem."
176211138,If you uncover what’s Behind a mystery You might not like it. Think _PERSON_.
174396518,"yea changing meds is hard. There always is the chance you get off them or lower the dosage and you’ll react badly and then it might be hard to get back to a comfortable level. I think it’s pretty brave of you to want to try it. And yea, if you are in a hospital then it’s the ideal situation to try it."
176211139,Nice beat _AT_MENTION_ ! The drums are a bit too fast IMO

176211144,"Came back ok. I don’t think they wanted to kill me then. I thought there was a family of them having a look at me and an elderly lady with a younger woman, she stopped and stared as I was running by.

176211152,"Many , many people on this site have told you that it’s a delusion. I’m not sure what you are looking for here now. You maybe need to change up your meds (probably Clozapine) and probably get therapy. Posting the same thing over and over here is not going to get you anywhere."

I’ve heard that you should limit it to one, but I have a lot of temp jobs on my resume so it takes up space to list all the skills I have. You should make profiles on Indeed.com and LinkedIn. I get messages from employers sometimes from Indeed, and I connect with people I know on LinkedIn. Whatever helps! Good luck!"
174396524,"Certain things God doesn’t want us to know. I believe they can do certain things like this but it’s evil and wrong and very unlikely. I read a good book on it. A lot of my schizophrenic delusions are based on the montauk project. I thought the aliens or government were seeing through my eyes back in 2015 and possibly 2016 and it was in the montauk project book written by _NAME_. They talked about _NAME_, the psychic being able to go into other bodies. I dont recommend reading it at all. It caused some anxiety/paranoia for me. I cannot explain it but the antipsychotics really help as well as therspy!!! I think you are delusional and need help because it’s very unlikely and the logic of what you’re saying doesn’t make sense to me, largely. I believe I have at least one microchip possibly in my brain. I was told this in a past life…I have no clue what it’s there for. I dont like it one bit. I hope I dont upset you."

176211162,Commitment and stability. A feeling of safety. Divorce is still possible but there’s a lot of activation energy to get that going. Keep below that level and things will be fine for a long time. Your partner can’t just have a crazy whim and walk out on you without consequences.
176211163,"my not buying alcohol has really helped me. im not responsible enough to buy beer or wine, because i don’t ration it when i do, i end up drinking most of the bottle, past the point of no return, its just something i learned about myself, that it’s best for me, if i don’t buy any, and only drink socially like 1 glass of wine with dinner when it’s given to me. i just like to sip it slow, takes me like 30 minutes to drink a glass of wine. a bit relaxing, but no buzz or drunkenness. if mom and dad stopped drinking i would have no problem going without. i went a year without it, a couple years ago. i used to spring for a bottle of wine about once every 6 months and would drink the whole thing. i would wake up in the morning thinking they should bring back prohibition, to save me from myself haha."

176211171,_AT_MENTION_ You don’t need to apologize. Maybe you had a shi**y therapist. My friend got a lot out of DBT because she got the written info on it plus weekly sessions with a good therapist. That’s why I say they can offer insight

I do much better when I keep normal hours."

I’ve been placed on this specialized diet because of physical health issues like a fatty liver and diabetes but I’ve noticed improvements with my moods as well. I’ve been feeling less depressed since following this diet. I’ve also lost 11 pounds since lowering my carb intake.

Studies on cell cultures and animal models have shown that long-term antipsychotic use is linked to both an upregulation of dopamine D2-receptors in the striatum and the emergence of enhanced receptor affinity to endogenous dopamine. These findings have been hypothesized to contribute to the phenomenon known as dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP), which has been clinically typified as the foundation of rebound psychosis, drug tolerance, and tardive dyskinesia.’ PubMed Central (PMC) Antipsychotic Induced Dopamine Supersensitivity Psychosis: A Comprehensive...

174396552,"My apologies again for the late reply. Long story short my laptop needed to be replaced and I’ve been on my phone again. Had trouble finding the topic. I do not have blood work regularly done for Abilify. I did however have blood drawn in a laboratory about once a month when I was on injectable medications. The medication I remember taking with lab work done several times a year was the Invega Sustenna injection. I would rate that the second most effective medication for me personally. It did have several drawbacks and withdrawal from it was a horrible experience. After that the Risperdal Conzta was also effective in treating symptoms for me. Prolixin would be a distant third however that one gave me tremors and other bad side effects such as chest pains, I may have some allergic reaction to it. Because of the tremors, it was discontinued. One thing I should point out is that I felt fine on it for the first two months or so. After the third month of biweekly injections, my body began reacting neg
atively to it. Another thing I’d like to add, with injectables, I could sometimes feel a burning sensation coursing through my body especially after the first 3 to 4 days of being injected. The reason I usually opted for injections is because I didn’t feel I could trust myself with pills, partly because I likely would have .missed too many doses for it to be effective and also because I was in a state of constant suicidal ideation."

Both of those areas are at the core of the negative symptoms. Overall the brain benefit of mindfulness is an increase in grey matter for the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus, contrasted with a decrease in grey matter for the _USER_ID_. Of course, you can add compassion training and that will increase the size of the right _USER_ID_. _NAME_, translated “Loving-Kindness” is the official name.

Hippocampal volume reduction is now one of the most consistent structural abnormalities found in schizophrenia: it is present at the onset of the illness and, to a lesser degree, in first-degree relatives of schizophrenic probands. Decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate point towards a cellular basis of such volume changes.

If all I end up doing are covers and maybe I can both educate and turn people on to an artist they’ve never heard of, that’s good enough for me.

This study aims to investigate symptom patterns that could predict TRS using a discovery/replication study design. First, we followed a cohort of inpatients with schizophrenia (n = 164) in which the most discriminative items at baseline of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were determined using logistic regression with TRS status as an outcome. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, we tested the prediction performance of multiple combinations of the identified items. The same items' combination was tested in an independent replication sample of (n = 207) outpatients with schizophren
ia. In the discovery sample, the best combination to predict TRS at the discharge was the sum of three baseline PANSS items - conceptual disorganization (P2), difficulty in abstract thinking (N5), and unusual thought content (G9). The P2 + N5 + G9 model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.881, a sensitivity of 77.8%, and a specificity of 83.3%. In the outpatient sample, the model P2 + N5 + G9 predictive accuracy for TRS was only in the range of ""acceptable"" with an AUC of 0.756 and sensitivity of 72.3% and a specificity of 74.4%. Overall, the P2 + N5 + G9 model corresponds to the construct of formal thought disorder composed of disorganized thinking, concrete thinking, and bizarre-idiosyncratic thinking. Pronounced levels of these symptoms are easily identifiable in clinical practice and may be a feasible strategy in TRS. Replicating in first-episode cohorts is desirable to understand the likely clinical utility."

Could possibly begin through a series of online surveys to try and discover common themes between the experiences of those suffering from sz. And supplement it with data mining posts from forums like this one to basically harvest written language by those who have this illness and then attempt to identify how “dellusional” each post is (if at all). _USER_ID_: A preliminary assessment should be pretty straight forward and inexpensive that will allow us to quantify the expected cost of the actual research + build cost.

d get funding from. Pianogal: Thanks for your feedback. What do you think about an alternative take on this idea - basically an “Early Warning Sign Detection App”. Doesn’t explain how it detects the early warning signs to users. However the way it would work is as a kind of “dead man’s switch”.

In early Western thought, _PERSON_ idealism held that all things have such an ""essence""—an ""idea"" or ""form"".

176211447,I’ve found from here we are all different and react differently to meds. I gained on risperdal and my function was poor. Got off to move to zyprexa…was worried because all I ever read was about the weight gain so moved to abilify. That really didn’t work out though I tried it for two years or so…back to zyprexa. So. Moral of this story. I’d say it’s more about function than anything else. The weight gain might not be as severe if your more motivated and thinking better…That is my take on it.

174396611,"Intracellular says it helps some negative symptoms. Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc. Intra-Cellular Therapies Presents Data on Symptom Improvement by Lumateperone... The Investor Relations website contains information about Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc.'s business for stockholders, potential investors, and financial analysts. Specifically related to social function. The data presented at ASCP included analyses from our schizophrenia studies (‘301 and ‘005) showing that lumateperone selectively improves this critical negative symptom domain of emotional experience compared to placebo. Importantly, these results are consistent with previous data that demonstrated improved social function with lumateperone as measured by the Personal and Social Performance Scale. It does target many of the old familiar neurotransmitter systems, but also ones not (apparently) covered by current meds. Lumateperone is a potent 5-HT2A antagonist, a mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine phosphoprotein modulator (DPPM) with pre
-synaptic partial agonist and post-synaptic antagonist activity at D2, a glutamate GluN2B receptor phosphoprotein modulator with D1-dependent enhancement of both NMDA and AMPA currents via the mTOR protein pathway and an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. Probably the most important new feature though is that it had a safety profile similar to placebo, with no cardiometabolic or movement side effects. Of course it’s going to work for some people and not others. After all, not even clozapine works for everyone. It has finished phase 3 and word is expected from the FDA by the end of August or so."

176211464,"I have organized the games the voices play into three categories: Repetition - they will take a single word out of a sentence I have thought or said, and repeat it over and over again. The point seems to be merely to be annoying and distracting 2a. Out of context. They take half of a sentence out of context of how it was intended 2b. Dual meaning. The first example that comes to mind is, when I think to myself “I’m going to lie down on the couch”, they repeat the word lie over and over again, as if to suggest I am a liar. This is how I perceive it anyway. It’s like game 1, but more targeted Eliciting an emotional response. Like if I’m watching a movie and there is a touching moment, they will say “Aaaaahh…” in a mocking fashion. Like all the games they play, extremely childish I have gotten to the point, where I label and categorize the game they’re playing… I simply say to myself “that’s game 1”, and dismiss it. It allows me to come back to Center much more quickly"

I know that you’re probably really terrified at this point, and I was too. It seems like you are in denial. Your parents are certainly not out to get you. That is a delusion and you need to be on medications to help manage those symptoms. I know that it seems too scary to accept but if you treat your psychosis now the better you’ll feel on the long run. I used to get those delusions too and I was horrified. You should talk to your doctor about these thoughts and ask for help. Your doctor knows best on what to do. I am not an expert on schizophrenia/psychosis/sza. I cannot emphasize this enough- the earlier you’ll get treated the faster you’ll recover. Please remember that you are loved."

If I was just me on my default setting, which is very self-centered (autism literally means self-ism or the state of being oneself), I might actually push people away. So I have to work at it.

176211493,"“Ego” has only really become a “bad” or negative word over the past few decades. With _PERSON_ it is usually defined as “the centre of consciousness” and is an unavoidable facet of the human being. I personally don’t see Jungian psychology as saying that the ego is a facade or pretense. He does use “persona” in that context however but “ego” is something higher than the persona, though “ego” is usually still far away from “Self,” which _PERSON_ considers the transcendental, universal, and highermost part of our being. He admitted to have been inspired to use the term “The Self” after reading the Upanishads, the Hindu scriptures which focus on the realisation and discovery of the Self (“Atman” in Sanskrit) which in Western terminology we would also call the spirit or more recently the “Higher Self.” Anyway, since “ego” just literally means “I” it cannot be a bad thing, since every one of us has and is an “I,” an individual entity possessing self-
consciousness. In philosophy and metaphysics, “ego” was only used as a positive word for a long time and was often a synonym for “soul” and used interchangeably with it. Such a thing as egotism and egomania is certainly possible but ego itself is neither good nor bad. Every time we say “I” we are essentially saying “I am an ego” and how can that be a bad thing? But please know _AT_MENTION_ that I’m not disagreeing with any of the points you’re making, other than that I thought they are actually describing what the Jungian system calls “the persona.”"

174396633,"There’s hundreds of genes on chromosome 22 that make protiens, and I guess probably many more that don’t. What’s so interesting is that this research used a MAM model, where they give a toxin to pregnant rats or mice at a specific time in gestation. These were not rodents where they knockdown one specific gene and then restore it. So this toxin has a variety of effects that are similar to effects seen in schizophrenia. And then they use viral-mediated gene transfer to restore inhibitory signaling in the vHipp by over-expressing the ?5 subunit of the GABAA receptor in pyramidal cells. We found that ?5 overexpression increased _USER_ID_ GABA currents and normalized aberrant pyramidal cell activity in the vHipp. Just that one subunit just in pyramidal cells just in the vHipp. So they’re getting down to very specifc targets and finding which cells and circuits correspond to which symptoms. With a therapy like this you might not have to know what kind of mutations led to someone’s schizophreni
a, or if it was prenatal problems, if those problems affected the pyramidal cells of the ventral hippocampus, something like this might substantially normalize the dopamine system. In this experiment it also restored one aspect of cognition. In rodents. They’ll have to continue experiments on different circuits for different symptoms."

176211529,Rest does help. My therapist says the biggest thing other than sleep is to stop making decisions or choices for a while. I sometimes tell my husband that I’m taking some time off and he’s in charge of all choices for about 8 hours. This includes trying not to do tasks because your brain still has to put the steps in order and choose things. I find it helpful.

To taught me, they would show something on the tv that is related to what i had just been talking about. At the moment, i’m in the suspicion phase. I don’t always feel comfortable around the tv, but i can sit down and watch something."

I was always very laid back because of all the exercise I got playing sports and doing sports training. everything would just roll off my shoulders. I also liked to travel. I have seen most of the united states and been to almost all of the major cities in the states. also went to Ireland. I never paid any attention to politics before I got sick, but have started listening to political talk radio in the last year or so. my intelligence was probably slightly above average but nothing special. I have always had a hard time figuring out mechanical things.

176211552,I feel if your pdoc supports you with your decision and monitors you then its worth discussing… My pdocs over the years have helped me to come off although I’ve decided to go back on them due to some mood issues … Im off them again with their help but now I’m having to go back on a different med because I still have issues

To tell you the truth, I would chalk your experience up to a delusion myself. I had some weird pseudo-religious experiences as part of my delusions. On the other side of that, I find it very difficult to reconnect with God at all. I wonder if maybe things like _NAME_ of Tarsus’s conversion moment on the road to Damascus, for _NAME_’s visitation by the angel _NAME_, these could theoretically have been the result of mental illness."

I’m over it… but I had to move on weakness and my next job was in retail banking opening checking and savings accounts/clearly not a fit for me. I was having a quarter life crisis and was doing ballroom dance(I didn’t see myself as having no rythym/having a coordination disorder) but they liked me a lot and offered me a free trip to Puerto Rico. The bank wouldn’t even let me take unpaid time off for it. Probably the least sexy job in the world. I guess the point is pain is pretty universal.

Like, when my grandpa dies, he will go to hell unless I promise to take his place. But it?s not grandiose. I?m not some special savior. It?s just a human soul for a human soul. Or maybe I?ll go to hell and he will rest in heaven, no sacrifices. And don?t I deserve hell, since I?m failing at being good? But intent matters, doesn?t it? I mean, I thought God was supposed to be forgiving. I don?t want him to go, but I know he?s ready. My mom wants to watch TV alone, even though it?s our thing. We always watch TV together. This is the 3rd day in a row that she?s promised we?d watch TV together, only to talk about how tired she is in order to ?trick? me into letting her off the hook. It?s very obvious what she?s doing, but I play along anyway. I get that she?s tired, which is fine, but the issue isn?t her not wanting to watch TV. No, the issue is her set
ting a specific time to watch, allowing me to get everything ready, only to call me downstairs when I text her at that specified time to ask if she?s ready and moan about how exhausted she is (or, as in what happened last evening, calling me downstairs only for her to tell me that she took a benadryl because she was ?tired and anxious?). If you don?t want to watch TV with me, say that you don?t want to watch TV with me. Don?t string me along, having me thinking that we?re finally going to spend some time together and talk about something other that my grandpa?s illness, the hospital?s negligence, the insurance company?s ridiculousness, or our problematic financial situation. No one really cares what I want or need. They never do, until I end up in crisis. In fact, I?ve been told on more than one occasion that I can?t have another crisis because the family wouldn?t be able to handle it, as if I just woke up one morning and decided to have an episode because I wanted some attention. I am the rock; insightful, c
ompassionate, and forgiving, easy to trust, and even easier to rely on. But people are only really interested in me when it benefits them. Outside of a handful of this forum?s members, I have no friends. Not a single one of my ?friends? from high school has ever returned a text or call, and you can bet your ass that none of them have ever attempted to contact me first. Even the one person from this OCD chatroom that I considered to be my best friend pretty much disappeared out of thin air as soon as the stresses of college were over. I suppose I really do walk alone . So here I am, sitting in this room with no one other than my gassy dog, with the light off and my phone _USER_ID_ on because that?s the way she likes it, waiting for the inevitable. My grandpa has a small chance of making it, but I think this is the end. Damn? 86 years? That?s a long ass time. May he rest easy."

I think all humans fit this template, not just sz. Fear and love didnt work for the image i was drawing so I changed it to happy/sad. The eyes were initially drawn as knives, one hand being attacked by one, the other being defended. But that made the happy face look evil, not happy, so i simplified it. I also wanted to show a running stick figure instead of standing to imply motion; that we are all beings of change. Also, how we move through a world of darkness and sometimes find love, sometimes fear…that darkness is the same but each person’s interpretation of the discovery will have different and even opposing meanings to them."

174396689,Hey _AT_MENTION_ . Basically having schizophrenia and a drug problem too decreases your life expectancy to 47 according to the statistics. Try to stay clean (and sober if possible). Drinking while on seroquel is also a big no-no as far as I know.

Feeling unloved and unwanted is painful. When I was bullied and isolated I used to cry why does nobody love me.i had apathy back then.was very heavy. _NAME_ hay says to say affirmations to yourself such as “I am loved””I love myself “”my parents love me””I forgive my parents “etc I’m trying to do this now. I’m closer to my mum than my father as my 
father still doesn’t seem to think I deserve much good etc I had a abortion when I was psychotic and I love my son.even though he is dead I still love him and see him as my son.i love his father too.i regret having a abortion but I was hearing voices 24/7 ,being threatened and I could not even take care of myself and my family told me I have no choice in the matter and I was not strong enough as such to stand up to them . I am a beloved child of the universe is another affirmation that is advised. I am still reading this book but am trying to say affirmations and forgive everyone including myself etc. Try giving yourself the love you feel you didn’t get. Take good care of yourself."
176211740,This guy that I was dating owes me nearly £2000. I don’t think he will give it back and I asked him yo pay it to my mum not me. At first it was out of loneliness that I decided to lend him 20 pounds here n there but then I started to get scared of him. Sucks big time wish I never met him. He was showering me with so much attention but was at the same time getting my money. But wen he asked for money he was so annoying and scary wen I said no. So I can relate to the loneliness thing. Cos that’s how mine started off. I sympathise with you. Only mine got out of hand I didn’t even want to give him money anymore but I was so scared just having come off my meds and feeling so so paranoid of this guy. How sad wat I got myself into. I hope you come across a nice Friendly guy who you don’t need to pay any money to…

I’m nearly 36 and dependant on my husband financially and to accompany me in the car as I don’t have licence and I never really had a job - just a casual job for a few months before I got married but my depression and avolition made it hard to show up regularly. I still have bad avolition can’t even write or paint regularly and struggle to keep house properly clean. I don’t socialise either - just want to withdraw from society.

174396704,"Welcome to the forum! It’s okay that you’re trying to find a logical and valid explanation to why we hear voices. So many of us have tried to find a way to say we have telepathy, truth is at this point telepathy has not been proven to be real without using some sophisticated technology. The only empirical evidence of the possibility of telepathy involves using a technological headset. The experiment involved using symbols to guide another person in a sort of video game. I’m sure if you Google it, you’ll find it. With that being said, it was impossible without the headset. So as far as science has explained telepathy without any external means is impossible. I know many of us would hope it turns out we are telepathic and not all that ill. It sadly is not so. I’d advise you to follow through with proper treatment involving medication and a licensed psychiatric professional because if I am to be 100% honest, a lot of what you’ve mentioned appears to be word salad or gibberish.

an to offend you. It just doesn’t seem like a coherent train of thought. Don’t get me wrong, I too would rather be a misunderstood telepath than a schizophrenic. It just isn’t the case and encouraging delusions is against the rules. Again, sorry if I come off as rude or am a little too blunt.

176211774,I’m game and I hope others will be too. You can do it for free using a program called Sculptris. Sculptris may not load if you have Windows 10. Another non-free program called ZBrush will be needed then. Both programs are made by the same company(Pixologic). _AT_MENTION_ has already downloaded Sculptris and will join this thread. I am using ZBrush 2018 since I have Windows 10. All forum users can use the link below to download sculptris and in this topic we can post our work and also help each other out when we get into trouble with the art or programs. Hope to see ya here! Get Sculptris and here’s a sped up version on how to draw a fancy human skull in Sculptris. I also recommend these videos for noobs to digital scultping. Sculptris Just watch the first video for a start and then jump into the program. You can watch the remaining videos once you are ok with the basics of Sculptris.

Increasing evidence links air pollution (AP) exposure to effects on the central nervous system structure and function. Particulate matter AP, especially the ultrafine (nanoparticle) components, can carry numerous metal and trace element contaminants that can reach the brain in utero and after birth. Excess brain exposure to either essential or non-essential elements can result in brain dyshomeostasis, which has been implicated in both neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs; autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDGDs; Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyot
rophic lateral sclerosis). This review summarizes the current understanding of the extent to which the inhalational or intranasal instillation of metals reproduces in vivo the shared features of NDDs and NDGDs, including enlarged lateral ventricles, alterations in myelination, glutamatergic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, inflammation, microglial activation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered social behaviors, cognitive dysfunction, and impulsivity. Although evidence is limited to date, neuronal cell death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction are reproduced by numerous metals. Understanding the specific contribution of metals/trace elements to this neurotoxicity can guide the development of more realistic animal exposure models of human AP exposure and consequently lead to a more meaningful approach to mechanistic studies, potential intervention strategies, and regulatory requirements. Keywords: nanoparticles; particulate matter; inhalation metals; trace elements; brain; neurod

176211788,"No. There is a lot of false information here. Emotional Support Animals are NOT the same as psychiatric service dogs. Emotional support animals do not need any special training and don’t need to be dogs. ESAs are no longer allowed on major airlines. Many stores are cracking down on them too (Target). A Psychiatric Service Dog is a Service Dog and is subject to a different group of laws. These are allowed on airlines and stores, etc. All Service Dogs (including Psychiatric ones) need to be trained to perform specific tasks to help with the handler’s specific disability. To have a service dog, you do not need a Dr’s note. You legally only have to train (or have trained in many cases) the dog to be housebroken and perform specific tasks to help with the disability. You must be able to communicate this information with employees of the places you bring it. You are not required to give out any other information (including a Drs note). Plus my opinion: Poorly or under trained ESAs spread a bad name 
for psychiatric service dogs, and all service dogs for that matter."

First, I announced my full name to people around me who didn’t believe I was me, and I was in another reality. Then I stopped a girl from stabbing someone by taking the knife out of her hand. Then I spoke to God who was a black man, and he was just listening. Then I jumped out of a window, and like in the Matrix I levitated at the end, and stood on the ground, while I saw the nature of reality was all just a sort of illusion. And it was the most amazing feeling, because in the dream I was told there is no death. And I felt amazing. I have such symbolic archetypal dreams. And we don’t fully as humanity comprehend consciousness. I would love to experience more of these ascension type dreams. And if schizophrenia is like a waking dream, perhaps I could transform my more archetypal delusional/non-contextual exp
eriences and immerse myself into a more spiritual life. The theme was courage, courage and strength. And I am a highly spiritual person. But I don’t want to be fooling myself, and that’s why I posted here.

176211916,"Hello? I?m a newbie. I don?t really like making post online, but I?ve been feeling bad lately? I was diagnosed with psychotic depression around 4 years ago. I don?t really remember what happened but I was laying down on my couch and I couldn?t get up because i was so scared and paranoid. My thoughts where really bad that i felt i needed to go to the hospital. I couldn?t tell my thoughts from voices? Then i was prescribed risperdal or something? It made me sleep 16+ hours a day and i hated it. I stopped taking it shortly after i got out of the hospital and only took an antidepressant + therapy. A few months later, all of a sudden the psychotic symptoms disappeared. Like in an instance. I was really relieved? but it was so fast. Everything i felt before felt fake. I didn?t even remember what it felt like to have psychotic symptoms. So i thought maybe i never had it in the first place? that i lied or something strange like that. 3 years later today, im feeling extremely terrible. I get these bad thoug
hts that Im being followed, being controlled and that everyone hates me because im evil. I dont know whats happening to me because ive never heard of something like this happening to somebody. What if im actually faking it like i thought? I dont think i would ever go to the hospital again because it was expensive and scary. Sorry if this is all jumbled up, im terrible at typing.

I somehow don’t expect anything to happen within the next 4 months partly because the echo simply did not go off like normally. That being said, I have heard of primal scream therapy or something of that sort. Some say to scream into a pillow and what not. I feel a bit relieved but also I would have liked to yell in a better spot that would have provided a bigger echo. I guess I am a schizophrenisaurus at heart and sometimes feel the need to roar. The only thing is I was facing South a bit. _NAME_, hopefully it doesn’t affect Mexico or South American countries. Heh. Anyway, I hope to be rid of the delusion."

176211960,It’s a slippery slope. A lot of it doesn’t need any decent science to be validated by serious study. That is a problem. Some supplements really can be dangerous so it’s important to read good sources especially on the internet. I’ve found a different antidepressant to help with both those problems so it’s also important to give yourself a chance with conventional medicine. It’s expensive because it’s been through a much bigger and inclusive process…Supplements don’t have those safeguards and the internet will tell you otherwise.

Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind.

176212042,"Heya _AT_MENTION_ Risperidone 3mg right now, been on this dose for a few months now. I still have voices, but they aren’t as loud, don’t have as much sway on my thinking. Aren’t as powerful, while on meds. The meds help keep me from having major episodes where I think I’m talking to angels, and get confused about what’s real. My voices have stages, depending on how far down the rabbit hole I am. They start as whispers I can’t make out, easy to ignore them. Second level sounds like a crowd, or noisy restaurant, I can’t make out what they are saying, but I know they’re talking about me. Deeper down, I can start making out what the voices are saying, they pick on me, say derogatory things, try to command me. This is about the time the walls start breathing and moving, gravity feels weird, and I start seeing things. True hallucinations are the final step, I lose touch with what’s real, the crowd turns into angels, reality fades around the corners, the world changes, I lose myself, the 
sky will change colors, everything moves, confusion and fear, booming angels commanding and judging me. Telling me I’m the chosen one. It’s all a very strange process. But that’s the best way I can describe it,"

176212062,"Hi does anyone here think I have schizophrenia? I have real bad physical symptoms. My concern is that I’m believing I have things like MS and schizophrenia, but I haven’t been diagnosed with either. Am I delusional, I think so yes. I mean I dont want to be thinking and believing these things, but they are strong beliefs within me. I’m not getting why I believe these things, especially if docs are telling me, I dont have them. My days are clumsy and awkward, is that a symptom of schizophrenia? Being unbalanced and awkward? And annoyed with oneself because I cant do much nor do I want to right now. I’m sleepy a lot, need to nap every day. I do not hallucinate or hear voices, but my thoughts are not normal, are they? Sometimes I think my neighbor’s are recording me and watching me, told my pdoc all this. Maybe I’m imagining things. I’m not sure somataform disorder fits my symptoms although it has all my symptoms too, but the meds I’m taking are not first line treatment for somataform d
isorder. Just lately my pdoc says I have treatment resistant depression, but I’m depressed due to my physical symptoms. One is bound to be down and out, having a woozy head every day, and not being able to cook, clean nothing because my focus and concentration are gone too. It’s all just strange because I feel my body is not mine, I mean it won’t do what i want it to do, if you can understand. Cant function properly at all. It’s so debilitating and frustrating. I’m taking more meds than most, and not getting better so obviously the zyprexa will take time to kick in, but I certainly don’t want to be stuck to the chair with it, hopefully it will help boost me not debilitate me further. Anyway just thought I would ask you guys what you make of me. Am I displaying schizophrenia type symptoms? Thanks"

176212077,"We had a meeting today at work. My supervisor had told me last Wendsday but I forgot. So I walked into work this morning and two of my co-workers remined me. The building has a really nice auditorium with dimmer switches and tier seating and a big screen for slides for the soldiers meetings. No one knew what the meeting would be about but ten of us were siting there waiting as an important woman from human resources and her assistant told us it was about sexual harassment in the workplace. It’s a touchy subject and everybody was sitting there really serious looking. The human resource lady set up a screen so we could watch a DVD about the subject. She looked up and announced ""This is a DVD to train you on sexual harassment. I thought about it for a whole hundredth of a second and than I blurted out, “You mean it’s going to train us on how to sexually harass someone?” It’s a serious subject and the atmosphere was serious but most everybody there started laughing. Now it’s after the fact

Literally I have never felt anything like that before. The closest way I can describe it is like when you get a horrible flu like withdrawal from taking cocaine. (Going back a bit) I think it was akasthisia, but whatever it was I literally could not take it. By time the mental health team got involved, it was a urgent referral (4 hours) and I was so out of it after quitting cold turkey, that they kindly said come to the mental hospital or we will force you.

But, someone threw me 6 feets away and I landed on the back of my head. I wonder whether it is because of that reason I couldn’t acquire skills later in my life. My obsession here is whether I can acquire skills or not should I reverse the deficits in Executive functions. Your situation implies that this is just consistent with this illness when it happens earlier in life. So, there is hope. It will reverse. I think. Which medications are you on? If you don’t mind me asking? Unlike you, I think cognitive decline happens because of the symptoms. This happens when the illness goes untreated for awhile, thereby creating a loop and worsening the symptoms further. If you aren’t able to focus in depression, the brain, or the Executive Functions, worsen because they aren’t being utilised. When the symptoms go away, and one c
an focus, the executive functions can reverse with extra effort. The brain is a muscle. It is plastic. I am referring to your other post in which you indicated that Schizophrenia is fundamentally a cognitive illness. I think the other way around: it is a symptomatic illness."

My big advice, trying to remember 7 years ago, would be five or more alarms, coffee, and forcing yourself to be physically active during the day. I had a physically demanding job to keep me up. Napping or even just being inactive will lead to not sleeping at night, which will make daytime sleepiness even worse. Sleep longer at night if you need to. I still do.

174396765,"Well, let’s just say I didn’t read the book or watch the movie, but I sometimes feel like I’m obsessed with _NAME_ and his books and films. I really don’t have an idea what it’s about except the vague, overall concept, that there are things or “people” manipulating our reality for some unknown reason or benefit. I’m not trying to cause a rift or controversy, I just want to tell my story and talk about some of my strangest dreams or experiences as of yet. I’ve been having what I think are very lucid dreams that are so real you can mistake them for the daily reality we all experience. So real that it’s like sleep walking yet you’re sort of awake and aware. I think I’m a very interesting person and have a lot of great, although strange, ideas. I feel like I have a lot to say and talk about here. Basically, I think I died like two weeks ago (not sure on the exact day) and that I came back alive thanks to the ‘adjustment bureau’ for lack of a better term. It could have been l
onger for all I know. 6 months, 6 years? I have no idea. Basically, I’m stuck repeating my life over and over again and only I have free will – I think. We might be living in a computer program, but I don’t care – at all. I really don’t. I’ve learned not to care about simulation theory or aliens or whatnot. I sometimes go against my gut instinct because talking is therapeutic despite the threatening thoughts in my head that tell me to shut up or else. As someone with slight paranoia, I worry that I’ll reset someday. If I reset, I’ll go back to like 2010 or 2011 – I think. I’m not sure on the exact date. But I’ll have to relive the worst experiences of my life. The worst of the worst psychosis. This has happened millions or billions of times. I believe in freedom and freedom of speech. I believe I live in the greatest country in the history of humanity. Before I went on psychiatric medications (Vraylar and Cymbalta), I started thinking I was an immortal. And that I did die and either I re
surrected in a slight, but different parallel universe or that the greys resurrected me and that they are tired of me and are freaking pissed off at me and want me dead. I’m scared of them. I feel like I have psychic dreams when sleeping or that I have recall when I’m awake and thinking or even smoking some cigarettes. It’s like I can time travel or go through different dimensions or universes while asleep. Stuff that should be theoretically impossible even for a super advanced alien civilization. That my past is being manipulated so A) I can’t remember or B) I had no past C) Something else. I sometimes have thought I was a machine or something. I sometimes doubt that I have schizo-affective disorder because there is no physical proof of the condition, just observation from a trained professional. I sometimes doubt mental illness even exists, that maybe it’s something else like a virus, aliens, or the polluted environment and the food and drinks we consume. That my diagnosis keeps changing and no-on
e has a freaking clue what I have. That I have serious doubts about it. People say it’s because I drank energy drinks or took supplements. I can’t even remember my life before 2010 or something. It’s like I didn’t exist or reality didn’t exist. It seems like my mind can ‘access’ technology or something when I’m thinking or dreaming. Like I did see a video of myself on my computer with aliens and such and other stuff, which made me think I used to be a computer simulator, ie someone running this machine that we call the matrix or reality. I obsessively think I was cloned countless times and that I think about the Illuminati too much, that it’s a conspiracy theory with no evidence and that they are bad people. On a positive note, I stopped watching conspiracy stuff months ago. I tried alternative platforms like twitter and youtube but it just didn’t work out. I feel like I can’t make it sometimes that the odds are against me. I feel like I have a lot of important, original ideas but becaus
e of who I am or because of my ‘delivery’ or lack of fancy or flashy equipment or graphics, I cannot get a following. I can only relate to two groups of people: the autistic people and the schizophrenic ones. I have a grandiose delusion that I was one of the smartest people on the planet (lol) and that I need adderall because of ADHD or some ????????. That I’m a test-tube baby or was grown in a lab. That I was experimented on countless times. I keep having these stupid thoughts (obsessions) that I have schizotypal autism or some ???????? that doesn’t even exist and that it was an ‘artificial’ disease that was given to me through genetic engineering in a past life for unknown reasons like to increase my IQ or something. And that I have a photographic memory for certain things which is why I can recall stuff no one else can. I constantly think about the TV show “Westworld”. I freaking love it. I sometimes think reality is sort of like that. That we’re just biological machines or puppets inside 
a simulation or something. I do have some vague memories of such things but I also have some information that counters this idea. I also think about aliens like reptilians and that I may have a little bit of reptilian DNA or something. And that some people I’ve met while sleeping or dreaming are actually reptilians… I don’t mean to trigger anyone. I hope everyone is doing alright. These are my legitimate thoughts and concerns. I think I plan on seeing a psychiatric nurse in a couple months or something instead of a psychiatrist. I’m moving up in life. I sort of feel embarrassed posting this crap.

The BBB is formed primarily by the presence of tight junctions (TJ) between cerebral microvessel endothelial cells. In light of the known effects of nicotine on endothelial cell biology, the specific effects of nicotine on the in vivo BBB were examined. Using in situ brain perfusion, it was found that continuous administration of nicotine (4.5 mg free base x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 1 and 7 days led to increased permeability of the BBB to [14C]-sucrose without significant changes in its initial volume of distribution. The expression and distribution of the TJ-associated proteins actin, occludin, claudin-1, -3, and -5, and ZO-1 and -2 were analyzed by Western blot and 
immunofluorescence microscopy. Though no changes in total protein expression were observed, nicotine treatment was associated with altered cellular distribution of ZO-1 and diminished junctional immunoreactivity of claudin-3. It is proposed that nicotine leads to changes in BBB permeability via the modulation of TJ proteins. ""Using in situ brain perfusion, it was found that continuous administration of nicotine (4.5 mg free base x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for 1 and 7 days led to increased permeability of the BBB to [14C]-sucrose without significant changes in its initial volume of distribution.

176212133,My biggest regret is leaving my x boyfriend in sa and the dogs. It was pretty perfect home and relationship and ones I love most. I left the one I love most because I wanted to give my horse a better paddock and I wanted to stop eating meat. My other regret is having a abortion when I was psychotic with voices 24/7 etc. My family told me I have to because I couldn’t look after myself even. The father was best sex ever and I wonder if we could have made a family and be happy but I was soooo psychotic and was hearing his mum etc and had paranoia against them.

176212151,"I might migrate this topic to a spiritual forum that I am a member of so I can speak more freely. However, it is relevant to SZ in my opinion. There are two key components, seeking attention and apathy, which both are connected to the SZ condition. All people have these two components to some degree, but with SZ they can be extreme. Certainly when I am paranoid I seek attention in an extreme way, indeed even when I’m trying to ignore people I seek attention because I put myself in situations where there are people about until it becomes unbearable. In fact, I don’t so much try to ignore people as change their behaviour so that they stop giving me the wrong kind of attention which is what makes me paranoid. Thus it is the type of attention that makes me ill, and I am always seeking the right kind of attention as part of my condition. What I would love is to be self-contained, happy with myself, and more than this, encouraging to myself, motivating myself to do things through self-encouragement. 
At present, I still need to announce my self-encouragement to the world at large. And this is what I believe is ostentation. My ego doesn’t encourage me unless it is expressing itself to others. To express itself directly to myself with encouragement is what I want to start doing. Thank you."

176212168,"I’m not sure whether I have psychotic depression or sz, but it doesn’t matter right now because it has taken every once of life that I’ve had with in me. It’s taken everything from me I have such long lasting episodes that it isn’t even funny and over the course of the years I feel like I’ve lost my family and all of my friends I used to be so creative and I loved doing things but everything I made and sketched out everything important that I had I threw it all in the trash I was trans and stopped being trans because people made me believe I was some kind of prophet and that my family was soon going to kill me. I think the thing that makes me even _PERSON_ is that I feel like I’ve lost myself I can’t go outside anymore because of paranoia, I can’t do certain things because I feel like people are watching me all of the time. I keep thinking about high school and how the people I knew want me dead I hear there voices in my mind and keep thinking I’m being controlled without my med
icine I get so bad I drove so many people away and I hate myself for what I’ve done during that time I had hallucinations with the nightmares I had and lost track of time it was so horrible and terrifying I’m still a little scared from that episode and if there’s one thing I’ve learned from this it’s that I hate myself and I hate having psychosis I’m always trying to escape but somehow it’s like a loop, I don’t know what to do because my life feels ruined I feel like giving up and just laying here in my room all day."

176212173,"In last post I haven’t written so much about my coincidences, so now I describe them more. 14.10.2018 I saw a film in which there was fighting with certain monsters which have two-word Polish name. First part of their name has the same first two letters as Polish word for shampoo, in addition, last three letters in the first part of the name of creatures from the game are the same as last three letters in Polish name of shampoo. In late 2018 or early 2019 (I do not remember when it was exactly) I typed English transliteration of the name of a creature from Russian game again (it is other creature than that which has Polish name somewhat similar to Polish word for shampoo) in the search engine and coincidence with shampoo happened again! In descriptionthird link in results there were two words “shampun” (a sort of English transliteration of Russian word for shampoo) and one word “shampoo”! So the coincidence with shampoo became larger. In X 2018 I nicknamed shampoo “V” in certain forum
. Probably in late 2018 I looked at comments in certain dictionary and earliest comment was about the word which has the same first two letters as Polish word for shampoo and fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh letters in it were the same as third, fourth, fifth, sixth letters in Polish word for shampoo. In addition, twelfth or similar comment was about entry named V! Legend of Big _NAME_ was coincident with “legendary legend”, “Dear _NAME_” and also Big Hole. Big _NAME_ - first word is the same as first word in the phrase “Big Hole”, second word has the same number of letters and the same second letters as the word “Hole”, so there is a coincidence. Text from screenshot of Giant Egg encounter is also coincident with Big Hole. After “You see:” two words appear: first “Egg” and second “Hole”. Word “Egg” has the same number of letters and the same last letters as the word “Big”, and second word is “Hole”, the same as in “Big Hole”! Coincidence is obvious. In addition, words 
“egg” and “hole” occur in the sentence between two “You see” phrases, first the word “egg” appears, after it appears the word “hole”. “Egg” and “hole” are the only nouns which repeat oneself in the screenshot! “Hole” appears three times, “egg” two times. I saw film from another game which was very similar to Russian game with Big Hole. Two first locations in that game are very coincident with Big Hole! Both have two-word names, first words have three letters (like the word “Big”, consonants are first letters in them, vovels are second letters, like in “Big”) and second words have four letters which are very coincident with word “Hole” - one of these second words is “Hole” and second differs only in one letter from the word “Hole”! Amazing!"

Jan 2019-October 2019 no meds but had my third psychotic episode. Got sectioned two months. Came out December and relapsed after a week. Got sectioned for another six months. Came out in June 2020, and stopped the anti psychotics after 8 months on Paliperidone, then clopixol then olanzapine. I was ill whilst on meds during my last hospitalization for about five months. I was delusional and hallucinated a bit."
176212182,You could start by something as easy as mowing grass. Idk what your budget is for starting a business or if you have one but if not a great thing to do would be to go down to home Depot buy a cheap lawn mower (gas or electric) and go door to door offering to cut grass for $30 let’s say or whatever. Hit up 4 houses in a day that’s 120 in your pocket pretty much. If you’re looking for bigger scale you could start with gardening and planting that sort of thing. Idk what your experience is like. I think some people get jobs at landscaping companies work there for a few years then open their own companies after a while. But you could easily specialize in one thing…grass cutting…sprinkler installation…grass restoration and replacement…the world’s your oyster lol

176212198,It’s a hard one but I’ve learned that some people you can’t change. If they aren’t willing to listen or make it all about them then it’s hard to keep trying. Just be kind as you can and respectful but ultimately most people have to save themselves.

174396789,"Hi there! I will tell you my own experience with the illness… On the beginning of it I spent 1 year and a quarter without any social interaction, it was super hard and dealt with it very badly… I did stupid things thanks to my one and only psychosis and I regret it not taking the meds or attend my doc… After I got back to college I was still a mess socially, just after 4 years talking to my mates and friends I started to regain my social skills - I’ve lost touch with one or two thanks to them doing drugs that I don’t want to. Although I’ve talked to them once or twice a year, but it’s not the same, you know when people use drugs usually they have thoughts of superiority among the ones that don’t use it, it’s awful… With that said, even with my improvement in social skills I still have trouble talking when I’m not fine, but I do an effort to overcome it and try to be a good friend. Even if I’m not talkative I still listen and give my honest opinion. I’m lucky to have one or 
two friends that still talk to me and made 2 more on college. We all have flaws and no one is perfect, but I consider them good persons and I’m lucky to have them. Now, the science stuff - scientists have been researching the role of complement component c4 (gene c4) and their expression on chromosome 6 - you know mutations on this gene could be due to genetics or external factors. Maybe how people are affected by this illness could be due to their mutations on this gene. This finding was very recent, it only has almost 3 years, so there isn’t a lot of studies yet to find the full extent of the consequences of this mutation. National Institutes of Health (NIH) – 27 Jan 16 Schizophrenia’s strongest known genetic risk deconstructed Suspect gene may trigger runaway synaptic pruning during adolescence – NIH-funded study. With that said, hope you’re surviving this exams period, I wish you the best on your internship and you can talk to me whenever you want"

It’s just that you chimed in that day too, were the only one to do so, and you asked me point blank if I was ok."
176212208,WTF are you talking about?
174396792,Im not schizophrenia i only had an psychotic episode so im sure its invega causing all these
176212209,I thought that people were watching me because they were jealous of me and wanted to see me being tortured. I have always been the type to have myself together and I had big dreams.

What could i do to overcome such weird thoughts and imaginations? something small and constructive that can progressively help me? For example, i might think that i get into an accident and get severely injured, or i am caught by police and will be fined but i do not have the money to pay, some one get badly injured because of me, someone shouts at me for reckless riding, etc… Listening to music or some books while riding does not seem to improve the situation.

I had vivid hallucinations of disks spinning around the room, and when I asked other people if they could see them they said they couldn’t… I had terrifying hallucinations every night until about the age of twelve, and then my symptoms disappeared for years. They came back later around age 24 but this time took a more paranoid approach. I felt like I was always being watched, everyone could see me and hear my thoughts, my hands were no longer in my control, the tv was harassing me constantly, that I had been micro chipped and had a camera inside of me etc… Now I’m on meds.

It started in 2002, I thought my son was dead and that everyone was just going along with pretending he was alive because they knew I couldn’t handle the news of his death. He was just 8 months old. It was very hard to take care of an infant that I thought was dead. But the thoughts would come and go. I did what I had to do to take care of him and freaked out about it later. It was really sad. I didn’t completely shake the delusion until a few years ago. He’s now 19 years old. Then it happened again to me when I worked for Social Services. I thought the people in charge were conspiring to withhold benefits from beneficiaries based on their race or life choices and it infuriated me. When I ended up leaving that job it was out on disability but not before I wrote a 13 page letter to the State detailing all the rules they were breaking and laws I had seen committed. When I left the Director told my coworkers not to take any of my calls because I had gone crazy. The St
ate sent and investigator out but no charges were brought. I still have a hard time with it but it must have been a delusion."

176212239,"If I take meds, I’m too tired to take care of my kids. If I don’t take meds, I’m too crazy to take care of my kids. Do I give up parental rights of my kids?"
174396798,"I had awful anxiety. Couldn’t be in a store alone, etc. Always needed my husband qith me. Tried _PERSON_’s mane and it took away anxiety I’ve had for years"
176212240,"When I was on Invega I only cried once during two years. Not even at a funeral was I able to shed tears. Then they took me off invega and put me on something else, and within days I had shed more tears than I’d done for several years prior. Now I have days where a song is enough to make me cry. Other times, I cry when no one sees me to let out some overflowing emotions, usually frustration."
174396806,I’m on Invega and Abilify. I have low bloodsugar from my pain pills we think. It drops to around 50 a lot.

176212246,My pdocs understand. Most of my nurses have understood. Only very few therapists have understood and that’s why I don’t use counselors or therapists. None of my family have ever gotten it. Except my son and he was sz.
176212247,I wonder how you expect others to treat you when you have sz yourself. I wonder what your delusions are and how your husband puts up with them…
176212248,It interacts with my Depakote. There is a major drug interaction between Lamictal and Depakote! My psychiatrist prescribed me the Lamictal and she reassured me that I would be fine but the pharmacist called me up and warned me of dangerous drug interactions between these two drugs! I have to be on the Depakote but I might be able to substitute for Lamictal. What would you do? Would you listen to your doctor or the pharmacist? https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/depakote-with-lamictal-918-_PHONE_NO_.html

176212254,I have the same problem. I will think about doing something artistic or play a video game or do chores and most of the time I just sit staring off into space thinking “well I could/should do this…” and literally am like blocked from doing it. If I force myself to sit down and do things (I use to enjoy) I loose interest very fast (5-10 mins) and then it seems like work and not fun. And I go back to literally sitting in silence for hours.
176212255,that’s good at least
174396807,"Im a bit conflicted about this… I strongly believe in a link between diet and psychiatric issues for some patients. I have seen convincing research and I have been recommended by a doctor to do an elimination diet because I have psychiatric + GI issues. And I know I felt better when I changed my diet. But I just think we really don’t know much about it yet. And I know I’m a bit vulnerable to eating issues…whether it is quitting food altogether in psychosis, to finding some miracle diet and sticking to it for 3 days or 2 weeks and thinking im cured, to giving up because i lack discipline or forced myself into such a strict diet that it is impossible to stick to, to reverting to a junkfood diet. I think the first step for me is eathing a healthy, diverse whole food diet again."
176212256,"I think this is out of order. I know I am taking an anti-depressant, but he did not tell me he was going to inform my GP that I have depression. I just thought it was low mood and temporary Did not even see him face to face, and this is diagnosed over the phone Also there is no date for next appointment and my old pdoc used to keep me informed. He sent me pages and pages of links to all sorts of organisation and charities to contact for help. So angry"

174396816,"Above of all,there are different between 2 terms: 1- Determination what is the nature of sz nature in itself as it comes and felt by person with Sz 2- Definition the schizophrenia nature by personal linguistic expressions After you know its nature I know the nature of sz nature,the ID of the pathogen,its functional characteristics, the nature of its effectiveness,the mechanisms of effect step by step ,the result of effect which represented in the things that you call it the symptoms of sz …etc so it is easy for me to tell what is the definition of the sz condition by my personal linguistic expression without single mistake ,so what i say is true and corresponding the actual realities of the sz condition The question; Do you know the nature of the sz nature ? You were said ""sz does not definition involve malignant feeling and thoughts "" This statement is just personal impressions be said without realistic knowing the nature of the sz nature ,it is not a facts corresponding with what the person w
ith sz feels/perceives and there is no scientific experiments to prove the credibility of the personal impressions . So your statement is diagnostic question do not diagnosis the internal events,processes or any mechanism (it is personal impression no more ) From the other side,say what you want ,you cannot hurt me by the words , because i interested only with the realistic facts"

I reported no symptoms at all, and he left to talk to my therapist about committing me, leaving my case manager with me. I have big plans this weekend and I cant afford another hospital stay. This was about 2 hours ago, I’m afraid the cops are going to show up at my house since I ran away from the pdocs office because they were talking about hospitalization. _AT_MENTION_ I asked him about atropine sulfate and he wouldn’t give it to me. Today has been a day from hell, my whole treatment team is against me, all they want to do is see me being hospitalized. Said 200mg clozapine is too low, and I need to be monitored when they increase the dose. They just want to see people drugged up, its bullsh*t"

In other words PSR approaches are strengths based–they are based on the assessment of a person’s strengths as the basis for individualized goal setting and recovery. This is a major difference from traditional, illness-based approaches which focus on problems and deficits. I thought when I read that hey my psychologist might be doing that, but the opposite.

When she was fading away I got to tell her how much I loved her and how much I could feel her love from here. Those were my last words to her. My aunts and uncles told me she understood because she loved me so much. Don’t feel bad tho. I’m sure you being by her side will out-weigh any regrets you may have. None of it is your fault anyway."

This one is so persistent because it feels so real. Also sometimes I feel like the idea that there is a place for me in this world where I can be loved & seen & accepted just the way I am is a delusion.

When i first got the injection it felt like i was falling, it made sleeping very weird because id wake up in a jolt. Anyone get an injection and take pills with it? How did it go?"

I went to college, got 62 credits, worked at Mcdonald’s for 3 weeks and made breakfast burritos. I was fired because they were “too good” and then everyone was ordering in massive quantities that I couldn’t keep up. The boss fired me and said “Fast food wasn’t the right industry for you” so yeah she was a biatch. Tried a job at Goodwill and told I didn’t care enough to deserve a job, and that I was over-dressed. Tried to get a job at Waffle House. Waffle house is intense, the training was like bootcamp. Now it’s a pandemic and I was planning to go back to college to finish an associates but that was 2020 and my PELL Grant expired in 2020 so I get no more money for tuition I guess the schools claimed it even though I never attended class and withdrew before the deadline. I got accepted to a bunch of colleges but that was 10 years ago and I’m not 
sure I have the desire to spend money on school because it was deprived of me and the opportunities just constantly crushed for some reason or another."

This all seems suspicious. You really need to stop looking up whatever it is that is leading you to young girls! Because yes, you can get in trouble if you keep running into young girls all the time. Sometimes cops have pics and profiles out for sting operations and will ensnare people who actively seek young girls. That said, if this was a one off viewing, accident through reddit, and you didn’t try to contact the person, you’re not going to get in trouble.

A _PERSON_ hazard model with metabolism-related diseases as time-dependent covariates was adapted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of cataracts between SGAs and FGAs groups.During the 8-year follow-up, patients receiving SGAs were associated with a higher risk of cataract than those receiving FGAs with an adjusted HR of 
1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.06-2.36). Patients receiving high-metabolic-risk SGAs (clozapine and olanzapine) showed the highest risk of cataracts among SGAs when compared with those receiving FGAs (aHR?=?2.57, 95% CI: 1.35-4.88). SGAs demonstrated a stronger contribution in the risk of cataract in patients without diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemia than in those developed these diseases. Patients who developed DM or hyperlipidemia after receiving antipsychotics had an approximately 2.5-fold increased cataract risk over those who did not develop these diseases.Regardless of the condition of metabolic-related diseases, SGAs were independently associated with an increased risk of cataract. DM and hyperlipidemia developed after antipsychotics contributed to the risk of cataract risk."

176212484,"I’ve been taking this stuff off and on for the last 10 years. One of my roomates in college recommended it. https://vibranthealth.com/info-hq/green-vibrance-complete-overview/ I used to eat like garbage in my early 20s, before I got sz, so I started taking it to get some vegetables in my system. I wouldn’t believe all the reviews you see on amazon, but this stuff has been around for almost 30 years, so its probably not complete quackery/woo. It is pricey though. After I took it for a couple years, I started eating better on my own and ended up dropping 45 pounds. I’ve been stuck there for the last 3 years due to not exercising though. It does keep my mood more stable when I’m taking it, but everyone is different and it could be placebo. I’d say try out the sample packs first before you buy a jug because some people won’t like the taste/texture. You can usually find it cheaper on ebay or vitamin shoppe when they have coupon deals.

I’m curious to know that if you have any experiences of being bullied or abused as a kid, I do, and my theory is that meds do make such “hallucinations” go away but what if people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are only too receptive and can be an easy target of mean ghosts?"
176212508,"Tbh my thinking was smoother today for a few… But it just showed me how i spent decades in thinking mostly bull**** , being tortured by paranoid thoughts, which were causing pain even in my body etc… Is it common to have a screwed up thinking in sz? Its sad … I had no the smallest idea what to think on the reality for years. I just had some sick beliefs, who were making me acting not appropriately… My pdoc was saying, that i cant think, cause i have mostly paranoid thoughts, but i guess its up to me now to fix that, cause the meds never fixed my thinking or the paranoia… Did you fought the paranoia by your own too mostly? Its a bit tiring this lonely struggle… I hoped in the past, that my meds will make better my thinking and the paranoia, but i have to work on my own on this now i find… The bemol in my case is, that i was sick since very long, so to feel better it’ll be harder now… Hugs to all"

This is why from that state doing a useful activity or remaining in a needed state feel almost impossible as present state is all what in the mind.

176212601,well if you dwell on these existential Ideas your always going to verge on what could be seen as delusional. A lot of normies think about these things too. theres a gazzilion things on the internet to basically support any idealogy you can think of. rings of saturn? oh thats actually satan? oh evil creator? oh… and on and on it goes. I think its a problem if your completely engulfed and obsessed with it because it affects your day to day living. If you are not harming anyone or listening to voices commanding or telling you about stuff like this then I think its not a huge deal. Its when you it affects your life and others in a bad way then it is not good. normies have delusions too.

176212604,"I feel I have really made good progress in learning how to overcome my stressful work. This is what I have learned helps me. Have routines, and make sure they are relaxing. I have the same little routine I do every morning before work. I get up a little bit earlier than I actually have to so that I don’t have to rush myself to get ready. I can take my time, enjoy my breakfast, watch videos on the internet. Make quiet time for yourself. Every day before going into work I take a 20 minute nap in my car. It is my time of peace before the storm for me to gather myself up and prepare for what’s ahead. Take your bathroom breaks when you need them. Take your meal breaks. I even use my time pulling meds as some quiet time for myself to decompress. Have mantras. I have a little mantra I say as I do my morning routine. As I move through the various parts I say “no one can ask anything of me right now” and just that statement gives me so much relief and peace. I also like to tell myself “Not everyda
y will be a bad day”. I think in the beginning of my job I had constant anxiety that each day would be as horrible if not more horrible than the last. It helped me to realize that some days will be more stressful than others. Share what you’re going through at work with others who understand. This means coworkers! My therapist was the one who encouraged me to reach out to my coworkers and it has helped me tremendously. Not only do I get more support by voicing my struggles but I have found that many others are thinking and feeling the same way as me, incredibly overwhelmed and having trouble practicing self care, and it made me feel less alone and took away that feeling like I was just incapable. Those are the biggest things that helped me. What helped you guys when work stress got bad, for those that work? summary: Give yourself enough time in the morning to not have to rush and be stressed before your shift even starts, take your breaks and don’t be afraid of taking a couple minutes to walk away and j
ust breathe if things get too intense, have positive uplifting statements that have meaning to you that you can repeat to yourself throughout the day, confide in your coworkers and support one another or at least find someone who works in the same career as you to vent to.

176212606,"I wouldn’t recommend going off meds without some kind of health strategy. Meds act as a kind of buffer for reducing the inflammation of a bad diet.

176212608,Is that why youre hallucinating? If so that might be kind of a good thing because that would mean the meds are probably still working Either way I would get that refill as soon as possible and then let the pdoc know what happened
176212609,"I literally thought that a certain show had me in it. I remember how disconnected from reality i was getting at that time. Then i stopped watching tv and the like until my meds kicked in.

Similar to e=mc^2 , c should be a constant relating to gravity in each direction meaning both positive and negative, similar to aplying force or letting go. If you think of gravity or mass atraction then perhaps 0.97 should be used in to calulate mass, and otherwise 0.152 im going to see If i can find some real life examples later."

176212622,"A long time ago when I heard a voice that sounded like my mothers voice,I tend to think now it was her higher self. She called to me very lovingly when I was in a dark place, but a larger part of me disbelieved it even though I was welcome to such an experience. Because of that its like I cut myself off to it. It’s just one of those ‘wild beliefs’ that not many people in this world will get. That’s fine… I get it. I don’t need to be accused of being ‘crazy’ for something that doesn’t even hurt anyone. I take care of myself to the best of my abilities and am fine for the most part. It’s not until people start being forceful against such ideas that I can get defensive and put in a dark place again. So chill out. We’re all in different places in our understanding about things and you can’t honestly pretend to know everything yourself to say what IS and what isn’t. I could say I’ve felt or heard other presences too, but in no way do I find that ‘debilitating’ to be consi
dered a ‘disease’. That’s a matter of personal perspective/opinion. And again, you’d be coming from a place of pretending to ‘know everything’. It’s just a feeling. And there’s nothing wrong with feelings. Far too many people are too rigid with their thinking minds and it can make you especially egotistical and arrogant. It doesn’t feel good. So I don’t know why people even go that route for long… It hurts you more down the road than being open and relaxed."

176212728,"Looking forward to getting off soon and working part time. I have to make at least that much for food and rent. I don’t judge people at all for it. I actually think people who get SSDI deserve it, while I’m on SSI and just got it because of my disability and being an American here. Over the years, I realized it’s nice especially for the first ten years. It changes people. Not something to gloat or be proud of being on, but it keeps some people from being homeless or worse. I thought about paying it all back plus some some day but then it dawned on me, they gave me schizophrenia, so it’s the least I should get. I mean I sometimes feel really bad and feel like this is some sort of fascist bullcrap. I have an entitled feeling towards my dad who worked 30+ years at the same job and he tells me he earned it and my step dad who tells me it’s a choice – the disability and not doing anything. My mom wants me to be safe as well as my dad. So not being homeless or worse. Basically have a place to 
stay with some food. The rest is extra or not given or expected… After 10 years of pure suffering from schizophrenia and DP/DR, I have come to a point where I think I can work part time 20+ hours a week at min wage which is 13 an hour here maybe 14 depending on the company. That’s about the same as SSI but I have to figure out insurance and pay for my meds that keep me sane… I had a nice life once and it all came tumbling down. I often feel teary eyed and feel like crying but meds cause me to not cry and I just feel really sad and emotional when I bring up past life memories which seem real… Part of me (some days) makes me think or question or believe I created Bitcoin so I already paid my dues but it’s probably not true. Maybe I think something and then convince myself or believe it. I don’t know. Something isn’t just right. When I dream, I remember programming it in another dimension/parallel universe under some sort of alien mind control… The money isn’t mine and I don’t want it. It sho
uld go to the government. But I want to be left alone with my thoughts. Getting schizophrenia at 22/23 years old in 2011 gave me 100x more empathy and compassion and sympathy for others. Perhaps, I was a narcissist or something before. Now, I am not. Something changed me and I did a 180 in life. I realized I took life for granted and had it all and was lucky before I lost it all and became disabled."

176212800,what does it mean?
174396930,"I have no positive symptoms just negative and cognitive symptoms. The main cognitive issue I face is distractability. For example if we count notes and if some one interrupt then we loss track of counting and we need to repeat to make sure its correct. In my case this kind of distractability occurs in everything. For example when washing hands suddenly felt like some dirt fall on hands and I need to repeat washing and so on… Negative symptom can also be emerged from this issue. For example if I do some needed things then some other thought come then that reduces the interest of previously doing needed things and thus feel like anhedonia. The interest intensity quickly reduces. Everything feels like impulsive whether the thought or signal is useful thing or not, real or imaginary, true or false."

176212808,"As in the present era use of wireless networks is increasing day by day and the electrical devices are getting smaller; both factors expand the research area of Wireless Body Area Networks(WBAN).The devices used in WBAN can record various physiological parameters like the body temperature, the BP or to take ECG, EEG, etc. With the use of WBAN, a patient experiences a greater physical mobility. The patients need not stay longer in the hospital as WBANs are placed on the human body and often transport private data; Security is considered as an important issue. It will in turn increase the quality of patient care and the productivity of hospital staff. Field of Wireless Body Area Networks comes up as a major research area in past few years as it is beneficial in health monitoring even in remote areas and patient’s care can be done in real time. However, if the security of patient’s data is concerned with WBANs, design issues should be taken care of. In the present paper, a short review on various

176212843,"Yesterday, I found an article that proposed a simple method to stop arthritis pain. https://www.viome.com/blog/reversing-arthritis-personalized-diet speaks about a sugar, Neu5Gc, found in mammalian meats and milks that causes chronic inflammation. To clear your body of that sugar and free yourself of the pain, you need to eliminate that particular sugar from your diet for 1-2 months. That means avoiding all cow, pig, goat, sheep, and horse meats and dairy products. Chicken, turkey, duck, eggs, and seafood don’t contain that sugar so are OK (seafood tends to be high in heavy metals so eat sparingly, however.) The web is spotted with testimonials of people adopting a vegan diet and becoming free from arthritis. I imagine Neu5Gc avoidance is one of the main reasons for this. Also, the manner in which vegan foods make the body more alkaline may be another reason. I’m on day 1 of this kind of diet, and I’m not in a lot of arthritis pain right now. I had a glass of milk yesterday though, and had an 
arthritic flareup. That was my last glass, I imagine. I’m going to post more natural arthritis treatments here as I find them."

Unfortunately, Parkinson’s is a progressive disease and your father’s condition will likely worsen over time. He may need home care services helping your mom out with him or eventually he may need to be in a full-time care nursing facility. Try to take care of yourself and find ways to reduce your stress. Also gently encourage your mother to make time to take care of herself and to try to reduce her stress levels when possible. Ask her to speak with a social worker to figure out the various levels of care available for your father as he will eventually need care beyond what your mother will be able to provide."

It was a punishment commonly used by the Romans. I’m a little put off by the belief that we are all innately evil, and it is only because of God’s infinite mercy that even a few of us are saved from eternal hellfire. God covered us with nerve endings, gave us a belly that needs to be filled, and gave us a sex drive that torments us more than it benefits us. Does that make us innately evil? Granted, people do a lot of rotten things, but I don’t think eternity in hell is something I would wish on anyone."

In the U.K. you access your pdoc via a nurse usually. I am gonna ask the nurse if she could mention this to my doc if she happens to see him. She can’t authorise the med cessation herself. In the U.K. has to be a doctor I think. Question is is speaking to my nurse about this inappropriate? I don’t want her to feel pressured to take responsibilities regarding meds - it’s not her job.

174396972,"I don’t know if it’s me but any drug I have tried for alogia has either crapped out or has short half-life, leading to me taking it throughout the day. Maprotilline (kind of works, yet you have to find the right combination of AP + Maprotilline for it to work; plus it made me really angry and exacerbated my positive symptoms); Memantine (worked for ~9 hours a day, but I think it crapped out after 10 days on it, although I’m not 100% sure); Coffee and energy drinks (various forms; work for various periods of time – from 1 to 5 hours; I think it craps out for me from time to time, although, again, I cannot be sure as I change meds pretty frequently; could be interaction) Sertraline, a moderate DAT inhibitor, improved my talkativeness although it came with nasty side effects such as anger, irritability and feeling too energetic. It’s a risk/benefit ratio. Sarcosine which is the safest of these substances, worked pretty similarly to caffeine (1-6 h), with added benefit of improved mood and so
ciability; call me crazy but I think the usual dose I was taking crapped out after 6 weeks and I had to up the dosage; not sure what can be made up of this. Various other substances that work at NMDAR receptors; with the exception of sarcosine, described above, they can be pretty spotty, in that sometimes they work and sometimes don’t; but possible as an augmentation therapy, if combined with other NMDAR agonists."

But I was amazing with the patterns, I put them together in 2 seconds or 3 seconds. No ink blots so Im not sure what test it was. I had to list words that went into sentences and repeat phrases backwards and forwards. I thought I did better than I scored. I think 110 is average. I took the HS GED test though about two weeks after being released from the mental hospital, and I didn’t even go to HS for the past two years so I obv. have some higher functioning if I was able to almost get a scholarship for the grades I got on the GED.

I thought the same way as you do until I noticed a guy here at the group home with no money, car, or place of his own have more than one girlfriend. He just had a way with women. Money is definitely not everything. Sex isn’t either. The memories that are the best concerning women with me now is when I was spending platonic time with my nieces, my sister-in law (twin’s wife), and the times I spent talking to a pretty girl at a place I used to work at. Perhaps the best moment was seeing the sights of Washington DC with my sister-in-law. We had a memorable time. She belongs to him but I have enjoyed her company. I once wanted to make up for the incident with another guy when I was 11 by having sex with a woman. I have dropped that idea now. If I ever did I’d want it to be for a better reason.

This was in the 1980’s, so it was alot of money. Nearly 20 years later it still helped i reckon - when i presented myself homeless to the local council.

I never used to engage with anyone about anything and hid all my illness because I was so paranoid about what the government might do with me. Now I understand these people are just trying to help. I have given up my resistance now as I grew tired of the constant relapses and taking time off sick from work.

The problem with racism isn’t primarily the relatively few people who actually hate people of color. People of color deal with discrimination and injustice all the time in their daily lives. There is a kind of racist rhetoric in western culture that fuels all this, and that is excused or trivialized mostly by people who haven’t themselves felt the consequences of racism.

176213062,"You have to come of it really slowly. Standard advice is to reduce by 10% of your previous dose every 4 weeks, but that may not work for you, for example you may have to go slower and reduce by 5% every 6 weeks, or maybe you can go quicker at 15% every 2 weeks. You have to see how your body reacts and make a judgment call. Eventually you may reduce down to 50% of your dose but can’t go any further, so hold that dosage for a few weeks or months, then start reducing again when you feel better. Coming of benzos isn’t easy, don’t be in a rush and take your time. By the end you will be chopping your pills into tiny little pieces and taking those for months. Eventually, after about 6-8months of reductions you may be able to quit. It’s along process for most people. Quitting Cold Turkey can result in seizures and death."

176213130,"Cognitive impairments are a core and persistent characteristic of schizophrenia with implications for daily functioning. These show only limited response to antipsychotic treatment and their neural basis is not well characterised. Previous studies point to relationships between cortical thickness and cognitive performance in fronto-temporal brain regions in schizophrenia patients (SZH). There is also evidence that these relationships might be independent of symptom severity, suggesting dissociable disease processes. We set out to explore these possibilities in a sample of 70 SZH and 72 age and gender-matched healthy controls (provided by the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)). Cortical thickness within fronto-temporal regions implicated by previous work was considered in relation to performance across various cognitive domains (from the MATRICS Cognitive Battery). Compared to controls, SZH had thinner cortices across most fronto-temporal regions and significantly lower performance on 
all cognitive domains. Robust relationships with cortical thickness were found: visual learning and attention performance correlated with bilateral superior and middle frontal thickness in SZH only. Correlations between attention performance and right transverse temporal thickness were also specific to SZH. Findings point to the importance of these regions for cognitive performance in SZH, possibly reflecting compensatory processes and/or aberrant connectivity. No links to symptom severity were observed in these regions, suggesting these relationships are dissociable from underlying psychotic symptomology. Findings enhance understanding of the brain structural underpinnings and possible aetiology of cognitive impairment in SZH. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-021-00149-0?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+npjschz%2Frss%2Fcurrent+(npj+Schizophrenia)"

176213133,"In my honest opinion, diagnoses are just categories of symptoms lumped together that tell doctors how the best way to proceed is. That’s why diagnoses change as new symptoms are discovered, and why so many keep being mis-diagnosed. Two people can have the same problems, but those problems can have different causes and different solutions. And I’m wary of pushing for an ASD assessment, because if I move back to Scandinavia at some point, it will make it harder for me to get accepted for medically transitioning."

174397030,"The types of bacteria mentioned are: Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus helveticus Lactobacillus plantarum L. casei B. infantis, B. longum L. fermentum, L. acidophilus Some interesting bits: C-fos is an immediate early gene and it’s changed in the expression has been directly associated with disorders of learning, memory, cognition, psychosis, etc [107-112]. _NAME_ [113] reported that probiotic treatment was able to restore the hippocampal c-fos expression in mice exposed to psychological stress. The combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus helveticus have been shown to improve the c-fos expression in the hippocampus and associated memory response [81, 114]. C-fos is one of the direct mechanisms involved in the homeostasis of the altered brain biochemistry by the probiotic strains. BDNF is one of the well-conserved neurotrophic factors studied to date. Dys-regulation of BDNF expression with decreased serum and plasma levels of BDNF protein has been seen in an array of neuro
-degenerative disorders as well as psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy etc [85-89]. _PERSON_ [90] recently showed a direct link between the up-regulation of brain BDNF levels by probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum IS-10506. Besides this, additional studies also show the evidence of the ability of probiotics in up-regulating the BDNF, stimulating the gut-brain axis while promoting brain development differentiation, memory and brain plasticity [91-93].BDNF is capable of exerting a positive effect on the gut-bran axis through butyrate production that can be used as an adjunct therapy in cognitive impairment associated with old age. Butyrate is a Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) that has another effect on the suppression of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are heightened in various mood and psychiatric disorders [94-96]. Intestinal microbiota produces a substantial amount of this SCFA in the human gut [97-99]. Butyrate also increases the expr
ession of a very important antioxidant enzyme (Glutathione, GSH) which helps to decrease the oxidative stress one of the neurodegenerative factors to be considered. HPA axis acts as a major endocrine system that consists of three components: the hypothalamus; the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland. It plays a key role indirectly being involved in neurology of an array of mood disorders, such as anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, insomnia, major depressive disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome etc . It has been reported that most of the antidepressants help to regulate and restore the HPA function [64, 65].Studies have reported that repeated or chronic stress leads to hyperactivity of the HPA axis with elevated cortisol levels especially are seen with people suffering from psychotic disorders, major depressive disorders, bipolar disorder [66-69]. HPA axis activation appears to have a prognostic value and is associated with an increased risk of depression relapse and even suicide [66
, 70]. Therefore, one of the targets for intervention, therapy, must be an agent capable of restoring and normalizing the HPA axis which gets altered in different neurological disorders. Studies have indicated that many lactobacillus species ( L. plantarum, L. helveticus,L. rhamnosus, and L. casei) and Bifidobacterium species (B. infantis, B. longum ) are capable of significantly reducing the heightened HPA axis by decreasing the cortisol (CORT) and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels … neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-Hydroxy tryptophan;5-HT) that play a key role in most of the mood and behavioral disorders and chronic depression episodes have been altered and restored to their normal state by probiotic strains. Among the indirect pathways, it was found that certain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria strains enhance the precursor of 5-HT that is serum tryptophan [121, 122].Also, most probiotics are capable of altering our immune system limiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines lev
els (IL-6, IL-1, TNF-?.) and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) which have a direct effect on the nervous system as these pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with IL-2 and IL-1?, are key participants in depressive states and other affective disorders [51, 54, 123-127].These immune-effective probiotics were L. plantarum, L. helveticus, L. fermentum, L. acidophilus, B. longum, and L. rhamnosus ."

Why does she think therapy will help me more than increasing my medication? Why does she hide Talking about my diagnosis? What even is my diagnosis? Why send me for a second opinion when she doesn’t even want to see the reports?
176213237,I have had people private message me to confirm beliefs I’ve posted about. But overall I think it’s safe

176213240,"Back in June, 3 months off of APs I went to like a animal, like 2 or 3 times a day. We had to stop that because he physically couldn’t handle it. I’m 34, in the 9 years on zyprexa we had sex maybe a total of 40 times, most of the time I just forced myself thru it cause I got nothing out of it. I did it for him, because we were in our early 20’s and 30’s. Now I’m back to not wanting sex, even without meds. We do other things to let him release, he buys sex toys thinking it’ll help, but I just don’t have it in me. He thinks it’s him, but it’s not, I live him, find him sexy even after 20 years together, but I’m just depressed from physical pain. So even if I do want to, the fact that I’m gonna be in physical pain for a week after, I just feel guilty. He’s 36, it’s not fair to him. I told him if he found someone on the side I wouldn’t object, but he told me he can’t do that, we’re in this together. Maybe once I get out of physical pain it’ll pick back up, but till I ca
n get into pain management in 6 months, gotta suffer."

174397044,"Welcome to the forum, _AT_MENTION_. I don’t think there’s any cures for schizophrenia right now, The way most people manage symptoms is with antipsychotics. Are you currently taking medications or considering them?"
176213246,"I mean, that’s an interesting theory, but kind of dumb, no offense. So all other types of hallucinations are genuine hallucinations, but auditory hallucinations are from your own voice?

My best student is an IT programmer though and wants to work for Google here. I feel satisfied about teaching when my students do well. Teaching is not too hard. But, sometimes, I feel as if it is more entertainment than serious teaching. My company places much importance on student feedback. They told me to smile more and be more appealing to the students as if I were a flight attendant. So, I wonder if my teaching skills are really good at times or is it my smile? All I know is that I’m getting paid so I just do what the company suggests. It does not harm me to smile and cater to the egos of my students, but at times, I just want to laugh about it all."

A condition that can cause me to believe a person or existence existence is or doing something to me, when in reality no existence or existence is doing anything to me at all. It is from a medical condition that is being called schizophrenia. I told myself as long as it doesn’t affect my functioning just to go on with my life. Then I relapse and could no longer rationalize this. I was on medication the whole time. When I relapsed my medication was raised and it helped a little bit."

176213285,My bmi is 23.7 according to a online site I found. Is that correct? I weigh approximately 60.7 kg and am approximately 160cm. I am exercising so much lately. Ten times a week but I eat a lot and yesterday I had chips from my local chicken shop. I’m usually pretty healthy but still pretty unhealthy.i allow myself to eat bad sometimes. I put on over five kg in just a few months.since I became vegan strangely enough. If this is correct I have a normal bmi. But I used to be pretty slim so I’m bigger than I used to be. Without medication I was 50kg. But I’m healthier now than I was then.
176213286,I’ll agree with you on that
176213287,That was my problem years ago. I was able to switch it off and on depending on how I can handle my nerves. Now it’s constant and I don’t have to be nervous. Most of the time I feel numb. So maybe extreme nerves and extreme lack of feeling anything causes it?
176213288,I just got through yelling at my neighbors. IDGAF. I’d rather live in the woods away from crackheads

I am going to eat 1 tsp a day, see if I recover. No more Daily Essential Nutrients either, just a Centrum. I want to reduce costs. I might get worse due to this though. There was a guy on Reddit who treated his IBS with a heaping teaspoon of various herbs including cloves a day. I feel just cloves alone would have accomplished that since it has such a high ORAC score. Also don’t take the troll bait. My first Amyloban 3399 thread was wrecked from that.

I have an idea for a novel, one of the short stories is a piece of it, but I’ve never gotten the whole thing down. All my writing was done before I got sick (my schizophrenic symptoms started at age 30). Honestly I can imagine paranoia might make it harder to write. Me personally, I love writing what I’ve written. I read it and reread it and enjoy it a lot. I think the key is to just write what you enjoy reading and share it with just a few people. It doesn’t even need to be published if you don’t want it to be. It’s just a great creative outlet. My voices criticize me sometimes too, I just have to ignore what they say and remember that they are negative about everything. If I wrote _PERSON_ quality work, they’d criticize that, too. Hell, if I cured cancer they’d criticize me for it. They just criticize everything."
176213301,"They didnt tell me i was literal, but they did tell me i was vulnerable to exploitation.

174397067,"WOW. All I can say is you wrote almost everything I experience. I have yet to find anyone else with so many similar experiences as me as you do. The beings/voices have also took full control of my dreams and made me feel horrible for any small mistake I have done in my life by displaying it in my dreams as well. They torture me this way and give me multiple dreams every night. There are rarely any ever positive dreams. I wake up each night from this going straight to the voices messing with my body and saying things non stop. The only time I do not experience dreams is when the give me insomnia. I never get a break from it. I feel completely lost in the world because I suppress what is truly happening because I know how it sounds. I too experience the body being controlled against my will, it will move certain parts of my body at random times, and try to trip me sometimes while I walk. It is not me doing this and not “in my head”, I physically feel this and it ranges from a variety of body mani
pulations that I would not do to myself. Whatever is controlling the body can also take control of what I say and randomly form words and say something like, “DIE”, or “DEATH TO AMERICA” (while I was throwing up), or “GO TO HELL, WHORE.” I never would say these types of things to myself, and yet this has occurred. During the body being manipulated against my will, I hear the voices say things simultaneously that leads me to believe they are behind it (among other reasons why I believe this). They have taken full control of my body (which I will not get into) and it was beyond frightening and embarrassing. I believe they will do this again when they tell me that I will commit suicide/die. I know I do not wish to do suicide, but they have the ability to take control of the body and make the body do something the actual consciousness does not. I don’t know how best to explain this, but this is my best try at it. It sounds ridiculous, but this is just a glimpse of what I continue to truly deal with

Anyway I loved sports and school. Went to college and then my third year as is customary with sz it hit. I was 21 and thrown into a BHU for 30 days. Probably a smart move but at the time I didn’t like it! Got on Haldol and spent about 20 years on that drug! In the meantime I finished up an AA degree in Liberal Arts and became a peer support specialist. But first I worked at a TJ Maxx for 5 years. But to jump back a bit I stopped taking my meds for a while and had to go back into the BHU to change meds and I started taking Abilify which was a God send. That drug has worked well for me. I must say here that we all have different brains and that different meds work differently for differe
nt people. I was in the hospital for the second time for about 10 days and my recovery has gone well since then. Moral of my story is for my process of recovery I had to find an appropriate med and then work on my recovery. I’m now in a happy relationship with my girlfriend going on 6 years and I’m working full time as a peer support specialist helping people with their recovery! Life can be wonderful if we want to take control of our destiny and work on it. We can have a full life with SZ!

174397103,"It was very, very dull. And disappointing. Just a long day in general. I was so excited to finally meet a bunch of other people with schizoaffective like me who I could talk to and empathize with and all that. The only other person I’ve ever met with sza has been my close friend here after all, and I’ve had lovely talks with you all here online so I guess I had this fantasy of it being like schizophrenia.com in a ward. Nope. Literally 99% of the people there either had absolutely no interest in interacting or just had no ability to interact. They were too far gone in their own heads. I felt like my dreams of helping other people with sz develop insight just took a big beating after what I witnessed today. We talked with one lady the whole time who was a very sweet grandma with sza who would waver in between telling us seemingly perfectly normal and believable stories about her life with random horrific ones that you would hope weren’t true to just plain absolute delusions. Don’t get me wron
g she was lovely but oh man, she talked our ears off for HOURS. Hours!! (There are no groups,activities, etc on weekends) And she had no insight whatsoever into her condition so there wasn’t really any talking with her about it, just smiling and nodding. Smiling and nodding at delusions got pretty old after the first hour and we were there for like 9 hours. Occasionally I got a word in with someone else on the unit but like I said 99% were just too far gone in their own heads to even acknowledge your presence much less talk to you. And the staff situation I was not happy with. There are literal murderers on the ward. The nurse is supposed to tell us who is unstable that day, who is stable, who is dangerous to interact with, etc. She did not do this. She left us waiting for like the first 30 mins of our shift while she took a break (their shift had literally just started an hour ago?) And then when she got to us she just said ok go talk to people and that was the end of her interaction with us. I guess thoug
h that they were severely understaffed that weekend so that may have been why. Anyways my day today was lame, dry and very long. I’m completely exhausted because I didn’t sleep at all last night because of how excited I was for today and it just totally disappointed me. Oh well."
176213481,"I’m starting to give up getting my point across in this thread. To find out if you have a diagnosis of autism you have to discount all the symptoms of autism that could have been caused by sz. It is pretty normal to shut down when you have stress, when it is not normal is when it is becuase of taste or smell or noises. Also I would imagine anything that alters your way of thinking has a chance of giving you psychosis."

I whole heartedly admit my drug use was associated to my psychosis. It wasn’t the cause of it, the psychosis came first, but the drug use didn’t help. Maybe if I had gotten clean earlier, or started meds sooner, I would be higher functioning. I consider myself mid functioning now adays."

I’m surprised you only tried 2 meds over a 7 year period though. Why did you stop the zyprexa if you don’t mind me asking?"

I do what I can, give money, supplies, anything, but one thing I will not to is become an infector. Anyway, I can’t draw. I’m good at talking, giving physical comfort, and I can’t do that now.

One time I told my pdoc that I had given this girl who was jonesing for heroin a couple of my Klonopin, and he jerked me off the Klonopin. It puts your pdoc in a very bad position when you abuse alcohol and drugs in combination with your med’s. If you got really sick and had to go to the hospital your pdoc could get into a lot of trouble. You might have to tough this one out. Make yourself some cocoa and watch a movie. Call a relative.

I’m just going back and forth in mood swings and my life is just blurred with horrible pain and suffering that is radiating my entire fricken body.

176213511,What kind of images?
174397110,"This is the top of Google results when it comes to searching about this matter… so I thought I would add my input to it. Basically, it probably mostly depends on how long that you’ve been being treated with abilify. Steady state is after like 5 or 10 injections I forget. I only had 3 or 4, so that’s where I calculated mine from. Also another factor is BMI because body weight directly correlates to how fast the poison is circulated into your system (faster if you are heavier). I’ve had 4 injections but the last one was 300mg only so that’s where my issue comes into play. But I estimated that the medication will be out of my system in 11 weeks (or rather INTO because we should really be discussing absorption half-lives NOT elimination half-lives; two different things). Any effects after that time should be the elimination half-life of ORAL Abilify considering all the medication is already into your system via fat tissues. Usually I find anti-psychotic withdrawals are about 2 weeks and direc
tly correspond with their half-lives. So Abilifies half-life being 2 weeks… I’d say the LONGEST a person will have to wait is 3 to 3.5 months to feel normal again. Cheers. Here is where I got the graph info, tga.gov.au auspar-aripiprazole-monohyrate-141125-cer.pdf 1680.19 KB And in case that site gets deleted, I put an image up on a photo sharing site (which doesn’t delete their images), here it is… Lensdump AWESOME Image AWESOME in _NAME_ images album We should remember that we’re talking different numbers here… because the state at which the medication leaves your fat tissue is about equal per hour. The elimination half-life of Depot Abilify is rather irrelevant."

It was so bad that I went so far as to check myself into a retirement home for three years. At the retirement home, I decided to do something about my cognitive impairment. I decided to start exercising for a half hour everyday (yoga). I decided to start meditating every day for 20 min. to a half hour a day. I decided to start practicing piano six days a week for an hour a day. I decided to start volunteering again. I decided to start reading classic novels. I decided to start eating nutritiously.

I was mostly into sports and working out before I started drinking in college. after I gave up my ambitions alcohol was always my go to. to replace the lack of purpose I had developed. then eventually, I got tired of drinking and started to sober up. im trying to stay sober now. but I do think about alcohol at times. im more likely to substitute other substances to relax me when I need to calm down now. like cbd hemp flower or a couple cigarettes every once in a while. I should probably kick those habits too. but it just gets me further away from alcohol where I don’t think about it anymore. today is a good day and im happy to be sober, which is my biggest struggle, is getting used to this new normal and a return back to my more youthful years. sometimes there is just nothing to do here and it makes me want to drink but not today. I also don’t think I need AA but am thinking about going. to get me out of the house, meet a few 
people, and keep me sincere about staying sober. but sometimes I think it’s better to just forget the whole thing and get on with my new normal."

And once or so since 2012 I had three days of feeling electric and hyper. So do the bipolar mood swings of sza have to be long or can they be very short too? Or is it sz if it’s short?

We also misread lots of the stuff. And our delusions seem to trick us to think they are true and real. There’s so much things we usually realize correctly, which appear in our minds parallely alongside with the delusions. I’m sure you know which channel is true and which channel tries to trick you.

174397134,"In a Swedish national sample, the etiology of substance-induced psychotic disorder and its progression to schizophrenia were investigated. Researchers performed a follow-up of individuals with the registration of substance-induced psychotic disorder between 1997 and 2015 in national medical registries (N = 7,606) for a mean duration of 84 months. They observed large elevations in standardized familial risk scores for drug abuse and alcohol use disorder and modest elevations for nonaffective psychosis among individuals with substance-induced psychotic disorder. As per findings, substantial drug exposure seems leading to substance-induced psychotic disorder in individuals at high familial risk for substance abuse and moderately elevated familial risk for psychosis. Progression from substance-induced psychosis to schizophrenia was observed in correlation with familial risk for psychosis, but not substance abuse. Schizophrenia after substance-induced psychosis seems to be a drug-precipitated disorder i

176213689,"The problem with diets is we have yet to have tools that will determine what a right diet is for an individual while the medical orthodoxy and media keeps pushing dubious cookie cutter claims. Keto can work if it’s right for you, so can paleo, and so on. The problem is the only way to find out is to try. The too much protein thing and kidneys had been debunked by science. It simply turns into glucose if you eat too much. That is not easy to do because protein is highly satiating. What we have more prevalence of is protein deficiency. If we didn’t, then we wouldn’t have old people wear diapers. Muscle wasting results from protein deficiency as protein is the building block of muscle and organs."

176213714,"Just keep strong. I used to equate life with schizophrenia is like digging oneself out of an encasement in stone with nothing but a dull knife. Just keep the pressure on making it better and it does get easier. Honestly, I can’t remember anything as well as I used to, but that is also considered a factor of aging. Like most adults don’t retain information unless they are trained readers. All the same things have gotten exponentially better in regards to intellectual functionality. My aspirations are beginning to feel the same to entertain. I know that there is more gum in the gears… but younger me used to think a good idea was motivating enough to deliver. Truth was I never got anything done. To get real things done in this world it takes grit. And living with schizophrenia will give you grit. Get gritty about it or die… that’s the sad lot of such an extreme mental illness. that all said… _AT_MENTION_ I do know what you mean when success feels empty and dissociative. Give it time… Don
’t disregard the gains that you are making.

And let the clouds pass over the schools, the classrooms, Beside the souls who cluelessly sit on the same chairs every day. Filled with tears- hospitalizations- I, restrained, screaming in the hospital: Trying to make sense of what is happening around me, With thousands of voices screaming to dissect my skin. With blood flowing from my skin, and the nurses rushing to take care of me, And I, confused, worn out, lay myself in the bed, screaming. Bottles are open; the pills now digested; I find myself in the same bed over and over again, In agony. Trying to be free from the voices. Trying to not be seen. And so the rain will fall over the hospital, and snow will fall; Then the voices will quiet down, with the physical agony in me, now awakening: You overestimated the value of life. Did you not? You thought life was to be eliminated. But now, here you are, fighting fo
r your life. Fighting to stay awake in your seizures. Fighting to save your health, your weight, your friends- everything. And now you say your life is foul? The muscles in me shrinking, life disappearing. Life, now so precious, lessening. And I told myself: this is just the beginning. Hold on. Yes, you may not live long, but hold on. You may live long, but hold on. When you will go, you will go. Just not now. Think of the children. Think of their poor souls. Think of the adults without a cure.

During that long hospitalization I was diagnosed with psychotic depression and then it was changed to schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. When I was 17 I had a manic episode and my diagnosis was changed to schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. That is still my current diagnosis at age 21.

174397166,Since it doesn’t show up on any diagnostic tests like xray or MRI whose to say its cause is even biological.

Might be an environmental cause and that’s why I think its perceiving something other worldly because otherwise wed pick up environmental cause easily

Vraylar isn’t available yet but as soon as it shows up I will let my psychiatrist know. The 2nd one is to find warnings issued by the government Health Canada about antipsychotics. Abilify (Canada & US) and Rexulti (US only) have warnings: “Health Canada’s safety review showed evidence of a link between the use of Abilify and Abilify Maintena and an increased risk of certain impulse control behaviours: pathological gambling and uncontrollable sexual behaviours (hypersexuality). Therefore, Health Canada has updated the Canadian prescribing information for both products.” hpr-rps.hres.ca Search Page - Drug and Health Product Register hpr-rps.hres.ca Search Page - Drug and Health Product Register “Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urg
es while taking REXULTI. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REXULTI.” https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/safetylabelingchanges/index.cfm?event=searchdetail.page&DrugNameID=443"

However, evidence is inconclusive about the added effect of multi-day exposure to high-level PM concentration on schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the durational effect of PM air pollution wave on schizophrenia.Data on daily HA for schizophrenia, PM (PM2.5 and PM10) and meteorological variables over the period of 2014-2017 was collected in Jining, Shandong, China. Air pollution wave of PM was defined as ?2 or ?3 or ?4 consecutive days with PM concentration ?90th or ?92.5th or ?95th or ?97.5th percentiles, respectively. A time-series Poisson regression model with duration as the variable of interest was used to evaluate the associ
ations of PM air pollution wave with HA for schizophrenia.A total of 14650 hospital admissions for schizophrenia were identified. Under various air pollution wave definitions, both PM2.5 and PM10 had significant adverse effects on schizophrenia HA. PM2.5 wave defined as ?2 consecutive days with concentration ?90th, ?92.5th, ?95th and ?97.5th percentile was associated with 4.8% (2.0%-7.6%), 4.9% (1.9%-7.9%), 5.5% (2.0%-9.2%), and 7.6% (2.9%-12.6%) increase of HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. PM2.5 waves defined as ?3 consecutive days with concentration ?90th, ?92.5th, ?95th and ?97.5th percentile respectively corresponded to 5.0% (2.3%-7.8%), 5.1% (1.9%-8.4%), 6.9% (3.0%-10.8%) and 12.0% (5.3%-19.1%) increases in HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. The most significant associations were observed on the sixth day in different lag models.PM air pollution wave was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for schizophrenia, with stronger associations among married and female patients."

I am on Abilify 15mg, which is a “compromise dose” (was finding 30mg far too high, but ended up losing pretty much everything when I stopped taking my tablets). Anyway. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 10 years ago. I was discharged from secondary mental health services. I think the NHS is unaware of the severity of my delusions and psychosis though. Really felt rushed out of the door, just when everything fell apart So, I was wondering if others find therapy beneficial?

176213809,"In my particular case 5 years ago I was feeling like my life was over. I felt like a bad person and I was really depressed. We had a computer in the living room of the group home and I would come here. I had been coming on here about ten years by that time. People knew me and my story. So people were probably surprised (to say the least) that I ended up in a hospital. People tried to cheer me up and they told me I wasn’t a bad person. A lot of people would tell me I’m a strong person and I’ll get through it. Everybody had confidence in me that the last hospitalization was just a temporary setback. So many people were nice to me. That was a very low point in my life. I don’t know what people saw when they looked at me and people on here were used to me doing good but I felt like the lowest person on the planet. But people believed in me. A lot of people who tried to help me I had known for years. When so many of them told me I would recover I started to believe them. So if you want to help s
omeone, that’s the way. Support. Listening to their problems. Being sympathetic to their situation. Using your own life experience and showing what worked for you (or what didn’t work). Encouraging someone who is trying to change their life. Seeing someone with low confidence who wants to go back to work or school and try to encourage them and support them, give them confidence."

On the other hand, I think it would give a medical professional awesome perspective into the lives and grievances of the population they are expected to treat and help make them better doctors. So I think I would be ok if they just scrolled through the forum but did not make an account or otherwise post anything. Also I think if they know one of their actual patients is on the forum it would be an invasion of privacy to come on here and could hurt the patients trust of them so they shouldn’t do that in that case."

I also could use some tips to help with the anger. Sometimes the things I think about doing to voices are violent things nobody should be thinking about. It’s hard though because the hallucinations really push me to the brink sometimes. I’m iffy on my new psychiatrist, she’s not really listening to me.

You also asked a maths question right? Which they answered wrong? So yours are def not real? Are your voices at 5% during the day constantly or do they stop completely?

It is my strong belief that I’m not just mourning the loss of my mother, but we all could be facing the loss of human civilization itself in a matter of 2 or 3 decades. With that I’ve been trying to watch how much news I pay attention to. I guess it wouldn’t concern me so much if there wasn’t a significant amount of it in my immediate surroundings. I hate being such a downer, especially right now, so I try not to take myself too seriously. Although, that’s not always the best approach, I know. Sometimes you have to feel your feelings."

174397200,"I was diagnosed after having kids. The doctors think the stress of the pregnancy triggered symptoms. My kids have a great life. My husband and I adore them, and we do our best to give them love, stability, and security. We take them to school, church, visits to family, and play dates. We spend lots of time outside. We play with them. We hug and kiss them. But, my children do not have a “normal” life. We spent our savings on psychiatric treatment, and my husband missed a lot of work during times when I was ill. We live in a two bedroom apartment on the third floor. I can’t give them a house or a yard. We don’t have money to go to camp, play sports, or go on vacation. But we take lots of day trips! Their grandparents help us often, three to four days each week. Once a week they sleep at Grandma’s. My children do not know I hallucinate. They know I go to the hospital sometimes because I am sick, but they do not know what I am sick with. A hard part of parenting for me is when you’re having 
a rough time, there’s no break. My husband works long hours, sometimes 6 long days each week. Yes, grandparents help, but most often it’s you and your child/children. You need to love them, feed them, clean up after them, keep them safe, play with them, dress them, entertain them, and teach them. You need to drive them. My doctor said wonderful things about my parenting. She said my kids are learning things I would not have been able to teach them if I weren’t diagnosed. And I work so hard to be my best. But my hardest isn’t always good enough. Sometimes they need more than I can give them. And by grace, my husband is an INCREDIBLE father! You really have to know yourself, and you have to be realistic. You can’t have kids just because you want them. In parenting, you are called to be SELFLESS. You have to be sure you can provide what they need. Schizophrenia doesn’t rule out the option of you becoming a parent. You need to be sure you can take care of yourself AND them."
174397202,"No worries, thought broadcasting is an illusion. Your thoughts are private. I’m also suffering with accepting my schizophrenia. It has taken away my peace as well. I’m trying to figure out how I can live with this so that I can live a long and healthy life too."

I personally think it is possible, but more often than not it’s used as an excuse to have a revolving door approach to mental health services. I was recovered on Olanzapine, discharged and then when I got side effects I had to re-register. I got discharged on Latuda, then 18 months later I got side effects and had to re-register. It’s a mess. The GP will not even touch my medication, and these mental health services are so slow to react. I have now been a long term service user for a few years now, and been on many meds to try and beat the side effects. Nearly won, but it will come back around again. My point although convoluted is basically that the meds are making us have a false recovery, and this recovery state is not permanent. Issues with meds are always around the corner."

G Deste, A Vita, DL Penn, AE Pinkham, G Nibbio and PD _NAME_, Schizophrenia research , Nov 25 2019 Schizophrenia spectrum disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) share many similarities. Among those features, social cognitive impairment is recognized as a key characteristic of both ASD and schizophrenia. In this study, the role of ASD symptoms, measured with the PANSS Autism Severity Score (PAUSS), was investigated as a predictor of social cognitive performance in patients with Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Existent databases from 2 studies (SCOPE Phase 3 and SCOPE Phase 5), in which a total of 361 patients (mean age 41.7 years; 117 females) were assessed with tests of mental state attribution and emotion recognition, were analyzed. Less severe ASD symptoms, as well as younger age, better premorbid IQ, and neurocognition were identified as individual predictors of better social cognitiv

176213927,I’ve been taking 10 milligrams a day of Olanzapine for 23 years. I’ve been on it since it hit the market. 5 milligrams is a very low dose. You’ll get use to it over time. I’ve heard of people taking 40 milligrams a day. I use to work 12 hour shifts a day 6 days a week taking Olanzapine. I’d come home and go straight to bed. I always take it at night 2 hours before I want to go to sleep. Olanzapine reaches max effect 6 hours after you take it. I tried taking it in the mornings but it makes me too tired. It just makes me tired and miserable. It’s best to take it at night. I skip a dose here or there but I don’t like to. I have a hard time falling a sleep without it. If I skip a dose the next day it hits me twice as hard. If you take it regularly you will get use to it. I drink coffee in the morning to fight the effects. I wake up in a fog from the medication.

I started isolating, not bc I wanted to, and then I started hearing voices in school, talking out loud to them, sleeping on the desk… got delusional as the voices got worse. Then kids from a grade lower were the party type and that’s all who accepted me so I stuck with them. On my senior graduation it was depressing. Not one person said anything to me/took a pic. When I waited in line to go on stage, the kid alphabetically next to me said “you must smoke a lot of pot” and little did he know I had psych issues and my meds were really strong"

176213948,Your variant does not have a likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant rating. So I think this might be just a “drug response” to stress and external stimuli.

176213949,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, states that most people with atypical sexual interests do not have a mental disorder. The manual says to be diagnosed with a paraphilic disorder people with these interests must demonstrate the following: feel personal distress about their interest, not merely distress resulting from society’s disapproval have a sexual desire or behavior that involves another person’s psychological distress, injury, or death, or a desire for sexual behaviors involving unwilling persons or persons unable to give legal consent. _PERSON_ notes that the topic still leaves many open-ended questions and more research is needed. He believes _NAME_ said it best in 1862 when he stated, “We do not even in the least know the final cause of sexuality. The whole subject is hidden in darkness.” from healthline. I don’t think I have particularly atypical sexual interests or an extreme fetish or anything, b
ut I do feel personal distress about my interests which may or may not be to do with society. I think the distinction they make between personal distress and distress resulting from society’s disapproval is not clear as there is a feedback loop between the two that can lead to a mental disorder or if one already has a mental disorder. I’m not sure if I would call my sexual dysfunction paraphilic either. But it is and has been a big part of my mental health problems. Anyone else willing to discuss this?"

Definitely don’t need to be from a dysfunctional family to have your genes a certain way. And abuse and trauma and stress and substance abuse can happen to anybody. Some other key factors. I’d say that growing up my non immediate family was fairly dysfunctional. My dad lost his brother I was named after him. While on my moms side my cousins were from a very dysfunctional family. They were some of my closest friends and they got into drugs and that’s part of the reasons I did at a young age too. Environment and genetics. Nurture nature is complicated to say the least.

174397257,"Basically what I am saying is that its normal to have weird beliefs. I still believe everything I experienced during my psychosis was real for example that schizophrenia will be the last illness healed that will be allowed to heaven but that ultimately everyone will go there, but there are layers of people involved with how long we wait. Also that I chose schizophrenia as a life long commitment as a way to live on this planet without a soul as that had been claimed by the devil. My strange belief doesnt prevent me from living my life though and I dont even bother telling my psychiatrist about it because it doesnt bother me in terms of functioning."

If you’ve only just started taking it, give it a couple of weeks, but if it doesn’t pass by that time, then go see your doctor. They may switch you to a different medication, or they could add something in like Mirtazapine, which is another antidepressant, but one that causes drowsiness."

Being grateful for the things I have other than schizophrenia really helps me out. I completely relate to you, except that I have visual and physical hallucinations. I’m glad that you have creative pursuits that help you. You said you like listening to music, that’s great, me too! Have you tried making music? I ask because I find engaging the sense that is hallucinating in a distraction helps me relax a lot- it never takes it away, but it is a good distraction…like for visuals I watch a TV show or paint. Visual things. The paintings are never my best because it’s hard to focus on what I’m doing but they distract me so I can relax my mind. _PERSON_ if this is a great suggestion or not, but it’s something that works for me. Good luck to you my friend."

174397253,“Human Kinetic Modeling of the 5HT6 PET Radioligand 11C-GSK215083 and Its Utility for Determining Occupancy at Both 5HT6 and 5HT2A Receptors” I got that from another article. I think 11C-GSK215083 is a measurement of how well the medications bind to the 5HT6 and 5HT2A Receptors. Both of those are serotonin receptor. The study says that each medication binds to those receptors more or less frequently in different parts of the brain. So I think the implication is that they may actually have a target when administering antipsychotics. So the whole experience for psychiatric patients may be becoming less lab ratish lol There where 18 people in the study though. And there’s quite a bit I’m not clear on. Like I have no idea how they determine where an individual is deficient.

176214094,I guess I just prefer “substance abuse” because there’s a lot of _USER_ID_ and misunderstanding about the word “drug”. Everyone does drugs Not everyone is a substance abuser. Substance abuse is bad to me Drugs are not Yet I hear a lot of _USER_ID_ towards “drugs”. It’s not a good thing when our society uses a word they don’t even know what it means so damn freely in a negative nature much of the time. When really drugs aren’t bad. It’s the abuse of drugs. And not every drug even has POTENTIAL for abuse.

I escaped the sim and everything even helped program it, repair it, change it, and reboot it several times. Im sure there are several people like me – probably schizophrenic too. I feel like God was hurt because I believed and told people and talked about simulation theory and it was His creation. I dont know. I could hsve been schizophrenic or severly delusional at the time.

176214117,"In Canada, if you are on disability they track where you live and with who. If you have a partner they can garnish his wages for back pay to any government programs.

We also have a little one, I can qualify for daycare alone and be subsidized much more than if we claimed we were together. Sure having financial security would be nice, but at what cost? We would just end up loosing more from his income even if it’s only minimum wage. I can work part-time."
176214118,My psychiatrist told me Friday on the phone that it is impossible for nortriptyline to cause diarrhea and insomnia so these problems are certainly caused by anxiety instead.

176214123,I had severe paranoia about home intruders. The best solution is a med adjustment. Call your pdoc and schedule an appointment. In the meantime look up breathing exercises and other ways to manage anxiety. Anxiety and paranoia feed off of each other and if you can keep your anxiety down it may help with the paranoia.
174397272,"Instead of thinking what’s possible or impossible, think ‘why should I care’? Because we can’t do much about it anyways. I might have some implants and had some visits from outer space, but I learned not to care that much. They aren’t hurting me or harming me anymore. It still affects me from my past lives because I have the memories, but so far I’m okay in this life. Instead of complaining, I try to figure out the philosophy of it. I like physics and math so time travel is cool and so is engineering. If I could get some fame or money out of it, cool. Most likely not. I don’t suffer right now, but sometimes I do. I think I may be a few on the planet where my delusions might actually be true in some sense. But your case definitely sounds like schizophrenia. I care. I recommend talking with a doctor and maybe looking at some different medications. It could be diet related or stress too. Energy drinks cause a flare up in my symptoms. Not sure why."

Inmate didn’t have our address, but was told that _PERSON_ was hubby’s like identical twin, and at 6 foot, he’s noticeable. Inmate had an idea of our area, he cornered my kid so _PERSON_ told him he had a gun and he’s not afraid to use it. Well, he wears a pullover hoodie all day every day, so he acted like he was going for a weapon in his front pocket, inmate took off. Cops were notified, reports for city and state filed. Probation and parole had to be notified cause it was an inmate. We never got confirmation on if it was specific inmate, cause _PERSON_ just gave description and DO

174397284,There’s a lot if different antipsychotic meds. I went through quite a lot before I found one that helped. One of them made me feel worse even. You need to speak to your doctor and explain that you need a med change (or even a dose increase) As a last resort you can ask them about Clozapine. This is a highly effective antipsychotic. May I ask what meds you’re currently on ?

176214177,I take my meds because I used to be on an injection and then I tried taking A lot of shrooms and added alcohol and caffeine and had a bad reaction. I’m not against shrooms for adult normies but this really ?????? me up bad so I’m gonna always need meds now. they were the only things allowing me to hang on by a thread for a while until I found better med combos I’m not as fd up as I used to be but I still need my meds.

176214180,"I can change your name for you. Just let me know what you want the new one to be. I’m a moderator here. As for people doing things on their own, well, you’ll always find a batch of people here who swear they can manage without medication. The individual people are always changing, because they inevitably relapse and end up realizing that there are very few who can manage to live a functional life without meds, and none of them are actually happy. There are injectable medications that can last as long as three months. Which means you would only need an appointment once every three months to stay with it. There are med bottles with timer caps and alarms, that alert you when you have missed a dose. Heck, there’s even a brand new med that has a sensor in it that activates when it hits your stomach acid, and alerts your phone if you forget to take it. There are so many options available to help you remember/stay current with your treatment. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Unless you commit a vi
olent crime, nobody will force you to take meds. Doctors can recommend treatments, but they can’t force anything on you. But think of your husband, who loves you and would like to see you happy. Think of the example you are setting for your daughter, who may one day develop psychosis and follow whatever you choose. Think of the instability you grew up with, and how life might have been different for you if your mom wasn’t battling with her own brain every day. Something else to consider: psychosis causes literal brain damage. The brains of schizophrenics show a 1-10% loss in gray matter compared to healthy subjects. My own MRI showed this same damage. Since taking meds, I haven’t lost any more gray matter."
176214181,Went out to do some errands and suddenly I started shaking and got super dizzy. I had to drive home so I sat in my car for about 20 minutes trying to feel better.

Any ideas on stopping the shakes?
176214182,CBT and dbt have both helped me. Both have given me tools to use in episodes. I had to find the right therapist who I felt comfortable opening up to complete. But it helps. I think therapy is a great idea for a lot of people. Wishing you well

176214205,It could have been laced or too much and I had a psychotic break. I don’t know. I have a lot of theories. I’m over it really. No grudges. But I think I lived in a bad environment and that there was a story behind it. I often think I’m in a causal loop (I’m no expert) and never figured it out – like how it works and stuff. I remember soul transfer and time travel and stuff and alien abductions and experiments and ‘hard/tough lessons’. I was driven insane pretty much… The dissociation and sensory abnormalities were way worse than the thought disorder in my opinion. I kept obsessing about the matrix and unreality and stuff and it drove me mad.
176214206,Sounds like you obsess over things _AT_MENTION_ . This is similar to overthinking. I do this a lot myself. Try to distract yourself with other activities when this happens. This kind of helps me.

I am sometimes on autopilot, doing things with little awareness of what I am doing at the time I am doing it but then my memory kinda connects me to what I am doing and I can 'come to ’ and be in the moment. The thing is I feel different about every day, my awareness of individual moments is very variable, sometimes I am stuck more in my head and I tune out the world but other times I have a hard time having my thoughts connected to current reality. I can’t explain this very well but if anyone knows at all what I am trying to say - feel free to shed some light on what this is."

176214231,"This question ties in very neatly with the traditional debate on the rol of art in society, at least in capitalist societies. It would be tempting to shield oneself behind the Frankfurt School and suggest in unforgivably elitist fashion that great art liberates, and junk art enslaves. This account is not without problems, not just the elitism, the belief in authorative canons of great work, but also the Marxist baggage - alienation, class consciousness, false consciousness etc. In addition sociology of culture teaches us about the often sophisticated cultural negotiation of popular culture artifacts that takes place at individual level, which problematises further the distinction between great and junk art. This “negotiation” is more than postmodern posturing and its roots can be traced back to at least the XIXth century as shown in the work of the likes of _PERSON_. I;m not feeling delusional today so this is the best I could do at such short notice."
174397308,I got sick in July of 2008 so it’s been almost 12 years. It hit me late in life but hit hard. I had just turned 38. I got the sz diagnosis in Jan of 2010 so I was 39 and a half so it took about 18 months to get the diagnosis. It was always paranoid schizophrenia though. Unfortunately it was 2014 before I actually figured out I had it and was sick. That was a long six years. Very painful. I am in a better place now though.
176214232,"For me it was below average in Canada. I understand that Canada don’t have the budget for good free mental hospitals. I was 21, now I am 29. I was put with prisoners, drug addicts, mentally disabled and mentally ill patients. One guy was walking nude in the hospital and security jumped on him and isolated him. He came to my room nude once after midnight and my roommate kicked him out. A lady was talking to herself that her husband killed her kids. A 19 y.o. girl tried to sleep with me at night, she came to my room, sat on my bed trying to sleep next to me. She wanted to have sex. I said no then she wanted to smoke weed with me in the bathroom. I refused. I felt that she wanted to drug me to have sex with me. She looks like a psychopath. Another young girl was having sex with a guy in the room next to me. There was a guy who was a drug addict, he was allowed to smoke marijuana on the balcony of the hospital. Another was in prison for more than 20 years. Once a young guy and a young girl had sex in 
my room after the security agents went out after midnight. It was disgusting. I was sleeping next to their bed, I turned my head so I don’t see them. Some patients were aggressive and agitated hitting walls. They were isolated and attached to a bed in a hidden closed room. They injected them with benzodiazepines sedatives to calm them. There were weird ppl, a guy made a black coffin with woodsticks and told me its his grave. He looked depressed and sad like hell. Patients were fighting over TV remote. There was more disgusting stuff that I can’t say here. How was your stay? (I don’t know if I am allowed to expose what I experienced in my psychiatric hospital, is it illegal?)"

174397297,"nothing cures negatives except maybe the plain old stuff like routine, exercise, good diet, water, meditation, good meds that work, and grit. They told me to start small and just make it a habit and stuff. Start with the small stuff like showering and cleaning your room. break the task into small parts and maybe listen to music or something. I had severe negatives and they have sort of returned. i tried like over 20 supplements. some gave me partial relief and some stopped working and others did more harm than good. Some did nothing. I spent too much money but I was desperate. I should take my own advice because I just sit and do nothing. I sort of gave up on life already. I also enjoy computer time and reading and learning."
176214237,"It really all depends on how much you care what others think. When you have irregular behaviors in public, you’ll get stared at. To me, I don’t much care about being stared at. It’s worth it in exchange for being able to freely be myself. But there are certain tics I have worked very hard to get rid of, because they were more intrusive into my life. For example, I was able to replace hand flapping with leg bounces, because my hand flaps were very sporadic and uncontrolled, and I worried about hitting someone."
174397300,"yea… I once got a called that started with one person talking then suddenly changed to a different person talking like it was them who called; warped part, I kept talking to the different person. wasn’t like fake 2 people pulling a prank on me… coz non of them knew each other or had any contact or relation beyond my association with them… a.k.a they were strangers to each other. As far as am concerned, it was just a case of how the schizophrenia works - I just got to see it more clear through that call because I always wondered how I never hear what people are actually saying - that call just liked hijacked the whole ‘who’s talking?’ thing"

176214291,I remember when o j _PERSON_ got out of jail. They interviewed him on the news about writing a blog in prison. I thought the government was ran by powerful people and Hollywood elites and that they were mocking me because I wrote anti-government propaganda on a blog. I couldn’t watch tv without thinking that I’m crazy. Then I thought that the government was conditioning me to focus on the colors red and blue through everyday people; all of a sudden I saw red and blue colors everywhere on tv validating that the government was run by a Hollywood and elite propaganda machine. Now I think wherever I go that people are talking about me to drive me crazy; it’s like everyone is talking about me indirectly. Sounds crazy just writing it down but in my mind it’s like some Snowden like government operation to discredit people so they look crazy so you can’t speak out about powerful people.
176214292,I have always done the right thing at the time and often that has left me behind. I know it’s attractive but I think you did the right thing even back then regarding that situation.

Second, overeating and obesity may arise from an inability to accurately detect interoceptive signals of satiety PubMed Central (PMC) Interoceptive Contributions to Healthy Eating and Obesity Obesity results from persistent failure by the brain to balance food intake with energy needs, resulting in a state of chronic energy surplus. Although there are many factors that predispose individuals to weight gain and obesity, the current review... The full feeling after eating is no better here than it was in Essex . I try harder to ignore the feelings of hunger, but it’s not easy . It’s very much a case of 4 steps forward and 3 steps back . One thing I have cut back on is the takeaways . What helps is that there’s fewer places to choose from than in Essex . I have about 2-3 takeaways a month compared to the 14 or so I had a month in Essex . I should do more exercise , but am always stumped as to what to do . Walking is an option but I can only walk short distances bec
ause of my poor sense of direction . Added to that is lower back ache . It’s at the point now that even walking a short distance to put the rubbish out can make my lower back ache .

174397326,"I see a ham sandwich in my future in five minutes. But seriously, there’s an old saying that goes, “Even a stopped watch is right two times a day.” Bad s*it really happens sometimes. Becoming schizophrenic is the best example of that. No, you cannot predict the future and you can’t guard against every bad possibility that can happen in life. You may get hit by a car tomorrow; on the other hand you can live another 30 years without getting hit by a car. You may catch some rare disease and die 5 years from now, but you can’t predict that and it may never happen. I can almost guarantee you that some more bad stuff is going to happen to you in the future, because bad stuff happens to everybody. When you look at the infinite number of bad stuff that happens in life, you face a lot of the same risks that most people face. But you can’t waste your life living in fear of some unknown catastrophe that might never happen. And I guess it needs mentioning that a lot of good stuff can happen to you 
too."

176214310,"Hi. According to the FMLA you are entitled to 90 days of unpaid leave for medical reasons within a rolling year. And reasonable accomodations does mean that they are required to provide you with, for example, the ability to take your 15 minute break as needed if you need time to get your panic attack under control. Please save WRITTEN copies of these write-ups and contact your local employment office or office of disabilities. Go to your doctor and get a note saying you require the ability to take your fifteen minute break as needed due to a medical condition. Look up your state to find out if you are an “at will” state. If you are not, you can easily sue them for discrimination if they fire you. If you are, it will be a bit harder to prove, which is why you NEED written copies of your write-ups."

174397324,"I thought I was jesus because I had a miracle birth like jesus did. For one my mom was 43 coming off 4 straight miscarriages, then she had me. I had tons of birth complications like lack of oxygen from the umbilichal chord around my neck, pulled out by forceps, my mom had a blood clot during pregnancy, she had to get shots every single day for 6 months. So there was that…my “miraculous birth” in common with jesus also we are both at least part jewish. and other ethnical coincidences I thought and then theres delusions of reference which were the final icing on the cake. And there was all the traumas in my life which forced me to lose my ego. I think “loss of ego”=key to enlightenment. Actually that’s what I thought when I was 19. But I had already lost my ego. I had no ego because I was already schizophrenic from since 14 years old…maybe since 11. But then at 19 when I had a bad LSD trip I lost my ego again. Because my friend called me up on the phone and said “YOUR EGO” and I sai
d “I KNOW” So there was all this pushing forwardness and backwardness with the yin and yang simultaneously from different directions. In the end it was just insanity, but then a ton of people fed into my delusions. I know that god is real. Oh boy do I Know. And I know that god has shown himself to me. And ive talked to god. And hes communicated with me. That said I dont think im the chosen one for at least 5 days now…and I haven’t thought I was “Jesus” in months. I dont even like jesus or believe in him or anything. I hate the idea of jesus. I get sick when I hear “_PERSON_” on the radio. Honest to god it makes me sick to my stomach. But there is a lot more reason I believed I was jesus. But there is more coincidence than anyone could possibly talk me out of the delusion. Only myself can talk myself out of the delusion by saying “someones ??????? with you, but you must ignore it” If I look at evidence of things like things that have happened to me in the past, there is more evidence I AM t
he chosen one than not, to me. So I must look at evidence from a logical standpoint of probability and other reasonings. And with that, I can temporarily defeat and live with the delusions Albeit never perfect"

I’m more concerned that this is a recurring pattern of his than whether his ego is hurt or not because some random stranger doesn’t think he’s all that great."
176214318,yea i think the same… but it was hard cause i lived with her for 17 years and i was so used to her being there =(
174397325,Interesting… I wonder if this is why I carry myself somewhat awkwardly. A topic this made me think of which you may not know is “ideomotor effect”. Or “Ideomotor phenomenon”. It makes for an awful “poker face”. Anyway it’s a quick read on Wikipedia.
176214319,Actually…this one is a bit less harsh…and perhaps more accurate…
176214320,Talk to your pdoc about it. If you really want to do this _NAME_ your arguments beforehand so that you can be persuasive to your pdoc. They will probably oppose this just out of routine. That kind of thing can be hard to argue against.

176214329,I was told my uncle is my guardian angel When I was younger I said where is he and my mom said he’s right there. He had the same name as me he died in 1986 I was born in 1990. My mom would tell me stuff like about ghosts and spirits and stuff. So would my sister but I believed a lot of mystical things as a young child.

176214350,_PERSON_ I was waiting for someone to get the reference Nice catch.
174397328,"In the beginning it was okay I think. Then HIPPA laws and ??????? loser patients got our freedoms taken away. Now, it isnt like a resort but a prison. I hate it there now. Been outpatient and inpatient over 30 times I think IN THIS LIFE. since, I’m coming back alive via a causal loop or consciousness transfer, or even time travel, I hate mental hospitals now. Figured we live in a computer simulation where I keep coming back alive and I’m aware and cognizant of it. Been there thousands and millions of times possibly in the multiverse or different simulations. It could be a time loop like in movies and video games. I start my life over ad infinitum after my schizophrenia hits in 2013, but it’s possible i came back alive earliest in 2009. I dont think it’s a cloning center… Even greys would send me to a hell like torment at the mental hospital by sending my consciousness or soul through wormholes and then I would perish a horrible death. Was it the greys or reptilians or milabs at the mental 
hospital? This happened hundred to thousand of times because of bad karma. My step father in a past life was either psychic or a reptilian. He told me weird stuff. I dont feel comfortable talking about it. I wanted to be ‘psychic’ or reptilian like him. He said it would be painful and I was tortured or experimented on hundreds or thousands of times to become psychic, reptilian, or a whatever. It was a different life/universe. I used to be insane but they lessened the psychosis… In this life and in past lives, hes a great, nice, good step father. I care about him. I found out he did some minor work for the government which I cannot and wont talk about. I think I was targeted because I was a time traveler… Anyways, that’s my thoughts and it’s possible my schizophrenia severely distorted and twisted my memories and even my reality in my other lives… I’m better now. Do I blame myself, the greys, or reptilians? Was I power hungry? Was it all a lie? I just remember my psychic step father could mind 
control me if I looked or stared into his eyes. Maybe it was an alien in a distant past life. Maybe a vampire? I remember my past lives. He’s not that guy/person anymore."

176214375,I’ve tried Stablon more than 25 years ago when I was a teen aged 15 yo during premorbid/prodromal phase. I was diagnosed depressed but not sz yet. Stablon is an AP. It doesn’t solved my panic attacks at school. I wonder if it doesn’t worsen the situation. Moreover the _PERSON_ laboratory which exploites this medication is involved in public health scandals. I wouldn’t trust them today.

I was psychotic for 2 1/2 years and I’ll give it that it was maybe interesting a couple of times but never , never close to being enjoyable or anything else positive or good about it. Meds, keep us out of hospitals. For most people who take meds it improves their quality of life even if it’s just a little. Meds help people function. The discovery that a drug could help ease the intensity of symptoms and even get rid of some is what got supposedly hopeless patients who otherwise would spend their lives in hospitals, back out into the world and society. The evidence that medication helps most people is so obvious and overwhelmingly proven that it amazes me when people deny the fact. Medication helps the majority of schizophrenics. It’s been proven in thousands of patients for the past 60 years. It doesn’t work for a minority of people but for the majority w

176214413,"Overall my psychiatric care provider gets by with one psychiatrist. That’s why they use therapists. They get the same amount of money I think regardless of who does the psychotherapy. My psychiatric care provider is a charitable not-for-profit, so they just have to break even. They also take tax-deductible donations to stay in business. They also take indigent people with no insurance who can’t pay. I was one of those. I was homeless and uninsured when I started going to my psychiatric care provider. I have disability and Medicare now."
176214414,I get that side effect from the haldol pills too but not the injection. I had the same worries though too when I first started with the injection. Takes some thought.

Can you stay there for a while?"

I don’t talk about masturbation usually unless I’m answering someone else’s thread but I was masturbating at least every other day until just maybe two years ago. Now it’s about once a month. I’m 59 and it’s a relief. I’ll still joke about sex but my “friends with benefits” plan is going to take a backseat to other things going on in my life.

Just be real careful and know nobody, even your doctor, can predict what happens if you quit. Good luck with whatever you decide to do!"

A _PERSON_ and ?A _NAME_, Schizophrenia research , Oct 22 2019 When the antipsychotic treatment should be discontinued after first-episode of schizophrenia (FES) in patients who had a good response to initial treatment is still controversial. The aim of this naturalistic follow-up study was to determine the rate of antipsychotic discontinuation in the maintenance phase and its consequences, after FES.FES patients (n?=?105) were followed-up for at least 24 months and up to 22 years (mean?=?99.1 months). After minimum one-year antipsychotic treatment without relapse, some patients' antipsychotics were discontinued by psychiatrist. We compared the clinical characteristics of this group to those who stopped their medication themselves and analyzed the predictors of being relapse-free after discontinuation.Seventeen (16.2%) of the p
atients' antipsychotic was discontinued by their psychiatrist. Using the same antipsychotic during the first year was the predictor of discontinuation by the psychiatrist in logistic regression analysis. Ten (58.8%) of them relapsed. Thirty-nine patients (37.1%) discontinued their antipsychotic themselves, relapse rate was 76.9% (n?=?30). There was no clinical difference between these two groups. Overall, the patients who had no relapse after discontinuation had better role and global functioning at baseline, were more likely to meet remission criteria, and their antipsychotic was discontinued by psychiatrist and use same antipsychotic during the first year.Our findings suggest that antipsychotic discontinuation by psychiatrist was possible for only small portion of the FES patients, and relapse rates are high after discontinuation even in these selected patients."

176214559,"I used to feel horrible when people would call those with psychosis dangerous as well. I always thought I’m not a danger to anyone even when I’m super psychotic! Which was true, I was just terrified of everything while psychotic and couldn’t harm a fly. However at my recent psych rotation for nursing school at a state mental hospital, I learned there that unfortunately my experience of psychosis is not true for everyone. The truth is psychosis CAN be dangerous. It can lead people to do very stupid things. It can be dangerous for the person with psychosis when they do things like wander around and jump in rivers or off buildings or go to sketchy areas because they dont know what they’re doing. It can be dangerous to other people when they are paranoid and lash out in self defense. I think people with psychosis do not MEAN to be dangerous, and I do not think they are violent. They are just scared and confused. I think most situations where people with psychosis become violent could be avoided 
if the public were educated on what psychosis looks like and how to respond to it, as again from all the cases I saw the only reason why the psychotic person became violent is because someone was getting all up in their face about trespassing and scaring them or a police offer was trying to restrain them and drag them away and they had no idea what was going on in either situation. So yes it is sad that those of us who do not become violent or dangerous when psychotic are lumped in with those who do, but we can’t deny that psychosis itself CAN BE dangerous and there are people who struggle with that experience who feel very bad about what they’ve done and who they have hurt. Many have harmed family members while psychotic because they thought they were trying to kill them. So I can understand that person’s sentiment, and I can understand not wanting to interact with a psychotic person unless they are compliant with meds. Dealing with psychotic people who refuse meds can be extremely challenging, I have 
witnessed this firsthand now."

And I had 3 chest freezers. I also did eggnog bread from Thanksgiving-January, but those were 14 a loaf cause rum extract is expensive and I know using real rum woulda been cheaper, but I couldn’t find one to give the taste I liked. That was nice additional income, and anything we still had in freezers when we moved, we just gave to the jail at _NAME_’s going away party they threw for him. 68 loaves of bread…which makes me laugh cause we got an Xmas card this year asking if I’d mail a package of eggnog bread to the jail.

I never found out if I had been denied until I called the local social security office. I never received a denial letter. So I have to apply again over the phone. Its stressing me out. But here are my points: I have been diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia since the age of 16. I am 31 now; I have tried to finish college and work but my illness has severely limited me. I attempted work at a warehouse but had to quit because the stress and night hours caused auditory hallucinations and emotional stress. It’s not that I don’t want to work and be successful, and sometimes I lack the insight to even realize my own shortcomings. This has made it hard for me to get SSI because I have been struggling with schizophrenia since the age of sixteen and have never had government benefits for it so I have tried working which added even more stress. I hope they will help me because it’s miserable having 
no income, and not being able to pay certain bills. Medicaid has saved my life, improved my mental health and brought me out from a lot of pain. But it’s not security, and not going to keep me alive if I have no income and can’t work. So my phone interview is set for april. Hopefully I convey that I need long term support."
176214611,Have you talked to your doctor to make sure that there aren’t other medications that you might be able to take? What is it like to be doped out by an anti-psychotic medication? I’m new to this and I haven’t started them yet. I think some additional anxiety as you try to reconnect with the world should be expected. I hope that you don’t get discouraged. I get bouts of anxiety too. I address them without medication by exercising. Lifting weights and yoga helps to relieve those feelings. That helps me sleep at night too. What isolated you for 15 years? Just your own social anxiety? Good luck my friend.

I decided right then to maybe buy something in Safeway and give it to the person. So I shopped around and decided on a big bottle of orange juice, a smoothie, and a container of macaroni from the deli and a container of ambrosia (the stuff with fruit, marshmallows, coconut in some kind of sweet sauce). So I bought the food and drove over to where the person was sleeping and walked up and said “excuse me”.

174397416,"I understand, however, the person you know on the forum is not who I am in real life. I don’t put on a façade for you guys, but I talk about my problems a lot, and believe it or not, I’m a lot more conservative on here than I am in real life, because this is first and foremost a support forum for people with severe mental illness, not the YouTube comment section, and there are certain opinions that simply don’t need to be discussed here. In real life, I rarely discuss my symptoms with anyone but my mom. Even in high school and over text, we discuss other things. And it’s not that I’m ashamed of my illness, because I’m not, and I have no issue discussing it with anyone who asks, but honestly, who wants to talk about schizophrenia 24/7, you know? There are other things in life. TV, movies, documentaries, videos, music, memes, food, trivia, pictures, games, jokes, the news, memories, work, school, gossip, why the fûck my fingernails won’t grow any longer that three centimeters without 
breaking , etc."
176214630,I know you’ve been denied but see how your treatment goes. Benefits isn’t a bad thing as if you live stress free life is grand. Trouble is that limited income can be a burden and often cause it’s own stress. Nothing like living from week to week and struggling to pay bills. Your young enough to have some time to figure it out. I’m glad your partner will help support you and your family is solid. Support makes our worlds that much easier. What about trying a different type of work? I know that is problematic in our current world where jobs are fast disappearing but might be worth some thought…
176214631,"Maybe one of the reason I think it felt great was because I was never left psychotic for too long compared to some… I don’t know I am torn between being psychotic and normal, the meds do work I feel “normal” while on them, they have given me a 2nd life in some ways, I don’t know."

I got 100 out of 100 points possible. And my teacher wrote a little note asking me if he can use my essay in all his future classes as an example of how an essay should be written. Also, before that, I took an online class about the Beatles, my favorite band. I was doing great and then at the end of the class for the last question on the final he asked us to summarize the Beatles impact on music and their place in history in a short paragraph. I submitted my answer and he graded it and gave me an A for the final and told me that in the ten years that he had been teaching this class, that my final answer was the best he had ever seen. And he gave me an A+ for the class, the only A+ I ever got in college."

176214662,Sounds a solid plan my friend. Glad your negative on the covid and you can get your shot…I love it when a plan comes together!
176214663,Your not playing on an even playing surface. Sz is serious business. It takes life away from you but it’s not something you can’t overcome. It’s not your fault. It’s the fault of some faulty genetics. All’s I’m saying is that other people didn’t have the same burdens we have. You can’t rate or compare yourself to others who never had the same burdens. It is not your fault. You can’t blame yourself for things that you had no control over and psychosis is just that. Blame some genetics. Blame a trigger. STuff the money or the impact. An alcoholic has far greater impact on the community than you did seeking help. A drug addict takes more out of the community than you do taking meds and trying to keep well. Your priorities are wrong. Don’t punish yourself for the cards your dealt with. Be strong and define yourself on the things you’ve overcome. All’s I’m saying.
176214664,I’ve had some bad experiences from smoking pot. I used to get anxiety and paranoia and become a stupid zoned out forgetful zombie. I’m doing much better now that I’m sober and on good medication.

It is still under warranty but I have to drive 500 miles home on Friday. Hoping the transmission doesn’t go out. I had the day off from work today. That’s all I managed to do."

Segue here but havjng abuse in your “portfolio” or “narrative” seems almost like the “rule” here - instead of the “exception.” Omitting thoughts is maybe all I’ve ever known, there IS such a thing as emotional abuse. I forgive my Dad, bc we have problems going back generations. He had it FAR worse. And he’s a SICK provider for me with physical needs like food and shelter. _AT_MENTION_ I’ll pose you some “attention”. Did I upset your apple cart somewhere along the way?

The truth is that there are things that I can control, and there are things that I cannot control. I have limitations, so I have to accept uncertainty; and uncertainty is neither good or bad. I have to focus on what’s going on right now; what can I do to improve this moment.

But you have to bounce back and you only live once. I’ve never met a happy person who has never been married. Lifting weights helps too. I used to lift but I recently started again 5 weeks ago.

If so I would highly suggest finding an affordable option to try again, maybe some of your credits would even tranfer, or you could take a placement test! To me it feels super fulfilling doing what I always wanted to do, so if thats really what you want I think you should go for it And for the record, in most fields feeling dumb is the norm–imposter syndrome. Im sure youre really bright, many people could not get a C in abstract algebra trust me (maybe not me either lol). So Id highly recommend giving it another shot, and seek guidance this time from a professor you trust. Tell them you have issues with dealing with the stress and seek out the office of diability for your school, they have made all the difference in affording me extra time to do assignments and make sure I pass with the knowledge that I need to do well in my field. If not, thats fine too. But I firmly believe if you want it, you can still have it. Best

I never tell any employer I have schizophrenia if I can help it but at a few jobs, my boss knew because the employer hired people with disabilities and I got the jobs through a mental health agency. But I remember I was talking to a co-worker many years ago and the conversation for some reason was about suicide. I mentioned 5 people I knew had committed suicide The woman instantly stiffened up and suspected something was not right about me. But I backed off and got myself out of the situation.

You may get a bunch of people saying one is great, then you try it and it is awful. Meds are trial and error, there are no tests you can take that will tell you how you will react or which is better.

174397449,I find Abilify helps both with positive and negative symptoms but early morning awakening seems to be a common side effect. You can take it morning or night and with or without food. My intense hunger went away on the Abilify and I can eat like a normal human being again!
176214738,"Nobody can read your thoughts. They can pick up on your body language and expressions, though. A common phenomenon for people in psychotic states is accidentally saying their thoughts out loud without realizing it. Then when people comment on what they’ve said, they think the person read their mind. But really, the person just heard them speak. Maybe this is happening to you."

176214740,There’s two issues here it seems to me… You are obsessing about this fact. It usually doesn’t matter with things like sex with a partner. I think I had the same issues but when I got a partner it didn’t matter. I was never found wanting and it’s usually not a problem anyways. Either way. Talk to a regular doctor. They can knock you out and do tests on you but gawd. I wouldn’t do that but keep some perspective. Most guys aren’t huge. Most guys get by. You need to move past this and fixate on getting well enough to have sexual relationships with people in my book.

174397444,Side effects are a genuine fear. I would suggest asking about Abilify or Aristada. They have less side effects. I have tried risperdal and Invega. Those gave me a lot of side effects. Moving to Aristada got rid of them. I feel clear headed and just like I did before getting very sick.

176214755,"Maybe you can call her a couple more times and leave a message. Tell her your understanding is that she should have called you and you’re wondering what’s going on. It might be a simple misunderstanding. If she still doesn’t call you back then call up the psychiatrist or whoever is running that clinic and tell them it’s been a month and your case worker is not calling you. You don’t have to be nasty or rude, or confrontational. Just tell them you need a case worker to help you and you’re wondering why this one is not getting back to you. Like I said it could be a misunderstanding and maybe she is under the impression that you are fine and don’t need her help. Or it could be some other reason. The bottom line is you need help and you’re not getting it. Don’t deliberately try to get her in trouble but if she is not doing her job she needs to be called on it and you need to get help any way you can including a complaint. You have a right to know what’s going on with her."

I think I was giving up on society at the time. Although, I did not associate the voices as something coming from me. I don’t know. I’ve never liked violence, or watching people get hurt. I thought about killing my partner when I was in psychosis, but it was more of a pleasure thing cause I imagined all our body parts melding together. I didn’t want to go through with it though.

She’s DOC now and been steady with _PERSON_ for 2 or 3 years, so no longer needs that clinic nor tests, but we do have it here. I should also tell you the town we grew up in and she lives and went to school was one of highest HIV/AIDS concentration in WI, sadly, also highest teen pregnancy in state even moreso than Milwaukee. But since you’re not US, but it was surgery bloodwork you had elevated counts right? They test for that before surgery, I’d say you’re good."

I’ve known I am an as$hole for a long time, but now it’s like I’m Uber as$hole. I’m hoping this smooths out over time. Unfortunately I’ve already injected the stuff so I have to live with the results. So even though you may be fat, have tits and be impotent, it might be better than the mood swings injectable testosterone can cause. Anyway, if I’ve been short with anyone lately, I apologize."

It was horrible and greatly distressing for the little bit of emotion that I had. Now I’m doing much better. I can talk again, feel emotion, express my hobbies, and feel like me once again. Now, I still have some symptoms like lack of motivation and some of the others I had but not as severe. I can say that with my antidepressants, it has greatly improved my ability to function."

I also kind of wilfully try to convince myself to not think about it or not think at all, it’s like when you are trying to deal with voices. Sometimes it is possible to shut it out. or at least blank your mind. Escaping through reading, music, maybe playing video games or other types of hobby type activities of interest to you on a personal level are maybe also good distractions.

174397516,"I’m not feeling too well. Thought about going back to the hospital and trying Clozaril but I’m not sure if I should try harder, push through it, and or find a better, more equipped hospital. I get a lot of “trauma” from schizophrenia. I’m starting to see that I’ll never get the proper help or compensation for my problems and “delusions”. Money would be nice, but I rather just try to go back to school (some day) and get that degree in computer engineering. I feel like I’m in hell, a dream, or something worse than hell and worse than a nightmare. Hell on earth. It never ends. I had a normal life once and in one day I apparently destroyed my own ??????? life in an instant. It involves conspiracy theories, aliens, and UFOs mainly and the Men in Black – the real ones and it all started in university I think. I strongly believe that you and I live in a computer simulation that repeats in a similar way and manner and never stops repeating. The thoughts tell me the Men in Black ruined m
y life and gave me schizophrenia for eternity (the thoughts say 10 years) so I’m hoping I’ll get better, improve, and possibly see a cure in my lifetime or advance to a higher plane of existence like the next dimesion. In this dimension and reality, I always have schizophrenia and memory loss. I smoked pot 9 years ago and had a really, really bad trip and I think while I was high and traumatized, I got abducted by grey aliens and went to Mars or so I think and then I got a very, traumatic visit from the Men in Black. I even saw their craft or UFO around that time. I think I’m sort of crazy and possibly insane because it’s like _PERSON_’s movie and book ‘Adujustment Bureau’ or something like that. I don’t know. It’s just my insane theory and belief because there’s no evidence and nobody really believes, remembers me, cares, or understands. It’s like I’m the only one that remembers and knows these things. I call them computer simulators because I’ve been remembering things, coming back 
alive, and going to different realities or computer programs altogether for infinity or eternity. And I’m always messed up. It’s like a very slow, tedius process of evolution and experiment of the ‘game’. Felt like I even escaped once before and was one of them and now I’m stuck here forever with ‘insanity’ or treatment resistant schizophrenia. Why do I deserve this? I don’t know. Even thought they sent me back in time or through a wormhole to a parallel universe as an experiment or to cover it up. But that’s crazy and I don’t know. I initially told the doctors that I thought I was in the Matrix and went through a wormhole back in time. Life starts for me or is different sometimes before 2010/2011. I have this delusion that I keep waking up around 2011-2013 or something like on repeat for eternity/infinity. It seems like my consciousness or soul or spirit is being ?????? with constantly like involving time travel back in time to an earlier date where my body is even more schizophrenic – 
like my life restarts with schizophrenia. It feels like the Illuminati and aliens or some ????. Can’t do ???? except pray to Jesus and hope for a better future and life. I also feel like moving on from these forums too. I feel like giving up sometimes."

174397518,"I tried a lot without luck, Seroquel made my hallucinations worse and made me gain weight, Invega made me walk in circles constantly (akathisia is what it’s called), Latuda made me suicidal, but Zyprexa which is the last drug I tried helps a lot. It keeps the delusions and paranoia away. The only negative is that it doesn’t eliminate voices or images that I hallucinate. Still I really do better on it than when I’m not on anything, lots better. It’s hard to recommend it though because different people react differently to different APs. For me 10mg of Zyprexa is the best drug and dose, I only have mild akathisia and the paranoia/delusions are completely gone. I don’t have scars on my face but I have a lot on my arms and hands from accidents and self harm early on with the disease. I’m not beautiful but I posted a few pics on the selfie thread because every now and then I take a photo I think I look good in."

HOW could any of this be possible!” But then I think about certain events that happened when I first started having psychodic episodes and the way I remember what happened is I just feel that there’s no way that it couldn’t be untrue. Maybe my hallucinations or delusions were stronger? I have no idea. Every day I keep telling myself that stuff isn’t true but then I remember things from my past and then I’m back to confused and scared and terrified. Never been on meds.

By that he actually meant ejaculation from masturbation. Not everyone understood what he was implying. He also said that a man’s left testicle hangs lower.

176215047,I had thoughts of raping my mother and killing. That’s why I tried to kill myself and ended up in the emergency for liver poisoning. Emergency psychiatrist diagnosed me with psychosis. I wonder if it can be OCD intrusive thoughts. Luckily I don’t have these thoughts on antipsychotics.

176215050,"If that’s your opinion, fine, but please be careful about expressing that sentiment. Some people on here are one stressor away from a psychotic break. That said, we take meds because they keep us from being psychotic. My mom told me that, without meds, I’m completely out of it; hallucinating, deluded, barely able to talk, hiding in closets, crying all the time, etc. How is a person meant to engage in therapy without having a firm grasp on reality? Why would anyone be willing to address their psychosis if they don’t think they’re psychotic? If you’re not currently psychotic, then don’t bother changing anything. I was under the impression that you were having some pretty bad, but not fully episodic, psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics aren’t really meant to help with fears unless said fears are the direct result of psychosis. (I’m not saying that they can’t, I’m just saying that easing non psychotic fears isn’t exactly their strong suit) For instance, I no longer fear “the lady 
in the green hat” because the only reason I feared her was that my voices told me that she was supposed to kill me and that I was supposed to let her. I know you have a lot of fears, but are the ones based in psychosis any better? If so, then the Zyprexa is probably working just fine."

I am in better health now than I have been since before being diagnosed, so looking forward to the future.

176215114,"Why would that annoy us? You’re just doing what this forum is for. Anyways, I can sure relate to barely hanging on. It still happens to me on a regular basis. I’m lucky because I’m older and my symptoms aren’t intense. So when I’m barely hanging on, the feeling rarely lasts. Can you do some activity to get your mind off your troubles? Even just cleaning or walking. Man, you should get a cat, they’re relatively low maintenance and good to have around. Petting a purring cat was always therapeutic for me. Are you going to be alright?

Some people have reported that aspartame gives them headaches or dizziness or affects their moods, but studies haven’t linked those symptoms to aspartame. If you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare metabolic disorder , avoid aspartame, because it contains phenylalanine . Any product containing aspartame has a warning label about that."

I see the females get more likes than males, and there’s one user where whenever she posts a new selfie, people talk about how hot she is in the Discord group. I guess that’s why I don’t share more selfies than I do. I know I’m not hot and I don’t even consider myself female, but I wouldn’t want that done to me."

176215175,"Hi definitely something went wrong with me back in 2014. To this day, I am so woozy in my head and falling in all directions , not actually falling but a feeling I’m going to fall. I dont like this wooziness in my head at all. Dont know the reason for last minute cancellation of my spinal surgery, the surgeon rang me back in 2015, and apologized for not going ahead with the planned surgery. It was to put screws in my neck, c5, c6, some kind of surgery like that. Anyway he rang and said that he was told by the neurologist not to proceed. That was it. No cause as to why this happened. I’m afraid theres something they’re not telling me. Really I am. I mean my whole case is suspicious. Reports of infective came out only after I had pressed for biopsy. I pressed for biopsy because I feel so woozy and heaviness in my head. No luck, neurosurgeon said he had no problem doing the biopsy but needed a neurologist to.give the results to, but my then neurologist didnt agree to do biopsy, then the MRI scan 
the neurosurgeon did had infective in it, along with, small vessel disease, migraine, demylnation, but before that, all my reports had no infective but the others yes, so that threw me. Look to be honest, I’m very sceptical of the whole lot of it. It’s not adding up or making sense. Forgive me, but I think they are hiding something from me, because it all stabilised and no progression. By all accounts now, my illness is a somataform disorder. That’s what’s causing my physical symptoms. Anytime I bring up to my psychiatrist the above, he increases the seroquel. And quickly moves away from the facts. I don’t know what to make of my illness. The depression was so bad for the last two years, perhaps due to my physical and mental symptoms. The unwanted thoughts were there then, but not so bad now. Still I think my neighbor’s are recording me, or that they can read my mind. Other visual thoughts are not as bad. They are trying to figure out what? I just dont know. I’m very on edge still even on 300mg 
of lyrica. I feel very on edge, restless strange and very tired. Two antipsychotics and lyrica and effexor for somataform disorder? Plus the anxiety and depression. Why do I need two antipsychotics if by all accounts, its somataform disorder. This I.can’t understand either. I’m going to be talking to my psychiatrist on the 19th, I’m going to ask questions again, but he will probably increase my medication if I start saying I think theres more to my illness:( I’m sick of it, because things just dont add up or make sense, unless my psychiatrist thinks, I’m psychotic or delusional. I dont know that I am. Thanks for your insight. Sorry too I was wrecked these last few days with the wooziness dizziness in my head."

I didn’t relapse, but I have had a very hard time. I am bound and determined to lose my excess weight even though I take Zyprexa, which is notorious for weight gain. Overall, I am doing so much better on it, and I am determined to be strong and get rid of my excess antipsychotic weight. I feel ready to do this now. It’s been going very well so far, I guess I should be lucky I am not gaining. It’s a lot of work but it’s been worth it so far. 16 pounds in 14 weeks is pretty good, but I’m like anyone else, I want it to be faster! _AT_MENTION_ How are things going on the Slimfast?

Sit down in a comfortable seat then take a deep breath. Slowly release. Do it a few times. then breathe normally with eyes shut the whole time. Concentrate on the breath, In and out. Within seconds your mind will stray. Don’t worry about it. Just slowly return to the breath. Keep doing this. In and out. Let the mind wander but return to the breath when you realise it. In just a matter of weeks you can slow thought. Give it a try! What do you have to lose?"

I asked her about my diagnosis because the psych hospital I had gone to (in another area of city which I don’t fall under anymore now I’m home) couldn’t diagnose me past a “working” diagnosis. I asked her if I still have sza and she said there’s a definite schizo (psychosis) element along with borderline and anxiety. Asked if it’s sz or sza and it could be either but probably more sza because of moods. However my moods could be due to borderline not sza, so I may have sz after all.

We are both sensitive to anti-depressants and I don’t know if that’s common with schizophrenia or schizoaffective. Like I can’t take SSRI’s because they elevate me way too much and then often worsen my depression by causing swings/or i don’t feel right on them. My mom’s having depression too and shes on haldol. I don’t know what would help her. She needs to bring up this more to her doc. but I want to help advocate. I also wonder if some of her medication complaints are moreso related to the illness.

174397628,"Well Abilify didn’t really work for my intrusive thoughts that others call ”delusions” They faded yes but not bc of the meds And I don’t currently believe in it so idk about changing meds yet I’m doing good( it’s 4pm here though), and yes I need to finish middle school (in my country it’s different)"
176215330,"I was on geodon for a while. Did wonders on my symptoms, I was nearly voice free on it. Lost a few pounds on it. My liver just couldn’t handle it, started getting pains, but that’s a very rare side effect. If it weren’t for the side effect, I’d still be on it."
176215331,Looooool that’s hilarious
176215332,"I’m happy for you brother, you deserve it. Shame they can’t back track the money you’re owed."
176215333,it saved me too.
176215334,Yes they will. Just give it a try
176215335,"“_NAME_ is waiting for you in the kitchen, with legs open.”"
176215336,"Honestly, yes. The same people who think that swapping out potatoes for wickedly expensive yet tasteless cauliflower is a good idea. Society needs to shun these wretches."
176215337,"I guess I missed the point. I thought it was an incidental fire, not that Rome was under siege. I missed a history lesson. I was never any good at history. Too upsetting."
176215338,No one takes such amounts of meds. Maybe I am an extreme and ridiculous case in the history of psychiatry
176215339,"I have some friends like that, some tell me that I don’t need meds and just pray to God. Others just tell me to think positive and no need for meds. They have no experience with mental illness."
176215340,So as most of you know i’ve been taking barber online classes. I’ve been trying to stay positive about it but it’s getting extremely difficult. I haven’t passed not 1 final exam and I’ve had 4 final exam and all have been failing grades. I’m struggling now more than ever. And I’m afraid that I might be dropped from the college because of my grades. I feel like I should put a pause on it until my head is straight and I’m ready to tackle this better. But then I’m worried about everyone saying that I just quit like always and that I’m failing at it like I do everything else. To make matters worse I really wanna talk about it with someone but have no one to talk to about it.
176215341,"When I used to take olanzapine in the day, I couldn’t function. Now I have a lesser dose and at night time, it knocks me out and I am always guaranteed a good nights sleep now"
176215342,"No I dont plan on running away. I plan on trying to get an improvement in my situation. I do like being here though, my mom is sweet she also suffers from schizophrenia and we get along really well, plus she’s always here to check on me. I just think I worry her too much, I’m 32 and despite loving this nice house, I need to be out on my own. I just dont have financial resources yet. I think I should also see a new psychiatrist. As soon as its 8:30 I’m gonna call another practice. My psychiatrist wont call me until May 10th. I have tried to call multiple times, left multiple voicemails, don’t even know what pills to take anymore. Threw out the anti-depressant."
176215343,"A little. I usually stick to 3-4 regular meals a day, but it’s good with a snack once in a while."
176215344,I managed five years off meds But it came back eight years ago. Tried coming off meds again without success. Sometimes this landed me in hospital. So I’m stuck on meds now
174397632,"No thanks, already got some."
174397634,You can try to go off your meds but if you start hearing voices you may need them again
176215345,no I would not.
176215346,I use MyFitnessPal and plan my days in advance so I just eat what I’ve logged in.
176215347,I think there might be something to this too. My uncle has psychosis possibly a second uncle too so there’s genetics but All my siblings have strong social lives and they never got psychotic Even my bro whose done more drugs than me But I have a weak social circle and I’m the one who got psychosis I have quite a lot of siblings but I’m the only one who got affected by the condition
176215348,I think there’s a chance that doubling my dosage of My increased Modafinil is helping. Past 2 days I’ve noticed a slightly better activity level. Socializing was a bit easier for me last night. Ive had some scattered moments of motivation. _PERSON_ had one shower more than typical. Thing is I stopped dividing the doses up and instead I put them together first thing in the morning and it seems better. I get energy for a bit of time. Wasn’t working before that. Gonna talk to my nurse and pdoc. Maybe I could even go up again soon and maybe that could help more. They will know if that’s ok
176215349,Yeah but then again us psychotics deserve to be in relationships. I go through periods where my insight goes away does that mean i should leave my partner?
176215350,You too! Congrats on working!

176215352,"I had those days. Days where all that kept me going was thinking I had to make some contribution to the world, and had to stay here until i did even with all my suffering and pain…thinking well I’m not alive to be happy…days where not even that was enough to keep me going and I just wanted death… But thankfully those days are over for me. It is all part of the journey towards recovery. Keep fighting for the life you dream of!! If you don’t fight you will never have it!!"
176215353,You have bipolar with depressive symptoms?

176215355,this beat is flame
176215356,"You definitely probably have delusions. The primary positive symptom of schizophrenia is hearing voices, although there are other types. If you’ve been diagnosed, you probably are."
176215357,"It possible. I dated 8 people, but most i didnt really have feelings for. My current relationship is difficult but he trying. He trying to work on his anger. Since i dont do good around people when they are angry. Do to what my dad did in his relationships as well as one of my friends whom i used to be around with. Anger is something that i dont handle well around. But my fiancee is trying not to get angry around me and i know it hard for him not to."
176215358,"Wow, I’m on 4.75mg and the first thing I did was quit exercising and ignoring good diet."

176215364,If you read my past threads ‘crazy coincidences’ ‘little help please’ and ‘help me rationalize this’ let me know what you think!

176215367,Wow it’s pretty complicated
174397642,You said you were on abilify for 10 years. What about going back to that? Or rexulti? I know vraylar didn’t suit you.

176215370,"No messiah complex, no religious delusions, no believing conspiracy theories. I just interpret daily interactions so wrong sometimes that it scares me. I can have a conversation with someone and walk away feeling like they complimented me and five minutes later realize they were putting me down and they meant something entirely different. Happens all the time. My theory is that all people are jealous of me because I am the most important person in the world and the whole world is conspiring to keep me down. And I have a sneaking suspicion god has something to do with it too."
176215371,I think I was a terrorist but no one has arrested me. I thought they were a year and a half ago so stayed at a b&b with my boyfriend and was safe. Now I think they want to take me to North Korea but I’m slowly getting over this.

176215374,There have been times when I’ve wondered about if I’ve been faking having a mental illness but I remember it’s not normal to have the symptoms I’ve experienced throughout my life. I’ve never had a normal life and my mental health just kept getting worse as I got older.

Some people would argue that would be worse than an on-the-side sex partner. But they’re both bad. Maybe reinforce your feelings for him by telling him how you feel about him. Idk…"
176215377,"Ahh, OK I see. That is tricky. It’s hard to empathise because that never happened to me."
176215378,So I have to live my life like this?

174397647,"I’m glad you can still work. I’m disabled mainly from the strength of the psychosis I was in. The last two years though, I haven’t been psychotic.

176215382,Or the most cunning !
176215383,"Nobody cares about anybody but their family and friends. These delusions make so little sense to me that I can’t even entertain them anymore. There are like 8 billion people on the planet, we’re ants, nobody cares. I know you’re not supposed to talk people out of delusions, so I won’t try, but life is so much easier when you don’t think people are coming to get you. I really wish this for my friends here on this site."
176215384,_AT_MENTION_. how are you today? Did you have a good Xmas? I didn’t get a lot of presents but I’m good with that. I didn’t even decorate. All that stuff is for kids’ enjoyment and there are no kids in my house. Sorry for derailing your thread.
176215385,"Okay lol But, if you are not a person, a place, or a thing, Then what are you ?"
176215386,Happy thanksgiving to all my friends in this forum…
176215387,"I don’t remember the years but immediately following 9/11 and a few years in middle school rate pretty high. As far as worst “months” or “weeks” go, I think I’ve had a rough couple weeks in the past month, or two that would rate pretty high. I’m glad thats over, I hope things turn for the better."
174397651,"My sister was 20 years old when first psychotic episode occurred. According our knowledge in our family there are no other relatives who suffer from schizophrenia. The symptoms of my sister during the first psychotic episode were: disorganized speech and impossibility to think and say sonething true and rational capgras delusion “those two people are not our parents but substitutes” impossibility to sleep and she never slept one minute for 2 days risperidone works for her and taking risperdal she had 3 years food, but when the doctor reduce risperdal she had a release and another psycotic episode Is It schizophrenia or should be another illness?"
176215388,I hope you all just end up with mild symptoms. Keep us posted.
176215389,How so Please explain I’m very curious to this method you speak… Maybe link some research If you can Since dystonia is the worst

176215393,Okay. Thanks for your reply
176215394,"I’ve been using _NAME_’s for awhile now, and one of my favorite things about them is that they donate 1% of sales to men’s mental health causes, though some of the groups are not explicitly just for males. I wish more companies would do this, or rather, I wish more people did this. I feel like we should be infinitely grateful for being born in this age and having as many resources and help that has brought great blessings to mental health sufferers. Upon reading the book, Hidden Valley Road, I became a lot more thankful for the medical care and opinions surrounding psychiatric medicine for this day and age. And while we still have a long way to go to beat firstly the illnesses, and the social _USER_ID_, I think we are on the right track and hopefully more companies can do this."
176215395,Nowhere near 40 for me. Counting both mental health housing (not hospitals) and private housing I’ve lived in about 12 cities and about 20 different houses or apartments. And I’m 58. That ain’t much moving.
176215396,I think it would go down well with your employers too.
176215397,Hey _NAME_ also my diagnosis . Yeah it really does suck I hear you but stay positive enjoy the days as they come .
174397646,Might as well be beef without nitrates… sighs
176215398,"I think diagnosis is not important. The important thing is if your evolution is good or not. I mean, if you take your meds, if meds work, if you have a healthy life…"
176215399,I recommend listening to them. I hope they can find out something useful from it. Sending you good vibes
176215400,"Yes, their usual topics are an endless _USER_ID_-of-war, but this is a new topic. There’s no use in ruining a new topic with things that were said in other topics. Lord knows I’ve written some posts I’m not proud of. I’d hate to see the ones afflicted hold onto those grudges. This forum has an ignore button. Use it. And don’t make your beef with this user a bigger problem than it is."
176215401,Try writing it down.
176215402,"Went shopping today. When I parked at the store and got out a woman walked up to me carrying a little sign saying she had no job and two kids to feed. She asked if I could spare a few bucks. The hilarious part is that someone posted on here just a couple days ago that they don’t give money to people who are begging who are better dressed then them. So that popped into my head and I looked closer at the way the lady was dressed and she was in nice sweats and nice sneakers and I actually said to her, “IDK. You’re better dressed than me.” Lol. But WTH, I just gave her a couple dollars, it’s not going to break me. Maybe when I die God will give me a better seat in heaven at the dinner table for being so nice."
174397654,How? Which meds are you on?
176215403,"Not yet, but I might be headed that way. I am getting money, but I can’t even remember what’s it called."
176215404,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton, you have to understand this- you post the same question over and over with different titles. You claim you want answers and refuse to listen to us. It irritates members to see this. So you’re going to get irate members posting or eventually just ignored. Your question is best answered by your pdoc. We have done all we can."

174397648,Thats good. I worry about my cognition
176215407,"For some people, it is the cure. For example, some studies have discovered that for some, gluten was causing the psychosis. This isn’t a cure for everyone, but like I say, it is for some. We all individually need to find out the cause of our psychosis. Unfortunately, it may be beyond science at the moment. I believe that for me, I’m harboring some occult infection."
174397652,Im on clozapine as well since 7 years. The sleepiness never develop tolerance. I still sleep for 12-15 hours at night. Im thinking about changing my meds

I Can drink 1-2 Cop coffee a day, and i dont feel nothing But over 3 Cops or energy drink i Can feel something happens, i hear voices everyday and if drink to mutch caffeine the voices get louder and i will start takling to myself. So it have an effect on me. But not like drugs its only a mild effect. I Think in large doses it Can, but not in small doses. But its not the best thing to drink, if you have schizophrenia, biopolar, or drug included psychosis But in small doses its almost harmless."

My worst symptoms were agitation/irritability which made me violent sometimes with my family. Lower dose meds didnt work, neither weaker meds, only Risperdal worked out of Abilify, Risperdal, Latuda, Seroquel and Zyprexa.

174397663,"I ruin everything. EVERYTHING. I also hate myself. You may remember that I cost my university a thousand dollars because of emergency visits. I asked if I could pay for it, but they payed for it instead. They kicked me out because I was too “mentally unstable” and because I was “mentally ill”. They kicked me out because I had schizophrenia. They put me on judicial hold and kept an eye on me because of my schizophrenia. They hated me. This is why I can’t depend on anyone. I ruin everything. I’m a burden. I feel like I ruin everything and I’m just a stupid dumba*s. I feel like a super big burden to everything and everyone. I deserve to die. I deserve to be shredded to dust and be torn into a million pieces. I deserve to be punished because I’m such a disgusting and horrible burden. They hated me because I’m sz. A sz who is a burden on everyone. i hate myself. i hate hate hate hate hate myself. If I stay alive for a long time, the longer I’ll be a burden on everyone. I just really 
want to harm myself and tear myself into pieces. I hate it. Why can’t I be normal? Why can’t I be a good person? Why am I so disgusting? I can’t help but hate myself. I’m trying to love myself but I just want to tear myself apart. I’m a ??????? piece of burden."

In the past when I have gone off medications it has usually taken about a month and a half or so before I got a relapse again, and then I would have to take megadoses of ap’s for a while to get back to normal. Totally zombified which is not recommended. Hopefully you don’t do the same mistake I did. However I didn’t have courage to join a support group before just a few weeks ago. I had no one to talk to about my symptoms or troubles in the past which is silly. I wish I joined this group 10 years ago so I could get advise to better my situation.

176215446,I’m described as mostly in remission with some breakthrough psychosis . Most stubborn is the bedtime people going to get in/are in my flat one. There’s a ‘sensing a presence’ element to that that can also happen during the day . Much of it is totally illogical. For example when I go to bed I put the light on to check if there’s anyone in the bedroom. Like why would a homicidal maniac wait patiently in the bedroom. Then there are the thoughts that cross my mind which if held with absolute conviction would probably be delusional. A COVID based one - COVID are aliens trying to take over the world .
176215447,Well done to you. I didn’t really abuse them but as you know I came off them because of a health concern. I’ve done really well and sometimes still get a bit anxious but I deal with it mostly. Good luck. I think your in the good part of the process after that long.

174397686,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The primacy of cognition in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, The American psychologist , Apr 2005 Cognitive tasks and concepts are used increasingly in schizophrenia science and treatment. Recent _NAME_-analyses show that across a spectrum of research domains only cognitive measures distinguish a majority of schizophrenia patients from healthy people. Average effect sizes derived from common clinical tests of attention, memory, language, and reasoning are twice as large as those obtained in structural magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies. Chronic stress, genes, brain disturbances, task structure, gender, and sociocultural background may all enhance the sensitivity of cognitive performance to schizophrenia. At the same time, disease heterogeneity and the presence of endophenotypes and subtypes within the patient population may place upper limits on the strength of any specific cognitive finding. Schizophrenia is a complex biobehavioral disorder that manifests 
itself primarily in cognition. I know a lot of people don’t have cognition issues here. If you tinker with your meds without a docs consent you just might screw yourself mentally. Really all day I just look up stuff on pubmed. I’m hoping it could somehow translate to studying something at a college. I would just be reading books all day if I could actually comprehend them."
176215494,"I’m open minded. I think time travel is possible. But I think that way of thinking, for you, is really dangerous because of your delusions. It’s kind of like me and the paranormal. Is it possible that there are ghosts? Totally. Should I think about it all day long and freak myself out? No. It’s a possibly true belief that I just can’t subscribe to because of my illness. I have to push those thoughts away. You should do the same, for your health."

176215512,"Ahhhh… You separate the person and the hallucinations. You see the person as good. When you say they have “malicious urges” or “malignant feelings”, you mean the hallucinations themselves are a sort of “separate entity” that is malicious and wants to harm the person with sz or their surroundings. And they should prevent that this influences their behaviour. Otherwise they will really do harmful things. Yes??? And maybe when you say malicious you mean harmful?

That’s a positive thing in your life. In my case, I find that people think if I share an opinion they assume I expect them to agree with me. I don’t, not at all. I value other people’s opinions and enjoy hearing them. But not everyone is like that. And I find if I share a differing opinion, problems ensue. So I just stay mute usually. If I’m really comfortable with someone I’ll share some of my opinions though."

I’ve lived away from home three times. once in college for 3 years. and then I moved to Oregon when I was in my 20’s for a year. loved it each time, I didn’t have any roommates or many friends when I was in Oregon, so I did get a little homesick.

174397687,Has the abilify helped your intrusive thoughts?
174397692,"Um, that’s exactly the (false) root of _USER_ID_ against schizophrenics. Study after study shows that we are no more dangerous or violent than the so-called “normies”. Our rate of violence is about the same as the general population. We are actually more likely than the general population to be victims of violence. The reason people think we are so dangerous is largely because of the reporting in the media. People don’t care or hear that I have schizophrenia and I’ve worked for the last 30 years and never been violent. What they hear mostly is the occasional story of a minority of schizophrenics who commit bizarre murders or mass shootings. And since most people don’t care about schizophrenia unless it affects them personally (like a relative or friend or someone else they know having it) all the general population knows about it is when the media senseationilizes the rare gruesome murder by a schizophrenic who the chances are good that these schizophrenics were not on medication and th
ey had been isolating or doing drugs or grew up with violent tendencies before they even got sick. These stories are the ones that stick in peoples minds and shapes their perceptions of schizophrenia and that’s exactly why people fear us when we don’t want them to and perpetuates the negative treatment we get."

176215526,There is a high probability that Trazodona 100mg causes dyskinesia right? My tongue movements are worse. I take low dose of AP. I didn’t take trazodona for months. 1 month ago i started taking trazodona again at night. My dyskinesia is at night. Now i’m thinking that AP and specially trazodona is the major cause.
176215527,What dose of Beta Alanine did you take? 1500mg acts like a horse tranquilizer for me. _USER_ID_: taurine and beta alanine shouldn’t be taken together as they cancel each other out.
176215528,It’s meds for life for me. Best function is the key. Get meds that make your life better and doses where your dealing with your positives over side effects…you take as much as you need to overcome your demons whilst keeping some interest over the side effects where you can function. That is the key. As I say. Relationships move from there. I thought sex was everything and it’s good…don’t get me wrong but your better than most folk for sure. Keep your chin up and start moving forward. Your obsessing and it really won’t be too much of an issue from what I’ve found…

176215557,_PERSON_ its best to break free from these thoughts are you taking medication at the moment?
176215558,"I think you should focus on trying to get good sleep, because poor sleep catalyses a lot of other moods like depressions and feeling tired and unmotivated. Go to bed at regular times, avoid blue lights, mobiles the last hour before you go to bed. Maybe eat something like oatmeal and have a hot cup of cocoa before bed, that might have a calming effect. I wouldn’t use drugs to get you sleep more though, because drug induced sleep is far from as good as natural sleep."
176215559,I prefer generic Risperdal. Brand name was too potent for me. It messed with certain hormones too much. My prolactin levels are a lot lower on the generic.

176215570,"Am I the only one here who went cold? I went asocial too, avoidant, running from the others because I feel my somatics from too much stress… I guess some people saw me as a psychopath too, yeap… I went verbally aggressive for a time. Am not proud of this… But for a very long time, I felt so hellishly unloved, that I turned unhuman… Me too, I was confused on experiencing love too, strange thing… Now I see how my mom keeps helping me etc, so I hope ill feel loved one day.

176215582,"Hey friend. Try not to bash yourself. You ate more than you needed to. It wasn’t ideal for your health. But it doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. You’re still an amazing person who deserves love and respect. You especially deserve love and respect from yourself. Next time, you can put a few pieces in a bowl, to help you with portion control. But try to approach it like “I love myself enough to make sure I eat mostly nutritious foods” as opposed to “I’m such a loser who eats chocolate.” If you try to motivate yourself through self-hatred, you’re setting yourself up for failure. Because half your energy is going into just bullying yourself."

176215600,"You really have a talent for where to apply what kind of shade, I envy that. Well done!"
176215601,That must be because cigarettes were like 3 dollars a pack back in the day. And _NAME_ had that Road House money. Sure Ghost was cool and all but Road House… or maybe it is just that I saw those movies as a kid and Ghost didn’t appeal to me as much at that age.
176215602,no working is impossible… i’m on permanent disability. I still try to change it but it’s hard. I try to go out once a month with the help of mobile team girl and/or my father. I don’t have many friends anymore. I have one good friend but he lives in scotland. Close by i lost my friends cause i’m a bit awkward socially and they all got good lives now like partner and kids so they don’t have time to talk to somebody like me. It’s weird that your paranoia gets worse around others huh… i think i got the same but it depends who i am with.
176215603,Take the compliments my friend. You sure do know it if you do something wrong or they have a bad mood they’ll be anything but kind. Anyways. Well done on the positive reinforcement.

176215606,Maybe you’re a sociopath. You should read about the differences. Someone I love very dearly is a sociopath. But she does fine. She’s still a human being that deserves love and respect. She just goes through this world a little differently than others. And there are plenty of them out there. Drs and Lawyers and CEOs and such.
176215607,"Hey there, i think it is a “normal” human response to have anger, acting out and blunted feelings of empathy if you were abused. Im sorry you went through that. Im really happy your dad did act loving! I have had an inpatient treatment for complex ptsd and loads of us had anger, rage and numbness. One girl told me she felt like a “robot” before treatment and learned in this program to feel again. So i hope you dont feel ashamed of it…it isnt your fault. I hope you can cope."

I am in charge and I will see to it that I regain my life and get control of my problems, safely and effectively. You can all do the same thing, period.

176215644,"I would buck up and stay on 10mg for a little while, a couple of weeks maybe so that you get enough drugs in your system to make sure you don’t relapse when reducing. Personally I never had any signs of relapse with doses 7.5mg or higher. But this is ofcourse individual. I am currently doing 5mg which has been mostly working for me recent years. There is a notable difference though between 10mg and 7.5mg so it might make it better, but don’t expect too much. If you feel that olanzapine isn’t the right drug for you I think it would be wise to try a different med rather sooner than later(many years). It can be difficult to switch later if your body gets too accustomed to a drug. But give it a go and see how it turns out."

I’m not exactly sure who they are. Women have always lied about me around here, because they don’t like competition. Men who lie about women, are angry that women aren’t attracted to them. Then there’s people trying to malign the mentally ill. ."

176215710,My previous metal health trust was big on character assassination and low on giving help and support. I’ve heard the treatment of those later found to to be(also)on the spectrum leaves a lot to be desired.

176215712,Their problem… Not yours.
176215713,_PERSON_ sorry maybe it was a wrong choice of words. I have plenty of weird beliefs my self just wanted to make a point.
176215714,I had a depressive break at 23. It had some serious paranoia but I didn’t go psychotic. Dxed 29. Before that…severe ocd from primary school and racing thoughts from as long as I can remember…I was just paranoid enough to cause problems with long relationships. I blamed a lot of other things but it was sz all along. For me diagnosis made sense.
176215715,its was a legendary game.
176215716,I find talking about it to my husband or sister or mom helps Listening to cheerful music helps too I love reading when I’m able to And a back scratch from my husband is always something that cheers me up Also to write down a gratitude list or pray to God thanking Him for whatever I can think of that I’m grateful for
176215717,I have an itch That I can’t scratch. What would it have Been like?

174397734,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I was seeing dead corpses with worms at night and blood in my bathtub and walls in the morning.
176215720,I cannot make decisions when I am not thinking straight as people always tell me. I will have to wait it out and see. If I gave up now it would end years worth of effort in gaining independence
176215721,Unfortunately it is actually the exact same for me. Mother also. The constantly get derogatory comments and aggression against me. Belittled regularly too. It’s toxic in every way. Very manipulative.
174397737,"I never took meds last night. I’ve been crappy all day. No blood pressure med, no Singulair for my asthma and allergies, no Saphris for voices, no Topamax for mood stabilization and no cholesterol pill. No wonder I feel so crappy. Tomorrow is going to be a much better day for sure. It’s so strange, I usually can’t fall asleep without my Saphris. I guess I was just so tired from having the babies all day."

176215727,Hi _AT_MENTION_-- hope all is well with you now
176215728,"All the friggin time I’m fighting the thoughts that people don’t want me there or don’t like me. I’m constantly saying the wrong thing… I mean I know my thoughts at times aren’t real, but they feel bloody real! So what’s the difference because I can’t think differently I can’t snap out of it"
174397731,"So far no. I have gone 39 years keeping it a secret. That and I wasn’t really aware myself that it was Schizophrenia. Well I had my first symptoms at 5 yrs old. My mother told me few days ago not to tell my Aunt. My family doesn’t know. She told me they wouldn’t understand but I’m not so sure. My mother knew I think. I told her and my grandmother I was seeing things early on. I was misdiagnosed a lot. (Rapid cycling bi-polar 1disorder with psychosis, autism, etc) before I received proper diagnosis . I kept my symptoms quiet because my mother’s best friend was diagnosed with it and my mom was scared of her. I didn’t want my mom scared of me. A lot of bad things happened to me growing up and I didn’t know how to communicate to my mom or anyone so it made things worse. I’m just now opening up to people and one of my friends from Jr. High said she kinda figured I was schizophrenic. She loves me anyways and it doesn’t change anything about how she feels for me. So far the people that m
atter still care. If anyone doesn’t believe the diagnosis it’s because they don’t really know me and I’m reclusive anyways."
176215729,"I remember being a kid and being very rude to others. Not always, but some memories are etched into the psyche. Could it be karma that I have sz?"
176215730,Does any one else have it where the voices say that they are gods and that they are the weakest being out of every one that ever lived. They even held a tribunal in my head like a court hearing and that iam the only one that failed there test and me and my family is going to hell forever the get tortured. It’s all over ciggorets that it was what determined me to be the weakest being cuz I couldn’t quit. They have been playing games in my head saying that they are spirit and the earth is going to ascend into heaven. It’s all been a crazy story with it going on for three years with coicidents being In the media and the news about me and crowds of people being controled does any one else have this it feels like iam the only one and I dont want to to go to hell forever.

174397730,"I cannot remember ANYTHING from 1989 (birth) to 2013 (estimate). I’m 30 years old and it’s 2020. I have fake or false memories combined with grandiosity. I have no clue what happened to me. It’s like I follow the same old story or script in this time loop. For me, it feels like I’m in an eternal causal loop/time loop. Like the universe resets including my body, mind, memory, spirit, soul, and consciousness. According to my original story, I did some drugs in 2011 and became dissociated and experienced psychosis. I dropped out of college in 2011. Then everything is a blur since 2013. I think in 2014 I had a marijuana card for my Aspergers and started getting paranoia again. Then in 2015, I had my worst psychotic break. In 2016, I “hallucinated” some military UFOs and became unstable and psychotic again. I have fears of the mental hospital and the future. It seems like, according to my psychosis, I die and come back alive, only waking up or restarting my life in 2013 onward. 2013 is my be
st estimate. I rather not get into my details and go down the rabbit hole again. I often say and think I’m a super soldier who experiences consciousness transfer or time travel. I can literally sense my soul going backwards in time into my body to the year 2013. I have a million other thoughts, which I won’t talk about right now. I have confabulation I think because I cannot remember things really. It’s not on purpose. Some people call it amnesia or false memory syndrome. It seems super, super real to me. I often think the government gave me schizophrenia. If it wasn’t them, maybe it was aliens…? I don’t know. Sometimes I doubt I even have schizophrenia, but then I see and think I have been disabled for 9 years and HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING during that time. To me, that means I got something really, really wrong with me. I used to be normal and high functioning. I really don’t see a positive future for myself."

176215736,"_AT_MENTION_ , I suffered from thought broadcasting and thought insertion for 33 years and many of those years I had CBT therapy.

176215739,"If you have Parkinson’s disease you could try adding black pepper to your b1 supplements to help absorption. Take b1 in the morning an hour before your caffeine fix. Take it with black pepper. Turmeric can’t be absorbed without black pepper. Black pepper increased turmeric absorption by something like 500%. So I’m thinking if you take b1, avoid caffeine for an hour and take it with black pepper. This is just my opinion though, but it makes sense. If you have a b1 deficiency, this may help."

174397747,20mg was too heavy for me. I felt like a zombie. I’m on 15mg now and that’s ok.
176215741,"When I used to drink I usually skipped medication because I would get serious interactions that made my head really foggy the next day. Even if I just drank a couple of beers close to medication time I could feel that I got interactions. It basically made the next day less enjoyable. Now I have more or less given up drinking and I think it was a great move, especially considering I have to take meds every day. My days have more quality over them without alcohol."

176215750,Sz is a human body disease and not a soul disease for me.
174397742,"So today wasn’t the best. I noticed my medicine wearing off early, I’ve been experiencing symptoms like apathy and fatigue and I had to leave work because it was so overwhelming and I felt so unwell. So I need the Abilify injection every 3 weeks now. I talked to the on call doctor at Inpatient Mental Health and this is what she recommended."
174397744,I bet with Vraylar it would work better. I feel like my body is getting short bursts of energy that don’t last long. Its like a car trying to start. On Abilify the energy bursts were constant. Also its just happening at night when antipsychotic blood level is lower. I need to find a way without stopping meds.
176215751,"I’ve had really bad experiences with cops since I was really young. I don’t trust them at all. Plus they never do anything to help. When we got robbed, they took a report at the house and that was it. We never heard from them again. They’re useless. And mean. And abusive - severely so, especially if young girls."
176215752,You might not suffer paranoia like me… mine is in form of intrusive thoughts… i think about going crazy even though id never do such things…
174397745,"I quickly excise overly religious people from my life, period. I don’t care why they’re that way, I just need them gone for my own peace of mind."
176215753,Don’t think you are always going to feel this way. Things can change. You can find a sense of purpose in unexpected places. A lot of the time when you feel the most miserable you can suddenly be surprised by a sense of purpose.

176215768,Yes I was referring to the antipsychotics I’ve taken. It wasn’t like that in the first few years. Lately my body is so used to them that I have withdrawals when I stop taking them.

176215781,Actually I don’t know for certain. 5 years ago I went nuts because Vraylar made me manic and psychotic. I may have gotten psychotic because I came off of Risperdal too quickly and experienced rebound psychosis. This time going down on my dose very slowly. I’ve been on doses lower than 3mg with few problems before. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ Doing well with no Depakote

174397751,When I took clozapine in 2004 it gave me severe side effects like drooling (I had to wrap a towel around my pillow) and severe drowsiness. I slept from 9pm till 10am and sometimes till 2pm. Once in hospital I didn’t go to toilet before bed and woke up with a wet bed. I didn’t like it and asked to be switched to another med. To risperidone which within a few months caused me to go slowly into remission
176215789,300 mg quetiapine at night and 25mg twice a day here. I need at least 12 hours sleep on the stuff and plenty of decent coffee. You will get a tolerance after a while tho - so you wont always feel so sleepy.
176215790,Yeah I’m eating low GI foods because most of the foods I eat contain higher amounts of fiber. Believe it or not although I’m limiting certain healthy fats in my diet I am not excluding all fats. Try following a low carb diet like the Mediterranean diet or try following an anti inflammatory diet.

174397757,"I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and have taken amisulpride for seven years. I’ve been on 200-600mg I’ve discovered that 200mg is my minimum dose. If I go to 100mg I relapse On 200mg I do fairly well but sometimes especially in stress times I relapse (getting depression, or self harming, or hypomania or hearing voices) and if I do I increase it to 300mg for a few days and it helps a lot In the times I relapsed and needed to go to hospital because for severe depression and voices I was taking 200mg and when they increased it to 400mg I recovered very quickly. This happened with at least three or four hospitalisations so now I know the pattern and increase it myself to try and avoid hospital. So far I’ve been out of hospital for one and a half years It’s an excellent calming med!"
176215796,Do whatever you feel is best for you and will keep you safe. Best of luck.
176215797,This is a great idea. If I don’t write a script I am all over the place
176215798,Maybe you should give these drugs a try and see if they suit your needs. If you’re med compliant and they don’t work out you can try something different.
176215799,"I’m happy that you’re well _AT_MENTION_ that’s good news. Hope it stays that way. I’m doing OK I suppose.

176215801,"I wish it would go away, but like I said, it could be psychosomatic. Maybe I can learn about myself by getting to the bottom of this."
176215802,Mate. It’s like all you hit on the internet. Do you learn from interacting. That could be interesting! I’ve met people I’ve met online in mental health chats before. Was interesting but nothing more!
176215803,I don’t know. I don’t mind it. I’m a drinker.
174397758,"Side effects for Invega aren’t noticeable to me really. Unless you want to talk about depression that may be due to the lack of dopamine and serotonin, but that comes with all antipsychotics."
176215804,Do something you enjoy and that makes you relax.
176215805,It’s fine if you need it. It’s better than suffering.
176215806,"If this has been an ongoing issue that won’t resolve, it might be time to rethink having a television set. I don’t know how you can concentrate on any movies or television shows if your fearing for you life."

176215810,"By reality, which I bracketed in the title, I meant (as explained above) intersubjective, shared reality. In short, I question whether this shared reality has any basis in fact."

176215812,"Again, antipsychotics should not be shamed. It can help people!"

174397765,"I liked it, wish I had the motivation to read more of it."

176215815,"There are so many smokers who want to quit smoking at the assisted living center where I live. I smoked about five cigarettes a day while I was in the army, and I was able to quit. But if you’re smoking a pack a day it is much harder. I also dipped tobacco for a couple of years, and I was able to quit that. It would dissolve the glue that held my bridge on in my mouth. Dipping is probably every bit as bad as smoking. I was running during the time I was dipping, and my wind was much better when I hadn’t dipped for 10 -12 hours."

176215821,"I took Melatonin 6mg every night for years to help me sleep and it worked pretty darn well. Then I read a post on this forum that if you take it chronically, your body quits producing it naturally and you grow dependent upon the pills. So, two nights ago, I stopped the Melatonin and took 1 mg of Klonipin instead, albeit at 6 am, and finally fell asleep and slept well waking at 2 pm. Last night, I couldn’t sleep again, only this time I took 1 mg of Klonipin at 1030 pm and woke at 800 am getting good sleep. Tonight, I tried sleeping without the Klonipin with no luck. I went to bed at 1030 pm and by 12 midnight still wide awake. At that point, I took 0.5 mg of Klonipin. It is now 250 am and I’m still awake despite lying quietly in bed for hours. I tried reading. No help. I don’t know what to do."

174397762,Abilify worked well for me except for terrible early-morning awakening. I was ready for the new day at 3 am every day which kind of sucks cuz everybody else is still asleep. I’m still on it and take my car for rides around town when I wake up that early. I didn’t have any weight change on it which was a relief after zyprexa’s massive weight gain.

It felt like it was saying about me:A. I wasnt alone in the persecutory feelings and B. that people worse than me were ‘out to get me’. And to watch for entertainment. The sorrow about it though is that the movie was important enough to me; and the thoughts only came from within. From me.

176215933,"One week prior to my first psychosis, I ingested a large dose of LSD. It must have been ~500mcg+. I experienced loss of ego, self and my conscious beliefs. I was unable to verbalise much. I didn’t know my name or who I was, nor did I know where I was from. It wasn’t a negative experience. But there were elements that scared me. Now, one way of looking at this was that due to the intensity of this experience, my belief system (at least at a conscious level) was ”loosened” and thrown in to my unconscious. It’s possible that this also happened to my sub-conscious beliefs. My ego/self and beliefs returned gradually as I neared the end of the trip. However I feel that it is possible that whatever “metaphysical glue” was fixing those beliefs to their respective containers (full and/or sub-conscious) was loosened. Or made softer and more malleable. Therefore, when one week later, I was exposed to stressors, one of those sub-conscious beliefs (my partial awareness around the principle of reci
procity) came “un-stuck” and transitioned from my sub-conscious to my conscious mind. Where initially it presented a “pressure” that I was consciously aware of. That I observed and attempted to analyse in context of all of my other knowledge and beliefs. Finally, through research and talking to people – I managed to put a name to this particular belief or principle. My next two psychoses were triggered by my becoming aware of certain strange or bizarre things that were unexpected. These were not social constructs like Reciprocity – but nevertheless they were things that I had not previously experienced. Things that made me feel threatened. And I believe that this is the other “required attribute” for a person to progress from simply delusional due to a lack of knowledge, all the way in to a psychosis. I believe that there needs to be some kind of threat to their well-being or sanity. One that might begin as mild worry, progress to paranoia then make its way in to full on paranoid psychosis. Fi
nally, Within my fourth psychosis, I believe that I had lost site of the Reciprocity principle once again, and in doing so did not handle a situation in the most appropriate way, causing retaliation and fear which had flow on impacts."

174397807,"I’m terribly sorry to hear you experienced the _USER_ID_ that comes with our illness. The _USER_ID_ of the diagnosis we are given has even caused people who were once considered close friends to distance themselves from us. Because of ignorance and the media’s portrayal of schizophrenia, when a person hears the word schizophrenia, they do not realize that by far the wide majority of us are not prone to unprovoked acts of violence. Sadly, people hear the word schizophrenia and are suddenly afraid that at any given moment we can explode. It is caused by ignorance about what schizophrenia actually is and what people with schizophrenia are actually like. Sure many of us prefer to be in our own comfort zone often our residence. Many of us isolate. Quite a few of us have poor social skills. Some of us have a flat effect and though we do not realize it, some of us do not express emotions the way others do. Quite a few of us are quiet and have trouble conversing with others at any given time. Heck, som
etimes we laugh at things others do not find funny. Most of us prefer to stay away from crowded places. In public we prefer not to be noticed. Sometimes we are afraid people are looking at us. And quite honestly, our minds sort of work differently than the average person. But all that does not mean that we are all violent. Nor does it mean we don’t like to socialize. As a schizophrenic, having a friends means something important to us. Even if sometimes we have trouble finding things to say in a conversation, that does not always mean we don’t want to talk with people, it just means sometimes we prefer to listen… matter of fact find a subject we are passionate about and sometimes we don’t shut up about it once we open up. It is even better when the topic has a common interest with those talking to us. In the end, we’re really just people. So I’m sorry you had to go through that, but keep your chin up my friend."

But hardships is not an excuse for God to spare us as we still need to live a sin free life as God’s judgement is fair. Each one’s life situations and ability can differ as there is rich and poor, active and disabled, handicapped and many but all need to live sin free. Its easy for the disabled to remain sin free when compared with the rich. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.

176215978,"Everything was normal until my mom frantically called me saying my younger brother was in the hospital because he had been found at school with a bag of xanax in his pocket.

Thankfully that was not the case and he claimed to have not taken any at all that day he had just accidentally forgotten they were in that pair of pants. I had a talk with him and it is so hard…he is a typical teen. Thinks he is not a typical teen, that he is somehow immune to all bad things and that drug use is perfectly safe for him because he is “smart” and “normal” drug users are dumb. (His words) I tried to get him to question that and told him if he really wanted to be different and smart he would realize that anything could happen to him because everyone thinks bad things won’t happen to them. I also tried to get him to realize that if he n
eeds drugs to get through the day, then he probably wasn’t actually doing better as he said he was. He still needed help and for adjustments to be made. He said “I’m not self medicating anymore I’m just doing it for fun.” But then he’d say things like how it was how he could deal with school and it helped with his anxiety and I was like you realize that IS self medicating?? Anyways he is a mess. He thinks all his problems will be solved once he can move out and go to college but he is not thinking that if he has drug charges on his record and bad grades because he is not taking care of himself and doing his work that he will not be able to get into a 4 year college and get out of the house.

174397821,"PubMed Central (PMC) Neurophysiological mechanisms of cortical plasticity impairments in... Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in cortical plasticity that affect sensory brain regions and lead to impaired cognitive performance. Here we examined underlying neural mechanisms of auditory plasticity deficits using combined behavioural... Because d-serine is a low-potency NMDAR agonist, its specific clinical utility is likely limited. Nevertheless, the present findings suggest first that NMDAR agonists as a class may be useful in potentiating plasticity during auditory remediation training and, second, that the auditory plasticity paradigm may be useful in evaluating potential novel treatment approaches. In addition, while the large majority of NMDAR agonist studies in schizophrenia have utilized continuous treatment with NMDAR agonists for therapeutic intervention, the present study supports episodic (once weekly) intervention for cognition enhancement. Moreover, plasticity-based remediation tar
geting auditory deficits is reported to improve not only auditory-level function, but also higher-level processes such as verbal working memory and global cognitive function ( _PERSON_ et al. , 2009 ; _PERSON_ , 2012 ). In previous studies, alterations in neurophysiological responses were observed following ?30–50 h of training ( _PERSON_ et al. , 2012 ; _NAME_ , 2016 ). A noteworthy result of the present study is that we observed neurophysiological improvement following only two sessions paired with an NMDAR agonist. Because of the different interventions, the comparability between the sets of findings is uncertain, and future studies are required to determine whether similar effects will be observed in combination with the types of targeted exercises that have been used previously for long-term auditory remediation. Finally, an interesting result from the present study is that the magnitude of effect was significantly larger in patients with schizophrenia who received two consecutive days of d-serine than 
it was in those who only received an initial administration. Similar paradoxical effects have also been noted in rodent investigations, suggesting that greatest effects are on consolidation rather than initiation of long-term potentiation ( _PERSON_ et al. , 1994 ; _PERSON_ et al. , 2001 ; _PERSON_ , 2014 ). The time course of the present effects may be best explained by an emerging literature suggesting that long-term potentiation occurs in two different phases—an initial NMDAR-induced increase in AMPA receptor trafficking that occurs over minutes, followed by a delayed increase in NMDAR trafficking that occurs over hours (consolidation) ( _PERSON_ , 2004 ). An increase in NMDAR trafficking would also potentially account for the ‘priming’ effect observed in the present study whereby both physiological and behavioural effects were much larger following two consecutive treatments of d-serine than following a single day. Our results are also consistent with d-cycloserine studies suggesting efficacy only w
hen an NMDAR agonist is given on the first session ( _NAME_ , 2011 ), and overall suggest the need for further investigations into the most effective timing of NMDAR-based intervention relative to plasticity-based treatment."

176216037,"Hi. This is my first post. So hello. My name’s _NAME_, and I recently got diagnosed. I wanted to ask if someone had experiences with hallucinations in photographs. For example, lets say I see a photo of person A where he had a cast on his arm. And over the next month or so every photo I see of him, he has the cast on his arm. And the month after that, photos of him don’t have the cast anymore. I would be safe to assume he had a cast during those months right? Are hallucinations so persistent that you can see them every time you look at the photographs, even new ones? Say, I see the photos with the cast all the same even a year after, though I’m guessing if its not there then I am delusional and seeing them as a result of this delusion. I know the best way to reality test is to just check with others, but outside of that, does anyone have experiences of this sort?"

I was also previously on Amisulpride so from experience it’s not such a bad drug, but do get onto a depot injection, I would recommend others to also take the drugs in depot form, taking [oral] medication leads to unstable levels of the drug in the blood and if you forget to take it, this can cause trouble.

176216043,i don’t think it’s possible to diagnose a person with just 50 questions… it’s good for an indication maybe but i think you need to be observed over some time to diagnose you for real…

I felt pretty ok moodwise, just felt that I was on the brink of death, like all the time. Just like pain compounded, constantly. I attribute my multivitamin to that.

174397842,"I used to be a drug addict and ended up going to a residential treatment center for addiction. It helped immensely, but didn’t really do much about the mental illness causing the drug problem in the first place. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times, and the longest I’ve ever stayed was 2 weeks, the typical stay for me is 5 days, and at least in my state the hospitals are always geared more toward people with depression and other more common mental illnesses, the only thing they do about schizo is give you meds, they don’t teach you how to deal with your symptoms or how to get back into society and be able to cope at work or anything. I’ve also gone to outpatient programs, and they didn’t help very much either, the therapists never have any advice except “take antipsychotics”. Antipsychotics don’t fix everything. It’s very hard for someone like me to get integrated into society without some sort of help. I want to gain the skills required to contribute to society and live independently
, but I’m not sure how to do that. Everything I’ve tried hasn’t worked. During my last really long psychotic episode my family was wanting to get me into a place like the drug treatment center I went to, only one for mental illness. I think a place like that, where you can actually go outside, you can have some of your own things, you’re busy doing programs meant to help you recover most of the day instead of milling around most of the time like in the mental hospital, would be much more helpful, and more bearable for a long term stay than in psychiatric unit and I think that’s what I need. Every job I’ve gotten I’ve gotten fired from because of my illness despite being on meds. I really need a place that can help me learn the skills needed to function normally in society, and short term hospitals just don’t do that, or help much in regards to schizoaffective at all. We found some RTCs for mental health, such as _NAME_ Riis, and they sounded like they would be extremely helpful for helping peo
ple like me be able to function in society and live independently. But the places we found don’t take insurance, and they are INSANELY expensive, there isn’t an option for low income people. Yet there are RTCs for drug addicts that aren’t that expensive and that take insurance. I’m just wondering if anyone knows of any places like this that are cheap in the US. The location doesn’t matter, if it takes insurance or isn’t crazy expensive. Does anyone have experience with a place like this? Do they even exist?"

I feel like I can start studying again and retain the knowledge. instead of forgetting it in a month or two. before I couldn’t even remember what I had for breakfast. also im becoming a better listener, I don’t know why this is. maybe because I have less going on in my head these days.

174397862,Society considers your schizophrenia symptoms to be frightening and will take any steps possible to lessen them. If the drug made you more of a man they would be also scared of you spreading your seed around. It’s sorta a milder eugenics than what they used to have as they will let you have kids if you are able too. But it’s very difficult to do so with those side effects. It’s nearly impossible if your schizophrenia symptoms are extreme as well to raise kids. So they pretty much have you either way. You are right. Doctors care little about those side effects. The bottom line is if your “positive” symptoms are better.

If you’re low income, the Pell Grant is given every fall and spring semester and can be gotten by filling out the FAFSA each year. Other grants require a bit of searching just to see what’s available and generally are performance based, meaning you have to keep your grades up. Also, check out your school’s disability resource center, as there are plenty of scholarships out there for disabled people, but the applications for these can be tedious and, honestly, there seems to be many more available for folks with physical disabilities. The resources are out there but require a bit of digging and work to get them but it’s well worth it if you don’t ever have to get loans that bog you down."

176216221,"Here are my hospital stories (voluntary admissions only): I started having hallucinations, and I told my friend who was a psych major. She said I need to see a psychiatrist, so I tried to find one. Everyone was booking out at least 6 months, but one of the receptionists told me if I had a hospital admission, they would be able to fit me in next week. So I checked into the hospital. I was ignored in a waiting room for 18 hours, so I stood up in front of the main desk to wait. The staff did NOT like this and told me if I didn’t sit down they would throw out all my stuff. Mind you, I wasn’t saying or doing anything. Just standing silently in front of the desk. After 5 minutes of that, they suddenly managed to find me a room. They gave me pills, I fell asleep, and then in the morning they sent me home with an appointment to see the pdoc. It sucked being there, but I got what I needed from it. The second time, I went to a different hospital. I hadn’t slept in 7 days and desperately needed sleep ai
ds. I checked myself in, and they tried to convince me I was fine and should just go home and drink chamomile tea. I told them if they didn’t shoot my ass full of something that made me sleep a whole night, I would definitely not be safe to go home. I wasn’t suicidal, but I was so desperate for sleep that I was considering taking unsafe amounts of prescription sleep aids. They gave me 5 different sleeping pills over the course of the night (I kept waking up) and a private room with explicit instructions I was not to be disturbed. I managed 6 hours, and then said I felt well enough to go home and talk to my doctor about a new long-term sleep aid. So, in my experience, the hospital really sucks, and the only reason to go there is if you need immediate care that cannot wait until you see your doctor. It is good at its purpose. Its purpose is to tweak your meds and release you to see your doctor once you feel safe enough to wait for your appointment."

I tried invega sustenna first after refusing meds at second admition 7 years ago. At the time i hated psychiatry and pretty much the world . However my dad felt like it didnt work and i was to angry or agitated a couple days after administration. I then went on clopixol. At this point 7 years on i have to say im what u might call addicted, dependemt on it. I even request higher and more frequent doses. The calmness it produces is unbeatable and it doesnt take away my thought processes so i can continue to produce music. Anyway if youre struggling and looking for an alternative to newer lai ask your doctor about Clopixol. It could be right for u."

174397883,"Thank you for your response. It’s because of my memories that I really do struggle. I’ve been abducted by real aliens a lot, sometimes they were fake like in the military or Illuminati or something. I call them Milabs and so do others on the internet. It’s very scary and sometimes I died. I’ve lived countless lives. The longer I live, the more I remember. I was told in a past life I was in a causal loop. That’s what it certainly feels like except reality does change a little bit for me. It’s hard to tell what’s real sometimes. I cannot remember being alive or conscious before 2011. I can feel, notice, and sense, and even see when my mind transfers bodies or goes through space (like _PERSON_ talked about recently). I was told in a past life by the military they don’t care what mental illness I have. I know I’ll never serve, which is fine by me. In a past life, they told me I was a super soldier. It’s some stupid project. I have to follow a script of reality because the person who 
was alive in 2010/2011 wasn’t me but a consciousness copy or something. A different version of me. I had my mind uploaded to a computer over a trillion lifetimes ago. I lose count on how many past lives I’ve had – not that it matters. I heard over 7000 one time. But I hate the mental hospital and I hate going back in time. I’m tired of being seen as a crazy person. I admit I do have real psychiatric issues. If I could work and go to school, I’d be fine. They can and do wipe memories. The aliens did let me join the military in a past life via consciousness transfer and manipulating time. Furthermore, I’m afraid the military will use my brain after I die for experiments or possibly put me in another computer program. I’m 100% confident the military doesn’t run the program, but human looking aliens. This is just a glimpse of what I’ve been through over the years in my head and thinking. I have to strive to get better and heal. Every time I die, I start back again. Similar to source code (movie) 
and edge of tomorrow (movie). Except for me, it is hell or worse sometimes. These two movies are just examples that I have thought about. I think about how the mind moves through time and relate it back to me and maybe they’re doing it to all of us except I have a keen insight into this. I have memories of being teleported and stuff by the computer simulators and stuff popping in and out of existence for example like this were in a video game. Like time was resetting or going back to normal. Very strange stuff I still recall in my past lives. I don’t know what else to say. No one believes me and for good reasons. I don’t want them to. Not anymore. I do have a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia but I’m healing and getting better. My vision was so bad, I was in mental agony 24/7. I’m at peace now and I’m happy. Just trying to work on the motivation part and the hygiene aspect. It would be ignorant to ignore the religious aspect of things and simulation theory. Maybe I’m making a bigger deal about 
it than I thought. Knowledge is important. But I think about Socrates, Copernicus, and Galelio for example. I’ve been tortured before many times in my past lives. I don’t want to repeat that scary and horrific experience. I’ve seen the so called End of the World many times and lived through it. Some call it the New World Order or the Book of Revelations. Hopefully, it will never happen and we can all live happy and in peace or most of us. I would say God is in control but there are malevolent forces like aliens that are among us. I did not hallucinate those crafts in 2016. I’ve seen those in my causal loop thousands or millions of times. I’ve seen green fire in the sky in my backyard. I’ve seen strange looking drones, one that don’t even look real one time. It was following my mom in the car. I’ve seen other things like my mom’s car shifting by itself but it could have been an accident. I got scared."

176216240,"I recently finished some long distance courses, about 2 years worth since 2018. It helped me a lot to get to the lowest dose of medicine I could function on, because then the mind gets less sedated. I experimented finding the right dose, even cutting pills in half to find out. I would confer with your doctor first though. Also supplementing helps a lot. Psych drugs are proven to deplete nutritions from the brain, meaning ideally you need to get more than normal people, even if you eat healthy. So taking extra vitamins, minerals and omega 3’s is a good idea. And just as important you gotta stay activated every day. Go for walks, excersise, do mind puzzles, read a book…anything. Just don’t slip into thinking about thoughts you had when you were psychotic, trying to figure things out, because then you get stuck in a mind game that is impossible to win, because there isn’t really anything to figure out.

176216262,"Intolerance. Everything I want to do on here is against the rules. Not too long ago, I worked with some younger women and every day we would chat over lunch, usually about mental health. I went through all my beliefs with them including beliefs that nobody else would accept at all but they all said I definitely wasn’t ill. They weren’t shocked or offended by anything and believed it. Their only criticism was that they didn’t understand my motivation for wanting change and said I shouldn’t worry. Those women were pretty and think to myself that if I spoke to other good looking women, they would also back me up and say I am not ill. I can’t imagine the reaction I would get if I tried to find such women on here and the subjects to talk about are prohibited. Most of the conversations those women had would be banned on here. I am a member of an internet get together group that has no such rules. I get on well with the leader and he is extremely difficult to shock (he has said shocking things).

176216274,I liked her video. Something to think about. It is just interesting how this one virus can change the world. I see new borders being built inside the EU when each country tries to solve their internal problems caused by this virus. I think this is a test for the whole EU.

176216276,Yeah I don’t like being in the spotlight even at a party
176216277,Well they kill you after you’re dictator first. I just feel like I’m blowing it by not moving away. I had a chance to make things right and I’m blowing it. If I go to hell it’s my fault it seems. I’m trying to do my best but it’s just not good enough.
176216278,"Well she bills Medicare for the phone calls. My psychiatric care provider waives me paying the 20% copay though. They only take original Medicare and Medicaid, so I can’t join an Advantage plan because my psychiatric care is the lion’s share of my health care money. Most Advantage plans charge a $40 copay for psychiatric care. I have several group therapies a week along with one one-on-one therapy session a week."
176216279,"Any of the big ones are good mayoclinic.org or WebMD.com or _USER_ID_.org they all are good sources to give you general information about bipolar disorder and sza. Or you can do a Google search and there’s tons of little clinics that have pages up that are interesting. Basically bipolar is a mood disorder characterized by periods of high (manic) moods, and low (depressed) moods and periods of normal moods. The way this presents varies greatly and there are different types of bipolar disorder. You should spend some time on the above mentioned sights to get a feel for it and see if it sounds like you. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this diagnosis, but it’s better to know so you can get the right medicine, a mood stabilizer, and cap off those mood spikes, so you can get to a place of feeling better. Good luck."
176216280,Maybe you have another health issue other than MS? You should still see a doctor for the wooziness.

174397891,no not right now anymore. The meds made my symptoms go away mostly. Negative symptoms i have though and some cognitive problems.
176216282,"Yeah, I feel that in a big way. After his meltdown he kept apologizing and saying he would understand if we wanted a different kid. I don’t know how to get him to believe that we don’t want a different kid, after he’s been through like twenty homes. I think once the adoption is finalized, he will believe it more."

176216286,"I’m in no rush to get it. I want to see the full safety profile come out, and would also like to see how long the vaccine provides immunity for. I’ve done a good job at social distancing and being masked up, so I’m not afraid to continue moving forward in that way."
176216287,I don’t know anymore am I real or not? My depression is severe and Alien is trying to control me. I’m playing with the knife again. I can’t cope and now I contacted my pdoc and tried to make an appointment and he says I should consider admission to hospital. What??! No! Not again! No! Maybe I just need to up my amisulpride. … I can’t go again… please no…

176216290,I have been an artist since I was a kid. I paint a lot now. I enjoyed printmaking for a long time. I had a few exhibitions at different galleries but it was too much for me. I always hid during the receptions because of all the people and their thoughts
176216291,When I’m overwhelmed I count down from ten in my head as many times as need be. It actually helps!

176216292,"He puts his hands to his face and slowly exhales. I think he thinks im a fker. They dont care yo. Prescribed Amphetamine helps some. Or maybe modafinil, makes u feel like your on a pot of coffee."

176216293,Yes. The universe is freaking massive. We’re not so special as to be the only ones.
176216294,I went from 74 to 80kg since becoming sick. I managed to loose 5kg but gained it all back. I want to get down to 70kg
174397909,"Schizoaffective disorder is a lifelong disorder with normal phases in between the high and low phases. The focus, as far as recovery in sza is concerned, is on process, rather than an end result. I say this because it’s inherently a chronic illness with waxing and waning episodes, inter-spread with periods of absolute lucidity and high functionality. It is very difficult to give a straightforward answer to this question. If by recovery you mean non-recurrence of the episodes, it is almost impossible to give a specific number of years for the duration of remission. I will say this: It all depends on the individual case. Some of deciding variables will be: family history, age of onset, duration of untreated psychosis, number of episodes so far, medical comorbidity, nature of psychopathology (especially mixed nature of episodes), duration of episodes, association of any head injury or cerebral insult, kind of and number of antipsychotics used in the treatment, personality traits (especially stress c
oping strategies and if any borderline traits are present). The variables are so many that deriving any straight forward equation is almost impossible."
176216295,"Oh I had that too, couldn’t sleep at night and when I slept, it woke me up in the middle of the night and couldn’t sleep after for hours. I took Benzatropine but it took 20 min for it to work."
176216296,"SoO0…, Hello Again _AT_MENTION_. Could You Elaborate On Your Thought, As Unusual As It Seems, With The Idea Of Ghosts Living Separately Inside Of The Shell That Keeps Our Bones Intact.

Sz gets better with age and there are some very successful people with sz worldwide. 20 million people have sz and if everyone with sz had degenerative brains we would end up with 20 million people in psych wards. Your nurse has had her training basis in _USER_ID_. YOU build the life you want, not her. We can do great things! We might need support along the way but that doesn’t mean we are worthless or anything like that. ???? everyone who thinks we are worthless. You can do great things, even if that seems minor."

176216303,Klonopin has weak mood stabilizing properties but it does nothing for me except make me feel strange. It’s considered an anticonvulsant.

176216306,I had a good day today. its just I know I’ve been struggling and still am on my good days my nights are hard. just cant afford to check myself in and get help. I have to ride it out and wait to talk to my doctor and hope my medicine relives some of my symptoms.
176216307,Let us know how this folds out and if you and the pregnant lady are okay
176216308,This experience looks horrible.

174397903,Have you tried Doctors best NAC with cofactors? Its useful for negative symptoms.
174397902,"It’s possible I just have severe Bipolar type 2 or type 1, despite never having mania. I might have severe trauma though. Doctors deny this. I have mild Aspergers that never bothered me. I always had very low energy and motivation my entire life. Could be ADHD too. I had to drink energy drinks every day to survive. Now I’m addicted. What can I do if I have severe bipolar? It’s been mentioned a few times. I don’t want to lose my benefits if the doctor says I don’t have schizophrenia. I have no motivation, cannot be consistent, I have no energy, and cannot focus or do tasks at all. I have no mania but some depression. I don’t see things or hear things. I get intrusive thoughts all the time. Possibly worsened by energy drinks, which is probably super bad if one has Bipolar. Most people deny I have bipolar because they say I got really, really bad delusions, and they’re not real. My current doctor is a genius and like doctor house and is more logical and scientific. He says he focuses on 
genetics. That’s why I want ECT. Would clozaril be a huge mistake if I’m Bipolar type 2?"
174397906,Clozapine Vyvanse Valium Gabapentin and viibryd too but i dont take them regularly

176216313,"Yes, I think it’s close to word salad, cos I make new words, I connect words with strange way, and I am talking with no one. I even get furious if the walll objects to me. Of course it doesn’t object or respond, but I imagine it does"
176216314,"What do you mean _AT_MENTION_ I don’t understand your post. No I reread it, I understand, thanks. Yes you could be right."
176216315,"Ya we can make the BEST or the WORST psychiatrists. I think you need to be extremely stable and pretty much recovered though. It’s not just intense, hard, and lots of schooling. You gotta be smart and be able to work your ass off. Money is nice. Real nice. Med school is hard as well as the MCAT. I tend to put myself in the hardest positions. I think business school is a breeze unless you do a PhD or become a quant. Like the GMAT. My former friend scored super high on it. Could have got in to a 10 ten or something but chose not to. Not sure why. I would hate myself if I was an accountant. It’s just bean counting and I would quit. I liked finance a lot – too much, but it’s a prestige thing and I have no reputation – I ruined it. I have to make my own fortune in this world now. Regarding med, I would have done it. But I changed my mind. I think engineering is better for me. I think with my delusions, I would be a terrible medical professional in the psychiatric field. I do have empathy thoug
h. If I had to be a doctor, I would be a surgeon or a general doctor. I would even consider other careers that require less schooling. I think people get stuck on the title or the money or the prestige. I think some psychiatrists make way too much and there is definitely a shortage here. I would do it if things were different. My best bet is to make it big with patents or intellectual property and sell it or make products I guess as a programmer/engineer/inventor. I’m already 31 and expect to die young from cancer or something. I hope most of my money I potentially make goes to my immediate family since I have no kids. I have two nieces, a brother, and a sister. My mom and my father. That’s about it. Time is ticking. I think radiology therapist is cool. They make good money with little amounts of school. I like physics. Same thing with PA. I’m not really a nurse person. But I don’t want to go into the medical field. Same thing with law. I bought some law study books and threw them away. Wasted over a 
hundred dollars. Same thing with my actuary P1 exam book. I tried and tossed it. That book alone was almost 100 dollars. No more study manuals for me!"
176216316,Nice use of colors.
176216317,Ok i’ll try that
176216318,"I think very few people need pet sitters at this time, but maybe once everything dies down you will be able to get a lot of business."
176216319,Also _AT_MENTION_ you seem very smart. I think this disease works harder against really smart people. The hooks and convoluted parts to the delusions are worse. This isn’t to downplay anyone else’s experience. But I think it can be isolating for us.
174397910,"I’ve been waking up at night with stressful dreams since I’ve been taking AP. My dreams have changed since I’m taking Quetiapine and even though I still wake up at night, some nights a few times, I usually get back to sleep easily. With Quetiapine I’ve found myself sleeping until later hours in the morning. Sometimes I associate my poor sleep to bad sleep hygiene: I put my phone asside while still playing videos and get on my pillow without turning off the light, or I think I’ll get up to brush my teeth but I don’t…"
176216320,How high of a dose? Id love to get rid of negatives but I don’t wanna risk psychosis .
176216321,It helped me to know via the psychologist that intrusive thoughts are normal and everyone gets them. You just have to learn the skills to not let the passing thoughts have significance. I am still working on this. My problem is that to me they behave in a similar way to my voices when I am psychotic. They bother me less these days. I used to be completely overwhelmed by them. Since being on Levomepromazine (Nozinan) my head has been a lot clearer and I am able to sleep again
176216322,I’m overweight but thankfully my blood pressure is normal.

All I can suggest is try with all your might to focus on the positive things in your life no matter how small and insignificant they may seem. Do you have a pet? If not, I hope your living arrangements would allow you to get one. Pets are great for lifting our spirits and helping to shoulder some of life’s burdens. I wish I could do something to help."
176216327,It was a long time ago when I had thought broadcasting I cant remember properly but the main thing I remember is just feeling as if they could and believing that they could read my thoughts. I guess sometimes they made gestures too that correlated with what I was thinking
174397924,Probably not as badly as people with schizophrenic stigmatize mental health professionals. For me the worst part about having schizophrenia was finding treatment for it. I had a REALLY bad dr. For about 3 years. Now I drive 1.5 hours for psych needs because my NP is THAT good.

176216343,Living with delusions like the one you posted is torture and may become dangerous or worse sometimes.
176216344,you clearly do not understand what I’m saying
176216346,"Yes, what _AT_MENTION_ stated is very true. On both accounts, cannabis has shown to alter developing brains especially if one smokes during adolescence. Cannabis is also much more potent now, ironically, it is easier to find cannabis with higher THC content than it is to find clean low THC cannabis. Honestly I’d sometimes smoke some old school cannabis from a medical dispensary more often than high THC buds. At 90 dollars an ounce it was easier on the pocket as well. Heh. One time during an episode of psychosis, I was having, I smoked some really high volume THC bud and I started crying thinking about people who were burned during the Holocaust. It was not the best experience."

You’ll have to jump through all of the hoops and see all of the doctors again in BC. Make sure you keep all of your documents/assessments from _NAME_ to expedite the process.

I was having some extreme PTSD symptoms, and he kept asking why and what do you mean by that to everything I said. I told him I didn’t feel safe in my body and he was like what does that mean and why why why. It made me feel more worked up to be honest. I was having trouble finding the words. Finally I told him that I was feeling better and goodnight so he would stop. In hindsight I should have just said his questions were overwhelming for me, but I was paranoid and super scared.

I have heard voices from outside of my head that pop in and say things like “take all your meds” or “cut yourself” I guess those are command hallucinations and I felt compelled to do so. I have heard my name being called from inanimate objects. I have heard music coming from objects. I hear whispers and screams. I hear people outside. I hear a group of toddlers getting excited.

176216464,"I would not bother with Supernatural. It is the same with a lot of horror fiction. It seems to me that there is often an underlying hinted at unpleasantness that manifests itself as “the supernatural.” I think that there was a bit of (if it were actually portrayed it would be really gross) “Wincest” hinted at in Supernatural, which sort of made the titular supernatural phenomena welcome. Similarly perhaps in the “X files” it was that _NAME_ fancied _PERSON_ something rotten but he was into his nerdy files, so her frustration manifested itself as monsters. If I am allowed to mention Gnosticism (which is ostensibly a “knowledge” or philosophy rather than a religion) when _NAME_ says that Jesus told him “three words” that he can’t share for fear of being stoned, and horrifying or “burning” his listeners, do you suppose that it was something like “The devil’s listening” or “Satan’s inside you”? I think that it was something much less supernatural, far more… down 
to earth and familiar, and it was precisely for that reason so nasty he could not bring himself to say it. I am suggesting you may be mistaking ickiness for wickedness, smut for satan. But then, just as reality is argued to be a description by some scientists, that may be the nature of the beast."

What I found helpful is repeatedly telling myself that all of those “experiences” are me trying to delude myself out of reality. Basically escapist tactic, same as alcohol or drugs. Alcohol and drugs are harmful. So is self-delusion. Maybe one can overcome “addiction to delusion” through willpower."

174397971,"https://www.psychcongress.com/article/l-methylfolate-may-offer-benefit-schizophrenia Abstract Rationale: This study aims to examine whether folate/folic acid/methylfolate/folinic acid supplemented to antipsychotics (FA + AP) is beneficial in schizophrenia treatment. Objective: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and _NAME_-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of FA + AP for schizophrenia. Methods: The primary outcome was an improvement in total symptoms. Other outcomes were psychopathology subscales (positive, negative, general, and depressive symptoms), discontinuation due to all-cause and adverse events, and individual adverse events. The _NAME_-analysis evaluated the effect size based on a random-effects model. Results: Although we included ten RCTs with 925 patients in total (seven folic acid RCTs (n = 789), two methylfolate RCTs (n = 96), and one folinic acid RCT (n = 40)) in the systematic review, only seven RCTs were included in the _NAME
_-analysis. Pooled FA + AP treatments were not superior to placebo + AP in the improvement of total (N = 7, n = 340; standardized mean difference (SMD) = - 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 0.41, 0.02, p = 0.08, I2 = 0%), positive, general, or depressive symptoms. Pooled FA + AP treatments were more effective than placebo + AP for negative symptoms (N = 5, n = 281; SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.01, p = 0.04, I2 = 0%). Although pooled FA + AP treatments were associated with a lower incidence of serious adverse events than placebo treatments (N = 4, n = 241; risk ratio = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12-0.82, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%; number needed to harm = not significant), there were no significant differences in other safety outcomes between both treatments. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pooled FA + AP treatment improves negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, this treatment was well tolerated. However, because our results might exhibit a small-study effect, future studies with a larger sample sh
ould be conducted to obtain more robust results."

But I got to thinking and I realized that the “human condition” has been with me my whole life and it didn’t stop when I was hospitalized or living in group homes etc. Hell, inside of psychiatric hospitals and group homes the “human condition” is more evident than it is in the “normal” world. To spend 8 months jammed in a hospital with 60 other people and virtually everyone is suffering is to experience the worst in life. And the best. But it’s tiring now."

174397988,"I’m not sure you need to be too concerned about this issue that EverHopeful brings up - here is what they say in the research paper: As has been reported for cardiovascular and cerebro- vascular diseases, longer treatment duration and/or higher dosages may be warranted. For example, in a clinical trial involving human subjects with type 2 diabetes, improvements in oxidative stress were reported with a dose of sulforaphane of 10 g/day (?225 ?mol) and a duration of 4 weeks, each substantially more than in the present study [80]. This may account for the fact that we only observed suggestive changes in brain metabolites following sulforaphane treatment in the present study. Nevertheless, our short-term dosing strategy was well tolerated, which will further facilitate subsequent sulforaphane protocols in an attempt to link clinical biomarkers with patient-oriented outcomes."

176216664,"Invega gave me mental clarity and energy. The only reason I’m not still on it is because I can’t afford it. I was on Medicaid when I was on it.

174398025,"It shouldn’t be controversial that mental illness is a social and economic burden. It’s one of the leading causes of disability, and the treatment costs are staggering, but dwarfed in comparison to the lost incomes. It also places a large burden on families and loved ones. I get that you don’t want to be called a burden, but a disease is always a burden and it won’t help anyone to pretend otherwise (especially not us)."

You sat with me on Discord for as long as I needed it, despite us both knowing your mum would slay you if she found out, and you kept telling me I was loved and I was going to be okay, and let me cry.

176216704,Sometimes I am paranoid of my friends and think that they’re laughing at me behind my back bcz I am in bed all day everyday. How can I verify that its true? Sometimes my paranoia and doubt makes me get argumentative and angry with them for no reason. I made fun of two friends because I knew more about computers than them. I just think that everyone should think like I think. How do I change that?

176216712,I think it is the loss of grey matter that makes us cognitively impaired /dumb. Meds are there to protect the brain from shrinkage and psychosis. So for me it is the illness that makes us dumb and not the meds.

I guess I don’t have a good explanation for why I am depressed. My doctor is going to add a new anti-depressant drug for me next week. It is still important to accept my schizophrenia, but that is not really the reason for my depression."

174398032,"I understand that you are trying to prove a point with your examples. But statistically speaking the average of a population sample in a normal distribution with 1 or 2 standard deviations will represent the majority or 95% and not the outliers which would represent the 5%. So your saber tooth tiger & elephant example may have some validity; however, the majority maybe those saber tooth tigers with average fangs and or elephants whom are average sizes will survive the times. Schizophrenics are known to be the poorest people of society that require government benefits to survive. Schizophrenia is a disease, a mental aberration, an illness that makes people unwell or sick and the fittest people or those that do not get sick. The majority of schizophrenics do not reproduce and survive. Some schizophrenics die at an earlier age."
176216718,"“Useful” means goal-oriented. You set a goal and work toward reaching it. Everyone can have a different opinion of what is or isn’t useful, depending on their personal goals. But most people would agree that: exercise is useful, unless you are bedridden, because it keeps you healthy and gives you energy for other activities personal hygiene is useful because it improves your self-esteem and also others won’t avoid you due to foul smells anything that earns you money (except illegal activities) is useful, and if you can find a lucrative hobby that’s even better"

Yeah I like my era more because punk was just as revolutionary and there’s other stuff out there but it’s solid work that they did. Except _PERSON_. Everyone else’s solo stuff was good as well and there’s some classics in that. So. It’s nice to have an appreciation for the beatles even if your into punk rock.

176216730,"We don’t allow religious discussions on this site. This for a couple of reasons. First, it tends to cause arguments, because for some reason people can’t seem to just respect each other’s different religious beliefs. Second, many folks suffer from religious delusions. It is one of the top three topics of delusion, alongside aliens and government conspiracies. We don’t allow discussions on those topics, either. Third, there are many members here who were subjected to exorcisms by family members who, sadly, did not understand their illness. Those memories can be very traumatic for those individuals, and they don’t need to be reminded of them. I hope you can understand, and help keep this a safe place for everyone.

176216738,"Then yeah, the CBT therapy can help a ton. It teaches you to focus your energy elsewhere when the thoughts come, and just let them pass through your mind without focusing on them. It is important to realize that every single person has weird thoughts from time to time. They can be alarmingly violent or disgusting, and they pop up as a glitch in the way our brains process information. Most people just ignore the thoughts, and don’t worry or talk about them. A few people get stuck on the thoughts. The thoughts distress them. Because they are distressed, the brain thinks “Oh this thought must be important, better keep thinking it.” And then it brings the thought up more often, and doesn’t let it drift away like the thousands of other thoughts. CBT teaches you to let the alarming thoughts drift away and focus on things that make you happy."

Now the voice is saying “you wernt suppose to tell anyone you idiot!” These are the types of ‘revelation knowledges’ i get I know its a hallucination. What used to get me in trouble is id believe i have special access to hidden knowledge. Then id end up on some special mission.

He’s a loner and should be that way and quit his medication. He acts superior and is egotistical. The world does not revolve around him. On the other hand, the rest of my family is very nice and encouraging. My dad frankly said I would end up being homeless someday. He was harsh.

176216829,I’m not sure what is weaker? We are all different. All’s I know is I’m big on function. If I’m not doing well I tried other meds. Sometimes that worked and sometimes that failed miserably but I don’t really regret the process. I think if your stagnating then it’s worth a shot. You can pay a price coming back to meds but if you understand the risks then that is better. I’m just confused by weaker / stronger ap’s. Honestly I think they are all pretty serious chemicals and how you react to each is different to everyone else…At least in my experience.

I get them silent but perceived all the same. They are inside my head. So I wonder if it still classifies as voices. But they aren’t me How is it with yours?

176216845,"This is what I am talking about. Being loved should not make you feel indebted. She needs to remember that in a relationship, she is a partner, not a mom. By doing all of those things, she helped create a power imbalance in your relationship where she was the responsible caretaker, and you were the helpless needy one. She is just as much to blame for your dynamic as you are. She can work on setting healthy boundaries and trusting you to take care of yourself. You can work on seeing that you are worthy of being loved in a healthy way. You can both establish certain boundaries. I used to get caught in this relationship dynamic a whole bunch. With my current partner, he refused, right off the bat. I remember when we were first dating, and I had an atrocious day. I just wanted him to come over and snuggle me. But he said he couldn’t, because he had work in the morning and my house was a 40 minute drive to his work. So he talked with me until 8 pm, then hung up to get sleep. I was so hurt and confused 
at first, because he didn’t immediately drop everything to comfort me. But my friend said “That is a good thing. That means he understands how to set healthy boundaries. That means he will respect your boundaries when you have some.” And he did. I was very wary of the relationship at first, because I had never been in a relationship with healthy boundaries built on trust and respect. It can feel VERY strange and counter-intuitive to the way you are used to showing love. But having your own friends, your own lives, your own separate stuff, is super healthy and important."

176216850,"Consider looking into informed consent for antipsychotics. Different psychiatrists have different views on it. Some will take an authoritarian view on it and some will be responsive to the wishes of the patient. For me informed consent involves trying a drug, seeing how I feel on it and what side effects I’m getting and then determining if the benefits out way the side effects. A lot of psychiatrists will refuse to allow patients to refuse a medication because they hate the way it makes them feel. In Australia you can be forced by the law to receive regular injections, whether it’s a good thing or not. It seems it doesn’t matter if you get Tardive Dyskinesia, sleep all the time, experience no pleasure, get morbidly obese and have your life span reduced by 20yrs so long as you stop talking about the aliens. I have been lucky to get a new psychiatrist who works ‘with’ me instead of the old one who insisted only he knew what was right for me. I’ve found experimenting with AP’s till you f
ind the best one is the way to go. It’s impossible to know a-priori what side effects you’ll get and whether it will be effective or not. Check out Tardive Dyskinesia and life expectancy for people on AP’s Feel free to msg me. Good luck with your studies."

176216855,"I made it to church and it went mostly fine. There were a lot of people my age and it wasn’t crowded and there were friendly people just like I expected. I did make an error at the end of the service. The pastor had everybody stand up in a big circle and hold hands. That was fine and she said some words about how great holding hands is. She had me sold on it but I was holding hands with this women and she glanced at me so we went behind a pew and did it like rabbits for five minutes. No, no, no, that was all in my head, lol. Actually all she did was just give me a friendly glance so I told her, “Yeah, we do this in AA all the time.” WTF? Why did I say that? Why didn’t I just keep my mouth shut? IDK. It’s not something you want to say to a stranger on your first visit to a new church. I realized my faux pau immediately. She was a little taken aback but to her credit she tried to smile and act like it was no big deal but I wondered what she really thought. And later after the service was ov

Since I don’t have bipolar or mania or even hypomania, I just have schizo-affective disorder – depressive type, I experiment on myself. I used to experience zero pleasure and not feel anything.

176216865,"I know I went through a process of realizing that I was going to be on meds for a very long time, and that has nothing to do with the perceived inferiority of people who do take them. Being scared of the meds is like an effed up right of passage for first episode psychosis. It doesn’t seem like it, but the meds do help. It seems scary and weird to take meds for a condition that you’re not even 100 percent sure you have, but if you give it time then the meds will give you clarity and insight you won’t have without them. I can see that you are already a lot more accepting of your situation and that somethings not quite right which is huge. Hang in there and give it time. Things will make more sense if you stick with it! You’re going through a life changing experience, so do be kind to yourself."
176216866,I asked the psychiatrists why we take antipsychotics and was told it was to reduce harm to yourself and the risk of harming others but what about the harm and death caused by antipsychotics? Aren’t antipsychotic causing more death and harm than a person having psychosis? Is there any evidence or some kind of statistics that shows how much harm or even death to other persons while psychotic vs antipsychotics? I have a feeling that antipsychotics cause a lot more harm and death than any amount of schizophrenics ever did…

176216871,They’re not mutually exclusive. In the context of a court of law it is of upmost importance that the witnesses are honest. Above and beyond anything else (whether they’re being paid is one example). Witnesses who are paid are expert witnesses. They are more likely to tell the truth (in my opinion) than someone who is not being paid - because they are a professional and it is their job. And if they are dishonest then their repuation (and chance of future work - thus their very survival) is on the line.

176216889,"This reply may seem off topic, but bear with me: Chordy, plants do indeed have responses to people, and even our thoughts(or maybe it’s just intent). People who study and interpret plant responses have noted that when someone comes to prune branches, the plants are not stressed, but when someone comes with destructive intent(even cutting the same branch a pruner planned on cutting)the plant is stressed. Because of this study that was done on plants I tend to believe that plants, and even animals, are “ok” when we consume them to live. Of course, we ought not be cruel in the taking of any life, but I think when we go into it with gratitude and thankfulness it is “ok.” I love animals and I, too, had a lot of conflict in the past about consuming creatures I considered “friends.” But I came to terms with it due to my attitude of gratitude(as 12 steppers say)and also the knowledge that if we did not eat animals they would overpopulate and starve to death. For instance, deer hunters(limited 
in number by states)keep deer populations to a manageable level. If deer herds are allowed to grow in number their available food supply, especially in winter, would diminish and many animals(not just deer)would die an agonizing death by starvation. A very ugly prospect. Chordy, I’m kinda new, but you seem like a nice person, very caring and considerate. I wish I knew you in 3D life. We could go to McDonald’s or something. Nutcase"

176216900,I view it like a bucket of muddy water. When you are in psychosis it is constantly being shaken up and you can’t see through it. With APs after some years of stability the mud settles to the bottom and the water becomes transparent. Nothing wrong with having an empty head.

First, its either morning or evening, I have to make a meal so I can take “my” pills, 'cause they are only effective, with food. So, that means I have to pull back the covers, Move my body so my feet are on the floor, Stand up, walk toward the kitchen. The desk is in the way, The Desk Chair, The guitar amplifier, My Dresser, Then the ??????? door from my room. The ever increasing number of cats and dogs, Old People, Kids and House Hold Pets, are right there at the door, with all of their lusts, wants, needs, and rituals. Chairs not pushed back in, Used Napkins and left over things, Unwashed dishes, the Debris of Behavioral Therapy and root canals. I get to the refrigerator, which is full of condiments, left overs for a meal for one, and the Last Super. Nothing ready to make, I search the Pantry, Only finding a Canned Laughter, Ready Maid Meals for the Microwave, at the end of 
a Parental Occupation, As a consumer and debt slave, raising Cain or Able, Both disabled, depending on your preference for, blood or vegetables. Father’s Kitchen, Mothers Tomb. Re-organizing the Dishes and the Cutlery, For maximum capacity, of soiled Plates, Utensils, and Drug Dispensers, For the Venerable Dish Washer Appliance, that leaks. Settling on a frozen burrito, From the Ice Cold Tundra, of the Freezer. Both made in a factory, right next door to a pharmaceutical company, taking advantage of tax haven status, in Cork, Ireland. I put a slice of sharp cheddar mouse cheese, and some hot sauce from New York City, on the Burrito that looks like a faerie diaper at this point. Nuke for 1:30 Minutes, A lot longer than Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Take the steaming Faerie Diaper from the Incubator, Return to My Room, Avoiding all Obstacles along the way. Eat it. Take My Pills. Look for something other than ???? on TV and the Internet. Go Back To Sleep. Dream the Impossible Dream and Nightmare. A very well trained

176216965,"_AT_MENTION_ what you’re saying is completely valid. That’s why I asked, am I simply seeking praise from outside sources, something that I have absolutely no control over. I am reading a book written by one of the Greek stoic philosophers in the first century, Epictetus. Again and a gain, he points out the importance of not relying on outside sources for your own happiness. These are beyond our influence, and only the choice to be genuine in oneself can bring happiness I have never pushed anyone for comment, I simply share it. Even though I may be vexed by it at times, I never voice that to people. This Thread is the exception, I’m just looking for guidance"

They said my consumption of alcohol would mess with the results of the examination. You can’t get a proper treatment if you are honest about how much you drink. It’s a bigger _USER_ID_ than mental illness. Mostly doctor don’t care if you are SZ. But if you drink!!! But now im done with drinking, so now i can get an examination if i get grand mal again (no).

176216977,Medications help ease the pain. What meds are you on? It’s not good to live in fear…It really isn’t. I faced ASIO…The Australian version of the CIA. Well I thought I did. Medications really sorted that out… If you on them it’s time for a change/adjustment. You can get better and it’s all about function. You struggle thinking these things all the time your not living as good as you can…We can’t do this alone and sometimes it is ok to ask for help. Please. Talk to your shrink or get one.

176216979,I struggle with similar tactiles. It helps me to focus on a different sensation. Such as holding an ice cube. I also sometimes put lotion on my hands and arms and focus on the feeling. Or you can hold something and focus on its texture.

At least i’m out, When i was most depressed i read a lot of your threads, It helped me a bit knowing life continued out there. Thanks."

176217089,"I know it’s a delusion, but just wondering what your experience of thought broadcast is. Personally, it feels to me like certain people can hear everything I say and feel everything I can think. They usually communicate with me with one or two word phrases, or can imply certain things with smells. They comment on what I do, say and think. I never have any visual hallucinations. I can’t see other people’s thoughts, actions or hear what they say on a daily basis. makes it feel like I’m the centre of the universe, something I hate. You would think if there was a worldwide network of voices you would hear like a crowd talking in all languages all at once, it’s kind of a mystery to me how it works. _PERSON_ know what you experience of thought broadcast is?"

I wonder if before meds I felt feelings that much stronger and it wasnt normal to feel things like that and thats why I notice a difference. It’s either that or the antipsychotics block that part of the brain… Its sad to not get these moments back, however, my quality of life off invega has improved quite significantly.

Honestly I do better than most but stress is my biggest problem. Stress simply makes my paranoia worse. That is hard to deal with but no easy answers. Just do the meds and work with your doc for better function.

174398160,You were on 5mg abilify. It’s just an antidepressant at that dose. 2.5mg is just a placebo with side effects. It takes 2 weeks for abilify to reach a steady state in your body after a change. So my prediction is in 2 weeks you’ll start to feel more depressed.
174398164,Yeah abilify has helped me with this so had zoloft.

Shortly after this incident, she was discharged to a state hospital for longer term care. I think about her often.

I switched to a different doctor after I moved and he said that the other doctor may as well have put me on haldol ( a med I regret) and put me on a really really low dose of risperidone and it didn’t work I was paranoid delusional hallucinating and I was self harming.

176217214,"I used to have religious delusions. I got them mostly under control with medicine and therapy. Now I’m down to three voices/hallucinations. Inmate, he’s my friend and is always commentating about my situation/surroundings. Her, she looks like _NAME_ and always is making remarks about my appearance. And then another, he’s just pure evil, sometimes I hear him, sometimes I catch a glimpse of him and sometimes I can feel his presence. Its very unsettling. I’m starting therapy again on Monday and hope to calm those voices too."

176217219,You don’t have to believe in it. A lot of people in my Hispanic community claimed to curse someone but the victim is completely oblivious and lives a happy life as if nothing ever happened.
176217220,I would guess because those names are insecurities you have. One theory of voices is that they are thoughts that accidentally get processed in the auditory processing center of our brains instead of the area designated for thoughts. Distressing thoughts are more likely to come back again and again because your brain deems them important due to the amount of emotional response you have to them.
176217221,You’re in denial that you aren’t sick. Thinking your Nurse has poisoned you is delusional.

So I am afraid that I’m being tracked by former friends, or enemies, and giving them a free show, in the best case scenario. I must anonymize, to shake off this perception I have of the outer world. Just the perception of it is too much. But I think I’ve compromised myself. _AT_MENTION_, _AT_MENTION_, I’ll promise to consider highly, working my way back to the forum in a way that feels better… and I’ll use more discretion, to filter away the ‘bad apples’ of my real world If it’s real. I’m cynical … and it’s inexplicable to me that I had this blind spot going…"

176217248,"I’d say that my experience is similar. I’m withdrawn, and it is hard for me to meld with the general conversation. I can keep myself entertained pretty well through rumination and daydreaming. I’ve gotten to where I prefer the company of my fantasies over the reality of conversation and socializing. I’m not really worried about it, though. I’ve been this way for 45 years. I like it."

But, since I don’t have a plan, they won’t admit me. And, honestly, I don’t want to be inpatient right now because I don’t think it would help since most of my problem is physical pain making my sz get worse. I’m just having trouble. Every night I cry. Every day I daydream about ending it all. I’ve tried reaching out to friends, but I don’t think they really care. Like, I straight up told them I was suicidal last week and I haven’t heard from any of them since then. What else can I do?

They expose you to a tiny amount of the virus in order to see how it replicates/genetic test to provide insight on how your genetics/biology respond to the virus to prepare the population for a universal vaccine with contact tracing via smartphone tech. like abilify mycite which is already FDA approved.

176217300,I used Lion’s Mane extract from RealMushrooms on Amazon. It affected my extreme anxiety pretty quickly.
176217301,I don’t think so. I had lots of friends. Have alienated them all though. Don’t like to explain being sick. I can relate to a Beautiful Mind now. The first time I saw it I hadn’t hallucinated yet. My doctor told me to watch it. I didn’t know what schizophrenia was. He recommended it. I thought he was crazy. I told him I didn’t have imaginary friends. Fast forward 4 years and now I hallucinate and talk with them just like he did in the movie. I am told that he didn’t really see people though and that was Hollywood. But that’s just how I hallucinate. I figured it out when a girl came and talked to me and entered the room through a wall and a chair. No telling how many times it happened before then. If I see strangers in my house I know I am hallucinating. Out in the world I would have no idea. They look and sound real.
176217302,"I can’t seem to do this. My CPN just try to downplay things all the time because he treats me like a baby thinking that he can brush off everything and not take any action.

My psychiatrist seems nice but he doesn’t have the time to go into much detail.

176217334,"Thank you all for your replies. I did not realize the implications of just sitting, in particular the need also to do things and be active. For me sitting was a relief of nervous feelings and it was a lot better than lying down and sleeping for a few hours. I just have too much time. Some of you commented that it would be unhealthy to think too much. This is true. But sometimes I sit peacefully and think kind of slowly. pr21 commented that sitting can be like a blank mind. When this happens to me I then decide to do something else, like reading. _PERSON_ was agreeing with me about sitting and perhaps reading, to spend long stretches of time. Leaf talked about visualizing the good feeling of an activity and using that to motivate one’s self. Anyway I guess sitting and thinking is not the panacea for my boredom."
176217335,"Your meds made you stop believing your delusions. Sometimes it takes a little time for the AP to work, which may have happened to you. But you believed certain things and told us that. Then you got a shot. Not long after, you were no longer delusional. So your meds are helping even though they’re not helping enough to stop your paranoia. You need meds. Plain and simple. Listen to your pdoc and take what you’re prescribed. And let your pdoc know you’re still paranoid."

She suffered and had tough times.sorry to start writing about this that has nothing to do with the question. My apologies!
176217371,Having not worked for a while I have watched the working members of the family celebrate having nothing to do. Ironically just like when I had nothing to do some of them had lofty goals. The most realistic from my recollection was one of my brothers who said “I have a lot of things I’d like to do but I’ll probably sit on my recliner and eat cheetos.” That’s what I ended up doing eventually.

Like having an imaginary friend that i never told anyone about. I havent seen him since i went on medication though. My voices used to be more helpful and give me some different perspectives on things. Now they have changed quite a bit since my psychotic break. Theyre kinda mean and judgemental now. They also tell me i should die pretty often so that i can free people from their misgivings or something, some crappy martyr delusion ive developed lol. I miss that cat though, i used to think he was my spirit animal/imaginary friend and being native american, i thought i was blessed/gifted.

I am concerned because it has been very very hot out lately, like 100 degrees and its probably been in my car a long time, weeks or more.

I would have a personal trainer to help me workout and keep me motivated. I would get massages for my neck everyday so I could get rid of these headaches. I would make sure my kids had nice houses close by so I could see them often. I would take care of my ex and my sister’s expenses too and send a bunch of money to my brothers. I would make sure my Aunties had everything they needed and wanted. I would donate money to animal charities for the care of homeless animals.

176217422,I got hit with a severe depression after my second psychosis after I stabilized and came back down to reality. I had a tough month dealing with it but eventually started taking Wellbutrin to take care of it. I started with 200mg and eventually now I take 50mg. It has helped me a lot with my mood and motivation and on top of that I haven’t gained any weight. The depression seems to be going away and I hope I can get off the AD completely. The less medication the better. Hopefully it works for you as well as it has for me.

174398208,"I was initially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. I was put on Abilify 20 mgs. I gave the doctor my symptoms and told him I thought I had ADD. The problem was that the paranoia was there since eight years earlier. But, these delusions were something the PDoc didn’t know about. I didn’t know they were delusions because they were true to me. I was diagnosed when I went out for three nights without sleep, and did some stupid things. Thus, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Now almost 10 years since my first diagnosis, it has been realized that the roots of the illness (SZA) are in early childhood. Now apart from the concentration problems, I had another symptom: A sound filtering problem since childhood. So, at that time, I was giving him my symptoms, which included the above symptom. Eventually, he gave me a medication for focus, Ritalin. For years after that, I had esoteric experiences. I was put on Clozapine, and the esoteric experiences continued. When Abilify was mixed with Clozapine, the 
esoteric experiences abated. This was Eight years after the initial diagnosis. Once he had switched me to Ritalin, and I had ended up in the hospital, that _PERSON_ said he doesn’t specialize in this condition and doesn’t want to treat me anymore. His research work was in Bipolar/Schizophrenia I believe. Whenever I tell a Psychiatrist that I was given Ritalin for focus, they don’t understand how Ritalin could be given to someone with Psychosis without due diligence. At that time, my family had provided some symptoms, based on which that doctor had concluded that I was in Psychotic Depression. In other words he didn’t think I was in Mania because of Abilify, but because I was Bipolar, it must be Psychotic Depression. Yet, he gave me Ritalin, though I asked for it because I thought I had ADD. My Columbia University GPA was 3.5 so the doctor just couldn’t understand how this was possible. The symptoms I had, and the fact that they were present since childhood, was what baffled him. He seemed more conce
rned about that and kept on asking me my GPA. Is this a criterion to judge whether there is Bipolar or Schizoaffective? He just had to make sense of the symptoms. Would this be considered Malpractice?"

176217439,What country do you live in? I live in usa in california and theres a serial killer in my town right now that the police are looking for. And i hear the voices accuse me of them to.

If your like me then i think i can help you. No drugs no people no drs. Its really simple and easy well i guess that depends on where you live. But you cant do it if you hang yourself. If you hang yourself then they win. And it wont prove anything but will only add to the _USER_ID_. Let me know when your ready and ill tell you what to do.
176217440,"I didn’t have much luck with Latuda. Vraylar caused my leg to swell up, so I wasn’t in it King enough to see if it would work or not.

If it does, why would you want to stop that from happening? You deserve an AP that does that for you, right? Think about this… how many times have you read threads with posts from the MI saying they feel so much like a normie that they never needed to be treated? Or, some think they are cured. Now, LED, I’m going to care about you and support you as much as I can, but think about your family for a sec. If you won’t do it for you, do it for them. I’m so sorry that this sounds judgmental.

He said that the information they requested and I provided to them as prep for how I am now was enough for them and didn’t need discussion which I thought was weird.

176217474,As far as I know I’ve never even been flagged. I would feel just awful if I hurt anybody. But I guess if it happens it would be a learning experience.
176217475,"Yes, it’s nice, but now I feel lonely. Does it make sense?"
176217476,_PERSON_ just wondering is there another forum somewhere that one can discuss this stuff?
176217477,yes I’m highly functional on Geodon.

175159829,The news really used to trigger me. It was real bad when _PERSON_ was President. That’s when I got sick though. In 2008. It got better when _PERSON_ was in office. I have been watching a little news now for a while. My wife keeps Fox News on all night long but she kept the volume down for me so I have always been a little exposed. I am admittedly a Republican so I thought that might have had something to do with it. But now that _PERSON_ is in office I can still tolerate the news. Let’s not make this political though. It was all the crazy stuff going on in the world that used to trigger me but I don’t seem to get triggered anymore watching the news. I guess I have gotten better. But don’t get me wrong. If some guy shoots up another video game tournament I am turning the news off again. I think because of COVID and no large public gatherings anymore these types of things aren’t happening right now. Still so many people dying though. It’s still depressing seeing all the numbers from COVID 
deaths. Some guy shot up a WalMart in El Paso though not long ago so I guess it’s not totally safe. I used to live in El Paso so that hit close to home. I still own a home there. Does the news trigger you or did it ever? It took me years to get over that.
176217479,I would at least get a blood test done _AT_MENTION_ Don’t procrastinate!
176217480,"You should publish a collected poems edition. No joke, I really like your stuff. Thanks for posting."

176217488,"Be psychotic, as long as you can function properly. No harm in that."
176217489,"i feel refreshed when i wake up in the morning, luckily… can’t say i feel bad when i get up. When i have to get up earlier (really rare) then i feel not so refreshed…"
176217490,"That’s pretty sexist, _AT_MENTION_ and not something I’d expect from you. People can be attractive and professional."
176217491,I am currently on the max dose of Wellbutrin and I don’t know if it’s me or if the medication just isn’t what I need. I have some good days but I have some really bad days and just can’t quite figure out why. I want to know how well your antidepressants work and if you still get depressed or if they pretty much get your mental state out of the dumps. I just don’t know how much of a difference antidepressants make when one is on antipsychotics. I know nobody here is an expert on this but maybe someone has experience.
176217492,"One of my first “delusions” (coincidences) was associated with TV. It was 22.09.2014. One was associated with teletext of first programme of Polish national television. On page 117 I read about two Austrians which received commendation crosses thanks to taking care about cementeries in certain city where I was and one of persons from Polish _PERSON_’s syndrome (AS) forum studied. Two individuals which were men and were among “proto-aucorigians” had logins associated with surnames of two Austrian doctors who described autistic disorders about 1940 (Leo _PERSON_ and _NAME_). Three days earlier I made photos of Jewish cementery and one on which part of Catholic cementery with crosses was present, that day (19.09.2014) about 11 p.m. I watched photos of Jewish and Catholic cementeries made by another person which had diagnosis of AS and was considered “proto-aucorigic” by me. 22.09.2014 I found name and surname of another “proto-aucorigic” (PACR) individual and heard about an accident 
in which a woman who wrote certain sorts of books died. Two PACR male individuals read books of that kind in childhood. Number of letters in the name of the woman who died had the same number of letters and the same last two letters as name of one of two PACR females (and four first letters of her surname were the same as first four letters of surname of that female, one of male PACR individuals had also the same four letters at the beginning of his surname). When that coincidence happened, I was really excited and had loud stereotyped behaviors."

176217496,"I read that precocious diagnose is good. A good social development at the time the illness appears is good too. If the person didn’t developte good social skills at the time she got ill, either 20 or 30, the prognosis is worse"

176217502,"So far at most it has caused a few helicopters to fly around. I mean I could see why. I tried to go to a less populated area but hell anyone hooting and hollering would get negative attention as it is. I didn’t shoot and holler but I could see maybe someone freaking out and calling the police. Also maybe I should have checked the 10 day local weather forecast. On a slightly interesting side note winds facing Southwest seem to be at 10 miles per hour in a few days. That kinda goes along with my delusion in that it causes a bit of a I dunno suction effect that then is refilled I guess like a vacuum? Also the way I explained it to my dad was that, it is like a drop on a cup that is filled to the rim and causes it to overflow. I think that is a good analogy. I did tell him it would help get rid of my delusion. Here’s hoping it does."

So I don’t know how it’s affected our budget. We only have five years to save up, and I know for sure he won’t qualify for financial aid once he’s adopted, so the pressure is on. Gotta hold out hope for lots of scholarships, I guess. I’ve grown used to having lots of wiggle room in our budget, but kids change things, financially.

176217521,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you were abused. I think writing about the violence is part of the healing process, but maybe another step would be to focus on how you felt when you were being abused. Maybe go to a room that you find comforting, and feel those feelings (of course you can stop at any time if it becomes too uncomfortable). If you feel sad, cry. If you feel anxious, take deep breaths. If you feel angry, punch a pillow. Write all of your feelings on a piece of paper. Then (safely) burn it."

But, after this, I felt better. I took all the other medications with no success and really wanted Abilify to work. It works now and makes me sleepy. I am working online and supporting myself too. I am doing ok. I have been off medications seven times and each time I have been hospitalized afterwards. I must remain compliant and have for over three years now. I have not been in a hospital during this time. I like Abilify now but at times hear voices occasionally. During these times, I continue my medication and the voices disappear in a week or two. So, nothing is ideal. I would try to find a medication that works best for you. I like Abilify but know that it may not work in others. Best wishes!!"

If you’re not on an ap yet I’d recommend going on one ASAP because the sooner you go on one the easier it is to treat. Thought broadcasting tends to feel absolutely real but it isn’t. Don’t worry yours is not real either. Even if it feels that way.

Then I would see the shadow in the reflection of my full length mirror and I would turn to look and it wouldn’t be there. It was horrifying. It made me panic and paranoid and not able to close my eyes for a long time. I’m hoping the Loxapine I got today takes care of this today. I can’t take another night like this.

If you are just at home all the time and not burning too much, that should be enough calories. If you’re having a volunteer day, I would go to 1200 to give you enough energy.

When we look at history we see that power was much more concentrated in the top before democracy. There were kings and noblemen and the church running the world, and this was the way the world was supposed to be back then, because people didn’t know of any alternative. The idea that the commoners one day would have a say was quite foreign. Caucasians were also slaves to their kings, noblemen and the church, paying taxes, but having no say whatsoever. I am sure that in a couple of hundred years if humanity still prevails they will look back at this time and have their laughs and disgust about some of the ways we ran the world just like we think about the people who came before us. Point being, it is easy to judge people when a new and more righteous knowledge has been aquired through the test of time."

176217635,"So I finally started thinking what if I don’t have overactive bladder at all, what if this is some sort of compulsive behavior. Let me explain. I have been through the full range of health tests, blood work, etc. All comes back clean and normal. (My urine does tend to test positive for group beta strep bacteria but it is a common bacteria found on genitals and to be safe I had been on antibiotics to try to treat it multiple times and it never changed anything) During the night is when it is most prevalent. It starts before I go to bed. I HAVE to pee before going to bed for the night. Then I get up, but feel like my bladder isn’t fully empty (yes they have run tests to make sure I empty my bladder all the way when I pee and I do). So almost immediately after coming back to bed I turn around and go back to the bathroom. Sometimes I even just stand up from the toilet and sit right back down. So I can’t sleep unless I’ve peed at least twice, even if the second time is just a few drops. Note tha
t i only get this urge to have my bladder be COMPLETELY empty at night time. (Before getting on seroquel I could have the urge to return to the bathroom to “fully empty” my bladder numerous times, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 times before I could sleep it was exhausting and like torture) Then I need to sleep with two pillows between my legs. I didn’t used to need to sleep with any pillows between my legs, I started with one because my boyfriend did it and then suddenly could no longer sleep without a pillow, if I did it felt like I had to pee worse. Then one pillow wasn’t enough I needed two. If anything interrupts this bedtime ritual, for example I pee twice, go back to bed, and my boyfriend wants to show me an internet post. Even if what he is showing me takes 10 seconds. I now HAVE to pee again. I cannot do anything before falling asleep or I have to pee again. It used to be bad enough to where every single time I woke up at night I would HAVE to pee. But seroquel changed that so now I no longer fee
l that urge and can just go back to sleep when I wake up. During the day things are far more improved and it seems when things are keeping me distracted and busy I really pee a normal amount. If things are stressful, I need to pee more. Also if there is nothing to keep me distracted I need to pee more. So for example my job is stressful, so I am constantly running to bathroom having to pee. On my days off, when I’m doing nothing but relaxing, I am always running off to pee. But if say I go out to dinner, I am relaxed but also distracted, and I can go an entire 3 hour, 4 hour outing before needing to pee. I googled this and a ton of results for OCD and compulsive peeing popped up. Apparently it is actually quite common. I have been told before by psych professionals that I had some “OCD-like” behaviors but not to the point where they would diagnose me with it. I am just wondering if there is more to this than just OAB, especially considering none of the OAB meds worked for me. summary: I think my bladder 
problem may be psychological rather than physiological. I’m going to bring it up in therapy and see if I can figure something out."

176217637,"https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-computational-universe Food for thought. Random thoughts: If we live in a quantum computer, then it seems bell’s inequality is wrong. I have a random, vague (possibly wrong) thought that we showed Bell’s Inequality was wrong (had an error) in a past life (parallel universe/worldline). Not me, but real physicists and scientists. I just remember the news, vaguely. Thus, this would help show or provide evidence, that we could be living in a computer simulation and program. I know for a fact we do because it was on the news in one of my lives. The same laws of physics and similar events as this universe. In fact, I think it’s a lost or forgotten fact. (for the record, I don’t fully or nearly understand Bell’s Inequality/Bell’s Theorems as I should, not just because it’s advanced, but because I have limited intelligence). I’m just going based off this article. It says that Bell’s Inequality is rooted in the concept/belief of randomness. I d
on’t believe in true randomness, but determinism. I believe and we figured out Many Worlds Theory of Quantum Mechanics is correct. But I would listen to _NAME_, and not me.

But errr an illegal drug that is getting attention for ptsd and depression treatment… Truly remarkable transforming life changing experiences. I think louiseg was thinking of getting the ketamine treatment. Errr it’s the best thing I’ve ever done since I figured out how to consume it without getting me sick anymore. My ptsd feels ZAPPED tbh. And honestly I never realized how bad my ptsd was until it’s gone for now at least… Although I’m pretty manic today.

This warrants further study so that they can provide additional guidance to those with a history of severe allergic reactions. With that said, folks who do not have a history of severe allergic reactions should be OK getting the vaccine."

176217726,"So the assumption, apparently when people first start experiencing non ordinary perceptions and experiences, especially when young, is that dynamic a threat? So, that means that ignorance of things, immediately requires a whole host of defensive posturing and self preservation measures, to ensure what… ignorance and alienation? It goes both ways. Supposedly, the person first time experiencing non ordinary perceptions and experiences is threatened by those experiences and perceptions because of having not experienced or perceived it before, and vice versa (eventually) the things we percieve and experience become more threatening. Seems like a stupid process of denial to me. Additionally, a remarkable reaction occurs with lots of people, they start interpreting their experiences and perceptions based upon previous programing or simple bias. That seems lame to me too."

Compensation can cover up either real or imagined deficiencies and personal or physical inferiority. Positive compensations may help one to overcome one's difficulties.

176217848,Great to hear _NAME_! That was good motivation.
176217849,I am constantly amazed at the quality of writing in my humanities online classes by my fellow classmates. Most humanities classes at this college have discussions once or twice a week where everybody is supposed to write 200-300 mini-essays on a topic and we all can see each others submissions. At first I was totally intimated at how intelligent classmates sounded. I didn’t think mine would compare and be good enough. But once I got going I learned quickly that my papers were just as good and I got the grades to show for it. Then my next realization a few years ago is that in a lot of cases their papers looked intelligent but looking closer in a lot of cases they had a few good lines and some big words but their papers were a little simplistic and not the great intellectual papers I imagined them to be in the beginning. It can be a relief.
176217850,There are a number of reason. Non you can prove.

I also have played and sung several new songs(by other artists), but I’m struggling to remember them, so I pretty much need the sheet music to play."

Then I’d rush back to my other girl who was now up in the air claiming…“I’m going to save the Princess!!”…only to have her plop back down to the ground level…leaving me grasping at thin air again.

But once you find the right med or combination of meds then it’s like wow everything becomes easier, and it’s worth it. So be honest with your pdoc about your side effects and let him know that you’re willing to take meds you just want to find one without side effects. And be patient because it takes a while to find out if a med is going to work and whether a side effect is going to go away or not. Abilify may not be the medicine for. Next month tell your pdoc you want to try something else. Maybe it will actually make you feel better without the medicine head. Anyway, don’t give up."

Even if they don’t use the term “terrorist” to define themselves, they still know they are. My first suggestion would be to look at how a terrorist is defined. terrorist: a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. Based on my perception of your experience, I think your symptoms are creating a questionable reality for you which has left you unable to process and separate what may or may not be real. It’s actually your concern of “omg, what if I am?” that confirms you’re not. If anything, you’d be celebrating if you were since that would be your agenda…essentially installing fear in others.

And that there’s some kind of universal consciousness that is aware of the bigger picture of everything that will happen because it knows the science behind why we chose wat actions we chose and it can see ahead therefore. So the body that we go into when we die is already known by this universal consciousness. I’m not sure what the exact reasons were for why I’d go into one specific person but it was something about having a similar energy vibe, even if they did some things differently… That was wat I thought at the time at least.

176217981,"Yes. I was never supereasy, but in my worst sz period i was disastruous to be close to because off all the extreme emotions, paranoia, etc. That surely affected all relationships."

I also know that there are many people in the same clinic with the same diagnosis who aren’t as high-functioning as I am who also opt out of medication. I think the attitude towards “psychotic spectrum disorders” is changing considerably. Perhaps if they opened up the terminology a bit I would not be labelled “schizophrenic” but as it stands, that’s what I’ve got. I’m sure the people who have successfully gone off medication it might be a similar scenario."

The thing is I’m not sure which other mood stabilizer to replace it with? I’ve been on all the major mood stabilizers, like Tegretol, Lithium, Lamictal and of course Depakote. The million dollar question is can I survive without taking a mood stabilizer? Anyone out there diagnosed with schizoaffective or bipolar and not taking a mood stabilizer? My current diagnosis is bipolar disorder but I’ve also been diagnosed with SZA many times before. I’d like to be able to be on just one psych med, Risperdal."

My voices get louder and more violent, I have a harder time resisting their commands, depression and anxiety goes through the roof, I become dissociative to the point where I hardly react when people talk, and I start thinking people are out to get me.

176217997,"So this may be a bit existential, but I’m having trouble figuring out who I am. For instance, what kinds of principles and attributes make up who I am? The reason this is so difficult for me is that I am quite a different person manic vs. depressed, meds vs. no meds, and different on one med versus another. Add to that my consistent delusions and confusion about reality, and I just don’t know. Anyone else have trouble with this sort of identity crisis? Any ideas as to how to break through?"

I called my doctor and she said would change me back to 4mg instead of 3.5mg. She only lowered it because I was gaining too much weight.

174398379,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [Effect of cognitive impairment on social function and quality of life in chronic schizophrenia]. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, DM _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, _PERSON_, Feb 2020 11 Objective: To clarify the effect of cognitive impairment on social function and quality of life of chronic schizophrenia, and provide clinical cognitive strategies for improving the social function and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Atotal of 158 patients with chronic schizophrenia were selected from May 2017 to October 2017 in the Psychiatry Department of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University received psychological assessments, such as, MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery(MCCB), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale(BPRS), the Personal and Social Performance scale(PSP), and Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale(SQLS). We further explored the effects of neurocognitive and social cognitive functions on their individual and social performance and quality of life in patient
s with schizophrenia. Results: (1) The scores of SQLS in the group with impaired social cognitive function were higher than those with good social function(101±46 vs 76±40, P=0.002). (2) The digital sequence and continuous performance test of the socially functional group were higher than the defect group. (3) There was a significant correlation between the years of education(R(2)=0.334, F=25.542), continuous performance (R(2)=0.316, F=35.647), BPRS (R(2)=0.280, F=60.386) and social function (P<0.001). (4) BPRS (R(2)=0.486, F=228.28), and emotional management (MSCEIT) (R(2)=0.510, F=124.789), education (R(2)=0.531, F=90.161), age (R(2)=0.539, F=69.644) significantly affected the SQLS score of patients with schizophrenia(P<0.001). Conclusion: The social function and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia are significantly correlated with their years of education and disease severity. Continuous performance in neurocognition significantly affects the social function of patients with schizophrenia, and 
emotional management in social cognition significantly affects their quality of life. Socially functional schizophrenia patients have higher digital sequences (working memory) and continuous performance (attention/alertness) scores._USER_ID_???????????????????????????????????????????????????????_USER_ID_ ??2017?5??10??????????????????????158?????????????MATRICS?????????MCCB????????????BPRS????????????PSP??????????????SQLS?????????????????????????????_USER_ID_ ?1???????????SQLS???????????[?101±46????76±40???P=0.002]???????????2?????????????????????????????????????3???????R(2)=0.334?F=25.542???????R(2)=0.316?F=35.647????????BPRS??R(2)=0.280?F=60.386?????????PSP?????????????P<0.001???4???????BPRS??R(2)=0.486?F=228.28???????R(2)=0.510?F=124.789????????R(2)=0.531?F=90.161?????R(2)=0.539?F=69.644???????????????SQLS????P<0.001?? _USER_ID_??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????/???????."

174398397,"In my case it’s the fake/inserted thoughts, but since most people with schizophrenia don’t seem to have fake thoughts I’m asking about voices. The fake thoughts seem to be smarter than me. They’ve pointed out flaws in the plans I had, and reminded me of things that I’ve done wrong/badly and how I could have done better. They also seem to be specialized at showing how bad of a person I am - there have been periods of fake dialogues essentially like a court process, where I was accused of various things I’ve done in my life, and after each accusation another fake thought representing “me” tried to justify it, then “they” found flaws in that, etc; this often went on for hours. Now their theory is that I did those things because I was stupid (they found that I never intended any harm), and that this stupidity is an illness of the soul/consciousness and that it can’t be fixed, which is why I got “caught” (by my schizophrenia) so I could be tortured after death forever (accordin
g to their theory that is an effective way to control me). For example once when I was working for a cleaning service company I had to clean the windows. The wind was quite strong, so often water flew across the window to the window that I had already cleaned. It was cold outside (there was still snow), so each time I tipped the mop in the water my hands got wet and they were freezing in the strong cold wind, so I just wanted to get it done fast. I guess I was also hoping the droplets wouldn’t show, and they didn’t that day because it was cloudy, but the next day was sunny so they became visible, and the windows had to be cleaned again. The fake thoughts are saying I’m essentially a bad person due to things like this, and that I should have told my boss if the wind was too strong or cold, which I didn’t think of, so the fake thoughts say I’m a bad person doing bad things because I’m stupid. Voice(s) also talk about these things, but mostly it’s when the fake thoughts have brought up the topic, a
nd then they comment on what those fake thoughts have said."

176218155,"I have, but I have a past experience with rejecting religious claims. I think you need to research how people become disillusioned with the claims of their specific religions. I don’t want to argue that you should be an atheist, because there’s no reason to. This is simply a degree of insight on what claims your delusion is trying to make on the world. No need to investigate what your religion believes unless there are differences, in which case, you can say…my faith believes this, my delusion believes this other thing, therefore even if I believe it, my religion doesn’t and its my own personal experience. Then you go from there to your own personal experience and try to gauge the facts of what happened, the state of your mind, the obvious flaws in your mind when you are being actively psychotic. This is going to take a while, so work on it slowly."

The first poster titled, “The Novel, Non-D2 Psychotropic Agent SEP-363856 Modulates Presynaptic Dopamine Function in Mice ,” (Poster #M178 ) presented data in support of the novel mechanism of action of SEP-363856. businesswire.com Sunovion Announces Results from Its Open-Label Extension Study of SEP-363856... _PERSON_ announced results from study SEP361-202 evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of SEP-363856, a novel schizophrenia medicine. One of the more replicated findings in schizophrenia models is increased presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity. But this seems like it would be better with fewer side effects if they 
could start at the source and not have excess dopamine in the first place, rather than just block it in multiple regions of the brain, some where it is needed and some where it isn’t. Also I don’t think even in the dopamine hypothesis that scientists think that is the ONLY neurotransmitter that is changed, or even that it’s always changed, in everybody."

I wonder if it has anything to do with my illness- although I think I’m just a generally weird person. You see, since I could remember I have always been eccentric, mainly because my father also exhibits some form of schizophrenia, and has been told he is on that spectrum. But like me he has a difficulty with keeping close friends and SO’s in his life. He also has paranoia. Me and him are so alike. I ask him how do you manage to get by in life with little to no contact from people? He simply says, you know son I just sleep it off and I don’t really worry what other people think or say. I found that to be helpful, but in the same token it made me feel even more lonely. I’m in my early 20s and I haven’t lived like other young men in my community.

176218194,"I did. I still do, but just 0.3mg. I couldnt tolerate a higher dose. (Before reading: I always get more effects and more side effects than others, also according to the psych). I got bad side effects on it, but the side effects on other meds were much worse. I feel in comparison to second generation meds it is quite “pure”. It basicly just numbs you down, in all ways (less emotions, thoughts, energy, motivation, etc). On sg meds like zyprexa i got the same numbing, but also a range of other issues, more physical ones, like weigth gain, metabolic problems, nightmares, hormonal trouble, etc. Haldol didnt cause any of that in me. I also had worse withdrawals on sec gen meds. Haldol did cause akathisia recently when i upped the dose for a while. What i like about Haldol is it works fast and immediately stops all psychosis. It comes at the cost of losing part of your feelings and thoughts. But some people actually like that and say it calms them."

176218199,Zoloft worsened my psychosis. I wouldn’t recommend it.
174398408,"I think the answer is reducing the brain’s oxidative stress to as close to zero as reasonably possible, so the brain isn’t chronically stressed and pumping out copious quantities of adrenaline and kynurenic acid, which cause the schizophrenic symptoms. Some of that stress is lifestyle, but most of it is dietary. Need to take in more antioxidants than pro-oxidants, so the blood brain barrier can heal instead of deteriorate. A damaged blood brain barrier fills the brain with reactive oxygen species, which becomes oxidative stress and mental illness of some form. Acute amounts of ROS in the brain manifest as schizophrenia. Lower amounts manifest as less serious mental illnesses, like anxiety or bipolar. My antioxidant of preference is low ORP water, first it was ionized water, but that had too high pH for my liking, and now it’s hydrogen infused water, which has an even lower ORP but not very high pH. Approach is working for me so far. Symptoms are well in control with even a low antipsychotic d
ose. Went from 12 mg Paliperidone with mumbles to 3 mg with no voices. Repairing the gut and brain barriers are key to getting back to normal."

176218220,Me again! I wanted to mention quick and note this is obviously based on my experiences and perceptions but I’ve always had pretty good intuition for problem solving which led me to research hallucinations and what areas of our brains are effected etc. I had experience before this with extreme heat on my forehead and felt to rub my 1 oz silver coin over the area. Well I perceived the heat rash which had come on seemingly within minutes disappear about as quickly. After then researching I had an idea to try keeping the coin between a Beenie type hat and various parts of my frontal lobe and it worked in keeping me he feeling of something trying to clog that area in different ways. Eventually upon more research decided to tape the coin over the soft spot back top area of my head/ crown chakra. It completely blocked out hallucinations most of the time and about what I’m guessing what would have been put to 80ish percent of the time based on experiential guessing. Now later down the path till now. I
ve started experimenting with emf shielding clothing after doing some research and finding that some seems to be hyped up claims but others had possible validity. The first beenie type thing was wash in blocking stuff that was rated to about 45db blocking capacity. It worked ok but as if a couple weeks ago a got a new beenie off of eBay from a place in China. This one isn’t the wash in type but instead fabric with emf blocking metas In the fabric. It works amazingly. I don’t don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up with any expectation/s based on my success but I can’t recommend trying it just the same. Because it had been a major salvation for my brain. It’s pretty much a nice looking and comfy version of a tin foil hat!! Also this might be more of a sub conscious brain life hack thing bit things work better if we make a mental point of allowing it to work with us. Just my thoughts and wishing you well!

176218224,"If you really want to scare yourself off these drugs, watch _NAME_ “This is Life.” There’s an episode labeled “The Benzos Crisis” or something like that, and she showcases several awful videos from YouTube of people with benzo-withdrawal induced akathisia. I actually don’t really like that episode (I’ve recently been binging ‘This is Life’ on HBO Max) because it ties akathisia in with benzos, when the truth is akathisia can be caused by lots of different drugs, including antipsychotics. I spent a year and a half in akathisia hell from Invega withdrawal. I remember posting here about it. My life was a living hell. Since reducing my Zyprexa dose to 7.5mg and eliminating akathisia I have been a much, much happier human being. It’s important not to adopt an anti-medication standpoint though, as medicine has major advantages. You just need to balance side effect management with medicinal benefit when working out your treatment plan with your psychiatrist."

I just told myself “screw it” and didn’t feel like driving all the way back so I never went back. The damn bow tie was in my shirt pocket the whole time! The boss never liked me anyways after I was tapping some red wine out of the keg and I slipped and spilt red wine all over her white blouse, lol.

176266935,"In order for communication to occur the following is required. two distinct parties who communicate; a protocol (contract) that both parties understand and agree upon; a message that a party wishes to communicate; a medium over which a message is transmitted; Only when a message is serialized in for a known medium, with agreed upon protocol, with the explicit purpose to communicate the message to another party, then it becomes a signal. Otherwise, it is noise. For an example consider smoke signals. A party communicates to another a message that may for example be “danger”, by serializing it into a puff of smoke via a medium of a fire and all related physics. The other party understands the message “danger” because they already agreed on the protocol of what a puff of smoke means."

176266954,"Hi _AT_MENTION_, my son is too. He always was a stubborn kid, and if he decides he’s not doing something, there’s no convincing him. I want him to try supplements and vitamins so badly, but he refuses. It’s very difficult, but just recently I decided to be alittle tougher with him and he’s now “thinking” about things, instead of just flat out saying no. It’s not the norm for me to be like this with him, and I think he’s noticing the change, and responding better to it than before. I’ve started laying my foot down on some things, and it’s working out. I hope your son gradually starts eating alittle more. Sometimes I think reverse psychology works best. If your son refuses food, don’t beg or encourage or show him how upset you are. I know this will be difficult, but I would just shrug it off and say ok. And leave it at that. Sometimes I feel like the harder we want them to do something, the more they resist."
176266955,"My schizo boyfriend is psychotic and become racist. He writes kkk all over his body. And I’m of colour. He hangs out with people that are mostly of colour. I have no idea where this racism is coming from. To make matters worse. He tricked me into a pregnancy. I lied and said I’m not pregnant to buy myself some time. With my baby coming I really don’t know if I can expose my child to him. I have schizophrenia in my family too and the trauma could cause my child to get it too. When I moved in with him, he was loving and the best. He was never like this before. He wants me to see him in hospital. But I just can’t see him like that amymore. He kisses me and calls me baby with racist writing all over his body and ex girlfriends names as well. I tell him that me and him are friends, but of course I still love him and all of this just breaks my heart too. And it’s like he gets pleasure out of seeing the pain in my eyes. He has also put me through hell in other ways. I found out that he was bad m
outhing me to his family. He drove me against my will to drug squalor that had no electricity with thugs and told me that we live there now. He told how he was going to kill me in detail. I want to turn my back on him for my own sanity. But how can I when I’m expecting his child now? I feel heartbroken and cry every night. I can’t even hide the pregnancy for long because my sister is dating his brother. To be honest I have given up on him, he’s second relapse on drugs since I’ve known him. And the doctor said if he uses again he won’t get better, that more damage is done each time he uses. Is there something I can ask his mom to sign on his behalf to release parental rights?"

I miss him so much. He is not accepting to take medication, so I don’t know what else we can do. I have done everything that I could for him. reading every book and scientific paper about this illness, making doctor appointments, try to use LEAP methods. But it seems nothing works I feel so much pain, I did not expect this to happen in my life. I never knew even what is schizophrenia before this.

176266969,"My son had really bad negative symptoms. I felt like the more suggestions I made about his hygiene, the worst things would get. He got better as he got older, but when he is sad, he slips back. He told me once that he didn’t see the point. Nobody came to see him, his friends had all left him, and there wasn’t any point in being presentable. They suffer so much, its just not fair."
176266970,"Just from my own experience with my own son: If I had left him to live on his own his home would have been the exact same way, maybe even worse. Not because he is dirty or likes living that way but because for those as ill as your son or mine: organization is really really hard, -almost impossible for some, even simple things that we take for granted are so hard to do with any consistency. In addition the expectation that they must do these things is an additional stress that is often more than they can handle mentally and emotionally and they just freeze. First I would strongly question your son’s doctor on the medicine regiment that your son is on. He needs to know how debilitated he actually is in his everyday life. Some doctors put their patients on a medication and so long as there is no dramatic (or life threatening) side effects they rely on the word of the patient as to how the medicine is doing. Often if the medicine is not optimal the patient cannot give an accurate or clear account of 
his or her experiences with it or they just say everything is fine-- so the doctor opts for no changes and nothing changes. Someone close to the patient that knows him or her has to observe closely and then advocate on behalf of the patient in order for effective medicine changes to be made. I had fulI guardianship of my son early on so I could sit in on his appointments and be a part of his program. If I was not the guardian then I would be writing the doctor letters letting him know everything I know about my son’s behaviors and reactions to medications. The doctor can refuse to speak to a parent directly when there is no guardianship but any doctor worth his or her salt will take communication from a parent or other family member seriously. I know this is not for everyone, and I fully understand and appreciate that fact: But what helped my son was when I was home with him 24/7 (I was on long term disability myself) and when that happened I began working with him daily on simple things, throwing stuff awa
y properly, looking at dates on food, making food correctly and cleaning up after. Taking the trash out the same day each week. Doing laundry the same day each week. Making a predictable routine. It was re-teaching him things he had already known before he was ill. He was like a small child again in some ways. Often I could see he couldn’t keep up or was tired or unable to comply so I did what had to be done but I always went back to him doing it and now after 10+ years he is able to keep things neat and clean and do all the basics needed. He still has off days but he can do it more often than not. It never gets too bad like it would have and plus I am still here with him. I also learned with my son the more time he spends completely alone without one other person to get what I call “reality clarification” from the more I see delusional thinking creep in. With me around he can say something outlandish and I can now say “no that’s not right” and he accepts that he can trust me on it and he moves on
. It took forever to get here it seems. He has also been on a steady regiment of clozapine and depakote for a very long time and it seems to do the trick. I also understand everyone is different --not all patients respond the same to medicines and interactions with family. I just share my story for what it is worth, if it can help okay great and if it can’t then I am sorry I can’t offer better ideas. I do wish you and your son the best though, whatever that turns out to be."

176266977,Morning! Gggggghhhgfff
176266978,"Did they explain what they meant by “not showing enough effort into his recovery”? Considering that majority of people with schizophrenia don’t have insight into their illness (and thus would not be likely to put a lot of effort into the recovery process), that seems like a very strange reason to ask him to leave the facility. I feel like the whole point of living in a facility is to have staff around to encourage/tell him to take medication, participate in group activities, etc. Unless he is resisting staff to the point of being aggressive, but you mentioned that he is more stable than he has ever been."

In one way i want my son home but on the other hand apart from the stress from my husband , my son is very demanding and rude and bullying to live with and we get on much better him living out . I put him in an apartment 5 min from me that way i keep an eye on him from a distance, as he comes to me a few times a week and i go to him too ."
176266981,Did they suggest you take an antidepressant? Maybe they’re right?
176266982,"He said I have negative symptoms, he tried Wellbutrin and wanted to prescribe Abilify again as my negative symptoms were better on it. Wellbutrin didnt work and I refused the Abilify as it caused me addictions in the past. Then he refered me to ergotherapy but I didnt like it, couldnt do what they asked me to do. He told me to accept my negative symptoms and to try to be happy and in peace with them."
176266983,Who is hating? What are you talking about? Are people mean to you?
176266984,"valegregg58. Hello. I live in NYS & am trying to learn all I can about the ABLE Accnts you mentioned in your April’19 post. Our 35 yr old son was diagnosed at 17 w chronic paranoid schizo. Has had 2 hospitalizations. Can I ask you to please share in a more in-depth post, what your son’s experience has been? Like my son, is he somewhat high functioning - mostly dealing ‘only’ with negative symptoms when on his meds?.. is he able to work periodically? I’ve been on this site for a few years, but have never posted. I hope I can figure out how to. I’d also like to start a ‘thread’ asking anyone with experience with ABLE accnts to share. They sound very promising, but there are some pitfalls if you don’t keep good records. You’re right, I think they would be a Godsend for so many families. At some point I hope to speak with the attorney who created a (modest) trust for our son & get her advice. They don’t cost anything and would be a good supplement to a trust (which are costly) or 
a free stand alone option. Because the Consumer has full control of the funds & can keep as much as $100,000 in it without it affecting how much SSD (or SSI) she receives, it would be a good motivation to work. Since the Consumer can earn more than the earnings cut-off, it means they are not doomed to live in poverty. Here’s the ABLE National Resource Center site: https://www.ablenrc.org. I found it very informative and easy to use. Each state has their own program (a few don’t yet). A great way to supplement housing costs of your loved one without them being penalized by SSA. I’d love to learn how it’s working out for people and what pitfalls they’re finding, if any."
176266985,"Hi _PERSON_! Welcome to a group that understands everything you’re going through and your frustrations with the medication roulette wheel. I’m curious to know why the doctor did a dna test. Was it able to give you any insight? I’ve been thinking of having a PTScan done on my son since I think - after 30 years - that his SZ was triggered by a head injury. Not sure if that would help but one never knows. He is currently on Zoloft, Geodon, _PERSON_ (which is lieu of another med due to prior head injuries) and Depakote. He’s been on numerous promising meds but they all react differently with individuals, so its kind of “if at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try, try, try, (repeat to ad nauseam) try, try … again” Take care of yourself and be blessed!"
176266986,"Well said. When you mourn the “loss” of a loved one to a mental illness, you’re actually mourning the loss of your idealized notion of their potential and past self. But, don’t forget, they’re still there, transformed and full of new challenges and different potentials. Try not to let your grief show, or make unfair comparisons. It reminds me of a pivotal scene in Ordinary People, where Dr. _PERSON_ asks _NAME_ what was the one thing he did wrong, and he says “I hung on.” It’s about learning to live with this new reality and making the best of things—as best you can."
176266987,That must be awful

176266990,"The brain it’s very complex and at the same time from what I have seen pratically everyone with sz is about the same; many years ago I was acquainted with some brothers from church and this couple had a daughter who had probably some palsy and used to work enough to be out of the house; the mother commented to me one day that when the daughter was younger she had a brain tumor and they had to deal with what they had, sometimes she would blurted awful sexual statements, and so my son! Sometimes he implies that his father molests him or ugly stuff about everyone. Please don’t take it personally, I know it hurted me the first times but little by little I know it’s the illness that takes over. With meds our son is fine without them it’s hell for everyone concerned. And as I’ve seen it over and over you can’t force the meds I wish I could force them on our son, you can’t. They have this incredible physical strength. I wish you the best. You have been a great sister. There’s not too many 
like you. Take care."

176267000,"You are such a wealth of knowledge and it really helps reading your posts. I am just trying to understand what the best way for me to interact with my brother so that he will trust me in the future. My parents were the ones dealing with him for most of his life post schizophrenia. I was living in another state and raising a family. I definitely saw my brother when I came to visit, but our conversations were all on the surface. Now my father is dead and my mother has dementia, so it will be me that will have to figure out what his future will look like. The only way I can move forward with that is if I build trust with him."

176267006,"Well, had a talk with my husband this morning and he agreed to see his psychiatrist tomorrow as scheduled and to follow instructions, even if it means going back on medications (which most likely it will). I did pretty well using LEAP. Once he realized that I was acknowledging that the ball was totally in his court in all ways (i.e. whether or not he attends the appointment, whether or not I come with him, what he tells his doctor, and whether or not he complies with any recommendations), he came on board with giving it a try, despite his conviction that I am “working against him” with unknown others. Hopefully, he will follow through and things will improve. I am feeling at peace with things at the moment. Prior to talking with him, I had to get to a place of acceptance that I have no control over either the course of his illness or how he chooses to manage things. And also with the fact that our relationship may or may not weather this. I told him that I was proud of us both: we clearly are t
wo people who love each other very much, as we have had to deal with some extraordinary circumstances that would have broken most couples and that whatever happens next in terms of our relationship, that I feel good about us, as individuals and as a couple. He seemed to appreciate this. Unfortunately, I do think he is quite prone to tardive dyskinesia (which is why we had to take him off the medication back in January). From my reading, older people are more likely than younger people to develop these symptoms and there appears to be some familial tendency for this in his family. Given this, I was really hoping he’d be able to maintain stability without medication (he was on half of the smallest dose he could take for a couple of years and still developed symptoms of TD). But it is not looking like he is one of the lucky ones. Or not in this way. But this is something for him and his psychiatrist to address. And on the positive side, he has been able to have a reasonably decent life and we did have the chan
ce to have a good marriage. So, however it goes, things could have been worse. Wish us luck, please."
176267007,I’m scared of the dentist cuz they put me to sleep
176267008,What injection was it?
176267009,"Yes similar here with our son, he’s 28 and was first hospitalised 5 years ago this month. He’s had many different meds. Currently back in abilify 15mg tablet and fluoxetine 20mg. He can be fine, happy and engaged and then another day he can be in a dark mood and I too know when he is heading for a rant / argument. It’s exhausting yes, and some days when I strong I cope well , other days I’m not so strong and it is like a dark cloud hanging over me, a huge weight in my shoulders . My son and hubby often clash too, hubby is more quick to react when sometimes picks on us, accuses us etc. My son sometimes gets angry and “them” the doctor is, the police, and just “them” He says they targeted him since being a young boy and stole his soul. He has had little / no insight on every med whether it be depot or oral meds… He graduated from university and worked for a few months till this hit him. He’s not worked since 2014. He says sometimes that ,he wants to but , they won’t employ him o
r that he won’t work where he will be treated badly as he said he was before etc. It’s tough , but here on this site you will find so many people who just get it and understand you."
176267010,I was on Tegretol for years in the past. Same reason. It interacts with lots of different meds including my Risperdal. Plus she feels that Tegretol would be too “weak” for me. She feels that I need to be on a potent mood stabilizer like Depakote. Thanks _AT_MENTION_

176267025,"Hey guys I am thinking of getting myself hospitalised this coming monday for panic attacks. I’ll be honest Im a little nervous about being hospitalised. Whenever I have my anxiety attack, I feel unsafe so I thought hospitalisation would be an option. I managed to get an earlier appointment with with my pdoc this Monday. What do you guys think? Should I get myself hospitalised or should I just learn to deal with my anxiety attacks. But my anxiety attacks feel overwhelming. Im afraid I might get an anxiety attack when _PERSON_ outside and lose control."
176267026,"I used to get terrible gut pain, so bad that I felt I couldn’t go into work. But my job was at a gas station where people often called in sick just cause they partied the night before. Everyone didn’t want them to hire more people cause then we’d get less hours. So I just came into work sick…this way they knew I was sick and if they felt like it they could send me home. So this happened like a dozen or so times and eventually I just hobbled around till I had to go to the bathroom and then I’d feel better. It actually became everytime somebody wanted or needed time off they would want to trade shifts with me cause I’d come in sick or not, whereas if you traded shifts and your trader didn’t show up management would fire or reprimand you."

This is no easy ride but we all need to be strong for them . one day at a time …"
176267030,Thanks all for the info - she gets an MRI Wednesday so I suppose we’ll see if anything like a tumor/stroke is going on. I will keep you posted. Just for clarification - the symptom she is exhibiting is that she will change topic mid sentence and then start going from topic to topic - non of which are related. When it is happening it can be very hard to understand her.

176267037,"_AT_MENTION_ I agree that it is early but it just makes my heart burst in joy to read of the dramatic change for your son (and you)!! Keep us posted on your journey! My son continues to do well on Clozapine now 16 months, but it has been slow and steady. As he is applying for jobs (interviews but no hire yet) and we are discussing helping him out with a vehicle (he has not driven, really, in 2.5 years) and expecting a move eventually from his current group home (apartment) to a REAL apartment, he recently told me two things that are huge for us: (1) He would take his med “of course”, and see the doctor and go do his blood draws and (2) that he had shared “his story” (the long version) with a RN in his small group at the church he attends. It is still hard for him to talk about his journey, but he has come a long way and we are just so incredibly grateful for what we have today and hope for the future."
176267038,I’m glad you have an appointment. I hope you’re ok and you get the help you need

This is the end. Unfortunately I find it highly triggering, as it relates heavily to many different psychoses and acid trips that stick this story together. It’s ??????? weird, but I like it.

I’m sorry to hear about your brother"
176267044,"My apologies in advance for responding. There actually is a program that pays people to take care of family members that meet the qualifications of need. My brother had to quit his job to take care of his adult son with autism. His wife had the higher paying job, she continued to work. Their son had aged out of the school system (lots of official documentation there regarding his limitations and was removed from the development disorder work program for attacking an instructor (more documentation) attacking an instructor made him ineligible for the day drop off program. During some sort of home needs assessment visit, the social worker became aware that they had to lock up all of the food in their house, pantry and refrigerator (the refrigerator had chains and a padlock) their other son had to arrange his college schedule to help cover the gaps in his parents work schedule as his older brother could not be left alone in the house for even a minute. During the assessment, my nephew stomped around th

176267045,"My sister is 56 and lives with my mother and is her primary caretaker. I also live in the home, but work full-time. My mom and I were joking around when my sister wasn’t home about how sneaky she is when she writes. Now I’ve been in her room and the only thing I ever see is bible verses thumbtacked to the wall, so I never thought twice about it. Yesterday, I was putting some things in her room and out of curiosity, I picked up her notebook. Not my proudest moment; but I’m not sorry that I did it. In her notebook were letters demonstrating that she is having delusions of being married to some old rock star and accusing the wife of another old musician she used to listen of harassing her. The letters were demanding astronomical amounts of money and accusing the harasser of sending her messages through the television. I am intercepting packages that her husband is sending her (my Amazon orders). And so on. I wish I had known about this over the weekend since she had her quarterly appointment on 
Monday. Now she doesn’t go back for three months. I talked to her and reassured her that all packages coming to the house were ordered by me or Mom and that there were no recording devices in the house watching her. I came clean about reading her letters. I’m thinking that since she is nonviolent, that maybe I should just leave her be until closer to her next appointment or do I ask her to call the doctor and make a new appointment. I feel bad that I didn’t realize that she was having problems sooner, but now all the little annoying things that have developed over the past couple of years make sense."

176267066,"_AT_MENTION_: Yes, the system is so difficult and we all suffer from this, how could anyone with a sever mental illness ever navigate the system? Wow, the DA - what a complete jerk! Your court is very unforgiving with mental illness - so, so sad, really breaks my heart! AOT services are for repeated arrests also, not just hospitalization. These states do not have AOT services Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, where are you? Maybe your attorney could assist with mandated medication or getting him in front of a judge that understands mental illness? I found that going to _USER_ID_, The Department of Mental Health and any mental health educational classes and meeting key players to call when I needed help was invaluable. I was having a difficult time getting conservator ship and the director of the DMH, Dr. _NAME_ said you call me next time he’s in the hospital and I will get this pushed through for you. Luckily, my son is stable and we haven’t had a next time, but I have his number very c
lose and I will call when needed. The Los Angeles DMH admits that the system is broken and is trying hard to implement change, which is awesome! My son is currently approved for section 8 independent and supportive housing (he had to meet criteria with homelessness on the application - I lied, I work my butt off to keep him from being homeless!), but the wait lists are so long. The cycle continues and we’re always here to protect them, but it is indeed extremely difficult. Xo"

176267069,"Hello, My 32 year old son has Schizophrenia. He also has huge boils and psoriasis on his hands and feet. Currently on Clozapine 50mg day. Wears a coat often in summer. Smokes a pack a day and bathing is a struggle. I saw an article that linked a skin disease called “hidradenitis suppurativa” (HS) with schizophrenia. I pulled up pictures of HS and saw this… The same huge boils my son has. Then I read this man’s experience with _PERSON_ ( in the article his HS went away and his kids PSORIASIS vanished). The Paleo Diet - _PERSON_ on Paleolithic nutrition, intermittent fasting, and... – 9 Apr 12 Putting Hidradenitis Suppurativa Into Remission I have had a condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) for over 20 years. Never heard of it? I’m not surprised. It’s the Leprosy of the 21st century. HS sufferers will inadvertently break out in boils and cysts in delicate areas of their bodies... The cause in the article is nightshades vegetables. Below is a partial list of American nightshades
… To review, the foods you want to stay away from are eggplants, tomatoes, tomatillos, potatoes, Goji berries, pimentos, ground cherries, bell peppers, chili peppers, paprika, cayenne, and the tobacco leaf. I have suspected his illness has been associated with his boils and psoriasis for a long time. Currently, I have him in the Dominican Republic with a family that gently controls his diet. It is 3rd world and there are no insecticides, antibiotics, steroids in the animals. But he still has the boils.

176267075,"Hi _AT_MENTION_. I have so much sympathy for what you’re going through with your son. My brother has schizoaffective disorder. While I personally have never had to call 911 for him, I remember my parents having to wait until he was “ill enough” to warrant 911 sending a crisis team to evaluate him. I think you followed the correct course of action. As an outsider reading your story, I can imagine the sheriff not being convinced that your son was ill enough to be committed if all he was doing was sitting in the shower for hours, but you turning the water source off forced your son to do something else that provided more evidence that he was unwell. I think sitting in the middle of the street would be proof enough, and it was, that your son needed professional help at that point. My suggestion to you would be to follow your gut as you did this last time. It may be, unfortunately, that your son may need some interference from you in order to demonstrate that he is unwell enough to need profession
al involvement. With my brother, it took three hospitalizations for him to put two and two together–that avoiding being handcuffed and taken to the hospital meant compliance with his medications. Each time our loved ones fall off the wagon and need help is torturous, but it also begins a paper trail of their condition which opens doorways to them getting the help they so desperately need and deserve. Sending you strength and hope."

176267085,"_AT_MENTION_ untreated people with mental illness can be violent, but the effectively treated ones less so. They often shun society which gives them fewer opportunities for conflict. Whether this fully balances the equation is unclear. There’s a sizable population of mentally ill people incarcerated in the US initially for minor crimes, but from experience with my brother continuing or resuming needed treatment is tough, because it’s difficult to get prescribed medications into jails and prisons so folks go untreated or receive poor care. Close conditions and other factors unfavorable to mental health exacerbate situations that lead to violence which in turn can lead to longer stays, rinse, wash and repeat. There’s also the problem of true criminals malingering, hoping for transfers to mental health facilities for better treatment and access to free psychotropic drugs they can use or sell, raising opportunities for violent or exploitative criminals to invade mental wards, ala _NAME_s famous d
epiction of _NAME_. After visiting several psych wards and being hospitalized one time, my observations are doors are often locked to limit exit paths and control traffic flow, but wards and individual rooms aren’t fully locked. Usually main doors are supervised, but not locked. From my experience, being admitted to a mental ward can be bewildering and disorienting and I found I was prone to getting lost. I tend to pace when anxious or agitated and I remember bemused titters when I took a wrong turn and wandered into staff offices. Some patients are suicide risks and as such should not be allowed to wander off unsupervised for their own protection. When I was first admitted I was put on a program called “special checks” where a nurse would hunt me down wherever I wandered to, note my location and periodically check my blood pressure. Over time, I became aware of the rules and scrupulously followed them, because I knew it would shorten my stay. I wasn’t sure exactly what the purpose of the checks were, 
but it may have something to do with assessing my acclimation and possible suicide risk. There’s also logistical challenges that come with supervising patients with varied cognitive and emotional deficits. Meals need to be served on schedule, outdoor recreation needs to be supervised, “activities” like exercise, musical and art therapy, or group sessions attended, even simple things like shaving in the morning were challenging, because razors were kept locked up and doled out and shaving supervised. Add to this the logistical nightmare of getting the many addicted smokers and vapers to designated smoking areas, and you could see why locking a few doors and controlling access might be necessary. My stay was before smoke free environments existed, so I can only imagine what a nightmare this must be now, and I’m sure precautions for stemming transmission of the current pandemic only make this harder. My take on this is it’s no more restrictive than a nursing home and less so than a “memory care facil
ity”. I’m curious where you are getting your information about violence and the locking of hospital doors and such. Is it from personal experience, or various media? I can assure you that most if not all media depictions of mental wards and facilities are outdated and inaccurate. Troupes of escaped mental patients and spooky, poorly lit mental wards or “asylums” abound, yet because of _USER_ID_ and privacy concerns the public rarely see mental wards or hospitals, so these troupes persist and imaginations of production designers run wild. Per training of police to handle mental health situations, I should think that recent protests around the world should make the value of this clear for all health situations including and especially mental illnesses. In many cases police are the only ones with legal authority to take people to mental care facilities against their will by legal means. Often by the time mentally ill people encounter the police they are disruptive, uncooperative, mouthy and confused and 
can behave and speak unpredictably and bizarrely due to psychosis. These signs can be misinterpreted as violent or provoking violence and can lead to resistance that can turn violent or deadly— most likely with the police prevailing. There should be more of this training, not less, because its purpose is to deescalate tensions and avoid violence rather than unwittingly provoke it. Because current laws in the states often have a bar of “harm to self and others” as a prerequisite to psychiatric holds and the police often are the only ones with authority to transfer people to mental health facilities, it’s a recipe for possible violent conflict if officers aren’t properly trained. There is a transition to properly trained multidisciplinary crisis teams to handle these situations, and if anything good is to come from the poorly articulated “defund the police” movement, it would be to make these sorts of teams more consistent and prevalent."
176267086,"Honestly, I think a court mandate for medication is good, if the person won’t medicate on their own initiative. I’m sorry he is pushing you away. Maybe that is intentional, maybe not. Of course you find it confusing, that is normal. My daughter has been on a monthly injection of haldol since Dec 2018 when she was arrested and ordered onto medication or stay in jail. I don’t think she remembers most of her past (when psychotic). It was a scary time for her and for me. I was almost worn out with trying to cope. It is so very hard, really hard, and I mean REALLY hard, to care for someone with severe mental illness. And yet it is so hard to let go, and let them be their own destructive enemy. I am VERY lucky that everything aligned to get her force medicated on the best of 4 medicines tried on her. She is doing well in a “new” life, compared to her before life, it isn’t what she wanted, but now, well… it’s a good life. Thank you for asking about her."

176267097,You have been most helpful. I greatly appreciate the suggestions. I will look into LEAP. I was the only one he trusted and all of the sudden that was gone. I have always listened and been extremely careful on how I respond to the things he tells me. The last text message he sent me (which was last night) was “You’re ridiculous. Admit what your doing or leave me the F@*$ alone.” He thinks I am telling the entire family to mock him. That is exactly what he has thought about his last companies that he has worked for. Should I admit to doing something I’m not doing just to get back in his good graces? I did give a vouge apology but that was not good enough. I worry that I was the only one he talked to and now that is gone.
176267098,"Oh my, certainly I felt guilty when I called the police, spoke to the judge and gave Ok for my daughter to be force injected. It feels terrible to impose these things on your adult daughter. And it doesn’t get easier when you have to do it again, and again, as sometimes the first time isn’t enough. But, I can tell you that whatever I did that made me feel guilty during my daughter’s years of psychosis doesn’t make me feel guilty anymore. She has been helped out of the pit of psychosis by luck, _PERSON_ of God, or my sheer persistence at trying to help her even at a great cost to me. For her, the right medicine worked almost immediately, and is still working, but it was NOT the first medicine she was put on. I think only trial and error (and a journal I kept so I could remember all details) worked. Don’t feel guilty, you are trying to help someone who can’t help themselves."

I will shorten my thoughts too much to go through at this time, but YES DEFINITELY THC is a HUGE contributor to bringing forth and unmasking the psychosis, paranoia, delusions, auditory hallucinations and all the negative symptoms this illness endures and wears on our loved ones and ourselves. Due to the denial my son holds dear to his heart about his illness, he believes marijuanna will help him and cure him and that he doesn’t need the Invega Sustenna 254 mg. injections monthly or his anti anxiety meds and that all he needs is the right weed, and the doctors don’t know what they’re talking about. He thinks no one but he knows what he needs and what helps him. The APs help with the psychosis and some of the symptoms but the negative symptoms are stronger than any meds my son has had and learning how to function and manage in this stressful world takes a tremendous amount 
of effort from everyone in the family. He doesn’t realize the reason he wants to smoke pot is to be high and not in reality, because reality is way more uncomfortable for him to try to be a part of. I am hurting today. I’m sad. I’m frustrated. I am trying so hard to be whole again from the past 9 months of my 28 year old son’s trauma, suicide attempts, hospitalizations, therapy, discontinuing therapy, maintaining medical injections and just life. Trying to help my 18 year old be excited to be going away to college next year. Keeping the family together ( I have 4 sons and am engaged to someone I’ve been with for 10 years, who now doesn’t know if he can handle this illness, that’s a post for a different spot).

I’m not blaming lithium. But it was 100% the reason for my hypothyroidism. When I stopped it. Yep it went back to normal. Saw a doc specialist for it and she confirmed lithium caused it.

I’m glad that you are getting some counseling yourself. Taking care of yourself is the best thing you can do. Sometimes self care drops out, and that’s not a good thing.

I got rejected from a med change for 6 months before I found an online supplement that actually diminished my symptoms. It’s called Amyloban 3399. I go to a clinic where it’s all resident doctors that change every year. They all have different philosophies and some are more proactive than others. But when I tried to switch psychiatrists, it was impossible finding one in my area that is known to consider the best interests of the patient and is also available. I went to a “random” one and she immediately tried to start me off with the most sedating med there is so I ended up back at my old clinic. If you’re worried, try going to the emergency room. Fortunately, I have insight but when I clearly explain my delusions to the doctor, she thought I was ok. Hopefully your son gets the treatment he needs, gets a second opinion, etc."

He has no idea what he has spent money on. So we bail him out again. It’s so bad that you have to rely on them doing something criminal, get police involved before you get help. But it’s happened here so many times. Police are generally good. One gave me his own cell phone number if I needed help and he would make sure my son got an appointment with a good police dr on call that night. The spitting, I still don’t understand that and why he says it’s because he is smoking and has a bad taste in his mouth. Denies voices but often laughs to himself when he is alone.

I’m trying to be consistent in using the “I’m not sick, I don’t need help” book suggestions in communicating with him, but it’s so frustrating because it’s difficult for him to carry on a realistic conversation.

It seems to work for us when we don’t push everything under the rug & try to run from it. I often talk about what he did while in psychosis, he looks at me with disbelief. One thing I can never get him to talk about are the voices he used to hear and what they were saying to him. All he ever said about that was that it was “bad”. He made it very clear that subject was “off limits”. I do believe A daily half hour activity helps to keep him on track. Something small and short to ground him for the day. I buy him middle school math books, crossword puzzles, word search. So far he hasn’t refused them, and tells me when he’s done with a book."

Instead, I listen a great deal, do my best to have patience, and have convinced him that medical providers might be able to quiet the voices and threats.

176267153,"It makes my heart break to read all these posts. If you are not already aware, one positive note is that there ARE advocacy groups that are trying to get laws changed and educate others about the significant needs we have in the world of serious mental illness. You can follow the Treatment Advocacy Center, Mental Illness Policy Org. (_PERSON_), _USER_ID_, SAMSHA (under the new director Dr. _PERSON_), and the journalist _NAME_ who reports on these things. These organizations don’t always agree 100%, but it seems like progress is being made. The more of us that become educated to support what these organizations are doing, to write letters to our Congress persons, and become advocates ourselves, the better chances are to help our loved ones (and ourselves)."
176267154,"Welcome to this site _AT_MENTION_. I am glad you found us, but sorry that your son is having delusions. Unfortunately, the majority of the time when someone is delusional or hallucinating, they don’t believe they are ill, they believe their (incorrect) assumptions like the parasites your son knows are there, or the voices they hear are special beings and they have been chosen. It is called anosognosia to not recognize that you are ill. You most likely will not be able to convince him he has delusions. There is a book called “I am not Sick, I Don’t Need Help” by Dr. _NAME_ that helped me to understand my daughter’s severe mental illness. My daughter never accepted help, it had to be forced on her, but she is doing well now. It was a long road that took over 4 years. Keep coming here and reading, the more knowledge you can get, the more chances you will find to help him. Plus the support here from people who understand is very valuable."
176267155,"Hi, My son is also 30 with PSZ. Your story sounds very similar to our struggles with my son. My wife (not his mother) and I have guardianship and conservatorship of my son. It is difficult to achieve, but not impossible. It may be different in Florida, so I suggest strongly that you consult a lawyer who is familiar with gaining both those things. Once you have them, you can control his money and assets. (My son ran up considerable credit card debt and bought crazy things during the time we had no control over him.). He receives SS disability (not much, something) and we give him an allowance every week, so he can save money. The guardianship allows you to control which medicines he takes also per the doctors advice. Does he have a diagnosis of PSZ? Why does the doctor only give him anxiety and depression meds? Maybe he needs a new doctor? A psychiatrist for sure. A clear diagnosis for sure."

176267157,"So many good things in this thread…not sure how I lost track of it… The memory thing, or lack of, is interesting. I see this with my MI partner. He doesn’t seem to have much recollection at all of his years I call his ‘constant crisis’ years. Entire ongoing life experiences, engagements, behaviors, generally exquisitely poor choices, hygiene and lifestyle… just gone. Which is hard for me personally because I DO remember and some of it left residual impacts and effects for me and others close to him, and none of it can ever be talked about because of corse ‘that never happened. You’re lying’ etc. etc. I’ve often found myself thinking the same as OldLadyBlue, that it’s a way his mind might be protecting itself from its own traumas. Maybe what was happening for him (and us) in reality was in conflict or contradictory to his ‘internal self identity’, and he couldn’t claim it as it often betrayed how he saw himself and his own beliefs as the true person he identifies as. It
s hard to remind myself that a person suffering delusions will inherently be imbued with the talent of confabulation, creating scenarios of events in their mind or memory to confirm or validate their belief regardless of facts presented that contradict it, it’s not just excuses. And the ‘flip-flop’ behaviors, I call them, that _PERSON_ mentioned are very familiar to me also. Chaotic, angry, often violent outburst of all kinds of random nonsensical accusations often followed by running manic out of the house only to happen on a neighbor and suddenly it’s all gone, a completely civilized person having a friendly conversation with the neighbor walking their dog (…WTF?!?.. and my heart is still pounding and my hands still shake and my breath still choking me in my chest because I was trying to remain calm and collected and reasonable…really? _PERSON_…wow! My nerves are shot) On therapy. CBT (cognitive behavior therapy). When I still had my own delusion that I’d be able to get my MI partner into t
herapy willingly because he’d suddenly gain insight, and maybe we’d be able to find a neurologist or better yet a neuropsychiatrist (fat chance. I was obviously off my rocker) I also ran into difficulty finding anybody who used CBT as one of their modes AND had experience with SZ. In fact, there were none. But I loved how Hope, your son, was able to use this to his mind as a ‘life coach’. He identified goals for wanting to engage and maybe better develop his skills at meaningful relationships for himself. As long as he didn’t think the therapy was because he was ‘sick’. I think I may be coming close to getting my partner to talk to a relationship counselor, as it doesn’t hold him accountable or suggest that it’s him that’s sick, but rather ‘we’ can work on (or me). Baby steps, right? I also thought I should mention CBT is the basis for something called SMART Program. Stands for Self-Management and Recovery Training. It was initially instituted as an alternative for say an AA or NA supp
ort but has become widely used for any impulse-based issue like quitting cigarettes, managing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, PTSD, eating disorders, sex disorders etc. The idea is to train yourself to identify precursor negative thoughts and distinguish them from your feelings and teach yourself then to manage the negative or irrational thoughts or beliefs then rationalize through the choices you make that lead to the behaviors you’re trying to avoid. Kind of like the old ‘just because you think it doesn’t make it true’. This is a globally active and recognized program, has multiple live groups every day, and is available online free anywhere you can get internet. I don’t know that it can be accessed via mobile devices, I imagine for privacy security issues, but it may be something worth checking into. You can get a workbook used on amazon I think too for pretty cheap if you’d just like access to the basic fundamentals. Finally (sorry so long) thoughts on anti-psychotic meds. The side ef
fects can be pretty horrific, especially with what are referred to as ‘first generation’ AP drugs. Things like tardive dyskinesia (tremors, jerking, involuntary movements of the limbs or face like chewing or tonguing) can be pretty upsetting for both caretakers and for our loved ones. We used Seroquel (a ‘second generation’ AP) for my mother when she progressed into what’s called Loui-Bodies dementia, generally characterized by intense fear and paranoia, (lucky for us she was more often just mildly agitated and non-violent). My partner has a sibling that also suffers MI but has and always has had insight, and uses Seroquel as a PRN (as needed). Best of thoughts to all of you and stay strong. As always, remember to be good to ourselves!"
176267158,"Thanks for this clarification. What I’m hearing is you think hospitalization will somehow force these decisions on him. This isn’t always the case, while court assisted treatment coerces compliance by offering a stark choice of medication compliance versus jail, patients have the right of refusal of medication. Once admitted voluntarily or no, there is a degree of pragmatically going along with treatment to get yourself out sooner, but in my experience this is unlikely to be lasting. There has to be a motivating factor and some tangible benefits to try something new and stick with it. This may be a carrot or stick or both. In my case, I came to the realization that I would likely lose my job if I didn’t at least try medication. After that motivating factors for switching to different medications were largely on promises of less onerous side-effects. Anxiety at medication transitions is normal, there’s a degree of “the devil you know…” mentality. I’d consider access to you and your c
hildren as a possible motivator. If you are unfamiliar with the LEAP method, consider researching the forum or getting a copy of Dr. _PERSON_’s book, “I Am Not Sick, I Don’t Need Help!” for consensus building strategies for improving relationships with those with serious mental illness. _USER_ID_’s Family To Family training is reportedly also a good resource."

For the past few days there’s been more paradoxical laughter than usual, which can be disturbing. He’s 2 weeks out of a psychiatric ward of a hospital. His only talking therapy is with a psychiatrist for 30 min a week via phone. He says he doesn’t want to talk to a psychologist, which he used to do up until a couple of years ago. When he’s less symptomatic he can sell books online and make maybe $400/month. He has no social life outside of our house, but was never one to socialize anyway. I don’t think we can encourage him to be more sociable at this point. He did form a relationship with a woman about 10 years ago and lived with her. They got married but it ended badly after about a year and they got divorced. For the past 3 years there have been zero friends in his life.

176267179,"In dual diagnosis situations it’s difficult to sort this out. My brother has bipolar disorder that is seemingly untreated, I can’t be sure what he does. I’ve watched him drink and there seems to be a fairly low threshold he can pass where he gets increasingly incoherent and seemingly psychotic and he’ll sober up and seem okay-ish for a while. Psychosis when you have Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder are more of a constant or long-lived state. Alcohol or other drug related psychosis is shorter lived and waxes and wanes with levels of intoxication. But with access to enough alcohol and maintaining a fairly constant level of intoxication it can be harder to tell the difference. My experience is drug-related psychosis is more chaotic and unpredictable and belligerent than ‘organic’ psychosis. Organic psychosis has more consistent themes, ‘coherence’ and ‘logic’, if that makes sense. Both are irrational, but one is more ‘structured’ than the other."
176267180,How did your son on his meds?
176267181,"I didn’t like Invega myself, but maybe it’s what you need to completely get better. And yeah…it is expensive."
176267182,"Experiences vary. I’ve covered much of mine in previous posts if you search my posting history, but here’s a consolidated version. I’ll triangúlate to the mindset in a scattershot way, offering a number of analogies hoping some may resonate. An explanation I often use is an excuse people use when an amusing anecdote doesn’t land: “you had to be there.” You don’t “get it”, because you didn’t experience it which is why it was compelling in the first place, and there’s little I can do to put you in my shoes. It’s not the story, but the experience that matters, so looking at it from a logical and objective perspective fails. It seems harder for people who are more concrete and “grounded” to imagine the experience of others when they know that the experience wasn’t “real”. To them reality is chiefly sensation— not perception. The “reality” of all or most of perception and cognition is illusion, your brain tricks you into to thinking there are objective “realiti
es” and “truths”. One strength I find over people who haven’t experienced psychosis is I know this and as such am less trusting of my mind and senses— it makes me a better scientist, engineer and thinker. But it doesn’t make my experiences any more accessible to others, and as such I hide them, and it requires a great deal of trust to open up about them— if at all. Another analogy I’ve used is recovery’s like waking up from a vivid dream. There’s a phenomenon I experience, and I assume most dreamers do, where I wake up with a start and I’m in a transitional state where I’m reorienting myself to what’s reality and what parts of what I recall was a dream, and where the content of the dream came from and why. Recovery from psychosis is a similar, but more gradual process. As with dreams you might forget them immediately, or details become _USER_ID_ or you get confused about what was real and what was dream. You might be haunted by your dreams or attach elevated importance to them or fee
l they are prophetic or revealing or make you feel special. They may puzzle or disgust or scare or embarrass you, and often you must be very careful when describing their content to others. They may recur or fit a theme or you may dread going back to sleep out of fear what you might dream next. And so on. As with dreams some delusions may seem pleasant, familiar or comforting and you might even look forward to them and miss them when they are over, but you realize it’s impractical to spend your whole life asleep. Another model of psychosis my first therapist encouraged was to look on my experience as a form of fictional narrative my psyche devised and lived through as a means of “becoming” or defining myself. She’s Jungian and in Jungian jargon it’s adjacent to a process they call individuation. If this sounds woo-woo or abstract, I’ll use an example of a fairytale (which are staples of Jungian theory) most parents tell their children and actively encourage delusions associated with it— namely t
he _NAME_ myth. I bring this up, because recovery is similar to how children lose their belief in _NAME_. Over time they see inconsistencies or hear stories from peers or siblings about the big lie, but snap back to belief because the story comforts them, or put on a self-interested front of believing for their parents to continue the presents or to spare their younger siblings, etc. For me it was a gradual process, I recall pointing out a price tag for a local store on a gift and suspending my own disbelief by saying, “I guess Santa shops there too.” It’s an imperfect model for recovery, since children rarely revert to believing in Santa once they figure things out— still they look on the experience with nostalgia and relive it through their children. It’s a participatory version similar to what _NAME_ coined the “mono myth” and related to _PERSON_’s theory of the “collective unconscious.” Some writers call it “lying to tell the truth.” And Jungians view those who recover as akin to s
haman who return with wisdom to share with others to heal or teach. Finally, some people look on the experience in a spiritual or metaphysical sense. I’m largely agnostic, but certain aspects felt to me like being “touched by the hand of God” and I understand how shaman might attribute the experience with entering spirit world and feeling their visions prophetic. There’s duality of the experience as if you are in two worlds at once, possibly experiencing two truths simultaneously. My mind goes to the science fiction of parallel universes and being caught in a nexus as a possible explanation, because both experiences feel real and compelling and while the practical earth-bound me tells me none of that stuff is real, the intuitive and spiritual side isn’t sure, hence I’m agnostic— I literally “don’t know” what was real or not, but make a practical choice to remain in this world, and am wary to even mention my other realities. _NAME_ was once asked how with all his accomplishments in the fiel
d of mathematics, how he could possibly have come to believe his outlandish delusions. He said they came to him intuitively in much the same way as his mathematical discoveries. They felt right, so he pursued them with conviction. Unfortunately most delusions are inherently unprovable, or rather difficult to prove definitively untrue to a believer— they wouldn’t have much longevity if this was easy. Hope this explains the mindset and the experience a bit better, it’s difficult question to wrestle with, but I’d rather wrestle with it in recovery than not have a recovery at all."

176267188,Very nice. Impressive as always.
176267189,"I’ve reached a similar conclusion with my brother. I’d found it puzzling his psychosis comes and goes often with drink in the picture. It’s very different than my experience with psychosis, but I drink very little. Lately it’s been happening seemingly in mid telephone conversation or voicemail message. In the space of a two minute message or phone call he can go from conciliatory and apologetic to raving and angrily threatening, punctuated with a hang up. And he’ll repeat this cycle over and over again, all through the night and into the morning. It’s so disruptive I’ve set up his number as a do-not-disturb between 10 pm and 7 am without remorse. In reading up on later stage alcoholism many of his symptoms which he attributes to allergies, his “exceptional” version of bipolar disorder and “tiger blood”, align better with cirrhosis. He’s developed recurrent nosebleeds, insomnia, amnesia, “allergy attacks” resembling panic attacks, bizarre delusions seeking to explain thes
e symptoms like extreme ragweed allergies in the dead of winter, Toluene poisoning from a printing factory, allergies to ingredients from a candle factory many miles away, etc etc. Apparently as the liver begins failing, ammonia starts building up in the blood triggering brain disfunction, B-1 deficiencies interfere with brain function triggering _PERSON_’s encephalopathy which brings temporary confusion, vision and movement issues and later memory issues of Korsakoff Syndrome. Together the Thiamine deficiency syndromes are called WKS, otherwise known as “wet brain”. All well and good to know all this, but the practical understanding we’ve gained is his answer to all his symptoms is to drink more, leading him to talk batshit crazy (to use my other brother’s technical term) with no end in sight, beyond seemingly death."

Normally I just give them to her for separation anxiety. The vet told me to experiment with them according to her needs and we need to deal with this barking. (This morning she did it at 5:30am) It's most certainly disturbing the neighbors. (I live in an apartment.) Dealing with some anxiety right now but it's not overwhelming--a 4 out of 10, I'd say.

176267197,"Hello, So appreciative to have found this site. I have just one sibling, who is 12 years younger than me. She was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder “high functioning” 30 years ago. She is unmarried and had been living independently with well paying employment for several years, but lost her job ten years ago, finding only employment since that leaves her paycheck to paycheck. As she has entered middle age, the symptoms she had successfully taken medication for have changed and she now additionally seems to have an anxiety disorder that basically incapacitates her frequently so that she often leaves work early or needs to be driven home. She has panic attacks regularly. That detail is not what I joined to group initially to discuss, although it’s causing havoc in her life and she is currently in her second temporary inpatient facility in a month. I would really just like to say hello to any other siblings out there and extend my empathy. I am hoping to find some answers as I read others
 experiences as I worry and try to plan for her future. Both parents passed 8 years ago. They were hoping for a different outcome and were in somewhat denial and did not act on trying to establish any future support. There are no other adult family members on either side of our family, aunts or uncles or cousins who live in our part of the country or are in touch. It’s a bit of a lonely experience. I will hope to share anything helpful I can to others who are going through a similar journey, a journey not talked about much. Cheers."

He has several “real” issues, like asthma, as well as SZA, but he is also constantly worried about getting sick, having a heart attack, an embolism, or an aneurysm, etc. However, he won’t make changes to improve his lifestyle (exercise, diet, etc) and after multiple hospital visits (and many hospital bills) I am overwhelmed. I know hypochondria is usually a form of OCD or anxiety, and so I’m wondering if this is something I should bring up with his psychiatrist. I have not approached talking with my husband about this because I know that if I bring up my concerns, even with data and notes I’ve taken, it will just feed into his paranoia loops.

I have adjusted to the new normal, but refuse to accept it. I measure progress in minute improvements now, things that people unfamiliar with this illness would find laughable. We here do not. Some research is being done into treatments for the Negative Symptoms of schizophrenia. Everyone recognizes the Positive Symptoms, but this other side often goes unaddressed. These are the symptoms that keep many from returning what most would consider a productive, fulfilling life. This illness affects not only the diagnosed person but a whole circle of people, even to the larger community that loses a vibrant, contributing member."
176267220,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! I think I got real sloppy on the mixing on this one but I genuinely think all the elements make for a nice vibe still

176267224,"Hi _PERSON_, Glad you are doing better. Good for you for getting vaccinated and keeping active. It is good that you like your new psychiatrist and your new meds. Perhaps volunteering or working somewhere would be a good change for you, my daughter became MUCH happier after she got a job again. That made me much happier. Perhaps also you should try to get on the diagnosed forum again since it’s been over a year. Did you go out with your mom for Mother’s Day?"
176267225,Tbh ? wouldnt be surprised either people are ??????? horrible
176267226,"My son was on the same path. Destruction, unsafe habits and living environment. Even after I got guardianship, it continued - UNTIL my son started on clozapine. It has been a game changer, and even tho we (the pdoc and myself) didn’t think he would stay compliant and cooperate with the lab testing schedule, he has. I credit that to the fact that it actually WORKS for him to calm the voices in his head. It took a while, but many of his positive symptoms are controlled, and he doesn’t seem so completely driven by the delusions that do remain. I think the fact that I had made the decision for him to be admitted to what is called a “level-2” facility here in my state - a locked setting with nursing and the permission to administer meds when appropriate - helped. He wanted to remain in the independent living status he had returned to, and he knew if things continued down the path he was on, he would be back in some kind of facility. BTW, the admission was made directly from a hospital stay, so h
e didn’t really have a choice to get out of it. I hope you can get thru this and see some light. My son continues to make progress. Just recently, he has openly admitted his diagnosis (I wasn’t even around, he volunteered it!) has requested to start talk therapy, and is going to try a martial arts class this week. He has a pet cat who he adores, and who he doesn’t want to traumatize with loud noises. We have started doing repairs in the house where he lives. I did, when I provided this house for him, do it with the condition that I would have access to the property. I will also so that for quite some time, I would not enter his house without keeping my phone and my keys on my person, for safety concerns. When he was still sick with active hallucinations, he sometimes objected to my entry, but I think he really appreciates it now - I come in to fix food, bring groceries (and sometimes plunge the toilet). He lives a pretty calm life now. I agree on the “no more electronics” and also just not dealing w
ith some of the repairs. I was at the same point myself a few years back. I DID replace windows when broken, but left the gaping holes in the walls. (I REEEELLY don’t enjoy repairing holes in old plaster walls!)"
176267227,So if it has been more than one year. You should be okay.
176267228,"_AT_MENTION_ you know, I just won’t take “well meaning” advice anymore from anyone who does not have an adult child with sz. I’ve become bold in telling them I don’t need their advice, but a hug might be nice."

176267230,"Hi _NAME_, Please keep in mind (as oldladyblue said) that you have no control over the situation. You have done your best, staying with him despite all the conflict and anger. I would urge you to find a therapist who specializes in mental illness and explain what happened with your boyfriend. No matter how strong some of us are, words can hurt and it sounds like his words have hurt you a lot. A properly trained therapist will be able to help you look past the pain and frustration to a better future. Of course you care about him and it is natural that you feel alone and don’t know where to go. I have been in a similar situation with my husband and am caring for an elderly relative now, so that occupies my attention. If you are still in touch with him, let him know you care about him. That is the most you can do. You need to take care of yourself."
176267231,I don’t think most people with schizophrenia are lucky enough to have caregivers. I used to work in shelters and I saw many people there with schizophrenia. The sad truth is that most can’t handle mental illness and end up having to shut them out of their lives. Care centers can help but they must have Identification. The lack of identification or the ability to hold on to such things is a common problem for those with schizophrenia.
176267232,"Hello _PERSON_, I have not posted in awhile, but would like to welcome you to this site. There are many of us here to give you support. You are not alone, we all can relate to your situation. It’s so hard to keep all of this to yourself, is there a support group in your area? I hope you say in touch here in the forum, take care, _NAME_"

176267236,"I may have been doing it all wrong the last few years. I’m guilty of babying and coddling my son most of his life. And that only worsened after his diagnosis. I was borderline smothering him. Most likely from loving him so much to feelings of guilt being behind it. Last few weeks I have taken a different approach. When I feel he’s wrong about something, I express it. When we are in disagreement, I tell him so. I also remind him no one is perfect or above reproach, and he’s not always right. I speak to him objectively and fairly, just like I do with my older son or any other human being. I was wrong to think babying him was the only possible way. But I think that was more for me and my way of trying to appease some of the guilt I was feeling. He’s responding so much better to the directness, especially when I don’t show so much mothering. Yes, I love to smother him with love, but he doesn’t like it. He’s no different than any other young man as far as being smothered by their mother. T
hey don’t like it. Just a suggestion for some moms on here. Try the fair but objective, matter of fact approach and see what happens. A little tough love. I know all we want to do is coddle them and protect them, but in my case it backfired. Just thought I’d share."

176267247,"My life is really horrible right now. My husband left me again (left for a week this past March, too), and he’s not coming back for a month — I’m so sad. He has schizophrenia, and he’s having a relapse, but he doesn’t believe it and neither does his psychiatrist He left me again, and he won’t come back from his parent’s house for a month! He’s having a relapse of schizophrenia, and he’s been lying to his psychiatrist about his symptoms and maybe not taking his meds, so she doesn’t think that he’s having a relapse and needs to be hospitalized. This is so horrible for me. I’m so depressed and sad and upset, and I cry a lot because he’s not here. I talk to my parents if I start to feel worse and keep distracted by watching TV trying to eat healthy food I have a new therapist — trying to set up a marriage therapist I’m gonna visit my aunt and see long-time friends We tried a marriage therapist before but she sided with him and didn’t let me talk much. I’m looking for a 
better one, but it will be quite the search because of our bad insurance He even started a job so we were about to have a little bit of extra money soon until he can get a better job He’s paranoid of my parents and me He said I wouldn’t find a marriage therapist, but I did yesterday after he was gone and I have a new therapist. He said that I didn’t bother to get one, but I just wanted to get a good one. it’s hard. My husband is a narcissist — more so this year, and his parents keep telling him that I’m the problem — he’s at their house now he lies to everyone, even his doctor and they believe his story — even when his symptoms increase like this. I have depression and anxiety. We were always so close and had a loving relationship until recently. I want to work really hard to have a relationship that is closer to how it used to be, but he needs to make some changes that we can work on together, and take his meds."
176267248,"for me it stopped also when i was on my current meds… but i think they don’t want to do anything to me anymore because i take their meds now… and maybe they will start again when i’m prepped enough with the current meds. I know they have a plan for me and they tried to push me before, with controlling me, in the right direction but it didn’t work so they made me like this so i would be put on the right meds that will give them more control later…"

176267250,"Appreciate the thanks! My headache was recovering nicely, but all it took was one trip to the post office to get stressed out and relapse with another headache, erasing weeks of healing. I think I need daily walks to strengthen my brain against stress, even though it feels like something’s going to burst. I’m just thinking if something’s is going to go wrong healthwisr, let it go wrong in style, not just sitting at home hiding. I’d recommend anyone that isn’t well mentally to go on daily walks, once or twice a day, for half an hour each time, to condition the brain to withstand stress, otherwise your recovery will be erased at the first exposure to mixed company. Also, I’m going to experiment with a mitochondrial antioxidant, SkQ1, that is so effective it’s being touted as a literal fountain of youth! It extends life by 10% and reduces the rate of unnatural death by around half, since it does such a good job healing and maintaining the body! It is shown to be as effective as a 1,000,0
00x dose of N-acetylcystine, and has such a strong antioxidant effect it can even reverse cataracts! It is like mutant healing factor (for those who have seen X-Men.) Rapid healing. It is in trials to be released for purchase in the US, and will be available in 2-5 years. It is already available in eyedrop form in Russia. I’m going to buy a sample from an Alibaba merchant, but the main supplier is out of stock. If it were in stock, the 10 gram minimum would last 1 person over 8 years at therapeutic levels, and only cost $300 USD shipped. So, in the coming weeks I’ll be trying out this stuff. Anything to cure my chronic headache that keeps coming back."

176267264,"The refusal of psychology is in my opinion a wrong decision, which I would like the opportunity to contest with the decision maker. I appreciate you have worked hard to try and get this sorted, but I feel we need to press harder to get this sorted out. If we cannot reach an agreement with the head of the department, then I am afraid this is sending the wrong signal. You know as well as I do that my first round was ineffective. [Name removed] did not provide the appropriate treatment, and I do not think it’s good that I am left to rot in psychological sewage when there is potential to get help down this avenue. Dr.[Name removed] informed me that I would be referred to the voices clinic, yet a month later I have not heard a thing about it - not even a waiting letter etc Secondly, I want a proper session F2F with[Name removed] for a re-evaluation of the recent diagnosis of depression. If it is indeed true, he knows I am not taking my medication for this illness. This cannot be left unchecked if I ha
ve clinical depression that requires treatment. The fact is my quality of life is being greatly reduced by my low mood, and the waves of extreme hopeless feeling that I get and have experienced more often recently. I tried to get Dr. [Name removed] to call me on Friday, as my anxiety has been playing up again. Thirdly, previously you mentioned the Haven service to me. On more than one occasion the operator on the mental health line recommended that this might be a suitable thing for me to do to take a break from all that’s going on here, right now for 72 hours. However, once I get put through to a clinician, this promise of a support to see me through the weekend is taken from me and I get angered. You said to me that you thought this service would help me when I needed it, but I am denied this also by those who’re supposed to be meeting my needs over the weekend out of hours Fourthly, my time with the employment support service - dealing with[Name removed] , ends in June. This timed intervention much lik
e the psychology is not coming at a good time. I fear that once that support is gone I am royally screwed. Right now I am concocting my exit strategy from working, and burning through my savings to support myself until the state can can take on some of the financial burden in the position I find myself in. This is obviously a massive decision to make, and I will need to be supported on this endeavour post-June. What is the solution to this event that is due to take hold? I am going to be contacting my booked customers shortly to refund their money, and drop the works planned from after June, which is after I stop seeing[Name removed] (On the phone of course) Who will ensure that the UC50 is filled out well enough for me to qualify for the support as [Name removed] kindly organised with her colleague _PERSON_? Fifth, I was promised that I would be getting lists of help for trying to help me with the pitfalls of having Autism. Dr.[Name removed] , and yourself have promised me lists of support available that are 
up to date? [Name removed] told me after the diagnosis was made that her techniques would not work on me, and[Name removed] was supposed to attend my doctor appointment to hand over the diagnosis to Dr. [Name removed]and ensure it was treated in some way. I feel the service has rightly diagnosed me with this condition, however the issue still remains that I am socially inept, and this is having a significant impact on my functioning as I am trying to be a part of the community, but now I know why this is so hard. The original list I was sent to organise my own support in the third sector was not appropriate or fit for purpose. One place for example told me their waiting list was too long and refused to even put me on it Sixth, the lack of medical help with my medications is wholly frustrating. These meds come with significant side effects, and part of my refusal process for the anti-depressant was due to the side effect profile of Mitrazapine, but no follow up on any meds other than being put on a six monthly 
pdoc review is conducted. How am I expected to just blindly take these meds without proper monitoring? For example, I was left by my GP on Olnazapine for two years, and I went from 59 kilos to 96 kilos in that time. Dr. [Name removed] worked extremely hard to rectify this, but of course he’s not here anymore. Dr. [Name removed] is a brilliant and caring doctor, but I feel the undue pressure put on the NHS staff means they just don’t have the time to put in the time required. I am not going to elaborate further, as this has already turned into a long email. Basically, I expect this to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. The Trust - and I say the Trust as the overarching organisation - has until the end of June to make some progress. If there is no progress, I expect to be discharged from services - taking immediate effect. We get to this end date, I am making it abundantly clear to you right now that I do not require the assistance of the Trust. What has become apparent is that I am now probably what y
ou term as a long term service user, which I find wholly unacceptable to be in this position when treatment options are being exhausted after just one attempt. My patience is wearing incredibly thin right now, hence this email I am sending to you now. Basically if you take one thing from this, it’s if you can no longer offer the required treatments because we tried and failed, and I am a waste of time, resource and effort, I’d rather just deal with my ??????? GP that by the way, still deals with me despite me asking you to remove her from my case. If we get to the end of June - which I think is a reasonable deadline, we will have to work on an exit strategy together, as I am not prepared to be treated like a stone in someones shoe that won’t go away"

176267286,HI _NAME_ thanks i think if she has made her decision there is little anyone can do
176267287,A week ago my son left saying he was going to a city nearby. He has often gone on weekend trips and come back with no problem. I have not spoken to him since June 7th. There is no activity on his debit/credit cards since Saturday. He is psz and the manic episodes have been longer in duration. I am afraid for him. I have notified the police in the city he was last in. They were very helpful in taking the information. I don’t know if I have lost him or not. He is 29 years old. Above average IQ. Very tech savvy. His phone goes to voicemail every time I try.
176267288,Hi. My son is 29. He has been schizophrenic since he was 17. He was on Respirdol for many years and about six years ago was changed to Haldol. He takes it daily and gets a monthly shot also. He has done very well on Haldol.
176267289,_AT_MENTION_ I hope you find something that will work for your son. Hopefully the right medicine can be found to help with his psychosis.
176267290,Also from Western Washington.

176267293,"Another trick I learned about effective role play from multiple therapists (my present psychiatrist mentioned this too) is you should play the role of your son rather than yourself and mirror your idea of his responses. This way the person coaching you gets information about your perception and projections onto the person, gets objective context and can better model effective responses and introspection. Notice that Dr. _PERSON_ in his TEDx talk takes a similar approach in his role play. He instructs people how to play the patients which has added effect of putting themselves in their places as well as coaching them on better following his directions and practice objectivity. A pair of peers could also swap back and forth, each playing each other’s charges with supervision."
176267294,"Update: Unfortunately things have taken a turn for the worst and I had to have my son involuntarily committed this morning. This is the 3rd hospital visit in 3 months. My heart is breaking and for the first time in a very, very long time I feel hopeless. He really needs to go to the state hospital for long term treatment and they have a waiting list. I can’t manage him any longer and that’s tearing me up inside too. So please pray that the local hospital will be able to transfer him directly to the state hospital so he can get the care he needs. Thanks."
176267295,Thankyou _AT_MENTION_
176267296,"Hope, He has been on the same medication for nearly a year and it is not working. I have told hospitals, case workers…you name it, I told them and it didn’t make a damn bit of difference. In terms of documentation, all I have to do is count every six months because that is about how long it is between hospital stays and a few times, less than that. Because of HIPPA laws, there is not much I can do in terms of talking to his doctors. As I wrote in my first post, I spoke to his counselor last week and told him what was going on, as to whether he has done anything to help my husband, I do not know. He just listened to me and told me he could not comment to me about my husbands condition…I reminded him that he didn’t need to as I have lived with him for the last six years and there is nothing he can tell me that I don’t already know (but I did say it nicely to reassure him that I understood what he was saying but also to let him know I know more about my husbands condition than anyone else). 
My guy would never agree to guardianship or payee, so that is out of the question. He has a gift of putting on quite a show for the people that matter such as doctors, counselors, etc. to the point that I sometimes wonder if they think I am lying to them about his mental state. I told the psychiatric team who came to my house (at my call) three months ago that he was being aggressive towards me and that he “shoulder checked” me and other things delusional related…they came in the house asked him a few questions, he answered them perfectly and they left without him. Even after what I told them…really? They were convinced that he was taking his meds, which he was, and that he was fine. I told them his meds weren’t working…it didn’t matter. He has become an ace at fooling them and it is really hurting him because if they would have taken him the first time I called 3 months ago, I’m not sure he would be in this situation right now and things probably wouldn’t have gotten that bad to where I had 
to get a restraining order against him."

176267298,There are ways to deal with those types of people. Get a sound machine and turn it high when they are around. It’s better to hear the ocean or water running than an overly talkative person. Telling them to shut up never works and in many cases they can’t help but continuously talk. So let them talk all they darn well please and enjoy the ocean.

176267309,"As a recap followed by an update, my husband tapered off Abilify a year ago due to side effects, did well for a couple of months, and then got paranoid and delusional about 9 months ago. He wasn’t wanting medication (of course) and his psychiatrist backed way off (for a bit too long, IMHO), so he’s been mostly isolated in the house since early summer - attending his psychiatry appointments but with nothing actually happening, which has been frustrating for both of us. My husband’s family finally started taking things seriously (they had to actually start seeing his symptoms before they’d take me seriously). And with them on board, we got my husband to request medication at his appointment yesterday. He was prescribed Vraylar - he’d responded well to Abilify before developing EPS and this med is similar (Reluxi is next in line to try, I guess, if the Vraylar doesn’t work). Anyway, my husband was pretty unhappy (of course) with his psychiatrist and me, too (whenever he is unhappy or stres
sed, he gets paranoid about me, lucky me) as he wanted to continue on his own and without medication. However, with the encouragement of his family and myself, he did take the first dose last night. Interestingly, everyone involved (including my husband!) seems hopeful right now with the exception of myself. I guess no one else really experienced everything it took to get my husband stable the first time - my husband has very few memories from that period of time and his family and doctor have no idea how much work/effort from me it took to get him to take the medications, stay on the medications, keep up healthy habits etc. etc. I would love to be feeling hopeful as well. And perhaps I will at some point. But right now, I am just feeling numb. I don’t feel like I can share this reaction elsewhere, but I imagine there are others here who can understand. Thanks to everyone here for the support and the place to vent. I feel so grateful to have found this community."
176267310,"We were able to get our son to see a psychiatrist by using Dr _PERSON_’s LEAP methods. Once communication lines were reopened, we found out he wanted to vacation in Colorado. We offered to pay for a trip to Colorado for him if he would see a psychiatrist regularly for one year. There is another book with ideas about how to work the ultimatum process. “You Need Help” By Mark _PERSON_. We used this book after our son completed the year required to get the Colorado trip. We were not successful but other people say it worked for them."
176267311,"In my experience the more you engage this kind of behavior the worse it will get. Even if you think you can put up with it, later you may regret what might have been had you made a different decision. I mean missed opportunities for personal growth and healing that may lead to healthier relationships or just the feeling of being safe from abuse (I say just but that’s pretty huge.) I know sometimes we might feel like if we love someone no matter how they act or what they do, they will do the same for us and that is in itself its own feeling of safety and security. Again, in my experience, it’s worth the trouble to make different choices despite how hard it is at first because you know you are worth it."

176267313,_AT_MENTION_ How is your sister doing? Hoping for the best for you all.
176267314,I am really interested in the genetic testing you did. I have read that folic acid deficiency can lead to psychosis and what appears to be schizophrenia. Our son was on abilify and it made him so much worse. He had his initial psychosis at 18 from drug abuse and smoking THC heavily. He responded well to Olanzapine stayed free of psychosis until he got off his meds and started getting high again. It sounds like if you daughter came out of a psychosis on her own without medicine within a week - she probably is not schizophrenic. Maybe she had some type of toxicity in her system? Did she use drugs and do you know for sure? Even taking Adderral can cause it. Ive seen patients with UTI or coming out of anesthesia or from drug use come out of psychosis on their own within days. Typically they are not schizophrenic.
176267315,"I’d be anxious and nervous, too. My sister and 1.5 year old nephew are visiting from _NAME_ (I live in Ohio), and my nephew has been a blast to be with. He’s so cute lol. I’m sure you’ll be a great momma."

176267322,"I also became a worse version of myself. My friends say that I am slower since I am on meds. Also I lack motivation. But we have to tell ourselves that it is for our own good. otherwise we would be hearing voices, hallucinations, depression… maybe there is another med you can try ? what does your psy doc say about that ?"
176267323,Good auto detailing isn’t cheap. Cheers to you for taking care of your whip.
176267324,I sound so crazy don’t I. I have really branched out on what I believe they are doing. I used to believ it was only me
176267325,I am also sad. My son diagnosed 7 years ago and is also an alcoholic. 3 weeks ago he stopped speaking to me and his sister. I worry- but know he doesn’t s showing up for his job regularly. He lives in an apartment I bought after living with us for 6 years. He is supposed to pay me rent and cable every month. When I stopped speaking to me he stopped paying. This is new behavior. I hope he makes good choices. I am praying all day everyday.
176267326,I have it did and I’ve used it. It’s okay. No guarantees though
176267327,"I told the docs I was tired all the time. They kept saying, “I dunno”. Finally, one doctor told me, “Well, you take enough meds to sedate a horse.” They told me I was taking so much medication because I smoked. Therefore, when I stopped smoking, I thought the dosages would go down. I stopped smoking six plus years ago. I still take the same amount of meds, however. Fatigue is still a problem. The doctors suck. Would I rather go to a witchdoctor? I don’t think so."

176267335,I take you seriously!
176267336,"I think bringing God into things too soon confuses matters. I’m not trying to knock religion, but when you are psychotic and hearing voices and/or having delusions, you can get confused and misinterpret religious teachings or scripture and in the wrong state of mind it can be dangerous. Who’s to say the voices you hear aren’t God or the Devil or both. Or that somehow everyday events have religious significance, or your hallucinations or delusions are prophetic. Or that you should stop taking medication, because God will heal you. I know a case where a patient harmed himself to test God, saying that Jesus would heal him because of his faith. Without getting into details, the results were catastrophic. I urge great caution with religion. It doesn’t mix well with hallucinations or resulting delusions. Finding your way back to reality from even mild psychosis requires questioning many things in life that many well people take for granted. That’s why they stress listening and empathizing. When 
you don’t know what’s going on internally with someone, you may inadvertently trigger or destabilize them. _USER_ID_: I’ll add in postscript if it isn’t clear, that many things that happen when you are psychotic are strange and seem unexplainable—like a waking dream. And your mind makes up stories to try and explain them— that’s the source of delusions. So thoughts that you are pursued by the FBI or CIA or the Illuminati or the Knights Templar or aliens from another planet all seem equally plausible explanations, and depending on the content of your hallucinations, you may pick one of these supernatural or conspiratorial explanations."

I explained to my husband it was from Black Panther and a friend pointed out _PERSON_ West was saying that is how he would run the country. Flash forward we saw what _PERSON_ intagram post. Explains a lot! I actually saw some people who responded to her post saying _PERSON_ needs to take responsibility for his behavior. They just don’t get it. He does seem to have a small bit of insight though. At least he was able to discuss it on _PERSON_. I’ve never been into watching the _PERSON_, but _PERSON_ has gained a whole new level of respect from me. I will definitely message her my support. It would be great if she would join forces with the likes of _PERSON_."
176267342,"I dont really think I need to cite my source because it’s common knowledge, even my psych said about 20 years. She said that because of the suicide rate of people with skitzo my point was invalid. But I can again testify that I felt like a slave being forced on all of that shit most of my life, knowingly taking something that makes me depressed and suicidal, manic, or actually caused psychosis for me. I’m still doing fine, actually I feel better now than I did when I wrote my response originally. Being in the mental health system feels like being a lab rat for a psuedo science cult. I’m not saying that people who are having horrifying delusions and crazy shit like that dont need some kind of therapy and possible medication, but there are many cases like my own where the docters are actually making these people sick. When you try to refute their logic, they talk to you like you have no idea where you are or what’s going on and litterally try to brain wash you into accepting their world view. 
Well, I’ve ONLY experienced delusions, manic/depressive episodes and psychotic depression on medication, or while withdrawing from it. Now that I’m on the other side of the tunnel it feels strange not feeling like a complete emotional disaster and not feeling like I could crawl out of my skin. Psychology>psychiatry."

176267344,"The problem is that the olanzapine has occupied a lot of your brainreceptors for a X amount of time, and now the body’s natural system, like the natural hormones and substances that are supposed to occupy those receptors don’t work on them because they have the brain is accustomed to the olanzapine. If you are lucky it only takes a few months to get rid of the insomnia, but it could take over a year. You could try to kickstart your system with things like tryptophan, 5-htp and GABA. But the problem is all of those probably interacts badly with all antipsychotics. So you might not be able to use it because of your other AP. At least you would have to be very careful and only take small doses."

176267346,"_AT_MENTION_. Right. I would hope that when a psychiatrist prescribes these drugs they do all they can to inform the patient of those three: tests for high blood pressure and blood glucose and lipid levels , meds (blood pressure and metformin for weight and blood sugar), diet and exercise. That has to go along with prescribing the drugs. A simple thing to do would be to give the patient written instructions."

176267352,"Hello Everyone, My mom has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia since before I was born. She was, mostly stable, on old school Thorazine and usually antidepressant/mood stabilizer. Around three years ago, her long term psychiatrist died and it has been hell since then. She experienced a slight mental break overseas in 2017 and I had to fly over to get her. When I brought her back, she voluntarily checked herself into the hospital and they stabilized her on 1.5mg of risperdal and a mood stabalizer. Unfortunately, I didn’t fully engage with her care and after linking her to a psychiatrist, I was hands off. Fast forward to fall of 2019 and she is once again experiencing a full psychotic break overseas. Somehow I got her back to the states again and had her involuntarily committed(I found out she was not taking her meds for over a year). Unfortunately this time, the medication(2mg risperdal then 4mg risperdal) was not working. Her delusions and aggressive behaviors would not stabilize. She stay
ed in the hospital until February and was released on the condition of attending groups. The groups did not go well and she was eventually discharged in March right before covid hit. Fast forward to July, and her condition was rapidly getting worse. I had to fight with her to take her medication and then I realized she wasn’t really taking them. It was a mess. I had her involuntarily committed again until late August. She was released with the IOC program and was started on the invega shot, daily risperdal, plus tripital(mood stabilizer). The mood stabilizer was the godsend medication. She is finally not aggressive, but unfortunately; her psychosis is still very active. She thinks I’m a clone and not her real son,etc. I don’t believe the risperdal does anything for her anymore, and she just received her second invega shot. The doctor wants the invega to work since there is a three month version of the drug. At this point, I just miss my mom and wish she was back to reality. Her mood is better because of 
the mood stabilizer but her psychosis is still very active. Any advice on medication?"

Let yourself feel what you feel, whether anger, grief or fear. And if your son continues to do well, you’ll slowly begin to feel better as well.

176267384,"Not sure what you mean about “impossible to get off of”, there are several diagnosed people on this forum who have used Olanzapine (Zyprexa) and are off it now and on other drugs— myself included. Can you cite a source for what you read? Olanzapine is notorious for causing weight gain, so doctors, patients and caregivers alike tend to be interested in alternatives, and there are many and new drugs come out periodically as patents expire. There’s some literature that antipsychotics in general are hard to stop once you start, but I don’t know anything particularly special about Olanzapine. Generally once someone is diagnosed with a psychotic disorder they tend to take some form antipsychotic medication indefinitely as they do not cure the illnesses. Think of AP medication as you might insulin for a diabetic in this his case. Since you are in the UK Clozapine is an option if he becomes resistant to Olanzapine. It is often an effective drug of last resort in the states because it has rare ser
ious side effects that require frequent blood testing. It is more commonly used in the UK/EU."
176267385,"I live now in Leuven, Belgium. I came back after my first psychosis from NY to Brussels and when I went on disability I moved back to my hometown Leuven."
176267386,"My case of schizophrenia was pretty severe in the first couple years. My first year after being diagnosed I spent in a group home. I was 19-20 years old. I had no friends, no money, no job, no car, certainly no girlfriend, very little sanity, no school. And I suffered terribly, every minute of every day. I spent months sitting in an old dirty chair out back by myself fighting for my sanity. After a year there, I was put in the hospital. Pretty much the same as the group home but now I was locked up with 75 other maniacs. I got put on medication for the first time and it didn’t make me better but it stopped me from getting worse. Spent 8 months in that place. I got released to a nice group home this time. I was still severely ill but somehow the combination of being in a nice environment with plenty of structure got me fairly stable. In the first group home and the hospital things looked pretty hopeless. I saw no future. I was suicidal often. But in this new group homes I improved in tiny incremen
ts and after 9 months I got a job. I stayed at that job four years, through thick and thin, through psychosis and depression and through a lot of other crap life threw me. Now I’m 60 years old. I’m looking back on working almost steadily, albeit mostly part time, for almost the last 40 years. I still take one online class at a time. I am just finishing up my degree for my own satisfaction, I have three more classes to go. I lived independently for 20 years. I’ve been driving my own cars since 1997. I take care of myself and manage to have fun sometimes. I won’t lie, life gets tough sometimes. It’s tough but I still fool around and play my little games like everyone else, it’s not all serious and life and death. I just wanted to give my story to give you a little hope and show you what is possible. You may not work for 38 years but you could certainly work 5 years maybe, or even ten. One thing I observed in 40 years of adulthood is that almost everybody has potential, you may not see it in yourself 
but others might see it in you. I was severely, severely ill and I got better. Other people, including you, have that chance too. Don’t give up. Most people suffer at the beginning of their disease but most people get better. Recovery is a reality. We all deserve a chance and there’s people out there who want to help.

176267396,I understand that since before this she has had a drug addiction and that was a long winding road to get her treated. Although I feel this is different than one being strung out because rehab helped her overcome her drug addiction. This I feel is far more complex than getting help over an addiction. This is her reality. She firmly believes in her delusions. And I now know trying to reason with her will only push her away. Thank you for your response.

176267406,With medication and rational thinking. People are preoccupied with their own problems. There is no possibility that I’m being monitored. Even if I was my life is so boring that it isn’t an interest for others. I’m not that important of a person.

176267408,It is very hard when you watch your children do the same thing over and over and get hurt over and over. It is ok to tell her you will always provide food (not money) so she can eat and shelter on a short term basis and let her figure every thing else out. Can you contact your local United Way for referral to a woman’s shelter and legal aid? Perhaps obtain guardianship and place her in a home? My heart breaks for your. Hang in there. You are a good mom.

176267410,My best suggestion is to take a _USER_ID_ Family to Family class if there is one in your area. National Alliance on Mental Illness also has Family support groups. I have seen siblings in both the class and the support groups. Both are provided at no cost to those attending. Is there _USER_ID_ in your area?
176267411,"I usually go to the VA hospital for treatment Wich is very good, your treated with respect and the food is good, it’s just boring because theirs not much to do. I’ve been to the state hospital twice, spent about a year in treatment, it sucked, people sreaming all the time also getting violent. The only good thing is that you got to go outside and go for a walk by yourself if you had passes. We also had something called the _NAME_ treatment mall _PERSON_ is were we had group’s."
176267412,"i order them from amazon, bol.com and mediamarkt… but most from amazon, on amazon they are the cheapest."
176267413,"I have had terrible anxiety since I was 16. A lot of what I am going to say mirrors the solution of CBT and therapy with the added solution of making positive changes having personal goals, self-care, and daily exercise. The cause of my anxiety was my failure to act to make changes and implement daily self-care. My anxiety was screaming at me daily to start doing something valuable with my time. I let myself become 250 lbs and I spent most of my days playing video games. I was able to achieve whatever I wanted in the video games, but until I realized I could achieve any reasonable goal in real life, nothing could change for me. Negative symptoms, namely lack of motivation, are a hinderance, but the limitations are not as defined as you might think. I realized that it was far more painful to go on not improving myself and my habits than to actually start doing good things for myself. Daily exercise is the gateway to all the other good changes you can make. Start small with 15-20 minutes of exercise 
a day walking or other light exercise just building a habit of physically getting to the gym and doing some activity. Before you know it you will be pushing yourself to do more intense exercise for longer. I started this way a couple weeks ago, and recently I was able to walk 3 miles, and if you exercise daily, this will lead to daily showers because you are going to sweat. I used to never shower because of the negative symptoms. It is a two-for-one because you basically have to shower after doing exercise. Make some goals and use the myfitnesspal app to count calories if you want to lose weight. Hold yourself to the commitment to log your foods and do some form of exercise starting with light exercise until it becomes a habit. Just get yourself to the gym. Don’t commit to strenuous exercise yet. Take a rest day if you need to, but don’t let it turn into breaking of the habit. The feeling that you have achieved something for yourself during the day helped me deal with my anxiety. Being addicted to my pain
, my anxiety turned to different topics after this, but this is where talking to a therapist and family can help and you should ask for their advice and get things off your mind. Work on your new mindset by forgiving yourself and others through your thoughts often. List every single thing you are greatful for in life. Try praying to a higher power and believe the changes you ask for will be made and this will give you confidence to actualize positive changes. Be your own hero in life. You are the protagonist. Your darkest experiences can break you or they can lead you into clear blue skies. You have to make the positive commitments to yourself. You have to try to create better thought patterns. After doing daily exercise for a while, you will think about what else you can do for yourself like brushing your teeth twice a day, daily meditation, yoga (yoga with adriene on youtube is GREAT for self-care and balancing your body where stress is stored) reading books, listening to audio books or learning through you
tube videos, practicing skills, finding a creative outlet, etc. The world is yours to master. Don’t let anxiety win. Make positive changes in habits, and I really suggest daily exercise. One will lead to another and you can be the hero. Don’t chase after fleeting pleasures too much, but allow yourself some of these in moderation. Seek lasting pleasures of goals realized. Work on yourself and your mental state. Refine your negative beliefs by seeking answers and new information. Make your life about self improvement, self-acceptance and self-care and helping others is key. Explore your spiritual side. This is my advice. _PERSON_ (Skatchatoon)"

176267416,"I think it depends on the person. I wouldn’t rub it in his face but start with sharing small things and find other ways to include him. I understand you wanting to bring God into his life, but your time would be better spent helping him gain recovery, and THEN sharing faith when his mind is functioning more normally. Faith frequently plays a part in delusions of persons with SZ."

176267431,"_PERSON_, I’ve read your message about your son. I’m sorry you are in such a difficult situation. We went through this several years ago with our daughter. Also I read the responses people have made. I definitely have found LEAP formula and Dr. _PERSON_’s book helpful. Another book that may help you at this stage is Surviving Schizophrenia by _PERSON_. It gives you an idea what the illness is like and suggestions what to do. Also connect with your local _USER_ID_ group for support for yourself. They have wonderful people there from our experience who help you and also your son if you can get him to talk with an advocate. One of the biggest things is the your son needs you and your family as hard as it is. Is your son’s housemate helpful in supporting him and getting help? We did do Wellness checks on our daughter. They can evaluate if the person is harmful to themselves or others. They would only take them in if either of these were taking place. Be aware as your son is an adult and he has 
rights that even we as parents can’t interfere when in the care of a therapist or psychiatrist unless they sign a release. HIPPA laws are quite strict but you can always share with them your thoughts and insights. Your feelings are normal but so so hard. Remember to take care of yourself and you will have to learn what that means."

I spoke to _NAME_ about this over a week ago, very calmly, and he was ok with it since he believes our neighbors want to hurt him and me. I have been trying to keep it together for both of our sakes but im falling apart. He hasn’t been doing well for months and has been getting worse.

After the last episode, in early 2018, he came home under the condition that he take his medication and not do drugs. He knows I will evict him if he does not comply; I have in the past (therapy helped with this). Since he’s been home it’s been a long road recovering from the episode, but he’s steadily improved. He’s 26 now, participates in household activities, laughs at funny videos, discusses the election, cooks dinner once in a while. Welcome home, bud."
176267447,"Sorry to hear about your son, in the long term I don’t think you should put your trust is psychiatric services. The medication may be of help but that’s because they are drugging him, not because they are treating an underlying illness. Its the same logic as lobotomy. Before the treatment patients were highly agitated suffering from crippling mental illness however after the lobotomy they were quiet, uncomplaining and showed little concern for their troubles. Patients wrote letters to _NAME_ thanking him. I’ve also had a history of severe mental illness but managed to get better and no longer take any medication, work part time 2 jobs and actually enjoy my life with my girlfriend and look forward to the future.

She was crying tonight for no apparent reason. She does that sometimes. She’s probably going to have to have someone to take care of her the rest of her life just because of the way she is. She has very limited verbal skills and doesn’t understand a lot of the concepts you and I take for granted. Like she doesn’t understand the concept of money , for example. So I can’t imagine her ever being capable of holding a job or living on her own. Her mother(my sister) died about 10 years ago of cancer. I can’t think of anything else to say.

176267459,"I’ll be here to talk to! I have to recommend that you make time for a therapy sesh. They are done from zoom now so you can be comfy at home with your pup when you attend. I’ve used therapy for my own depression years ago and i an forever grateful for what it did for me. I just signed up for a session (coming up this week). It’s nice to get things off your chest without feeling like a burden and a good therapist helps you work through with the hard stuff that lingers behind your conscious and come across new perspectives that open up a world of freedom when you are feeling like you’re stuck with no place to turn anymore. Some workplaces also cover free sessions for the worker and also their family so you should research if that applies to anyone in your household (mine is called EAP). Therapy, and other self care like yoga, workouts, meditation, hiking, massages, and getting out in nature all help give me a sense of control over my own wellbeing and make it easier to not be affected by circu
mstances out of my control. Also, have your parents tried talking to your sisters doctor or a social worker about her aggression? Have you talked to reach other about how you feel dealing with it? I am still learning a lot about SZ and treatments but if she has anger and it is creating fear in you and your family then she may need more help/different treatment than she is receiving to get things in order. I’m sorry that you are putting off things in your life bc you want to be there to keep your family safe. That is a very loving thing to do and I’m rooting for all of you. Hope you are having a good day and do something nice for yourself this weekend. You deserve it!!"

The mother is in Canada, the kids were supposedly born there. He is in Austria. It is easy for me to file that form, for him it would be very difficult. So, I can decide to help him or not.

176267464,Hi all! I haven’t been here in a few weeks because things have been great with our son and I took this as an opportunity to take a break from all things schizophrenia for a while. He received his first haldol injection in March and was on 15 mg orally to build the medication in his system. His doctor said it was ok to wean off the pills so we did and he seemed okay. He’s been completely off of them for 7 days and last night he asked to take them because he felt like “his old way of thinking” was coming back and complained of noises from cars bothering him again. How many of you have loved ones that are on an injection also need it orally? Is this common? It’s disappointing if he ends up needing to stay on the pills but so thankful he had the wherewithal to let me know something was going on!

176267472,"I personally think, _AT_MENTION_, that the person you spoke to on the _USER_ID_ line gave you an awfully negative harmful opinion. _USER_ID_ is supposed to help provide hope, not squash it. Recovery is defined as: 1) a return to a normal state of mind, health, or strength. 2) the action or process of regaining possession or control of something stolen or lost. Recovery IS possible after a psychosis. It is NOT necessarily a full return of the state that used to exist pre-psychosis, but life can go on with a partial or full return to reality. My daughter is in recovery and has been for 10 months now, after 2.5 years of almost 24/7 psychosis (hallucinations and delusions). She is not the same person as she was before her illness started, but she is a good person to know now: working, loving, caring, etc… almost 24/7 there is no psychosis at all. Occasional voices still intrude late at night when she is alone. You must keep hoping and you must believe recovery is possible. Otherwise it is like giving 
up."
176267473,"Bottom line - your son is an adult and you are not financially responsible for any of his debts. Going forward, making sure he gets the medical care he needs even though it may be through Medical only because he doesn’t have the means to pay for care. No matter what they tell you, they cannot come after you personally for his debts. Is he receiving SSI? If not, I would work on getting him SSI and do auto pay for his insurance. My son ha schizoeffective disorder a double wammy. We are doing great using Humana for his costly meds. It has been awhile since he has been living with me, but he racked up debt, smashed a bunch of cars, DUI expenses etc. I believe I wrote a letter to all he owed any money to and the department wanting him to pay the DUI expenses, the letter included a statement from the doctor stating he was gravely ill and incapable of caring for himself.

The property is on the verge of needing to be condemned due to damage cause by my aunt and she has neighbors who are constantly trying to get her evicted. My initial plan is to try and make the property habitable and be more firm to discourage damages to the property and it’s assets. Unfortunately, she has grown accustomed to my grandma’s way of dealing with things which has been quite absent and enabling for her more manipulative behaviors. For context, she asked for a new air conditioner and, when she was told no, she broke the air conditioner and it was replace by my grandmother with no regard for her own accountabil
ity as an independently living adult under a tenant agreement. The likelihood that she will be allowed to live independently much longer is very low and I am worried. In the case that she is no longer able to live there I have nowhere for her to go. She has been evicted from every live-in program for mental illness in my area for being too sever and the local crisis center says she is not sever enough, which in Nebraska means she isn’t currently harming someone or herself. The big questions: Where do you find resources on housing for those with severe mental illness? How does that work across state lines if she is living off of government assistance? (There are no facilities in NE) Any tips/resources on making a house more safe/sabotage proof? (essentially baby proofing for SZ)"

176267483,I talk to my doctor tomorrow afternoon. I feel a bit depressed still. It’s creeping in. I also feel often that people are talking behind my back. I had a shower tonight and it was hard to do. I thought again my hair wasn’t clean and shampooed it five times. Wasted so much water and shampoo. I feel the OCD stuff just below the surface waiting to come through. Standing on the floor a couple times I felt like I was sinking into it. It’s a weird feeling. So I’ll tell my doctor all this tomorrow when I talk to him. Idk what he can do about it since he doesn’t want to put me on an SSRI again. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

My son is my qualifier- and he is not in his right space right now. When he says mean things I leave the space. I can’t love him more than he loves him- and that makes me sad- for both of us.

176267492,"Not always, there have been times I’ve flirted with not taking medication. If _PERSON_’ memoir The Center Cannot Hold is typical, I think a healthy portion of ‘high functioning’ people with SZ attempt or experiment with this. In my experience psychologists and psychiatrists can’t tell or don’t question if you are medicated as long as you seem stable and continue to come to sessions. In my case it always seemed to catch up with me one way or another and I would resume medication. I’ve never relapsed to the point that I require hospitalization since my first visit, my coping mechanisms, symptom masking and self monitoring are pretty good. I’ve been through 5 different AP medications and aside from one time when my dosage was decreased after a year or so on my first typical AP medication, dosages tend to either go up or stay the same. My dosages tend to the lower end of the scale, and nowadays the ACA mandates that AP medications are ‘free’ for my insurance. My present medication h
as few side effects at my current dosage, so taking it seems cheap (or free) insurance. My take on desires to go off medications for high functioning folks with SZ boils down to a grab bag of motivations: side effects, inconvenience or cost; ego as in, I’m better, smarter, etc than my disease so I should be able to get by without it and can self monitor and start to take it if necessary, and maybe I was misdiagnosed or have spontaneously recovered (there’s observations of this effect in some studies). I think regardless of your coping abilities, taking meds is cheap insurance. The benefits far out way the costs."
176267493,"So, yesterday was my 1st post and I wrote about how my husband was refusing meds, even tho his schizophrenia is getting worse by the day (he’s now getting violent and angry). I finally talked him into making his psych appt just to talk to the dr. AFter about 10 mins, he actually asked the dr what she recommended. Wow. After telling me under NO circumstance was he going to take any meds. He was on Seroquel already and it wasnt working (at this point it was only helping him sleep). The psych jumped on it and quickly recommended Depakote 250mg 2x a day for 4 days then 3x a day. We both asked some ?'s about it and then they talked a little and I spoke my concerns about his illness and I also brought up my research on the vitamins stuff to use in conjunction with meds. She agreed with at least 1, an amino acid called N-Acetyl cysteine. While it’s over the counter, u can’t just get it at any store. She faxed something to a compounding pharmacy and they will give us a call to ask some ?'s and get it 
ready for us. Unsure the price, as since it’s not an RX, his insurance won’t pay for it. I’m guessing it’s probly $$. She said they’ve noticed a boost in anti psycotics with this specific vitamin. Also some Omega 3’s aren’t a waste of time. They hafta to be HUGE doses and good quality. If they taste fishy, toss them. U hafta to take at least 3,000 mg a day. GOing to do some research on those today also. Anything that will make even a little difference will be a great thing. Anyway, I just wanted to let those who read and commented on my post that hubs said he did it for me. _USER_ID_ who he did it for as long as he did it. I just hope it helps, as I don’t think he’s going to try different meds to see which one works the best. I think if it doesn’t work, he’s going to give up and say “see, meds don’t work for me”. In fact, I know thats what he’ll do. I’m glad to have found this website. Reading others stories that are similar to mine makes me feel less alone. I’ll letcha all k

176267496,_AT_MENTION_ Getting him on a monthly injection is the key. I never in a million years thought my son would agree to it but he did and it has been a life saver for him. He is on his second injection (haldol) and we saw improvement very quickly and he was able to gain insight into what has been happening with him. I do worry about him continuing to get it each month because it does cause him to be EXTREMELY tired and have very low energy which he really hates but I am hoping that the longer he is on it that will eventually subside.
176267497,"I’m diagnosed with SZA and at one point in a depressive period took an SSRI and an AP. I didn’t find it particularly helpful in my case, but it was at my Psychiatrist’s direction, I did not ask for it. In the end I think the depression was a combination of work-related situation issues, and changing to one of the early atypical AP medications. Part of my motivation for the switch was I was concerned that I’d plateaued in my recovery and it would limit me in my work environment. I found my way out of the depression by changes in my work environment and a return (at the time) to typical AP medication. Some AP medications are used as adjunct therapy for antidepressants, and various AP medications are used in bipolar disorder patients seemily as adjunct mood stabilizers. My father is presently prescribed an AP and an SSRI for psychiatric issues related to dementia, so I’m fairly certain combination therapy is mainstream where indicated. I’ve seen concerns by some advocates that combination 
therapies can cause neurotransmitter sensitivities and rebounds, but I haven’t experienced this first-hand. I’m a bit skeptical that these effects are widespread, and may be a result of _NAME_-picking information of studies, but by the same token some people are genetically sensitive to certain AP medication, because they metabolize them differently. But to answer your question, yes this is a “thing” that I have experience with, but I feel only a Psychiatrist or Psychopharmacologist can say if it’s appropriate care for your situation."

176267504,"I found out today from the attorney who is drawing up my will that I will be able to leave my house and my car to my son who currently receives SSI, and it will NOT affect his monthly SSI amount. Apparently 1 house for him to live in and 1 car will not hurt his benefits. One of the conditions is that he MUST reside in the home. He can’t sell the house, and keep the cash, that would negate his SSI benefits. This is great news to me because I could not imagine him in his current apartment for long term, because they keep raising the rent yearly. And he doesn’t get much SSI as it is, so he would need to find something cheaper, and I didn’t want that to be a way of life for him, constantly moving around. Luckily, I have a very tiny newer 2 Bedroom house with minimal maintenance required, and it’s paid off. I was worried about leaving that to him, and how it would affect his SSI. Also started a notebook detailing all of the instructions, resources, for such things as utility bills, auto insuranc
e, property taxes and when they are due, where to find movers, where to find people who can fix things, the best places to buy appliances such as a refrigerator, washer, dryer, microwave, etc. things we all need in everyday life. Feeling incredibly sad as I’m starting my “notebook”, but it must be done, I think something like this would be very helpful for the people you leave behind, whether they have sz or not. I wish someone would have done it for me. A separate trust will be incorporated into the will for “extra” cash as needed, whether it be weekly or monthly. My older son will be the trustee. It’s such a huge relief for me to know he won’t ever have to worry about moving because of an increase in rent. And since the house is paid off, his monthly expenses will be very minimal, a lot cheaper than what he is currently paying for rent."

176267526,"First my condolences on your losses. I don’t mean any disrespect, but did you approach your mother and ask her input on what do with your father, her husband’s, ashes? Did it or would it hold any significant weight in the discussion? Despite their estrangement, she likely knew him longer than any of you and you wouldn’t exist without their relationship. I’m uncomfortable with you saying your mother ‘stole’ his ashes as if any of you ‘owned’ them. I think this speaks more to the importance of having a will to codify these decisions to avoid these sort of conflicts, and that these things happen with or without mental illness in the mix. What she did was deprive you of something that you hadn’t yet spent the time to consider, a missed opportunity that none of you can get back. This is the fabric of families, of weddings and baby showers, and birthdays and holidays that everyone wants to be perfect and agonize over tiny details, but they never truly live up to expectations. I went thr
ough this with my Uncle’s memorial which he tasked to me because he was childless, and I was going through issues and delusions at the time, so I got some help from the rest of the family. Even with fairly explicit instructions there were still hiccups and things that might have gone better. I felt I’d let him and the rest of the family down, but they never mention it. We did the best we could. To forgive someone is to say they aren’t perfect, and we aren’t perfect for expecting them to be. My solution would be to go ahead and decide what you would have done with the ashes anyway, or come up with some alternative and try to move on. I recently learned a quote that “grief is just love with no place to go.” And those ashes were a symbol of that love finally resting somewhere, so I understand how this is hurtful. But the ashes went into the sea, so maybe you can think of your father as part of the sea. My mother wants to be part of a mountain she loves, and I’m planning to do the same with a much l
oved dog that I recently had to let go of. But be it sea or mountain or hole in the ground, the important thing is to remember and honor the life lived. I can think of worse places to go than the sea to remember a loved one. I was a big fan of the TV show Six Feet Under, so I hope folks don’t mind me posting a clip of how things can go wrong if you don’t have a plan for your ashes. It’s tragicomic and fittingly the one person who has a mental illness seems the sanest one there. Six Feet Under Scattering Mr. _PERSON_"

176267530,"I am so sorry _AT_MENTION_ that you feel you failed your son while he was in jail and at his release. I do hope you will not continue to feel that way. I feel that you must be happy with whatever you were able to do. There is no easy way to force help on someone who will not accept it, even those in the justice system know that. (I am a paralegal and work in the law field in a minor capacity, but I know the exact same type of case can have several different outcomes, and have seen it happen several times for different defendants.) Perhaps there will be some future point where his days in jail in this recent past will help him in the future. It was solely and only the 2nd arrest, the 2nd judge, and the 5th forced hospitalization (that the judge ordered her to when released) that got my daughter on meds. It could have come out any of 100 other ways for her, but we were lucky that the result was court ordered meds. In my state and county, Directions for Living will follow up on anyone just released fr
om jail to offer mental health help. That is where my daughter gets her meds and therapy. Plus, _PERSON_ health insurance has a counselor that reaches out to her. I am very lucky that society (police, jail, judges, therapists, social workers, detectives, sheriffs, involuntary holds, _USER_ID_, p-docs, etc.) helped me to get my daughter onto meds and is helping keep her on them. I hope the forces of the universe can come together for your son too."

176267535,"Yes. When my illness first began, I went inpatient multiple times a month. However, when you go in patient, it is usually because you’ve become a danger to yourself or others. Although, when you illness first begins, it can be so severe that you can not function. The inpatient, in my opinion, helps reduce the severity of the illness until you can function on a normal basis. You can communicate. When the illness first begins; for me schizophrenia, I could not function and I could not communicate. I could not communicate with my doctors or my family. The inpatient helped me regain functionality. Now, all that being said, when you are on year 10 of your illness, you know when to go inpatient and when not too."

I’m not sure if you’ve spent some time reading through any of the other threads but there’s something known as anosognosia, which reports say seems to afflict more than half of all diagnosed SZ. The condition means that somebody is literally incapable of seeing recognizing or acknowledging disease in their own body or within themselves. You often hear it referred to here as having ‘lack of insight’ when they suffer this. Many urge reading the book “I’m Not Sick; I Don’t Need Help” to better understand this phenomena as well as an excellent tool called the LEAP method to help you in engaging in a positive or productive manner to somebody in crisis. Great to hear the update. You seem to be a person of strong empathy. The best you can do now is educate yourself, and remember not to sacrifice your own health or well-being in the process."

One of the people I met at the _USER_ID_ family to family class had to do that for their adult son several times to get him on the right meds and into the out-patient system we have in the county.

Unfortunately, finding out where your husband is living and if that county court has the same policies is a barrier to your being able to get him committed ex-parte. If you ever do fill out the papers, be very blunt at listing out his inabilities to care for himself and how that is self harming to him (like he won’t eat regularly, doesn’t dress for the weather and goes out half naked, won’t take his meds, won’t s
hower or see a doctor for physical ills…) And do keep taking good care of yourself, having a loved one with a mental illness that causes hallucinations and delusions is so awful. But have hope and take good care."
176267563,"I do not feel good about this, but I guess I should admit that I am ambivalent in a certain way about my husband’s recent decisions to try medication again and about the fact that they are helping. I never considered separation when he became symptomatic a number of years ago and I felt good about my role in his recovery. Then he relapsed and I think it is really coming home to me that this is forever. I could deal with the extra burden in terms of finances, labor etc. I could even deal with the lack of intimacy. But when he pulls out of life, it really angers him if I try to maintain friendships etc. And this is not going to work for me in the long-term. So part of me is glad he is doing better (of course). But it also complicates things for me in a way that I am not proud of."

176267565,"Unnerving is a good word for it. When my husband and I first met with the psychiatrist our Family to Family class had recommended, I took the notebooks to show him. He didn’t do more than glance at them before setting them aside dismissively. He said they didn’t mean anything. He also crumpled up the paper with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder that had been issued by some agency my son’s employer had insisted on sending him to before he could come back to work."

Wisdom is right, there are many here who stumbled across this group but its been a welcome relief to me and many of the others, I’m sure. There is probably nothing you can say that someone in this group hasn’t been through before. I can only imagine what its like to have to deal with one’s own mother but I’ve dealt with other family members since my early 20s, when I didn’t know a thing about mental illness. Its been a long time and just having someone “out there” who understands what I’m going through is a welcomed support. Take care and please check in from time to time. We honestly like to hear how YOU are doing. Be blessed!"
176267571,Wow! It’s nice to have a conversation with you’re family member that has this problem. Especially when they know what they are actually going through. My 25 yr old son will ask me why the voices in his head are doing this to him. It’s so hard to hope he will someday understand the voices are just that. Voices. I love my son more than anything but it’s hard watching him go through this.

176267575,"Have you contacted the American Embassy to see if there’s any help from them? If he’s going to be deported anyway, you’d like to know that maybe there’s help on the receiving end. So, if he were to come back to the states, they might be able to get him into a facility upon his return. Do you have any old pictures? Eight years is a long time for him to avoid having his picture made with you. Kinda weird, really and I’ve been dealing with an ex and now my son’s mental illness for a total of 40+ years. I’ve never looked for an easy out but if I had a “do over” button, I’d be hitting it all.the.time. The resources you mentioned being hesitant to get involved in could be a big help. Your life is ALREADY revolving around his illness but its what you do with YOUR life that makes everything count. At such a young age, you’ve got a long life ahead of you and with an absentee husband, it can leave you depressed and miserable. Shortly after we were married, my ex began his flings with ot
her women. I didn’t find out until after my son was born six years later and my ex was on a training trip. I needed a map and checked his glovebox in his car, only to find a letter from a women he’d met during a previous two week training exercise. I was devastated. When he called that night and asked how things were going at home, I said “Oh, let me read you something I ran across.” When I started reading, he quickly said he’d call me from another phone - and thus began the lies - one after another. I’ve said it before - this life is hell, dealing with an SMI with my ex, and now with my son, it is sometimes intolerable. It’d be great if all turned out well but its possible that in more than 40 years, you will be me. Hoping to get through another day without the police, hospital admissions, paperwork based on the income he gets, and on and on. We tried so many meds to help my son - and my ex’s latest wife (fourth) says that my ex is just “needy”. His previous wife was a saint and put up wi
th so much more than I could have tolerated but in a sense, she was lucky in that they had no kids together. You said you were young and his illness was treatable - its also genetic. And by treatable, it never means cured. It may be controlled to an extent but to what extent remains to be seen. In reading these posts, keep in mind that one medication doesn’t necessarily work for another. If that were the case, my son wouldn’t be dealing with one hell of a disorder and we’d all be living happy, certain lives right about now. I wish you all the best but I don’t want you looking back 40 years from now and wishing you had made a different decision. Look into those resources and when you think they just don’t understand your situation - you can bet that someone sitting in a support group has been exactly where you’ve been. Take care of yourself and keep posting."

176267588,"(Sorry, this may be posted twice. I don’t know how to format this, nor how to delete my previous post. Confusing.) Our 23-year-old son has reached the point where we feel the need to reach out for help, for him and for ourselves. It’s a long story, and I’m struggling to write this, but I’ll try to summarize: He was born with a significant birth defect, spent his first 7 months in the hospital, 2 ½ years eating through a tube, and later had to deal with eating problems, delayed growth, small stature, scoliosis, and more. We’re sure this all affected him greatly. But despite it all, through his childhood he was an amazing kid in many ways. He was mostly energetic, aware, outgoing, curious, creative, and caring. He was popular at school, interacted with people, and had many enjoyments, interests, and plans. He became an excellent rock climber. Still, it often seemed he was struggling with things he didn’t share with us much. At 16 is when things really changed. We think (he won’t say) h
is only girlfriend ended whatever they had together, and from that point on he lost most of his spark for life. He quit high school and climbing, gradually lost all his interests and friends, became angrier, depressed, and increasingly paranoid, and has been going that direction ever since. We don’t think he’s ever been into hard drugs, but we do think his frequent use of cannabis may generally be amplifying whatever problems he’s having. After living his whole life with us in a small house we built, he lived in an old bus right next to us for the past few years, and then, with our help, moved into a nearby apartment a few months ago. His isolation, fear, and depression have worsened for years, until now he won’t speak more than a few words to anyone and avoids people as much as possible. Over the years he’s also developed the idea that we, his parents, are mostly responsible for his problems (we know we bear some responsibility because our relationship had problems), so he mistrusts us and minimize
s interaction. If we press him on anything, or even just talk with him, he either becomes rageful or almost literally runs away. Lately he won’t say more than a few words, and if we visit his apartment he won’t open the door. We don’t try to force anything, and we try to be as patient, understanding, and caring as possible. He still comes by our place most days, usually briefly, but seems to want nothing to do with us. Since his parents are now all he has and this place is all he’s ever known, he may be finding whatever comfort he can by coming here. We are heart-broken. For years we’ve done everything we can think of to help him. He’s always refused to consider counseling (or medication), so he’s never been diagnosed with any mental and/or emotional disorder. Our educated guess is that he may have schizophrenia, but we may never know. We both suffer anxiety, depression, and overwhelming sadness because he seems to be suffering so much, and may eventually feel the need to end his life. We’re a
lso worried that we ourselves couldn’t endure that. I know this is long. Does anyone have suggestions? We’ve thought of trying to have him taken in for psychological evaluation, but that involves the police entering his apartment. We’re worried that in his mental/emotional state he may pick up one of the knives he has and commit suicide-by-cop. Are there alternatives? Is there help?"

Whenever I go see her I have to promise to turn location services off on my phone and turn it off as well. Like your son, she stays in the room all the time. In this area I feel like she has gone downhill some. She also had a recent hospital stay because she did get anxious in the group home.

I may have posted to you elsewhere, so forgive me if this is a repeat, but the best thing I ever did was to attend a _USER_ID_ Family to Family class when our son was missing and homeless and we did not know if we would ever see him again. I learned how to use LEAP (“I Am Not Sick; I Don’t Need Help”) and with repeated hospitalizations, he ended up in a group home because we could not allow him to come home…He would not get better at home…he was actually of danger to himself due to not eating or drinking (catatonia), and he was also potentially a flight risk. All because he would not take meds. He has been med-compliant for over two years, gradually recovering, and TODAY he has held a part-time job for 6 months, plays sports, goes to church (his delusions or OCD about faith that wer
e NOT Biblical have disappeared), he volunteers, and lives in an apartment by himself. I still use LEAP as a practical communication tool because it works. It helps my son feel heard, listened to, and cared about."

176267609,"My Sz ex’s family are the ultimate “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps” people. Case in point, the family home he has lived in for the past 6 years (since our divorce) has been sold. He has a less than a month to move out. His mom has already been moved into assisted living (by sister and bro in law). So now he’s alone in the house with few prospects of where he is going to live, what he can afford to rent; his shit (belongings) everywhere— he’s s bit of a hoarder. In short he is overwhelmed. He HAS known he’d have to move all summer. But for whatever reason, did little to find a new home. I know he is cognitively impaired and very stressed. He cried a little over the phone. He’s seen one or two options. His next step is to apply for emergency housing for the mentally ill through the county. I’m angry that his family went ahead with the move without getting him settled in his own place first. They are not poor, and just sold the house . There are vague promises to help him fi
nancially. I get that my ex can be aggravating—believe me, I know!—but what about his being disabled does his family not get? He can’t do this on his own. My OWN family is more concerned about him than his own. They ask me, where he will live, how will he support himself, etc. Typical for my big Italian family. And they don’t particularly like him, but they are concerned for his well-being. I’m going to his house next week for 2 days to help out and better assess the situation.

176267614,"Thank you for your reply .- I appreciate your words . We have known for a long time that my son is ill and needed intervention from professionals but he won’t acceot at all that he is ill - we tried everything to get help for him. We were forced to sit and watch and wait until he did something criminal and be arrested. Living with the fear that he would either seriously harm himself or someone else on a day to day basis because he would be paranoid and so he would drink and smoke cannabis soooo much and steal and sell his things to do so then be so high and delusional he would walk into traffic, over railway tracks , shout and swear in public, he has been beaten up many times and hit by cars twice - he would sometimes get straight and appear to get a grip , find work, have a girlfriend, but always it went belly up we begged for intervention from every agency we could think of but were told if he won’t accept help there is nothing that can be done. He was a walking time bomb with paranoid delusi
ons which I naively thought were from his excessive cannabis habit - he fired an imitation fire arm at his neighbour six months ago - he was remanded in prison I wrote a letter to the judge saying that I truly thought that if that gun had been real he would still have used it - then started the assessments and psychiatric reports etc A hospital order has now been ordered ( we are in UK by the way) and he has to spend his ‘time’ in a hospital receiving treatment - he is struggling so much as he still believes he is not ill - I have been told he will get well ? I feel guilt now on top of everything else I won’t share with other family members as they are judgemental. It’s a very lonely place eh? I have been told he will be there the rest of this yr. He has nowhere to go once released as he his tiny flat has been repossessed by the council (state authority housing).

176267616,"My daughter will turn 20 in two months. It all began with a depression last January, psychologist couldn’t help much although she immediately started setraline. She first heard the voice in June which was very scary for her, voice is very hostile and commanding her to hurt her self. Maybe it’s important to say that she was a very happy child growing up, always considerate for others, funny and social so we never expected that her depression would take a turn like this. I have never known about the illness, never known someone. I now spend my nights reading books and searching the web, sometimes that helps me to understand what she is going through but mostly I get more confused. My daughter is now hospitalized sinds september, she is on medication, invega and olanzapine (maybe the names are not correct?) but we haven’t seen much improvement. She is also doing cognitive therapy. Maybe once a week that she is having a good day and I cherish those days. Seeing a glimpse of her smile gives us hop

I won’t say I want us to get back to normal, I realize that it will be a new normal.

I had just always felt that _USER_ID_ I guess, and really wanted to be able to protect his privacy… Now here I am, years and years later, more than happy to talk to anybody that will listen about MI and sz… Yet I keep coming across people posting about loosing themselves and then I can’t help myself from tumbling into a repeated and same process 
in my mind where I’m stepping back and looking at myself and it’s always the same: I never thought it was possible. I’m too tough. I’ve already been through too much. There’s nothing that could ever steal me from myself!.. and the reality hits me again. Years of the same painful and hurtful verbal abuse, the physical altercations we muscle through, always telling myself it’s the disease and not the person and trying like hell to change or manage MY responses but bracing for the next explosion that inevitably leaves me sucking all my air back in trying to regain my composure while he strolled back in ten minutes later like nothing happened, up all night never sleeping because he had an episode and tore out of the house to who knows where to do who knows what and I’m just supposed to pretend it’s all ok, never a courtesy call, no communication, rarely getting a chance to have a meaningful conversation, fighting every single time the regular stuff that most of us do every day, every week, every m
onth have to get done and for what reason I still to this day have not figured out what that impulse is or why he insists and is compelled to do that…(some kind of control thing? ) So I keep thinking I’ll never loose myself but I’m actually not being honest. Not completely. Not with myself. I have a handful of close friends, all very different and are close to me each for their own valuable reasons as people, but mostly because each is ultimately one of the most genuine and kindest people I’ve ever met, and each of those relationships of mine are very long term. And yet, nowadays I’m finding, not only have I realized I’ve been isolating now for a number of years but I also am having a hard time connecting with my oldest and dearest friends even when we get the chance. I simply don’t know how anymore. And when I do, there’s always criticism and skepticism and accusations at home that are just draining on my soul and my mind and it doesn’t stop there, it’s not just that I don’t seem to kno
w how to act anymore even with the people dearest to ME but I won’t talk to the bus driver or the mail man or the checkout clerk just to save myself an earful of absurd paranoid shit…, And so if I’m honest, yes. I have lost a lot of me. The me I’ve never ever had to question in all of my life. And I just feel somehow… gone. Like my life has become only this other person and it’s a person who doesn’t even regard ME (or thinks I’m an imposter in our own home. Yeah. That’s an oldie but goodie.) Sigh. I kept reading the question and thinking of all the positive changes that this has made for me, for us, like I said, being willing to talk about MI openly and the such, but I’m seeing now it’s almost just my own desperation. Desperation at loosing the best person in my life. Me.

As a caregiver I tend to adapt to what’s needed in a particular situation. It’s a symbiotic relationship. Nowadays I would say that I’m not sure if that was how I was supposed to spend my life, taking care of my mother and having no life of my own. I’m not saying I regret being her ccaregiver. Because I don’t. But somehow taking care of her began as this one - though very important - thing I had to do, and turned into my full time occupation.

176267647,"Hi all, I’m new and terrified and sick and miserable. My son is almost 20, so he’s right on schedule for schizophrenia. He is seeing a psychiatrist and is on a lot of medications. This has probably been going on longer than we knew but certainly since summer. FYI, the medication for side effects was a game changer, at least for now. Still not stable though. Anyway, I’m so sick about this stuff that I can’t eat or sleep. I’m still maintaining helping him but I’m going to burn out. My anxiety is so high that I never want to not be with him. It makes me feel better when I know he’s feeling OK. I can’t do _USER_ID_ online support because I don’t want him to hear me talking about him. I’d say stupid COVID but I’m actually grateful he’s in online school. I think we’d have to pull him out otherwise. I feel like my life is over and now will always be defined by my son’s illness, sorry if that sounds selfish. I’m scared he’ll kill himself eventually. I’m scared he’ll neve
r be happy. I’m scared and so so so very sad and stressed. I don’t know how I’ll ever survive this, except I don’t have a choice."
176267648,"While I’m glad that I see that I’m not alone, I’m sorry to see that so many of us r dealing with a spouse with SZ. My husband had a bad month last month, so bad that I had thought about possibly hospitalization (he wouldn’t have gone willingly tho and he’s not a threat to others or himself at the time) so that wouldn’t have worked. His psych upped his Depakote and he’s doing somewhat better. He still hears voices, is stil paranoid that the bank is stealing out money, and has recently become such a miser with our money. And I mean a total cheapskate. We have enuf money to do stuff, buy stuff, and have fun. But now I’m not “allowed” to even go grocery shopping without him becuz I might spend too much. I asked him last nite if I could buy something for $16 on Ebay (I’ve never asked to spend money before, it’s also MY money and I’ve just bought it, but I thought I’d give him respect and ask so he didn’t freak out) and he now doesn’t trust Paypal. Thinks they’re trackin
g our bank acct and will steal our acct number and wants me to close my paypal. Nope. Not gunna do it. He’s already done it. So now I can’t even buy something on Ebay? Last week he started yelling that the bank stole his pay (he gets paid per job so it’s little by little all month long and it was about $200), becuz he couldn’t see it in the balance. I added it with my calculator and it was correct. Then he got mad at me for doing the math. He thinks the bank steals from us everyday. So I tell him to go to the bank and confront them but he says he cant prove it so he wont. If it were me, I would switch banks. But he thinks the same thing will happen no matter what bank it is. SO we live with the fact that the bank steals our money everyday. Oh well. And all of a sudden last nite he told me I was a robot. Great. I asked him about that and he said “when ur able to understand, u will”. Most of the time I don’t even want to ask what he’s talking about. I just want him to keep his bizarre thoughts t
o himself and not even talk about them. Sometimes he’s open about them and sometimes he’s not. Then we argue and I beg him not to talk to me about it and life would be grand. Anyway, this past month he’s been doing somewhat better. He’s been working more which helps. Staying busy helps him. More than a couple days off is dangerous for him. Today is his 3rd day off and I’m scared. But hopeful that maybe this medication is helping somewhat.It IS helping his violent outbursts. Those r rare now. He only freaks out about once a week now, compared to everyday. SO thats a plus. Like I said, the voices are still there, the paranoia is still there, and this new cheapskate thing has been added. And I mean a total cheapskate. He’s super proud that h’s increased our savings as much as he has, and while I’m happy about that, I’d like to buy a pair of shoes occasionally! Anyway, it’s nice to know there’s others in the same situtation as me. Let’s keep up with one another and support each other. I ha
ve an appt this afternoon but I will reply to everyone personally tonite. Blessings to all of u! _PERSON_"
176267649,"I feel like other doctors won’t believe me either- it’s so exhausting. I really want the diagnosis so my struggles with negative and cognitive symptoms make sense. My partner and family also need to understand how severe my condition is - everything gets dismissed as anxiety and being too hard on myself (they seem to be in denial). This is not going away and it may get worse without medication, but it may bring me closer to my truth."
176267650,You will _AT_MENTION_ . Sorry you are so distressed today.
176267651,I wouldn’t do it. Why do you want to do it?

176267653,To be honest I’m scared a lot too. Worried a lot. Meditation helps me with this. Having worries and fears mean we’re living in the future and meditation teaches us to live in the present moment. It helps with my trauma too because by living in the present moment means I’m not dwelling in the past

176267660,4 years of sz. You?
176267661,"I think you should, yes."
176267662,"I am so sorry. I really am. I don’t know where you live or what is available in your area. Ideally an assisted living facility would be best and it is apparent from the behaviors you’ve described that he is not getting the proper treatment either because he is non compliant or perhaps because of street drugs (as you mentioned people with needles) -I would say he needs a court appointed guardian asap. If he is declared legally incompetent then it is up to the state to find a place for him and take care of his welfare. They will control his finances and can get court orders for treatment for his illness and if he has any dual diagnosis with drugs. It is a difficult road for him and for you and your family but as you listed above, things are not going well now. I would file papers with the court to have him declared incompetent. I would make sure the court gets the above list and any police reports or other complaints you can share. It sounds bad but they will approach him unemotionally and yet pr
actically. He has to do A, B and C…no negotiations. I am not saying it always works but I don’t see another path unless someone in your family wants to be named guardian and rep payee. I was both for my son and it eventually worked for him. It was incredibly hard to do. I often thought I wouldn’t succeed. My son wasn’t particularly violent but he was very unpredictable and hung out with criminal types and was destructive to property and to himself and did drugs as well. I ended up monitoring him 24/7 and I can’t even recount how we got from all that to the much better and saner and more normal son I have today, it all seems like a blur when I think back. Today he is 36, drug free, compliant on his meds and sane. He still needs to live with me, needs my direction, is unable to work and I still handle the majority of his finances. BUT we can talk and laugh and spend quality time together and I trust him not to be unpredictable. It is a great relief. We make good room mates. Your family has to decide w
hat will best save his life. He can’t do it himself. My best hopes for you and your family. Please take care."
176267663,"Hey _NAME_. _PERSON_, I’d find another therapist. Immediately while you’re still actually able to get your son to see one however unwillingly. If the therapist doesn’t know the term anosagnosia and isn’t willing to try other approaches and target maybe something other than the illness specifically, I’d venture to say this person hasn’t a clue what they are doing. CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) is a pretty common mode of practice for therapists out there and shouldn’t be difficult to find somebody implementing it. So many things can be addressed besides just the illness directly, such as identifying ones own thought patterns and processing ones own impulses; knowing the difference between thoughts and feelings etc. And considering ‘lack of insight’ seems to be in play, it sounds like the current therapist is doing exactly what Dr. _NAME_ warns us against and has been proven over and over to be counterproductive: Telling someone who is sick that they are sick and demanding they ac
knowledge it. Also, it can be difficult for any and all of us to find a good therapist for ourselves that’s the right fit, somebody that you ‘click’ with and feel comfortable enough to actually open up with. That’s not uncommon. The search continues… Afterthought: Is he seeing a psychiatrist or just a therapist? Has he seen a psychiatrist that’s willing to work with him?"
176267664,The max dose of chlorpromazine is 800mg. I now take 600mg
176267665,one thing i learned over the past few years with my son is not to take too close to heart any insults or criticism that are directed at me…he does not know his own mind…he doesnt want to say or do things hes told to say and do by the voices…the voices are responsible not the patient…just dont let yourself be too hurt by things she may say
176267666,What do the voices say?
176267667,"It’s something to look into. I have a feeling he won’t be able to take care of himself anyway. He can’t even keep his room picked up. He leaves dishes laying around, clothes and bath towels all in the floor of his room and he leaves food out. We have 2 cats and a small dog that will get into everything. He has to be told to put things up (more than once)."

176267676,"Thanks _NAME_. She has done pretty well over the previous 10 years, got a degree, trained as a midwife. She went on and off meds through that time - but mainly off I’d say. But she always resented being “parented” despite frequently asking for help. As long as she was in some kind of structure - school, job etc. it was always manageable with relatively few hospitalizations - and those always short. Then after finishing college and she could “get away” from our influence she did the ultimate “parentectomy” by going into a delusion that we’d abused her a a child. Then after a long hospitalization and meds that went away. Again after graduating in midwifery and no structure a crisis ( no meds) started the whole thing up again. Another hospitalization and meds brought her back for a while. The meds are the answer but even when we find her - how to even communicate as she is totally scared of us!"
176267677,I used to experience functional hallucinations but I don’t anymore.
176267678,"I used to do this with my pdoc Problem I have now is he calls me out of the blue rather than the official appointments. Pretty disruptive. Guess he’s trying to be helpful in doing that, but it makes it harder to plan for As for the other services, I have canceled them all. I don’t need these other people interfering in my affairs. Need to keep them all at a distance otherwise I will say something stupid and get hospitalised. Don’t like it when people who don’t know me properly think they can get involved in my care when it suits them"
176267679,I feel this way every time I see pictures of my _NAME_ when she was younger… she used to be such a happy child!
176267680,"I am desperate. My son was in lock down in a psychiatric facility on his 19th birthday. This was almost 2 years ago. He went from an intelligent beautiful soul and stunningly handsome young man to someone who didn’t even know if I was a real person standing in front of him. No medications have worked. They have either made the hallucinations worse or turned him into a zombie like state. Where can I go to get him help with natural or herbal medications they don’t have long term and permanent damage to his brain? Is there a natural alternative that can get him a normal life again? …or even functional life again? I am searching and researching daily and have been for years now. It’s truly like my son is gone and has been replaced with a stranger. We are open to any suggestions. This is not only immobilizing for my son it is also a tragedy for his brother, his dad and myself. I cannot sit back and watch him deteriorate. I have to do whatever it takes to help him have a functional life again. He 
is in no mental state to live a normal life. It’s sad. He is young. This should be the prime of his life. He is emotionless and just not there. Everything I research brings me to a dead end. I realize only 1% of people are effected with schizophrenia but these people are someone’s son, daughter, mom, dad, etc…Their lives matter. Their families lives matter. Why isn’t there more help for the people and the families that have loved ones with schizophrenia? It’s a sad and hidden brain disorder that most people effected by this don’t want to talk about. So many people brush it under the rug like it doesn’t exist. Anything you can share to help is very much appreciated. Thank you."

176267708,I appreciate your kindness so much. Thankyou. Very very good advice. Life is tough for us all and I feel annoyed with myself for complaining. Yet I know that’s not normal! Ridiculous. I’ve always wanted to give my boys the best of me and fill them with love and for them to grow up knowing that their happiness and wellbeing is of the upmost importance. That they matter more than anything. Give them what I didn’t have. I’ve succeeded in that since my eldest was born 17 years ago. My youngest is 10. Until last year I’ve succeeded in that. I’ve let them down and myself down. Got myself into a depression and spiralling. I loved my work and no longer in that position. First time in my life I’ve found myself behind on bills and worried sick gonna lose our home as not keeping up with rent. Hate myself for it all. Don’t see how it’s possible to turn things around at present.

I know that my sister’s cancer is contributing to it. I know that this trip to _NAME_ tomorrow is also contributing to it. Another thing that might be part of it is that I haven’t been keeping up with my coping skills of piano, yoga, prayer, meditation, etc… I’ve done none of it over the last 4 to 5 days. I will start up my coping skills again in _NAME_. If I’m not better when I get back, I’ll call my pharmaceutical pdoc."

176267712,How long did it take for you to get stabilized and start a profession?
176267713,"Before I quit working in the US: I lived at my Mom’s house and received no assistance to move. My Mom, and I paid for food, clothing, shelter, electricity, garbage pickup, water, and everything at her house. In fact it was mainly her. Late during that period I received discounted bus tickets. When I didn’t earn money I received no credit for working. When I did most of my money went to my Mother. My asset limit was $2,000. After I quit working: I received a nearly free government phone. I was assisted in finding a discounted apartment with free water, discounted electricity, free garbage pickup, and later I qualified for free food, and a lowered rent. I still had discounted transportation. My asset limit was the same for working as it was for not working. (Is it my imagination or people being rewarded for not working?)"

m trying to fill that void! anyway that’s been a positive out of all of this although there has been a lot of negatives as well, i get really bad anxiety attacks because i stress out about it too much, at one time my mom tried to commit suicide in front of me and i had to stop her i constantly think about this when i’m around where it happened or just around my mom in general! so that’s been a rough thing i’ve been faced with currently! anyway its glad to hear i’m not the only one with a parent who is affected by it! thanks for sharing!"
176267720,I’m with friends and I’m getting the most intense anxiety I can’t even socialize. I’m dissociating and having panic attacks off and on and flashbacks. I’m trying all my coping skills but nothing is working. I took medicine and it barely helped . I guess I just have to ride it out?
176267721,"If there is a _USER_ID_ near you, I suggest you call them. Perhaps someone at _USER_ID_ can give you some information, or put you in touch with someone who can give you information on how and where to get your son committed. It is hard to help your loved one battle their symptoms, and in the majority of cases, usually an ill person doesn’t believe they are ill and won’t accept help. It often has to be forced on them, which feels terrible to do. The more you can learn from reading on this forum, asking questions, going to _USER_ID_, and other resources, the better equipped you will be to decide what might help."
176267722,"I think that sounds very accurate, Hope. The mourning doesn’t go away. We just get used to carrying it. I feel like I’m such a different person than I was before my son became ill. Who could ever imagine…? I hope you’re doing well, and I hope your son is in an OK place right now."
176267723,"What the hell kind of advice is that? You should change your TURN SIGNAL FLUID, not your headlight fluid. Sheesh."
176267724,You have to try not to be lonely… I have no friends but i can honestly tell you im not lonely. I convince myself that other people will not improve my life in fact you can even think “hell is other people”. Change your thinking to eliminate your dependency. Try to identify what you are longing for and try to find nonsocial replacements for it. For example if you want someone to have a discussion or debate with go to a forum or write a letter to the editor or try calling a radio show or just read a book or write a dialogue. Honestly if youre tyring to find someone to satisfy a specific desire it will be difficult. Theres lots of people but only some people will be friendly with you and of those only a smaller amount will be your friend

176267738,"It’s late. I can’t sleep- but I keep thinking about this thread/post. I don’t know how a person comes in contact with a loved one with schizophrenia and DOESN’T lose a huge part of themselves. First of all- many of us were expected to put a hold on our life plans to accommodate the mentally ill person in our lives. I was asked to put aside my anger for the times my twin physically attacked me. For needing surgery after one of his attacks. I was angry and frustrated when my brother got me fired from a job. When he threatened a roommate and had me thrown out of my apartment. When he accused a lifelong friend of being a pedophile at her job. When you deal with schizophrenia- the first rule is avoid any heated conflict- and I have. But the price was deep and repressed anger on my behalf. How does a person NOT feel they’re drowning emotionally and inevitably lose their way under these circumstances? I know others also question their own sanity on occasion- and I get it. The feelings of over-re
sponsibility- the loneliness. I felt I HAD to be perfect at all times to match the feelings of urgency I felt for my brother. I HAD to forgive. I HAD to lift him up- always. I HAD to postpone my dreams to build him up after each hospital stay. In my alcoholic family- I didn’t feel like there was anyone else to help him. I HAD to allow him to paint himself as the victim. I felt controlled by the expectations of others that I- as my brothers twin- take care of him. Despite my overwhelming impulse to move- change my name- dye my hair and become a monk. The INSANITY of expectations we face- along with the feelings of over-responsibility for our sick loved ones. I always felt like “the asshole” between the two of us because I wasn’t sick. Not only wasn’t I sick- but I deeply resented being in this position of over-responsibility. Taking care of my brother was a thankless job. For decades. Like you- I just search for basic slivers of normalcy. Whatever ""normal’ is- in 2020 anyway. I isolate as well. Ha
ve for years because I don’t expect others to understand what this feels like. I simply got to a point where I had found my limit. I had had it with the abuse and the cruel behavior. I _NAME_ a hard line and have stuck to it. But I still hear about my perceived indifference and cruelty by detaching from my brother. From by brothers/sisters. From my father before he passed. He didn’t understand the basic idea that I simply did not want any further violence in my life. If that makes me an asshole- than I guess im an asshole. There’s a lesson here somewhere about why I feel a life that suffers has more meaning than someone who isn’t sick. I don’t want to feel that hope is something I have to be sorry for."
176267739,Clozaril didn’t work for my son but he’s resistant to medications - and he smokes which affects the rate at which certain dosages work. The part about the clone is something I always found interesting (although irritating) and is something called the Capgras syndrome. They believe that someone took over the body of a loved one so they tend to doubt anything that person says. It is very common. They have to increase the Clozaril over a period of time because of the bloodwork involved so be sure to question them if they release him too soon. My son’s bloodwork was done monthly after he came home until he was taken off. Clozaril has since been given a higher level of warning because of the side affects. Hope it works better for your husband - you never know - it could be the one! Best wishes.

176267747,"As _PERSON_ said, there are many folks here on this site that have experience with raising adult parents with SZ DX (more than you’d think, as MI can tend to be a hereditary disease) as well as parents with MI children, siblings with MI, and partners/spouses with MI partners/spouses. I urge you to keep checking back and reading posts. (You can read through old threads for days…) This is an excellent place to be for sharing/getting information, discussing concerns, occasionally sharing some much-needed laughter or uplifting, as well as just venting it all out if you need. Great group of folks here. Often if you post your own experiences or concerns, more than likely someone will identify with their own similar experience or needs and you can go from there (check “The Damage Caused By Being Irrelevant” and the “Treatment Resistant…” threads most recent) Glad you found us. I’m sorry for the circumstance…"

176267751,"She may be successful but I think Nash is a better representative for schizophrenia. He is the only one who got a Nobel and an _NAME_ prize. I think people here don’t realize how tough these things are, and assume that _PERSON_ is on par with Nash and thus may win a Nobel prize. In her field there is no Nobel prize, and secondly, even if there were, it is awfully hard to get one. For instance, this is the beginning of advanced mathematics: rudin ch 11.pdf (wisconsin.edu) I remember taking this course, and I think Nash is on par with _PERSON_ to win a Nobel and an _NAME_ prize considering the fact that he had schizophrenia. I say this because this is the absolute beginning of Mathematics. Calculus, Geometry, etc are not pure Mathematics. I should add that people see physicists as geniuses because physics is more intuitive and accessible for people. Pure Mathematics is pure reason, and the theorems that Nash came up with may be applied a hundred years later in Physics to discover or comprehend new 
laws."

Unfortunately my son has isolated himself and won’t accept the diagnosis and has no friends, job, family (except me, the punching bag), happiness, etc. It is nice to hear there is light in the tunnel!"

176267755,"Without this forum and _USER_ID_’s Family to Family, I would not have been able to get my son from point A to point C. My plan was point B, my son’s plan was point C. Point D may be where we end up later without either of us trying. Of course there’s a lot of the alphabet left… I do think the suggestions made on the forum that we family members push back on the most, may be the suggestion we need the most. In that I failed, when I have the opportunity in the future I must work harder on getting him on forced meds. I really wish I had known from the beginning that if a suggestion made to me on this forum made me angry - it was probably the one I needed to hear the most. I also wish I had understood the importance of my journey continuing along with my son’s. The mom in me wanted to stop my life entirely and help his life get on track to plan B. I can hope that my efforts at least contributed toward his plan C. When I joined this forum my name was hope in small letters because all I felt I 
had left at that point was just some tiny bit of hope. Didn’t have a clue what I was hoping for - its a journey without the destination or even your current location written on the map."

176267759,"Abstract Age plays a crucial role in the performance of schizophrenia vs. controls (SZ-HC) neuroimaging-based machine learning (ML) models as the accuracy of identifying first-episode psychosis from controls is poor compared to chronic patients. Resolving whether this finding reflects longitudinal progression in a disorder-specific brain pattern or a systematic but non-disorder-specific deviation from a normal brain aging (BA) trajectory in schizophrenia would help the clinical translation of diagnostic ML models. We trained two ML models on structural MRI data: an SZ-HC model based on 70 schizophrenia patients and 74 controls and a BA model (based on 561 healthy individuals, age range = 66 years). We then investigated the two models’ predictions in the naturalistic longitudinal Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) following 29 schizophrenia and 61 controls for nine years. The SZ-HC model’s schizophrenia-specificity was further assessed by utilizing independent validation (62 schizophr
enia, 95 controls) and depression samples (203 depression, 203 controls). We found better performance at the NFBC1966 follow-up (sensitivity = 75.9%, specificity = 83.6%) compared to the baseline (sensitivity = 58.6%, specificity = 86.9%). This finding resulted from progression in disorder-specific pattern expression in schizophrenia and was not explained by concomitant acceleration of brain aging. The disorder-specific pattern’s progression reflected longitudinal changes in cognition, outcomes, and local brain changes, while BA captured treatment-related and global brain alterations. The SZ-HC model was also generalizable to independent schizophrenia validation samples but classified depression as control subjects. Our research underlines the importance of taking account of longitudinal progression in a disorder-specific pattern in schizophrenia when developing ML classifiers for different age groups. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-021-00157-0?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed

176267765,"It sounds like your wife may have psychosis NOS means they don’t know what causes it (not otherwise specified) That is what our daughter was diagnosed with before she was inpatient and they worked with her months & it turned out to be schizophrenia. I think the reason the psychiatrist couldn’t diagnose your wife is because he didn’t have have a chance to “study” her. I thought it was noted that she was “well dressed” because some Psychosis patients don’t take care of their cleanliness. Your wife appears to be walking around undiagnosed. I would recommend YOU go to a counselor who works in this area they will help you maneuver through this difficult time…and trust me, you will need it. It is very typical for patients to deny, hide or say it isn’t true. We ended up having to call the police and have them take our daughter to a hospital… it was gut wrenching & horrible for us… but she literally is carrying on a normal life now & in the end it was the best thing we could have do

176267766,"Glad to help! I’d put more stock in a naturopath than a homeopath. Homeopathy is a waste of money, there’s zero science to it. 100% placebo effect. Also, antipsychotics and herbal remedies (including Amyloban 3399) are only bandaid solutions to the “oxidative impairment” state that the schizophrenic brain is in. From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/_PHONE_NO_, “Association of Oxidative Stress with Psychiatric Disorders.” “When concentrations of both reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species exceed the antioxidative capability of an organism, the cells undergo oxidative impairment. Impairments in membrane integrity and lipid and protein oxidation, protein mutilation, DNA damage, and neuronal dysfunction are some of the fundamental consequences of oxidative stress.” This means that the only real solution to cure schizophrenia is to overcome oxidative impairment for long enough, and to eat fairly nourishing, non-problematic foods (like wheat, which increases zonulin, th
at makes the gut lining and blood-brain barrier more permeable, or soda, which is a huge oxidative stress source, for two quick examples), so that the brain is in a net healing state and can heal the permeable gut and blood brain barrier that are allowing the reactive oxidative species to reach the brain, causing oxidative stress, which the body mounts an inflammatory response to, which in turn causes a chemical imbalance, that manifests as schizophrenia. So, in short, to cure schizophrenia, heal the gut lining and blood-brain barrier. Brain stops being attacked and becomes progressively more stress tolerant by the day. medicalxpress.com Inflammation linked to chemical imbalance in schizophrenia A study published in Molecular Psychiatry has identified changes in inflammation-related biochemical pathways in schizophrenia that interfere with proper brain nerve cell communication. Researchers have found the first direct evidence in support of... My favourite antioxidant is hydrogen water at the moment, but I’m 
going to switch to a hydrogen inhaler machine for even faster recovery. That’s all I’m taking at the moment! My chronic headache is almost fully in control now and my symptoms are quite low, all from hydrogen water (first alkaline water, which works via dissolved hydrogen gas anyways, then switched to a hydrogen water machine.) I don’t recommend that kind of singular approach, and I say if you have antipsychotics and supplements, use em. I’m trying to prove a point in putting my schizophrenia in remission with just hydrogen gas. It’s a cheap, free, super-effective antioxidant that I can’t find a single bad side effect for. My theory is that, once I graduate from hydrogen water to the inhaler, 2 hours a day of inhaling small amounts of hydrogen gas should provoke enough healing to overcome the oxidative impairment state and heal my blood brain barrier and gut lining. Once I feel good enough, I’ll cut down to 1 hour a day, but I feel I have to do that for life to maintain the healing factor. It’
s basically free! Minus the few pennies in electricity it costs to generate the hydrogen gas, and the initial cost of the hydrogen inhaler. Also some distilled water. Tons of studies on how useful it is.

An odd story: Of all the things thrown away or destroyed by my daughter when she was in psychosis, the thing I could never understand is why she took my lime green painted old decorative bicycle built for 2 out of my garden and put it on the street one day while I was at work. (Anything put on our street of value, or maybe not of value, is usually picked up by a scavenger within hours.) So it was gone shortly after she put it out there. She kept saying to me that she had to get rid of her step father’s bike, but it obviously was not his bike. I am still sad over that bike, it was one of a kind, and I love decorating my garden. But my daughter’s illness is controlled by meds now, so I have something much more valuable back in my life."

Personally, I haven’t seen definitive medical reports that say it is always genetic either. There is no cure for sz _AT_MENTION_ but recovery is possible for sure, at least to some degree. Some people never take meds and recover. Some get meds for awhile and come off and are OK. I know for my daughter, medication was THE only solution, and it had to be forced on her until enough sanity returned that she didn’t fight being medicated, but became willing.

I do the work of a devil’s advocate here, and attempt to present what might be going inside loved ones’ heads. As I said, we get these threads from time to time with variations of couples dating, or married, develop SZ before or after they get together, but yours is the first I can think of with the diagnosis withheld. I’m the victim of a similar deceit, and I can say the relationship is never quite the same afterwards and you struggle to trust the person ever again.

176267791,"When I go really seriously at powerlifting, I consume close to 250g of protein per day. But, of course, this number fluctuates depending on several different factors including muscle mass compared to fat, how active you are, and in general how your metabolism reacts. If you look a little harder, the amount of protein would depend on muscle mass to fat mass ratio of your weight; this at least has been what I’ve found. The more strenuous weight lifting, the more protein you need to produce protein synthesis. I don’t need that much right now because I’m not breaking down that much muscle. In general, I shoot for over 150g of protein a day. This is a lot harder in my circumstance because of my diet restrictions of being severely allergic to dairy and egg products. So my protein intake is usually consisted of meat and vegan proteins. Also, taking a judicious amount of bcaa supplements might help, too."

Her doctors/,therapist/community care workers and my husband and I all work as a team."

176267795,If you complain about the weather or your childhood it’ll do well on this forum.
176267796,"I enrolled on the “medicines” forum some time ago, and got banned from it. I guess I said something wrong or caregivers aren’t supposed to be on that forum, I honestly don’t know. At that time I wanted to talk to some people who were using Haldol."
176267797,"My husband with sz has been having massive anger outbursts. He screamed obscenities at me while he was driving our car with me in it. I can’t take it anymore. He won’t take any medication because he said the medication made him feel “sad” all the time, he seemed happy to me. I hate this disease, it ruins lives. It’s been chaos. I guess, for right now, he is better off by himself. I think our relationship was too much for him. Just the everyday stresses of a relationship I think is too much for him. I have a feeling he may just be better managing his illness on his own. He loves me, but I think he is trying to tell me he needs to live on his own. Which sucks, but it is what it is, and I have to accept it."
176267798,"Thanks _PERSON_! I have stopped taking care of myself since my dear child’s dx 6 years ago. I was obsessive about making him ok…meds, supplements, psychologist… Nothing works! After a while we are back to square one! In the last 6 years, he has been hospitalized once. And has sworn he would never go back again! At this moment he’s in the throes of intense psychosis. Angry, aggressive and not engaging with family! This has been going on for 3 weeks. It’s the evenings that he’s at his worst. So my fear starts building up late afternoon when he wakes up and the loud, angry soliloquy starts till 2 am in the morning! Some days he doesn’t sleep at all. I’m not sure how this is going to go?. Any advice from someone who has gone through similar stuff?? I’m in a constant state of fear and stress anticipating his next move. Thanks for going through my distressed note!"

176267802,Ok cool thanks this is what instead thank.
176267803,She is so upset with us because we will not agree with her about what she is seeing and hearing. So heartbreaking…
176267804,"_AT_MENTION_, you stated “just last month out of the blue he started hearing voices”. Since your roommate is “new” to hearing voices, this is the best time to try to support him in any way so he stays on medication and hopefully tells his doctor about the voices. Often a person with bipolar or schizophrenia won’t admit their voices to anyone. As _AT_MENTION_ said, “Realize that what they hear is important or concerning to them, and they are taking a risk telling you about it.” Oftentimes the voices are their friends, or special beings that watch over them, or give them special powers, or they could be very negative, causing much stress… My adult daughter talked to her voices for almost 3 years before I could get her forced onto medication which stopped the voices (hallucinations) and strange beliefs (delusions). The unmedicated years or wrongly medicated years were full of her staying up all night screaming at (to) her voices until she could hardly speak, and even then she still tri
ed to scream at them or with them when almost completely hoarse. Those people were REAL to her, and when the medication stopped the voices, she just thought her special beings had left the city. It is very hard on you to have to deal with psychosis, but your roommate probably needs your support. It is great that you came to this site, read and comment and educate yourself. Knowledge gives power to help battle the psychosis. The best thing to do is never to scold them, or belittle them, or put them down for their hallucinations or delusions. If you read that book “I’m not Sick, I don’t Need Help”, and put bits and pieces into use to help you cope with your roommate’s voices and odd beliefs, it can bring improvements."
176267805,"It’s encouraging to have you say that. Thank you. The last 10% seems to be the hardest nut to crack, but it will get sorted. Just taking my sweet time over it! One decision that I have already made once I am able to is to adopt a child who needs a home. Even if I had my own kids, I would still do this. Step at a time though"
176267806,"I feel the same! Social isolation and all the cool IG hashtags! Hahahahah! Wow! This is our life. Frankly, I enjoy staying home. Staying home does not mean I am not enjoying doing my own thing. There is a lot to do at home. The only time it suck is when I am super tired and sleep way too much. Or, need to get out and do errands and I do not want to. Hope everyone is coping."
176267807,"Right now, it’s trying to keep my SZ son from running around and not taking the pandemic seriously. His dad and I are both high risk due to our age (son lives with us), and he is oblivious no matter how many times we try to talk to him about this. He is 29, became ill his freshman year of college at age 19. This disease is exhausting."
176267808,I’m a potato _PHONE_NO_
176267809,"Other more mundane obstacles to phone use are: Having trouble keeping up with phone or carrying it and periodically losing it or charging cables. Inadvertently (or intentionally) putting phone in silent mode, or otherwise not hearing it ring. Forgetting voicemail password or how to work it. Forgetting to charge phone. Nervous of performance anxiety on phone calls. Dislike of being interrupted by phone calls. I know I’ve committed most of these with greater regularity than I care to admit. My brother with bipolar disorder is pretty much useless with his. He didn’t adopt it until quite late, but his landline was horribly unreliable, and he finally reluctantly got one. He still calls me on his landline exclusively. I wouldn’t take it personally, some people are just bad with telephones and communication in general—SMI or not."
176267810,"Hi, I went through this with my son he had early onset schizophrenia at age 16. He is now 23. He wanted to live on the streets so badly! I kept him off the streets for as long as I could. One day he left, spent about a week on the streets, then came back home. He has no desire to live on the streets again. See if your county has an outreach program. It’s called AOT (assisted outpatient treatment) in my county. They can help"
176267811,"OK, maybe all I am doing is venting here, but just maybe someone will have something useful for me. I am dealing with not only DD, but her BF, both of whom have schizophrenia. They are living in the townhouse we bought so they would have a decent home in a market where the rent would normally be more than their total combined disability benefits. We live several hours away, and rely on reports from sympathetic neighbors, only visiting when necessary. Following several years of relative stability, I just discovered that neither of them have taken meds or received any treatment since late last year. Predictably, things have totally gone off the rails. He appears to have returned to a life of petty crime, and possibly meth use. She has returned to her delusion that we are evil, evil people who want to do her serious harm. Concerned neighbors report that he returns home in the wee hours, slams doors, and yells at DD. She seldom leaves the house, and is rarely seen and never heard. We visited last weeke
nd, she knew we were coming and expressed no concerns. On arrival, we were shocked to see the condition of the home—absolute filth and squalor, and our DD, also unkempt. BF, typically friendly and happy to see us, was nowhere to be seen. We made arrangements to come back and take her out for a meal. When we arrived, she said she had ordered in, and proceeded to remove the piles of junk from the table, and tried to find unbroken chairs. Again, no BF. We tried to have a conversation about BF disturbing the neighbors, who are also concerned for her welfare. She vigorously defended him, and denied there were complaints, blaming me for making it all up. _PERSON_ made the mistake of asking if she was afraid of BF—which totally set her off. We left. I visited the Mental Health office the next day. DD had been on extended leave, and was required to show up for injectable meds. Apparently, late last year, she stopped showing up. Rather than having her returned to hospital, they failed to renew the order, and close
d her file. Of course, no one informed me, because ‘privacy.’ The best they could offer at this point, was to show up at her door, lay eyes on her and ask if she was OK. Done, over to me. I have limited options. Yes, I can probably get a judicial order for involuntary commitment. This would leave BF alone, off meds and out of control. Thus far, he has kept some of his activity away, but with her not there, who knows? I could evict him, which would leave him literally on the street. Also, he is a B and E expert, changing the locks won’t make sure he stays away. I am really sad that he is in this condition, as we have known him to be a wonderful man, and have been happy to have him in our family. Doing nothing, and waiting for the next thing to happen? He has a case working it’s way through the court system. In a perfect world, the result will be to send him to hospital. Back to DD, who is severely anosognosic, and as mentioned does not trust us (or anyone afaik). Her last hospitalization was after she 
had been on the street, banned from soup kitchens and homeless shelters and literally begging to survive. This time, she is invisible, possibly agoraphobic, and thus it is extremely unlikely that she will come to anyones attention to be forced into treatment. I have encouraged the neighbors to call police anytime there is a disturbance. Also to report their evidence of his illegal activity, mostly theft. They have been reluctant, partly because they are afraid of the very large and angry man. Everything is complicated by being several hours away, and coming up to winter with bad driving conditions. And I hate to admit it, but weighing heavily on me is that one way or another it will be up to me to clean up the physical mess of her home. So, yeah, looking for any suggestions, or maybe ideas about possible outcomes of any particular action. And if you got this far, thanks for listening."
176267812,"Well, you could try those. Perhaps you would be on fewer medications then."
176267813,I feel peace. I am having a good day.
176267814,"Yeah, that psychiatrist doesn’t seem to understand the reality of these delusional thoughts to someone with this illness."
176267815,Why don’t you think that? Please rationalise that for me. My reasoning is if they control the mind they can make it do anything

176267822,"I don’t know how much of negative symptoms are actually physiological, and how much is simply psychological in nature. I dunno, maybe I’m just ignorant on the matter, but perhaps setting small goals can help chip away at some negative symptoms. Like for example, “I will watch TV, but I’m going to try to use a recumbent bike during the commercials.” Personally, I’m not sure if what I’ve experienced in the past was negative symptoms or severe depression, but either way, it wasn’t fun. …Very difficult times. I will say that being on the right medications has helped me greatly."
176267823,I may not work (and havent done so for nearly 27 years) but i reckon im high functioning - cos ive got the insight to know when i going downhill and up my meds or ask for help accordingly. I know lower functioning junkies - that cant even maintain electric for the week or food.

176267829,My son also has SFI and I keep my communication with my son currently between him and I by asking him to ask the CW about his glasses for example so he does not start to feel that I’m doing anything against him and to get him to take care of himself as much as possible. It’s been weeks and he keeps forgetting. I take it one day at a time and hope to be able to figure out a way to find him friends in the future. There are many hurdles to overcome. I take him swimming. It’s the best I can do at this time. My son likes his workers but I’m unsure how much time they spend with him. I think he says no thank you to offers of programs etc. I think it’s just blood tests and medication. When I asked him if he attends any outings etc he says no he doesn’t because he gets too paranoid with groups of people when he has tried them. He will go out with me to places and really enjoys being with family for visits. Do you live far from your son? It would make it much more difficult for your son if he does 
not like his workers.

I once consulted on a play that featured serious mental illness and caregivers, and tried to stress to the cast that along with poiniant and sad moments there are small moments of humor and joy. If you don’t depict them both, you do the community a disservice. A friend of mine who works at a mental hospital often says, she wishes there was a realistic show about what goes on in mental wards, say on HBO or the like. It would better prepare people on what to expect, and show the broad range of emotion on display. Drama, heartbreak, absurdity and humor. Thanks for posting this _AT_MENTION_!"

176267843,"Its all about being able to filter out the symptoms for control of your conciousness. It can be done, and if done effectivly i would argue that person has acheived recovery or at least remission (whatever you prefer to hear at the end of the day). I went from not being able to get out of the fetal position to going outside again in the community, making new friends again, building lasting relationships, starting school, getting a job working 911, creating a support group, starting a business, completing two years of my pursuits of becoming a medical doctor, managing a sucessful business, getting engauged, taking care of my aging father, and advocating with _USER_ID_. I was able to do all this in less than 5 years time. Do I still have symptoms, yes every day unfortunatly, but with proper medication, living a healthy lifestyle and routinely taking prescribed medications, this is only the beginning. For me it was being sick and tired of being sick and tired."
176267844,I ghosted my therapist this week
176267845,Thank you so much _NAME_ I looked into some of these things and found a couple of helplines reminds me that when I phone the helpline all they do is push me to another helpline it’s useless… My mum I just spoke to her she says it’s far too early to think about and of course I’m thinking about it during these times… I will look into power of attorney At a later stage but thank you so much for your post isn’t it lonely when you think your family is the only fucked-up one
176267846,"Yes, my son does the same; can act normal . They wanted to discharge the same day he was admitted once. I refused… said you need to OBSERVE hims behavior longer. Tell him he has to stay… you will see the bad in him come out. Sure enough, they ended up keeping him."

Don’t give up!"
176267855,"I am just wondering what is your son arguing with your husband about? Are they reasonable arguments? I have breakthrough delusions and hallucinations too even though I am on two anti-psychotics, so it is perfectly possible to both work and still experience symptoms. I have schizophrenia, originally at one point another psychiatrist thought I had bipolar with psychosis which is same as schizoaffective. In any case, being with schizophrenia just means you don’t need to take a mood stabilizer. I also think if your son isn’t on an anxiolytic already, he may benefit from one. I take cipralex for my anxiety which calms down my anger, etc."
176267856,And happy cake day to you _AT_MENTION_!
176267857,Hi _NAME_ my son is taking 75mg invega trinza shot every 3 months on top of this he takes 30mg ability 50mg seriquel for sleep.he does get angry once in awhile because he still believes that the injection is poison and there was nothing wrong with him. This disease is so heart breaking
176267858,"I am so glad you are taking the risk to your 19 year old seriously. Its a serious situation and people can end up badly injured or killed, you are right to be concerned. Your 3 yr old and your 9 yr old have to be kept safe. My son’s delusions fixate on his father/my husband. I think its hard for people who haven’t had to face this kind of danger to realize how real the threat is from their family member. Its the sort of situation where I think its best to listen to advice instead of finding out for yourself. Keep your family safe."
176267859,"_AT_MENTION_ : This week has been relatively quiet BUT my 88 year old Mom had to have hip replacement surgery so my son’s been on his own a lot. I hide money around the house (usually a single $5 bill in each place) and he has to call me from the house phone to ask if there’s any more money. Since he has no cell phone, its kind of my way of seeing that he’s checking in and $5 won’t go very far, knowing that he won’t save any of it from one time to the next. My Mom called the house one day when I was en route and he actually answered the phone, telling her that he hoped she got better soon. Doesn’t sound like much but that was MAJOR! I had to go to the dentist today and one of the women in the office has a son with SZ, a year younger than my son and she was a month older than me. We spent time comparing notes, venting about the lack of resources in our area and how we find ourselves at our wits end. I told her about this site so maybe she’ll pop up on here one day! “…but realize i 
cant force the trust and he at least let me take him to it.” I think shows a lot of insight on your part. I hope he stays away from the alcohol but I know that my son will, maybe once a month, have a beer. In his case, it seems to calm him down but I don’t want it to be the start of a bigger problem with alcohol. So, I mention it, tell him that I’m not good with it and drop it. I hope things get better and that you’ll have less to worry about. Take care of yourself!"
176267860,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry for the rough time you are going through with your son. Does he have a formal diagnosis? When he makes the threats on his life do you call the police or emergency so they can take him to the hospital for an evaluation? Hopefully, he can be seen soon and get treatment and on a medication that works for him. It is very unhealthy for him to continually lash out at you. Do you have a therapist that you can talk to? That will probably help you take care of you. Also, please search for your local _USER_ID_ for support. Your spouse and other son if over 18 can attend the meetings for support. It’s easy for our loved ones issues to overwhelm us and takeover our lives but then we aren’t taking care of ourselves like we should. I hope things improve for you."
176267861,It’s annoying that the title is so misleading though. People will look at that and get a skewed perception of the reality of psychosis
176267862,I love science fiction and I get peaceful planetary paintings from painting space ships and planets…what do you think?
176267863,"There are no delusions that are not psychotic. If they’re not psychotic, they’re not delusions. Maybe something else. Bizarre ideas, maybe, as in schizotypal PD."
176267864,I get 15 minutes tops and that is plenty. I’ve done the intensive stuff and I’ve done hour long sessions and honestly I’d rather the current approach. I have a brain disorder that needs meds. If I need other support I’ll ask for it otherwise I have a good network of family and friends to keep grounded. I would just find it totally unnecessary for me. Not saying it wouldn’t work for others because we are all different. Just not for me.
176267865,"I am no expert on this, but don’t many providers issue their HIPAA forms with an expiration clause? Or if you go to a new provider, they would require their own HIPAA form to be signed?"

This illness can make a person distant, cold hearted, and seem like they hate you. You have a blessing coming. Stress is not good for you or the baby. Stay strong. Wishing the best for you."
176267869,"Perhaps it won’t help to fight it, but maybe to divert the conversation? Or ask where the person wants to go…and ask questions like “How will you get there” and “How will you pay for it?” Sometimes when there is no real plan or the stated plan or belief doesn’t make sense, the person will talk themselves out of their delusional thinking."
176267870,Yes but obviously the calories is a small meal (400 calories). And when you are used to eating its just a strange sensation.
176267871,My daughter has done well on the anti-psychotic Abilify (when she takes it). This has been advertised on TV as a “top up” for depression. Pretty weird.
176267872,"I believe that a lack of empathy is very common with schizophrenia. My own experience is that as the months (1.5 years now) go by on a medication that helps her, my daughter’s empathy keeps improving. It is much better than it was a year ago, and light years ahead of where it was when she was unmedicated or on a medicine that didn’t work well. While there were active hallucinations/delusions, her empathy was almost non-existent."

176267879,I think ‘brain damage’ due to meds is far less likely to happen compared to when I first got diagnosed in the mid 1970s. That’s because there’s a far greater awareness now of what can happen with high doses of medication.

He felt she exaggerated the situation, and probably she did, but he can’t see his 13 year old son at all right now. He should have had a good lawyer from the beginning, which might have, or might not have, changed the current outcome. Part of the problem is that judges simply lean toward giving custody to the woman in many situations, even without MI being involved."
176267885,Laugh out loud.
176267886,"Thanks wave to tell you the truth i was little scared, i thought my blood work will come out really bad i guess i was just too paranoid."
176267887,"It occurred to me to explain why our son does not live at home. In some ways, I wish he would, but he had been living independently since he went to college and he told me not long ago that our home reminds him of when he was here and really, really sick and that is hard for him. He desires to be independent so this is what we have chosen to do because we believe it is best for him."

176267890,For me they started 2yrs before my diagnosis and got worse when I got on meds.
176267891,"It improved after 7-10 years. I’m on year 10. I think 15 years is going to be even better. It’s hard to explain and comprehend but my vision and perception of reality was that of a low VR graphics playstation or nintendo type environment where I had DP/DR every day and extreme dissociation and no feelings like feeling numb, not existing, dead, and not feeling emotions or physical stuff and percieving motion. My perception of reality was behind my head all the way back in my skull. This lasted for 7 years. I really don’t know, can’t prove, or even care (shouldn’t care) about what happened to me in college. I have misisng days, months, and possibly years of time where I have no recollection or memory. Mild abuse growing up, possible alien stuff, and accusations I have possibly made towards people (true or not I cannot tell). I get information from my subconscious and parallel universes, which seem very real to me and hard to comprehend and examine and explain. I got sick at 21 years old fro
m a bad drug trip from pot and a possible milab encounter that was like Monarch Programming, Secret Space Program alien abduction stuff, and Montauk Project stuff. Stuff that doesn’t exist, I’ve been talking about it for years, and I shouldn’t really care or self-reflect anymore. I thought it was just evil people and even self-examined and looked into the whole Illuminati thing… Anways, I’m 31 years old now and I can percieve reality better not like an insect or bug but as a normal human being now… Maybe I’m not a super soldier and maybe I shouldn’t reach out to people and seek help or beg for help or money and talk about it anymore. I enjoy listening and learning from others that are likeminded and had similar experiences they deem real. Vraylar really helped me. I think maybe it was aliens or something or mk ultra monarch. I read books and watched videos on the stuff. I have found my religion and faith and higher power. I feel like that’s good enough now. I really don’t know what happene
d to me, but it felt like it could have been anything. I rather not go into details, but maybe I was gone for 3 days, 1 week, or a month. Maybe I wasn’t gone. I don’t know if I’m just a random person or statistic or victim here. I have a victim mentality. Maybe it was all aliens or mixture. I have this strong feeling I’m repeating time. I cannot and rather not go into what I went through. I have self-examined and googled many things including me being the original inventor of bitcoin _USER_ID_ in my original life or what seems like base reality in a different life or reality. This might be the first time in a billion trillion lifetimes I figured it out. That I created bitcoin when I was 18 and don’t know how or why I did it and I deeply regret ‘changing the world and making an impact’. I think aliens have been monitoring me and have been interested in me and have helped me and even hurt me in my other lives. I cannot and don’t know or have the abilities to program or create anything anymore du
e to trauma and SRA type stuff I experienced before in my memories as an adult. It seems so real. Talking has helped me and it has also made me paranoid. I wouldn’t be surprised if these things are real, I got DID or dissociative identity disorder too. I have no money and I’m not rich or a billionaire or have no desire to be one and had no desire to make a big deal about it or be famous. I don’t even know if it’s real. The weird thing is when ‘they took me’ I mentally and consciousness age regressed back to zero or 0 in 2011 and started thinking I was a baby or child which is common sometimes. The whole mars thing might not have been real at all or it could have been. I cannot really blame anyone or blame one person or group of people except myself for creating something I had no business in doing or knowledge of what it would do. Bitcoin isn’t illegal but creating a currency is and I don’t even know if I did it or not but I got tortured and lost the bitcoins. I don’t want them or need them. 
I just want to be left alone I think. Like I said I don’t even know or possibly think it can or could be real. I wake up back in time as a schizophrenic with no memory and feel like I had my mind uploaded to a computer and stuff. Happens in every life. Sort of like a causal loop for eternity. I even speculated or thought it was because I was _NAME_ titor or something, but now I’m realizing that’s not the case. I still think the _NAME_ titor stuff is a legend but real. Like I said my current delusion or thoughts is I created bitcoin, but had no cognition or memory of it since 2007-2020, 13 years. It’s just another stupid hunch or delusion I have. My family is perfect and nice and great. Maybe aliens helped me. In my dreams I think I talked to _NAME_ in a past life and I was a poor student in high school with low IQ. I even thought that time travel letter to _NAME_ from _NAME_ at the starbucks in college in the bay area was about _NAME_ titor, simulation theory, and time travel, but now I think it was a 
fake letter I wrote about _NAME_ from _NAME_ chaum which was part of the mind control. anyways, that’s my current theory. (I even speculated robots and stuff). I think the aliens and government are using time travel to change the timeline for the good or even for personal sake and benefits. _USER_ID_ was a username and I wasn’t trying to hide or be sneaky or anything at all. I’m very upset I have schizophrenia and the aliens told me in my dreams that I could have been a doctor instead because I could have or wanted to help people not this stuff."

176267898,"_AT_MENTION_ As part of that small percentage, I whole-heartedly agree with that sentiment. _AT_MENTION_ your friend may have the potential to be part of the small percentage. His early onset seems a bit of a negative to me, but it could be that his SZ was discovered and treated early. Early treatment, above average intelligence and good personal insights into the disease are positives. I’d say the structure and social networking of Scouting are positives as well. If possible, I’d recommend some form of talk therapy in addition to medication, and psychosocial/occupational therapy (school and Scouting in his case). It’s not for everyone, but with sufficient insight into his disease and relatively mild symptoms it can be helpful, and trust gained with the therapist may reduce the impact of worsening symptoms. I’d recommend starting quite slowly or platonically first, for several reasons that caregivers here might not consider. Being infatuated or the initial stages of being in love releases n
eurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin which are targets of anti psychotic medications. Generally my least stable periods have been in the highs and lows of love affairs. You get better at managing and adjusting medication to compensate, but I tend to crave emotional stability over passion in relationships for that reason. Also, you may find him distant and cold as a result, or just by nature. So if you are looking for broad expressions of affection reciprocated, you probably should look elsewhere. SZ affects both thought and emotion, and I at least get a bit mixed up between the two. It doesn’t mean we don’t have emotions, but they can be blunted or delayed. I tend to reserve emotion until I think things over. I can also get emotional thinking about things that happened years ago, or projections far into the future. I’m rarely emotionally available in the moment. I am childless for various reasons, but mainly because SZ is highly heritable and I’d prefer not to pass a chance of the illness onto ch
ildren, nor have the stress of raising children trigger a relapse. Raising children is stressful enough without the potential that they may develop a mental illness in their teens or twenties. Parents of this forum have my admiration. I also would dispel any romantic notions that love would heal him, or that you will somehow change him. Some popular movies perpetuate this fallacy. I highly recommend reading biographies and other books over movies, as they tend toward more realistic and practical portrayals. Even then, bear in mind when you read a book, you’re reading something written by or about a small fraction of the top one percent. _USER_ID_ can also be an undesirable aspect of a relationship. Your parents or friends may not approve of your friend, and make fun or you or him as a result. Your friend’s behavior may embarrass you in social situations, and there may be misunderstandings of social situations. You’ll either need to be socially secure, or not care much about what people think. All this s
aid, if receptive, people with SZ desperately need friends they can trust even if they don’t realize it themselves. It isn’t easy, and as with any relationship there’s the potential for loss. However they can be interesting companions who see the world in a unique way. But that’s all potential. I think the extended prodromes of SZ and Bipolar disorder make a good case for delaying marriage until your late twenties or thirties, if there’s any mental illnesses in a potential mate’s family. I’m including some links to my favorite _NAME_ talks of highly functioning people with SZ. They seem a rarity, but many of us are afraid to come ‘out’, and are often too busy living our lives to advocate much.

You must do the research on this to understand it before you can have any hope of helping someone with this condition called ANOSOGNOSIA. It affects 50% of persons with SZ!"

After at least an hour of this, I ended up kicking him out of my car, convinced I would be murdered if I didn’t, 6 hours from home. He was terrible at being a person in general, had a reputation for beating women, so I never have felt bad for this. Now it’s just funny. He ended up making his way back home a week later."

176267911,"Hi there, My son was 18 and a half when he had his first break. He had anosognosia (still does) and refused medication, finally went on, went off, many hospitalizations. Now he is in a mental health court program and he is doing amazingly well. I see glimpses of my son, who we lost to this disease, coming back out of the darkness. It will never be the same but he’s alive and he’s medicated. He has a job, he’s learning to cook, he smiles, he’s happy. I’ve spent three years being very sad and depressed over his disease. It has taken a lot to get to the point where I can accept this and move forward with hope. You will get there too. My other son has had a very hard time with this. I think it is very hard for siblings because they have fewer people to talk to and understand their loss. I wish you could talk with each other! I can tell you that your brother needs you to be there and to help. Your parents need you too. And, you have to take care of yourself. My son went to counseling to help h

176267920,"I related this to my sister recently, and she cited it to clerical worker so she could pay my brother’s bill after he had declined the HIPAA form we’d filled out for him to sign. We find you can often slip-in things by him like that by offering low-friction help setting up appointments and filling out paperwork. In this case medical staff colluded with us and told us to check a box on the HIPAA form that allowed information sharing within the healthcare group as as preemptive measure. That way we could leverage a doctors appointment to gain access to psychiatrist information in the future. He was hoping his GP would prescribe psych meds (harsh old-school stuff like Navane) without seeing a psychiatrist. Oh well, it was worth a shot.

He smiled and felt pride like I have not seen in years. In reality he lives in a halfway house due to drug addiction along with his schizoaffective disorder.

176267954,"I’d consider attempting to getting his psychiatrist to switch to a different antipsychotic. My experience with risperidal was accompanied with a deep depression, social withdrawal, work absences and poor performance. This was when the drug was initially introduced and there were fewer alternatives. Antidepressants didn’t seem to help in the limited time that I took them, but changing my antipsychotic and interventions in my social and work environment along with a change in medication helped me significantly. Responses to particular drugs are highly individualistic, so changing medications based on one person’s experience should approached with caution. A psychiatrist’s care is essential to such changes. I was also under a psychologist’s care for the duration, but in retrospect I feel changes in environment had far more impact on changing my frame of mind than talking about my problems."

He lives at home, used to have a part time job but since his last episode last year has decided he doesn’t want to work. His room is a mess, he doesn’t know how to cook a thing except peanut butter sandwiches. I tolerate all this because he has schizophrenia. He can go and spend time at a friends house a few days a week and he can go to his spiritual healer’s house and hang out there a few days every now and then. I’m thinking that he needs to go into assisted living or a group living environment where there are expectations that he will have to live up to and learn to be a participant in the adult world.

176267994,"Thank you for sharing about your struggles and your sons struggles. Your story is like my sons story at the beginning stages. You are right- it feels like a nightmare all around. My son is 34 and diagnosed schizophrenic. It seemed to start at about 18. Before that it seemed like he was just a overly spunky kid. We had him committed because he became suicidal. The courts dismissed it to out patient services and meds. Well of course that didn’t go well living in a rural area and he was an adult. Started getting into drugs, in and out of jail. court ordered institutions. He would do well and bounce back at the beginning. But I couldn’t make him stay on his meds. Off and on and off and on. In and out of trouble, homeless. I noticed each time, with the abuse of his meds and drugs, that the bounce back became less and less. Fast forward to his age now, he is 98 % delusional. I fear to the point of no return honestly. Each facility or crisis center, jail, claim to stabilize him and put him back on the 
streets with no assistance. Currently the only reason he is at my house, is because the crisis center where he was in another state were going to put him in a facility but realized he had no identification and would almost be impossible for his SSI to be turned back on to pay for it, they bought him a bus ticket back to my state to fend for himself. Even I talked with them, it was not a good idea. Thinking back now, I wish I would have gotten over the shock and denial that he had mental health issues and educated myself more. There weren’t as many resources as there is now a days. It may have helped me to help him better. I wish you strength in this journey. Just know you are not alone. After reading many comments, those comments are my stories as well."
176267995,"I suggest setting a fixed time and length to the calls. In situations where I’ve had similar calls from institutions, I found doing this tended to make calls more focused. Don’t forget you are in control, you don’t have to answer and pay for the calls if you don’t want them or when they are upsetting and unproductive. I’ve witnessed much hand wringing, self doubt, guilt and repeated enabling that my parents did with my brother. They learned from their mistakes with me. I’m self-supporting and independent; my brother is not."

176267997,"Only speaking from my own experience here (my mom, Aunt, and cousin), but one of the hardest things about schizophrenia is the lack of insight someone has into their own mental illness— In their mind, even when they are medicated and the symptoms have reduced— they are totally sane and we are the ones who don’t really know what is going on. The only way I am able to have a relationship with my mom is by temporarily accepting her version of reality— if I push back she totally withdraws. In her mind she lives in a mental ward because she is there to pray for and help heal the patients— she is not a patient. She doesn’t take real pills, they are “water pills” so that the other patients don’t catch on. I understand that she needs to believe this— and so I just go along for the ride in order to have any kind of close contact. I wouldn’t say anything, just treat him like he is normal and like you don’t know anything, the same way you might treat someone with any other kind of illn
ess— it is their’s to disclose and I think this is one of the biggest gifts you can give to someone who often has many assumptions made about them…and over time it might lead to the kind of trust you are looking for. Can I ask, does you husband know you are in contact?"

I can go north, south or east to find a meeting three times a month. I myself am doing awful today. My daughter continues to do well, and so the problem with my husband is seeming worse and worse to me. I am going to have to force him to rehab tomorrow. Rehab is set up, but he won’t go. His alcoholism has been enabled by my ignoring it for years, to this point. Because it is episodic and usually non-violent and non-aggressive, I’ve ignored handling the problem. It will probably mean divorce, losing my house, losing the business in our house (back house rental), and working the rest of my life (never able to retire). But this can

If they have the symptom anosognosia, conversations can cause more problems than they solve. In Family to Family they told us that usually when parents differ, it’s because they are on different levels of understanding the situation themselves. My teacher said that respect had to be mutual and we had to keep in mind the limitations in place because of the mental illness. For my husband and I, it was tricky to figure out our son’s limitations initially. This is an illness that cycles, things my son can do one day, he can’t do the next."

Car insurance, which covered the expenses from the injuries, and work insurance which paid my income while I was disabled. The case manager that I had at the time, was playing both sides getting them to simultaneously screw me over until I had a nervous breakdown. Shortly afterwards, I had a meeting with him. I told him that I had attempted suicide, and he blew it off as if it were nothing. I had a 9-iron under the couch, and everything in me wanted to take the top of his head off. But I stopped myself, thinking he might have kids Though I know I made the reasonable decision, there is still part of me that wishes I would have done it. It would have been justice served.

Last week was just orientation, so it involved a lot of being bored sitting through PowerPoint slides in a conference room. Next week I will actually be on the floor training and I am very excited for that. I have started participating in hobbies again. I have worked out a plan to make some positive life changes for myself. My best advice to those who go through (clinical) depression is just to be kind to yourself when you are having episodes. I tend to beat myself up and focus on how I shouldn’t be depressed and that I should be more functional. Treat it like you have the flu. Rest as much as you need, lean on others if needed for care. Know eventually you’ll get better and the episode will end."
176268011,"We had a great few months, the Depakote seemed to be working on hubs violent outburst really well. Of course his bizarre thinking, hearing voices, and paranoia continued, as he refuses any other meds cuz he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong (he KNOWS he’s fine and he wishes I would know what he does and maybe I’ll live forever with him. Whatever. I’m not reacting to him anymore and it’s causing alot less strife at home. And his paranoia has increased alot (EVERYTHING is against him. He believes that everything and everybody in the world does everything specifically against him personally - like when we go to get gas. Gas prices r raised just for us. When we get gas, they r then lowered afterwards. We’re trying to buy a house right now. Everyone involved is out to rip him off - the realtor, the sellers, the inspectors, everyone. And the price is just for us. After we buy it, the price will drop. Its fdriving me nuts) Anyway, this past week, his violent outburst r back, just out of t
he blue. I was sitting in my recliner (we’re temporarily living in our RV in our sons driveway while we look for a home to buy) on the laptop when he flew out of his chair and started yelling at me, saying super bizarre stuff about my “computer” (he believes everyone has a computer running them and they have either negative or positive programs, mostly negative) telling him what to do and a ton of other bizarre stuff I cant even remember now. Totally crazy stuff that made no sense. Then he went outside and my son and DIL went out to see what the commotion was and he started yelling at them (he usually only shows his outbursts to me). I didn’t react. At all. Normally I would argue with him, cry, try to rationalize. That never works. Not reacting worked better, nothing changed but it was over quicker. He did say he wanted to kill himself. I came super close to calling the police but then I thought ""No, he has to work tomorrow and I don’t want to risk his job, as thats the only thing that keeps him se
mi-sane (when he works, he’s “normal”. Staying busy literally keeps him sane). I know thats a stupid reason to not call for help but I didn’t think he was t true risk. A couple of nites later, he lept out of bed at 2am, yelling about how the computer was making him old (thats a biggy for him, getting old and his computer was making him look old and wrinkled) and he yelled for about 20 mins and finally got in his car and took a drive for about 30 mins (I was worried sick the entire time) and came back much much better). He’s had smaller outbursts everyday. I’m trying to keep him even, giving him positve attention, trying to redirect his attention if I see he’s about ready to go off the deep end, not reacting if he does go off. Every single day his bizarre thoughts and paranoia seem to get worse. And the Depakote isn’t working for that, at all. He refuses all other meds. His psych appt is the 17th nd he’ll be totally normal for it. I wish the anosognosia would allow a small window of time of u
nderstanding so that he would actually see whats happening and try a medicaion. But he thinks theres nothing wrong and theres something wrong with the rest of the world for nt believing in what he believes. I just dont get it. Anyway, after that long novel, my actual ?: If it happens again, as I’m sure it will, how do I get him help (like hospitalization) without getting hi arrested? And if I call the police, and they come out, do they take his word or mine? If he threatens to kill himself and I call someone and they come out, if he tells them hes fine and I’m lying, do they take his work? _PERSON_ if that happens, that will be World War 3 - if I call the police on him and he doesn’t get any help. I’m scared to call the police. I’m scared that #1 he’ll be arrested. I don’t want him arrested. and #2 he’ll lie and it will come back to me and it won’t be pretty to live with him aftter the police leave. I appreciate all of ur knowledge. Hope everyone is doing well! _PERSON_"

176268013,I am so grateful to be able to process what has been happening to my kids and I and make more sense out of it. I have learned some very interesting things and I am also able to see it from an angle I never saw before. I kept thinking I needed to save his life. He’s confused and doesn’t know it . He’s sick and isn’t aware. I see how very frustrating that can be for the person who has this Happening to them and me as his wife keep telling him he’s sick he doesn’t want to hear that. He is also not sick meaning like with a cold going to get better. This is his normal so I need to not keep telling him. I just can’t get him to help and our loved one is causing grave trauma and abuse. But is this the cards we are dealt and it is what it is. Bc I kind of feel we don’t get to pick and choose our family. So are we to just deal with it. He won’t get help. Directly refuses. Says he knows.
176268014,"I wasn’t sleeping and I was using stimulants. I believe it put me in a suggestible state. Then my paranoia of the police was extreme. Slowly I began to hear voices and went into a psychotic mode. Since then, 2010, I have heard voices, minus a year with when I didn’t. When that year ended, around 2015, I started having bad hallucinations again. The auditory hallucinations have been non-stop since then."

176268023,"I’ve had this belief. I thought the next door neighbor was spying on me. I lost my home because I had this belief as part of my schizophrenia. The belief can be dangerous to yourself and others. Try and talk about this belief with a mental health professional, before it goes too far. I don’t know why this belief comes with schizophrenia, but I try and maintain that it’s not the neighbors and no one is out in the neighborhood, to push thoughts into your head nor hear your thoughts. The delusion that someone close by is talking to you or about you, even to me 10 years later, comes to the surface often. For information, I didn’t confront my neighbor or other neighbors in the neighborhood. This delusion may not go away. I suggest trying to keep the state of mind that no one is out to trick you or mess with you."

To answer your question, the experiences I had were unique, pleasant, and gave me certainty that a person’s own consciousness can exist separated from the body. It usually happened to me when sleeping. The first time, I simply was downstairs in the kitchen watching my mom cook. Later when I woke and went down to the kitchen, I tried to tell my mother I’d been watching her and what she did, but she was astonished at what I said and sort of shaken up.

He’s a firm believer in the genetic factor, whereas I lean more towards environmental and childhood psychological trauma being the bigger instigators of sz. But I’m not ruling out genetics either. Then I have my younger son with sz, well, he can barely take care of himself, so maybe it’s a good thing he will not have any children. If someone told me 10 years ago that I would never be a grandmother, I would have never believed it. I honestly was looking forward to a couple of grand daughters.

176268070,"Thank you- I really would love to get my son in a group home- the hospital social worker was supposed to put him on the waiting list, and I haven’t heard anything back yet. I think that’s a great option because there’s interaction with others, and my son might feel like he’s somewhat on his own instead of living with his mom- he really wants to be out on his own, so this would be an option I would agree to. He can’t be “alone” in a place- even just yesterday, he didn’t turn the coffee maker off and it was such a mess when I got home. He wants to turn the Christmas tree lights on, but I’ve said no- he just forgets things so easily, and it’s a huge safety concern."

Here are the facts— Closing the Donation Gap Although organs are not matched according to race/ethnicity, and people of different races frequently match one another, all individuals waiting for an organ transplant will have a better chance of receiving one if there are large numbers of donors from their racial/ethnic background. This is because compatible blood types and tissue markers—critical qualities for donor/recipient matching—are more likely to be found among members of the same ethnicity. A greater diversity of donors may potentially increase access to transplantation for everyone.

176268087,"Hi grace. Quick question: was this a behavior that was NOT noticeably happening while he was on the mood stabilizer? I’m extremely curious because this is a VERY familiar thing too for me during conversations with my unmediated partner and it has always been that way. It can make it extremely difficult to have a meaningful conversation at times or discuss important relevant topics. As you stated, I always figured it was some form of persecution complex also, or maybe a compulsive issue where he may feel that contesting or arguing every single statement in dialogue makes him FEEL like he’s having a meaningful conversation of sorts… in his own ill-understanding of basic acceptable social interactions in his own slightly diluted reality. And I thought also too about what I call the ‘defeatist attitude’ or ‘fatalistic attitude’ where the conversation goes nowhere because everything is always ‘all is lost’ and ‘already over’ and ‘dead already’ so there’s no bringing him back 
to the conversation to move forward in the dialogue with any progression. These three ideas, interestingly, (persecutory, defeatist, fatalistic or catastrophising) are all considered ‘Pillars Of Irrational Thinking’ in some schools of practice like CBT (cognitive behavior therapy). Which, by the way, is not a therapy specific to mental illness. A lot of us actually do these a lot in our own minds all the time for a lot of different reasons without realizing it when we’re feeling low or depressed (nobody likes me anyways, birds are always shitting on MY car etc…) Overpersonalizing things that otherwise often have a completely reasonable explanation. So, is it a mood disorder, or is it part of the more severe MI diagnosis like schizophrenia and bipolar commonly associate with delusional symptoms? Is there a way that we can actually determine that? Let us know what you learn. Best of thoughts."

176268092,Why not just taking a standard multi vitamin?
176268093,"Yeah, most people with SZ are borderline agoraphobic anyway. Social distancing is the norm unless you are in recovery or recovered. It’s just easier and less stressful and stimulating. Even those who have contacts are more likely to do them online. My main concern is for people who work freelance in the ‘gig economy’. Uber and Lyft driving gigs may be way down, but DoorDash and UberEats may be up, so who knows? I also think the marginally employed may be left out of any stimulus payments. I think employment is very therapeutic, so it’d be a shame to deny people who can work opportunities to succeed. Personally I’m looking forward to getting caught up on my many backlogged projects. Not sure I’ll be sharing nitro airboats like _AT_MENTION_, but I’m sure I’ll keep busy.

I’m tired of her saying that my daughter needs a qualified person to pray over her since my daughter has obviously opened some door to make her self susceptible to satan, according to my sister-in-law. I have 4 children. One is still very young. My older children are 16, 19, 21. Two oldest have suffered from severe depression and then my daughter 16 is dx sz spectrum which my sister-in-law labels all of this as a spiritual attack on our family."
176268098,"Great topic. Very frustrating. I once warned any caregivers in the ER where we’d been stuck for hours that if they didn’t get my son quickly into a facility or on his meds, there would be problems. They basically patted me on the head and said ‘we’ve got it’. They finally got a psych consult via Zoom (mid-Pandemic) and then asked me to leave. My son was mid episode. They didn’t ask him, they just asked me to leave. I left. Pissed. And said, ‘It’s amazing that no one wants to hear from me’. Minutes later the head nurse comes racing down to the waiting room to ask for my help in calming him! I said, “No one fng believes me until they see for themselves”. I was less than endearing to the staff for the duration of our 20 hour ER hold until we finally got admitted. If I were completely sane before all of this, I am no longer!! Further, beyond almost intentionally cutting parents out (hiding behind the HIPAA!) , medical caregivers seem loathe to cross coordination. Do you want to sp

Yes, you’re the Doc, and he is your patient, but I’m fairly educated on the available meds and know of prior prescriptions and failures. No? Wow. We’d never expect this on a complicated cancer case.

You can also check with your county/city mental health department and see what it takes to take out an ex parte order. You will need a witness and they will send it over for a judge to sign off on.

Honestly, when my daughter was in the hospital the first and second times, I could barely relax and take care of myself. I remember now how one of the nurses said to me that it would be best if I didn’t call so much, and didn’t visit much as she needed this quiet time for herself and the staff would make sure she was safe. I felt insulted at the time, but it WAS good advice that I followed in later hospitalizations. We set one time a day for phone calls or a visit, and that was it. Sometimes the call or visit didn’t happen either. Try to find some peace for yourself."

My mantra at times was I’m not the same as him, I won’t make the same mistakes as him, etc. In my prodrome I tried to be invisible, handle my own problems and hide, because I felt my parents had enough trouble dealing with him. But when I faced my own illness, I met it head-on with the help of parents better capable and educated to handle my challenges. The dream of caregivers and most parents is for their charges to become their own caregivers and take care of themselves. And I feel observing and struggling to contain and clean up after my brother’s manic episodes was a seed to more objective thinking about my illness and my behaviors and I was the better for it."

176268125,"I know the guilt can be huge. Our son abused drugs and alcohol for a year when we were trying to figure out what was going on. We even had to kick him out of our home at that time which caused a lot of guilt but we were doing what we thought best at the time. He used to be on risperidone but has been very stable on Invega injection once a month for the past 2 years. I feel pacing is part of both meds and schizophrenia. It is calming in some ways. Propranolol helps for some to calm that restlessness. Don’t give up on his future, our son takes one college class at a time. It really helps self esteem and gives him a goal and hope.

It’s funny, your post reminded me that my father was NEVER happy with me, up until he died. He disapproved of almost every life choice I made and let me know, for decades. He couldn’t tolerate me as a smart sane person, heaven knows how he would have acted if I’d been disabled in some way. Help when I needed it, and good wishes and approval when I didn’t need help, were all I ever wanted. It is funny to look back and see his bitterness so clearly right now."

176268137,Morning _AT_MENTION_-Cotton how’s it going?
176268138,"@ Cat Nip Our son had terrible mood swings before he was consistently medicated with injectable. Before the injectable he was on and off meds for a few years. We lived in fear and it was like walking on egg shells. I learned in _USER_ID_ Family to family that it takes 1-2 years for the brain to fully recover from psychosis which helped me put my expectations in line with a marathon, not a sprint. When our son was first medicated with injectable we saw tiny improvements each week, major improvements monthly and much less lability at 6 months. Stress, fatigue, or change seemed to increase mood swings especially early on in journey from florid psychosis to his new normal (recovery). Enjoy the good moments, eventually you will have more in a row and for longer periods of time if his meds work for him. Over time ( a few years) I shifted my thinking. I let go of worrying about what is next, when will this end, and when is the next crisis??? This shift made a world of difference for me and my well being. 
I realized that when I lived in a constant state of worry and questions… I missed the joy in the good moments."

176268140,The social piece is hard. It seemed to drain all the energy out of my daughter. It has gotten much better over the years. I wish your son well. Give the clozapine time. You’ll see gradual improvements.
176268141,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ , did you go to the psychiatrist?"
176268142,I’ll be holding good thoughts for you. It’s very important to have a good living situation. I hope you find something soon.
176268143,A few attempts throughout my life. Last one nearly worked. That was almost 3 years ago. Spent two weeks in the regular hospital and 7 weeks in the psych hospital. Had so many injections in my belly for fear of blood clots. Wasn’t really conscious the first few days. Not sure how I feel about the whole thing. I guess I’m glad I didn’t die for my kids sakes. They have no idea what I did.
176268144,"I have similar troubles with a sibling who has bipolar disorder. He often embellishes and needlessly aggrandizes and intellectualizes things. He also has a tendency to live in the past. He often repeats stories and themes with slight variations, and since I’ve heard much of it before I can follow it as a sort of shorthand. Since I know him, I’m able to question some of the more outlandish and seemingly incomprehensible stuff, because I’m aware that there’s always some tenuous idiosyncratic thread of references he’s making-- and he seems unaware that most people can’t follow, because they don’t have the same working set of trivial or non trivial knowledge. In some ways the repetition helps, because occasionally I can get a word in edgewise and uncover the background of his more cryptic connections. It’s especially bad when he’s been drinking. But even when he’s sober his ramblings resemble stories a drunk or stoner might tell."
176268145,"my son has been in several drug rehab. They don’t work for sz. That is just a money making machine. No matter how many times we told the rehabs that he has a mental issue and to cope he was drinking, they don’t listen. They say they have experience dealing with the mental issues, but they don’t. Just pay your money and they will give him a bed until the insurance doesn’t want to pay any more. Not a single one of them ever diagnosed him with sz! In fact, they would take him off the meds that he was on and he would get out and we would have to start all over again."

176268150,"The problem was that the drug caused unacceptable adverse effects in the other organs. This time they found a antidote that does not cross brain blood barrier. So the antidote works only outside the brain, the antipsychotic drug works on the brain. So it took several decades to find the combination."
176268151,"All good points on you all. I can’t help but also consider the test group itself and if I’m reading it correctly it’s from ‘07? How much have we learned since and if these were diagnosed schizophrenic, what type? Am I correct in understanding that just in the last few years this idea of basic sub-types structure has itself been reconstructed? It seems to me we’ve been seeing an influx of contributors in this site alone amongst family and caregivers where loved ones are getting diagnosed with a one-off psychotic episode. Is this standard now for diagnostic procedure? I remember just 10 years ago that it was standard to take a long while of observation over an ongoing period and hash through multiple other potential diagnosis for exhibited symptoms to fully determine a schizophrenic diagnosis. Often over a period of no less than a couple years. Thus, I question the study group and their credible ‘diagnosis’ first. Since, as we all know, it appears every case presents significantly diffe
rent both in form and intensity. Duration since onset? Another factor. As far as the efficacy of antipsychotic meds, either first or second generation, we KNOW the side effects are often brutal and all can be detrimental to the body over extended durations. How are we gauging the efficacy in this particular group? As in, are we looking at a specific and common symptom to all subjects, and working on the assumption they’re all of the same initial level of functioning? What’s the baseline for ‘standard’ neurological functioning, and if so, what is it? Neuro imaging? IS there one presented even? Given the duration of the study, I find myself in the end, again, not questioning wether the meds work or not, are necessary for long term prevention or not, but wether the diagnostic system is sound or not. Yes, in my humble opinion also, mental illness is an entirely complicated area of study, and difficult to observe in full with all contributing factors in consideration."
176268152,She might have hid that she was German . Her last name sounds polish though. There’s rumors in my family that her father was polish but her mother was definately German and born there.

176268154,"So sorry you are going through this. My wife and I have been dealing with my sons diagnosis for ten plus years it has gotten better in many ways but its still a stressful daily emotional struggle. Depending on your location maybe you can get some help from social services in your community. Just letting them know about your daughter, her condition and your grandson might help if she does need help. Letting them know about your concerns may help to pave the way if some form of intervention is needed. Is she taking her medications ? if not that might be the first thing to work on to get her stabilized. Hang in there I know how hard this is to deal with ."

176268156,"I didn’t take pills well when I was young, I immediately learned though when I had to. Its odd how quickly I learned. Still no. I do not like being stuck needing to network with prescribers, and the pharamacy when a problem occurs with getting a refill. I’ve had to have sudden pharmacy shifts with little medicine on hand to others who had a supply. Its just an inconvenience the only thing that humbles me is that many people are in the same situation regardless of mental health. We can all be screwed by having some unhealthy body part or organ."

176268158,"_AT_MENTION_, That is a very difficult situation, I feel for you. For the timebeing, while he is still under your roof, you could try a few things. Obviously trying to engage in conversation is likely not going to lead anywhere, so I suggest you try and get him involved in other ways. The fact that he left the rental to come to your home, means something. He chose it, after all, I’m assuming? Meal times are an important family opportunity. Even if he isn’t up to joining in discussion, you could ask him to help out — either by setting the table (or clearing afterwards), or by helping in the preparation of the food (scrubbing vegetables, or whatever). This will give him a sense of accomplishment, feeling needed and some necessary routine. It’s worth a try. Baby steps. Everyone has to eat, so might as well start there. Regardless of ones mental state, proper nutrition and companionship, is something we all crave and can appreciate and does wonders for our soul. Good luck, and let us know how y
ou get on."
176268159,"interesting, I would not give it to a violent SZ… The opium poppy was cultivated in lower Mesopotamia as long ago as 3400 BC. The chemical analysis of opium in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to the alkaloids codeine and morphine. Diamorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by _PERSON_], an English chemist working at St. _NAME_’s Hospital Medical School in London who had been experimenting combining morphine with various acids. He boiled anhydrous morphine alkaloid with [acetic anhydride for several hours and produced a more potent, form of morphine which is now called diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate . In 1895, the German drug company Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug. Bayer_Heroin_bottle.jpg539×790 108 KB"

176268161,No! I feel the same with or without them. Voices and my cracked brain is all the symptoms I have. You? Do they affect you mood?
176268162,"Oh, as you know from caring for your mother, yes, resilience and coping skills must be learned by caregivers. It’s like a boxing match, getting knocked down and getting back up and keeping on keeping on. Until one day the crisis is over, and there is some peace."
176268163,She means anti depressant.
176268164,"Oh no! That is my biggest fear. I try to put my blinders on and just look at the task in front of me, otherwise I’ll have a panic attack or have a nervous breakdown! I am praying for your family especially your son."
176268165,Exactly!!! It’s such a sad life.

176268167,"Thanks everyone. He is currently in a step down crisis center. I’ve talked to the caseworkers there, and told them that he cannot come home. It’s so hard, I just want to hug him and take him home - but I know it’s not good for him. - or me. Thanks so much for all your input, it is very helpful - and gives me hope."

176268170,"I always tell my story when I see stuff about racism. Because I hope someone will see it and change, too. I used to be racist. Like in the KKK racist. But, after I left my hometown and state, met more and different people, and listened to their stories, I changed. Getting to know people as people, not as some type of “them” which is saying “other” opens your eyes. Today I am the proud aunt to biracial kids, sister in law to biracial guys, and a strong ally to anyone regardless of race. If I can change like that, anyone can. It’s a matter of being exposed to as much different people and seeing them as people. And an open mind willing to learn."
176268171,"Such a great report, Maggotbrane! Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences. Where I receive care they always tell me…I can check myself into the hospital if I feel I need it. It made me curious."
176268172,"Just try to control your actions, like me, I still think wrongly but don’t act on my every impulse because I know I am not gonna come out of it good. And you always land before you gonna relapse again so you just have to wait it out."
176268173,"Yeah, it is a risk. You never know if you are going to relapse. But like I said, lifelong drugs is not something you want to endure if you don’t have to. I’m stuck with lifelong drugs almost certainly because I’m schizophrenic. You may not have to be. I dunno, it’s your decision but I would try it, under your doctors supervision of course, where a relapse will hopefully be picked up upon quickly and corrected if it were to occur."

176268176,_AT_MENTION_ My son is now on court-order meds (third time - which I hope it works) to get him to recovery. I am happy to read that your daughter’s court-ordered meds led to her recovery; this gives me hope for my son.
176268177,"In my personal experience, my ex husband (full insight, paranoid type schizophrenic, heard voices, would literally ask on occasion if I, the clerk, or if there was somebody in the house, had said something, checking himself, then declare that it must be ‘time to take a pill’ [clozapine]…’” after my soft answer was always ‘no… there’s nobody here but you and I… he’d get himself a pill and take it… Fast forward… he is successful in career and life with his wife (she a second marriage with four or five children… god bless them all ) Then… Me with my current partner… 10+ . Zero insight. (Not paranoid type. SZA) When he’d have episodes or ‘tantrums’ it was absolutely no use to try and tell him otherwise (obviously, tried and true. Dimentiated patients of mine were similar. I come in with a ham sandwich and crackers and they scream ‘ I don’t eat that shit!!’ Then… I take it away and turn my back, cut it diagonally, come back and present it spread out on a plate 
and only give a single or two crackers displayed easy and uncomplicated… “HOW’D you KNOW?!? This my FAVorite!! ) So, back to… after years of me describing to him, my current partner’s ‘choices’ became just slightly different that one night when, looking him in the eye after he’d busted mine out completely and I was sifting blood out of my orbital… I calmly kept and held pressure and whiped…quick butterfly and saying THIS is exactly the behavior I have been talking to you about. It is EXACTLY as I described. please LOOK at the clock… you’ve been by yourself for X# of hours… nobody and nothing is actually happening to you. It’s ok… he looked at the clock and apparently that one day, at that time, in that moment, he SAW and understood to a very small degree… blood spilling down and coating my face as I calmly talked…) in that moment … insight. And then he never had it again. Insight. It’s a funny thing honestly. When we talk here in this forum about ‘insight’, it’s not 
the same as you or I or many other folks might consider as ‘personal insight’. It’s an entirely different condition. It is very literally the inability to see disease in ones own body. The brain will not process this. An example would be that somebody that lost their physical and literal legs. But that somebody keeps trying to get up out of bed and walk, and gets angry, and somehow they keep ending up on the floor and it’s Your fault that their elbow is bruised and their hip is sore where they just landed on it. Anosognosia. Delusions are, as we see them, as family and caregivers, full on beliefs in alternate realities. How many of you are bare foot right now? If I told you, you certainly are NOT and you have shoes on your feet, would you believe me? Does it actually benefit any of us to tell you otherwise? How? Leave the shoes out, not in the closet maybe, where they can be seen?"
176268178,"Also a good point, _AT_MENTION_"
176268179,"After the initial year with injected medication, his insight did not improve. He developed empathy, delusions/hallucinations went away and everything else in his life improved, except the insight and his ability to work. It was 4 years later when he was on round two of medication, same medication shot first dose then he switched to pills. But he took it for 6-9 months before insight started to develop. He also turned 25 years old, so I’m not sure if it was length of time on medication, experience/realizing correlation of off meds=hospitalization, or the fact he turned 25 years old (which is when male brains reach maturity). Probably a combination of all three."
176268180,Sorry for not being thrilled about your gay jokes. That must be really offensive for you.
176268181,Congratulations. That is a huge accomplishment. It must be a big relief to move to a better neighborhood. Best of luck on continued success
176268182,It makes sense. You’re stressed about your affliction so you self-medicate through drugs or alcohol. I smoke and like cold beer. I’m part of that 3 quarters in the study.
176268183,"Thanks so much GSSP. I think I WILL be looking at cheap local hotels to go stay. Money is too tight to have issues with it, thankfully. haha… He is on disability and many of our bills are automatically withdrawn from the account. That makes it nice financially anyway. He does drive which terrifies me but I make sure I am available any time he wants to and then I ask if I can come along. He knows I always drive if I’m in the car so he drives…only when he is the only one able. He does smoke and shop on his own. For our first 2 years it was difficult to tell he had any problems…but then when his meds were changed it all got destroyed. I can see this forum will help give me sanity again and I really appreciate you responding. I can’t tell you how refreshing it is just to have contact with others who struggle too… <3"

176268210,"Oh I am so thrilled to hear your good news! It gave me goose bumps to read your post and I am smiling now for you both. Yes, the correct medicine or combination can make all the difference. If he can see that he needs to be on medication, that is an extra bonus for sure, as so many with this illness still don’t see that they NEED the medication. I doubt that my daughter would continue her shot if I didn’t take her there every month. I know she NEEDS it, and for now, that is enough for us. I hope your husband continues to do well on Invega. There are regular improvements over time for my daughter. Good for you for finding a way to tell your husband about your petition too. That is probably a weight off your mind."
176268211,I believe my fiancée’s trying to take my money and that she’s cheating on me and that she doesn’t love me. And that I might get tortured. My family says I’m wrong. But I’m pretty sure I’m not sz.
176268212,"Risperidone stops your positive symptoms like delusions, hallucinations. However, it may exacerbate some negative symptoms. It also induces a lot of weight gain like 30 lb or more,makes you tired, lose sex drive but it’s the same side effects for all antipsychotics currently. It may cause muscle spasms or metabolic syndrome that ????? up your system permanently"
176268213,"My daughter is fully medication compliant now after being force hospitalized, force medicated and court ordered to stay on meds. When the court order was over, she stayed on meds. Not because she agreed she is ill. She never agreed she is ill, and still doesn’t think she is ill. With LEAP, I was able to determine that having a job was important to her. Over a 3 year period, I helped her to get 5 jobs. She lost every one due to acting too crazy at some point or another while on the job as she wouldn’t stay on medicine despite 4 hospitalizations. However, while on the court ordered shot, after her 5th hospitalization, I got her another job. She did well on the job. She kept getting the shots. When the court order ended, I reminded her that the shot was helping her to keep her job, helping her to stay out of the hospital. It’s weird, she knows she isn’t ill, but she takes the shot because she likes working and doesn’t like the hospital. It makes sense to her. So we have an agreement that she 
can live with me as long as she tries to work, and that the shot helps her work, so she gets her shot. It’s 10 months of sanity now."
176268214,I am so so sorry…I am new to this forum as we are 18 mos into this diagnosis…yet I just want to say I feel your pain and see your heart exploding yet again. Sending big hugs your way ! (and your cat is super cute Our kitties are our light through this dark time in our lives

176268221,"This sounds like an extension of Anosognosia, I would think the LEAP method may apply here. This can take a significant amount of time, and it may not solve your problem soon enough, or that time might be better spent getting him to seek medication. That’s likely why you are getting this response. You’ve started the process by listening to why he moves the rocks and bricks. Can you expand on how this makes him think and feel? That might lead to building empathy, and coming up with a way to agree and partner with him. You mention shopping being a motivator for him, is there any way you can tie this to your desired behavior for him? Some sort of deal where he only gets shopping money if he doesn’t move rocks and bricks, or something similar?"
176268222,"Hi Hope you all are doing well. It’s that time again where I feel alone and sad. My sister has been saying things that don’t exist such as “Corrupt police use a device called green monster where they hack someone’s social media or device and blank the person using it which causes them to see things or become unable to do things.” she’s constantly changing the story about things and constantly makes up something new after a previous story wears off. She’s always thinking someone is hacking her cell phone and it’s changing her number all the time or create new accounts frequently. this is so sad and I just don’t understand this terrible illness. Another thing, if I don’t act a certain way she starts to talk to her self out loud and says I’m not her sister, one day I am and another I’m not it’s very confusing."
176268223,I’d appeal. They make mistakes sometimes.
176268224,10mg This has been a game changer for us! We are very happy at the moment . We will attempt to get therapy going and attempt to get all the coping skills someone with autism would benefit from Like social therapy and behavioral therapy as well. At this point we can say things are completely stable for the time being We just have to address the more physical issues like neuropathy . We are happy at this level for now perhaps We will be considering switching over to a low side effect profile medication in the future. since new meds are coming out.
176268225,"Thank you for the response. The worst case scenario you pose seems reasonable to consider, but also doesn’t seem likely. She’s never acted out. She has gotten in trouble even once at school. I’ve rarely even had to discipline her at home her entire life. She has good relationships with friends and classmates and always has. She says the hallucinations are not escalating, but that in her teen years she has developed more of an awareness as to the differences in perception between hers and “normal” people. Since she has no memory of not experiencing these things, she has no basis for comparison. She does know which things are not real typically, and figured it was just something one had to learn to ignore."
176268226,"Thanks a lot for that, _NAME_."
176268227,How did you find a case worker to check on him? My son lives independently and works but not sure he is fully med compliant. He also abuses drugs.
176268228,I don’t understand _AT_MENTION_
176268229,Oh my God! I have almost the same issue with my 25 year old son. He lives with us though. He sleeps all day and is up all night strumming on his guitar or playing his video games too. His room is a mess. I try not to do everything for him but it’s hard to live with it. He has no friends other than the ones in his head. (Who he talks to all the time…) I can’t image if he lived in his own place. We have to lock up his meds and take him to his monthly doctors appointments. He has no job. The only advise is to be there for him so he doesn’t think he’s alone or no one cares. It’s too easy for my son to get sucked into the voices in his head. It’s unbelievable to know there is so many people in the same boat I am…
176268230,"It is a low dose. This is why I am wondering, could it be Ziprasidone. Before Ziprasidone, it was fine. I also take Abilify which lowers my prolactin. My prolactin is 0.7. It is extremely low."

176268236,"It all sounds so familiar minus the drinking. Stages, screaming at the top of his lungs. I wish that he would get laryngitis. Music is constantly on and very loud all hours and my neighbors are elderly but have known me for years and they haven’t complained as of yet. I try so very hard to not listen to all of the filthy nasty things he says but all day is a lot. I have to leave to get any peace. I have called 911 and they talk to him, he calms down a little then the next day it starts again. The psych emergency departments in my area can’t keep them for more than 25 - 48 hours or medicate because of COVID. I am at my waist end. Right now hes not capable of taking care of himself!"
176268237,"I actually had bloodwork taken at about 3.5 months in showing no abnormalities and I can remember conversations and events from a month ago. My story does not mirror the story of myriad others; however, many recover and you will see a trend that they are content, because they are recovering. The horror stories are alarming and made me realize even the worst of my symptoms paled in comparison to issues like Tardive Dyskinesia or Parkinson’s Disease."
176268238,"My friend, I don’t understand your reasoning. My partner called them racist because of the things they told her for dating me. It honestly bothered her more than it did me. I’m currently in undergrad with plans to go to med school, so at the very least I have no doubt in my worth. Secondly, how am I destroying their family life by urging them to get proper help for their sick daughter? As someone with schizophrenia, or the like, you should very well know that it isn’t an illness that gets magically better if you ignore it. You’re too focused on them being racist. Lastly, you know it’s possible for people to give family members a home and food and still not care for them properly, right? I mean yeah she may not be homeless, but damn. That can’t be the standard for if someone is actually cared for or not. My main concern is the complete well being of my ex-partner. I am concerned with more than her just having a place to sleep, food, and clean clothes, man. I don’t understand why any of 
this is a problem for you. I really don’t understand you man."
176268239,"I would say to be careful of your choices and dont do anything stupid/impulsive. Ive had days where I have lots of social energy (for once) that could be all you are having, or it could be start of mania… Hard to say."
176268240,"That’s interesting. Schizophrenia is such a broad spectrum, there must be some people for whom this would be good. Throwing my son into regular school wasn’t good, but maybe it was because he was on totally wrong medication. I think the social skills training would be fantastic."

First it was ADHD around the age of 9/10, then ADHD with ODD, then bipolar, bipolar w/schizoaffective and finally schizophrenia around the age of 27. Because I had records out the ying/yang, I had no problems giving them the documentation they wanted. And because he was disabled as young as he was, I have been able to continue him on my family plan which covers deductibles and drug prescriptions. He is covered under Medicare and my health insurance plan for life under a state and federal statute as an adult disabled child."

176268247,I did that last year but also failed. Sounds like things got to crisis before something was done - almost all too often the way Hope you’re in a better place now

176268249,"I’ve been feeling resentful due to fallout of relationship. I mean, I have to accept the reality that I’ll be by myself mostly."
176268250,Today I kind of failed & didn't follow through with promises to myself. So I'm naturally feeling disappointed in myself & feeling sad. I can't blame it all on the voices. I thought I was so determined this morning; I was so sure I would succeed & be proud of myself. But none of my goals got fulfilled today. All I can do now is accept my self defeat & try again tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

So I'll drink that in the morning ^-; Also I need to stop smoking CBD weed but it's addictive cuz it helps me sit still."

176268254,"D-serine for Schizophrenia D-serine is an amino acid that can be made in the body. It plays a role in metabolism, and acts as a “helper” molecule to open receptors (“gates” across cell walls) in the brain. Having the “gate” open makes a brain cell more likely to become active. It is thought that D-serine may therefore have a role in memory"

176268257,"It does cause cognitive impairment, but supplementing seems to help a lot in my case. I am on 5mg."
176268258,"The key to leap is to keep it simple: Listen: Your daughter feels the diagnosis is incorrect. Empathize: You understand how she could be upset. You would be upset if someone invalidated your information also. Agree: You agree with her, you were disappointed in the way the psychiatrist addressed your daughter also. Plan: That is for the 2 of you to work out. New psychiatrist? Trying to get the current psychiatrist to not invalidate your daughter? What possible help could a psychiatrist give your daughter? Your plan is YOUR plan, so you have to work it out. My daughter STILL does not agree that she has had hallucinations or delusions. Her psychiatrist was stupid last session and asked her if she was “still hearing things that weren’t real”? which upset my daughter. I am going to write a letter to the Dr. before the next appt and tell her that she CANNOT invalidate my daughter’s opinion that she is gifted and her voices are special beings in the sky. The goal is to help my daughter, not to cru
sh her. The goal is to keep her on the medication that works… For your daughter, it seems the goal would be to help her get her meds adjusted so she feels better… or whatever wording you like. My heart hurts that your daughter was hurt emotionally by the Dr’s irrational demands."

176268274,I have to say here that I don’t know. DID is not sz. Rationalization doesn’t always work. Be her friend I guess. Don’t try to save her. Encourage her to see a dr and get medication if she can

176268277,Glad to hear it _AT_MENTION_
176268278,"Oh _AT_MENTION_ I truly understand how hard this terrible illness is on family members. When I took in my daughter to live with me, I didn’t really know the first thing about mental illness. I was very unsympathetic and had many wrong ideas. It took years to teach me and make me understand that she wasn’t behaving in these strange fashions because she wanted to, but because she had to. My daughter has a brain malformation which we didn’t know about when she was “well” (partial agenesis of the corpus collossum) which sometimes can apparently lead to schizophrenia. Perhaps epilepsy can also lead to mental illness. Whatever the cause of it, the cure for it doesn’t exist, and the struggle to control it is something I never could have imagined. I hope that you can find some ways to be kind to yourself and give yourself some “happiness” breaks. When my daughter was psychotic and unmedicated, I needed breaks for my own well being. You MUST find some “me” time while trying to cope with 
her illness. I wish you the best in working through this."
176268279,"I am so sorry _NAME_. I worry that someone will fall in love with my son and have to suffer the sadness that can be a part of loving someone who has unmedicated schizophrenia. You sound as though you understand that his negative thoughts towards you are a result of his psychosis. As you are seeing, its all just as real to him as though it was real. I am so sorry that he stopped taking his meds. While others may feel differently, I think its best that you move on with your own life. I am so sorry that you feel alone. You made a difficult decision for yourself, it will get easier. If you had been involved with my son, I would wish you all the best in life going forward. Take care of yourself and find your future in life’s journey."
176268280,"Why? (Meth wasn’t my amphetamine of choice, but I’m still curious) Thanks. And that’s the hope!"
176268281,"Everyone is afraid of that they don’t understand Unfortunately the media paints us very badly, and campaigners like to just focus on anxiety and depression - and ignore psychotic disorders"
176268282,"Hi Mahwah, It’s a disgrace the VA doesn’t take better care of our veterans. Being in the service might have triggered the schizophrenia from the extreme levels of stress. I also live in Illinois- northwest suburb of Chicago. Any private place is beyond affordable. When my son was in the residential center, it was in the northeast part of Chicago. The name of the place is Bryn Mawr Care and their number is _PHONE_NO_. They take Medicaid. The building is old, but clean. His caseworker was great! There is an intake social worker who interviews the individual and decides if it is a good fit. He went from the hospital straight to there. I know it is sometimes easier to get into a place coming straight from the hospital, but they do take people who are not currently being hospitalized. I don’t know if you can get your son to come back to Illinois, but it might be worth a call to _NAME_ to see if they have any suggestions/recommendations. It must be so hard having your son so far away. I m sorry for 
the pain and sadness you are going through. My thoughts are with you."
176268283,"It seems that you are doing the best you can, all of you. It’s so great that your son saw you on your birthday AND got you a groupon for a massage. Wow, that is soooo thoughtful. And your husband is talking about the illness more, it takes awhile to get the seriousness of it for some family members. It took my sons years to accept their sister’s illness. My daughter is doing very well, our new normal is actually quite acceptable to both of us. Her paranoia is totally gone now and she is my best date for movies, the gym, restaurants, etc. Thank you for asking."

176268287,Where would you go? With your mother?
176268288,See Pdoc tomorrow virtually. I suppose I should tell him about hallucinations/delusions. I did move the appointment up a month. I feel dumb now though. Like I should have just left it in July.
176268289,Is it safe Are there side effect if so what are they
176268290,"Using the same logic, I’m not telling you to change. I’m pointing out the absurdity. But even that is wrong."

176268294,Just to clarify on the dog…I think that while she was committed the dog was taken somewhere and the work on the teeth was done at that time…just me putting the pieces of the puzzle together in a somewhat logical manner. Someone would have had to kept the dog till she was released.

176268296,"Hi _PERSON_, thank you so much for sharing! Your insight is helpful and seems sound. I’m curious, have you ever worked with a therapist and used CBT (cognitive behavior therapy)? It sounds as if you’re using some of the techniques to identify when you are suffering delusions and to work through them and I’m just wondering if those are self-taught through life experience or like I said learned from CBT as well. My partner suffers anosognosia and shuts down at even the slightest suggestion of a therapist but I’ve been trying for years to teach him the techniques passively myself. It’s really great to hear your story and I appreciate your contribution here! Please keep sharing"
176268297,"I quit my AD about 8 years ago (I think), other than horrible withdrawal effects that lasted for about 3 months I am glad I went off it. I decided to quit because I didn’t feel depressed anymore. After I quit and the withdrawal was over I was fine. Good luck!"

176268299,"I’m sorry this has/is happening to you. I myself have been in more than one emotionally abusive and violent relationships. It’s really tough. I remember for me it was hard to leave cause I loved them and they would be good for a while and it would happen again. Like they say above get some help and educate yourself on the subject of abuse, abusers act. Doing that myself has helped alot to understand what was going on and how to approach the situation differently then I would have without knowing."

176268307,"I’m so sorry…your family knows SMI all too well. This is why I try to be an advocate to help people…both those with a loved one with SMI and for those living with it, as well.

176268308,"First things first, you need to find a landlord or agency that is willing to accept housing benefit, and that is hard to find. My agency wants the hb paid directly to them from the council and I needed a a deposit and a months rent in advance too. They also needed a guarantor to be liable if rent isn’t paid in full (arrears) My housing benefit covers part of my rent and I have to pay a top up out of my benefits. My hb is £392 and my rent is £537 pm. If I didn’t get PIP then I wouldn’t be able to afford to live here. Once a year the landlord/agency puts the rent up. Housing benefit is frozen and has been since the crash. Good luck, you are going to need it!"
176268309,Thanks for this. Something to ask my GP about when I see him in a few months.
176268310,They keep it on all day long. So brainwashed. My moms like “I watch the liberal news too”. But she has never once put it on in all her years. That’s a lie. Maybe she put it once but she was disgusted and turned it off right away and considered it as “she watches it”. Lol.

176268314,I’ve gained like 3 pounds in under 2 weeks since going back on Depakote. My moods are better but maybe it’s because I’m getting more sleep now. Going to ask my doctor to get me off this med. I was going to remain on a low dose but now I want to try and manage my moods without a mood stabilizer. Hopefully Risperdal will be enough. Most of the mood stabilizers are big weight gainers. I need to watch out for my physical health too. Enough is enough.
176268315,"Well I don’t know of any video. However, with reality testing, I imagine you mean how to tell hallucinations and delusions from reality. You have to use the evidence of what’s around you and weigh them on a balance of probabilities. An example I personally do is, if I believe others are talking about me or constantly looking at me, I would actually look at the people around me to see what they are doing. Chances are, they are not looking at me or talking about me at all. You have to be able to calculate what’s the chance of people talking about me or looking at me constantly."

176268317,"Hi, ALL I do is worry all day about _PERSON_. She is still having a rough time from the side affects she was experiencing from the Vraylar. She’s on Seroquel now. She’s been really paranoid lately that cameras are on her and that she will get arrested for fighting. She’s Autistic as well. She’s never been in trouble in her life. I too get invited to lunch by my one best friend, I decline. I cannot leave her. She cant go out, doesnt want to. So I feel that guilt too, you are not alone. But I will say we need it. We need it to catch our breath and destress and have that reassurance, who ever it might be from that we are doing the best we can. With that said, I still cant go out and have a good time without my _PERSON_. Stay strong."

176268320,"Thank you, this has been a nightmare for many years now, I’m very hopeful."
176268321,Because you can’t stop haha maybe you’re just meant to be a poet. I write as well and even though I get no attention as an artist it almost doesn’t matter
176268322,"This may have evolved through my coping skills as a poet and writer. I used to have vivid dreams, lucid dreams, of spaceships and future worlds. By God, I had the first parallel dream in my life two nights ago- I was in the past, for once. Not the endless future of new tech. It was a woman who was pregnant and I was her, she was sobbing herself to sleep because she knew I was dreaming about her in the future. So I dont know, I know that some of my existential beliefs have become reality, or are possible because they were tangible–I recorded them, and uploaded them, confirmed them with others. Like electromagnetic telekinesis, the MIND BRAIN and how seizures and the sun relate to hypnotic time travel, which is how I met the Watcher at the Threshold. He wouldn’t leave me alone, always there—testing and tempting, but now I believe we have made peace. I pray he will forgive himself for his hollow pride. Anyways, the more I was possessed, the more I learned that I couldn’t simply let the white s
hapes and ghosts step all over me and they would cry out to me in nightmares of the apocalypse, or pandemic, or ice earth, or Brazil/Asia, or the other Planet I named _USER_ID_, etc. but I just come up with this, if I were God—I would be the author of my own existence, who am I to say that you cant write your own God-stpry. If I were God I would make everyone else able to be one too…but from the Watcher I realized that making others God is a terrible Gift and Responsibility and that though some of us have our power shaken and thoughts broken or pre-programmed annihilation, there is a Karma and law that prevents those that sow-rotten seeds to prosper, and they do not return out of love…because they dont love life. So I sometimes I can preform exorcisms, or miraculous healings, or change the weather, make it rain, or survive snow blizzards, or turn down the hurricane noise or static, maybe I can do the impossible as a glitch, mutation, virus, or adaptation, Maybe I simply chose to be this way. So if that
s crazy, guess Im crazy then and Im ok with that. I would rather be crazy for who i am than accepted for something I am not and never will be."
176268323,"My love one does have a debt card, doesn’t over use it which _PERSON_ thankful, we tried for 3 years to see doctor etc - now that he is medicated he went for his first physical with his GP and we were very happy does his blood work every 2 weeks which is great but not successful with dentist yet will continue to encourage him, never give up"
176268324,Thank you _AT_MENTION_
176268325,"The grief is heartbreaking. I feel for you and wish more support services/doctors could prepare parents for what they will go through. There’s not much out there that’s written about it either. As you said, it is like losing a child - except there is the child in front of you but now is someone you don’t recognize. Know you are not alone. It took me years to even name what I was feeling as grief. Each milestone my daughter missed was a new opportunity to mourn. It is so healthy that you can name what you are feeling as grief. Naming it helped me. In time, and with acceptance of my daughter’s condition, the grief began to ease. Slowly, I started to see my daughter come back to us as well. Probably not who she would have been, but working hard to be the best she can be."
176268326,That’s indeed a big breakfast !
176268327,My grandson was started on Clozapine in the hospital. They were able to bring him up quickly so withing 2 weeks he was at 300mg he went up to 500mg but now back down to 350mg. Its been great for him. He works fulltime now and has madea few friends
176268328,"I just bought my first house! I’m both excited and overwhelmed as is my sz son. Just wanted to share a bit of happy news.

176268329,_AT_MENTION_ i feel your pain. Just before starting your job we’re your symptoms light and you felt you could succeed? I thought I had it all together and would be able to work but everyone else doubted me. They were right but I said it’s better to try and fail rather than not try at all.
176268330,"I can relate this in part… this is why I was wondering about my own mental health as I was learning more about schizophrenia. I was noticing some of the negative symptoms in myself… some level of depression, social anxieties, etc. I just don’t have any of the positive symptoms… no hallucinations or delusions. Although my home was somewhat stable, I didn’t have the best relationship with my father. He was somewhat strict and he seemed somewhat hard on me because I was very argued a lot. It was always hard (and still is) for me to make friends. I do have ADHD and I have been learning that this can often have comorbidity with many of the negative symptoms of other mental illnesses. I a trying to maintain my ADHD naturally as much as I can because I don’t think we afford to have two people meeting with psychiatrists."
176268331,I feel like sh!t since yesterday bcz I got covid vaccine.
176268332,They’re hallucinations then. That’s a paranoid delusion. But you need to make a leap of faith and trust your doctors when they too tell you it’s not real. I wish I could help you as I hate to see you suffering like this.
176268333,"During today’s appointment with the psychiatrist our daughter was told by her specialist she has schizophrenia, totally despondent beyond words she replied “how can you say that to me everything I’m telling you is true my life IS IN DANGER” Psychiatrist said she will only believe her if by the next visit she gives her the answers and names of the people who have/ are harming her. It’s now on my shoulders as she’s cried and told/yelled at me she is not a schizophrenia not a schizo not a crazy person and to please believe her. “Mum you know everything is true that is happening to me” I quietly listened to her and have replied I will protect her, she is safe in our home. Can you please help me with the right words on this one, I have not read enough of Dr _PERSON_’s book to know how to properly confront this challenge in a peaceful and positive way. Thankyou in anticipation"
176268334,"I know it might be odd to feel this way, but it all doesn’t seem so sad anymore. Our son’s symptoms came on gradually over years. The years before we knew what was going on - those were some real worrisome parental years. Once we realized he had scz, we experienced some relief and got to add in a bunch of different worries:) There certainly wasn’t much on the good news side of it, but we finally had a direction to focus on moving forward. We eventually realized that our son would do better if he wasn’t living with us - just as he had kept trying to tell us. Every now and then someone would poke their head up on this forum and say “some of our kids do much better if they don’t live with us”. They are correct, for some of us, living with our adult children is not the best option. For other families, living together is an ideal option. -Wow- on your son’s strength and the attacks, while we have the strength and size issue here, we have been fortunate to not have to try to restrain our 
son. His form of schizophrenia makes him quite paranoid and fearful. The situations where he is a concern is where he becomes “cornered” - even though it can be a situation that is all delusion based - he has bought weapons several times when he became concerned that he needed to protect himself. Its with great sorrow that we acknowledge that we have to tell the police that he possibly has a weapon when they have been called to intervene. One of the really unique things about this forum is that you are never the worst situation, which is something that makes me really grateful. There is always a family with more family members with scz, additional medical issues and a history of severe tragedies. Always, always, there is someone here trying to keep more balls in the air than the rest of us. We have to deal with stuff that some families can never understand."
176268335,I meant to write being with someone that has schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder will make your life even more stressful and complicated than it already may be.
176268336,Its nice see my friends again.
176268337,There are many variants in Formal Thought Disorder. _NAME_ lists 20! https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/view/Johns_Hopkins_Psychiatry_Guide/787025/all/Thought_Disorder Our son had about 8 of these symptoms…Sometimes I could figure out why he used the words he did but overall his conversation had very little discernable meaning. I can’t be certain if the FTD came on as a result of repeated catatonia or too much ECT (ECT was helpful to him to a point especially because he refused all meds at the time). But the FTD disappeared entirely not long after he started on Clozapine.
176268338,Also had a gf before sz.
176268339,I am new to the Forum. I understand all the emotional pain I read about here. My daughter with Schizoaffective Disorder is 40 yrs old and it has been 16 years Recently I also encountered PsychCentral.com and have listened to Podcasts on Inside Schizophrenia with _NAME_ Star _PERSON_ and _NAME_. They have been a tremendous help. I’m gaining insight and practical advice.
176268340,Did you recover from sz? 2001 seems like a long time ago
176268341,That is an insanely high dose!!!

176268344,"Thank you _PERSON_, for sharing your story."
176268345,"Yes, my emotions are very blunted and I hate it"
176268346,Funny how all the people who desire the death of all humans never lead by example.
176268347,Thanks so much for taking the time to reply and share about your son. How wonderful to hear that he’s doing better! Gives me hope for my brother. Blessings to you and your family.
176268348,I've heard of it but haven't read it yet
176268349,"I used to think it was because it, the psychosis, went on for 8 to 9 months first time, with another two months of residual hallucinations, then I also relapsed when tried coming off meds but they say cos I’m on low dose of meds atm, it is not sz…"
176268350,"It is constant, yes. It’s so hard to even look at pictures of him at say age four, then age ten playing with friends, thoughts of him as a smiling baby, a beautiful happy child. I can’t accept he will be so alone! Whyyyy???"
176268351,"Yes I agree, which is why we are decreasing the CBD significantly. From 1000mg to 300mg. When this first happened she was do wound up that when the olanzapine didn’t do anything except at night (from 3-4 hours to 4-5)we opted to try the CBD to just help her sleep. We knew she couldn’t possibly begin to heal without sleep. At the 300mg she began sleeping between 8-10 hours. We believe this is her ""good level’ as the 1000mg calmed her a bit more and helped with agitation but the delusions were still present. That’s why husband and I have decided to try and go through the APs now that she’s resting well and back down to a more reasonable level of CBD. I don’t want to chase down every possibility like chasing after the wind. Thank you for your insightful post. I really appreciate it."
176268352,_AT_MENTION_ Sorry to hear that. Maybe searching for an alternative volunteering than what you previously did is better. There is too much pressure when working for paid employment.
176268353,thats the definition of psychosis: “a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality.” You lost contact with external reality. You thought demons were after you for goodness sake.
176268354,Air Boat Initial Test Fail
176268355,Wow!! You did a very good job. Very professional. I like how you incorporated the garden into it.
176268356,I think that my current psychiatrist is getting fed up with me. She probably feels that I’m demanding lately. I’m really just watching out for myself.
176268357,"this is a report you’re making. makes sense, I do this too. what’s the flip side?"
176268358,A few errands. Maybe either go to the park or maybe my sisters house. Maybe try to figure out my new at-home blood pressure machine.
176268359,"I would describe psychosis and schizophrenia, in a single word, as “Surreal”. If you are looking for a wild crazy time it’s a 5 star experience. The _USER_ID_ is awful and the meds in the past have been awful, with side effects or ineffectiveness. From that point of view it’s been a 1 star experience. Now that I am on a med that works 100% without side effects, things are better than they have ever been psychologically and since I lost almost 70lbs after switching AP’s my physical health and my blood work are much better. My only problem now is insomnia but I am making progress with a cocktail of drugs and supplements and am sleeping better."
176268360,"Welcome Wantto… You are still young and your relationship has not progressed to the point where you are living together, have children or where he is solely dependent on you. Ask yourself these important questions now: Am I willing to put everything in my life aside to take care of this man if his family stops supporting him? Do I have the funds to do this? Am I willing to be subjected to more anger and paranoia? How much am I willing to sacrifice in my life to be with this man? I have been through this myself in a marriage. If someone had given me advice early in the relationship, I would have chosen to remain friends with the man and help him however I could but would not have become as involved. My husband is also unmedicated, uses street drugs/alcohol to cope and only got worse in the years after he quit medication. Trying to maintain the relationship with him has been the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life. If you still want to help him, please focus on yourself first. Work on 
your life, your career and your future. If you are doing well, you will also be in a good place to help him if you want to do that. Just don’t let him drag you down. I hope this advice helps."
176268361,And yes I did get the cabinet screws put together
176268362,"I hear you! My husband is a lot more functional than yours, but still quite prone to paranoia about me, so I am walking on eggshells all the time. It is exhausting. I’ve been thinking about what I need for 2020 and whether my staying in the house is helping at this point vs. just prolonging an untenable long-term situation. Because his family lives quite far away, there is no one but me to buy him food etc. as he is housebound with delusions/paranoia and I am starting to wonder whether my presence is making it too easy for my husband, his family and his psychiatrist to persist in this very long course of passive waiting for things to somehow get better."
176268363,I’m in ACT. I’ve been doing it since 2018. I get two calls a week and go to two groups a week - CBT and Wellness.
176268364,"My doctor prescribed me 2mg of clonazepam for sleep today. He says to stay on that dose for a week while it gets into my system then to try and lower it to 1mg or even 0.5mg and see if I can sleep on a smaller dose. In any event I’m going to become a benzo junkie, lol …I probably won’t be laughing a year from now when I am dependent on it, but I’ve been dependent on it before so I know what I am getting into. And at this point I just want to sleep, I’ve been an insomniac for months now and I can’t stand it anymore. It’s so bad I had to cut down to 1 shift per week at work."
176268365,"Hey _PERSON_ , _PERSON_ that , he will allow himself a shot glass and drink half of it , its crazy . Every day i ask him if he wants ice cream and he says ‘its not good for me’ but last week when i asked he said yes shockingly so we went to buy some and he ate such a small portion and i could see he looked almost guilty having it . His Psychiatrist says its OCD and wanted to give him an SSRI but he refused and said its not good for him . I don’t know what else to do ."

176268375,"Well, when I lived in the studio with just me and my cat, every morning when I first opened my eyes he would be sitting a few inches away from me purring. That son-of-a-gun really liked me. I would wake up feeling pretty good; all bright and bushy tailed and then the thought always came: “Oh yeah, you got schizophrenia” and it would put a pall on my morning, as if a dark cloud was passing overhead blocking out the sun. It was still fun often living on my own though."
176268376,I’m so sad. I thought it would be different for a parent vs a spouse. It’s the same pain and hard to get them healthy.

I mean obvi it won’t be the same without my mom and sis but I’m sure at some point in the future it’ll feel ok again. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk

176268380,Ugh i hate my life
176268381,Yes my grandson was schizoaffective bipolar type. Heavy drug user. No meds worked until he was on Clozapine. I had to fight to get him on it. He was hospitalized for 2 weeks so he could ve brought up quickly. And you could see a difference in 5 days. His voices were reduce by 95 percent. Its been almost 5 years and he is doing very well. He is clean and holds a hoid fulltime job. Clozapine was a miracle drug for him.
176268382,I’m sorry to hear that _PERSON_. Hopefully you will get more use to it. Or maybe they will be able to switch you to less sedating drugs eventually. I was on Invega to get me stable but was able to switch to only a low dose of abilify after awhile. It’s much less sedating IMO.
176268383,Weakness doesn’t cause SZ. Please stop perpetuating this.
176268384,"I’m feeling sad tonight. This mental illness my son has is sad, seems I’ll never feel truly happy again. He’s now 33 and still doing nothing. He just wanders around the house. He comes alive a few short moments most days but then back to being flat and has no interest in anything. I can’t be responsible for his happiness, as much as I wish I could wash away this schizophrenia, this robber of my son’s life. It’s been seven years since he was diagnosed."

176268386,I’m megadosing daily vitamin d3 100k with vitamin k2mk7. I was able to quiet down my voices almost 100% and have steady pulse rate without anxiety.
176268387,"Your absolutely right ! i’m overthinking again and driving myself mad . I just need to trust his doctor and see what he and my son decide , all i know for now is that he won’t try any other meds as the last two he tried were a disaster . I will just wait and see on his next session . Thank you !"
176268388,Call your psychiatrist immediately.
176268389,Call the hospital and ask about visiting hours. I wouldn’t wait for them to call you. You will feel better once you see her. And can better assess the situation.
176268390,"but if Risperdal is causing the lethargy, that is hardly the solution?"
176268391,Thank you for sharing- I needed to hear this right now. When I look at my 31 year old sz son I still see all the potential “if only” . I hope He lives with what is… now I have to let go of “could have been”.
176268392,"Haven’t completed it yet but have researched it in Texas. He’s 19 and very capable when MED compliant. But that’s a big *when/if!! Several ‘experts’ said ‘Get guardianship!’. Which raised my anxiety although who knew that was possible when my anxiety persists at a constant DEFCON 8. Anyway, my research indicated that it would be a MAJOR PITA to secure and keep legal guardianship. It appeared to include constant, at least annual, ‘refreshing’, and seemed, to me, not to be worth the pain. I’d love to hear from some more experienced to see if the process is worthwhile. Thanks for posting."
176268393,"First, no I don’t think pushing him to go a hospital will help if he’s already getting treatment. It’s rare to self-admit without some intervention of mental health professionals or law enforcement. Second, I’m not sure of the necessity of hospitalization in this case. While it can be a safer environment to try out different medications, he could do the same in an outpatient environment so long as he’s not a threat to himself and others. While you say you find his paranoia unsafe, you seem able to restrict his access to yourself and your children. It’s unclear that you have sufficient grounds or the will to have him committed, in certain states court-assisted mental health treatment may direct treatment as a diversion from incarceration. Long lasting injectable medications are often used to ensure med compliance. In my case my mother signed commitment papers, but I signed in voluntarily in a hearing. Until that hearing, I don’t recall anyone asking me if I would admit myself voluntari
ly, or even recommending hospitalization even though I was seeing a therapist twice a week at the time. What specifically do you think hospitalization will do for your partner? What are your expectations of how it might improve his mental health? I feel you may have naive or fanciful expectations about hospitalization. In my experience the chief benefits of hospitalization are protecting the patient and society from the stresses each pose to the other, and providing a safe structured environment for treatment to progress. Because it is costly and restrictive, the vast majority of mental health treatment is outpatient."
176268394,"Very cool. Thank you for sharing your story, folkusthesecond."
176268395,Me too _PERSON_. Maybe try thinking of a good topic to post on the forum and wait for replies?
176268396,Our pain and sorrow is very real. This is such a terrible illness. But there IS hope for a better future. Take care of yourself and learn and do what you can!
176268397,You’re lucky you survived that _AT_MENTION_
176268398,My daughter is on the smaller dose of 50 mg and it has been doing okay for her. At first she was drowsy so they told her she could split her pill. So really she is doing 25 mg. It is still keeping her voices quiet. They did up her buspar recently.
176268399,I had it upped just by 25mg last week. I’m feeling pretty dizzy most of the day. Otherwise it seems to be helping a bit. I just hate this dizzy feeling.
176268400,Pretty sure it was all being raped and abused. Which I guess by your assumptions that that makes me weak is what triggered my sz.

I mean, if you think he is getting better psychiatric-wise, it’s worth him staying, right? Can you send him a book or music that can entertain him instead of waiting bad tv?"
176268410,"Yes, I took one this morning. Felt great!"
176268411,Thanks. I’ll try to remember that.
176268412,"Welcome to the forum rosyd. I am so sorry that your son has already missed an appointment and already plans to go off the shots. Dr _PERSON_ who wrote “I’m Not Sick, I Don’t Need Help” has really helped us get through difficult times with our son. Are you already familiar with the symptom anosognosia? Its so terribly disappointing when they stop meds, especially when you could see the meds were working for him."
176268413,i don’t feel many emotions… last time i cried was when my kitty cat died. But besides that i don’t feel much of emotions.

176268415,Now I suppose you have to talk to your social worker or whoever is in charge there and tell them that both your mother and you agree to this situation and that you would like the opportunity to get out. Ask them what you can do to get out soon.
176268416,i get enough money from disability… i’m doing ok… i wouldn’t mind getting some more but it’s not really needed but if i would get a lot of money i would prob buy a big house(s) where my mum and dad and me and my siblings and their kids could live.

My son was just like your son before we found the right medication and I knew it was a matter of time before he ended up locked up. Luckily, every time a crisis occurred I was there and directed him to the hospital or a treatment facility. I knew if I didn’t find the right medicine, he would be in jail or in worse danger, twirling circles homeless on the streets. I feel for you and

176268423,"My brother is 32 and has either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. He has been sick for over 8 years. It started out as headaches and what he called “brain fog,” and I think in an attempt to figure out what was wrong, he started questioning his physical health. He has been to so many doctors and has had thousands of tests, but almost everything comes back normal. Yet he refuses to believe it, and has an excuse for everything. When the dr’s don’t find anything it’s because they’re incompetent and lazy, and we haven’t found the right one. He has gotten violent with my mom and hounds her and I everyday, saying that we abandoned him and if only we listened and found “the” doctor, he would be healthy by now. I don’t know what to do. There is no talking to him about any of this. His mind is so made up that he “moved something in his chest.” I have Dr _PERSON_’s book and I tried rebuilding a relationship with him, which only lasts a few days (if that) until he turns it ar
ound on me and blames me for him being sick. He desperately WANTS to get better, but he refuses to believe it is anything “mental,” only physical. I don’t know how to help him. I think assisted or involuntary treatment is the way to go, but I don’t know how to go about doing that. He has threatened suicide in the past, as well as my parents lives, but not much comes out of it. He knows how to work the system once he’s in. I guess the only difference is that usually took place in IL and now he is in MA."

176268425,"_PERSON_, hi there. I also wanted to comment on the fact that as a graphic designer your son may not only be a good fit for his prior job as it was something that utilized his natural talents, but that he may be using his drawing as a comfortable healthy way for him to therapeutically process what he’s going through internally. It might be something that feels familiar when he feels within himself things are out of control. Strong creative types, in my own experience and me being one as well, I believe can often find grounding and outlet and focus in these acts of creating. Like a meditation… I wouldn’t worry about it or discourage it, in my own unprofessional opinion"

We’re here to help each other out through unimaginable problems and I would bet that most people here would agree that sz people can be very manipulative and take over our whole lives. For what I could understand you’re fairly new to this. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel. Sorry. You either accept it or you don’t. For me it’s about love, actually. Either you love such person enough to allow them to bring so much damage into your life or you don’t. And I’m not judging. Twenty years from now I’ll probably be a very bitter person. No career, no husband, no children. It’s such a horrible illness a horrible fate, and it affects everyone who is close to them. I think you should look into places where he can be cared for.

I assumed he would never be selected for a jury but he very nearly was. I’m not sure he should be on a jury, but I’m not sure he shouldn’t. Maybe I should ask his psychiatrist about it?

176268441,"My brother who is 55 now has had schizophrenia since junior year of high school. Has been hospitalized several times. My parents always protected him. After my parents divorced he lived with my dad until he passed away. Came to live with my mom after that in 2014. He has maintained his illness well, on Clozapine and would drive himself for blood tests, was not able to work because of side effect of excessive sleep. A few years ago his psychiatrist who was great retired and he got an awful heartless one. Since Covid lockdown his schedule got totally messed up and he could no longer talk to his psychiatrist in person and had to do it over the phone. He has been off his meds for year and half now and been hospitalized 3 times. I had to do the heart wrenching job of calling the crisis center to have him evaluated and hospitalized. Each time because of patients rights and privacy laws, I was not able to be involved in his treatment. He would refuse to take meds and then eventually discharged within a fe
w days. Unless I tell them he’s violent to himself or others he can not get the help he needs. Last time he was discharged and came home he pushed and punched my 86 year old mother on the back! I had to remove her immediately to an apartment. I called the crisis center and same cycle happened. I need to sell the house and since he was living there by himself last time he came home, he has completely destroyed the place almost to the point that it could be condemned. He is now living on the streets and won’t take his meds or go to a shelter. The law here is if doesn’t want to go for treatment or go to assisted living place to be treated voluntarily I can’t do anything! I am desperate and scared for my brother. How can I help him, he says he’s on meds but still very psychotic, delusional, not making any sense. I feel like I have no options. If anyone has experienced similar situation if they can share what they did I would really appreciate it. Thank you"

176268445,"Here's _NAME_. My new kitty. _PERSON_ recommended an _NAME_ collar for 10 days!!!! And antibiotics twice a day. She is not easy to give antibiotics to. I am used to _NAME_ who would let me open her mouth and shoot the medicine down her throat. This little girl barely opens her mouth and then spits some of it back out! I hope she is getting enough to be useful. She is having a hard time with the collar. She hasn't really eaten much yet or drank much of anything. We have her in the guest bedroom. My dad opened the curtains so she can lay on the bed and look outside. She seems to like that. Her incision is pretty small but I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get red or puffy. _NAME_ either doesn't know there is a new cat in the house or doesn't care. _NAME_ would have been back there sniffing under the door. _NAME_ hasn't meow-_NAME_ yet so maybe _NAME_ hasn't noticed.

Tonight I hope to bring her into the living room and see how she does. _NAME_ will likely be outside and so it will be an introduction to _NAME_, Mom's dog. We will probably put _NAME_ on a leash so she can't get to _NAME_ and see how _NAME_ reacts to the dog being in the room. And treats for both. _NAME_ is very cuddly and lovey just what I wanted. I hope she doesn't end up spending all her time outdoors like _NAME_ though. I want a cat that will cuddle with me when I watch TV. Attached Images _NAME_.jpg (359.8 KB, 5 views)"

176268447,My son has been on clozapine 450 mg fir 6 yrs. now he’s convinced he has Akathisia despite lack of medical support and has decreased med o his own and says he’s done with drs poisoning him with neuroleptic. I’m terrified.He is manic super skinny and obsessed with researching every med and medical symptom. I believe he could be having EPS symptoms but going off meds willing only make things worse. He says he cannot work anymore due to pain so he is applying g for disability but I doubt they’ll grant it.
176268448,"It is very hard watching our children suffer. As parents, we want the best of everything for them. I think we all feel helpless regarding this illness. Whether it was drug induced or brought on by natural causes, all we can do is love them and attempt to guide them to make good life choices. I admire your dedication and concern for your daughter. She is lucky to have you. Do you have anyone close by you can go out to eat with or to the movies with? Sometimes we have to put ourselves first. As the saying goes, “You can’t pour from an empty cup.” I know that my own daughter has been used and abused by friends and boyfriends. Her counselor is trying to teach her to say no and not be victimized. From what my daughter tells me, this illness makes her feel so worthless, alone, and bad about herself, that if anyone shows any interest towards her, she jumps on it because she is lonely. The counselor has warned me that people with sz are often victimized. Does your daughter see a counselor? It may hel
p her and then it would shift some of the responsibility off you. You definitely need someone to talk with, too. Thinking of you. Thank you for reaching out. It means a lot."

176268466,"I think that for many people they have to weigh the aspect of harm (violation of trust) vs. help. The hope is that when the person with SMI is “taken away” involuntarily that he/she gets needed treatment. Unfortunately, that treatment even in a psychiatric hospital is often short-lived. As caregivers or family members, we can take other steps in an attempt to document and insist on the need for longer involuntary treatment (assuming the sick person is not cooperative with treatment). In my case, my loved one did not WANT to be in a hospital or take medication. However, he got so sick that he eventually got needed treatment and has been medication compliant for almost 2 years. And he is doing well and working part-time."
176268467,"One thing that I’ve often struggled with while dealing with mental health professionals is the basis of spirituality. I am a self taught theologian and occultist, as well as an herbologist/shaman. Seemingly though, any practice besides atheism or some form of half assed christianity is the only practice not considered “inherently insane”. I have evolved in my pursuit of knowledge, ranging from more popular religions such as christianity, islam and judaism, to more obscure practices like thelema, laveyan satanism, wicca, and jewish mysticism. I’ve become equated with forms of medicine not well accepted in the united states, but seen as a first resort in some other cultures. I am also somewhat of a psycho-naught, as Ive experimented with things like peyote or psibocilic mushrooms, usually as part of a ritual. Something that psychiatrists should keep in mind when treating a patient is that it’s not always about what YOU beleive is tangible. It’s about whether or not your patient has a worl
d view that helps them sleep soundly at night. Things like kundilani experiences, Chakras, alchemy of mind and transmutation of thoughts are all a part of occult philosophy and it branches into the psychology of the occult. Some religions and practices are far fetched to me, but there is an entire worldview WITHIN the occult, that believes that there is nothing supernatural about it to begin with. Things like demons and possession being parts of human conscousness that can run amiss and act independently. The idea of the holy guardian angel actually being the superego. I’ve spent a lot of time studying _NAME_ janes, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, and I think maybe psychologists and psychiatrists need to have a picnic or something and exchange ideas, and then educate themselves about different cultural movements as to become less ignorant about it."

Someone told me that it is really hard to medicate teenagers because of all the hormones raging. I think that’s right, judging from my son. I will be thinking of you and your daughter.

176268474,I think it’s the meds.
176268475,I find that surprising. What did she say was wrong with it?
176268476,"Yes, as I recall your husband is high-functioning and well regarded in the workplace and there’s a tendency to thrust such people into managerial roles they aren’t well suited for, because management doesn’t understand this. My solution when pushed into these roles is to alternately do a poor job to discourage assigning more such responsibilities, or bending the role into more of a detached mentoring or consulting supervisor/manager. It can be a precarious balancing act. Another tack is to use other aspects of a favorable work environment to avoid such pressures, like retreating to a lab or studio or closing an office door or taking a mental health day in hopes such tensions blow-over. You can only get away with such antics if you are valuable in other ways to colleagues. Often organizations intuitively sense that certain “creative types” are special cases and develop mechanisms to protect them. Think, _PERSON_ in Mad Men. But turnover or mergers can bring people into managerial roles who 
don’t understand or respect their special status and tear down these protections with disastrous consequences. High functioning employees with SMI tend to entrench themselves at their jobs, because it takes time to build protective systems and human networks that allow them to function. There’s a huge social cost for them to look for a new job, so its hard sometimes to forcefully push back or leave when management makes such fateful decisions."

Within 4 months rehospitalized, and now goes for injection and takes oral for anxiety and depression. Claims it doesnt work and not what he needs or wants. He wants to smoke week more than anything else in the world. It is possible to live and manage with out meds in some cases. As long as the person is willing to manage the symptoms honestly and whole heartedly. It is scary. My son roamed on his bike for 40 miles in pouring rain and still claims it was an adventure and something he needed to do. Keep reaching out for your own support. Can only offer to him what you can.

176268498,"A few years ago I went to my local Carer’s Support Group and the man there asked me and my mother about my sister. Once we had described her he asked me, “What is worse? Her narcicissm or her schizophrenia?” I replied that her narcicissm was worse. Does anyone know the difference? I find that I can sit and listen to her delusional thinking all right, but it’s when she tries to control me, to the point of controlling what I have for dinner, controlling my friends, it’s that behaviour that is oppressive to me. It’s like she’s in control of everything. Can someone tell me the difference and do they have a loved one who displays narcicissitic traits and is this part of schizophrenia?"

Although still doing mindless things still makes me feel resentment to my existence - Although much less now. I snapped at my dads friend once when he told me to do something and he regretted it and said ""It's just that you're young and that's the thing"" - But I told him that it's not somewhere anyone wants to go because I've felt so much pain in the past and never stood up for myself. The last time I saw my ex step dad, he was showing me the ""proper way"" to get snow off the garage door - I was doing that while he got into his truck and drove away.

Hoping that in 20-30 years when we may no longer be able to care for him, that our oldest is stable and independent. Or hoping that if our oldest can’t live without help that my two younger children have hearts like yours? Great question that you and others on this forum may uniquely hold the answer."

I ignored what he said knowing it was the illness talking and not m son. After he got clarity he is back to the living son I know. So don’t listen to that talk or take it to hart. While getting well, if my son had a bad day he’d ask to go to the hospital and I’d calm him down and he’l him avoid it. Now he hasn’t gone in almost a year. He has previously been in the hospital dozens of times. Your son is young. Without treatment he will get worse. It is had work to get them to trust you. But your hard work will pay off. He can have a life again."
176268505,Could help. Just watch out for side effects.
176268506,"_AT_MENTION_, I’m in tears reading your story. Did your son have a history of endangering himself or others? On what grounds did the doctor call the police? What was your sons crime other than wanting to finally see a doctor and get on meds? I’m not seeing the full picture. You can’t arrest someone for being schizophrenic. Is there more to the story? If this happened the way you’re explaining it, I do believe you may have a valid lawsuit against the police Dept as well as that doctor / hospital. How disgusting to be tricked like that. Your poor son, how he must feel betrayed by you, the doctor, and the police! I’m sure his paranoia was high to begin with, I can only imagine what he’s going thru now."
176268507,Glad things appear to be moving forward for you _AT_MENTION_ . I was diagnosed in 2009 too.
176268508,"My wife’s family has been very supportive. Several times over the past couple years, they’ve been able to convince her to resume taking her medication, when I’d failed. They’ve also expressed concern about our daughter and indicated they would support me however I decide to proceed. As you can imagine, the pandemic complicates things, but my wife has spent almost five months out of the past year back with her family – she was there for most of December and January. Those trips have been a welcome respite for me and our daughter. She has seen a psychiatrist there – they prescribed her current medication. During her latest trip, she was hospitalized for two weeks as a result of not complying with a travel quarantine, and I’d hoped that would shake things up, but she didn’t continue with medication after her discharge. So I am not sure that she would receive better care there – I think the most clear benefit would be more social support from friends and family. I worry that she won
t be willing to separate if it comes from me. Ironically, she has brought it up herself – last year she told me that “we are separated”, though she has mainly used that to argue that she does not need to respect boundaries and is free to do as she pleases. During one of her family visits, I’d told her she should stay unless/until she is willing to accept treatment but she didn’t accept that and I didn’t have any leverage to enforce it."

176268513,"My experience hasn’t been nearly as intense as yours, _AT_MENTION_, but I can relate to the loneliness (I’ve got a schizophrenic sister who was tough for my parents to manage even before the overt psychosis developed, and more recently a husband who has had two pretty extended periods of unmediated psychosis). My sister’s issues did have an impact on me, I think, in terms of making me unaccustomed to considering my own needs from the time I was quite young - which, as I am starting to see, has really set me up to play the same role in my marriage. It is hard to figure out the right thing to do or how to maintain some sort of sustainable balance. Or it is for me, at any rate. Therapy helps, and might also help you feel a little less alone in your pain? Or it has for me, at any rate. Your situation (in terms of your guy’s ultimatum) is so sad and poignant. It reminds me of the dilemma of one of the characters in the movie “Love, Actually”, who, as it turns out, has a severely mentally ill 
brother and who has to choose between her brother and her own happiness. I have always felt that she made the wrong choice, or that there was really a way in which the options were not as black or white as she was seeing them. It’s the one scene in the movie where I find myself hoping the character will make a different decision and find some sort of middle ground each time I watch it. And after reading your posts, I am finding myself wishing the same for you, of course. But I admit that I am not nearly as good at negotiating the sort of balance I would wish for others in my own life - which is something many of us here seem to struggle with. So perhaps, at least in this one way, we are not truly alone?"

176268515,"Hi there. I have decades long experience with this topic- and I may be able to provide some insight and perhaps- some relief. First. I am not a parent of a schizophrenic child- and I can’t imagine what it must be like to have a child with this illness. My twin was diagnosed sz. in 1992 after a volatile period of delusions, violence and abusive language. After my brother was placed on medication and moved back to my hometown- I sincerely tried to put aside past grievances and be the most supportive brother I could be. (we never had an amicable relationship for most of our lives) The guilt I felt was oppressive. The sense of over responsibility I had was equally oppressive. The messaging in my own head was also brutal. Like you- I would ask myself what do I have be be thankful for? How can I be so callous towards my brothers situation and feel joy? Doing something small for myself felt outright cruel. Which made me feel ashamed. For years. Being selfish still feels… ugly. What I finally had to le
arn was this. No one was going to come along and inject a sense of entitlement into my psyche. No one was going to appear to tell me that I still deserved a life. That I deserved love- freedom- peace- calm- intimacy and hope. I HAD to learn to forgive myself. Forgiving myself for simply- (on occasion) feeling a deep sense of resentment for being in this scenario. I can’t begin to tell everyone the deep sense of shame I harbored for this anger. I had to live in this shame for years while I examined my brothers disease from every angle to determine if I had somehow caused his illness in the first place. The cycle of survival guilt, shame and over-responsibility can and WILL consume your entire life if you let it. I had to not only examine the root cause of the guilt and shame but how it manifested within my work and relationships. Without getting too far into it- I had to stop accepting abusive or unfair treatment as a means of paying off my survival guilt. Does that make sense? I hope someday soon you can lo
ok objectively at how this illness has impacted your life and find peace in knowing that you’re doing everything you can do- as a Mom. In the meantime- perhaps a walk- a bath- a good book could provide you some small relief. I hope it can. Love and light. R-"

176268520,"Hi, so I have treatment resistant schizophrenia and my psychiatrist stopped answering my calls. A pharmacist told me later (1-2 months of no return of voicemails from his reception) that she could tell right away when she saw my file that this pdoc was doing some thing very wrong with my medication and even giving me dangerous and illogical combinations. Also this pdoc was abusive to me whenever we had 1-on-1 sessions (he was fine when I had an outreach nurse present, or a resident student present, then he was very kind). Anyway, so I’m without a doctor, and to spite the system and be stupid I stopped taking 100mg Invega Injection abruptly 2 months ago. I have poor tolerance of medications. Sometimes they even put me in a deleriant like state if the dosage is too high (for example 450mg of seroquel or 20 mg of zyprexa), and also sometimes give me seizures. Due to my inability to leave the house and immense isolation from family who have cut me off due to my acting out delusional thoughts through 
harsh and mean speech, I feel horribly ashamed and am thinking that they (meaning those familiar with my file) are hoping, even pushing me, to kill myself as I have two attempts. [_USER_ID_: I am NOT suicidal. Do not worry]. However, saner minds are trying to prevail. And I found an old prescription of zyprexa for 10mg daily as needed, dispensed every 7 days. I was able to get the pharmacist to give it as 14x 5 mg disintegrating tablets. From past experience I know that I feel very drowsy for 36-48 hours after taking 10mg+ of it. However I never started with a dose as low as 5mg, i’m hoping to take it slow and within a week or two have good results, as from what I understand from the latest studies and from word of mouth of respected psych nurses, olanzapine works much quicker than other APs. At 5mg will I experience many side effects? What time of day should I take the med? I read peak plasma levels are reached in 6 hours. So should I take it 4-6 hours before bed (supper time) or more like right before bed
? What is your experience? How did you mitigate side effects? bonus question: Not the main point of my post here, but out of curiosity, has anyone else had delirious/dementia like symptoms that are comparable to a dose of 500+ mg of diphenhydramine (a hallucinogen deleriant class drug, aka, benedryl) before like I have?

Once the department accepts me and issues the official letter, I’d have one or two more step to go. In the meantime, I interviewed with another Professor at Col State doing Digital Agriculture.

176268544,"Barely. He’s been taking the same 300mg of Seroquel he’s been taking for 30 yrs that kept him symptomless for 29 yrs and quit working last year. He refuses to take anything else. They’ve tried to increase it to 900mg and he refuses. They tried to give him Clozapine while an inpatient but he quit the day he walked out of the hospital - said it made him feel “funny”. He’s not willing to try anything else cuz he’s done his research and they all have side effects. I would think that what he’s going thru (which he says he hates more than anything) is much worse than any side effects, but he’s stubborn. So he’s barely medicated. Can’t imagine him taking nothing. I think he actually only takes the Seroquel cuz it helps him sleep. He can’t sleep without it. So, yes and no. Yes, he takes some meds. And no, he doesn’t take what is recommended or anything that actually works… _PERSON_"
176268545,Idk am I overmedicated or not
176268546,"Awareness is not a switch, nor do drugs necessarily create it. Note the expression is usually “becoming aware” or “gaining awareness”. In yogic and Buddhist disciplines this pursuit can take a lifetime. You may be looking for logic where there is none. Your son may be getting his injections for reasons unrelated to being aware in the sense you are expecting. One person’s daughter on the forum takes medication because she relates it to being employed and she likes her job so she gets her injections. Similarly I started taking medication out of fear that I might lose my job after a year of psychotherapy, I didn’t like that prospect so I gave in after much resistance. Similarly you can be aware of behaviors, take drugs to designed to help with them, and even be motivated to stop, yet still fail to gain control. For example appetite suppressants for dieting, or nicotine patches or Chantix for smoking cessation. Psychiatrists are largely glorified psychopharmacologists nowadays, so from your 
son’s doctor’s perspective she thinks she’s done aside from maintenance monitoring. Your son is taking his injections, his symptoms are reduced, he isn’t hospitalized, he has a job. The rest is figuring out coping behaviors and everyone affected learning to live with the disease. Given considerable prejudice psychiatrists have toward individual psychotherapy for SZ that grew out of failures of Freudianism, family therapy may be the best your doctor can suggest for this situation. There’s Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but beyond these, you’re pretty much on your own. And that’s where I think _PERSON_ comes in. You’re making the mistake of thinking of SZ more as an acute disease rather than a chronic disease and thinking if only your son had insight or awareness and takes his medication there’d be no need for any of this. Unfortunately it doesn’t work like this. LEAP is a process with an initial goal most people have of taking medication, but it doesn’t end there, nor does convincing someo
ne to take medication mean they necessarily gain insight, it’s likely a more pragmatic calculus. For example I take cholesterol and blood pressure medication, because my doctor tells me I should. I can’t say this gives me much insight into the disease other than if I don’t do this, I‘m at risk for a heart attack or stroke. He can nag me to exercise more, lose weight and watch my diet, but unless I learn to adopt these habits on my own it’s beyond his control."

I had a sense that I won’t be able to make it home until I make some move in my career March – I decide to quit my Job in America ( I felt bold after I got a Ph.D offer) Job was dull, I didn’t see my life doing low-level programming and being stuck in immigration. No matter how hard I worked, my immigration status won’t change, the programming job didn’t mean much to me. April – Packing, paperwork, selling my car, visiting friends in America. This was difficult doing all by myself in a new place April 15 - April 21 - Jet Lag, My landing in my home country, seeing my Dad. I felt extremely happy. I couldn’t measure the happiness spending two weeks having meals with my Dad. Although my Dad wasn’t pleased with me quitting my job. April 20 – I came home and found that I won’t get funding for my Ph.D at my previous university, I didn’t panic or was nervous. 
I felt safe because I was at home in my own country. I could pull off anything in my home country. April 21 - May 1 - Sent more emails to Profs about joining for Ph.D April 26 - Considered applying for jobs in home country, applied for many jobs May 1 - Got a call at a premier institution for Research internship, they asked if I’d join. May 6 - Interview for U of Arkansas (Two Ph.D students interviewed me) May 7 - I get offer for Ph.D May 13 - Canadian Prof interviews me (Asks me to write a research proposal) May 15 - I accept the Offer Summary – I felt happy being with my Dad, seeing my Mom and Brother. I didn’t care what they thought, but I wanted to be feel internally happy before I step out again."

176268556,"My son (age 27) was diagnosed w/schizophrenia and labeled “gravely disabled” by the state with Medical/doctor/psychiatry proof. I chose not to apply for guardianship after being told I would be financially responsible for all prior medical bills. At the time he didn’t have medical insurance and had medical debt I couldn’t pay. Instead, I found a residential program for him, applied for social security and Medicare to off set expenses. A long journey later… he’s med compliant, stable and living his best life in a residential community that loves him. My understanding (in California) is you have to reapply yearly for guardianship. I did initially have to take my son to court to get an order for antipsychotic injections. He was really angry at the time; it saved his life. Stay strong. Parenting the mentally ill takes grit.

176268564,"I found this article, and I thought I’d post it. Most everyone here knows I am a big advocate of clozapine because of the positive influence it had on my son’s sz when his prognosis was deemed untreatable. The thing I was not fully aware of is the biggest reason that clozapine is not prescribed as one of the first drugs in a hard to treat case is because studies show that a mere 8 out of 1000 patients “may” develop a reduction in white blood cells (neutropenia) …and while that is a very serious condition, 8 patients out of 1000 is not an enormous negative outcome from any study. Although it can be serious for those 8 patients that is still 992 patients that see good results. I think those odds seem to favor the majority of patients, My son has been on it for 10 years without any major issues or any bad lab results, even the significant initial weight gain and sleepiness subsided and improved in the first 2 years. Clozapine was my son’s 8th prescription and it took him almost 4 years and 
3 doctors and 2 suicide attempts and 4 hospitalizations from his day of diagnosis to get to it. Looking back that was just too long. I believe his last doctor was aggressive in trying to treat my son, some of the final delay was the last couple months before he prescribed the clozapine I drug my heels in saying yes to it just because I knew nothing of the drug at that time and all of the drugs and their side effects scared me anyway and I had to read and ask questions until I felt satisfied with the information. It was my sons’s doctor saying to me finally, “if your boy was my son I would have him on this drug right now”. Then I said okay. Within 6 months of my son being on the drug and with the amazing improvements I was seeing I was immediately sorry I had taken so long to think it over. I would recommend caretakers to strongly advocate for a doctor using this medication as soon as they can when it is deemed that the patient is very difficult to treat and is not responding well to other drugs. If a dr
ug is prescribed (any drug) and it doesn’t noticeably reduce the voices or the delusions in a reasonable amount of time then it is NOT WORKING. In addition. if the patient is seeing his doctor alone, he may not be able to accurately express to the doctor (because of his ongoing condition) that the medicine is not working, he or she may say when asked “how the medicine is working?” They may just find it easier to say “it’s fine” and this the doctor makes no changes unless the doctor hears everything that’s actually going on from a reliable source (the caregiver) ~~Just my two cents. https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/clozapine-for-schizophrenia"
176268565,Sometimes I’ll get these subtle pains in my head. But they don’t last long fortunately
176268566,"My adopted son was severely abused in his old home. His birth mother ended up putting him in a wire dog kennel and leaving it in the basement, in a few inches of standing water, and he was found several weeks later. It was pitch black, he had to drink the dirty water on the ground, and the tepid water caused some of his flesh to literally rot - and bugs got in. Obviously very traumatic. His schizophrenia became symptomatic during that time and now he is convinced that there are bugs all over him all the time, trying to eat him up. He thought a bug was behind his eye and clawed it out. He’s got big scratches all over him where he tries to scratch them away. But the point of this post is not the bugs. The point is that he has severe abandonment issues (obviously) and he believes the voices in his head to be people that won’t abandon him, unlike everyone else. He causes harm to himself and lives in constant fear because of his schizophrenia and we got him to take medications once and it helped a l
ot but when he stopped hearing the voices he got scared and refused to take them. I could force him to take them, or trick him, but I don’t want to do that. I want to keep building the little bit of trust we’ve been working on. How can I make him feel like the voices are not the only constants in his life and that I’m not going to abandon him?"

I may make an earlier appointment to see my psychiatrist. This is awful.
176268572,My son was never violent or angry. When he lived in the group home there was a homeless person killed in the town and he had a lot of fear of someone killing him. He has been homeless a number of times. He also has fears of falling out of a car when its moving so locks the door. He did hit a nurse In the hospital once when she was trying to give him meds and he was charged with that. He never had a physical fight in his life. But I do know people who have had to deal with violence due to delusions. It’s the most difficult thing to deal with. My heart goes out to them. I don’t know how they do it. Wishing everyone all the best with your struggles. It really helps to talk with others sharing the same experiences. I’m going to take some time off line now for my own mental health.

176268581,Know exactly how you feel. You described my life except i have a wonderful husband. If we weren’t on the same page we would definitely end on divorce: like many couples have.
176268582,"I tend to agree with _AT_MENTION_ here. I’ll add your information about both conditions is incorrect or misinterpreted. Throughout the spectrum of psychotic disorders from Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder (NOT “schizoaffected“ [sic] disorder) and others, voices can be and often are persistent and not random. In my case, I had conversations (one-sided to outside observers) with a male/female pair of imagined FBI agents I thought were surveilling me. They had names and “spoke” to each other and to me. It was not unlike the dialog of the X-Files, but my episodes predated the shows. DID’s primary characteristic is disassociation. Symptoms include: amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, identity confusion, identity alteration, loss of feeling or control of movement. The name of the disorder was changed specifically to avoid confusion with schizophrenia related disorders which in turn was confused with “split personalities” due to misunderstandings about the name coined for the 
disorder which literally means “split mind”. The “split” in schizophrenia is between thought and emotion and personality doesn’t enter into it. DID is generally thought to be relatively rare, and some psychiatrists (largely in the US) question its existence. It’s not uncommon for people to be deluded or coached into thinking that they have it within or without therapy. While it is possible for the two conditions to be comorbid, it’s not common and given DID’s rarity and difficult treatment, a psychiatrist would most likely treat for schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and worry about any DID symptoms later. Disclaimer: While I am a part-time caregiver of my brother and father with SMI, I was diagnosed with SZA over thirty years ago. I’m an advocate of appropriate drug treatments for SMI, but I feel they are incomplete treatments and additional CBT, supportive talk and psychosocial therapies are helpful where feasible. Any drug advice is from personal experience or research and not a subst
itute for qualified Psychiatric care."

The syndrome is largely associated with antidepressants, and reported links to atypical neuroleptics are in doubt. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) would be more likely, but it’s more associated with typical antipsychotics than atypicals like Ablifiy. The OP didn’t mention antidepressants, and thus far dosages mentioned are on the low side. Her sister is under the care of a psychiatrist.

176268610,"My son won’t work with a case manager, but if your son is willing, they might help him connect with interested employers."
176268611,I agree my 27 year old son was on his own had a good welding job and decided to do acid with some not good people and that’s when it all went downhill. Months later an evil voice told him to get out of his own house. He hit a vehicle head on and ended up in the mental health floor. His father and I are trying to get him on the right track with his meds. He has no insurance at the time and has been hard to get him proper help. I feel useless and don’t know where to turn.

176268614,"These are good questions for the attorney. It is my understanding that a “guardianship” can at least allow you to say where the person lives. If they wander off, you can have them picked up and returned. It also allows you (if it includes the financial aspect) to use any money (SSI/SSDI) as you believe is best for the person’s benefit and the person cannot waste it or give it away."
176268615,"Thank you so much for posting this link, _AT_MENTION_ In the past few years of dealing with my daughter on meds, and the prior years before she was medicated, I found LEAP invaluable. I will be signing up for the next session that is still open (3 are sold out, one on July 1st is still open) and I think the $130 fee is reasonable. The book is great, but I think an online training will be great."

176268617,I gave my sz alcoholic son an ultimatum rehab or out. I researched facilities that had psychiatrists and stated they had dual diagnosis care. The first time he stayed 90 days most covered by insurance. The second time 60 days - different place due to covid. It can be a blessing as straight mental health programs are expensive and not as transparent

176268622,"I read an article in the last year on a somewhat radical idea of a scale or Continuum between Unipolar Depression, Bipolar 2, Bipolar 1, Schizoaffective, Schizophrenic. It basically said that DSM categories are artificial and people don’t fit into neat categories. They may have some characteristics but not others. For example, I was initially treated for Major Depression and Anxiety Disorder with SSRI’s. Since one of my symptoms was being EXTREMELY wired and unable to sleep for 3 months (torture) as well as having Depression, (feelings of self loathing, thinking I would be better of dead, thinking I was a burden on my family.) I also had a really bad reaction to one of the SSRI’s where my anxiety and wired feeling went through the roof. My new Psych Doc diagnosed me with Bipolar 2, even though I DON’T have a lot of the symptoms (grandiosity, anger or irritability at other people.) He weaned me off SSRI’s and put me on a mood stabilizer. (I have also been on relatively low dose of Seroquel 
for sleep since my hospitalization 5 years ago, which I am continuing.) My son exhibits some symptoms of ultra rapid-cycling mood swings (within the same day), depression (manifesting as anger) grandiosity, and Schizophrenia (auditory hallucinations come and go, vague hallucinations come and go, decreased executive functioning: impaired ability to organize, follow through on plans and inability to make a decision and stick to it.) This article describes a continuum between all of these “Diagnoses.” I have tried Googling Bipolar/Schizophrenia scale, spectrum and continuum, but cannot find it. Anyone remember reading anything like this?"
176268623,"Oh _AT_MENTION_, please try to forgive yourself! As you know in your head (but not in your heart), you are a human being just like your sister, with wants/needs of your own. Yes, she is the more vulnerable and less capable of the two of you, which does put an extra layer of responsibility on you to manage the relationship, as she just does not have the ability to do this. But you can only do what you can do and with your son to care for, you are stretched thin at the best of times. You are doing your best and it’s OK that you were not able to hold it all inside. Your sister is fortunate to have you in her life and I think at some level, she probably knows this. If she doesn’t call or what contact for a while, maybe try to see it as her way of trying to give you the space you need rather than as a sign that you did her harm? And let her give you the gift of space. So much of how we feel is the stories we tell ourselves. And those stories are so often self-critical and even punitive. I think the 
more you are able to let go of the guilt over having a normal human response, the better you’ll feel about yourself and your sister. Hugs"

176268626,? was diagnosed at the age of 30 now i m 39 but i used to have severe depression and mild paranoia since my teenage.but after i began to treatment my depression mostly lost.but i have still some paranoias and hypocondriac fears.
176268627,No nothing really happened. I think I am going to stay at the 45 mg. Since that's what I was at before. I hate med changes. I think my meds are good now. I am going to implore the pdoc to just let me keep them the same now. Ha.
176268628,Strange you should say that…I find often I can’t look people in the eye cause after about 10-15seconds I start to go cross eyed. Which is terrible if anybody wants a straight answer about anything. People don’t think I’m honest cause I look down or away. To compound I have bad vision and sensitivity to light…so su glasses. Which of course make things look worse like I’m purposely hiding my eyes.
176268629,"Correction, it will likely worsen psychosis."
176268630,I’m sorry no one has answered your question. Is there a _USER_ID_ in your area? Someone there might be able to help you.
176268631,"I own my home and have next to no debt. I do believe he would be able to manage just the taxes & utilities after I’m gone. I’m just trying to make things as easy as I can for him with all the red tape and paperwork after I’m gone. He would get the house, and he would also have his own car. I have a few concerns about us living together. Mainly, as you mentioned, I don’t want to “undo” the progress that he has made on his own. Taking meds, keeping dr appointments, going to the pharmacy for his refills, going grocery shopping on his own, occasionally preparing his meals, doing his own laundry etc. We are moms first, and knowing me, I feel like I would coddle him and do everything for him if he lived with me. Also, and this may sound selfish, but I’ve gotten used to the peace and quiet of living alone and I do enjoy solitude. A quiet house just by myself. Not that he would be loud or anything, but it would take some adjusting to get used to the idea of another presence in the house. I ha
ve not presented any ideas to him. These are just my own thoughts. But i know you often mention the 2 of you living together and that it’s going well, and I want that for my son and I too. I know you had mentioned HUD before, I believe you said you were looking into home ownership. I truly hope you do end up with home ownership. It would be one less thing for you to worry about after you are gone."
176268632,Thanks _USER_ID_. I guess I will take it up with the doctor that I’m constipated all the time.
176268633,I agree with many opinions posted above - and I have been there. My son from my first marriage 31 diagnosed after college with sz. He is also an alcoholic. I have been able to get him to rehab for dual diagnosis facilities where he got meds. I have been through this dance 2xs in 6 years with a variety of levels of success. Basically I say I don’t want to ask u to leAve - your rent is meds and no booze . Then when he is working he also pays cash. Seems like you need to buy some time with your spouse. Perhaps install a good lock on your bedroom so she feels safe at night- and understand covid is making everything worse. Good luck and keep coming back
176268634,you are not dumb and i’m sure you aren’t ugly either… i’m sorry to hear you feeling down. I felt also for a while like didn’t understand why my parents had me and felt bad about myself but it got better so i hope it will get better for you too.
176268635,"My paranoia is a little worse lately, I find myself becoming suspicious of friends and checking my blinds for hidden cameras. My next pdoc appointment is june 21st, not sure how the community clinic does appointments or if I could call in for a sooner one. Hope all y'all are doing well, gonna try to check this forum more regularly."
176268636,"I did it, today… after 3 years of my mom asking me to do it (involuntary hospitalization) and I never done it when mom asked because I had too much empathy for my sister and feared the trauma on her and myself… but after many relatives and people on this forum (especially mothers) I did it and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to face in my life so far; however, we absolutely had no other choice as her actual physical health was in jeopardy and for now I just hope and pray it will make my sister feel better and the whole family feel better somehow… I understand some mothers here said it might be one of many to come but I just miss my sister, I miss her so so so much and I pray for a miracle that maybe since she hasn’t been medicated for many years, just maybe they’d give her meds which would make her look at me like she used to, smile at me genuinely like she used to, maybe converse with me or go out with me… I don’t know, I just admitted her today and doctors want to evaluate 
her., we don’t know how long or how very short her stay there might be but… I just hope somehow when I see her again, I’ll catch a glimpse of my baby sister loving me a little bit again… I’m crying, praying, hoping and loving… thank you all for your support, I hope you wish me and my sister well like I do wish for you and all your loved ones"

176268639,"I was working and going to school when I got my delusions. At first the delusions were more of a nuisance that I could shoo away. What started to scare me is it never stopped, the delusions also became more frequent and real feeling. I couldn’t escape it, it drove me mad the constant pestering. I worked and went to school a year while having delusions and was fully functional getting assignments done and doing work while being mentally checked out and out of my mind."
176268640,"It was odd, he said he didn’t notice that much difference one way or the other, bad or good, but he also said he gained 20 lbs in 3 weeks on Risperdal. I couldn’t tell, because he started out pretty skinny, but that’s what he says, anyway. What he said about the Zyprexa was that he felt like it deadened his brain to the point that it made the voices worse - like he could hear them, but couldn’t summon up his own internal voice to drown them out. He went to see the psychiatrist at the First Episode of Psychosis program he was in, and she was the one who took him off of Risperdal. I was surprised, but in retrospect I can see why. He ended up in the hospital again last spring for a few days, and they put him on Zyprexa. I know you’re right about needing time for it to work, but there seems to be a bit of a mixed message on that. The resident told me “we’re not supposed to say this, but when you find the right med, it usually helps right away”. Of course, they thought it was working bec
ause he said what they wanted to hear, and never took it again as soon as he got out. But in his case, I’m not 100% sure that’s bad. He’s been a little bit of an odd duck, because I’m not even sure he meets the definition of psychotic. He hears voices, but has always been aware that they weren’t real (in the sense that others could hear them). I sat in on one of his sessions, and the doc was asking him things like “does the TV talk to you?” And things of that nature, and he said no to each one, and in the way that implied that he was telling the truth and thought they were strange questions, like laughing a little. His main problem is/was negative symptoms - he seems flat and somewhat emotionless, but this is only an exaggeration of how he’s been for years. We (he and I both, independently) assumed that he had _PERSON_, and he still identifies that way. He has isolated himself twice now for a few months at a time. I think he gets worried that the voices will make it hard to interact with peopl
e normally - like, he would get distracted and lose his train of thought, or just act odd, or worse, answer a question that nobody spoke aloud. So he sat inside and smoked a lot of pot. This made him more fearful and more paranoid - bad cycle. Both times, he’s come out of it after awhile, and at least at this time I believe he’s not smoking any pot. He seems better, living with his dad (my ex). He’s taken a few short classes, and he got himself a job (for the first time since high school, and he’s 22). He’s still not working that often, and dragging his feet on taking other classes, etc. Still has no friends, but he doesn’t know anybody in that city, and I’m hoping that work will introduce him to a few people. He has told his dad that he’s not hearing voices at the moment. All in all, he seems to be in a much better place than he was, but I’m cautious about getting my hopes up too high, as I know there seems to be a bit of a cyclical nature to all this. Anyway, this is why I have mixed feeli
ngs about meds. I think that they definitely improve life for some people, and some people are dangerous without them. But if they don’t stop the positive symptoms and make the negative ones worse (and that’s already his worst problem), then I’d like to give him time to see how he does without."

176268643,"I work with students on the spectrum and it is not uncommon to see comorbid psychosis, anxiety, ADHD. I believe that they overlap at a pretty high rate."
176268644,"Court-ordered meds and relapse for paranoid SZ is not a new topic. Still, I’d like to hear from any and all who experience this with their SFI paranoid SZ son. Although medicated, he is miserable, scared a lot, isolating, not active socially. Anti-psychotic meds have caused high blood pressure and PVCs (pre-ventricular contractions) which scare him. M.D.s say they can’t address this side effect. He will not give permission for me to talk with CW or M.D.s as he wants me “on his side.” Doesn’t trust even hates “them.” He even skipped the Yule Holidays this year. This has been occurring since he was 19. He is almost 48 now. Every evening we visit on Messenger and he complains and complains or tells me he’s scared. Anhedonia is the inability to feel happiness or pleasure in life. Tomorrow is the day he is off the court ordered meds. He says he’ll keep taking them. I remember what happened in the past. Advise, comments welcome."

176268646,"I totally understand how frustrating this is, my son does the same things if we try to enforce rules or just because. He has does horrible things as well, burned holes in our clothes, keyed and flattened tires, and just little things as well, things that make you think, hmmm, like taking cards out of the deck. My son thinks he has 10 girlfriends and needs to pay child support. Now he claims he is a god has been since birth. I agree about the hospitalizations, and not being able to get him admitted. so frustrating as we as family know when they are in crisis."

176268650,"My (undiagnosed) ex thinks I live the other end of the country (I didn’t lie to him, he got the wrong idea from nosing through some papers of mine and I knew I would get more peace and quiet if I let him carry on believing it), and he thinks I will be “home for Christmas” to see my family, who live only a few miles away from him. We speak on the phone twice a week, but he would demand more of my time if I picked up when he calls in between scheduled times. Our relationship was dogged by his demands on my time and attention and it was his intense clinginess and neediness that drove me to leave five years ago, rather than the SZ characteristics, which were already evident. Last Christmas my family concocted some story about how I’d be home for a week before having to “get the train back”, and apart from Christmas Day and Boxing Day he managed to absorb almost the whole week for himself - hours long phone calls, days out, even engineering me staying at his flat for 3 days and even “conve
niently” managing to discover a leaking sink pipe that he spent hours repairing, and requiring me to hold a lamp, instead of driving me back to my parents’ house on the day my sister came over to visit, so that I missed her. Now he is pestering me to tell me when I will be “home for Christmas” this year. We spoke this morning and he said that we “always” see each other for a few days before and after Christmas, and he started going on about how it looked like I was going to “deprive” him of any time together before Christmas and only see him for a few days afterwards. The reason I left was because he is oblivious to the concept of other people having boundaries and he just makes it impossible to set any or stick to them, and I just find the amount of time and attention he demands exhausting. It would be nice to see him over Christmas, but I don’t want the whole holiday to be about him. And yes, I really do want to see my sister this year! So, what I’m trying to work out is what days I am

This is really bad, it is impossible to have any conversation with her because she will make up these incredible stories. She has told me atleast 3 different names.

We forced her into hospital three years ago for 3 months, that was the only time she was medicated and she stayed on the meds for about 8 months afterwards. She picked up some weight and was cleaner during that time. She was desperately unhappy in the psych wards and the whole family suffered. In the end we helped her break out when they wanted to start her on lithium and more shock treatments. We will never use force against her again. Now she lives with her sister, she doesn’t speak or wash and her toilet habits are interesting to say this least. She smells terrible. She is dreadfully thin but eats quite a lot. She makes shopping lists for her sister. She smiles at us and we get a kiss from time to time, but little other communication.

Honestly, it is not really useful to find out what a few other people experienced because each medication has known (published…https://www.abilify.com/) side effects but any one individual may have a different experience with the same medication…effectiveness and side effects. It also depends on the dosage. General guidelines for any A/P drug: If it works for your loved one, great. If new to the drug, you have to give it time to work. It may take many months to reach full efficacy. (The pharmaceutical info provides efficacy and dosage information.) If you have questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask the doctor. Side effects may diminish after the body gets more used to the medication. Keep a diary of what you are seeing with your loved one, which may be helpful to give to the doctor at some point.

I actually had him apply for SSI the week prior but if he’s is able to keep this job I guess he won’t need it. The only “hiccup” we’ve had is he did start denying again that he has SZ, he believes that what he was going through was just “stress”. This was very upsetting since he had previously gained insight that he has it.

His mother’s comment said something like “when we adopted him, he would have been perfectly fine or they would not have put him up for adoption.” DUH! I had no knowledge of mental illnesses back then but have learned in the many, many years since. If you have no children with him, is this the life you want for yourself? Maybe I’m being too blunt but this (SZ) is genetic, incurable and is pure hell to live with unless you can find the medications that can control it. And so far, I’ve found nothing for my son that lasts for more than two or three years - and I’ve been trying, trying, trying for more years than I can count."

176268686,"Hi, I’m 16 years old, as is my boyfriend of just under a month. He’s on the autism spectrum (as am I) , has mild psychosis and schizophrenia- so far I know that he experiences auditory and visual hallucinations, though he has experienced a few ‘happy’ and ‘dream like’ ones (his own words), the majority are frightening. I’ve noticed he becomes incredibly nervous around strangers and worries about who they are, what they’re doing, their motives etc (I try to avoid him having to walk home alone at night as a result but he’s adamant that it’s ‘fine and he doesn’t mind’). Can anyone give me advice in any sense? As a person with schizophrenia, what do you wish people would do for you? I love him dearly and being autistic, can empathize with his subsequent existentialism, however, I don’t know enough about schizophrenia and want him to feel at least somewhat understood, and at least cared about. I’d ask him directly but he doesn’t like people to do things for him (has a lot 
of doubt in relation to his self-worth). Thank you :), I just want to learn as much as I can to do better for both him, and other people with schizophrenia x"

176268691,"Abstract It has been proposed that interaction of catecholamines and indoleamines with free radicals may result in the formation of endogenous neurotoxins. In order to better understand the mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative disorders showing evidence of oxidative stress, we have studied the basal concentrations and the turnover rates of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and their metabolites in the prefrontal cortex of rats that were fed on control or low selenium diets. Nutritional deficit of selenium decreases the brain antioxidant protection in experimental conditions by the decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity. The dopamine and serotonin turnover increased and noradrenaline and 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid turnover decreased compared to experimental control animals. The increase of dopamine turnover in experimental rats was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These results suggest that the decrease of brain protection against oxidative damage could induc

176268694,"I am so distressed reading these posts as I too, am having such a hard time trying to help my unofficially adopted son who is 30 and I took him in at 22. He is what his therapist believe SZA and most definitely anosognosia. This MI is so damn debilitating to everyone involved. I am so sick of hearing that statement if they are not in harm of themselves or others there is nothing we can do unless they ask for help. This is the craziest statement as they are ILL and cannot or will not ask for help. Like Dr. _NAME_ said how many people have to die from this to get the attention it needs. We as a society need to help them, this is out of control and our homeless population keeps growing as we stand by and do nothing. Come On wake up: We need to help them as they cannot help themselves. My son, will now be homeless again as he is very ill, rude, disrespectful, out of touch, delusional, doesnt work, cant keep a job as he believes everybody is out to get him. He lives off of us and contributes nothing… 
as he is too ill. We have tried everything we can possibly think of to help. His therapist, and PO both agree he needs meds and other resources for help but nothing… MI dept. wont touch him unless he asks for it. HELLO…not going to happen. What are we as caretakers supposed to do as he has made our life hell but we are still here trying to help because we love him and he has nowhere to go or anybody else to help him. He has been in the foster care system his whole life and does not even know his biological family. His previous adoptive parents kicked him out at 15 and never spoke to him again, dropped him off at a group home and never turned back. I can see now that he was too much to handle but cant imagine doing that to any person. However, he is soon to be removed from our homes as he is unpredictable and irrational, so now what??? My heart breaks for all the families going thru this. It is so not ok. I seen another post from a elderly couple who are again dealing with their son who is not taking care 
of himself. It is an epidemic that needs to be addressed. How long will society keep ignoring the obvious? the HIPPA law is a joke as you mentioned, they supposedly protect them for confidentiality. Caretakers and Dr.s need to work together for the sake of our loved ones. This is just plain in human."

He is back on them now and is still adjusting to them. He admitted he has not been himself, which I suppose is a good thing, but I tell you, the roller coaster ride continues. I really do hope he has made a breakthrough, but I am very wary. I had all but let him go, because of the stress I was under and the pain he was causing me.

I hope your son somehow gets over his anosognosia and will become compliant with meds, since that’s the only thing I’ve seen, so far, that helps – as primitive a fix as that is. Sorry that your mother’s health is making it too hard to care for her at home. Same thing with us. My wife’s mother, who has Alzheimer’s along with about 10 other maladies, had to be sent to to a nursing home last week. Now both by MIL and son are in facilities at the same time. If that wasn’t bad enough, there is the constant worry about COVID-19 and if they might get infected in the facility. There was quite a bit of soul-searching between my wife, her father and sister about what to do with her mother. The COVID-19 problem in nursing homes was the killer. They finally found one that didn’t seem to have a problem, only to find out yesterday it was because the pl
ace had not reported its status to the CDC. When they got around to reporting their status it turns out to be bad. Now, I think, my sister and wife are talking about transferring her somewhere, possibly to her home with 24/7 nursing care."

176268714,"Okay. First, calm down. SZA can be manageable with treatment, it’s associated with better outcomes than schizophrenia, so be happy for that. Second, while _PERSON_ is heritable it’s not a sure thing at all. I have a couple ‘normal’ siblings. Third, calm down! Seriously, from what you say I think it’s unlikely you are suffering from anything other than anxiety and possibly depression at the moment. In my experience stress is a trigger for developing full blown SZA, so anything you can do to reduce stress and learn coping mechanisms and behaviors may blunt possible expression of florid SZA. If you have potential to develop SZA you are likely to be in what they call a prodrome. I didn’t develop ‘positive’ symptoms of SZA until my mid twenties, but my prodrome started around 15 or 16. Fourth, don’t take my or anyone else’s word for it— see a psychiatrist and get diagnosed. This is only a big deal if you make it a big deal. You just talk to him/her and voice your concerns and you m
ay or may not be prescribed medication. If prescribed medication, take it and follow up with counseling or talk therapy if that’s warranted. That’s what I did and I eventually finished my degree and have a career. You have a big advantage over many people in that you are aware of potential issues and have models of people who have met these challenges before. Things that helped me most in my recovery was insight into my illness and my brother’s example of what not to do as far as responding to the challenge of my illness. Above all, don’t be afraid of any potential illness, stand up to it, do what you need to do to treat it and move on with your life as best you can. If you give into fear and feel helpless, it will forever rule you, rather than you rule it."

I’ve given myself and my daughter a much needed break from the whole thing. My son is doing GREAT! The insurance was actually starting to question why they are paying for this kid who has no active psychosis and no behavioral problems. We started him on _PERSON_ and the intrusive thinking and suicidal/homicidal thoughts have almost completely ceased. No hallucinations, depression is better. His provider is convinced he was only focusing on these things from autism and he is NOT schizophrenic. I agree, but am definitely looking for signs, and probably always will be in both of the kids. Residential was the BEST choice I could have mad for him. I think he was finally able to get to the point where he is in control and able to start using some coping skills. I’ve even been able to keep him overnight twice! It’s been a huge turn around. He is

I’m unsure isolating due to COVID is particularly stress-free, there’s less direct stimulus, but uncertainty, isolation, denial of stress relieving activities all mean you’re trading one set of stressors for another.

176268756,You might be right. I just think that if what you believe is a lie you satisfy both requirements of being 1) liar 2) lying to self. I dont think you necessarily have to tell lies to someone else to be a liar. You can be really dishonest with yourself and cause yourself a lot of problems. I just think of a pathological type of liar could include sz as it is pathology and theres a whole host of thoughts that a sick person can have which cause a lot of personal turmoil which when other people hear them they think why would you ever believe that about yourself or whatever. But your point about usa is valid from a connotative definition of liar. _PERSON_ seems to be a classic liar and a liar who has lied to himself.
176268757,"_AT_MENTION_ while you can never be 100% sure, there are some rules of thumb. In my experience people take drugs for two reasons, either to distract from or escape from reality or affect their mood. So depressant and stimulant use tracks more with mood disorders like Bipolar Disorder, whereas cannabis use and the like track with Psychotic disorders like Schizophrenia. Both PTSD and SZA (the more common abbreviation for Schizoaffective Disorder) present with a mix both psychotic and mood symptoms, so the drug used may relate to the predominant symptom. PTSD is more transitory and trigger-based than SZA. Drug induced psychosis tends to fade as the drugs leave the system, but there’s evidence that prolonged drug use or even short term drug use by susceptible individuals can lead to more lasting issues or permanent damage. What they generally look for is whether symptoms fade on their own, whether drugs are found in the patients’ system and how they respond to medication. The bottom line is she sho
uldn’t be taking illegal drugs regardless. While there may be some consolation in thinking that her issue is drug induced and possibly temporary, versus of seemingly permanent organic origin, I’m not sure it matters. She needs to stop using and keeping sober will be a life-long vigil. I don’t see much of a distinction between that and taking medication and getting psychiatric help instead or in addition. One thing I’ll mention that I’ve had both psychiatrists and psychologists say to me. People should not get so hung up with chasing their tails with diagnoses. I went to a psychologist for a year and never once did she give me a DX. I ended up telling her what I thought I was, but she never said I was ‘right’. My present Psychiatrist says that no one fits a DX perfectly that they might be PTSD-ish or SZ or SZA -ish or any mix or match. Insurance companies force doctors to put down a code and that can dictate what they pay, so the DX may change based on what insurance company the patient is filing 
a claim with and so on. I pay my psychiatric bills out of my HSA, because my psychiatrist like many nowadays refuses to deal with insurance company paperwork. I could file on my own, but isn’t much worth it. Because of this, he uses some medical code that I looked up that translates to Unknown Psychotic Disorder."

176268765,"I am angry at my family member who has sz. because they only have symptoms when I am around. They act differently when others are around. I look awful these days and everyone is critical of me. My mind is becoming very slow and people are rude to me. I resent them not cleaning up, they walk away when I finish talking. They walk right through me, they bump into me. I have to feel guilty when I get mad at them, but they don’t treat me well. I am unable to get help from other people."
176268766,Idk i dont have any proof its just a strong feeling
176268767,I can’t trust. I am like a wild animal when people approach me.
176268768,"I’ve run into this as well, the “precipitating traumatic event” theory… it seems plausible in a number of sz cases I’ve personally encountered."
176268769,How about a music-themed painting such as a still life of your banjo? Or a food-themed painting such as a pot of gumbo? Or combine those ideas into a painting commemorating your recent bluegrass party.
176268770,"Yes I completely agree about living situation. Thanks I hope it goes well with your therapist. Don’t be afraid to be open, they want to help."
176268771,"oh lol, you should snack after breakfast so you don’t spoil your appetite =D"
176268772,"Thank you. Yes, I’m being very respectful of his delusions. I understand that to him they are entirely real. And yes, he is angry at his mother for calling the police, for having him hospitalized, and for having him on meds. For sure — though it manifests in different ways. He had completely gone off his meds prior to his recent episode. Of course. He had been doing so well! But that is the nature of the illness. Thanks for the warm welcome."
176268773,"I was on Lithium for about 5 years. It did nothing for my mood issues I had at the time, and it ruined my thyroid. Now, I’m on Synthroid for life."
176268774,"I think the domestic violence advisor is way out of their area of expertise when they decide they can define someone’s control of their schizophrenia so simplistically. Read other threads on the forum and you will find lots of cases of people being given advice on making their own way in their lives. Go and have your own life or stay and read about people’s experiences to try to figure out how to live with your sister Lots of threads will reveal histories where the family member with scz will have a severe issue with only one other member of the family. Sometimes it’s just with their dad, sometimes it’s just with mom, sometimes it’s just with one sibling. One family I knew personally had to deal with the sibling with scz focusing “negativity” constantly on a much younger sibling. The judge ordered her into her own housing after her time in a mental health facility ran out - due to death threats toward the younger sibling. One of the scz experts has written about a family member with s
cz who focused negativity on an infant. That family member was also removed from the home. Edited to add- each of these examples were cases of unmedicated family members."
176268775,"Yes, we have a great relationship now. I really hope that your lives continue to be better too _AT_MENTION_. This illness is sooooo very stressful, for the ill person and everyone close to them. The horrors of psychosis just are NOT understood by anyone who hasn’t experienced it. Even though my daughter was a wonderful child/adult for 32 years, the psychosis that started in March 2016 almost destroyed her, and me, before Haldol produced a miracle in Dec 2018. I was sooooo close to losing my patience totally with her, I felt my love turning to despair, my other family members thought I was nuts to keep supporting her for years, and sometimes I wondered if I should just throw her out to become homeless. I feel totally lucky now to have her with me, and cherish every day we do something together. I have almost (just almost) forgiven myself for nearly giving up on her. It was so very hard those 2.75 years of active psychosis. But if I had given up on her, she would have been lost, most likely forever
. I understand and hope and pray and hope some more for everyone with this awful illness to find some successful relief for themselves and their loved ones."
176268776,"I think I was in a funk because I was not working, home alone all day and spending the day being abused by the demons. Several days of that straight would put anyone into depression. I started the first day of orientation at my job today and felt great, got home and was very productive."
176268777,"I used to do 3 teaspoons of sugar and medium milk! Sweet was nice. But Tbh, I can’t do that much sugar anymore I’m worried about diabetes and things."
176268778,"Yes, i took them. Just now i took my noon meds. Maybe they’ll kick in soon"
176268779,"Yes it’s terrifying being real. There comes a commitment when you are real. Right now i’m very real, just came back from two days in psych ward, a depressive attack, suicidal etc… My Pdoc put me back on lithium, and waiting for it to kick in so i don’t feel as real as i feel now. Damn I have to take lithium, when I know opioids or ketamine would work, but my pdoc couldn’t prescribe it due to my stpd disorder. Glad you are back _AT_MENTION_"
176268780,I find it makes me a better nurse because it gives me an extra layer of compassion and understanding for what a lot of my patients are going through. And it means I know a lot about the system and the treatments not just because I was taught about them but because I had to experience them myself too so that I think helps me help my patients better as well.
176268781,"Thank you ! things are a lot better that my son is back in his apartment but it hurts inside as i feel i can look after him better if my husband wasn’t so stressful . I did have a talk with my husband and he kind of gets it but doesnt fully get it if you know what i mean . Right now my son is stable , i see him a few times a week and we talk and txt every day for his needs . It was my birthday a few days ago and i had breakfast with my son and it was so nice and then he surprised me and booked me a Massage (from groupon lol ) bless him , he saved a little money and wanted me to be happy , he said he loved me almost 20 times that day haha , he is so cute at times . He came to me today only for 15 min to eat something ( His visits are very short ) i still see him smiling to himself . He did tell me he felt run down and drained , im sure from his meds .

I have a serious problem with stress and this is making me not only mentally but physically sick. I worry so much about him. I am no longer sure where he is. He wont answer my calls Nothing…the paranoia and voices took control. Even a few days before he left he would look right though me when I talked to him. He became enranged over absolutely nothing.

176268796,"_PERSON_ said it before, but literally every grad student feels that way. You wouldnt be in the program if you didnt earn it. You are brilliant. You just haven’t learned everything yet, which is why you are there learning. Even Mr. Star has been a nuclear engineer since 2008 and STILL makes mistakes and has to be corrected. He feels like an idiot when that happens also. But he isn’t an idiot. Nobody in that field is an idiot. You’re all just used to being the smartest person in the room by a wide margin, and now you’re all in a place where you are evenly matched so you feel dumber by comparison."

176268806,"The rich people of the US kept running from the urban blight they left behind. Generation after generation grew up in different locations than their fathers and mothers, who lived far away from their parents hometowns (unless they had trouble making it in the World like those with mental illness, disability, or some low-income skills.) The US Government had to restrict such building to protect the food supply making the inevitable moment when all the suburbs ran into each other. The day it happened the prominent rich people got together. One man rose and said, “now we have to solve all the problems of urban blight and income inequality. We have no choice.” He was immediately shot by the others. They then climbed into a private jet and flew to Switzerland. They left behind their invalid, disabled, and insane children who spent the night howling at the moon before the location became part of low-income housing. Then the majority of the population tried to illegally cross into Canada."

176268808,"I don’t know whether or not therapy would help your son in particular, but it does have the potential to be helpful in general, even for individuals with no insight. My husband, who is incredibly smart but who has no insight into his symptoms, was seeing a psychologist for several years at my encouragement, and although he never saw it as helpful, it seemed to me that it did help increase his awareness of his inner emotional experience and improve his ability to communicate it to me -. all of which went out the window once his relapse really got underway, of course, and the psychologist was the first person he “fired”. But I agree with Maggotbrane that it probably needs to be a solutions-focused therapy (such as CBT), which focuses on managing current issues rather than exploring the childhood factors that set things into play. And the therapist would need to be experienced in working with people with lack of insight/psychotic symptoms."
176268809,_PERSON_ i think its over now i feel safer to go out in my town. Thanks.
176268810,"Thank you for that in-depth information. I do suspect that on a higher dose my son could do better, but also don’t want to be the one who pushes it. That results in creating resentment toward me on the part of my son. When my son was changed to Clozapine, research suggested that 600mg/day is a common target dose. I will again have the doctor request blood level check to see where my son is at compared to what is considered the therapeutic blood level."
176268811,Have you considered upping your clozapine? 250 mg is a pretty low dose. Just something maybe your pdoc would do.
176268812,i also really love the _NAME_… it’s great. the rhythm in the sub is really cool yea.
176268813,I was on antibiotics before being prescribed olanzapine. I think it was one of these give it a try and it’ll buy time anyway. Usually those who are diagnosed and treated earlier have better outcomes. They said it was cause my acne but I was already having a rough time in school/socially.
176268814,A lot of SCZ self-medicate with nicotine. You’d think these zillion $$$ drug companies would R&D a medication that uses the same pathway as nicotine but is safer.

176268817,"I had my son apply last week for SSI but he is determined that he is able to work and has since gotten a job at a pizza place. Is this going to affect his chances of being approved for SSI since the whole reason for applying is that his SZ interfering with his ability to work? If not, how much is he able to earn and receive benefits? I’m not sure if he will actually be able to hold the job but if he is then I guess he doesn’t really need the SSI anyway."

176268819,I have been paying into dental insurance for about five years but I don’t want to go. I’m not afraid of any pain the dentist could cause I just don’t want to throw up.

I think I’m so heartsick it makes me want to puke . Is that crazy? Any advice?
176268820,"Thank you both for your reply. I will talk to my employee assistance program, but I don’t think guardianship would be approved. My wife has never been hospitalized and is likely not dysfunctional enough.

176268835,"Thank you. I’m thinking this needs to be the end. This has happened so many times with him. We’ve been together 11 years. Off and on because he can’t/wont remain stable. He is constantly going off and on medication. He will go off and start taking vitamins. Claiming they are helping and he doesn’t need meds. But it always ends with him freaking out, hallucinating that I’m sneaking men in the house at night and cheating on him. Or hearing things in my attic and getting scared. He would start not sleeping at all. Going out at all hours of the night driving around. Visiting his old haunts where he smoked crack. He would get very secretive and not tell me anything. Many nights he would come in my room and sleep on the floor because he was scared. He became convinced my house was haunted and he was hearing ghosts. We slept in separate rooms because he stayed up all night playing video games or playing this awful music on his phone. The music is these HEAVY LOUD bass beats with fast ticking mus
ic in the background (I hate it). Recently he had confessed to me about his voices. They talk to him all the time. He said especially when he’s driving and they get mean, yelling at him. So he plays the bass music in his truck so loud hes going def and I assume he’s trying to drown them out. I hope I can be strong when he comes around in a month or two like he always does. My house has been so peaceful since he’s been gone."
176268836,"Hi _PERSON_, I also believe exercise and getting outdoors are the best suggestions. If you are having trouble considering exercise on its own or need more outside motivation to do so, perhaps volunteering doing something like picking up trash in a park, helping at a food pantry or walking dogs at a shelter would be good? I have always found that volunteering provides that social element to help me isolate less. I’m not a “group” person, so things like book clubs or yoga classes are not my favorite alternatives, and volunteering is less demanding; you come in and do what you need to do and it’s your choice to engage with others or not."
176268837,"I understand your upset over your son’s food waste and bad nutrition. I think it is a common problem with this disease. Please try not to blame yourself for his choices. It is so very hard to accept and understand that the hallucinations and delusions your son has about eating are governing his choices. Without medication, unless your son has a very strong will to overcome his false ideas, they will not change, as he believes he is correct in all of his decisions. _AT_MENTION_ is spot on with his post. Everything changed in my household when my daughter was properly medicated. If your son is unmedicated, then one tiny improvement at a time is the best you can hope for in his eating. Somewhere in what he says to you when you talk to him about food will be a key to getting him to eat something he likes. Will he go food shopping with you? I took my daughter weekly while unmedicated and said, “Pick out 10 things you think are good for you to eat and put them in the cart”. Besides that, I always o
ffered her an already made up plate of good food at dinnertime, before I made my own plate. If she didn’t take it, I then ate it myself. She would go out to restaurants with me and eat her food (while talking to herself and her “friends”). None of the other customers paid attention. And only once was she kicked out of WalMart, so the shopping trips usually worked."
176268838,"Thank you for the info. I have printed it and will forward this info. to his therapist and probation officer. Unfortunately, he will not qualify as he has Never been hospitalized, like I said he is very smart and his paranoia has always prohibited him from getting close and does not share ALL of what is going on in his head with anybody. I have begged the courts upon his release from jail to court order mental health and asked for mental health court to over see him. They all but ignored my requests, I am sure due to the fact that he has a past record and the DA wanted so badly to put him in prison the last time he was in trouble. I fought with everything I had and ended up hiring an attorney to keep him in jail and not prison for 1 yr. So they are not interested in helping him, especially since he accuses them of things. The system is for sure messed up. He has been in foster care all his life and in the system, never had appropriate mentoring or love that every child deserves and needs. He is now 
30, and suffering from all that neglect and his biological mother was a heavy drug user, we have very little history. I am not his biological mother and have no legal rights which makes it harder. However, the courts, probation, DA all know who I am from dealing with this for the last 8 years, I also work where we provide Transitional Housing for former foster youth, this is how I met him, so I know the resources but have learned first hand how difficult it is to navigate. We have to make such hard boundaries with him as he is not (most of the time) in the real world with his thoughts and perceptions, although if you ask him, he says he is fine and definitely does not have a mental illness and refuses to take medication EVER as he is not sick. Anosognosia. I was able to have a private meeting with the DA years ago, trying to keep him from prison the last stint and she said he is nothing but a criminal, I was horrified and said this could be your son, brother, neighbor and it is up to us to help in any way we 
can. It is day at a time! Thank you for your support and I wish you the best as well."

176268841,"Thanks for all your words of advice, warnings and encouragement. I appreciate you all taking the time out of your day to reply to me. You all deserve a reward from God for helping me. A psychiatrist on £70,000 a year hasn’t helped me as much as the people on this forum have. My sister has now decided to travel to another country to do a degree course. She’s selling all her stuff. I give up now on what the right path is for her. Perhaps it’s God telling me to let go of her. It’s just hard because I worry so much about her and will actually miss her. I can’t work out whether it’s this illness that’s making her so disruptive all the time or whether it will actually help her recovery getting away from where we currently live as she admittedly doesn’t have a life here at the moment. I have decided to mentally let go, do my duty as an older sister and look out for her where I can, but I can’t stop a grown adult deciding on where she wants to spend her life, even if her decision is tota
lly wrong in my eyes. God works in mysterious ways and perhaps this is another mysterious way in which He is working. Sometimes I just wish He would tell me if I and her are on the right path or not, but I guess He doesn’t roll like that and that is what the meaning of “having faith” is. Trusting in Him while you walk in a dense darkness that is dotted with broken glass and failed dreams, dragging yourself along and other people with you."

176268853,"Agree with _AT_MENTION_, you never know which drug will work as far as symptoms go, and going in with a negative attitude about a drug and drugs in general is rarely helpful. Read the drug information sheets looking carefully and look at percentages of reported side-effects, they are far more scientific and less biased than anecdotal caregiver and diagnosed opinions. They report all info in the studies, just because one person out of thousands in a trial reports something, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a delusion, and even if a side-effect isn’t imagined or is measurable, it doesn’t mean everyone who takes a drug experiences it. Keep an open mind, and give it a chance. Don’t give up before you even try."

176268861,"Yes. He has been working full time in a professional capacity and historically has been very popular with a lot of friends. And even in this state, he has the capacity to comfort me (when he is not overly focused on suspicions of my intent). Probably because his break occurred later in life, he mostly has “positive” symptoms (i.e. delusions, auditory/visual hallucinations) and very little in the way of cognitive or negative symptoms. He did respond well to medications before so probably has the potential to do so again, if he decides he is willing to try again. But he has never been aware that he is ill, which complicates things. I’m wondering if the “cognitive issues” you mention are cognitive issues only or if some of what you are considering “cognitive” are negative symptoms of the disorder (which typically do not respond well to medication). For example, when you talk about wanting conversations and closeness but not being able to get it, this could be due to negative symptoms (wh
ich historically have not responded well to antipsychotic medication). Apparently there is a new medication in the pipeline that does help with negative symptoms. Looks like I deleted the link and I only skimmed the article as it didn’t seem very helpful for my particular situation, but it might be worth talking to his care team about this."
176268862,Yes! Communication. Are you taking care of your brother?
176268863,"You are in the right place to get support and hope! I’ve been told that it is extra difficult to medicate teenage boys for psychosis because the hormones complicate everything so much. My son is 15, and honestly he didn’t respond to any of the newer anti-psychotics too well. He is on Thorazine and it is finally making a difference and then he hopes to switch to Haldol for weight reasons (another older drug). I wish I had more wisdom to share. All I know is that every individual can react SO differently to the medications. If you stick with it, there will be something that helps your son. I am so sorry you are going through this. No one expects to see their chold suffer like this. But don’t lose hope! This is such a wonderful forum and you can learn a lot here."

176268865,"I know how you feel regarding triggering events. It’s wonderful the empathy you have for your neighbor. Looking back on our experience with my sons diagnosis ten years ago it would have been great to have a neighbor who understood our struggle. Our neighbors are totally cool but we were silent about what we were going through, it’s pretty much impossible to share with someone you’re not close too. If you can let them know you have some understanding coupled with a few kind words it would probably go a long way in providing some comfort for her and her family."
176268866,"When psychotic apparently I had word salad for a few weeks. However, I thought I was conversing with people and saying the right things This seems strange to me that reality to me felt like I was having a perfectly normal conversation, but yet the doctors couldn’t understand a word I was saying Just wondered if anyone here had something similar, and felt they were talking properly and getting appropriate responses from recipient, yet being way off base. I don’t understand this specific symptom and how you c an even comprehend this even being possible?"
176268867,"I understand that you wonder how this happened. I don’t think anyone knows how psychosis happens, especially if it isn’t drug induced. You are correct that there is only so much you can do to help her, and the others in your family who are affected by her. Your SIL should be warned now that she will need to get a hotel for her next court date, so it doesn’t become a scene if she finds out too close to that date. Sometimes the person can be normal and up emotionally, and then like a flash be hallucinating and down emotionally. I will never forget my daughter’s physical power when she chased me through the house and grabbed me prior to my first call to the police about her (and her first forced hospitalization). She was shockingly strong. I am lucky that others were home to hear my cry for help. I felt so bad calling the police, but I felt I had no choice. Take care of yourself."
176268868,"_AT_MENTION_ I see what you are saying. Some of his reasons for anger towards me are actual events, me leaving, vs some imagined like me being unfaithful. I agree that he is upset over my ultimatum to take medicine and him not having access to me and our child anymore. And yes, I think he wanted to rush to do it “first” and he is very emotional. All of this has caused me so much stress. I also feel the _USER_ID_ of this illness as people have questioned me loving him and being married to him. I understand why someone with SZ would want to hide the diagnosis. However, hiding something like this does more harm than anything in the end. I would like to think that love can overcome anything."
176268869,Wow. I’m very hopeful it works for you!
176268870,"Thank you old lady blue. I have a knot in my stomach everyday. I know is coming, the day he gets again. I am preparing myself and yet, how do one prepare themself to see their son or daughter sick. I didn’t know about the shot, I only wish my son would get the shot, but he is in denial. May I ask where you live? Florida’s laws when it comes to taking someone to have them evaluated is terrible. They need to find that the person wants to hurt someone or themself, crazy right?"

176268880,"I’ve served on a jury twice and called for duty four or five times. They didn’t ask me about any illness at all, mental or otherwise. They did ask about my occupation. I can’t get into the details, but I feel my experience with my illness was relevant in both cases, and if I hadn’t served it may not have been fully a jury of peers. I don’t think it changed the adjudication either way, as the only relevant thing was being able to interpret the law and follow instructions. Laws generally don’t take SMI into account unless in rare cases where insanity or guilty but insane defenses are employed. I was not involved with any sentencing, my experience may have been relevant in that case, but that would depend on the instructions and sentencing guidelines. Generally you are encouraged to speak with the judge privately if there’s a possible issue with you serving. I had prior knowledge of a newspaper article about a case in question, so I spoke to the judge about it, and he asked if it would i
nterfere with applying the law and following instructions and I said no. Bear in mind that there’s also a minor amount of voir dire questioning from the lawyers, but it’s very minimal. I thought it was a good experience and I was paid a token amount for my time (I didn’t cash the checks, as my employer paid for the jury time) If you don’t think it might trigger him in some way, as there is the potential to see difficult crime scene evidence and testimony, and you think he can think clearly enough to interpret the law and jury instructions, I would leave it to the judge to decide."

There are studies that indicate it can be a factor in onset and exacerbate existing psychosis. I don’t know much about CBT oil, although I’ve seen it used in animals to calm them. Sometimes alcohol will mix with medication and increase any sedative effect, but it’s manageable in moderation and self limiting. I agree a certain degree of feeling ‘normal’ can help with recovery, what you want to watch for is dependence. I’m not much of a drinker or smoker (cigarettes or otherwise), but I do have a caffeine problem at times and have to take care I don’t overdo it."

Almost as if they KNEW that their child would suffer no matter what and that they were the one that DID it to them. Is that true for you? Did you KNOW and then disregard? Hope for the best? I asked my friend once, “Do you BELIEVE that you could have controlled the outcome? Or do you somehow feel as if the way you enforced or didn’t enforce certain regulations as a parent caused the disease to exacerbate itself?” She thought a moment. No. I don’t think so, they said. I understand it’s genetic… they said.

Please, PLEASE, do not be so hard on yourself, I am sure you are doing the best you can. This dreaded disease is like playing pick-up-stix, the combinations of factors are endless, and moving one factor can change the whole game for the better or the worse. Even the doctors and nurses and civil servants have to take their best guesses, and it feels horrible to guess, and then second guess, what should happen or what should have happened."

If he’s in an OK place and I get a phone call, it’s OK, but if he’s not, then it’s one of the conspirators contacting me. Or if I’m leaving for work and a neighbor happens to be pulling out at the same time, he may be worried about me (that they are going to follow me and harass me) or he may get angry with me because I set it up. Keeps me on edge and makes things at home definitely not normal. Thus my recent renting of my own space when I need some down time.

176268897,"I am so sorry and appreciate all that you have shared. My experience with guardianship is that judges grant guardianships very reluctantly unless it is clear that the person is repeatedly of danger to himself or others. You will need lots of facts to that regard (repeated hospitalizations is a good one). There can be differing degrees of guardianship/ conservatorship, which may or may not include control of the person’s assets. Meds cannot be forced (at least in my state) even with a guardianship, however, it seems to make giving meds involuntarily a bit easier, especially if the person is not responsive. They just don’t hold people down to give meds! With a guardianship, you CAN have say over where the person is. A professional case manager told me that if the person wanders off or disappears, you can legally have them picked up and transported somewhere (possibly at your own expense?)"

He is working on simple day to day care plan (simple to me not for him) but his day only consists of him getting up staying out of his room and showering washing his cloths - he is talking a little bit( we call it poverty speech) not a lot of conversation- but he 
is trying and of course we love him - he really struggles to do those task - he has been in hospital for 2 and a half months and will be there for a bit I think which is ok because he is getting the help he needs - sorry I have lost my focus - but thank you for responding to my comment"
176268909,"I highly doubt that changing the name of schizophrenia will do anything to reduce the _USER_ID_. Changing the name of manic depression to bipolar did nothing to lessen _USER_ID_. In fact, it worsened it. Changing the name of schizophrenia to psychosis spectrum disorder will worsen _USER_ID_ because it sounds like “psycho” which has very bad connotations in the public mind. It also sounds like “psychopath” which also has negative connotations."
176268910,Took my morning meds.
176268911,So I started Clozapine about a year ago… the last resort med for my schizophrenia… I went to the hospital about a year and a half ago they wouldn’t let me try it because of my weight and fear of “diabetes”… at the time I was like 2010 pounds and desperate and they gave me a med that was supposedly like Clozapine… it gave me dystonia along with a few other meds. Well I can tell you what… I went to a different hospital and they questioned me… I told them all the meds I was on previously. Without me asking they suggested clozapine… ever since I started clozapine I feel better and able to ignore my voices telling me to self harm or run away. They still make me cry but lately that has not been an issue for me… my point with all this is that I lost weight on clozapine… I’m down to 160. OSU _PERSON_ helped me out a lot… if god forbid you need to have a psychiatric stay at a hospital I would recommend OSU. They listen… and I’m now still losing the weight and willing to do mor

176268915,"Hello! So sorry you’ve joined this club. There are great people here and awesome advice. I recommend browzing around this forum, it has helped me immensely! My son diagnosed schizoaffective at 16, 12 long hospital stays, tons of treatment programs and many, many medications later we tried the ‘big guns’ last resort, Clozaril. This medication has helped my severely impaired son to live in our house, in the community. He was a hot mess for 3 years until I screamed that I wanted Clozaril implemented. Do some research here and elsewhere, but that is what saved my son’s life 100%. I understand the barely graduating as I had to put my son in a lock down in Texas (were Californian) to graduate. He was a hot mess - completely reckless, manic, agitated/aggressive, delusional, awkward socially and complete with a heavy dose of anosognosia (a symptom where he is unaware to acknowledge his symptoms/illness). He knows that if he stays with me, which he loves and I spoil him greatly, he HAS to take his m
edication. It is not negotiable at all, period. If he even mentions that he wants to skip his med, I show him the shelter list/phone numbers. I have been to so many SMI seminars and I’m always told that early intervention is most important and key to a successful recovery. It’s been 1 year and NO hospitalizations - amazing! But knowing that the meds could stop working anytime, I’m still holding my breath, like so many others. Best of luck finding the right medication for your son, it’s no easy job, but I find that parents have the strongest fight in them. _PERSON_"

176268923,That is my next step. I’m getting things together now to send to the Board of Nursing of Texas. I always thought that when I reported her to the Board of Nursing that she would then try to tell me I could not come by to see my sister there. But she didn’t wait that long. She did this to a family member of another Resident there. That lady’s sister was close to dying and the RN read a negative review that the family member had put on the BBB website. When BBB contacted the RN she told the family member they could not come by to see their dying sister. The dying lady’s sister was finally called the day before the resident died and told she should come see her because she was going to die at any time. The RN has been in business over 20 years and she has three private homes with people in them. I cannot say that I’m okay with hearing that she has done this to another family but I’m glad I know because there is power in numbers.
176268924,"_AT_MENTION_ My best suggestion is to establish boundaries that are right and reasonable for you. You could also have an “agreement” with your family member. This is what YOU can do based on certain things that HE does. If he does not follow the agreement, then you cannot hold up your end of the agreement. It has to be reasonable…you can’t expect your family member to be completely normal, especially if not getting treatment. Can you go to a _USER_ID_ Family Support Group to help you with this?"

176268927,My former pdoc of 22 years told me that my mild cognitive impairment was caused by the sza and not by the AP meds.
176268928,"_AT_MENTION_, I have been following your inspiring posts for a while now. My son diagnosed with sza (after Sz diagnosis few years ago) is on Risperidone, Seroquel, lithium and epival for over a year now. Despite so many meds, he’s no where near relative normalcy. His positive symptoms are relentless , with anger and delusions. He’s constantly yelling at the voices(they are nasty I think!!). He doesn’t have much negative symptoms…he showers, dresses well, motivated to do courses, online volunteer work and so on. It’s the voices in the evening that distract him enough to throw up his hands and stop doing any school work. It’s heartbreaking! He’s trying really hard! _PERSON_, he claims he’s not talking to any voices!! He’s apparently preparing for a speech and hence the soliloquy From your posts I’m thinking should I try starting my son on Amyloban 3399?? Does it help quieten the voices? Since he doesn’t have much negative symptoms, would the Amyloban set off mania? The boy’s p
roblem right now is the disruptive angry voices. The APs are doing nothing. The pdoc doesn’t think he needs to change anything. The reason I’m worried about Amyloban triggering mania is, in the past he became manic after the psych. started him on Rexulti (oh boy! Crazier times!) and he went totally manic, got arrested etc. After a year another psych. thought he might need an antidepressant and we added Pristiq to the cocktail of drugs. The boy went off the rails within 2 weeks and had be hospitalized. So he was then thought to have sza and not sz! So I guess my question is, is there a danger of _PERSON_ setting off another manic episode? Sorry about the long post and thanks for reading this. Best wishes!"
176268929,"The only thing that worked with my son when he was manic, wandering the streets all night, becoming so thin because of his mania was convincing him that he needed medication and needed to be hospitalized. It took a while but eventually his mind go so messed up he wanted help. He is now stable after a year and some medication changes. The weight gain is making him anxious now so he wants to get off the very meds that made him stable. Around and around we go."
176268930,"Welcome to this forum. I am sorry you and your girlfriend are going through this. I highly suggest you do as _AT_MENTION_ suggests and read, read, read on what sz is, and what it means to someone’s life. Also, read everything you can find on this site from those who supported their spouse when sz hit. If she is successfully medicated, the future can still be bright. If she doesn’t successfully medicate, the long term rocky road ahead will be hard to navigate. _AT_MENTION_ is right, take care of yourself, and be there and encourage her. She needs you right now."
176268931,"_AT_MENTION_, I know it doesn’t seem like it now, but the best thing that can happen to your son is being picked up by authorities where they will hopefully take him to the hospital, and where hopefully the medical staff will see how ill he really is and admit him. My son left on foot 6 years ago, didn’t come home for 2 days. Police found him sleeping on a hot car (this was in June), with his face down on the hood of the car. He still has a scar on his cheek to this day from the burn. The police found him, and they did the right thing. They didn’t bring him home, they didn’t take him to jail, they took him to the hospital. Hospital staff called me that night to ask if I suspected my son had been using drugs. I said absolutely not and that it was a mental issue, and that he had not been well for years, and that I had been trying to get him into a hospital or a doctor for an evaluation/meds. They said they could not tell me anything because of HIPPA laws, but that my information to them was v
ery helpful to determine the next course of action. I did reach out to them the next day, and I asked if it was drug related, all they said was, “no, you were correct. No drugs found in his system”. From there he was admitted to a long term psychiatric ward and stayed for 3-4 months where he was evaluated and where they found the right combo of meds for him. When I visited him in the beginning he looked at me with hatred and hostility and anger. As time went on, the longer he stayed, the softer he became. He came out of the hospital a different person (in a good way). We have had a few major setbacks since that first time, where he ended up back in the hospital again several times, mostly because he decided to cold turkey and stop the meds. The right med is everything. Today he realizes he cannot just cold turkey the meds, and he also realizes he needs them. Very thankful that he knows this. It took a lot of suffering on his part I think to make him realize. My son went thru hell, as I’m sure some of th
e other sz loved ones on here. Please know that your son being picked up and the police hopefully doing the right thing and taking him to the hospital and not jail is the best thing that can happen to your son. With the right meds, you will see your old son again. Praying for his safety and him getting the help he needs."
176268932,u have any tips how to stop thinking those thoughts?
176268933,I understand that you are frustrated. I still say you need to forget about your old pdoc though and move on. She has no influence over you anymore. Just concentrate on staying/getting well.

176268936,I’m not amazing. I just know talking about my unusual beliefs will get me nowhere. No one believes me. I don’t even think my pdoc believes that i really believe im being followed etc. I continue to report it to her but it doesn’t matter. No drug changes help me. Nothing helps me. I don’t know what to do anymore. If my pdoc thinks I’m faking i’m in real trouble. I think she turned against me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be followed etc anymore but im powerless to fix it.
176268937,"My second psychiatrist told me the same thing but only because I am male. She said once men hit their 40s they tend to improve, while women tend to get worse when they hit their 40’s. I’m 43 and my 40’s have been better than my 20’s and 30’s so maybe there is some truth to it."
176268938,"I can’t drink regular coffee at all. I get totally irrational and do things that aren’t good for me. I got some cafe latte sachets that I sometimes drink once a day, but it only has 15% coffee in it, but I seem to be able to handle that."
176268939,"Thanks for the update, _AT_MENTION_. I had been thinking about you and wondering how things were going. My husband continues to take the Vraylar and his psychotic symptoms are improving. He’s doing very well with me in the house at this point, and is a bit more relaxed in his interactions outside the house (which are still pretty minimal). The Vraylar is causing him to gain weight and seems to be interfering with his sleep. I suggested he call his psychiatrist before going up from 1.5mg to 3mg (as his symptoms were improving at the lower dose, so why take more of something that is leading to sleep issues/weight gain unless you really need to?) But he didn’t want to so it didn’t. Ah well. I’m not doing so well myself. He seems to bounce back relatively quickly, in part I think because he doesn’t really remember the bad parts once he’s gotten through them - seems like an internal Endless Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Sure wish I had that! On the positive side, it’s a lot easier for me 
to feel safe and relaxed at home and to engage in needed self care when he is no longer so paranoid and hostile. On the other hand, I have really lost the sense of having a spouse/partner/best friend that I was able to hold onto during his initial break - probably because he was only really paranoid about me for 2-3 months before he started medication vs. 9 months this time. Or maybe because I was very active in getting him help the first time and this time he just wanted to have nothing to do with me. I have to say, I am feeling rather lost. I had never dated much and I never planned to marry, but then I fell in love and a lot of my identity seems somehow to have gotten caught up in my relationship with my spouse. I feel like I’m walking around with nothing inside me right now. Weird."

176268942,"_AT_MENTION_ You’re right, I posted this before starting to re-read _PERSON_’s book yesterday from the beginning. He says that insight does not have to mean you acknowledge you have a mental illness before you start taking meds. Acknowledgment of illness first, then taking drugs sounds logical to me, but as you point out, acknowledgement will not happen if a person has anosognosia. So why would anyone take meds if they they think they’re being prescribed for an illness they don’t have? _PERSON_ gives the following reasons: 1) It might make the family member feel better (see _PERSON_’ post about her son going back on meds to “feel better”), e.g. suppress annoying voices and 2) please other people so they won’t land back in the hospital. Can you think of any other motivators? I’m pretty sure my son will stop taking meds once he gets out of the hospital."

176268946,"O.K, time for a new perspective to be made this time its the uncanny relationship between cancel culture and the sociopathic nature of what or how the 'voices' conduct themselves. I have paid close attention to the various mind games they vainly attempt to play upon an unwitting unsuspecting victim, everything from trying to entrap me or for me to spoon-feed them so embarrassing or harmful information through self-talk or at best subvocalization. They attempt blackmail so offered it seems like kangaroo court multiple times an hour, they Mobb up with their shared hate projects what they collectively are on to the hapless victim in order to have provable evidence against the intended recipient. Even by being totally aware of what's being done to them is a clear sign for the mob to have an ethical judgment to convict to exile or banishment from the normal everyday experience of people and life, as it will look like a nightmare although very sly and subtle within they collective approach. Another game 
is to play a game of charades whereby you guess the last word of a sentence or chosen toxic topic. By guessing what you were trying to say or write proves they have power over you or your thought process. Another one is to belittle your attempts to help yourself whether it's writing a post, applying for work, or studying, it does not take much to set these low lives against you. Or they like to 'call you out' this seems to be more popular amongst them at the moment, they love to dig up any **** you think about trying to work out who set this situation up in the first place. These are just a few as I would end up writing a book. Would love to hear back from anyone who can relate to what I am saying here."

176268961,"My son will soon be 40 and as someone had mentioned in this thread, a mother always looks at their son as if they are still that young boy. I had guardianship at one time, which I really did not want to be but the psychiatrist at one of the hospitals didn’t want to go through probate to keep him hospitalized. He gave me the required expert evaluation so I would file for guardianship. The doctor told me that my son hit him and he was going to press charges if I did not get guardianship. As time went by, in and out of hospital, the medical staff was able to talk to me and I was able to give them authority for whatever treatment. However, today my son is now under a county system, AOT team and that psychiatrist felt that me being his mother and guardian is hindering his recovery. So I was not able to renew the annual guardianship, which in a way I was relieved. My son was recently in a hospital for 2.5 months and was just transferred to the state hospital. I haven’t been able to receive any inform
ation from the AOT team. Yesterday I attend a seminar for caregivers. The key point I got out of that seminar was a Patient-Centered Goal. I learned it is very important that the patient has input into what he/she wants. However, the patient can not relay this without the help of the caregiver to advocate for him/her. So last night I wrote a lengthy letter to the AOT team with a history of _NAME_ prior to 2015 before he has had over 30 hospitalizations, his medication compliance in the past, and the three incidents that prevented him from getting his medication that was beyond his control. Each time he became more and more delusional and non-compliant with medication. I prayed that the director of the AOT would acknowledge that she received and read the document. She replied within a few hours, thanked me and asked if she could share with the team. I took this as a positive. I realized that putting him back in the group home, which he has stated on more than one occasion is torture for him. I was ignoring his 
request until I learned from the seminar. My son will be 40, the group homes (he has been in two) are majority of young men. I pray that they will be able to work to get through to my son so we, which is my son, me and the medical team work together with the goal of him having his own apartment. My son first got sick the beginning of his senior year in college and he did finish and got his architect degree; worked 13 years, got married and had a home, and always was medication compliant. In 2015 his psychiatrist switched his medications."

176268963,"Anosognosia makes it so difficult for our family members to agree to take meds - or even go see a doctor. Confabulation isn’t just something they make up to tell us, like your brother thinking he is talking to the dead, they earnestly believe the confabulations. We are taught to believe what we actually see and hear, its a harsh reality that the voices register on their brain exactly the same as a real person talking. I’m sorry your brother has turned to street drugs for relief, our family members can become addicted, making your family’s struggle even harder. Are you using Dr _PERSON_’s LEAP techniques when you talk with your brother?"
176268964,"Hello Threelittkebirds. Welcome here. If ever you or your loved one or their doctors ever have any questions or concerns about medications and their effects or their interactions to other medications, I’ve always suggested calling a pharmacist.

When I met him he had a lengthy criminal record all related to drugs/drinking. He has a mother who had enough and move away to another state. His father lives close by on some property he bought. _NAME_ has 2 younger brothers. Both alcohol and drug problems. One lives for free in a trailer on his dad’s property. The other is currently living in dad’s house that is for sale. Neither work. _NAME_ gets $600/month in disability. He pays his car insurance and cell phone bill. Their dad has always taken care of them. I have gone through SO many break ups and reconciliations from his erratic and crazy behavior. He gets an Abilify injection once a month. And Vistiril for anxiety. He weighs 300+ and eats every 2 hours. He sleeps 75% of the time. I got tired of living with a zombie. All he does is sleep and eat. It’s gotten worse l
ately because he got in a minor car wreck in February and called an ambulance chaser lawyer. Sent him to a pain clinic. Now he’s hooked on pain pills. Oxycodone, percocet, loritabs. sigh So that’s our story. Oh I work full time and own a home. I have a good job, car, house, etc. I’m sober 1 year. Me and him used to be soulmates but lately I feel like he doesn’t care. When we met he was living in a RV in his dad’s driveway. He moved in with me but it has been rocky.

Through our time together i have learnt a whole lot and also lost a part of who i was. When we used to have arguments in the beginning i always fought back and the rows would get so intense and really quite bad. As the time has gone on i have found just sitting there and being quiet and not responding to his thoughts in a negative way is the best way. Although it makes me feel like a wilted flower i just cant win or even get hime to see my view. I do feel like i am just one fighting my own corner and he has 7 fighting in his. I love him so very much and prepared to stick by him but i do worry it will take away who i am. Will i still be me and grow as a person or will i be chipped away and get lost. I dont know how to get stronger as i feel like im weakening. I cant talk to his family or even mine as noone knows he has

The dosages mentioned and sedation effects are more in line with Risperedal. Effects of drugs vary with the individual, but to my eyes something seems a little off— maybe she’s just very sensitive to AP medication. The good news is I doubt you’d see much difference in AP effect as she titrates down from levels as low as these. _USER_ID_, I looked up dosage information: typical dosages are 10-15 mg for SZ and Bipolar Disorder, 2-5 mg for adjunct therapy with an antidepressant. Smallest tablet size is indeed 2 mg."
176269012,Sorry. That sucks. I thought they were a good solution over more pills.

176269017,"I was able to buy a life insurance policy on myself, as I am in relatively good health. I started a trust to receive the life insurance money, and named my son and my youngest sister-in law as trustees. My home will pass to the trust, as will any other assets I have. The home will be included in the trust and maintained by my son until my daughter dies then it will pass to my sons. The trust funds assisted by the rental income from my back house rental will allow my husband and my daughter to continue to live in the house, and I hope it will all go OK. My husband has agreed to follow my wishes should I die before him. I hope he will, as otherwise my will is invalid as far as the house goes, since Florida law gives a wife’s possessions to the husband and he COULD sell it out from under my daughter. But in that case, the life insurance policy will still go to the trust so there will be money for her, though not a lifelong residence. The lawyer that I hired to do my papers gave me his services for f
ree in the end since he felt for my situation with my daughter and her illness and my husband and his alcoholism. He suggested I stay married to my husband as selling the house would jeopardize the future since it has guaranteed income. At that time, I was fed up and wanted a divorce. I am mostly managing my husband and his alcoholism (with medical marijuana which he began under my insistence last year) as I am managing my daughter’s medication and life since I asked the judge for forced medication almost 2 years ago. Everyone’s quality of life is greatly improved. I didn’t count on the lawyer doing the work for me pro bono, that was a blessing I didn’t expect. The lawyer made all of the suggestions I implemented, I wouldn’t have known exactly what to do otherwise. I highly suggest getting help to make suggestions for your family to be cared for as far into the future as you can."

176269021,"_AT_MENTION_…You are wonderful to step in this situation and you seem to have made a good assessment of the situation. Does your aunt take any medication for this illness at all? Does she see a doctor? Housing is a major problem area for persons with mental illness, in general. I suggest you list the short term and long term pros and cons of various options, but here are some thoughts: First, I highly suggest you get connected with a local _USER_ID_ Family Support Group. (https://naminebraska.org/) Learn all you can about schizophrenia. There are a number of good books. Resources are on the _USER_ID_ website. Read the book “I Am Not Sick; I Don’t Need Help”. This book introduces us to a communication method called LEAP that may be our only real hope to help our loved ones who are not voluntarily seeking the help they need. I like this page for an introduction: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtTWLV77dUj4vwsjlwCOs0Q THEN…AFTER you have done the things above… You could fix up the propert
y without going to extremes, given her history of destruction. Are there other advantages (or disadvantages) of keeping this property? This will best have potential to be helpful IF you have a good relationship with your aunt (See #3 above re: LEAP) There is not much of anything that coordinates across state lines. Getting connected with a _USER_ID_ Family Support Group, and especially taking a _USER_ID_ Family to Family Class (all programs are provided at no cost), is one of the best things I ever did. Many _USER_ID_ programs are being offered on a virtual basis at this time. You’re right. It is hard to get someone in patient help in most states because they aren’t of harm to their self or to others. But don’t give up on that. There may be a moment when it is the right time to call your and ask for a (CIT) Crisis Intervention Team, depending on what is offered in your state. There is SO much more to be learned than I can post here, but you are off to a good start! Best wishes!!"
176269022,"Yep! Co - Diagnosis of “EUPD Traits” . Complete load of bollox in my opinion, purely on the record to cover up the last shrinks flaming cock up. Hate to say it, but schizophrenia “suits me” - Its the only Dx that makes any sense for my condition and what i experience."
176269023,"Ok, in my personal opinion these sound like intense delusions because I actually had these last month. I think, if there is a possibility you should talk to someone who can bring you back to reality, be it a therapist, a loved one, or a psychiatrist. Because these thoughts don’t seem to be rooted in reality from my own experience. I know it’s hard and simply telling you to not believe it is easier said than done, but just take small steps, don’t let your mind wander beyond those delusions or any thought you think is unhealthy. I don’t know your emotional state or your hobbies, but what I do is take my mind off things and read a book or drink some tea, just something that can ease your mind off those delusions. I wish you well!"
176269024,"I didn’t realize until right now, when I read your post again, _AT_MENTION_, that when my daughter told the judge in the courtroom that “that isn’t my mother” that she must have perceived me as someone else at that time. I really appreciate your posts as the insight you share helps me. Another thing that helped me to communicate and really do L and E (listen and empathize) is when I stopped being afraid of my daughter. It was very hard for me to remain calm when she started saying and doing things that I just COULD NOT understand. The instructor at the _USER_ID_ class said that most (greater than 95%) of those with mental illness will not get violent, if they never got violent pre-illness. That helped calm my fears. My daughter never did get truly violent. She said some things that were weird enough that she was force hospitalized 5 times (could be taken threateningly). If I remained calm during those times, everything went better. If I stayed clear-headed and remembered her exact statement
s, then the police could usually get her talking about that idea again. That would help the police and the CIT team take her for hospitalization when it really was needed. One time she said “Everyone in this house should be dead”, which was more a feeling than a threat, but I listened and understood and got her to go back calmly to her room. Then, I called the police and they came quickly. She was still in the mood to talk about how “everyone should be dead” and she was taken to the hospital."
176269025,"Anyone have negative voices when attempting masturbation? Anytime I even think about masturbation a kid who’s psychically connected to me goes off like an alarm and alerts the other voices to prevent me from doing so by: banging on walls, yelling, stomping, shaming. The kid also alerts everyone for my brother for the same thing. The external voice that’s outside almost 24/7 starts threatening to kill him. Then again this could extremely crazy narcissistic neighbors who hacked my phone and computer, installed cameras and mics and has a psychic relative who can read every thought I have."

176269036,"For me it hinders in terms of practical daily living skills. See Investigating the factors underlying adaptive functioning in autism in the EU?AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project I get quite a lot of support for that from my stepdaughter, and to a lesser extent my granddaughters. I did get support from a care agency,but it was cheaper to hire an individual while at the same time paying her more than she’d previously got working for a care agency. The fact she was also cleaning at a school where there’d been a Covid outbreak meant I had to stop using her. There is very little professional support in this county for autistic adults. Socially it affects me a lot . While I have excellent verbal intelligence my social communication level was rated 3( classical autism level) when I was being assessed. I’ve had very few friends in 64 years. I’ve never had a paid job . I don’t drive. As well as the ASD & schizophrenia/schizoaffective . There’s clumsiness & odd gait,poor hand-eye coordinat

176269043,"Thank you for your kind words, _NAME_. I have been feeling like a very unsympathetic, intolerant and impatient sister. I have been guilty of eye rolling and saying “oh come on, really?!” Focusing on LEAP (listen, empathize, agree, partner…right?) has made a big difference, so that when I listen to my sister and acknowledge how it must feel for her, she then listens to what I have to say more readily. We have reached an understanding whereby I agree that some of the things she tells me are true (people do avoid her), and some things I consider unlikely (like a viral website about her) could possibly be true. My sister subsequently agrees that she could possibly be mistaken about some of the things she perceives (such as people following her down the street). I encourage her to consider “that person on their phone might be taking my photo, but it is also possible they are just sending a text”. I don’t know if it’s made any difference. Like all of us, she has good days and bad days. I’
m trying to get past the resentment and feel compassion. When you have family history, there are old patterns there."

176269065,"Thank you for your insight. I am right there with you - I am not sure how I feel about the involuntary hold but he was getting so scary and talking about suicide and he was just running around the house screaming. He’s now home and saying he doesn’t think it was “fault” - he’s just trying to get over being locked in there without being able to leave but he does know that he can always trust me. We start with his new doctor next week and I am hopeful - he doesn’t like or want to be on the medicine but has agreed. Sometimes he says he accepts the diagnose of sz other times he says he’s fine and its all of us who just don’t see how we’re all being “messed” with and being “used” etc. It’s a very long road and I know it will take time that will be long and painful but he’s the love of my life and my best friend and when he’s clear and calm it’s so good. I just hope he can get to the point, with treatment, where he doesn’t think everyone is out to destroy and harm him

I have book club, and a ladies travel club, and other things - I mostly just feel guilt when I leave him to do these things b/c he’s home alone and so very isolated but, as you said, I have to do what I need to do to take care of myself so I can then care for him."

I was not able to get his car out of impound without a POA. I attempted to get his authorization by a handwritten release and I had two medical staff witness. It was not accepted by the Police.

176269072,"Hello thesunwillcome. I understand the emotional roller coaster of having a partner who is ill, and the deep sadness and loss when we are unable to achieve many of the fundamental expectations for ourselves and our relationships that other folks in the ‘normal’ world require of their life partnerships. For us, sadly, it is just different when we chose to continue keeping our loved ones in our lives, to whatever extent. We as partners had to learn to fully change our expectations, how we give to our loved ones, and what we think we actually need in return when existing in the shadow of their ever-present and lurking illness. Honestly, contrary to your post, it sounds to me that you are seeing things fairly clearly, and it’s not a crime to hope for recovery of those we care about. The positive perspective that you’re harboring is very much in line with what gives many caregivers and family members the strength to sustain and carry through day to day. It’s a gift and it speaks volumes to who 
you are as a person. Don’t let go of that. However, one of the things that many of us here need to hear many times over and over and to be reminded of often is to do what we need to do to take care of ourselves, our safety and wellbeing, and our own mental health first. We are of no help to our loved ones if we neglect our own basic needs. That being said, I’m a big advocate of children coming first. As you are an expecting mother, priorities I would expect should shift. You may want to consider what kind of life you want for your own child. Their safety and health should be your first priority. This is a horrific disease that effects everybody close to our ill loved ones and not often in any kind of a good long-term way. Put your baby and yourself above everybody and everything right now. Hopefully by the time your child is born, you will have a good clear head and conscience about how involved you want your ill loved one to be in your child’s life, if at all. Either way it’s ok. We talk a lot about 
setting boundaries here. It’s ok if you rule that there will be no contact unless he is on medication for example. Many people who are successfully in recovery post here with some of the most valuable insight we receive. Most seem to feel there is no hope for any level of recovery without proper meds coupled with some level of talk therapy. So, when you think about ‘recovery’, be careful not to dilute yourself. Have realistic expectations. My heart goes out to you. You are certainly never alone! Be good to yourself and to your child first and foremost and never ever feel guilty for that. Best of wishes."

176269085,"I was for over a year or even longer on olanzapine. All I did was lay on the couch, eat two meals per day and just drink three cups of tea per day. I thought I would never get out off this. And most of my overweight came from olanzapine. When I was in the hospital I wouldn’t just eat the regular meals served. My family always brought me something to drink and eat. I was just two or three weeks in hospital but have gone from 82 Kg to 96Kg. I couldn’t stop overeating till I got at home leaving the hospital. Then like said beforehand I was eating few but just laying on the couch burnt out of energy from everything. So in the end I weight 117 Kg. I couldn’t do anything. Then my psychologist changed my meds to abilify. That’s what my mother is still taking, in the beginning I was more active but became addicted to online shopping and later on relapsed on this med. I tried other meds like amilsulpride but relapsed on that. Then I got on xeplion and risperidone and since a few months quietiapine a
nd didn’t had an relapse since 2017 but I’m tired all day long and feel like every move is too much. If it wouldn’t be for smoking I would just get up for toilette something to drink like water every couple hours and couple fast meals per day. With the exception of appointments. I have one medication left to try, clozapine, but the side effects are too dangerous for me. And it isn’t a med that helps with my diabetes, my fat liver or laying lesser in bed. I can not take it right now. The blood draw wouldn’t work with me. I wouldn’t care after the 18 weeks in hospital that I would need to stay to try clozapine, to get my blood drawn monthly, but my psycholgist and legal guardian would care of that. I think clozapine would f*ck me up badly. I tried six meds and only can be on three, but I have to be on those three all at once. I’m scared of negative side effects of clozapine and a relapse that would really screw me over."
176269086,"Thank you so much for your reply, hope… I really appreciate it. You and wisdom have both made me feel very welcome here. You raise a good point about hormone therapy; my wife told me that her OB/GYN has mentioned it to her, but her OB/GYN seems to take a very hands-off approach so unless my wife pursues it further I think it’s unlikely to happen. One thing that has been tricky about working with my wife on her health issues in general (both her mental health and other issues) is that she has not granted me access to her medical records. I discovered this about a dozen years ago when she experienced a severe psychotic episode that led to her being put on a 72-hour involuntary hold and then being hospitalized twice in a three-week period. This was the first time anything this severe had occurred since we’d met, and I was shocked to find that I could not even ask basic questions of the doctors in the psychiatric unit where she was hospitalized because she hadn’t granted me access. That has sti
ll not changed to this day; however, we are planning to work with a lawyer to set up a trust/living will/etc soon, and I’m hoping to leverage that opportunity to have a _NAME_ discussion about access to medical information. Regarding putting distance between us and loved ones and friends, I like your “knocking stuff off our plate” term. I’m often doing this to help my wife manage stress. One of the unexpected upsides of the pandemic is there are far fewer social engagements that we have to say no to, and for those that do come up (e.g., socially distanced birthday cake on a patio) we can chalk up not attending to COVID concerns, not my wife’s mental health. Again, thank you so much for your suggestions and for making me feel welcome."

176269089,"_AT_MENTION_, welcome. You’re going through a tough time at the moment, and this is the right place to express your feelings of concern for your son. Obviously it would be nice to discuss this with his doctor and see if his meds need adjusting, but because of privacy concerns and the fact that he doesn’t realize he’s ill, make this difficult. I think trying to keep his environment calm and not reacting to when he acts strangely, is the right approach, if that is any consolation. If you like to watch TV together, then comedy is always a good bet. When there is not a lot you can do because options are limited, try to focus on what you do have some control over, which is making sure he gets a healthy supper, and things like that. Good luck to you, and be sure and drop in again and give an update as to how you are coping."

176269098,"Hello _PERSON_, Had no clue that my son would have a serious mental illness. He’s 24 years old and was diagnosed with SZA at 20 years old. Problems started about a year and a half earlier. As a child-sweetest, kindest boy you’d ever meet. Average grades, had a few close friends. Easy going - rarely a problem. A few months after high school, moved in an apt with friend and everything went downhill. Apparently smoked lots of pot. 5 months later, was evicted from apt - came home and the paranoia started. Pot does not agree with him, although he still uses when he can get it. Son was pretty reserved, socially awkward in high school, but had no idea of a serious mental illness. He’s been on meds for 4 years. Still heard voices till recently. He has problems holding a job, organization-messy room with dirty dishes etc, memory, handling finances - spends every penny he has. I wish things were better for him, but I know they could also be worse. I try to be thankful for everything that we have. I kno
w he would love to have a “normal” life. He’s still a kind person - willing to help anyone in need. It’s difficult to communicate with him - speaks in few words. My biggest frustration is trying to get him to cooperate for his benefit. I’d like to apply for disability so he could have a steady income - albeit less than $1k but he would have to commit to work only part time so he would not disqualify himself. He refuses to do this and keeps trying to work full time. The most he’s worked at the same job in the past 2 years is about 7 weeks. Most jobs lasted less than a month - many about a week. Don’t know how to get thru to him that this would be to his benefit. Also concerned with health insurance. He will “age out” from Dad’s insurance in about 18 months. I’m hoping something will happen between now and then to solve the insurance problem. Wishing you, your son and family the best. Take care."

Although I hear people saying I should count my blessings. More than likely the relationship will be riddled with problems, and may cause more stress and harm than good, and I don’t want him to slip backwards, he’s been doing well with small conversations, getting out of the apt alittle, looking for work, keeping his place fairly tidy, and just started doing his own laundry. But I just wonder how he’d be with a girl, it’s a mom thing. I fantasize about him meeting a nice, caring young girl who “gets” him and accepts him, and cares for him."

176269103,Good morning again lol
176269104,This is true I need help. I have no choice. In sorry bro. I’m sorry for saying that. I need help of some sort thanks all
176269105,I know. I don’t understand why.
176269106,"Two words. _PERSON_ Pine. It’s only been a few months on it (along with many other Rx’s) but we’ve seen tremendous improvements in attitude, awareness, and compliance. Keep up regular lab work to avoid negatives. It’s a generic. The big pharma companies push all the new drugs (higher margins). The pharma companies cloak their guidance in safety but I don’t believe them. And none of them are as effective on SZ in numerous studies. Can’t believe it takes so much education and pushing to get to this proven line of therapy. Our many doctors tried all the latest pharma drugs ($$) before I pushed them to use the tried and true. Hope your child can tolerate it - which labs will confirm."

176269108,"But as you say there is overlap. Before the term schizophrenia was coined, SZ was called dementia praecox which means premature or precocious dementia. Many of the same medications are used for symptoms. My father takes the same AP medication as I’m prescribed and at the same dosage. He was taking more than me, but they lowered the dosage out of concern for movement and Parkinsonism-like side effects."
176269109,"Caring mom, I just can’t believe how much your son sounds like mine. My son is just like yours, with medications not working, he has been in and out of the hospital, because of the same reasons as your son. Haldol was the only medication I saw improvement. Is ok to give them what they want to eat, is a lot better then not eating at all. When my son was ill he was scarily thin, he won’t eat or sleep during his phychosis. But now he is being picky but I give him what he wants to eat. He looks better. Arrr we need lots of patience and love for them. That’s why we are here, I am just so thankful I found this group or I would be crying everyday. But this group have given me strength knowing I can relate to others and I am not alone. Thank you for your response."

176269119,"I feel obliged to give a further update here, just to keep things clear. I finally got a chance to read through all of the paperwork my son was given on his discharge, and it clearly states that the discharge diagnosis was Major Depressive Disorder AND Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and other Psychiatric Disorder. I do not understand why the social worker only mentioned the MDD. The second diagnosis is of course quite vague, but at least it is noted. So far I am learning what I already knew. The medical system is only a tool. It is not THE solution. It is just part of an ongoing process and requires continual vigilance. Yesterday we went to the ER to have his wound checked. My son was being most uncooperative and did not want me to accompany him. I was trying to let the staff know his situation, but all I got was the HIPPA brick wall treatment. We left the ER room after he had been given an antibiotic and a prescription for more (his wound is infected). He was already on very strong antibiotics
. Fortunately, I called the advice nurse and drilled to the bottom of that one. She had his consent to release form on file from our very first ER visit and freely talked to me about the situation. The doctor then said just stay on the same antibiotics he was already on. Just a small example of what I am talking about."

We have considered this, although land is super expensive and remote… his one joy in life is shopping for himself each week, and he is a pedestrian. I am wondering if there might be a way to help my son understand that moving bricks and rocks is getting him kicked out of trailer parks. We had some reprieve when an officer talked with him about not wanting to lose his liberties. Any thoughts on this aspect of our challenge? Thanks!"
176269124,"My oldest child was in an abusive relationship like this. Their partner would threaten suicide all the time over very minor things. Like if they went with me to the grocery store and didnt bring their phone, or if they tried to get a job. It was really unhealthy, and they were much happier once their partner was out of their life. What we did was drive them to the hospital and drop them off, explaining the situation to the doctor and that they had threatened suicide if my kid broke up with them. And then we said if they ever showed up at our house again we would call the cops."
176269125,"I am overwhelmed also but I went to get outside help! Do not delay or enable the situation to continue! Your inaction is an action! You absolutely can not do this anymore by yourself (both your brother and mother). He is sick and needs professional medical intervention, legal intervention, and governmental resources. Believe it or not, by getting him the help that he does not think he needs is the best gift you can give him and your family! People affected with the disease schizophrenia lack the insight into their own disease. Hence, the inability to understand that they are sick. GO GET HELP ASAP!"

She missed the time she had when she was a child and it took us a long time to accept that it is going to be different. It has been 12 years now since she was diagnosed for her to work out a medication regime that minimizes the side effects, lots of trial and errors there and hopefully it won’t be as hard in the future. There were times when nothing seemed to work. When I looked back to understand what has worked for my daughter and kept that up, the rest became easier. My best wishes for you and your son."

176269143,"Hi wkarm, As her guardian/substitute decision maker, it seems you already gave agreement for the invega sustenna or paliperidone — but you felt bad when your mother called you in a panic about it. Did she get a shot? Did you go with paliperidone? It’s a rock and a hard place — she can be miserable at the thought of being medicated, or miserable without medication … not pleasant, either way. Schizophrenia is characterized by delusions/hallucinations, but paranoia can come and go. Your mother originally left her house with feelings of danger when the paranoia hit hard … and now she is fearful about the medication. As someone mentioned, whatever damage the medication does, there’s cognitive damages to being unmedicated. Lacking insight means she cannot appreciate the latter. At 87 years of age, her quality of life is not going to change drastically. It’s not about diminishing the hallucinations and accompanying delusions at this point — it’s more about reassuring her so she isn’t f
earful and stressed. That could possibly be accomplished with companionship, or she may need a sedative when things get tough for her. At this point, as long as your mother can reach a state of equalibrium whereby she isn’t in a state of panic from the paranoia, that is the best outcome. At 87 years of age, I wouldn’t worry about the state of her brain, so much as the state of her feeling secure — whether that is achieved with more company, sedatives, or anti-psychotics, is up to you. You could consider hiring a personal care worker to sit with her through meal times, that might be all the extra she needs. Good nutrition and some attention, does wonders. Good luck! Let us know how you get on."

176269148,"My son is 23, and started to have paranoid thoughts and to hear things 3 years ago. At that moment my wife and I were devastated and started searching for all possible alternatives and treatments. We came across studies showing the relationship between Schizophrenia and Vitamin D. Coincidentally we were familiar with a treatment called Coimbra Protocol specialized in treating auto-imune diseases with very high doses of vitamin D (we have a relative that has been extremely successful in treating her Multiple Sclerosis with this protocol for the last 20 years). As our reading pointed out to the auto-immune aspect of schizophrenia we made the risky decision to try this protocol on our son instead of using conventional anti-psychosis medicine. To make a long story short, he has been on this treatment for the last 3 years without presenting positive (psychosis) symptoms although the negative (cognitive) symptoms remained the same. His vitamin D was extremely low and inflammation serum indicators high wh
en he started the treatment and they are all normal now. I don’t know what the future holds and if this treatment will produce results for the rest of his life, and we are very curious to hear about any other people who chose this alternative and could share the experience. Thank You."

I have backed way off and have let my husband handle things, which seems to have worked reasonably well. But his usual absent mindedness about taking his medication appears to have continued for several days in a row now, and I’ve been trying to figure out ways to bring it up that balance his need for autonomy with my need for a stable and caring husband.

I suggest that you instead post to the Diagnosed forum over here: Schizophrenia.com Schizophrenia.com Schizophrenia Discussion Community for People Diagnosed, or who think they may have Psychosis. Marijuana / cannabis is a known factor in increasing risk of psychosis / schizophrenia - here is a recent summary of the research: Psychiatric Times Does Cannabis Cause Psychosis?

But psychosis takes away a person’s ability to reason things out, as they can’t see the world (or themselves) as things really are. Discipline, especially hard discipline, does not defeat anosognosia at all. It just breeds resentment in my opinion."
176269161,My dad drove drunk all the time when I was a kid! He got 6 dui total I spent a lot of nights waiting for him to come home. He’s gotten in accidents before and if he ever killed anyone in a drunk driving accident we would have lost our house! I would feel completely powerless while I waited for him to come home! He’s retired and only drives kind of buzzed coming home from the Christmas party at his law firm every year. I’ve heard cops drive him home the doorbell rang and cops would bring him home wasted . That was nice of them. Drunk driving is serious I absolutely never ever drive drunk. I hate drunk drivers and I wish I would have called the cops on him. I had extreme anxiety as a kid from staying up all night with no control .
176269162,"I certainly appreciate the sad side of this and the grief we have is real and warranted, but I also see the positive (at least in theory) that your son would like to have a family some day. I take that to mean that he welcomes the idea of meaningful relationships. He obviously trusts and appreciates you! When it seems our loved ones are isolating, we can fall back on the things that might help. Are you able to visit your son? At a non stressful time for him, might you have a conversation to let him know it is important to you to stay in touch, but you’d like to know what he prefers. Is a phone call or text better? How often? Would he be willing to plan a regular time to talk (just because it makes you happy when you talk)? Another thought…Is he still taking medication? As you make observations about what appears to be greater isolation, is this something you would share with his doctor? My son is often not very responsive to texts, or at least not as quickly as I would like. But sometimes I thi
nk that he is comfortable in his own way with that balance and occupies his time in other ways that are OK with him at least for the time being. He also once told me that he’d like to have a family someday. And another time he told me about two friends who he thinks so much of that he’d “like them to be groomsmen at his wedding someday.” Honestly, thinking about marriage for him is a scary thought, but if that can happen, I can hope for the best and for his happiness in it!"

It’s easy for me to decide what he needs to do, but I am not living his day-to-day life. We have suggested that our nephew come out for a visit, but so far he hasn’t agreed to it. I suspect that she would be very much against it, which is why he hasn’t agreed to it. But we will keep trying.

176269169,"You don’t need to hide your daughter’s situation, not here or anywhere else. But people here understand. We also understand that you have the condition as well, but that your daughter’s schizophrenia is more pronounced. There is a known family connection with schizophrenia. If we remove the _USER_ID_ associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and talked more openly, doctors could counsel people on the family history and help people more. There’s no shame in it. My mother has auditory hallucinations as well. When she is on her meds, the hallucinations are subdued and happen very rarely. When she is off her medication, like now, she hears voices daily. A lot of the time she is having conversations with her family members. They are in Austria, but she thinks they must be here. If I try and talk to her, she will say “shh…I’m listening”, or if I call her, my mother will say “I’m busy right now, I will call you later”. Sometimes she sees things. None of that is a problem, except 
for when she bases her decisions on what the ‘voices’ tell her. Or when she becomes paranoid, and afraid that someone is trying to harm her. It upsets me when she is scared. I just try to reassure her the best that I can — as I know that she is not really in danger, but for her it feels very real. I’ve learned that when she is delusional, not to confront her about it. I don’t play along, but rather when my mother says something out of the ordinary, I will just say “okay” and then steer the conversation back to something real. My mother is mostly a lovely person, but sometimes she can get angry. If she is feeling paranoid and begins to accuse me of things, or she says something mean to me, I give her a time out and saying that I’m leaving and I will talk to her later. When we get together again, we are back on good terms. I tell my mother that I love her, as often as I can, so she always knows that even when things get difficult. I hope that the doctor is able to help you on Tuesday. Good luck

176269175,"The book “I’m not Sick, I don’t Need Help” has a method for talking to someone who is mentally ill and psychotic. The first step is “listen”. The second step is “empathize”, the third is “agree” and the 4th is “partner”. I personally use those steps with people mentally ill or not in order to gain agreement with something I want or need. It’s a trick to listen to people when they are talking nonsense, but honestly, almost everyone just wants someone to listen to them. It won’t hurt anything if your dad talks nonsense to you. Probably just knowing that you WANT to be next to him, ask questions and be interested in his answers will help a lot. You can listen to him, empathize with whatever he says, agree with something (anything) even if you don’t agree with most, and then partner with him to stay in touch somehow. Even a “how do you feel about cell phones?”, is there a way to use them that won’t bother you?, agree to talk once a week or once a month or something, 
and “so glad we are getting to know each other”, is a way to apply LEAP. You can learn about LEAP in Dr. _PERSON_’s book, but adjust and bend the method to suit how you feel comfortable using it, and the specific situation you find yourself in with your dad when you meet. Good luck, and yes, I agree it is best to try and forge some type of a relationship as at 60 you just never know if you will meet again."

sad, discouraged and depleted in the long term and as for bringing potential children into the mix (if that is a consideration) you would literally be a single parent parenting a child and an adult and worrying about the safety of the child if and when you were not always present. In addition to that there are studies that suggest that some mental illness has a hereditary component so there is that to think about. Please try to look at your situation not just through the lens of an irrational heart but in this case with just your rational mind, because it will serve you well to do so. Don’t bank on a relationship based on unreliable potential, that is a house of cards that is guaranteed to crumble. Best wishes."

I was on birth control before that and periods were light and short. Which was always nice. Often our periods will get longer and more frequent before they start spacing out for your change.

176269207,"A group home saved our son’s life. Understandably, there are not many housing options. Ours was private pay so it cost a lot of money. I know not everyone can do that. We had been advised not to let our son come home because he was not med-compliant and we knew he would not get better in our home, so this was his option, to go to a homeless shelter or the group home. He chose the latter. There, he had to sign an agreement that he would be med-compliant. He was coherent for a couple days, but his condition worsened, and the group home stood by him. They were SO patient with his condition of Formal Thought Disorder. Because everyone else was taking meds, it was just the normal thing to do. The doctor changed his A/P to Clozapine, and eventually he started to get better. He has been med-compliant and hospital free for 2+ years, is living in his own apartment, working part-time, and is doing great, all considering."

176269212,I would like an answer to this question as well. I’m curious as to how much is sz and how much is meds. I don’t have an answer myself because I’ve been on meds since my negative symptoms have been noticeable to me.
176269213,"Oh the ups and downs of cannabis. My sz son prob brought on his illness due to a combination of pot smoking, genetics and being a young teen. That saddens me and scares me for other kids but to be honest he has smoked the entire time pot and cigarettes. He is living independently and swears that pot helps him cope. He had been in clozapine fir 5 years and that had been a big help. He know pot and cigs only decrease the clozapine in his blood. He doesn’t care. He wants to stop being a waiter and work at a dispensary. I myself don’t smoke anything but how can I tell him to stop if he is managing on his own ? Lately he’s hit a bump in the road and may be doing stimulants. Now pot seems so not important."
176269214,"It helps by teaching you how thinking works, how the mind works, you then learn how to recognize and change your thoughts and behaviours. When you think a certain way the neuropathways in your brain change, the more you think that way the stronger those pathways become. If you’re constantly thinking in a negative way those pathways in your brain will get stronger, you’ll continue to think negatively and thus feel bad. If you can recognize the negative thoughts when they happen and change them to a positive, yet realistic thoughts, you’ll start to feel better. So for example if you’re negative thought is “My cognition is slow and I can’t think”, write it down, then beneath it write something positive like “Cognitive problems are common in schizophrenia but it’s a scientific fact that the brain can change and improve, it just takes practice and time”. At first it may be hard to think of positive things or to change your thinking, I struggled with it, but practice makes perfect.Cog
nition is just thinking, if you are not thinking right your cognition will be poor, I use to have that problem, but I practised. I read a lot about psychology, tried to learn new things, I taught myself how to program which took quite a while, I took time to think things through and wrote down my thoughts, then rewrote them until they made sense, by doing that my cognition improved, I can now articulate things without having to write them down, then think them over and rewrite them over and over again until they make sense. My thinking and cognition slowly improved. I’m now generally a happy positive thoughtful person. I use to be depressed, sometimes angry and miserable, I had trouble thinking and putting my thoughts into words, I am doing so much better now… I found this definition of negative symptoms on the Internet: ""Negative symptoms are so called because they describe thoughts or behaviour that the person used to have before they became ill but now no longer have or have to a lesser extent and so 
have been lost or taken away from their psyche. It describes normal aspects of the person’s behaviour "" Negative symptoms, your thoughts and behaviours, are a result of how your brain is wired. As you change your thoughts you change the wiring of your brain and you improve, but it is a slow process. It took me months of practice to start thinking differently and years to really have it become habitual. If you’re expecting a therapist to instantly make everything better just by hearing the therapist say something it doesn’t really work like that. It takes time and practice to form new neuropathways and change old ones in your brain and to strengthen them. Learning CBT is like anything else, some people pick it up quickly, while others have to study and practice it before they full grasp it and get a benefit out of it."

176269225,"Thanks for the update on your sister. I’m glad she got a new lawyer, chances are anything she paid to the old one will not be refunded, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. It is likely statistically that if she gets probation that there will be violations of probation in her future, which usually means jail or prison to the full amount of the law. (My husband made it 2.5 years through probation and then a traffic ticket, and revocation of probation and prison occurred.) Any violation of the law while on probation can be cause for a revocation of probation and incarceration for your sister. I know you don’t wish this for her, however, things are going to run their course. Try to stay hopeful, and keep looking for ways to make the situation better.

176269227,"Hi Jan, We were well aware of the problem that started with the fires two years ago, only becoming worse last year. The studio apartment in a 100 year old un-renovated apartment building we (well, I was paying for it all) rented was $1200 and is now $2000 a month. He only receives $800 in disability, which he usually spends in the first few days of each month. But he is fixated on the fact that he is from that town in CA, went to high school there, that it is all he knows and is where he feels comfortable. He goes to several AA meetings a day and asks people for money. He has been drinking again for a few years and so this is just opportunistic on his part; he has no interest in stopping drinking. He won’t go to therapy any more because the therapist was trying to get him to commit himself. I am not sure what will happen with him because he is too proud to try to get HUD or Section 8 housing (even though his odds are slim anyway) and eventually everyone will tire of him asking for money. I did my 
best and I supported him and bailed him out from fines and overdue bills for many years, but now it is his turn to help himself. I need to concentrate on my own life and healing the damage. If he gets help and turns his life around, then we can talk about reconciling. I am very sad but I can’t take any more."

176269233,"I have been in a relationship for 11 years with my bf who has paranoid SZ. He is also a drug addict (crack, meth, pills). I have finally had to let him go. Hes been on disability since he was 19 (he’s 41…I’m 53). He was always very sweet and affectionate until he got hooked on pain pills this year. I watched him disappear. He moved out of my house and started living as a nomad. Bouncing from his brother’s house (also an addict) to his father’s house. His father is an alcoholic who makes jokes about the situation. I’ve gotten zero support from his family. His mother moved away to another state a few years ago after suffering a mental breakdown. She lives with her parents now. I’ve been married to an alcoholic and a meth addict. I finally got sober 1 year ago. This was when things started going south. I dont need this in my life. I’ve decided to be selfish and only look out for myself. His friends are losers and drug addicts. He lies to me about everything. I wish you peace. Take care 
of yourself and your baby. It’s a hard road trying to live with someone who refuses help. My bf gets an injection of 30 mg of Abilify every 3 months. But he is taking street drugs too. He has told me he just doesn’t like being in one place too long. We used to eat ice cream in bed watching movies. Grill out. Go to movies. Now if he comes over he eats and goes to sleep. I decided I’m not ok with that. I’d rather live alone. And he doesn’t care anymore. When I tell him hes changed he just says “I’m sorry”. I’m sorry too. But I had to move on."
176269234,"Unbeknownst to me, my son has been looking for work since June. Now I know why he kept asking for the car. While I still have my reservations, I’m so very proud of him. The last time he worked, it was in 2012, before the diagnosis, and as expected, they were all disasters (6 jobs between 2011-2012). Now he seems a bit stable and I’m hoping for the best. I think working will make him feel so much better about himself. I truly do. Give him some sort of purpose, a reason to get out of bed. And I want this for him so badly. But here is the dilemma. He has gone on several interviews, and no call backs. My heart breaks for him. He said to me, “Mom, they can tell there’s something wrong with me. I don’t talk much, and I never laugh, and I don’t know if I answered their questions right”. I’m sure he would never mention sz, but I’m sure they noticed something was “off”. I’m hoping someone will give him a chance. Also, he was not sure if he should mention sz @ the initial interview. I
’m sure he was scared to mention it. I’m hoping for a kind hearted empathetic employer to come his way."

176269236,"A couple of things that caught my eye. You stated that this was the third time you tried to have him live with you and you said he’s still not ready to get help. Why did you think it would be different this time? I know when we love someone we hope for the best, but just wondering why you didn’t only agree to try if he DID get on meds? Waiting for him to be ready will probably never happen. It seems he would rather be homeless then get on meds. Also you haven’t posted in awhile, have you talked to him? Is he ok? I think you have to do what’s right for you at this point. I don’t know what it takes to get forced medication and or involuntary commitment treatment but that seems like a better option then prison. I’m surprised with the multiple hailing’s they didn’t require treatment, but each state country is different."

176269241,Thank you all for your responses! My daughter is 9 months pregnant and went off of her meds! her Drs want her on them but … I don’t know if she fully realizes her issue! She was in the military and insists that they implanted a bug in her and are watching her! Thinking that they are using her for intelligence! — she did not stay in military - made it through boot camp and some of AIT before being discharged! I have told her that the Army did not do that and that they or anyone is after her! Am hoping after she has this baby that she will get back on her meds! Not the aderall that she swears by! To me - aderall causes more issues to the already established issue! Praying fervently for her!

176269245,"_AT_MENTION_, I’m so glad your son has turned around. Your story sounded so hopeless like mine and many others’ stories on here, but when you hit rock bottom there is no place to go but up. I wish my son would try to work, I think it could kill many birds with one stone: him possibly making some friends, get him out of the house for a few hours a day, and best but not least, he could earn some income. Just so many reasons I wish he would try, even if starting out at like 10 hours a week somewhere. Funny thing is I own my own cleaning company, he could easily work for me, and he could easily use my car to get around. I don’t really need to leave my house too often. Whenever I approach him, he comes back with, “ mom, you know what these meds do to me, you know the side affects, how can you ask me to work”? Then I feel guilty for even asking him. I’m sure a lot of it is the side effects, but sometimes I wonder if it’s just the fear of being around people, (he would be part of a cleaning 
crew), or maybe partial laziness. They get conditioned to this way of life, and have zero desire to ever work. Every mother wants something alittle better for their child, and seeing him having no life, and doing nothing with his life, it is like a slow death every day. I knew your son would do well with his brother. My son always seems happier when his older brother and girlfriend are around. They are the closest to him having “friends” and they are within his age group. It sounds like a change of environment is what your son needed, I always said a bad environment and upbringing can cause so much trauma and damage and always felt like that was a huge contributing factor in developing sz. And I bet he is following all of his older brother’s rules too. They don’t ever listen to us. _PERSON_"

176269260,"My son had no insight a year ago. He became a danger to himself because he was catatonic and was not eating or drinking. Prior to that he had been wandering in another state living out of his car for 3 months, then in and out of various hospitals for literally half of a 12-month timeframe (and a short time in a residential treatment program). He was so sick, and yet refused meds, but he was so bad off that the hospital finally gave him ECT, and for some reason he accepted that a bit reluctantly. I first used LEAP with him while he was still in the hospital. It was amazing. I told him that it mattered to me what HE thought and how HE felt. His demeanor immediately changed, and he said “Really?” He had a partial short-lived recovery, then relapsed again. A different hospital discharged him to home saying “What do you want us to do with him? He will die if he stays here.” We had to wait another week with him mostly catatonic at home until his vitals deteriorated and we called 911 (with the adv
ice of his former psychiatrist). After that hospital stay and more ECT, we had planned for him to go directly to a group home (we refused to let him come home) upon discharge. He had to be med-compliant at the group home. And he has been, his med was soon thereafter changed to Clozapine, and has been there for a year and is very stable! In many ways, we got our son back, and there is still more upside. We hope he can be independent someday. He is such a good young man and we love him so much."
176269261,"I’m restricted with conditions, truly. I like in a group home, not control over my money, no control where I live, some control I have is with alcohol and I abuses this. I need to do this."
176269262,You need a psychiatrist and probably Meds. It seems to be psychosis of some kind. Especially since you say you are starting to believe it’s real. Not all meds make you gain a lot of weight. And we still have personality It’s good that you have enough insight to question it though.
176269263,"I’m in a in the middle house (halfway house) because of homeless status. I don’t make enough for my own room, with the government benefits I receive, in the US.

176269264,Yes sure. So why not unmedicated?
176269265,"This is the issue most people with schizophrenia have, it’s called learn helplessness. They believe they are hopeless and can never recover so they never do anything to improve themselves. This negative way of thinking is what cause them to never get out of the hell they are stuck in. You need to encourage your son that there is hope for a great life. There are people out there who will be his friends. I am proof. I used to have absolutely no social life whatsoever. But the more I improved myself, the more confident I got and I realized that there are many people including pretty girls who like me. Good luck."

In one of the _PERSON_ videos he asks a roomful of mental health professionals if they have ever talked anyone out of a delusion. None of them had. The more I spoke rationally to my son about his delusions, the less he trusted me. I don’t try to tell my son that he is sick, he currently trusts me when he needs help. My conversations with him are a tricky business, I feel as though I am walking on a tightrope. When he was receiving medical treatment, he told me the people were laughing at him and he wanted to know what to do. (They weren’t) I suggested he tell them he was feeling sensitive as he was ha
ving a bit of a rough day. He was very pleased with my answer."
176269272,"Way to much IMO… If it were me, I would not push it, this is forever, long term shit… Stressing him will make it worse… relapse is certain… The voices are real, very real, as real as you read this message… never deny or argue the reality of any of it…"
176269273,My son is on it. Scattered results. Active symptoms ie voices lessened - not a lot of weight gain- but he has not taken it for 90 days straight.
176269274,"I see _AT_MENTION_ that you seems to be doing the best you can as a distance caregiver. I agree that LEAP re the toilet is probably will not be too workable if you only see your brother every few weeks for 1/2 hour. Perhaps withholding the aide is the best solution in that matter. It might be workable to try and use LEAP to get him to stay longer than 1/2 hour when you visit. It was ONLY successful for me to use LEAP if I had weeks to try and change a behavior, and I could pick up the same conversation where we left off the next time I talked to my daughter. _AT_MENTION_ I am glad to hear that your son is continuing his injections since the court order ended. I understand your panic when the time approaches, I felt it for 6 months or so and then started to relax, as she just would go when it was her appointment time. We barely talked about it, just “it’s time for your shot tomorrow”. Yes, I think the reluctance to shower and wearing the same clothing day and night is part of the illness. My d
aughter will shower when I ask her to, and tonight she actually let me go shopping with her to buy some new sweatpants and a sweatshirt. I hope they eventually come out of the bag and find their way onto her body. Her old sweatpants and sweatshirt are almost a year old now, and she wears them daily."
176269275,"That sounds like a truly excellent Idea. I myself have been researching (at work of all places) thought stopping. I'm not getting much results. Stupid Google. I need to explain to my pdoc tonight what I mean about not being able to think. Obviously I can think enough to write, assuming this makes sense, but I can't think. Like my thoughts are all blocked up and stopped. I don't know if it is some sort of bad brain fog from depression, or depersonalization or what. I have until 4 to figure it out because I need to tell him that I can't think. He's probably going to want to give me more medicine and thats making me very panicky indeed."
176269276,Where do you live in U.S.? Do you have a _USER_ID_ affiliate?
176269277,I think depressed people’s version of happiness is just something not everyone understands.
176269278,"And that you’re not on a more intense medication, like Clozapine."
176269279,"_AT_MENTION_ do you think the doctor can prescribe him something else under the guise of something else? Like another Med to sleep him sleep, or help with blood pressure or anxiety? If applicable. So sorry for what you are going through… I can’t even imagine the heartbreak of 29 years symptom free to now dealing with this."
176269280,"I went to a LEAP workshop last year and found it to be very helpful. Dr. A did a lot of role plays which helped me to better understand tge techniques. There were parents, psychiatrists, judges and attorneys there in addition to mental health therapists"
176269281,"Lots of good answers here already. I agree that it is time to find another doctor. There are lots of examples that refute his grim prediction (including my son as one of them). There are good doctors that might still not be right for your situation, but this guy sounds like a real loser. Try, try again until you find the right one. They are out there."
176269282,"We would all like to save others from the pain of making our mistakes. But think about yourself at that time. If someone had told you “I tried this and it went badly for me, you should do this instead” would you have listened? I sure as heck did have several people try. And I knew my life better than them, and they were just trying to control me, and just because they were dumb didnt mean I would be as dumb. I did not listen."
176269283,"I dont have a psychiatrist since 8 Jan, pdoc said I am too stable to need a psychiatrist and that negative symptoms have no treatment. My family dont want me to change meds as I am the best I have ever been since having sz. They said to stop trying to be the person I was before sz as I will get worse and fail. Also that I am better than a lot of szics who are constantly being hospitalized, who are in the streets or who died. I am in the process of transferring my psychiatric folder to my gp. Then I can apply for a pdoc if my gp accepts. I have a feeling that my gp wont accept as he also said negative symptoms have no treatment. I want to try Strattera or Rexulti and also upping my risperdal to 6mg."
176269284,I had spaghetti.
176269285,"I am on Olanzapine 10mg and I also lack motivation. Also, I do not like to do anything out of my daily routine, it gets me anxious. I was on 20mg before but I did not notice any change. I hope this will be better for you. this med really s*cks"
176269286,"A lot of interesting and good stuff here, I thought, but one quick question first (before I go back and take notes so I can properly respond to each and every thought provoking thing, as I don’t think my memory can do it in one fell swoop!) are you on or have you been on any prescription medications that you found to be helpful or felt were successful? Per the topic, I was a little surprised that nobody mentioned that, when treated ‘classically’ with certain antipsychotic medications, over a long duration, this can have some pretty rough side effects on other vital physiological functions that may contribute to earlier death rates. But all in all there seem to be many success stories that live long and overall healthy lives (as healthy as any of the rest of us anyways!)"
176269287,"For going through pure Hell for 8-9 years (Diagnosed in 2013, probably had it in 2012), and overcoming one of the worst diseases unimaginable, I’d say not a nuclear code; it is a possible way to freedom from the illness in regards to Serotonin receptors misfiring, Dopamine, NMDA, and GABA as well. Hope this helps! Good luck to you all!"
176269288,"Have you asked him what his voices say to him ? Maybe once you get to know the voices also, you can mirror what they say and how they give him the comfort he needs to hear. (just a thought ) Maybe have him pick out a lego set or a art set reward for taking his meds ?"
176269289,Can you just go to your psychiatrist or do you have to go inpatient?
176269290,I feel a massive philosophical thought cloud floating towards me. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it. But this might be Spiritual Awakening 2.0 in comparison to all of the others.
176269291,I just ate breakfast then took the dog for a walk/jog. Glad you are feeling better.
176269292,"_AT_MENTION_ Is there any way to get your son to take baths instead of showers? That’s what my son does. I’ve read somewhere on the board that that the water soothes them. Might be able to explain that you just can’t afford a 2-hour shower bill, but can afford the bath."
176269293,"Anger = the predominant feeling I have, and have had since I was 11. Some day I’m going to look back with great regret on how much energy I spent being mad/hating someone/thing in my life. I know it, I recognize it, and still can’t move past it. Frustrating, but I don’t know how to change it. I’m in therapy for my anger, and progress is shaky."
176269294,"Hey, I’m treatment resistant paranoid type. I’ve been diagnosed for five years and am 24 y/o male. I have tried clozaril, and Ill give you a run down of what ive tried and my personal tips for best results. Invega Injection: Great medication for fast results to clear confusion and agitation, however for me was ineffective at relieving psychotic paranoid ideation of others (thinking they were plotting to cause me physical harm/kill me). Was on it for up to six months at a time. At doses above 100mg per 4 weeks it made me feel like a total zombie. Not sleepy, just a zombie. Perhaps at 50mg it would’ve been a good med, i cant say for sure. Zyprexa: made me really sleepy, at first it seemed to help but I never took it long enough or by doctors orders. It is know to work very quickly (a few days to a week or so) in people who it will work for. ie, if its the med for you, you’ll know within two weeks if its the one. worth trying if you haven’t. Recommend starting at 5mg not 10mg, and get to 10 
mg over a course of 3-5 days of 5mg initially. Again ,I never took it regular or as prescribed, because im stupid and stuff, but it has been said to be a total game changer for some patients. It is rated as the second most effective AP, just under clozaril. Abilify: took 3 months to work, but it made me feel like a completely normal person. But again, took 3 months to see any benefit. Loxapine: Terrible medication that made me so sedated, as with people who look for codes or rhyme messages in language, sedation makes these symptoms worse and can cause things to become dangerous quick. I do not recommend loxapine for anyone who can’t tolerate the sedation of meds as it is more sedating than zyprexa and not as efficacious. Rexulti: It’s made by the people who made abilify. If abilify didn’t work for you, rexulti might. If Abilify worked for you, rexulti probaby wont work as well. (similar pharmocology, but simply each drug leans on one side more than the other, especially in regards to partial agonism on 
D2 receptors). Seroquel: For me starting at a low dose and very slowly working my way up to 300mg (from 150mg starting), it made me feel more calm than I’ve ever felt. Less sedating than zyprexa. However I later when reaching 450mg, began to have delerium like side effects and now even 50mg puts me in a bad state. Not sure why it did that, because at first it really did help, especially with feeling calm, total anxiety killer. But sedating. (keep in mind, delerium side effects are very unusual and often a result of complex drug use, same goes for other -pine class APs). Clozaril/Clozapine: I never got to enjoy this drug by itself, my idiot fraud of a pdoc (ex-pdoc) forced me to take invega 150mg injection with it due to prior non compliance. The combination of these two drugs together resulted in seizures with catatonic phases and hallucinations similar to those experienced with sleep paralysis. It would last 4-8 hours at a time. HOWEVER, Clozaril on it’s own i no doubt believe would have been perfect at 
350mg daily, 300 night, 50mg day, it made me feel totally happy and I was able to do activities again like read, and look for work. It on it’s own (which is the only way it should be prescribed, not referencing, look up the studies yourself for proof) is a literal miracle drug. It is the gold standard. I highly recommend it. Lastly, I read a very recent article of a single case study of a treatment resistant paranoid type to be effectively treated with 24mg abilify and 2mg klonopin daily when clozaril was ineffective. He had what was called “dopamine supersensitivity psychosis”, which is basically (more less) when your brain rejects most APs and instead floods your brain with dopamine. I was only able to find one study on it. Nearly all GPs and almost all psychiatrists have no idea what the term dopamine supersensitivity psychosis even is, and often based on its misleading name, make totally improper conclusions of what it means biochemically. That’s all I got. Except to mention that drug and alcohol 
use, wether it’s OTC, beer, or meth, all these can lead to worsening of symptoms/permanent psychosis. So if you have any addiction (any) at all, then the best way to help yourself is to quit rec. drug usage (if that applies to you, just adding this last paragraph just in case). Hope some of this helps. But IMO, you should just go for the clozaril. Give it an honest two-three month try. Best wishes."

176269307,Ironically there is a NFL Quarterback among my ancestors who was a backup quarterback for a better known one. (He would be a answer to an obscure trivia question but I would give my family name away if I mentioned it.) He was before the age of mass media and I am sure that if he had the disease like others on that side of the family you probably still would have never heard of him. The thing is that it’s likely such a man would have been sidelined by the disease in college due to the insomnia issues that can affect athletic performance and the overall task impairment that would affect his ability to be a quarterback. So that probably why it never happened.

176269318,"Hi _AT_MENTION_, yes you are right, I have backed off on intervening financially. Last night my nephew came home with liquor on his breath. I asked if he’d been drinking, and he immediately denied. I brought it up again later, he denied again. He’s not stupid, he knows he can push the line. He’ll probably do the same with meth. My other line of reason with him is the health outcomes of tweakers. Possibly his drinking last night was to counter his cravings, which he mentioned earlier in the day, his hands shaking so much he dropped his phone several times. I have no idea what his inner experience is like, other than what he’s told me. As a young neurotic, feeling persecuted by schoolmates and family, I felt out of control and that feeling stayed with me into adulthood, leading to my drinking heavily -until I got help. For a schizophrenic, can those feelings be reduced via therapy and pharmaceuticals? My impression from _USER_ID_ meetings is it’s a lifelong battle. I want to see him have a 
life of some reasonable type. His preferred form of medication is a judicious balance of alcohol and meth, which led to him being kicked out of his parents house and living on the street, after getting a DUI for same."

176269329,"This could be an interesting thread on its own, how being a caregiver has changed your life in unexpected ways. I, too, used to love listening to music. In fact, I played music semi-professionally for many years. But after being around my husband, who mostly prefers 70s rock or pop music, I found I was no longer interested in listening to the music I enjoyed.

176269343,"My 32 year son with sz lives my wife and I. He is doing pretty good but there are times that he requires so much direction and things to do. He hangs around in the kitchen waiting for us to give him something to do. My wife gives with chores in the kitchen and I have him working around the yard and in addition we ride bikes and play tennis. However, that is still not enough…lol. What can we do to give him something to occupy his time? He waits to watch movies with me at night which is the only time I see him relaxed. He is so lost without some direction or guidance. Is this normal for sz? He will not go out for any purpose unless it is with me shopping or going to work (part time) - which is really promising. Also, he really seems to have issues with remembering things. His short term and long term memory seems really poor. He has no real awareness of things around him at times. Is this common? I know that sz has many faces and this might be one them. Overall, he seems to be doing not bad but I a
m 62 and my wife is 58 and we can only keep him busy for so long. The Doctor has prescribed 20 mg propranoloL to help him with his agitation (he is always bouncing his legs). That does not seem to help much. Any ideas? Thanks"

These things seem cyclical with him. It is not the first relationship he has destroyed in this manner ether. It’s like as if some sorts of narrative/script that plays out in his head. Same craziness, same delusions… I hope he is finally starting to realize the patterns. Though getting on medication is still in question. I want to stand by and fight for him, to get him on meds, and yet again I am afraid of what that might mean for me and my baby in the long run. These are some very hard decisions, I can absolutely relate to your pain and the sadness is quite deep. I keep telling my self to be patient, to ride this out. Hopefully time will put them in that “rock bottom” as you mentioned where they give up and finally accept help. All best wishes to you Feelingalone, BIG mental hug."

176269355,At least in the US this flies in the face of practical limitations of the legalities of forced commitment. They simply can’t ‘swoop in and save her’ without endangering herself and others.
176269356,"Today I am feeling wistful and sad because my son is in the hospital again, his third involuntary commitment. My son has paranoid schizophrenia, has always been an easy going, cooperative, good person, was a delightful child, a sweet, sensitive little boy who sparkled and was beloved by all. Never a day in his life ever had any sort of trouble with either behavioral problems, nor was he ever in trouble with the law. And now that he has this terrible serious mental illness, he is treated like a criminal for exhibiting symptoms of his illness. The deputies come for him and they handcuff him and take him away for a mental hygiene hearing. I feel so completely miserable for him."
176269357,"A couple things. First, an immediate response often is to pay these bills for your son, but this could be a bad move. Once you have paid, you lose an avenue for him to declare bankruptcy. Often people with SMI are young, without a job and with few secure assets. When they incur significant debt they become prime candidates for bankruptcy. My father repeatedly made this mistake with my brother in multiple manic periods where he would bounce checks thinking he had unlimited funds. This was back when there was still considerable ‘float’ or lag between writing a check and it being cashed. He eventually was hospitalized and his mail was being forwarded which introduced more lag and then there were bounced check fees etc, so my father was continually depositing money in his account and things kept bouncing. My brother was incoherent while in the hospital and had only vague recollection of what he bought. Considering it was a private mental hospital he stayed in, I‘m sure it cost a fortune. This hap
pened more than once, but after a while he stabilized. Later while I was out of my prodrome and semi-florid with SZA, I found out that my brother who was either under or unemployed at the time was in serious credit card debt (we were both living with our parents then). He was hiding it, and I was looking for something and semi-snooping and discovered it. I told my father and eventually they got him to a lawyer and he declared bankruptcy and it went very well. The burden of his debt was causing him anxiety, my father was giving him money, but couldn’t understand where it was all going. Bankruptcy laws are a bit different now, but generally it’s a bad idea to pay off collection agencies outright, as they can tack on fees and often old debts have already been written off for cents on the dollar by the time they get them, so it’s free money minus the expense of harassing phone calls and scary letters. Talk to a lawyer before you go to any debt consolidation agencies as well. You son’s instincts are correc
t, a lot of these things are scams that prey off ignorance. Good luck."
176269358,hopefully the anxiety gets better for you. I get anxious regularly too but i don’t go out alone anymore and then it’s better.
176269359,"What is it that I want to hear? Are you a mind reader? I’ve already decided to not be partners with this woman, and that I’ll still try to be friends with her, if she wants that, to be supportive. Read up dude. I said as much in my second post. I don’t understand why you’re coming here with all of this negativity."
176269360,"Hello _PERSON_. I’m so glad to hear you have your son with you now. Our sons sound so similar. We too had to pull him away from his life (at college) and bring him home. It’s been 3 years, with most of that time on monthly med injections. At this point, our son’s negative symptoms impact his functioning even more than his positive symptoms. He has no life outside of our house. From what I understand, this illness often causes frontal lobe damage and this damage impairs self-awareness. I think you just have to give it time, to see if your son’s brain can heal a bit. Hopefully your son will have a better outcome than our son has. Try to provide the calmest and the most stress-free environment as possible. Give him his space, allowing him to reach out to you, rather than you reaching out to him. His life is completely altered, and it’s possibly going to take a few years to see exactly how this illness progresses for your son. It’s taken us awhile to fully understand that our son’s brain 
works very differently now, and his thought processes are messed up. We just have to let things go in one ear and out the other."

176269370,"Hi Vvicin01, just wanted to send you my warmest wishes. Accepting the change our adult children go thru as a result of SZ is really a process. No one prepares us for it! It’s a journey of confusion, uncertainity and overwhelm. And very few people can really understand what we go thru. It’s really a family illness as it affects the entire family. I’m grateful we have this site and _USER_ID_ where we can get the support we need to meet this challenge. We love our children and only want what’s best for them… which makes it so hard for us. It definitely takes time for us to adjust to the reality of mental illness and I think we’ve all done our share of grieving to get there. Today I am grateful for things other parents take for granted in their adult children. And although there are days that I still find myself in overwhelm and grief around the illness, I just keep showing up and continue to advocate for my son’s treatment, his housing and his overall well-being. And I focus on staying s
trong…spiritually, emotionally, mentally and physically. That’s my gift to myself and my son. God bless!"
176269371,"Offer to hire a maid to clean every two weeks or so. I’m _PERSON_ and I did that for myself and it changed my organization and social status for the better. My parents also hired her for themselves and my brother with bipolar disorder. It gets boots on the ground in his space and gives him some social contact and a clean apartment without Mom-ing him. A likely reason he’s turned night into day is to reduce and control how much stimulation he gets and social contact which is also stressful. I did this when I was in college. To get him out you will need some incentive or reward for going out, and some assurance the environment is safe and controlled."
176269372,Not for me. I’ve tried it in past but it didn’t work out. I did go med free from 2007-2012 but after that I needed meds and if I didn’t take them I’d get severe depression and also psychosis symptoms

176269375,"I don’t really have an immediate need for LEAP, as I’m not directly involved with my brother’s care and I’m not a mental health “professional” in the usual sense. I might need it in the future and I’m interested on a personal and networking level, however. I signed up on the list to be notified for training a while back, but so far it seems training events are few and far between and they never seem to be near my area. Has anyone had the training? How does it compare to the book? Intuitively it makes perfect sense to me, given my personal experience how people with SZ related diseases think and feel. I’m concerned I might not have the same experience if I read the book without training. I have similar questions about CBT. I’ve been practicing my own version of it for decades I suppose, but I’m curious how it’s ‘really’ done."
176269376,Please eat and take your meds. Worried about you
176269377,"Yes, they’re very similar alright. Except according to phase 3 trials, placebo is better!"
176269378,"yea, I don’t feel compelled to pick anymore. It’s gone. I pick a little because it itches because it’s healing but I’m not compelled to do it. I can stop when I notice I’m doing it. Before I would be screaming inside my head to stop and I had to do it. I would keep going no matter how bad it hurt. My fingertips were always caked with blood. I’m so thrilled. In the past I’ve always grown out of my obsessions and compulsions sooner or later but this has been going on so long and torturing me so long I thought it would never end. I’m so, so, so happy. I can’t wait to see my pnurse and tell her. She’s going to be really happy for me."

AND I had to just have faith in a higher power that SOMEHOW things would come together to create a change for the better (police, arrest, jail, a judge who understood mental illness, my daughter acting crazy at the right time (as sometimes she didn’t appear crazy at all), and me having the courage to ask for court ordered help). I couldn’t have planned the miracle that broke her psychosis, BUT I kept trying and waiting until it happened: when all the little pieces fitted together 
into a solution. Modi, you HAVE to take care of yourself, mental illness is soul damaging for everyone (caregiver and afflicted). I trusted that somehow the right situation would occur and I would take the right action. I believe that can happen for you too."

It cuts both ways, since it gives a legal process for eviction and protects both the tenant and the landlord.

176269397,"Hi spouse_ca, welcome to the forum! I consulted my friend about your question, she taught Family to Family for several years. She wondered if your wife’s gynecologist had considered prescribing hormone therapy to help keep your wife’s hormone levels balanced during this time of change? Hormone therapy is considered to be quite controversial to some people, while others simply need the relief hormone therapy can provide. Sadly, the world of perimenopause is like this regarding an amazing number of women’s health concerns. Woman can have many different symptoms from their hormones changing. For classic examples, some women can get quite (!) moody, others can actually suffer from some speech issues. Little things like saying one word when you meant another or actually forgetting the names of things. One of my friends passed around several perimenopause books for all of her friends to read. She had originally thought she was suffering from dementia when she kept forgetting words. Another thought 
she was having a heart attack the first time a hot flash woke her up with what felt like “sparkles” in her chest. We do know that stress is one of the most common triggers for episodes. Hormonal changes do produce a great deal of personal stress. Hot flashes can ruin sleep and for many people hot flashes occur in the daytime as well. Many people have to learn to dress with lighter weight clothing year around to keep hot flashes at bay, for me personally, it would be best if I could pull around a large battery fan on wheels. I did try the hormone therapies, they did give me relief for several years before they started causing eye migraines. My DIL suffers from severe bipolar. Her husband is fully convinced her monthly hormonal changes play havoc with her bipolar. Even more so, after their first child was born, she suffered from delusions and was treated for postpartum depression. The delusions subsided until after the birth of their second child, ten years later. He was like “aha I knew it!” Just like 
it did before, she had more bipolar episodes in the years following the birth of her second child. While it anecdotal, her husband is a huge believer in her hormones triggering episodes. I am sorry that you are finding yourselves having to put some distance between loved ones and friends while you try to figure out the best path forward. My husband and I call it knocking stuff off our plate - its usually temporary- but not fun in the meantime. Good luck!"

Thank you for your tireless research and outreach! You sharing has been valuable for me. My understanding is as yours is, that second generation AP meds tend to have fewer or more mild side effects, which I have always (obviously) tended to advocate for. However, I agree with you, having found clozapine to be effective that’s a big win and if it works it works I’d stick with it and adjust levels accordingly. My ex paranoid sz managed quite well from a younger age in clozapine (full insight) well into our thirties. As long as he was taking it… There was some weight gain later when he became more consistent with it, but he was able to stay active and finally finished getting a work license he’d been working on for 15 yrs… Hopefully things go well at your son’s appointment and thi

176269426,"No problem. My brother, who has bipolar disorder, does a bit of the pet words thing and adopts an odd speaking cadence when he’s unwell. He’s creative with language at times, and many of his utterances are obscure references to books and tv shows he’s familiar with. Some of it sounds reminiscent of _NAME_ _USER_ID_ or _NAME_. If you ask him, he’ll explain them in great detail. Whether I bother or not depends on my mood and amount of free time. I agree it’s best to take this as it comes. I imagine it’s easier to take than a flat affect or mono _USER_ID_ speech. I remember as I was making the transition from my rather long prodrome to psychosis/delusional thinking, a friend of mine said she was worried about me because I seemed to be losing my sense of humor.

Recently he blocked the family from calling or texting him. I went to his apartment to check on him and his apartment was a mess, his clothes were filthy, and hi bedroom smelled like urine. It broke my heart. I keep trying to get him to take his meds but he doesn’t listen to me. It’s almost like I’m his enemy. I hate to see him like this but i don’t know what else to do. My hands are tied."

176269434,"I feel like moving from IL! At the same time I wonder if our son would be willing to go with us. Would New Roads accept the medicare medicaid cards! In 2019 he spent most of the year in and out of the hospitals, 3 weeks in 3-4 days out, he was the ‘frequent flyer’ because he was not complying with meds and though he was at the hospital it doesn’t mean he was getting better for the same reason. He used up almost his entire lifetime days coverage by Medicare! Now we’re at a crossroads again; there’s supplements that he is trying but one little supplement now and then it’s not going to work. He’s very hard to talk to into even vitamins or alternatives; I’m doubting myself, what others do to succeed in getting their loved ones into treatment? I realized each case is a little different and it is what it is!!! I need to check into New Roads. Thank you for sharing your experience with us the 1% (I really think it’s more than that)"
176269435,"A nuance here I think is important: Trust is a two-way street. When you jump in and tell psychiatrists and others about symptoms and other PHI, what you imply to your daughter is you don’t trust her to manage her illness on her own, and possibly set her up for life-long dependency. I feel for parents in these situations, because it becomes an ultramarthon of parenting. The choice of when to step in and when not, is always difficult, but the eventual goal is for children to manage their own lives. Trust is also a big part of learning, which is what recovery is all about. Learning to cope with your new “reality” and when and how to ask for help if you need it. And this is a lot harder without bonds of mutual trust."
176269436,That’s why I like to do it just as the sun comes up these days. It’s still cool out. Otherwise it is too hot here also.
176269437,I get this a lot. I also have had a hallucination choke me.
176269438,"One of the hardest things I had to do was to say no to some of the things he wanted to do early on, like working, we tried several working options in various settings at various times of day etc, and each time the stress would cause him to lose ground and lose wellness and clarity, you could see him begin to unravel sometimes slowly and sometimes in minutes. It might have been having to not smoke except on assigned breaks and in assigned areas. It could be sticking to a specific schedule or even changing a schedule or really anything, new people showing up, someone raising their voice loudly. Finally I put my foot down and just said no more. Stability is too important. More important than social or economic achievement. He has been relatively stable ever since I conscientiously removed most all of his external stress factors. My son is average intelligence, and had leaning disabilities in school, classes were really hard for him. He still, (like all young men) wanted to feel the importance of havin
g a job and his own income, he worked when he was 14 at a local grocery store that had a special work/study program and he did very well, but it was the next year or two after that he started showing signs of being ill and running with a bad crowd that drank and smoked pot and cut school. I was always a single parent and I dropped my kids off at the front door of the school each morning before I went to work, only to find out much later that my youngest (my sz son) walked straight through the school and out the back door. School and work went by the wayside and the nightmare began so to speak. My oldest son is not sz -I do believe he is on the spectrum though with undiagnosed high functioning asperger’s, I say this because he reminds me a bit of what you said about your son having a mind that never shuts off and being very smart and placing studies at a high value. My oldest is like that, he is 37 and married and lives on the west coast. He teaches English part time at an immersion school for Chinese and Ja
panese students. His wife is Chinese and he speaks Mandarin and Japanese and a few other languages but he can’t handle social stress and he tends to come across as distant and unapproachable to others. He has come close to what I call a breakdown when he was trying to go for his masters in language and work at the same time. He came close to another breakdown when his wife had to go to visit her parents in China without him and he was left alone with full responsibility for everything for a month. He barely ever calls me (normally) but at that time I think he called me twice a day and always under great duress. He hasn’t “cracked” yet -but I always worry that it runs in the family-because it does in ours. My point is that it is my solid belief that in this fast paced high expectation day and age-stress in all of its varied forms is the _NAME_ enemy to mental health and stability. I wish you better days ahead."
