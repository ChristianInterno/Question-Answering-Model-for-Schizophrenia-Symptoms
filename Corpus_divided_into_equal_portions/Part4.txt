175906021,"I can’t speak for all addicts or alcoholics but for me, when I finally got serious about my drug problem and joined AA (yeah, I got clean from drugs in both CA and NA) and I committed myself to the program After about 3 months of regular meeting attendance, I went to bed one night with strong cravings and the obsession and compulsion to use was so strong that my old way of thinking took over. I laid in bed and made plans to take a bus to some family friends house in the morning, borrow a $100 and then take the bus 10 miles to my old drug haunts and buy some rocks and smoke them. I felt the old familiar anticipatory high and fell asleep. I awoke the next morning and my first thought was: that was totally crazy. My plans were totally crazy. And that morning my obsession and compulsion to use were lifted from me and since that day in 1990 those feelings have never come back. I am never tempted to use. I have too much of the AA and CA program in me to use. It’s 31 years later and I’ve been to ove
r a 1000 meetings. The program works."
175906022,"I get confused when people start channelling, I can’t make sense of anything."
174330305,"In second grade, I was taken out of class for being too quiet. I think I was told I was special or something. We went to a different classroom. We were singled out. I don’t remember much, but we did weird stuff to increase our social skills and did games and crap. Looking back, I think it was a gifted and talented program, but it could have been the opposite. I don’t know. I never was tested back then. I had some minor behavioral problems, but I also was good at computers back then. In middle school, I tested average or something. I was never in gifted programs because I was always behind. I rarely studied and hated school. I got poor grades or average grades despite being more intelligent than most. I was a loner and got bullied and never had friends. I blame my parents, especially my father. I went to private schools which were a lot worse than public schools. I never figured out what it was. High school was a breeze but I did poorly. I couldn’t even get into any college or anything. I didn
’t know how to study and I hated learning. My grades were poor. I was humiliated constantly. It was an every day thing. I rarely attended. But I was always smart enough to get through high school. It was a joke looking back. My niece is in the gifted program. She’s a lot like me except way more intelligent. She’s way more creative too. She doesn’t study but gets good grades and aces every math test. I think there is a huge correlation between being a loner, having poor social skills and developing schizophrenia later on. I think the average IQ for math majors at my former school was 130. I looked it up. I failed and dropped out so I always assumed I was below that – like 120. I would say schizophrenia has lowered that to 110. I don’t care. I rather be happy, brush my teeth, and take showers. It’s sad because I still have desires and dreams and like challenges of someone much smarter than myself. I take after my grandfather. My uncle is pretty smart too."
175906023,"Glad for you, Om… Me, I raise my ap. You know, my doc said that my fears keeps me from functioning, not so much my negatives. But lets see. Keep it like this, you. _PERSON_, fewer meds is always better."
175906024,"I’m not sure what you mean by that. Do you mean forgetting your name as in forgetting where you come from, who your family is? Or do you mean literally being so brain-fogged that you forget your name? I once forgot whether or not I was right or left handed for about 10 minutes. But seriously, I’ve never been ashamed of my family, even though we didn’t have much money and were the only atheists."

175906036,Wow I just dont know how you manage your negative symptoms and still be able to do art. I cannot do anything now because I feel like my medication abilify disables me to a point where I cannot do any of my hobbies but it’s the only antipsychotic with the least side affects where I am.
175906037,No more of these intrusive thoughts. They are the worst thoughts people are putting in my mind. I want my own mind. Please help.
174330311,Yes it did but I’ve accepted it and I have a story to share it has made me more understanding of others with MI and I want to share my experiences and help break _USER_ID_. It’s hard but I wouldn’t change it.

175906042,"Good luck, but please seek help with your sobriety, because it’s much safer and more sustainable to stay sober with help. How long have you been drinking, and how much? Alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous without medical intervention. My friend’s mom suffered severe brain damage because she tried to sober up on her own and had a seizure."
175906043,"Grief involves sadness. Not sad my dad died. Every day he’s gone, our relationship improves. Now, my mother… I don’t talk about her on here much. She fought a brave and valiant battle with breast cancer for 2.5 years and lost in NOV 1993. She was very active in my childhood in helping me explore new interests and doing anything she could to give me an edge - especially academically. My dad left her six months before she died. She was devastated, and I could tell. She tidied up her affairs and had her will rewritten in her final days, not wanting to succumb to the pain meds, she held off on going under until everything was lined up. Then she used the morphine clicker thingy for only a day, went into a coma, and passed 2 days later. Never seen such heroism. (Teary eyes are forming.)"
175906044,Yeah thanks _AT_MENTION_ This is what my therapist was trying to tell me. That I’m more than my diagnoses and labels. I’m just a little frustrated that my psychiatrist is still uncertain after all these years of knowing me. Maybe I ought to be a better communicator.
175906045,Yes you were completely right. I don’t need it anymore so I’m going to stop taking it. I’ll keep it as a prn though but I’ll just have to accept I’ll feel hungover after I use it.
174330323,"My paranoia is almost gone, but I take two aps. I ended up with mild tardive dyskinesia, random tongue and finger movement. Doesn’t bother me so we aren’t treating it right now. If it gets worse we will. I also had good results adding a supplement, Lion’s Mane. I noticed a drastic drop in anxiety and paranoid intrusive thought. This was before we added Abilify so I know it was the supplement. I was able to be on my own in a store without freaking out and scouting the store for my husband. I didn’t lie awake at night thinking about who was stalking me."

174330320,"My doc said that if TD progresses, it can start to affect the muscles that control your internal organs, like your diaphragm and stuff. He said that it can interfere with breathing. I think it is probably a risk-benefit analysis every time a patient presents with TD, but in my case he thinks the risks of staying on are greater than the risks of tapering off. And I will be closely monitored during this time. I’m nervous, but I haven’t had any positive symptoms in nearly 4 years, so there is a chance I will be okay."
175906049,"Not feeling numb is a start. That means you can work with it. The type of emotions aren’t fun, but they’re flowing at least. Happy thoughts for happy emotions. Reinforcement of the good. I’m wishing you well EH!"
175906050,I generally like more soothing colors such a lilac or lavender or light yellow. Hmmm…I just ordered some fabric face masks in light lilac and light blue. Perhaps that will sooth me when I go grocery shopping?
175906051,"Worry is natural, especially if youve had it before. Your subconscious brain, like every one'ss, is constantly scanning for worst case scenario, it's job is to keep you safe. Your worry isnt just you worrying, its a protection mechanism of your brain. If you talk to your brain and calm it, say 'i know you are presenting me with this worst case scenario to protect me, but i also know that there's no point me using up energy on worry without there actually being an issue. Thank you for warning me but I trust im okay, I just have a cold and I'll allow myself to worry IF i actually need to.' If you keep talking to your brain it has a calming effect and also becomes a pattern interupt. The trust is, 99.9%of what we worry about never happens. I used to worry about everything all the time but these techniques really helped me. Hope they help you too, _NAME_"
174330324,"I’m also on Abilify and don’t seem to notice a drastic change from day to day. I’ll have a few bad days in a row, then things will kind of even out. You may want to talk to your pdoc about this, It doesn’t sound healthy for you."
175906052,Paroxetine didn’t work for me. There was actually a lot of trial and error before they found the right antidepressant that worked for me. I hope that it works for you.
175906053,Good you got out. Your not in quarantine then. Did you wear a mask? I’m struggling with apathy and am hoping tomorrow will be a better day.

175906055,I was 37 with a college degree and I got it in 3 months. Don’t worry about your age or education. If you’re truly disabled and can’t work then you’ll get it.
175906056,mine is similar to urs _AT_MENTION_ … im mostly visual… i ate alotta acid too & i mostly only hear things if exhausted or get trauma triggers… If im reminded of some traumas… I will hear chattering or pink _NAME_ style music from the fan or half asleep.
175906057,can’t you ask the nurses? they can contact your pdoc probably. or get put on the list to see the doctor asap.
175906058,I thought I remembered you from before not wanting to take them.
174330325,"During winter, with severe negative symptoms, i tried alcohol in order to feel something again. Some days I threw up, and I became disgusted by it."

175906067,"man, I guess everyone thinks I’m some kind of jerk now…I am not going to post anymore I don’t think."
175906068,I have phone call phobia. My husband thinks I’m a scaredy cat! He has to make almost all the calls. My heart palpitates too much.
175906069,"But it’s about the dialectic right. There’s the dialectic between fiery beauty, psychosis, meaning, mania, spiritual exaltation and the humdrum of everyday life, stability, placidity, and peace. Do I choose TRUTH or do I choose PEACE?"
175906070,And it came from my own voice. It came from copying a significant other who had hurt my feelings the same way.
175906071,"I am turning 32 this year, while I feel like achieved a lot so far, I want more money and a bigger house. But my health is not improving as the years go by. I am better managing my illness but the symptoms suck and I feel suicidal a lot of the time."
175906072,I watched some guy stack patio chairs up to try and get over the roof. He didn’t make it. He would just start singing out of nowhere.
175906073,Come on girl. Be smart about this. You’re 15 you’re not 5. Talk to your doctor
175906074,According to my brother I snored when we used to sleep in the same room. He even filmed me snoring to make me hear it lmao

175906077,I'm doing okay. Staying pretty stable. Was told I was psychotic last week but IDK. I felt fine.
175906078,True. I’ll talk to my husband about it and see if I can’t break away once a week for therapy.
174330329,"I’m not so keen on the medication. I perfectly understand why people want to stay on it, I am staying on it myself at the moment, but I don’t want to be on it for life. I feel like a baby with schizophrenia and I put it down to the medication messing with my brain, I can no longer look after myself in the same way I could before. I take 400mg of Clopixol per month, yet the medication makes me very sleepy – I sleep in until about 1-3 pm each day."
175906079,Interesting find!
175906080,I like the second one
175906081,"Hi _PERSON_, I’m doing okay. Yes, I’m still living with my friend. I have two teaching jobs, though I’m not working either right now, not for another three weeks. Good luck with the new apartment!"
175906082,Demons fight me.
175906083,Go buy a book for a baby shower. Go to Fish store to ask for advice. My _NAME_ is fin nipping the tetras pretty badly. Attend meeting from 7-8:30 tonight. And somehow deal with disdain from my husband for attending.
175906084,"My psychosis has been getting steadily worse over the past few weeks, thought broadcasting, hearing voices, thought withdrawal. I saw my therapist yesterday and he thought I was handling it well, but part of me wonders if it is time to go to the hospital. So, how do y’all know when it’s time to go inpatient? Or do you have to have a doctor or family tell you."
175906085,"I’d like to be a robot, but I’m a cyborg who is still mostly human. I’m working on getting more artificial parts."
175906086,Why would this be too personal? There’s a lot of invega trashing on here.
174330334,"Yeah the whole 1% thing, why can’t I be the 1% who is wealthy instead of the 1% who deals with schizophrenia?"
175906087,"Sustaining life and family is more important than owning a TARDIS, but the Queen is still a little greedy, she fancies herself as a Doctor, I tried to warn her that she wasn’t my girlfriend, but she insisted that she should take responsibility. In truth she is _PERSON_, that is who I am looking for, as the Master and the _NAME_, not the _PERSON_, who I adore, she experiments on animals, who is going to be next(?) I shudder to think"
175906088,Usually something prompts it. It could be something very minor but in my mind it warrants an outburst. I think CBT can help if you have uncontrolled anger.
175906089,The best thing to do is talk to your medical team like you’re going to do.
175906090,"It’s not really based on it being a man or woman, moreso on the type of person or character that individual is. We all have different personality traits."
175906091,"My sister just saw her doctor and she referred her to a psychologist who said she's having panic attacks. So that's 3 of us in the family that have them. My mom developed panic disorder after she was diagnosed with leukemia, I've had it since I was 18, and my sister now has it at 46"

175906094,I shower twice a week or my hair gets oily…that’s quite enough for me…I have this new body soap that tingles when I get out so I really like that.
175906095,"Maybe the problem is that you’re not bothering people enough , lol. Cuss someone out and we’ll all be happier."
175906096,"They told me I had special mind reading abilities because I could hear their voice. They used to call me a mindreader.Then I would begin to mistakenly overhear secrets’ of the _NAME_ (like they were selling guns to _NAME_, or they engage in human trafficking) and said I had to join the _NAME_ because I knew too much of their secrets. They said I shouldn’t have been able to hear them.this went on for months.they made up several other ways of putting me under pressure to join the _NAME_. As well as claiming I was freak that I could hear their voice they also made up curses such as an ‘insanity curse’ which when used made me feel intense panic like I was going even more crazy. And they were other curses as well. _USER_ID_; they told me I had to join from the start to escape hearing voices. This all tied in with intimidation I received IRL which makes it real to me."

175906103,It’s weird. I’ve been getting faint voices on my meds for the first time in 8 months. And I realized today that I kind of want to hear them louder and be able to understand what they’re saying. They are actually kind of interesting. I even kind of want to be friends with my mean voice if that’s even possible because I don’t want to fight them anymore and they make me feel like I have company. Maybe I’m going off the deep end.

I know I have about 13 small lesions in my right frontal lobe. I dont know if it’s my blood pressure or the somataform disorder. It’s all frustrating not being able to function properly. My gp did a neurological examination today and I was stumbling and unbalanced. If my illness is all psychiatric I dont understand the wooziness part. I cant even do simple things. Some days I think I have MS, other days I think I have schizophrenia. Is there any connection I wonder with the frontal lobe and schizophrenia? I think I read somewhere way back that there could be, but that’s not to say that’s proven medically. I’m just trying to find 
out what’s wrong with me, so I have read about MS and schizophrenia. I have been diagnosed with neither, and I’m under a big umbrella where somataform disorder is concerned. It has so many symptoms of it’s own! Anyway just thought I would update you nice people."

J Psychiatr Res. 2020 Oct 16;132:151-160 Authors: _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Abstract High-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (hf-tRNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique capable of increasing human cortex excitability. There were only published case reports on the use of hf-tRNS targeting the lateral prefrontal cortex in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia, thus necessitating systematic investigation. We designed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in a cohort of stabilized schizophrenia patients to examine the efficacy of add-on hf-tRNS (100-640 Hz; 2 mA; 20 min) using a high definition 4 × 1 electrode montage (anode AF3, cathodes AF4, F2, F6, and FC4) in treating negative sympt
oms (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04038788). Participants received either active hf-tRNS or sham twice daily for 5 consecutive weekdays. Primary outcome measure was the change over time in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Factor Score for Negative Symptoms (PANSS-FSNS), which was measured at baseline, after 10-session stimulation, and at one-week and one-month follow-ups. Among 36 randomized patients, 35 (97.2%) completed the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significantly greater decrease in PANSS-FSNS score after active (-17.11%) than after sham stimulation (-1.68%), with a large effect size (_PERSON_’s d = 2.16, p < 0.001). The beneficial effect lasted for up to one month. In secondary-outcome analyses, the authors observed improvements with hf-tRNS of disorganization symptoms, unawareness of negative symptoms, subjective response to taking antipsychotics, and antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. No effects were observed on the neurocognitive performance and other outcome measure
s. Overall, hf-tRNS was safe and efficacious in improving negative symptoms. Our promising findings should be confirmed in a larger sample of patients with predominant negative symptoms. PMID: _PHONE_NO_ [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]"

175906231,I’ve been volunteering at my cricket club for well over a decade. I usually do 1 to 2 days a week of about 4 hours but it can be more or less. I do a lot of mowing and raking etc but have learned how to prepare a first grade quality turf wicket. It’s fun and interesting watching the grass grow and it really is a trade. I live on a pension and love my life. The volunteering gives me a purpose and something to do each week. I socialize and still play competitively. I really do recommend it. If I’m having a bad day I can just cancel and the guy I help out is a volunteer too so it’s all good. They pretty well all know I’m sz down there.

175906261,Well you don’t seem too distressed by it. So that’s a good sign. I think that’s key. If you’re able to keep a level head about it then you’ll probably do better. I sometimes panic when I get that sort of thing and need a little more help in dealing with it to get through it. It’s really a matter of what you’re safe with. You sound good though.
175906262,"I don’t think you’re faking it. Personally for me, I have had delusions that come and go as part of the self-discovery part. Did I ever say anything that was factually false? Sure, why not. I don’t remember every thing I’ve said over the years. I said I went to Mars, but realized now it wasn’t real combined with the fact we live in some ET test-tube, petri-dish thing and I’ve only been abducted 10 times or so since I first woke up in my first life a long time ago (my first life). It’s sometimes hard to grasp what you are saying for the average person. Could be writing style or vocabulary. I think you should get a degree in philosophy or something since you enjoy it and are good at it. You come off honest in this thread. Sometimes what works for 1 person, doesn’t work for another, and vice versa. Conspiracy theories work for me. Some people gravitate towards them. I don’t really like the term ‘conspiracy theorist’ or ‘conspiracy theory’ because it’s a derogatory term as I 
have discovered some time back. People say it was invented by the government to discredit credible researchers."
175906263,"So I discussed sarcosine with my GP today, he’d never heard of it so he has emailed a psychiatrist. Hopefully I’ll get the go ahead to try it. He did say that sodium valproate is definitely not an antidepressant but we still need to check if its compatible. I don’t know if I’m just lazy, I certainly seem to be able to write in small bursts, but that is part of the processing of my experiences. Finding energy to do anything else like study or tidying my room and washing my clothes is really hard. Every time I think about doing something productive, a huge lethargy comes over me. The only thing I can really do is try and get all my thoughts out of my system. I read over five pages of my book on theories of chakras again yesterday before 2pm and want to do the same again today. There are many other things I want to do, but I want to establish reading as a routine first before attempting more. In the past few years I’ve been quite good at setting up small routines of study for a month or so, 
and I want to see how far I can push it. I’m nowhere near having enough concentration to work, but establishing small routines is good for my general well-being and mental health. So for the time being, I’m just going to concentrate on making sure I read at least five pages of a book each day. I have so many books I want to study, and at five pages a day, it will take me a long time, but hopefully, gradually, I can build up. Thank you."
175906264,I have enough energy to lounge around on the sofa all day so I don’t normally notice that I’m lacking in energy. But I went out this weekend with my brother for a few hours and the following day I met my little nieces for a few hours. Not much activity but I was wasted after it. What are people doing to increase their energy levels?

175906268,"I’m ramping up into a period of mania, and it’s difficult to sit still and write. I have no interest in live-blogging a manic episode, but I do want to share what I’m feeling right now. I was in deep work for weeks on a book I’m writing, and I was quickly lost reading a series of _PERSON_ cover versions from Hogarth Press when things began to slip away. I’d been applying myself with self-discipline for weeks, so it’s odd that at first I didn’t notice things changing. Suddenly, I just wanted to be out gardening. Problem is, it’s October and there’s not much gardening to do. But that wasn’t going to stop me. Wednesday morning the mums in the flower boxes began to bother me. The unusually wet and hot weather we’ve had turned the flowers brown, and I thought if I deadheaded the plants I could see if they would bloom again as things cooled down. So I picked every flower off of every mum. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/older-bipolar/2019/10/in-me-now-mania-grows/"

I don’t think the smoking makes my visions go away (not that I want them too), but it does help me focus the voices. I get to pick and choose which stream of information I tap onto. Without smoking, I quit for three years prior to diagnosis, I felt a lot of anxiety. Then I had to deal with severe panic attacks. They dissipated when I took up smoking again. I wish I could get nicotine supplements in pill form but they are illegal in my country."

Many “coincidences” happened in my life and I was excited due to them, sometimes I was excitated, agitated, felt really good (like in euphoria?) and had severe and loud autostimulating behaviors (which are symptoms of autism spectrum disorder). If I believe that bad, evil-containing games from Fallout series (or their total conversion mods) contain something which is a “message” (or better “sign”) for me, does I have a delusion or schizophrenia? Or it is “just” something like unconventional belief associated with schizotypal (personality) disorder?"

175906317,Invega did well for the positive symptoms but it made me gain 40 pounds in 9 months plus I started lactating while on it so I had to stop it. I also felt dead and emotionless on it. Risperidone gave me horrible akathisia and I wasn’t on it long enough to tell if it worked for my symptoms or not. Geodon is my gold in pill form. It works well for my positive symptoms while not making me feel dead or emotionless. It doesn’t get too sedating plus it’s great for weight neutrality. I take Geodon in combination with Loxapine and it does the trick for me. _USER_ID_ to add what LED said about Geodon making you gain weight. You do have to eat when you take a dose but it doesn’t make you extra hungry so it doesn’t really cause weight gain as long as you’re taking it along with your normal meal times and not eating extra just to take your meds. Geodon doesn’t make you hungry
175906318,i’m on a 2 weekly shot of risperdal consta 50mg and then 200mg clozapine day. That works well for me.
174330397,"Since adding Abilify 10mg to my Invega 234 mg, I find I am feeling more normal. I have some motivation. Been doing more small tasks around the house. Went for a bike ride the other day and a couple walks. I really feel less blah. Look forward to things. I’m really happy to have asked a second time about Abilify and made it clear how much I was suffering from negatives and side effects so that my pdoc agreed to try it. It’s a good feeling now. I don’t feel hopeless and mired in muck."
175906319,"I’ll add it to the list of problems to bring up to the doc then, haha"
175906320,That was her bad all the way. I’d be pissed too
175906321,"p.s. if anyone is interested in ‘healthy ageing’ here’s a great article about the relationship between diet/exercise and age-related disease prevention .

175906323,"As far as I can tell, from what little is published. In this study, using a 60mg dose (42mg is the dosage they have settled on for the trials) the occupancy peaked at 39% 1 hr post dose. Comparing that to one of the other ones that has fairly low D2 occupancy, quetiapine, it took 8 hours for that drug to get to 40% occupancy (it starts around 65%). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0251-1 Most of the nasty dopaminergic side effects start around >60% occupancy."
175906324,"_AT_MENTION_ A separation is devastating! There are so many unanswered questions, regrets, broken promises, and unfulfilled dreams.

175906325,"I have a friend who is sza, bipolar type and she is normally in a mixed state of both depression and hypomania even while on an AD and an AP. Her pdoc recently put her on an AD med called Cymbalta and she says that this has made her very, very sleepy (she sleeps night and day), and it also takes away all of her motivation and energy. (It is also responsible for her quitting smoking, quitting of her Pepsi habit, and the end of her irritability, severe depression and severe anxiety.) While she loves all the benefits of the medication, she bemoans her lack of motivation and sleepiness. Is anyone here familiar with Cymbalta and know if the medications amotivation and drowsiness side effects go away with time? I appreciate any responses."

174330389,Neither do I but that’s just the way it is. All the complaining in the World won’t make it go away. We’ve just got to cope with it. Weight gain- I’ve heard that a few drugs are weight neutral but if the drug that works best with the voices is not then I suggest just to keep in mind that some people like plus sized women if you are worried about that. Other advice is that the voices are actually as human as you are and if you feed them garbage and criticism they’ll dish it out back to you. A sense of humor helps with the voices. And remember you are not alone. Others have it too and although every psychosis is different there are many similarities as well. Good luck.

174330396,"I have to agree with you, I never had any of the positive symptoms of sz, but was prescribed a AP and given a diagnosis I feel was inaccurate. I was first diagnosed at 18. I’m 26 now and I don’t know how much longer I will be on this medication. The medication has given me negatives and declined my ability to think. I feel like I don’t have too many of my young years left. I’ve accomplished very little during this time in my life. I used to have more energy, intelligence, could react quicker and was more coordinated. Medication has robbed me of my confidence in every aspect of my life. God willing I will one day be in a position to decrease or even come off these mentally addictive drugs. Slowly but surely I will find my way."

175906341,I’ve felt that a good bit up until I met my husband and had my baby because of my age and pain but in completely different context. I guess you have to find something more meaningful than what might be next. The world is full and depression is emptiness. Fill yourself with things of the world. Sights smells sounds tastes and all come from new experiences.
175906342,Thing is.. I am around people who will refuse to vote other than republican and have very closed minded and think minorities are below them.

I stand corrected. I apologize. Now I have abut 10-15 minutes and wish to work with you.

174330423,"Hey I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2003. After a relapse in 2005, I was prescribed amisulpride and the voice finally got quiet enough to not notice anymore in 2012. My illness catalyst was smoking too much cannabis back in my late teens/early 20s. Unless I’ve ingested THC, those illness demons have been a memory. I now live in the US, and given what’s going on in the world at the moment, and amisulpride not FDA approved yet, I’ve been unable to ship in my monthly amisulpride prescription - which has been Sulprix. A psychiatrist has prescribed me Vraylar and I do not like it one bit. I’m on 1.5mg every other day, and I’m also on a lower dose (100mg - was previously 200mg daily) of amisulpride to transition the two. I know we’re all different and respond differently to substances, but, I feel like I’ve regressed 10 years after only three days. I’m just not myself at all. There’s been a couple of times the post has been delayed and I’ve been without amisulpride befo
re, for up to two weeks one time - how I feel right now is not the same. Over the last year, I’ve discovered that smoking hemp (high CBD with very low THC) has improved my brain activity regardless - so I’m not sure, wondering? if that could help as I’ve not smoked some in almost two weeks (it’d become a regular thing given the positives I’d noticed from smoking it) I believe that Vraylar is also prescribed for bipolar disorder… well I’m feeling like I’ve developed something else overnight - I’m snapping at my kid, my wife, pets, I feel like I’m about to start crying for no reason, it’s awful. I’ve gone from being a regular man to a nervous wreck - in three days! that can’t be normal, surely. Might sound like a pity party, that’s not my intention here. It’s my first post after my wife found the website. I’m looking for anyone who has been on, or uses Vraylar currently and can either relate and maybe tell me it’ll get better on the stuff.

Mainly by boosting my confidence. At the same time, I am devouring Spanish language apps: Babbel, _NAME_ Stone, and now, Duolingo. And they are all helping me immensely. Last night, I got the chance to speak Spanish with a native speaker who lives in the US!!! In my long experience, Latinos who live in the states always prefer and insist on speaking English to Americans rather than listening to American’s lousy Spanish. At least this has been my experience. Last night this Latino man did not hesitate to speak Spanish with me the whole time of our interaction! That’s a milestone for me.

174330418,"So I’ve had schizophrenic symptoms since I was 12 (probably triggered by puberty) and I am now 17. During this time the symptoms have had a _USER_ID_ like effect where sometimes there is some, non, or a overwhelming amount. And during this time it has had characteristics of different subtypes with paranoid schizophrenia with full auditory hallucinations and strong spiritual delusions, disorganized schizophrenia with symptoms including but not limited to depression, apathy, horrible short term memory, horrible hygiene, no daily routine, loss of pleasure in everything (including sexual encounters,) and most recently catonic schizophrenia which includes tremors, moments where I cannot break lose from a pose, moving in certain ways (like tapping my fingers or rocking) for hours at a time, and staring intently into my own reflection for 10 minutes or longer unable to break the trance. I’ve been able to deal with the delusional part after breaking my Antichrist belief where I thought Satan could comm
unicate with me. Since then the paranoia has eaten into itself leaving a neutral belief. Instead of thinking about being poisoned, I get paranoid about giving in to such delusions. I question every question I ask, for example my teacher found out that I went to rod run with my family despite her having no way to know that. After that happened a fellow classmate I don’t normally talk with asked how she knew that, which lead me to believe that was a hallucination even though there has been no evidence that I had imagined him saying that. I had never suspected any plot against me, but I had delusions about having delusions. Anyone experience anything similar and if you have could you give coping advice? Thanks"

If you are going to take supplements I would talk to the doctor first. Do you take medications for depression and anxiety? Do you see a psychiatrist or a therapist? I think you need more help than you are getting. Though I am really not sure how much you are getting at this time. I hope you feel better soon _PERSON_. Hugs, _NAME_..."

174330429,"I think everyone in the world has some unusual beliefs that can’t be proven or disproven. It’s just part of the human brain trying to make sense of a confusing world. It only becomes a delusion when we let our life be negatively impacted by those beliefs. For example, Mr. Star believes in reincarnation. It’s definitely an unusual belief that can’t be proven or disproven. But he doesn’t let that belief hurt himself or those around him, so it isn’t a delusion. By contrast, I spent a long time believing I was a demon. I ran away from home and lived homeless for months because I was worried I would kill my family with my demonic powers. That was a delusion, and a pretty extreme one, because it got in the way of living a healthy life."

Did you find it?” And then laughter. Very clear auditory hallucinations. I had to turn on all the lights, eat some food, make sure I was REAL, in my body, before I could get calm again.

I’m happy cuz he needs to relax. I did this dog scanner app. I thought it was BS even tho it got good reviews. I scanned _USER_ID_’s face and it said she was an Australian Kelpie. And I thought, “that’s bull. This app is trash”. Cuz we thing she’s a shepherd. Well!, I googled it and she had the exact markings in the EXACT places as an Australian Kelpie and a whole bunch of other things. I was like “well, damn ok”. I scanned _PERSON_’s face and it said he was mostly German Shepherd plus a bit of other things. Which fiancé had told me. I scanned _PERSON_’s face and it said mostly domestic long hair. So maybe _USER_ID_ is an Australian kelpie."
175906479,"That’s weird, I can tell the pharmacy not to fill anything written if I don’t want it. Doc gets no say in what I can stop. And if I want vitamins I have the red Flintstones gummies that don’t contain several of the things I cannot process. I get them at Walmart for 6 bucks a 120 count. I had to look, but since I can’t process folic acid, vitamin d, iron, and there’s 1 more these are the best for me. I even gave an unopened bottle to my pdoc so others that have the stupid gene mutation I have can see what they can get. But again, a pharmacy doesn’t fill RX for vitamins and iron here, it’s all OTC. Only OTC I get RXed is Zyrtec allergy med, but I didn’t get that refilled this month as they went from 3.19 to 6.79 with no explanation. Yeah, still cheaper than OTC, but it hasn,t helped this spring and summer at all. So no reason to spend money on it right?"
175906480,"There’s a new med called Ingrezza you could bring up with your pdoc. It’s new which means expensive, but if you’re taking Austedo, it probably wouldn’t be an issue.

174330443,"Yeah I find this a sensitive issue. One because there’s a push (because of anosognosia) for patients to accept they have schizophrenia as a sign of good health. Then the thinking is that they will stay on medication and stay well. Makes sense but in my case it came across as overpowering how I was thinking about what was going on, not a dialogue at all. Also, I have gotten the feedback from some professionals that they’re not sure I really have schizophrenia, so all this effort I put into “accepting my diagnosis” seems likes unnecessary pain. Plus, who really wants to accept something like that?"

174330458,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Distinct Differences in Emotional Recognition According to Severity of Psychotic Symptoms in Early-Stage Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Patients with schizophrenia are characterized by deficits in their ability to identify facial expressions of emotion, which are associated with impaired social and occupational function. An understanding of the deficits of facial affect recognition (FAR) early in the course of the illness can improve early intervention efforts to ameliorate potential functional deterioration. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and correlations between psychotic symptoms and FAR deficits in patients with early-stage schizophrenia using data from the Korean Early Psychosis Cohort Study. Patients with schizophrenia were divided into three groups: 1) severely and markedly ill (n = 112), 2) moderately ill (n = 96), and 3) mil
dly ill (n = 115). These groups were compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The FAR test was developed using Korean emotional faces from the Korean Facial Expressions of Emotion database. Error rates, correct response times, and nonresponse rates of each subset were calculated. Several psychopathology assessments were also performed. There were significantly more deficits associated with the recognition of anger (p < 0.01), fear (p < 0.01), and contempt (p < 0.01) in the three patient groups than in the healthy control group. In the severely and markedly ill states, all emotions apart from surprise had impaired error rates (p < 0.01 for all analyses). The error rates for happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise, and neutral faces were not significantly different between mildly ill patients and healthy controls. All emotions, except for sadness, had significantly more delayed correct response times in all patient groups than in the healthy controls (p < 0.01 for all analyses). The severity of psycho
tic symptoms was positively correlated with the happiness and neutral error rates, and depression was positively correlated with the happiness error rates. General social function was negatively correlated with the error rates for happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. Overall, our results show that the severity of psychosis and clinical symptoms leads to distinct differences in certain emotions of patients with early-stage schizophrenia. It is considered that these specific emotional characteristics will help deepen our understanding of schizophrenia and contribute to early intervention and recovery of social function in patients with schizophrenia."

We managed a bit to calm me down with the zyprexa, but for the rest nothing… I am still sick mentally and i endure tough mental and body pain every evening… Only the klonopin helps a bit (which i was prescribed too, but i try to not take it very often)… I think that in the evenings, i have mostly this tremendoux anxiety from everything… Its so hard, that it disables my body… I cant move and i find myself here with racing worrying thoughts in my head… I tried 11 aps and none of them didnt ‘‘relax’’ these worries… They told me i am a paranoid sz with mostly negative symptoms and probably with borderline too… But should i continue enduring so much pain, while working alone on my symptoms?.. I even cant move in the afternoon. My energy gets low, but my head is working as hell… But i had a bit of dementia too now i find… Maybe because my thoughts are 
mostly paranoid, thats what said it to me my pdoc… But when i take a klonopin, my body feels better and i even start to think more ‘‘saner’’… But unfortunately, every evening its still gets the same story - tiredness first, then i sleep for a few, then worries after it and with those cognitive deficits that i have… Tbh, i have some friends and i have a slight progress in my mind… But should i cotninue doing my efforts even though that now its very painful? Or i should seek more meds lol??? Plus, which meds, i am sure i dont like the other 10 aps, i tried them all. I can take more often the klonopin, but why i think with a racing speed and only about paranoid things like this in the afternoon? Even the zyprexa doesnt calm this at all, which is strange lol … So just to know - should i continue fighting despite the tremendous pain??? Who else made it better with efforts too?

175906663,"Quitting vaping is exactly as hard as quitting smoking, at least for myself. Till this day I could not quit one of these. At the end of next week I’m getting liquid that I ordered. I still have a vape left. Even if I’m scared because of an explosion of the vape device that I’ve seen on the internet. Here where I live it’s easier to get tobacco than liquid. And that’s the only real reason I didn’t turn into a vaper. I would clearly decide for vaping. When you mix your own liquid it’s cheaper than smoking. two weeks of vaping with 9mg nicotine cost me 30 €, when I don’t need new coils. Where as smoking costs me 30 € per week. And that’s only so cheap because I make my own cigs, either roll or use a stuffing device. The best thing about vaping is that you can easily vape for two hours non stop, just refilling the liquid, being connected with a usb cable to the laptop with a vape that got usb passthrough.

174330480,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov High risk genotypes for schizophrenia may have been adaptive in the context of smallpox. J Block, Medical hypotheses, Jan 2020 07 Schizophrenia is known to impair reproductive and occupational functioning, and thus, the condition would appear to be a poorly adaptive trait. In contrast to expectations, the high frequency of schizophrenia, coupled with the existence of differing but analogous high schizophrenia risk polymorphisms across the globe, suggest that high risk schizophrenia genotypes could have experienced some positive rather than negative selection pressures. Indeed, the set of cellular and tissue processes influenced by schizophrenia - including manipulations of oligodendrocyte development, complement mediated immunity, VRK2, sulfation of heparin, IL-18, availability of glutamate, and interactions with sex hormones - overlaps with the set of cellular and tissue processes affected during Vaccinia encephalitis. Many schizophrenia-associated influences appear to oppose orth
opoxvirus related influences; and many of the proteins suppressed in the schizophrenia phenotype are proteins either produced by or necessary for Vaccinia. Accounts from the early part of the 20th century affirm that Vaccinia encephalitis resembles Variola encephalitis; and genomic sequencing studies confirm significant homology between the species. On the basis of similarity of Variola to Vaccinia, and on the basis of evidence derived from studies on Vaccinia and other orthopoxviruses, it is proposed that high schizophrenia risk genotypes may have served a protective function against smallpox."

175906715,There is a lot of talk from the successful folk of the world that go on about how losing is a part of success. Most people don’t try because they are afraid to lose. It really depends on how you define loss. Simply failing doesn’t necessarily mean loss… I’d suppose failing is more similar to wasting something not necessarily losing. The relation… success is measured in gains… failing to succeed is then a failure to make gains. But failing to make gains does not imply actually losing anything. Learning how to fail gracefully can make one less afraid of it… all the while lessons are learned throughout both failing and succeeding… therefore gains are actually always made and nothing is lost. Therefore it is always worth the effort if opportunity arises that doesn’t instigate jeopardy. Hope you are having a good one _AT_MENTION_

His parents first noticed a change in behavior when the patient became oppositional and defiant; however, he exhibited no _NAME_ antisocial behavior. The patient then became more withdrawn, although he continued to do well in school, maintaining close to an A average. His first psychiatric hospitalization occurred at age 12 and was occasioned by reports of persecutory hallucinations and delusions. His second hospitalization approximately 7 months later involved transfer to a facility several hundred miles away from home for extended care. He was treated at that facility for 3 months before returning home approximately 3 weeks prior to his suicide attempt and this admission. His diagnosis upon dischar
ge from his second inpatient admission was schizoaffective disorder; his medication regimen at the time of that discharge was aripiprazole, 60 mg/day, and fluoxetine, 60 mg/day. He was on this regimen at the time of this admission.

However your notes on the power of now are really helpful. I’ve read the book before, but don’t remember any of what you’ve written explicitly. Are they your own words? They’re really good quotes. I’m particularly taken by the negative self talk like “I must”, “I have to”, “I should” which implicitly means “I don’t want to”, and that procrastination saves us from anxiety. I make myself anxious by trying to fight procrastination with the negative self talk. So thank you once again.

saying this is making me really anxious. It’s so ingrained in me to fight procrastination, even setting targets makes me anxious"
175906784,"hate that. I look nice and I am smart. have inner power and will. bot I struggle with unbelievable things that not everyone sees. o.k but to deny this, why should I lie? I hate when they don’t believe me. ( it does not happen a lot but very annoiyng when it is)"
175906785,"I have never been to a mental hospital before. Granted, I am only two years into my illness. I still believe I should have gone a couple of times, but my parents just don’t believe in it. I think I should have gone when I was catatonic, anorexic, and just recently, pretty delusional."
175906786,Sounds good I like it
175906787,yea we had a good one til new people arrived and then I felt nervous as anything. but they are good to give a shot
175906788,"I can’t do these. It’s like mathematics, one negative variable makes the whole string of factors negative. My old man was a math major and I failed miserably at it. But I think there’s more to it. Like I have it in me, but I’m locked out. The opposite of locked in syndrome as told in the diving bell and the butterfly. Plus at work when it was my time to be positive someone asked me a follow up question. I said my vacation was great and he said what was so great about it. Maybe I’m just on a path to being bitter. I respect dear zombie which is why I’m sharing a dissenting type thing and explaining why I never participated in this thread."
175906789,I don’t think the whole world is broadcasting you and no one be that upset of your thoughts. What are the thoughts that you’re afraid of?
175906790,Do you drive? Do you have any bills?
175906791,I only shower once a week. That’s the most I can force myself to do. It’s just too much bother. As is everything else. And I’m not the least bit sad.
175906792,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ . I’m tired of struggling too.
175906793,"I’m approaching 40 now and still undecided about children. But it’s crunch time and if I want to be pregnant in the future, it will be expensive. Maybe I’ll adopt – if I get around to it."
174330502,"I admit that religious themes are very important and problematic for me. It is very hard. I have obsessions about oathing which are more or less associated with the religion. Coincidences are rather not disabling for me. They may have also religious meanings or trigger religious thoughts in my mind. I may function so low due to serious problems in spiritual area. Examination of conscience is something really hard for me. I would say that religious issues may have more impact on OCD than on schizotypal disorder/schizophrenia(?) in my case. Both OCD and StD/SZ may interfere with religion. I noticed some coincident things linking seven geometric or arithmetic sequences mentioned below: 3, 6, 12, 1, 4, 16, 0, 7, 14, 1, 7, 13, 2, 7, 12, 3, 7, 11, 4, 7, 10. They all are coincident for me. What links them? all have the same sum of numbers ( 21 ), all have the same arithmetic mean of numbers ( 7 ), all have the same number of numbers ( 3 , which is 21:7 and 12:4 ), all have the same number of digits ( 4 ) 
all have the same sum of digits ( 12 ) all have the same arithmetic mean of sums of digits in numbers building these sequences ( 4 ). So there is really huge coincidence with both 21 7 and 12 4, which I noticed only last night."
175906794,"I think I did too, looking back, _AT_MENTION_. Do you experience visual hallucinations?"
175906795,"I took haloperidol. I had akithisia with it, but Cogentin took that away."
175906796,"I’ve been on stabilizer with invega, but pdoc doesn’t know if I really need it. I’ll keep it for now incase I become manic with AD."
175906797,I cannot stop. Everyday they get worse. Breathing excersises. Meds. Nothing is helping. I have to lay in place for an hour till my heart is done pounding. I can’t take it anymore. I’m not saying I’m going to take my life I want to live. I feel like I’m going to snap. Or have a heart attack.
175906798,Me too _AT_MENTION_
175906799,"I watch peoples feet, if there instep with who there with or i count there steps, or even left right left right… People dont seem to notice cause im not making i contact even though im watchin them…"
175906800,They said if I did comply with them months ago they would have given me eternal life
175906801,Hope things settle down for you soon _AT_MENTION_. I have been doing ok. Have a four day weekend for Independence Day.
175906802,"Not for me, I tried it, it didn’t help at all: Mensah Medical – 16 Jul 16 Ashwagandha Dangers: This Herbal Remedy may have Repercussions Ashwagandha dangers may outweigh the benefits. Although touted as a remedy for adrenal fatigue, it doesn't consider the root cause or repercussions."
175906803,dont burn down the house lol
175906804,Put on clean shirts Put on perfume Put on my ring
175906805,"My day is going pretty good so far. Brought in some firewood, went for a walk, and played some guitar. The voices are there as usual, but I am winning today Cheers"
175906806,"If it ever did it before I wouldn’t worry, but this is new and the engine was super hot....going to check the coolant tomorrow...can’t open the lid while hot."
175906807,the whole 8 hours thing is a myth... We need at least 10 if not 12... lol
175906808,lamictal ruined my life
175906809,"Hey, doing pretty okay. Pretty much nailed most of my recovery regimen down. But a part of it is pretty risque, can’t really talk about it though. How are you?"
175906810,I was just wondering if anyone on risperidone smoked marijuana and had the same effect as I did. As soon as i smoked I started having visual distortions such as people bending in half and the top of the field of vision overlapping on the bottom. I also smoked marijuana a few times on paliperidone and never had this kind of effect which is surprising because they are supposed to be similar.
175906811,I used to think that I was the only one who would be picked as dictator for North Korea. Then I thought I was one out of a thousand who would also be picked. Now I’m slowly starting to think that none of that is true. I’m making progress I think! I just don’t know if I’m just thinking this because it’s how my family thinks. But if that’s the case then it might be good?
175906812,"I’m just over 2 years with my current psychiatrist. The one before I stayed 6-7 years, but I switched because he didn’t want to try to lower my meds. The attempt failed, but at least I got to try."
175906813,_PERSON_ hopefully I will. The leftover pizza seemed to calm my stomach. But I still cant sleep. I havent used the bathroom properly either for 2 days. I'm sure that is what's causing my stomach to hurt too.
174330504,Isn’t psychosis and schizophrenia the same?
175906814,What do you take for meds? Any PRNs?
175906815,"I’m kind of an a$$hole, or at the least, am very good playing that role. I have a long history here. I immigrated to these forums after the last iteration went kaput. I’m very difficult to handle. I’m too _NAME_ and upfront. I need to cool off more when I open my mouth (because I will invariably put my foot in it)."
175906816,It’s the machines fault. They put a nutcase on the top who in turn made bad people his inner circle. German soldiers would be executed themselves if they didn’t follow orders. People like _PERSON_ proves that many germans wanted a differerent world and future than hitler did. There were like 14 assasination attempts on hitler by his own people. You can’t blame a whole nation for what a few leaders did. Don’t be ashamed.
175906817,Its not like a daily supplement to take. Check your actual vitamin b12 level and if its not optimal (less than 500) then only take it and that too for some days or weeks and then retest the level if planning to take for longer period.
175906818,I know it sounds ridiculous but I’m scared of the injections because I was threatened with them before Anyone like me?
175906819,I am looking for something like that as well. Maybe we can start a peer support group here?
175906820,Dont know how they do it either.
175906821,What makes you think that?
174330505,It’s so hard to tell sometimes. Good luck!
175906822,Cute kitty even if it’s not yours SP
175906823,Yes you will. Keep ? HT.
175906824,I’m really sorry you have to put up with that kind of thing
175906825,"I never liked birthday parties, baby showers, celebrations, high school proms, dancing, wedding dresses, work suites, eating out for dinner, social rules, insurance companies, car registrations, politicians, justice, being apart of a group, changing the world in small ways, being punished or rewarded, getting in trouble, conflict.. But I like animals, idealizing utopia, being efficient in solving a problem without drama, explosions and chemical reactions, pretending that I'm in another world in my imagination, sneaking behind peoples backs, abusing my powers for good, having good friends that talk about philosophy and new ideas, innovation, music, art and math, experiencing new things and never staying in the same place."
175906826,Back taking Alli again to help with losing the few pounds I had gained will continue taking Alli until reaching a healthy weight for my body frame and height. Also taking Goli Apple Cider Vinegar gummies to maintain my weight so wish me Luck everyone on my weight loss endeavors I will never ever give up I am determined to beat and get past this plateau I am stuck right now but hopefully I will start losing once again then I can move on to other goals I wish to accomplish if any.
175906827,_PERSON_ I think talk therapy is so so important too for the daily. Because of the stress factor. Thankyou
175906828,I get weird intrusive thoughts that i snap out from very fast that are similar to psychosis friday i got a thought where i was a robot but i snapped out of it now a big one was my thought broadcasting i think it will be only one for now.
175906829,"I'm content, I don't really need outside factors or constant advancements to make me happy. I'm fine being who I am at this moment in life, wherever I may be. I guess what I'm saying is that my happiness comes from within"
175906830,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I’m better now than I was last night
175906831,_PERSON_…I should shut this down for moral reasons but funny!
175906832,Sounds a bit like ocd.
174330509,I’m trying to reality test by talking to people and seeing if I thought I’d be able to handle the people aspect of working again.
175906833,"Thing is I do so much from my phone that is almost impossible to. Computer I can do but not phone. My finances is on there, my email, I’m getting texts from my fiancé and dad periodically, etc so much more."

174330503,"I take 2 aps. I take Saphris 20 mg and Rexulti 3 mg. I also take a mood stabilizer, Topamax and an ad Cymbalta. What do you take?"
175906834,Anyone else experience the same
175906835,"Nobody will be able to say with definite evidence, but studies do show that faster treatment and stronger effort to control the symptoms early on does result in improved circumstances for the person affected — this is generally speaking and from reading through mostly medical literature If you weren’t showing clear symptoms at that age, many drs would have never seen or suspected. Believe in luck I’d say, the fact it was spotted when it was spotted must have a meaning! or it’s a coincidence which is good because it could have been hidden and not realised before it is too late?"
175906836,"Hi Rider52, So very sorry you are struggling with these things! I think your idea about seeing someone about this is a good one. Best to luck to you!"
175906837,More scratch art I made today
175906838,About people going after me. I just heard neighbor up stairs he said I don’t give a ????. What really does that mean? To whom why. I thought things were getting better. Sorry
175906839,_PERSON_ was wrong to state that five hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth is flat.
174330515,I have thought about going to prison. I’d rather live with my parents. I may not have complete freedom but being locked up for a long time would suck. I was ready to leave the hospital after 30 days! I couldn’t imagine life in prison. I can imagine life with schizophrenia. Kinda sucks!
175906840,How did it work out for ya
175906841,"I tried to become a doctor but had to quit due to my illness. Truthfully, if you really want to become a psychiatrist, go for it as long as you can handle it. I could not. I found that since I disclosed my illness and needed accommodations, I was not seen as someone who could handle being a regular doctor. I had to go through so many hoops to graduate and to enter an internship. I was glad to have been forced out due to my illness. I say this because I’m now teaching and love it. I don’t think I should have continued my path of becoming a doctor, it was my mother’s dream more than mine. The demands of being a doctor are too much for someone like me. Consequently, I was hospitalized about 7 times after quitting the medical field since I was non-compliant. So, my judgment is poor and I was lucky to not have been in a position to have caused harm to a patient as a doctor. I am happy with what I have. Also, getting licensure with an illness in the USA is a royal pain. The licensing board treats y
ou as if you had an addiction and they constantly monitor your every move. Truthfully, I would never encourage someone like myself to become a doctor. I also don’t want a doctor who is impaired either. So, I understand the reasons for the strict guidelines for medical licensure. But, if you are already becoming a psychiatrist and can get a license without problems in your country, then go for it!"
175906842,"_AT_MENTION_ i respect your view but many others haven’t full sz, are really only slightly"
175906843,Reminds me of pollock
174330514,I changed taking my Abilify from 4pm to 8am because it was keeping me up at night.
174330517,"It would have looked good from the outside I’m sure. But I come from a broken home and have problems from it. I’m 38 years old and I’m not sure who was in charge of raising me. My dad flaked off around 8th grade, and my mom doesn’t know much about the world we live in, so I didn’t learn much from her. I feel like I got left behind. But I’m schizophrenic now so all of that doesn’t matter much"
175906844,"_PERSON_…ask a doctor. We’re strangers on the internet and NONE of us are qualified to diagnose/treat you. You need a real, in-person meeting with a physician."
175906845,"_AT_MENTION_ I don’t think we can control where our weight loss comes from on our bodies. I lost in my bust first when I started, but I was happy about that! My C cups are now B cups. That suits me just fine! My belly went way down when I gave up soda. I used to drink 2-3 bottles of ginger ale a week, but I didn’t want to drink my calories, so I stopped it in March. My belly is WAY flatter and I don’t even miss it now. Good luck reaching your goals, you can do it! _AT_MENTION_ That sed rate is awesome! Your anti-inflammatory diet is working! Hopefully your weight loss starts again, it sounds like you are doing the right things! One of my friends on Sparkpeople does intermittent fasting and she swears by it."
175906846,Found you guys. Snapchat is dead. I’m a bit anxious. Couldn’t sleep all night.
175906847,"Really for weight loss the secret is to cut calories and to exercise, there is no magic pill that will make you really loose weight."
175906848,"my mother use to do that too me its been 4 years since the last time i saw her , am a lot better off now i got free from her with my partners help"
175906849,"no doubt. I’m in Canada, so it’s all covered, but I feel like they treat us like second class citizens. Mental health has such a long way to go. Personally I found when I’m not doing well, they can get very cruel. But when I’m on my way to recovery they get excited and are happy to interact with me. It’s strange, because really when I’m sick, what I need most is compassion. Instead they mess with me, feeding into my delusions."
175906850,I’m on both. So far they worked pretty good but I had to go on insulin for my diabetes. But now my blood sugar is very good. And my cholesterol is also a good.
175906851,"_AT_MENTION_, I am not poking fun. I am absolutely sincere. I too am a recorded, published, composer. I’ve also suspected at times, that my musical works were the result of grandiose manic delusion and that the whole world was laughing at me. I’ve since reconsidered. Here’s why: I had very well established, local musicians jump at the chance to record on all three of my CD’s. I had several hundreds of likes and thousands of views on my YouTube music videos. I got Official Youtube critical recognition for two of my albums in their Contemporary Classical Music Video category in 2012. And everybody among my relatives and friends, and even strangers, loved my music."
175906852,I took my meds this morning.
175906853,I cant really recommend zyprexa. And I dont know much about risperdal.
175906854,"There was a shooting outside this morning. They have this whole street blocked off. Anyway, I took some klonopin and did some meditation. I’ll do that procrastination meditation tomorrow morning so I can have a productive day."

175906858,how old is your niece?
175906859,That’s another 100 cans of diet Coke in the refrigerator.
175906860,they put bad thoughts into my mind making me think I’m a bad person. No can tell celebrities though.
174330525,One of my psychiatrists showed me what he wrote. Also you can guess what they’re writing. When I told him that I am Jesus well he wrote that and diagnosed me with schizophrenia.
175906861,I fear that my mom will kill me
175906862,we don’t know them so it’s hard to say if you should be worried about them but prob not i think. How long you known your friend?
175906863,Thanks _NAME_!
174330518,"Hi hon. For me psychosis is like an endless ACID/SHROOM trip. So yeah, that’s psychosis. It can be handled through meditation and Yoga. But some people choose anti-psychotics to alleviate the psychotic/sleep because anti-psychotics were invented by _NAME_ off when he discovered LSD so they basically counter-act LSD and psychosis. Abilify does this too. Effectively. My life is like an endless acid trip so I know what its like. Dont be afraid to reach out. It seems scarier when you feel alone but ur not alone there are people who also struggle with intense psychosis/delusions."
175906864,99 is not a fever…it could have been that you drank coffee or something before you took your temp? just thought of that… good luck…
175906865,Thanks for your replies! This is helpful to read your personal experiences with Lexapro(escitalopram).

That’s pretty much how I’m doing right now, along with the 14 stitches in my arm where I cut myself on purpose last week. These behaviors are what make me think the hospital would be useful for a few days."
175906869,"Yeah I’m not the type to tell the world, feel like I can get by without them realizing it"
175906870,Wow. Just getting opportunity after opportunity. Got 2 today.
174330528,This site is very pro drugs. Im just warning you guys that negative sides of schizo aren’t thing. It is caused by the drugs. The drugs cures the positives and as a side effect causes the negatives
175906871,I am pretty sure that people suffering with a bipolar type disorder don’t tolerate antidepressants well. I’m not denying that I suffer with bipolar symptoms but I also suffer with schizophrenia symptoms as well. I too lack motivation and feel like blah throughout the days.
175906872,I knew that God loved me. And I was taught the golden rule once. My family never went to church. I knew nothing else.
175906873,Taught a class today. Just feel more productive in general. My depression has lifted significantly.
175906874,"Didn’t feel aroused Her body felt like warm flesh. Like chicken from the supermarket. I will never watch porn or masturbate again. I will never pursue a girlfriend. I will never get married. Never have kids. You are all Reptilians from another consciousness and you have me trapped in a human body, a slave to my human biology. I am the light, sound and heat of the Universe. You are the darkness, silence and cold. When I become God again I shall not be benevolent. I will torture you all. You shall be punished by the right hand of God (me). I am God."
175906875,Oh ok that’s cool. I hope things are better for you now. Are you on disability?
175906876,"I'm going to try to drink more water. I have a list of 63 goals in my planner, the list goes up to 100. Most of them are small things like read a certain series, wear sunscreen, get a dental exam, try new recipes, etc but a few are larger like go back to college and finish getting my associates degree. I won't accomplish everything in the next year but I hope I can get a lot of it done. I'll just keep working on it for years to come if not"
175906877,Being natural is the most healthiest things to do.Plus healthy natural diet and active lifestyle…who needs med?

175906881,"I keep trying to get myself to work out, but I’m not doing it. I’m eating too much also. I’ve been eating a lot of peanut butter and syrup because it keeps me regular, but it packs on the weight. I might switch to bulk fiber laxative, but not even that works as well as peanut butter and syrup. My belly is huge, though."
175906882,"I work and think it is overrated. Yes, I earn money but not much. But, if you really want to work and can, you should. It keeps me busy and pays the bills. I think work is good for one’s self-esteem but stressful at times. Also, the type of work you do matters. If you are doing landscaping or gardening, you might like it. Being outdoors and with nature is sometimes a stress-reliever. But, it you are doing work indoors and are cooped inside like a chicken, it might be stressful and unenjoyable. If you are receiving disability benefits, you can work part-time to a limit. This might be good for you to get out and meet others. But, if you aren’t able to do this, I would be happy just being on benefits and pursuing your hobbies."
175906883,Well I guess I’ll give it the month and try that amyloban next if it doesn’t work for me.

175906886,I don’t feel like going to work. Should I lie and call in sick and stay home and surf YouTube all day?
175906887,Someone i know loves it. I hated it. People are too different to say much.
175906888,Thankfully no. I would hate to have someone else decide what I do with my money and give “permission “ to what I’m aloud to spend on. I pay all my bills etc so I’m responsible enough. I don’t have money saved up though. Only for my rego and insurance that needs to be paid yearly and a couple hundred if my horse or dog need the vet to bad if they need surgery cause I can’t afford it. I love planning my finances for each fortnight etc I can’t afford a holiday overseas with my boyfriend either plus I’m scared of getting psychotic. This fortnight coming I hope to put aside for my car rego and insurance and also try saving for a facial treatment. I want to save up for my boyfriends birthday in October too. I want to give him $350 if I can otherwise $100 gold class movie voucher. My friend is in debt and has a person decide what he is aloud to spend money on. He smokes too. I bought him a t shirt he loves and wears. Sucks that he is in debt. He deserves a better life and I hope things will 
get better for him soon.

175906890,I waited outside my house for ownie to collect me so I could join the PIRA he never came
174330520,Oh no _AT_MENTION_! Please do not do such thing! There are other avenues you can take to start removing the _USER_ID_ of schizophrenia. Dying for the cause will not change as many minds as you might think. Being alive and being able to show that you’re able to lead as close to a normal life as you can is a far better statement. Please think this over again. You’re a lovely person and would be a shame to lose.
175906891,Lobotomy…
175906892,The feeling is the same with me.
175906893,It probably means your brain is picking up on your fear of that happening.

175906895,I suspect that may be more stress related with all of the coronavirus worries and stuff. Some of the memory issues you mention could be age related or could be early signs of dementia. It’s difficult to tell.
175906896,Lol yeah I hear you!
175906897,hope the move goes well!
175906898,Red dead redemption 2 I mean I out on gamepass.
175906899,I used to take 5mg earlier but I reduced it to 2.5 as it didn’t do much and I am not a fan of taking psychiatric medicines without any significant benefits.
175906900,I had thinking problems taking xanax at anytime. It was like there was a block on my thoughts. I tried imagining what I would say for a job interview and figured I would do better to ask for a beta blocker. It never went away but it was a prn.
175906901,I don't have confidence in the kitchen unless it involves baking something
175906902,I went to the dr. this morning about my Sore Throat he thinks it might be the Buspar but wants me to contact my psychiatrist and let them know That I am having a sore throat as a side effect. So Looks like I may have to stop taking the Buspar and see what happens after two weeks of not taking it to see if my sore throat goes away if it does I wont have to go back to my family Dr. and if its stills sore I will have to go back after two weeks enough time to get the Buspar out of my system.
175906903,"Hugs, 12!!"
175906904,Yes but not by choice. Id much rather see a therapist.

My advice is to come up with some good questions for your pdoc; otherwise they’ll just keeping switching APs and their dosages. Participate in the group therapy’s they have to offer. This will help you a lot in the long run.

175906949,I can’t tell you it’s a bad idea. I’m kinda sorta eating frozen _NAME_’s right now.
174330538,"I started in May. Dropped too quickly. It was rough, but manageable. 234 mg paliperidone palmitrex to 175 to 156 to 3 mg risperidone over the course of May, June, and July. In August things finally evened out and I noticed I was actually functioning better on 3 mg than the max dose of the injection. Well now I’m in college, and I started dropping it again, and my therapist is finding me a doctor tomorrow so I can have a professional monitor it because I no longer am able to see the doctor who I collaborated with to create the plan. The new doctor at my home town ordered 3 mg risperidone pills so that has made tapering difficult and I will have to get 1 mg and 0.5 mg next with the new prescriber or ask the pharmacy. Right now I am taking 3/4 of the pill, or 2.25 mg. Yesterday and today was challenging. I didn’t have any symptoms, but it’s like I have to relearn how to manage my emotions. Not as bad as dropping from ~4 to 3. I am struggling a bit academically, but I’m pretty confident my brai
n chemistry will all even out after about 2 weeks. It feels very manageable but I’ve just been having to practice lots of prayer and meditation and mindfulness in order to make it to class and get work done. Old pains such as family trauma crept up on me today for no good reason and I cried for the first time in about a month and only felt better after reading some poetry. Now it’s all about being present, sitting with pain and negative emotions, and trying to learn from it. I’m taking the no voices as a good sign that this is not too quick. Essentially the plan is 25% drop each MONTH, because that is the optimum amount of the me for me to recover between drops I’ve found, and once I hit next month, I’ll have reached a half-way point of 1.5 mg. Then, all the guides I’ve read have said to drop 25% (at most, but it feels doable to me) from the PREVIOUS month’s dose when you reach half way. There’s a big difference. So basically this taper plan is estimated to last about a year, and I am already 
a couple months in. I plan to stay on the minimum possible dose for over a month during the last phase and cease the medication completely on May 9th because May 10th has special significance to me. I’ve found it’s really important to stay grounded. And it’s good that I have the support of my therapist and I can always call my previous doctor if I need to, but I am going to find a new doctor here. What do you guys think are important tips? How would you guys stay grounded? Have you ever done something like this? I’d also like to here your thoughts on whether a medication-free life for a schizophrenic is possible. The best research I’ve found has pointed to chronicity of illness being related to our lifetime use of medication, so while I view the meds as definitely having helped me, I don’t buy into the idea that I need to be on them for life, and I feel as if I’ve reached a point in my healing that I no longer need medication."

Before I met him I believed in god and prayed but had more beliefs similar to _PERSON_. I was christened a few years ago but have had difficulties becoming Christian because I don’t want to believe in hell because I think god is more understanding and forgiving and would not allow such a cruel thing. I believe a bit and want to believe as my boyfriend. To be united in sacred union with him. I kind of believe. I love god but was never a member of any religion mostly. I don’t want to be a pushover with any of my friends and I don’t actually think I am but I only have friends in spirit as such.

175906969,Could be anxiety or paranoia or both. It’s hard to overcome that overthinking but meds do help somewhat. Bring it up with your doctor. Biggest problem I found was that if you don’t hear voices there’s little to report back to your shrink which is hard if your struggling. Paranoia can be so subtle. I always get bogged down in what are you saying? Why do you say it like that? …Just from my experience.

I like to write and as I began to think more clearly I actually became a much better writer, and even managed to write a book (something I could have never of done before meds).

175907022,"In 2000, I decided to seek treatment for psychiatric issues for the first time. By 2005, I had been working with the same therapist and psychiatrist since 2002. And during those three years, I had made some progress with my problems. However, I hadn't made as much progress as I wanted. I was still feeling depressed at times. Also, my anxieties at the time were still a real problem for me. I wasn't satisfied with how far I had gone. I wanted more. The therapist and psychiatrist I was seeing back then kept reminding me to think about and appreciate how much progress I had made, and how much better I had gotten since going into treatment in 2000. It was true that I had gotten better. But it wasn't enough for me. Finally, I elected to work with new psychiatrists and a new therapist. I got on new medication that worked better for me for me as a result. And the counselor, an EMDR-trained therapist, was a better fit for me. I got even better because of it. Looking back, if I had settled with only partial 
success, I wouldn't be as well as I am now. If I hadn't gotten new providers, I wouldn't be where I am today. So if you've been in treatment for psychiatric issues and haven't made as much progress as you would like, maybe you can do something about it like I did. Maybe settling for partial success is a mistake for you. I'm glad I didn't settle!"

I'm _NAME_. That's my username. It's also my name. ""You're off to a great start, _NAME_, keep going!"" Lo and behold, I'm not diagnosed with Schizoid PD. I have a good experience dealing with Schizoids, or should I say a Schizoid. My ex boyfriend of five years had the diagnosis, and then said heck all to his psychiatrist and therapist and stopped seeing them. He was happy, so I was happy for him. That wasn't even a year into our relationship. We lived together for a while, we did things together, he came into the bakery I work at and bought some doughnuts while I was there and we stood around and talked while I goofed off like I do daily, we did everything together. Then, suddenly, I stopped mattering to him. The only thing that mattered to him were his video games, his anime, and not being bothered 
at any point of the day. He refused to get a job, and in turn, he had no health insurance, and he dropped out of college. He had (and probably still has) thousands of dollars in medical bills. In the final year, I was paying these bills, plus the bills of our home, plus his cell phone bill, plus paying for everything. After I told him that I was done paying his bills, he moved out, but said that he still wanted to talk. It wasn't much later that I cut off ties with him completely. That's my experience with a single Schizoid. I also talk daily to former Schizoid PD forum mod _PERSON_. We talk all the time. She's radically cool. So, yeah, that's an introduction I guess."

Finally I had enough and fired them, and started seeing my current pdoc, even though she doesn’t participate with any insurances and I have to pay for her out of pocket. She has me on the right cocktail, and I am nowhere near the max doses of the three meds I take (Zyprexa/Lamictal/Lexapro). So worth the change! Pdocs should ALWAYS listen to you!"

174330579,A true schizophrenia recovery would be if you were active in things rather than just being free of the voices. Having “not much to do” doesn’t sound like a true recovery to me. A good ending to a book from someone who has recovered would be the job you were doing or the marriage you were in. If all you are doing is sitting around wanting to write a book you are more susceptible to the Psych Ward than you think. I remember being in that position at 41 and I relapsed and I can’t say I ever truly recovered. My book I was going to write was “Ravings of a Lunatic” which since has been taken as a title. I quit writing it when I discovered how expensive the self-publishing business was and how at odds the local publishing businesses were to my beliefs at the time. It’s harder than you think.
175907101,"Since you’re a Star Wars fan which do you prefer the rebels or the imperial forces?

Nine total. Some people would rather follow the law than do what’s objectively right. Some people follow their own moral code above that of the law. While there can be alignment there is often conflict even between these two types of good. It’s something fun you can talk to people about without them realizing your performing an analysis on them. Lots of people here were pure neutral. I’m generally neutral good, thus I follow my own code of good even if I had to break a law to do it, at least in theory. Still I’ve noticed at work I’m lawful good. Sometimes I have to do hard things, but it’s important to follow the rules of the team."

However make sure you have the required papers to qualify for the job.

175907126,"True. Sometimes I feel my condition would have been very different if only I had learnt to laugh at myself. But certain character traits cannot be wished away. Often I tend to blame my upbringing but it is really a failure to come to grips with the situation. Life is not meant to be taken too seriously. People that tend to flow with the tide often tend to be happier persons too. At times, LIFE can suck."

If you search on youtube for “Schizophrenia and smoking” the first video that comes up, takes a position that the biggest cause of (smoking) is boredom. That felt new to me.

175907140,"Seems like republicans are the entitled ones. I'd never understood the dirt poor republicans... especially those who get benefits from the government. They always seem to think other people are leaching off the government and they're the only ones who are struggling... especially ones who barely fall fall above poverty line and cannot receive benefits and struggle to get food in the house. My dad for instance... he's the only one who works and lives in a two bedroom apartment who my pregnant sister, my dads bff/pregnant daughters boyfriend, 9 year old niece, youngest brother, and my stepmom live. They resort to selling their pain pills to my pregnant sister and other folks to get a little extra money. Yet he supports republican ideas and people like _PERSON_. He's under the impression that illegal immigration is a problem and they're the ones who are actually ""leaching off the government."" Hello, illegals cannot receive benefits.

He yelled, ""********, i heard it with my own ears on the news"" and that he see's stuff differently than me because he was in the military... I yelled back that I didn't want to talk about it with him. He told me not to yell at him he's my dad. I said for him to go **** himself (he was never a dad to me). I walked out of the car in the middle of traffic and he drove off. Haven't talked to him since then. Which is fine because my mom put the guilt trip on him about how when my mom talks trash about him I'm always defending him. I doubt he's losing sleep over it but I hope he does."

175907142,"I've been avoiding talking to people in my real life this last week; a few friends have sent me messages and I've not even opened them because they'll lead to conversation which feels too draining. I'm also not sure why it would be draining especially since I really enjoy talking to one of them who I recently reconnected with and seems a bit like family. I may offend her the longer she thinks I'm ignoring her. I get offended when people do it to me. I don't understand why, except for very rare exceptions, it seems like too much effort to maintain ""normal"" contacts the way most people do. People tend to get fed up with me because of this and lose the desire to be friends. Apologies and excuses for repeatedly avoiding people only go so far."

175907147,"It’s a fine line indeed. I still feel guilty about not practicing though. My faith used to be a big part of my life, and it was suddenly ripped away from me. The voices seem to get worse whenever I attend services. And my not so stable brain tended to go straight to thoughts of possession, so I decided to stop practicing so my delusions wouldn’t get worse. Just a tough situation, and hopefully after I leave this world my reasoning will be understood."
175907148,Awhile ago I sat down hard on the floor without actually falling and my butt is soooo sore. But about all I can do is keep on walking. I wish I had that extra fat today. Not fun to be slim and unpadded.

That is why I'm trying to be more independent, getting a job and such. Grad school helps in the long term for job prospects. Not in the short-term though.

174330589,"Critics argue that the definition of SPD is flawed due to cultural bias and that it does not constitute a mental disorder but simply an avoidant attachment style requiring more distant emotional proximity. [10] [11] If that is true, then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in social situations may be partly accounted for by the judgments commonly imposed on people with this style. However, impairment is mandatory for any behaviour to be diagnosed as a personality disorder . SPD seems to satisfy this criterion because it is linked to negative outcomes. These include a significantly compromised quality of life , reduced overall functioning even after 15 years, and one of the lowest levels of “life success” of all personality disorders (measured as “status, wealth, and successful relationships”). [12] [13] [14] Symptoms of SPD are also a risk factor for more severe suicidal behaviour . [15] en.wikipedia.org Schizoid personality disorder Schizoid personality disorder (
/?sk?ts??d, ?sk?dz??d/, often abbreviated as SPD or SzPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment, and apathy.

175907193,When I was in the hospital I had severe psychosis. They gave me an injection of haldol and it brought me out of it fast. One side effect of haldol is acne. If you have acne it will make it worse. Haldol is an old drug developed in the 1950’s. The reason they still use it is because it’s effective and cheap. I wouldn’t advise staying on it too long. It has some really nasty side effects. There are better meds on the market. I’m schizoeffective and I’ve been on Zyprexa/Olanzapine since 1997. I quit taking haldol when I got out of the hospital and switched to Zyprexa. I’m not saying what worked for me would work for everybody it’s just my own personal experience with haldol.

175907197,Medications can be really helpful to calm you some while you do the hard work in therapy to learn coping skills and how to manage your anxiety. I agree w the other person that breathing exercises can be really helpful. The hard part is remembering to do them at the right time so you can feel better and get back in the present moment.

174330592,"hey _AT_MENTION_ I haven’t been on the forum long so I don’t know your history but from what I see, neighbours seems to be a repeat, horrid trigger for you. You deserve better. I think you should move. Do your have a Housing Worker or Support Officer who can help you apply for alternative housing? I used to be a Housing Support Worker and the waiting lists were huge so I know that where I live, the sooner you apply, the sooner you may be able to move somewhere else peaceful. I love living on my own but, in close quarters, one neighbour drives me nuts as she leaves her 2 cats out all night & they kill wildlife (which is illegal, you’re supposed to have your cats confined inside by sun-down) and are always on the look-out to beat the living ???? out of my cat which means vet, psychotic symptoms triggered & vet bills $$. You can fight for better accommodation. It may be a long wait but at least start the process of acquiring better public housing by lodging an application with a housing worker. 
In my experience, neighbours can be heaven or hell… the noise thru open windows, the looks as your trying to get to your private apartment, the noise, the noise, the noise, the noise thru the walls - it’s hell to a sz & not right. You gotta take action & fight. Don’t know where you live but in my part of the world it’s a long fight. Start as soon as you’re able to."

175907205,"One of my biggest coincidences/delusions(?) is the case of numbers 3, 6, 9. I might think that Tesla’s If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe refer to me. But now I may think that it is not associated to me, but refers to sums of consecutive digits: (0+)1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36, 3+6 = 9 (terms/addends/summands are 3 and 6 and the sum is 9 ) (0+)1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45 (4+5 = 9 , the same sum, also 9 ) in addition, 0+9 = 9 , 1+8 = 9 , 2+7 = 9 , 3+6 = 9 , 4+5 = 9 . It appears that Tesla’s sentence about 3, 6, 9 may have something to do with sums above. Or maybe Tesla’s 3, 6, 9 has something to do with sums of digits in natural powers of number 2? 2^0 = 1 2^1 = 2 2^2 = 4 2^3 = 8 2^4 = 16, 1+6 = 7 2^5 = 32, 3+2 = 5 2^6 = 64, 6+4 = 10 Sums of digits are numbers from 1 to 10, but there is no 3, 6, 9. I think that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36 is better explanation than powers of 2 mentioned above because it is associated with number with digits 3 and 6 wh
ich has sum of digits 9 and product of digits 18 (which equals 3+6+9). 3, 6, 9 has interesting property: product of two smallest members of that arithmetic sequence is the same as sum of numbers forming that sequence: 3x6 = 18 = 3+6+9 . It may be only non-constant arithmetic sequence having that property! Last time I found new dependencies associated with 3, 6, 9 which are pretty large. So I might have ideas that 3, 6, 9 has reference to me, but I think that these ideas are symptoms of mental illness and are false."
175907206,God bless you I hope you find the right meds stay strong you’ll find something that works

But how/why would that help reduce cravings for nicotine? It would be expected to do the opposite, because it would “simulate” a lowering of acetylcholine levels at nicotinic synapses. I suppose it is possible that it might actually increase acetylcholine release by blocking presynaptic nicotinic autoreceptors, but I can’t find any studies exploring that hypothesis. All in all, I’m still inclined to think is the dopaminergic effect that does it. -A."

175907243,"It has been about 17 years since my first psychotic episode, and I was 16/17 when it took place. I wasn’t diagnosed as SZ then as my key worker convinced the psychiatrist that it was drug induced. I remained on AP’s until I was 19, and then didn’t have another episode until I was 23, and that’s when they Dx’d me with SZ. What was your story of onset? Did they hold back on the SZ label for you initially?"

I have them use the trimmer on it #5 for the sides and #8 for the top. Easy to explain and easy to care for. I don’t know anyone else that does this but it works for me
175907270,_AT_MENTION_. I think what naturallycured said is worth a try. I’m not by any means saying to drop your doctor or not to stop taking conventional medicine. I’m just saying that it wouldn’t hurt you to try other things as well. Try to focus on things you enjoy. For example I love a cup of hot tea on a cold morning. It’s simple but I’m so grateful I can afford to buy tea.

It is your choice whether or not to continue to endure this behavior. Maybe you should move out for awhile. Feel what it is like to live without the chaos and drama for a bit.

175907300,Is psychosis a natural process of psychological growth. Of bringing forth unconscious fears and desires in order to become whole.
174330616,I guess I might have Schizophrenia and _PERSON_’s. I think _PERSON_’s is more stigmatized amongst women. Thank God my _PERSON_’s is very mild to a point where doctors constantly disagree and it has been removed from the latest DSM. You’re born with _PERSON_’s but not schizophrenia. I would rather have _PERSON_’s any day (a mild case) than have schizophrenia. Having both sucks but it could be a blessing in disguise. I’m one of the few schizophrenics that don’t hallcuinate at all but I tend to think very deeply which worsens my delusions and I obsess about my thoughts and delusions too. I used to be very logical to a fault. I think AIDS/HIV is the most stigmatized illness out there. I tend to avoid these people at the mental hospital.

The dermatologist, my PCP, the dentist, blood tests, getting scanned, the podiatrist, my psychiatrist, the kidney specialist. I had biopsy’s, a colonoscopy, etc. It sucked, I was always making phone calls to doctors and driving to different hospitals in different cities. I know many people on here have way worse health problems than me but I was just getting so discouraged. Then in 2020 things slowed down. It was such a relief. I could relax. But in late 2020, and now early 2021 things snuck up on me and now I’m having at least one appointment a week, sometimes more. I hope I don’t have another bad year of health problems."

Also I had visions where they torture terrorists which made me think that is where they wanted to take me. Also when I took too much adderall one of my raps mentioned _NAME_ somewhat disparagingly."

175907368,HA! I said the same thing SC. I was happy that I received an explanation though. Smoking would not have occurred to me as a reason for waking up so scared. I had never heard of it. I still roll my eyes when I think of that time. At least he always woke me up on the occasion that I was having a low glucose episode. That he understood.

175907369,"This rings true to me, the winner take all thing. If you’re down then the friends in your life are out, and if you’re doing well, then they flock to you, to raise them up. People are awfully selfish and throw you in the ditch if you become baggage. I don’t see any standout character in my own family that rises above this quality of human nature. I feel slighted most by the people I devoted myself to the most. My family. I sacrificed so much of my heart and soul to these people caring about their worries, and struggling to lighten the load of my mother’s burden and I feel like she’s emotionally cut me off. I’m another disappointment in her life that she’d rather not see."

175907436,"Well, _PERSON_ turned out to be a bust. What got me is that it is ony designed to be used on a single device. I tried to install it on my iPhone 11 from work so I wouldn’t have to carry two phones while out walking and it went kablooey. Half a week later their support department still couldn’t get it back to running right on my single device. They refunded all of my money. Their course seems mostly okay and I appreciate the psychology. The coaching is very limited, and the online groups they want you to use are just horrible. I didn’t use them, used a Facebook group dedicated to _PERSON_ instead. One for Canadians. That’s probably the part of the program I’ll miss most, hope I can find a comparable group. What I find funny about _PERSON_ is they constantly brag up how techy they are. They’re not. Their app is one of the worst designed and dodgiest in the diet industry. It’s so bad that rank incompetence is the only way to describe it. I think the service could be valuable if their tec
h worked, but it doesn’t work well at this time and that’s the main reason to give the service a pass. I did lose 12 lbs while on it, but I’m walking so much right now the odds are I would have lost it on a different program. My recommendation is to avoid _PERSON_ at this time, particuarly if you’re on a fixed income. _AT_MENTION_, you mentioned you’re using something new. Mind refreshing my memory?"

Within 6 months, my back pain was relieved, as long as I kept up my yoga practice. I now faithfully follow a beginner to intermediate yoga practice and I am fit and feel 30 years old again.

Keep trying for greatest function and live your life as large as you can.
175907452,Last year I had a health kick and stayed the same for a week before I started to lose weight. That is why this time I didn’t weigh myself for nearly two weeks. It is silly measuring yourself every day. Daily fluctuations can be around 2lb for some people. Once or fortnightly weighing is the best way to measure to see a difference. First weeks are often misleading as the body adjusts to gaining muscle and losing fat adjustments. That was certainly the case for me.
175907453,Don’t start using again. The escapism you’re thinking of is probably just a subtle desire to self destruct. Don’t give into it. You’re an inspiration to many here.

175907455,what a load of bollocks
175907456,"Mad world84. It’s good to know you are positive. I wasn’t for many years and I worry. You said when you moved into your parents home that, “Nothing is aligned properly and isn’t symmetrical, it causes huge stress and anxiety. I feel uneasy and can’t relax.” And you wrote into the anxiety forum, and said, ""I’ve recently seen a psychiatrist after 16 years of suffering all sorts of anxiety. I only saw her once and she mentioned sertraline I think it’s called, have no idea about it I’ve never taken anything, I didn’t talk to her about my living situation as I actually have worse things on top of that and that is what she thought might help... however I’m hesitant because of hearing about weight gain, just can’t seem to really win in life but I should be used to that by now!” On webmd.com, it said about Sertraline: ""Sertraline is used to treat depression, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and 
a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (premenstrual dysphoric disorder).This medication may improve your mood, sleep, appetite, and energy level and may help restore your interest in daily living. It may decrease fear, anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and the number of panic attacks. It may also reduce the urge to perform repeated tasks (compulsions such as hand-washing, counting, and checking) that interfere with daily living. Sertraline is known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It works by helping to restore the balance of a certain natural substance (serotonin) in the brain.” It does mention weigh gain as you say, but it sounds like it has a lot of benefits. You said, ““I’ve recently seen a psychiatrist after 16 years of suffering all sorts of anxiety.” It sounds like you waited a long time to get treatment. You said, “she thought might help... however I’m hesitant because of hearing about weight gain.” It’s very good that you went in for treatment. I think you’re one ste
p away from being there. I think you are working up a world of worry over a side effect. I know, they are bothersome, but I think you have to look at the overall picture. I think if there is a medicine that would help you with this, you should give it a try. That is my opinion. “You also said, “just can’t seem to really win in life but I should be used to that by now!” You might not win but you could come in a close second if you’ll take your medicine. Again, I think you are one step away from being there. I think your psychiatrist is absolutely right. I think you were very strong to get that psychiatrist. I would urge you to utilize her skills. I think the first thing you ought to do is pat yourself on the back."

175907477,are You on a AP? Do you do anything on the side Like smoke weed or drink alcohol or drugs? Also What do you eat in a daily basis? How much water do you drink in a daily basis And what kind of water And what do you do all day with your time Just curious…
174330658,No I think the pdoc is an idiot. He should just give mamcox a different med it’s basic logic. Obviously abilify doesn’t work on mamcox and the pdoc is too much of a dimwit to realize that. How did he become a pdoc if he’s such a retard wtf.

Or You don’t allow PMs. No matter which the case, they’re there. Take one or all three reasons there was no reply, I’m just saying this now in case it was number 3, and the friendly attempt was futile to begin with. You owe me no answer. You owe me no reasons.

175907522,"Psychiatric Times Schizophrenia in Later Life: Patient Characteristics and Treatment Strategies With the prevalence of schizophrenia in older adults set to double and reach 1.1 million people in the US by 2025, greater attention to research and policy regarding this population is needed. Positive and negative symptoms It has been commonly understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia decline in later life, while negative symptoms dominate the presentation in older age. However, findings from several studies have invalidated this notion. The International Study of Schizophrenia (ISoS) assessed 18 global cohorts over 15- and 25-year periods and found 77% of patients had no evidence of significant negative symptoms over the course of their illness.3 Similarly, a longitudinal study of institutionalized geriatric patients with schizophrenia showed no significant changes in negative symptoms over time.4 From a clinical perspective, negative symptoms do not dominate in older adults with schizophrenia 
and are often expressed in a similar magnitude seen in younger patients. According to that it niether gets worse nor gets better. At least for negative symptoms."

I’m okay doing that for people who need it though. I also feel very lucky to be able to draw decently enough to show them what I mean. I usually do that when I am having trouble. It makes a big difference in how well the information is received. That is, if you and the people you’re talking to don’t mind the awkward silence as it’s being drawn. That said I have trouble finding words that describe what I’m thinking in general. I have a feeling that may be part of my cognitive deficits. Sometime I just lose the ability to find words. Drawing it out works in this circumstance as well. I understand you can’t always being drawing your thoughts out when doing business though.

175907596,"I’m the same off medication _AT_MENTION_. No disembodied voices or delusions. I recently tapered off my meds all-together and what I noticed is that my anxiety increased to sheer terror. Constant terror. All I could do was sit on the sofa & bite my fingernails until they bled. On meds the anxiety decreases from terror to high anxiety. The psychotic symptoms continue exactly the same as if I’m not on meds. I can mask my psychotic symptoms & function in society (I have 2 jobs), I’m just careful not to talk out loud to myself in public so as to protect my reputation. When I go hike in the wilderness I talk out loud to myself all I want, it’s just the trees & the wind that see & hear me. Thanks for your reply. What are your symptoms _AT_MENTION_, are you able to work?"
175907597,I got the worse headaches in my life when I messed with my meds without telling my Dr. I also got brain zaps and tremors. I stopped my Risperdal abruptly in one night and took a full dose Latuda the same night. I wanted to go back on Latuda on my own. I ended up vomiting the Latuda as it usually causes me nausea. It was a mess and a mistake that could have sent me into full psychosis. I started having psychotic symptoms and had to increase my Risperdal on my own from 3 to 5mg for a few days to be stable then went back to 4mg and told my Dr. Now I take 4mg. I guess Drs taper meds for a good reason.

You are torn between knowing(!) that they are caused by anxiety and the possibility of them being really caused by an existing condition. Since this virus crisis started, I have been feeling many of the symptoms - even the shortness of breath for real. Just when I say ""oh finally I am at peace now, the symptom is over, I am free..."" BAM, a new one begins the next day. I am so freaking tired of it, almost thinking -Oh I be sick now and I don't care anymore, if its gonna help with the anxiety... I mean I have been through a lot in my life and I managed to overcome tough stuff, but this? It's so annoying. I recovered from Panic Disorder, punched it in the face twice. I do lots of self help but I can't do anything to help HA. Tsk... Hang in there all, I know you also go through the same thing I am most of the time. I hope we al

175907623,"Did voices come back? You were doing fine, I remember"
175907624,I wish I could believe that.
175907625,"I slept 8 hours without meds, 10-12 hours on Zyprexa and I sleep 9 hours on Seroquel."
175907626,"Just leave it a couple of days man - basically till there is no pain. You will be fine I reckon. Just keep an eye out for infection (pain, spreading redness, swollen)."
175907627,Ah lack of motivation… I know it well.
174330676,"“While cariprazine and risperidone were equally effective in controlling acute overall symptoms, only cariprazine improved predominant negative symptoms in acute patients. Furthermore, cariprazine is able to improve persistent primary negative symptoms. In fact, it was better than risperidone,” she added. Good news"
175907628,I downloaded an app called ACNH Guide for Animal Crossing to help keep track of things
175907629,"I quit it because i went through a phase that no meds was better. In denial i guess. And ive been doing this staring at a wall thing since november/december. Sometimes its due to obsessing over paranoid type toughts. Worrying if im on camera, and tell myself “ill show them, hows watching me do nothing muffukkas!”"
175907630,Maybe I should try ECT to see if it would help me. It could make me better. My mom is against it. It sounds scary though.
175907631,Good luck! 1515
175907632,Sounds like you will have to stick it out… doctors don’t take delusions lightly for safety of you and others.
175907633,In vancouver the cheapest homes are like 1.5 million lol
175907634,either try rtms.!!
175907635,About 2 years. But was heavily medicated during that and still somewhat symptomatic. But that’s the longest I’ve gone without needing to be hospitalized.
174330690,Never attended a medical in nearly 20 Years. I just gave the paperwork to my Social Worker and let him deal with it. Got a Clinical Letter sent to the DWP as well. Got put in the support catagory for PIP / ESA. As far as i know they wont bother me again - whether i improve or not. Theres no damn way im capable for work - im just glad i had the CMHT fighting my corner.
175907636,my day is going pretty good… watched movie and had good din dins and now i’m listening music and browsing the forum
174330684,I told him its the sz but he just says that its my fault. Maybe I should change him. I have an apt with him and the therapist at the same time 3 Dec.
175907637,"Yeah, I would have guessed that about you loving horror movies. It is probably a crutch to your delusional beliefs mixed with the cultish philosophy you read. _PERSON_ for szs to be honest. That stuff should be avoided by us as it feeds the madness in us all. Why don’t you read _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ instead?"
175907638,"Could be you just need some time to get used to invega. I had some side-effects when I started, and again when I had my dose upped, but they went away after a while."
175907639,"Why do they hurt? Maybe you are spending too much time in front of computers, mobile and tv? I try to limit my time on screens, it helps. Also I have blue light filters on all my devices."
175907640,You can always be quitted again. I would stay home so you don’t get in trouble. See you in awhile.
175907641,"Uh, here in California when I was 19 I applied for and got a full time job steam cleaning carpets in homes. If went with another worker to be trained for three days as we drove to homes all over this valley. The guy let me do most of the work which he shouldn’t have. After three days, we coincidentily had a meeting with all the other workers. I got fired in the meeting and some s*it happened. But anyways I worked my ass off for three days and didn’t get paid because it was “training”. Someone told me to call the Labor Board downtown and I learned that it is illegal to train someone without getting paid. The law is that an employee cannot be trained for no pay. A company has to pay someone when they are training them. We had a hearing at the Labor Board and I won and the carpet cleaning company had to pay me three days wages."
175907642,"I want you to like me, Even love me, But I can’t love you back. Is that ok ?"
175907643,"It probably was, and caused or made worse by stress. Is that what a tension head is???"
174330683,Good luck _AT_MENTION_ !
175907645,"Life is so much pressure. Between work, school, and dating I’m finding I need some sort of release. I don’t know what it is. There was something about my delusions that were freeing. It was like I understood the universe and it looked through me. I need to stop. I can’t put my family through any more turmoil"
175907646,yea sometimes it feels a bit like this it is really not a great approach to life. I have talk therapy this Saturday I will bring it up. thanks for sharing Chordy.

This is from the wiki: ""According to the DSM, those with SPD may often be unable to, or will rarely express aggressiveness or hostility, even when provoked directly."" Can you elaborate on what you imagine would happen if someone ###$ with this PD? I've been trying to think, if I would ever find myself in prison, what the reason would be.

175907652,I think my zoloft needs to be upped
175907653,Do people really tell you that “you’re a monster” and things like that…or is it just you that assumes people think these things of you?
175907654,I feel very nervous when i am in the society. Sometimes even when i am within my family i have jitters. For the fact that i have hurt them a lot. I lost the respect that once i had. Is it illusion or illness talking. I feel some spark would make me normal. Does anyone relate to me?
175907655,"Yes I did. I was suicidal the spring of 2019. Was feeling tired too, but thought that was due to the depression."

175907680,"I think I was stupid enough to lead people to my account on here. a) because my story was such a whopper, and b) because I've not been clever enough, I didnt take proper steps to insulate myself. Everyone else is safe, just not me. I remember one of my first posts. I gave my full name because I meant to address it to my school. I don't think I gave the school name though. That post has been gone for 5 years I believe. But when I googled my name to make sure I can't be linked to this or that, a simple google of my name with my condition lead them to that address (letter to the school). What's even more foolish was that I used a small image of myself, which when using google image search, led straight here, and I used that image on facebook and my dating profile. So i burnt that account, deleted all photos of me on this site, and created a new account to start fresh, and ever since I've been tidy, but how long does it take to look at my posts and see a person with my interests, struggles, and my conc
erns? I'm a fool. I just hope that this handle is clean, but when I look at how people recognize me and react absurdly, I can only come to the conclusion that this handle is compromised as well. I have a list of facts that can vaguely come to this conclusion, but I have no hard facts no hard confirmations."
175907681,Whens _NAME_ getting his coffee maker LOL
175907682,"I’m not sure. I think of certain things I’ve experienced as delusions sometimes. It’s easier to go on with life thinking it couldn’t have been true. There are some major cornerstones to the experiences which I can’t pretend didn’t happen… meh. So basically I feel most of my experiences really did happen. I can empathise with those who describe things they are experiencing (as delusions). But some of the delusions here, just sound like delusions."
175907683,"On 12-2-2019, you said, ""I am in stressful situation my anxiety is through the roof."" Today, 1-19-2021, you say, ""do have a therapist and will be calling her again and (I'm taking) Cipralex."" (it was termed Escitalopram previously). Earlier today you posted, ""Abit about myself just incase those who don't know me. I have been suffering with anxiety for over 30 + years."" So, putting that together, I'm wondering, ""Why in over a year, does she still have anxiety? How long has she been on her current medicine, Cipralex/Escitalopram? Wonder why the anxiety has not improved in over a year?"" Net says Cipralex/Escitalopram treats long term depression and anxiety and OCD. Why isn't it working? But you're right, those were past posts which dealt with anxiety. Today's original post was completely different, it's mainly: ""The newest symptom i have been getting from 3 years ago which it stopped and returned full force the last couple of months. I can hear my heart beating in my ear and head it is very c
lear and sounds like my heart beat. When this happens my ear plug up and i feel horrible head pressure that i cannot not move. I feel like I'm going to loose consciousness. its a very scary feeling. Like I'm stuck in my body and can come out of it until i calm down. I have been taking clonazepam half of it when it happens and after 10 mins i start to feel a bit normal again."" Well if what the net says is a benzo, short term tranquilizer, Clonazepam, stops the situation, maybe it's connected to your anxiety. I take a benzo tranquilizer, Ativan, when I have severe enough chest pain, and it stops the chest pain. So I know that can happen. But they found some difficulty in my heart area. You don't test for any physical problem. So maybe that leaves anxiety. So I'm wondering, is your medicine working?"
175907684,"It gets easier as you get older, I would say, and I know you are at least a few years younger than me (I’m 40), so maybe you’ll get there naturally over the next few years."

175907687,I always remember atmospheres from several years at a time …
175907688,i think that people want to get rid of people like me anyway
175907689,Think I seem quite normal. Been hired twice since becoming sick. I’ve quit due to new job first time and second time cause of the sickness.
175907690,If it is my physcosis symptoms or is it really real I think it’s real and i feel nerve pain. The pain feels like a pump like the heart…its kinda _NAME_ pain. Anyone had this experince? I dont want the doctors to think im crazy? Note: when I went to my dentist they said my teeths were okay. But I told them that every time I bite something I feel a sharp nerve pain inside my tooth (inside jaw?)
175907691,I’ve given up on tmg. Maybe it just doesn’t mix with abilify…
174330692,15mg was a nightmare. 5mg I can actually do some things but I struggle due to energy and motivation. My energy and motivation doesn’t allow me to jog even on 5mg
175907692,"Nice, _AT_MENTION_ ! Keep up the good work!"
175907693,"I quit gradually after having smoked heavily for over 50 years. First, I cut it down to 5 cigarettes a day. After a few months, I cut it down to 4, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 1/2 and finally just a few puffs until the day it dawned on me that it was time to really quit. It was no big deal after getting it down to a few puffs of one a day. That will be 4 years ago in October."

174330689,"Ive always been a bit of a nut, the quiet one, the one with a few screws loose in the family. It wasent until i got doxxed and stalked from people online, that i went completely crazy. I think it was the feeling of being completely vulnerable that did it to me. Thinking i was safe online and such. Now i get that voice too where i’m like, maybe the people at schizophrenia.com are coming to get me or pelt my house with eggs or just the most morbid things. Also reddit, 4chan and some other forums i visit. But after my whole ordeal, the people stalking me were actually friendly and curious. They wanted me to see a doctor, i think, because i was posting some of the most insane stuff online. I completely lost touch with reality like 2 years ago and thought that everything i typed had some effect on the stuff irl. I also gained this weird power where i could literally feel peoples emotions in their writings, and i would search up the psychology of the emotion and try fix it. It was interesting to say th

I’m currently looking at Boron supplementation, 6 to 10 mg a day seems like it would be ideal. This is a double blind study showing low level Boron being 50% effective at relieving arthritis pain than placebo with 10%: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232071985_Boron_and_Arthritis_The_Results_of_a_Double-blind_Pilot_Study Supposedly Jamaica has next to no Boron in their soil, and their arthritis rate is around 5%.

174330697,"Thanks ninjastar, I’ll bear that in mind, it is a good idea. What I want to do is stay focused on recovering from my condition which is why this forum is good. The off topic posts are more to do with what I think is required by others, which is very arrogant of me. I used to be on another forum and eventually got booted off for doing the same thing. I think I could go back to it now, but to be honest, I think it would only trigger me again. Not everything revolves around me, but at least schizophrenia.com deals with the issue of schizophrenia, not politics. I might change my mind though, do people think I am capable of rational political discussion?"

And I still believe I can get a good job one day not just a minimum wage one. It just takes time. They may have qualities I don’t have but I have qualities they don’t have likewise for you. I tell myself I’m doing really well maintaining myself which is what MY purpose is atm. Considering my circumstances. They are completely different circumstances to me. So that’s why they are doing different things to me. But yea it pisses me off having psychosis cos can’t take on a lot of stress. Or risks. The one thing that saddens, me is that I can’t support my family much in any sort of way. Whereas they can. But that will change at a further stage down my recovery road journey. Especially my dad he works a lot for his age. How’s the 
job going?"
174330694,Doc thinks it’s severe anxiety. She seemed agitated so I didn’t say “I think I’m schizophrenic” I just described what I experience and she didn’t seem too concerned. Gave me Xanax. I don’t know what I am experiencing now. Left with more questions. I don’t hear external voices nor do I have delusions about people out to get me or anything. Idk I could be withdrawing from a month of Clonazepam after the first episode. Now I have its more addictive little brother. Going to look for a specialist after I get insurance this month.

I feel less like people can see what I’m doing when I write in a dark room, so I write on my laptop at night in the dark because for some reason I feel safer. I also listen to music at a low volume, which helps to shut out voices. I hope your novel goes well! You ought to share it with us when it’s out"

175907735,"I woke up this morning, and realised I need to be here. The forum has been such an important thing for so long, I don’t think I can go without the interaction and support from all who’re here. To be honest, I got a bit overwhelmed last night, and my go to response is to shut down everything. I nearly even came off Facebook too, as I was getting so stressed. If I was mean to anybody yesterday, I am sorry. My only intention is to help make this a better place for others, but sometimes I don’t get it right. It’s confusing to me at times dealing with others, and unfortunately my anti-psychotic medication is starting to not control my symptoms as well as it has done in the past, and this is very concerning as there are not many left in the UK I can choose from that have an acceptable side effect profile for me. I am super worried, as my pdoc can take away my drivers license as they did before, and without that I have no income. Also, I divulged some information on here about my personal history 
that made me incredibly uncomfortable, and the voices have been torturing me about it ever since, and it has stirred up a lot of negative emotion that I thought had been dealt with. Overall, I hope others can understand why I sometimes choose to close the door on either my treatment providers, and on occasion, my forum/social media presence. I can help people where possible, on the main forum, but I have some limitations at times. This place seems to have a great level of acceptance for people, which is something I don’t get IRL. I’d like to think there is more understanding here, as IRL, I struggle so badly with my dealings with other people. I lack fundamental understandings, and since my ASD diagnosis in May - as _AT_MENTION_ pointed out a while ago, the awareness of ASD has really brought me down massively in confidence. The main problem is now I am conscious of my faults that come with this set of difficulties, and I get so drained so quickly these days. Thanks for reading. I hope others can understa
nd that I do not mean any harm to anybody else. I want to stay, and I hope that’s ok."

This is significant because before meditation I was hospitalized six times and my life was a wreck. Of course it’s not just the meditation. I still take my meds and participate in psychotherapy. I don’t think meditation will ever completely replace these other therapies for me or for anyone else with serious bipolar disorder. But when I added meditation to these primary therapies I got better. I recently was interviewed by the International Bipolar Foundation in a webinar on meditation and mental illness. You can see that here . In that interview I describe how I use mediation to predict oncoming episodes of mania or depression, and how I’ve taught that skill to others who have achieved the same success at managing their own mental illness. This ability to predict moods adds to the mood leveling benefits of a

174330705,"my goal right now is just to be happy. my fantasy is getting an advanced degree. a top school would be nice but not a necessity. I don’t function well around others and people. i sometimes feel not all schools are equal like when it comes to academics. someitmes, being too hard is a drawback. not sure if being harder is always better. it’s like i went to a hard, good school and failed out at a hard major, but if went locally and picked an easier major at an easier school, i might have made it. i have no regrets. i always pushed myself in academics and in sports and exercise. i feel more equiped getting a phd now despite the loss in intelligence than before mainly because of the interest and motivational thoughts. i couldn’t do it though. i cant even finish a ba in math. i would do it online but havent found a decent school. math schools are lacking. its hard when you go to a school that is a top school and that picks the hardest books and hardest problems and then going to a ‘regular’ sch
ool and getting upset and discouraged. i also worry about getting a b or not finishing a community college class and failing because of that. i tried going back but never got past regristration. i also am concerned about losing benefits because its keeping my a live and the peace. i can’t make a buck if my life depended on it. i want to do engineering or computer science but math is also great. no point in doing a double major at my age and condition. i think computer science or ee/ce would have been better for me and i regret not majoring in engineering in hindsight. math is great for tutoring or making minimum wage and being able to think and reason. my proving skills were good despite my poor grades due to prodomal and developing schizophrenia in college. i had one therapist say i would have failed anyways if i never had schizophrenia. i had another therapist thought i was a liar because i told him i went to a good school lol. i’ll probably just end up buying books on amazon and reading them on kindle 
and teaching myself things and avoiding people in life for the rest of my life. maybe stay with my family at home. i have no reason to leave the house except for food. i do get bored and lonely though staying at home 24/7. the world is a dangerous place. just look at the news. i would be happy with a degree in computer engineering and stopping there or doing math and then getting a masters or phd. unfortunately the world isnt kind to people like me. once you start mentioning parallel universes or past lives or weird theories, they write you off, ignore you, and i’ve probably burned many bridges with people."

In all honesty schizoaffective disorder is a perplexing diagnosis to have. I mean you either have schizophrenia or bipolar. Mood shifts can be seen with schizophrenia also.

174330707,"The first time I was put on Abilify was because the injections were court ordered cuz I had OD’d twice on my Seroquel. They put me on the Abilify plus Haldol injections. Then in December they put me on oral Thorazine. Then in April they switched me to Zyprexa but I quit taking it cuz it caused me to gain a huge amount of weight. So now I’m on the oral Abilify. I don’t worry too much when they switch meds anymore, as I don’t typically experience too many side effects. Also, I pretty much just do what they say now because I don’t want to be court ordered to get shots again. Because of my history of OD’ing, they only give me a week’s supply at a time, so I have to go in and see the nurse every week and she pretty much monitors their effects. My main motivation for taking meds is staying out of the hospital. I wish I could say it was something lofty like good insight, but it’s just maintaining my freedom."

174330738,For some there’s more of of a difference between before severe mental illness and after severe mental illness has developed compared to others. There wasn’t that huge gulf for me.

174330736,"The “gold standard” AP is clozapine. It is the go to med doctors use when a pt shows a lot of med resistance and nothing seems to be working for them. It works for like 90 something percent of cases. But it has some serious side effects. In general the “pips” and “rips” ie aripiprazole (what you are on) are the weakest of the antipsychotics but also are generally found to have the least side effects. The “dones” ie risperidone are the next step up in effectiveness and have some more side effects. The “pines” ie quetiapine are the strongest of the APs with the most side effects. So don’t lose hope if abilify isn’t strong enough for you, you still have a number of options left to you."

174330742,"It hit me the last time I went to check in to a mental hospital. I had one of my lucid windows of time where I realized something wasn’t right with me. I had struggled with bipolar for years and it occurred to me that the episodes were still coming despite medications, and the psychosis was getting so much worse Everytime. I remember breaking down crying to the person interviewing me at the intake. I told her briefly about my symptoms before falling into it again. Then I tried to get out, did successfully for a minute to talk to my husband with our children in the waiting room. I thought I’d be able to go home and that I was going to be fine after all. It was so hard on my husband and 3yr old. Next thing I remember I was back in, tried to barge in on the staff discussing me and got locked in a room. Don’t really remember transitioning from there to where I was transported except that I noted the garden we walked through to get there ( I had remembered smelling flowers the last time I went the
re by ambulance.) And then getting in trouble for lighting up in a nonsmoking ward. ( I don’t know why I lied to them about smoking, I was paranoid.) I remember getting to the right place but then it gets kind of choppy. I couldn’t talk for at least 24hrs and thought I could talk telepathically. I thought dreams were awake time. I spiralled off into so many directions I can’t list them all, layer upon layer of conspiracy theories, misinterpreted surroundings like thinking I had caused the burn victim night nurses scars. She nearly cried when I apologized. I ended up getting transferred to a state hospital because I had no insurance and was sooo bad. I mean in terms of being deep in psychosis, positive negative and cognitive issues all at once. I’ve always wondered how I can remember so much objectively when I come out of it. I mean even as I’m still struggling with it I start peicing it together. So many memories I wish I could share. I’m just relieved to be on this site now with people who unders
tand, ive been so lonely for that."
175907931,"That’s really horrible when a guy fixates on a woman like that and won’t take “no” for an answer. Can’t he just move on? There are plenty of women out there that might actually want to be around him. But, re. the topic, my paranoia and catastropic thinking manifests as being judged to go to heaven or hell with every little thought . It gets nauseating."
175907932,"This happened to a family member of mine. Wife cheated on him while he was overseas working. It had been a year long job with a month vacay and she had been excited for him to take it because the pay was excellent. He quit the job and came home. They were on the verge of divorce for well over a year. She moved out during that year. They went to marriage counseling, started attending church, and slowly gave their lives to God. She moved back in with him after a year and two more years passed with things rocky. Now, 7 years after the fact, they both testify they wouldn’t change a thing from that horrible nightmare. They both have grown a deeper love and respect for each other and have put the past in the past. I said all that to say don’t give up. I held my family member’s hand while he wept and literally had a nervous mental breakdown. We prayed and cried. He didn’t trust her and she didn’t think she could love him. Maybe try marriage counseling? Maybe try attending church together? It is 
devastating when your trust is broken in the one you have committed your life to. It is good she wants the marriage to work. But it sounds like you two have issues that still need to be worked out. try to have a forgiving and humble heart. And maybe both of you seek counseling. There are marriage seminars available. Sadly, I think they are now webinars, not weekend retreats. But those can be helpful. Prayers for you two."
175907933,"Just take one thing at a time. The holidays can be a tough time, so just focus on getting through that first. Don’t take on the whole future right now in this moment. What you picture can happen with your husband is the worst case scenario. There is very little chance something like that will happen so you should just dismiss that thought although it can be difficult. Sometimes when I think about stuff the worst case scenario pops up. I think it is quite common for people to have thoughts about that, but the healthy thing is to dismiss it. It’s like picturing you will win the first price in the lottery to compare it to a best case scenario. And yes, do get in touch with someone on a crisis line if things are too much to bear for you. I hope you will be able to calm down for the hollidays."

175907937,There is no such thing as luck. There is probability & statistics which is under the field of mathematics of how a certain event will occur. Your marriage hasn’t even lasted a year yet and you are considering leaving the marriage. I say continue on until your 1 year wedding anniversary and see how life with your wife is. Starting a family is good since a baby boy or girl will bring happiness to both your parents and wife’s parents.

So they’ve moved it up to next week. I haven’t had it in me to reach out to mom despite her having been one of my best friends. Everything feels so shallow and empty. Then I was absent for so long.

Or Look around the room for a certain color, say blue...just look at all the blue. This is up to you. For me, art therapy is the best. Another coping skills would be to put a sensory kit together, in that, softness soothes your anxiety. I am not good with this one. But some others could explain this better. It's hard to start, but eventually you will gain a better sense of what your feeling. What has your doctor told you about the medicine you are on? There is light at the end of the tunnel.

175907990,I remember the moment. About 1 month ago when suddenly my thoughts for as random as I intentionally produced them were being read out loud. I said to myself…“I have mental powers…how awesome” from that point forward I walk with much more confidence. I am no longer in the dark side of my mind and I tune in or out at will. My voices tell me many things and because I can communicate with them at will I dont even have to speak and such is the _USER_ID_ of war to obtain control over my own mind my choices and my freedom to think for myself. I learned to make them my friends my heroes my family my object of awe and I love them for they are hilarious and also insulting and also always on a party full of songs about their anti smoking campaigns in a plan to overall place a million dollars and a beautiful life if I stop smoking. However I intend to exercise my own thoughts through the milky way of what is mind mine. If you are experiencing the same then I advise you make them follow you. Make them la

175907998,That’s too bad you cared that much. I couldn’t afford going out with the man I met. Because I paid for more things and it ended up being too stressful.
175907999,"I have had times like that. I generally do that if I don’t feel like facing reality for the day. It’s easy to be too critical of ourselves, but the truth is that even when we don’t feel like trying any more it doesn’t mean we have no value. Society tends to make it seem like we should all have mansions and happy families and cars and etc, but this is all crap, what matters is in my opinion is what gives you peace with your existence because then you can be at peace with others."

Now _NAME_’s or _NAME_’s is a different story. I eat for comfort a lot too, and I’m a little chubby. All I can tell you is when I hit 30 it became almost impossible to lose weight. It’s so hard to eat healthier for me because I feel entitled to delicious food on account of how much I suffer. I hope things work out for you. I personally tried to reduce my portion size and eat slower, at the suggestion of a nutritionist at the vocational program I was in earlier this year. She said I was eating way too fast. Seems to help. I get the Junior burgers or kids meals sometimes if I do fast food. You’re definitely not a loser!"

174330755,I’m beginning to care less what ppl think of me and starting to open up about it. I just told my husband I have schizophrenia and we have been together for 8 years but I’m sure he knew? I kinda accused him of poisoning me several years ago and had to be hospitalized but I wasn’t really “aware”. I got better and didn’t bring it up much. Of course I admitted myself into the hospital that time too. I have relapsed a lot in life. Everytime I seem to get worse. I have been on everything under the sun it seems. I’m doing well on this medication now though. No side effects and I’m sleeping through the night finally. I haven’t slept in forever.
174330758,No effective medicine or treatment exist for chronic catatonia. Its almost like parkinson disease where dopamine neurons slowly get destroyed. Psych medicines like AP blocks dopamine further which makes catatonia worse. Benzos gives severe memory problems and mine memory already low this is why I going without medicines. Glad thing is I not have any positive symptoms yet so able to go without AP medicines which would have made my negative symptoms much worse.

I feel embarrassed to walk by them alone for some reason and always ask him to come with me to get things from the kitchen and whatnot. When he is at work during the day if they are there I feel too embarrassed to stay there usually it makes me feel like a bum. And I don’t like to make food in front of them because im worried they will judge me like think im messy or I eat too much or unhealthy. None of this is rational they are very nice people who have never said anything mean to me they are so sweet. But I just have anxiety about it. I want them to think well of me. I am constantly worried about being clean enough too, as cleaning is tough for me with my condition."

Then I light a weed joint and we smoke and forget about it. Only problem, short month later, I also hear a voice, only this voice is telling me to go speak to some buddy of mine… I ignore it. So the question is, maybe we both heard voice because of the weed we were smoking? or friend got infected with voice virus, came to my house, and infected me, thus me hearing voice like him? fast forward, I in uncle house and about to talk to uncle when I hear voice repeating in my head like full schizophrenic style saying same word over and over without stopping… while hearing voice, I put on serious face, and shortly after voice stops… I never hear from it again. Until one day, friend who came to my house with first voice story I ever hear starts telling me he feeling like people always watc
hing him (like the schizophrenia feeling) I tell him, relax, they just looking at car, it cool car… I forget matter same friend tells me and other friend that he hearing voices, I ignore him and go on minding my business while he talk to other friend… 2 month later I get vision, not voice, vision, in this vision I see woman walk to me, vision stop, I look back and I see same woman who walk to me standing behind me… I freakout and squil shot hi and look away… I go upstairs to use bathroom and I get another vision of me raping woman I see walk to me… vision scare me, make me shake like lwittle leaf… 1 month later I start saying people looking at me - like when friend say people looking at him - then I get schizophrenia and start hearing voice that no stop. So I ask myself, this friend, maybe he infect me with thing that be making him hear voices, coz me no hear voices or see freaky invisible lady walk in my head before he come talk about voices… or we both hear voices coz we both smoke same weed t
hat mess up mind and cause voices? or maybe he infect me with weird voice magic and vision magic?"

Unfortunately, I was shot down, as apparently there is not a grand communication network of every living soul in the universe that we can access. I was so angry about how I was treated, I burnt all the drawings and plans, and that was it. They were very angry with how I was treated, and this led them to be very abusive about doctors in particular, and I completely lost my mind and ended up on a forensic ward. My beliefs are firmly rooted in this experience, and it was real. I don’t care what anybody says, I will not change my mind as I remember it all with such clarity. Unfortunately it was too powerful for me to cope with on my own, and they should have tried communicating with someone who has the means to action their desire for us to advance before we destroy ourselves.

New members benefit greatly from perusing the many forums available here...lots to explore. Also after 5 approved posts members have the option to join the chatrooms..or chat one on one with other members.

175908178,"I've been quarantining alone with my mate since early March, seeing my therapist (service-related CPTSD, Major Depression) once a week via Zoom is the only time I get to speak to anyone else. My mate's apparently got a rip-roaring case of systemic Lupus, and suffered a serious and non-recoverable head injury in a car wreck a year and a half ago. She's easily confused, highly labile, and in chronic and debilitating pain and illness. She has no health insurance, and human services and Social Security and Medicaid have all been spectacularly unhelpful. According to her, at least four other houses (led by our _NAME_-villain next door neighbor) are spying on us; with computer and phone taps and secret motion detectors. They're beaming ultrasonic waves at us, and the odd car horn, car alarm, or the malfunctioning street light down the lane is really a means of signaling each other regarding our activities. They're slowly poisoning her garden and foliage. People are sneaking around in our woods at night. 
They've moved the markers at the corners of our property, and secretly moved the fences and phone poles to disguise the fact. Whatever evil they're doing, they're creating foul miasmic fumes and odors making her sick...which only she can smell. Often as not nowadays, I awake to this litany of crazy first thing in the morning, listen to it all day long, and she's often frenetically ranting about it as we go to bed at night. I've installed security cameras (they know how to defeat them), repeatedly measured off our property with survey in hand, a 100' tape & flags (you're wrong) paid for two (expensive) surveys (what if they're part of the conspiracy?), researched and learned that ultrasonic devices are hugely ineffective, have a range of < 300', and don't penetrate foliage, much less buildings (you're wrong), pointed out that it was highly unlikely anyone could rearrange phone poles without our noticing; what with us being home 24/7 due to the COVID-19 quarantine and all (you're wrong). When I try to apply rea
son & logic using empiricism and reality testing, she has flaming meltdowns and screaming hissy fits, gets verbally abusive, and threatens to leave me (or worse). When I try to apply empathy and compassion, acknowledging her fear and validating her need to feel safe, she has flaming meltdowns and screaming hissy fits, gets verbally abusive, and threatens to leave me (or worse). As I mentioned before, I have problems of my own, including depression, introversion, & Asperger's; I often struggle to interact and respond appropriately in the best of circumstances; I haven't a clue how to deal constructively with this. I've been up since 2:00 AM. Any moment, she'll awake, and the whole thing will start anew, and no matter what I do or how hard I try to help, it won't stop. It's just really, really hard right now."

You aren't really your thoughts when you have awareness. Some people just think that they are right all the time and that's not you but more extreme people that haven't felt pain. I can be in my head for days, imagining being famous or arguing with people that I argued with years ago and I'd be in the store buying something and say in my mind, ""you mother ****er! It's because of you that I'm depressed!"" Or ""shut up! Shut up! Just shut the hell upppp"". You are in the shift of personality like me.

I was thinking about the antipsychotic killing my brain cells, that I don't have schizophrenia or don't want it, that a farmer would judge me but then I realize that he was a pilot before he got the money. I took 200mg caffeine to sit down and read but ended up talking to people for turkey dinner. I felt stupid. I started to feel anxious and ""Schizo"" around everyone, holding my foot with my hand. We all went down to see christmas lights and I wanted to go home and sleep because I always feel better in the morning. Idk if I was having a dissociative panic attack, something to do with autism or psychosis. I felt really weird and didn't like technology where everyone was taking pictures.

She said to take an olanzepine and while I was waiting for it to kick in, she got me to watch something on TV that wouldn't make my psychosis worse - It was a christmas comedy. I started to watch it and couldn't understand ANYTHING. I couldn't laugh. Then I was laughing at things that weren't funny but I thought they were hilarious like an LSD trip. It finally kicked in and I went to sleep, woke up completely fine. I was also thinking about ESTP personalities and how they hate INFP but some have always liked me if they knew me.

175908360,"OK, that sounds good about the appointment and the Buspar situation. I had a rough childhood also. A lot of times in those situations, we were given our self-confidence by those who didn’t have any. We were given our self-concept, and our sense of positive or negative outlook on problems, by people who were negative. And at an impressionable age when we believed what our parent figures said. We adopted that, copied that without thinking, and then when we grew up we maintained that negative believe about our ability to solve problems, without there being an ounce of truth to it. We also hand our beliefs to our children, so we would want very much to teach our children to be positive about their ability to solve problems; about being positive in their approach to problems and in their lives. In our cases, a negative concept about our ability to solve problems can be turned off very quickly, if we simply come across the right information. Meanwhile, I’ve been looking up the symptoms of anxiety dis
order. From healthline.com, it says: 11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders 1. Excessive Worrying; 2. Feeling Agitated; 3. Restlessness; 4. Fatigue; 5. Difficulty Concentrating; 6. Irritability 7. Tense Muscles; 8. Trouble Falling or Staying Asleep; 9. Panic Attacks; 10. Avoiding Social Situations; 11. Irrational Fears Under 6. Irritability, it said, “Most people with anxiety disorders also experience excessive irritability. “According to one recent study including over 6,000 adults, more than 90% of those with generalized anxiety disorder reported feeling highly irritable during periods when their anxiety disorder was at its worst. “Compared to self-reported worriers, young and middle-aged adults with generalized anxiety disorder reported more than twice as much irritability in their day-to-day lives. “Given that anxiety is associated with high arousal and excessive worrying, it is not surprising that irritability is a common symptom.” So, you had asked, “do you think my agitation and excessi
ve outbursts are anxiety related?” It, again, says above, “According to one recent study including over 6,000 adults, more than 90% of those with generalized anxiety disorder reported feeling highly irritable during periods when their anxiety disorder was at its worst.” So that seems to answer your question, that anxiety and irritability are connected. You said you thought that connection between ""my agitation and excessive outbursts"" ""was just bc I didn't work harder to control my emotions. I've been told I'm a little high strung at times….” Under 2. Feeling Agitated, It says, “When someone is feeling anxious, part of their sympathetic nervous system goes into overdrive. This kicks off a cascade of effects throughout the body, such as a racing pulse, sweaty palms, shaky hands and dry mouth. ""These symptoms occur because your brain believes you have sensed danger, and it is preparing your body to react to the threat. Your body shunts blood away from your digestive system and toward your muscle
s in case you need to run or fight. It also increases your heart rate and heightens your senses."" ""While these effects would be helpful in the case of a true threat, they can be debilitating if the fear is all in your head. ""Some research even suggests that people with anxiety disorders are not able to reduce their arousal as quickly as people without anxiety disorders, which means they may feel the effects of anxiety for a longer period of time."""
175908361,"_AT_MENTION_ Oh, no! That’s so inconvenient! I never would have guessed that you’re having financial problems. I’m so sorry. I’m just getting passed almost being homeless. Here’s some tips… Call 211. They can give you names and numbers of places that help. So, if you need food, ask for places that help with food. Others are rent or mortgage, and utility bills. Call or go to your church. They can help with financial hardships. When you go to get help, you will probably get a list of places in your area that offer assistance. Call each one. If I were there, I would help. Since I can’t be, ask me whatever. I’ll tell you what I’ve done for myself. Also, there’s probably a mental health clinic with pdoc’s and therapists that work on a sliding fee schedule. We’re going to get you through this! Payers and thoughts are with you. Please keep me up to date. You’re important!"

175908388,"I think a lot of self love is connected with self respect. You have to do things that are good for you and avoid things that are bad for you. It’s often about making the right choice in the present. As a small example if you drink coffeine in the evening because you want it right there on the spot but you know it will ruin your sleep you are making a bad choice for yourself. Or if you keep smoking even though you have lung problems you are satisfying you immediate want, but neglecting your long term life. You also need to accept that things that are out of your control is not part of the equation. If you have to take ap’s, you can’t measure yourself against those who are not. You have to be kind to yourself in the regard that you accept that you have a illiness that sets limitations on your life and that this is not something you can do anything about. Focus on things that are within your control and make good decisions. Also I find it helps to always remember that you are not alone in this. 
There are millions of people out there that are struggling with more or less the same thing you are."

175908414,"It’s about 1:30 am, I just got back from the grocery store. I sometimes shop late at night there. Tonight I was just wandering around with some money to spend looking for something good that would hit the spot. I eventually settled on some expensive cheese. I’ve been experimenting by buying different types of cheeses for the last several months. I buy some I’ve never heard of just to try them. Anyways I had my packet of cheese but there were no cashiers, everybody was busy stocking shelves so I just stood there waiting for someone to notice me and ring up my cheese. And also I saw a bottle of orange vanilla coke so I thought I would try that too. I finally asked a worker to help me. While he was coming over I looked up and two guys were walking towards me. I didn’t know how to act at first, I kind of tried acting tough; I tried to bluff my way through it because I couldn’t tell if they were threatening or harmless. They passed me and kind of laughed at me because it was like I was telling 
_AT_MENTION_ earlier this evening, I treat everybody like they are innocent. But they passed me with no incident and I heard them them talking about how there’s no tellers so I told them I had just called one. I was being friendly and the cashier came and I walked over to stand in line behind the two guys who looked to be about 21 or 22 years old. And they were really polite!! They both looked at me and told me to go ahead of them. They only had one or two items each and I said, “Go ahead, you only have that item” but they still said go ahead. I detected no _USER_ID_ or anything like that. So I checked out and walked out hoping I had learned a lesson from that encounter. The whole incident lasted only a couple of minutes but it was a revelation to me that you can run into cool, friendly people even at 1:30 am. I finished my orange coke driving back home, it was nasty tasting and I’ll never buy it again."

I also get more excited lately, while before I was boiling in negatives, but I have now this nausea from this stress etc… I got bad now again… Should I continue trying no matter, that its painful now? Maybe the zyprexa will help more with the time?

175908428,Ok. I don’t want to start anything. I have to be careful
175908429,"You absolutely have a choice. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, no one is forcing you. You really do need to stop watching the news, comments section on news articles (which are abysmal no matter what side of the political spectrum site it is) and start focusing on yourself rather than other people. Its going to be hard for sure, you didnt get this way overnight. You have complex PTSD and its very often that people who experience that feel guilt for what happened to them and project others failings onto themselves. Its going to take time to unravel, but what you CAN do right now is stop feeding into that delusion via negative reinforcement. I think a part of you wants to think this way because its comfortable, and you seek things out that feed into this way of thinking, because youre either afraid or guilty of feeling good about yourself because of past trauma. Im no therapist, but were friends, and I see the same pattern in you that I did my sister. She made it out for the most part, so I assure you its pos
sible. But youre currently going the opposite direction, and its very frustrating to see you try and take the weight of the world on your shoulders. It will break your back; it would break anyones back."

174330841,"I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and now I?m diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. My current pdoc thinks that maybe I don?t even have Schizoaffective Disorder. He asked if I had one major symptom for more than 6 months, and the answer is no. I had dellusions for around 2-3 months (I remember the first time I had paranoia I was in college and I was hospitalized while studying at college) and I had disorganized speech for less than 1 month I guess (I checked the spelling of the emails I sent before hospitalization and they were okay, but, from what I remember, around 2 weeks before hospitalization, my speech was not so much, but still messed up). Maybe that?s why I?m high functioning, because maybe I don?t even have Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder. I had negative symptoms just after taking antipsychotics and what happened was probably Neuroleptic-Induced Deficit Syndrome (NIDS). It means my ?negative symptoms? were caused by antipsychotics, an not by the illness itself. I?m on a reduc
ed dose of antipsychotic (7,5 mg of aripiprazole) and all my negative symptoms are practically gone. Since 2015 (the first time I was hospitalized), I don?t have dellusions neither psychosis. I don?t understand completely about diagnosis protocols, but I think I don?t have sz neither sza. I probably have Bipolar (which was my diagnosis before my psychosis)."

175908453,You talked about a love-hate relationship. Is it with the object of what your porn habit is? If so that is what you need to address. Why do you hate the people you want to make love too? When you understand that you can begin to unchain yourself from the habit. If you loved what you are attracted too porn would not be a problem. I know guys who have a healthy relationship with porn and the object of their desire. However if you fantasize or dream about harming who you look at in porn of then its a problem. I did not achieve the goal of having a real relationship with those I was looking at through porn but I calmed down and came to understand to a great degree the hate that was consuming me.

Australia was trying to get everyone smoke free by 2020 and smokes like a pack of 20s went from roughly $12 all the way up to $25 and that’s the cheapest pack New Zealand the neighbouring country is something like $35-$40 for pack of 20s… I think I’d rather pay our big amount than have to go cold turkey… I feel for you! Good luck
174330851,"Yeah there must be something else I am missing, maybe a biomarker they can target vs individual patients. I think it must be something like that: Our precision medicine platform technology allows us to predict drug responses in patients and guide enrollment in our smart clinical trials. So I am guessing, but I can’t be sure, that this phase 2 drug they are calling TR-01 is something that they have licensed, or maybe developed themselves, but it maybe it used to be called something else. Kind of like how one of Pfizer’s drugs is now BIIB-104."

174330867,"It depends. Unfortunately I have Schizophrenia and Autism, but despite this fact, I live in a very expensive part of the UK, so I have had to work through all this. Finding a supportive employer is a start. Maybe you know someone you can contact who knows your situation and might cut you some slack? That’s what happened to me, and I stuck at it for 6 years until it got bought out by an American company Luckily I have a trade to fall back on, as before my SZ diagnosis I was a landscaper for 7 years. You won’t like it but you have to take some risks sometimes, and they can pay off, but keep your expectations to a point where you’re making sound moves."

175908486,"I am stuck most of the day but forced to do things for my family later. I make a list early in the day, then make a list in order of how I will do it. Then I sit for 4 hours and do nothing. Then if I can’t go on the treadmill I touch it, sometimes rarely that works. Sometimes I use the washroom and turn on the shower, sit in bedroom and let it run until I get in, that works now and then. Deadlines help but they have to be real. If we are going out with friends or to our kids show then must shower. I tend to try new methods or new hobbies and they don’t work for long but these could work for you"

I know that people who ascribe to religions aren’t crazy for example believing _NAME_ parted the Red Sea according to the DSM; it’s part of the social context.

175908504,"Could I ask if you can perceive them from outside of your ears or from inside, would the whispers respond to your own subvocalization, would they be present 24/7 hours a day, if you hum or start a conversation with somebody does it block out the whispers. Would placeing handphones on give you some momentary relief. Would you have trouble sleeping due to noticing them more. Would you relate to any of this things."
175908505,"ah my anxiety,i cant breath."
175908506,"A lot of us have been there _PERSON_ with either chronic illness, mental illness, or both and it's hard. But I love your resilient attitude. Because of that, you will be okay. No, the pain won't go away or magically cure itself, but resilience has been proven to help people in difficult or unchangeable circumstances to do better and even find joy again. I love this checklist from an article I read about the challenge of unchangeable circumstances. I use it whenever I flare up from my disease and become housebound, sometimes bed-bound for awhile. If unchangeable circumstances seem to be controlling your life, try the following: Focus on what you can control. For example, you may not have full control over your health, but can you exercise, eat healthful food, and get sufficient rest? Clarify what you would like to accomplish in life. Break it down into small steps. Try to spend at least a little time each day working toward your goals. Do tasks, even small ones, that give you a sense of control. Cle
an the kitchen table, and wash the dishes. Dress neatly. Do the most important tasks first thing in the morning. Look at the possible benefits of your circumstances. For example, does your situation give you greater insight into ways of coping with difficulties? Can you use this insight to help others? Bottom Line: You may not be able to control your circumstances, but you may be able to control your response to them. This has been so helpful to me. And exercising when one is in pain feels impossible, but even if you can only do upper body exercises for 5 minutes, it can make you feel like you are doing something for the betterment of your health, both physical and mental. I hope this list was helpful and I wish you well."
175908507,That’s awesome!!! What is your doctorate in? What research are you doing for it? What will you be doing for the internship?
175908508,"Yes, a bit. I’d love to do boxing but I don’t trust any trainers in my area and fear they will come for me. Place is chaotic stupid to some Ppl. But I did learn off the morning show. Hard Weapon - Soft Target Use HARD WEAPON - elbow, wrist bit of palm of hand and knee. Your elbow is very hard weapon On a SOFT TARGET nose, throat, eyes, groin, shin For example palm of hand to nose will break it. Don’t punch or you will hurt yourself as not many Ppl can punch properly. Finger to eye - hard poke eye gouge Then run like the wind as fast as you can, get out of there asap."

175908511,Everyone is clumsy and slow when they start a new job. It’s perfectly normal. You shouldn’t be so hard on yourself
175908512,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ !
175908513,"To clarify, in saying the above, I didn't mean to imply at all that you enjoyed thinking that way. It's just possible that in a management position, you might find yourself ""having"" to think that way a lot, unless you wise like _PERSON_ and can find a workaround."
175908514,Finally got my medical info updated....
175908515,"I think it’s just a culture and “youth” thing, fit in a scene kind of thing. Did you ever feel like alcohol specifically contributed to or worsened psychotic illness?"
175908516,"But the most amazing thing is that my ""projections"" have been disproved as mere projections. Amazingly, my schizoid friend is teaching me more about friendship and about myself than most of the relationships I've ever had. I feel wondrously lucky."
175908517,"I'm ready for it to be friday. Plus I'm bored today. _PERSON_ already gave me his part of the first months rent. I put it in savings. I'm always bored on sundays. I think for other things we need in the house, I will just do cyber monday deals. I'm not doing black friday deals cuz you have to be in person to do that, and that's way too much commotion for me. We've got the sofa, big chair, and _NAME_ desk. We need a futon and other smaller furniture items, plus a kitchen table. Will get the kitchen table at the resale store. Everything else I'll wait til cyber Monday."
175908518,"I am exercising again! We have a VR game called Beat Saber. Has anyone played? It is a dancing game. We modded it so we can get all kinds of songs, rather than just the ones that come with the game. It makes me feel like I’m playing, instead of working out. It is nice to feel capable of doing things that are good for me, rather than feeling like it is abject torture. I highly recommend this game for anyone with VR. You need to use it with PC if you want the custom songs, but even the songs it comes with are good."
175908519,"Yeah I wear weight in my gut too which they say is bad. SOME get it in the buttocks, which I wanna say is healthier? I really think though that that’s more rare."
175908520,"For vitamin d, 20 is normal but optimal is 50 to 80. Same like thyroid. 20 is only required for bone health but optimal needed for overall health as vitamin d have many functions. Vitamin b12 normal is 200 but optimal 500. People get symptoms in normal level too."

175908523,I know…it is just that i seem to have trouble with it and it runs in the family. I was adviced by a doctor to cut back on it (and a few other things) and see what it did.
175908524,Congratulations ! 1 mg Haldol is very little.

175908528,"Hi, I have psychotic depression. I don’t qualify for sza because of my frequent remissions. Does anyone here with psychotic MDD ever feel like their psychiatrist doesn’t take them seriously because of your frequent remission(s)? I’ve been on remission for 3-4 months (again- but not quitting my meds, they’re lifesavers) but in the meantime depression has been hitting my face. Having psychotic depression means that you’re more mood disorder-dependent and not psychosis-dependent. When psychosis happens, it’s usually brutal but doesn’t land me to the hospital. But the doctor has been disregarding my symptoms as non-serious. Does anyone feel like your doctor isn’t doing their job?"
175908529,Oh ok nvm I thought you meant keep the cat away from society not BB My mind is really going
175908530,"Yeah, i can’t work it out either anymore. I try to make the most out of what i got left (morals,dignity,ethics) not much, but enough to survive."

175908534,Wow wonder what med did all this amazing progress!
175908535,"It works completely differently and works at the ideal, sweet spot of 42mg. It doesn’t work more if you have more or less. Think of it like ‘Goldilocks’ habitable zone in space.

175908536,Does Starlet like ice cream or does he have a favorite pizza? I’d say if he showers three times a week then maybe you could take him to Dairy Queen and he can have whatever treat he wants but only once a week. I can understand giving a child a few dollars for making the honor roll or some other achievement but to get paid to take care of yourself is quite another. How’s the momming going in general Ninja?

175908538,Maybe you should just take a break and relax for a couple days then. Don’t worry about talking to your pdoc until you feel like it. There is no rush.
175908539,Maybe call 111? I was referred to primary care plus mental health service after I left my cpn team. I meet up with a mental health nurse once every while like per month. Maybe ur GP has that service if you are interested

175908560,Why don’t you try Noom? It’s a weight loss app. You record your food so it’s kind of like a game and then they gradually increase your steps so you can do steps to lose weight. I lost 10 pounds on it but took a break. I’m trying to motivate myself to do it again.
174330875,Mightn’t be the antipsychotic . But the same thing happened me and now I have to take metformin to keep it under control. I’m on abilify.
175908561,"Maybe you should try Reiki or Yoga, energy work. Ways to learn to control the flow of Chi or energy through you. It would help with the mania. Learning to relax your body, and learn to direct the wave of energy through you. I think all humans are natural energy conduits, and how we experience energy can impact us differently. What helps me is I light a white candle every evening, I burn sandwalwood incense and palo santo. So far this just calms me completely, helps with the mania side of things. Spring also brings out mania in some people. Cutting back on coffee and stimulants is important. Getting lots of rest. But the best medicine for mania is exercise, yoga, and being in nature/or just outside."
174330870,"Some people never fit cleanly into one specific box. I carried the NOS diagnosis the entire time I had my first pdoc, because he said due to my brain tumor I didn’t fit into any other category. My new pdoc disagreed. Relapse does not always mean SZ. Sometimes it means borderline, or PTSD, or drug-induced psychosis, or a number of other possibilities. Schizophrenia is rare, as far as psychotic disorders go."
174330874,The subject line says it all. Here’s what I’ve tried and had no success with: 5-htp Glycine (it offically decreases the effectiveness of Clozapine by the way! ) NAC (it seems to decrease the effectiveness of abilify in my experience) L-theanine+coffee (no effect on motivation)

I’d like to do it, but it depends on what my psychiatrist tell me tomorrow. If I don’t like his conditions, then I won’t do it. I’ll tell you as soon as I talk to him."

175908593,"I have no right to be making this suggestion, since I am one of those people who usually comes here only when I am in need. So feel free to take this post with a grain of salt. But my plea to all all of you is when you read a post on this forum, please try to respond if you have anything useful to say -- or even just to offer perspective and support. Nearly every post on a forum like this one is, in some way, a cry for help. Anxiety is terribly isolating, and we all want to be heard and understood. Responses show we are heard and understood. There are some anxiety forums where there are lots of posts and nearly nobody ever responds. Those forums are not of any use. This one is not like that. Usually, there are responses to most every post. At a minimum, SC tries to respond to just about everyone. But this forum would be even more useful if there were more responses to every post. (You can see an example of this in the HW prostate cancer forum, for example -- which I think is the ideal for what an o
nline health related forum should be). As I said at the outset, I am probably the wrong person to be making this plea, given my own limited participation here. So you certainly have a right to disregard what I am saying here. But I thought it was important to say it anyway. And I will try to follow my own advice too."

175908595,"I was this way too. I felt alcohol was an anti anxiety medicine. For a year and a half it was. And I did it before everything. I still was very quiet but I felt better about being quiet among other things. Then my Alcoholism took a step back. This next year I was on meds and barely drank however did get a dui. I blew a .11 but I was on meds so it was probably making me slur words more than usual. Still above the legal limit tho. I haven’t driven drunk at all since , if anything alcohol makes my anxiety worse now. So that’s even more of a reason not to drive intoxicated. Well anyways my alcoholism progressed a bit when I was on probation. Remember I was a pothead and I was facing psychosis and addiction so my mind demanded alcohol. Somebody told me it “increased creativity” so I started abusing it. Black out drunk 6 times a week on cheap stuff. Cheap handles of vodka or malt liquor. Well then in 2014 I realized I needed a change. May of 2014 and after that was definitely my rock bottom. I tr
ied rehabs and AA but the only thing that worked for me is anti-alcohol medications. Honest to god there’s no way in freaking hell I wouldn’t be drinking today if not for my meds. But alas I haven’t drank much since December of 2015 now when I started naltrexone. And Zoloft cut down my drinking a bit more. But that’s just me. More power in the world to people who use AA and stuff but to me, I’d rather not have to fight the disease. That’s just how I experience it. Going to AA or just trying to white knuckle it and not do it is an every day fight. I wake up in the morning , I don’t even think of alcohol until my friend pulls out a bottle of wine and starts drinking in front of me and I have no desire"

His exit from Hollywood was actually caused by a devastating injury. While filming a horseback scene for Letters From A... Bad Habits The star had a life-long love affair with nicotine. He picked up smoking in his youth and at the height of his stardom it was said that he smoked up to 60 cigarettes each day. Sadly, the habit caught up with him and he even said during his final days, “I will go so far as to say probably smoking had something to do with my pancreatic cancer.” Shockingly, the actor smoked until his last days. _NAME_ the Believer _NAME_ was a spiritual man and is quoted saying, “I believe in a higher power. I’ve studied Eastern philosophies, and I’ve studied the Koran. We’ve devalued everything worth believing in. Now we’re tearing into religion. A line should be drawn.”

175908688,"If I understand what you are trying to say or imply, many ufologists believe those types of weapons cause a tear or rip in space-time, bringing or pissing off extraterrestrials. I don’t know if I believe that. I think we live in a simulation and they don’t want us destroying ourselves, which begs the question: is earth that important to them?"

174330901,"It varies by person. For some, it stays psychosis NOS. For some, they get moved to Psychotic Depression, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, sleep apnea, OCD with intrusive thoughts, PTSD, schizoaffective, or schizophrenia. All psychosis NOS means is that the person definitely had a psychotic episode, but they don’t yet fit cleanly into another category. Think of it like naming types of cars. You can recognize a _NAME_, a Lambroghini, a Hyundai, a Kia, etc. But suppose a car drives by too fast for you to get a good look at it. If someone asks you what type of car it was, you you don’t know. You know it was definitely a car, so you might say “I don’t know what kind of car that is.” That is psychosis NOS. “Hm, this is definitely a psychosis, but we don’t know what kind.”"

175908700,"LMD, Yeah! So glad to hear that all was well with the breast concern... ...and to put your mind at ease, dense breast tissue turns out to not be a risk for BC any longer. That is a concern of the past when screening was not as effective as it is today. The dense tissue itself doesn't raise risk...it was that women who had fibroids and developed (unrelated) tumors weren't properly dx'd because they *used* to be more difficult to find on the older x-ray films and mammos. Now as far as the phlegm streaked with blood goes...it could be from the drier air as _NAME_ mentioned...very common this time of year. You are likely breathing deeply with sleep and drying out your mucous membranes, and then it is expelled when you get up and cough. (think of a bloody nose that is draining into your throat as you sleep) As _PERSON_ said, the only way to know for sure it to ask your doctor, but I am really confident that you have nothing to worry about ! Keep working on your HA goals. You are getting better at gettin

175908701,No. What you are describing is modern life on Earth. I feel your pain because I’m always surprised by how stupid people can be. That really gets on my goat but I get over it pretty quickly… You can’t put in place guidelines for idiots…it just doesn’t work.

The grief, the anger and the hate and the self destruction destroyed my body… I lived as suicidal and not other thought almost for 15 years… this marks, this marked me. Many sz are not marked like that, but my pain was special Maybe this was too much for everyone idk… anyway. I guess the body shape is reversible. Only if I feel better in my head too also… I really think that I was rejected cause I looked bad. It’s very sad this. I was in tremendous pain since the age of 10 and I was judged badly… Ok, sorry if I sound sick now, I just turned numb from fatigue…"

175908710,"Tried leaving the hospital but they were mean to me there in 2015. Probably the worst thing is posting my thoughts on youtube and making videos. I don’t even remember half of it. I do regret some of it, but it had to be done to get the trauma out. Maybe be too trusting of people and not understanding and reading body language. I experienced some trauma and all the ‘kinds’ from alien abductions over many lifetimes. I somehow came back alive and became a Christian. They don’t like atheists, which might come off as rude and offensive. It’s sort of a control thing. I don’t even know they’re politics – maybe socialism. Some were totalitarian in mind. Sort of like demons but real and life-like. I believe in reptilians, which is sort of embarassing now that I realize it’s been a mainstream thing all of a sudden. I mean it sounds crazy. I have a lot of delusions and ‘confabulation’ and self-created delusions. Like I think I was an alien and wrote ""Urantia’. Then I also think I went 
inter-dimensional and left the simulation and was targeted by reptilians/computer simualtors and escaped. It fits the narrative of things but I think I ‘took’ or applied other people’s experiences with mine, and sort of tainted my memories and experiences with others. I never had past life regression, seen a psychic, or had those types of therapies. So I did what I had to do. I watch something, it resembles something, and then I attribute to me in another dimension basically. Like even other people being me. I have some examples, but rather avoid talking about certain things."

175908723,"Yes, this. It’s taken me a long time to get here, but I am no longer jealous of others. I have learned over the years that almost everyone has some kind of burden. We may look at someone and think they have it all together, but in reality, they have a struggle just like we do. I worked with someone once who was successful in her job, but known for being abrasive. No one liked her and most people avoided her. I always tried to be nice to her. One day she told me that she was a victim of domestic violence. Suddenly it made sense why she was so mean. It didn’t forgive it, but I would have never guessed that. There’s been plenty of other people in my life who were secretly struggling with major issues. I have always been a beacon for people to open up to me in real life, so I’ve heard a lot. I might be dealing with a major psychiatric illness, but that is no better or worse than many other things. It’s not worth disrupting your joy by being jealous!"
175908724,Vraylar isn’t a miracle med _AT_MENTION_ It made me super crazy and I ended up involuntarily committed to a subpar psychiatric hospital twice for 5 weeks. What I’m saying is it may not even work for you. You might as well try Geodon because it’s available in Canada.
174330903,Having schizophrenia is tiring. I don’t like schizophrenia
175908725,It depends how deep down the rabbit hole you are. If you are full blown psychotic and completely lost its easy to diagnose. Most of people with SZ normally become really good at hiding things though !

175908728,"I was going to quit today but I didn’t do it. I am seeing occupational health about getting my hours reduced, and hopefully that will help. I am nervous as I have never had to strong arm work before into giving me flexible time off. I used all my holiday and nearing imploding from stress and my symptoms are getting much worse. Every time I am ill, it’s because of work. I need to work, but I am not worried about earning loads of money. If I can get by on 3 or 4 days a week, I will be happy and just about be able to pay my bills, I also contacted the benefit people and re-ignited my PIP (UK) claim, so I might have to get assessed and could get some help there. I spoke to the mental health team as well and complained about my case manager. He has left me with no contact for two months. I even had the police at my flat on saturday because they thought I was going to kill myself. I talked my way out of that though. I could have lost my drivers license again. Been a busy day. I might go off sick tomo

And you cannot weigh other people’s problems based on your definition of worse diseases known to mankind. Someone who is going through something else might be in so much pain that they feel like it’s their destiny to suffer. So my answer to your question is: no, you are not destined to suffer.

I would like to be a content writer but need to gain experience in it. I also want to polish my writing. I like writing although I am not too good at it yet. I tried doing medical translation without a CAT tool. That was dumb!! I know most medical translators use CAT tools so for me to do without one was a dumb idea. I am thinking of buying one then apply for translation jobs. First, I need to know how to use the CAT tool so it is not as if it will be easy to use one without training. I am also looking into a writing program online. I hope to polish my writing. I write rather poorly. But, I am interested in writing well so I am motivated.

I’m doing well compared to before. I have no complaints to him. I have no symptoms. I will continue with my routine of work, sleep, and some exercise. I should eat a healthier diet. These days I’ve been skipping eating daily. I sometimes get by just drinking coffee and eating some chocolate, then eating big the next day. It is not healthy. I am lazy because I am getting sick of shopping bulk at stores for food. I like variety in my life. Before, I was eating the same type of foods weekly but was becoming bored with it. So, I now eat out occasionally, Here, most places are open so there is not any problem with dining in restaurants. In a nutshell, I am doing ok but am, at times, bored with my routine.

175908845,"It’s just that a person who suffers from psychosis shouldn’t be encouraged by a mental health worker to believe spirits are in their home because it can affect them really negatively. The individual could then become paranoid and obsessed about it. So, if she knows you’ve had psychosis you should definitely switch. If she doesn’t know, you should inform her. Plus, I wouldn’t like someone pushing their religious beliefs on me. Using sage to cast our bad spirits or to cleanse a room or home or building is a religious belief. It has no place in therapy at all."

They played a sound aligned with an image and then sometimes when they showed the image without the sound, people would still hear the sound. I hope this isn’t why I get faint voices. Like they only come when I expect them too. That would mean my faint voices (which I hear when stressed) aren’t related to my main voice and are something different. airgo i have no evidence that my main voice is not real. And _AT_MENTION_ , can you tell me my faint voices aren’t some automatic reaction to stress when expecting to hear something!"
175908847,"Update: After taking Seroquel 300mg lastnight, it felt dreadful getting out of bed. I had to wake twice in the middle of the night to pee, and also to drink a bit of water as my mouth was super dry from this stuff. Getting up to go pee felt like I was really drunk and disoriented. It was more of a challenge than it should have been. I slept more than 12 hours and drank 2 coffees today just to feel somewhat awake. It is now 5 o clock and I still feel somewhat sedated. I am told that this side effect of extreme somnolence wears off after a week or two of using Seroquel. I was glad that I did not have anything important to do today, otherwise I would have had to cancel. I am thinking of cutting my Seroquel in half for a few days and taking 150mg before going back to 300mg, I know this isn’t recommended to do, but I can’t go another week or so feeling like I did today. This is by far the most sedating AP I have been on. I even got these jolts from time to time today of adrenaline kicking in for a s

If I have a brother that lives with me that chides me for bashfulness, and I go to a psychologist, I may have a personality disorder. If he moves away or I go not, I shall not. In short words, someone is a loner in someones opinion, but there is no outer examination to certify him of it. Someone has a personality disorder if he seeks help from a psychologist and meets the terms."

I can’t take Risperidone because it tricked my body into thinking it was pregnant by causing my prolactin to increase. I stopped having a period for 14 months, started lactating.

175908902,"For all you folk who are into sayings from the fifties. I went to my dermatologist today. She removed a lump from my head a couple of weeks ago and had it tested and today she gave me the results and it was benign. Not cancer. But going there was an experience. Some hard truths hit me and that’s all I will say about that. But I walked in and the young receptionist started being bitchy and copped an attitude (for all of you who are into sixties sayings). I don’t know what it is with her. We had our little run-ins before but we were getting along fine I thought. And I sat down and it just really irked me. So I kind of glared at her and stared until she totally folded and 77nick77 wins again right after they were counting me down for the count. (for people who care about seventies sayings) And the funniest part was that it was 100% appropriate. It is one of those wins when someone starts trouble and totally has the tables turned on them. (eighties). And some stupid kid who I had nothing against st
arted acting a little like a punk so we got a little unfriendly. By the way, this is not typical, I get along fine and I am mostly friendly but I don’t why this happened. But it happened and I was pissed. So I waited and made sure the girl felt bad but the weirdest thing happened. I saw the doctor and it was serious but we had a few laughs and on the way out I had to make an appointment for three months from today. And I said something and the girl smiled and I said something nice and she’s young and kind of cute in her own way and she lightened up and all of a sudden I was the older adult making her feel good about herself. It wasn’t flirting but there was an element of it that was again 100% appropriate for my age. And I turned to go and said have a nice day and I forgot to mention that a really pretty mature woman had walked in with a fantastic body so I seized the day and on my way out I looked her in the eye and smiled and said, “And you have a good day too.” And I was rewarded with a great smi

175908904,_AT_MENTION_ Sounds like you are delusional and hallucinating again. Could you increase the med if you don’t want to be admitted into the hospital?
174330941,"I’ve thought about it and asked about it a few times but basically decided there’s no point since a new drug isn’t going to reverse the sexual side effects. But since you’ve only been on it a little while maybe getting off it and going on abilify (or something else) is the best choice! When they put me on invega I was in hospital for months on a high dose and didn’t know about abilify, so by the time I got out it would have been too late to switch anyway."

175908907,_AT_MENTION_ Thanks for that . I think being bullied as a pre teen and/or teenager is a regular occurrence for those of us later found to be on the spectrum . Both people on the spectrum and those with sz have difficulty when it comes to eye contact . Having both can give a person a double dose of that .

I know I reacted really badly to certain AP's but other AP's I seem to be able to tolerate without weird side effects.

175908938,"Mine is at night, morning and situational."
174330944,I am doing well. I am leaving my situation soon. I will be going to another country to work. I decided to leave early next month because most people there in this other country are still working despite the corona virus situation. I want to work also but believe I will start later next month or in April. I am relieved to have found a job although it is not great but can make it full-time. It has no benefits except for paid transportation. I am not complaining at my age. It is sad to be out of work for so long. I am glad that I am going but at the same time I must be careful. I feel fine. I am healthy for now and am stable. I have to take care of myself this time because my parents are elderly and cannot take care of me anymore. I was helping them. I am stable on the lower dosage so far and will make sure to get my next shot at the next clinic. I am a bit anxious but will be fine. Life goes on.
175908939,I’m sorry that Canada’s having new cases of this as well. Surprising that this person got it from Iran.
175908940,"Hey _PERSON_, not much, went to the conservatory this morning....how about you?"
175908941,"I’m an Arab and I know what you mean. When I came out, most of my family stopped talking to me. It is very frowned upon in our culture. But the only way for the world to change is for people like you to step up and be kind to our gay brothers and sisters. _AT_MENTION_ sexuality can be fluid, and gradually shift over time. I think most people aren’t 100% gay or straight, but somewhere in the middle. It’s just that, in the past, we were only presented with two choices. So most people just stuck to dating the gender they liked most. Now, it’s more acceptable for people to like multiple genders, so more people are starting to recognize that side of themselves."
175908942,thanks! Just moving my ass to get out my parents’ home. I do need support.
175908943,"Keep it to your thread, _AT_MENTION_-Cotton. You’ve asked this question before."
175908944,"There is no such thing as a $75,000 house in my State. Yeah where do you live?"
175908945,"I dont cry anymore, havent in years"
175908946,It doesn’t matter anymore since she is now gone. You have to forget her and let go of her. Though she will be a part of your memories.
175908947,"Yes, things will improve, take your antipsychotic treatment and all the nightmare will disappear, a hug"
175908948,Go to the store. The grocery store and pharmacy usually have books and crossword puzzles etc.
175908949,"You mentioned once how alcohol works on our brain, and I nodded my head, and thought, yes, that was my creative process lol Me trying to be creative often involves a musical piece without lyrics, that I listen to on repeat until I have a story I've set to it. I was talking to my boss about how it takes me longer to appreciate music now because of my loss of pleasure, so I told him I create stories in my head now, and he said he learned that by way of a master class at his university with his classical guitar degree. Here's a musical piece that I wrote my last short story to. SEGA _USER_ID_ - YouTube Wait... Don't you play the guitar, bro?"
175908950,It sure is. Very painful.
175908951,Here my part of UK it’s grey too. It does affect my mood
175908952,80% of the autistic people I know have delusions or hallucinations Seems weird to me
175908953,"I also have GERD and anxiety and I do believe that they feed from each other. My anxiety has been very high lately and I have also all these weird stomach and back/chest pains. Just like you my appetive is kind of bad because I am afraid I may feel worse with the food. I think you should keep taking the PPI and once the anxiety gets lower, your stomach should to. Best wishes."
175908954,They don’t look anything alike.
175908955,"What if you didnt listen to music, or play vid games for a week. Would you try something new?"
175908956,Symptoms vanish in due time
175908957,"So nice, now you can put your make up all out if you want to, if you wear make up or lotions"
174330950,I’ve been on clopixol for 15 years for the last 3 or 4 I’ve been taking a top up dose of Abilify added … dose 10mg I was on a high dose of clopixol 75mg when 50 is the maintenance dose So gone down to 50 mg clopixol and up to 15 of abilify I also put down the drinking I was doing in December since over a week ago and started exercising and fasting … eating any food I want (carefully) between 10am and 6pm as a lifestyle And started yoga 5-6 days a week again with bits of extra normal life things like walking and cycling Because I know that when I do yoga for an hour or two it makes me be able to do so much more It’s just that I’ve been obese and unfit for a few months / years Been dancing around feeling a bit out of it… Nice stuff still Sensible to just keep things simplified
175908958,I take 400mg daily in the morning and shove em up my ass
175908959,Be cool with sharing book excerpts peeps. There are laws and such to govern those things and this is a public website. I think a couple of images is cool but promoting illegal or such copies is against the rules.
175908960,Does that mean I’m delusional again?
175908961,ah thanks _AT_MENTION_ that means a lot
175908962,Sorry to hear that. Going inpatient on the psych ward isn’t the end of the world. It might do you good.
175908963,"You say you can’t do anything, yet today you posted you helped put together a grill. Those aren’t that easy. Then you cooked on the grill, you even showed the food you said you made."
175908964,too much? Lol
175908965,No your ok I thought of that too. i texted him before but he never replied I didn’t have the balls to ring him because I knew he would only let on that I’m crazy
175908966,"well i care too much, 2 b honest maybe"
175908967,I just think I’m a deceptive ?????
175908968,Usually the demons don't bother me and they're just hanging out in the background. I can't get this feeling that they're trying to posses me and make me hurt other people. I don't want to hurt people. I don't want to be possessed and hurt people. I don't know what to try.
174330948,Even my mother told me that I had much more control on my emotions before schizophrenia.
175908969,I am feeling better now…thank you
175908970,"My mother, the community are desperate to keep me subordinate, they use violence, stalking, harassment, intimidation, mental abuse!!!"
175908971,Everyone has superiors. Work hard enough and long enough and well enough and maybe you’ll get to be one.
175908972,I don’t know if a cure is possible but better and sooner treatment is possible. And it might be preventable in the future.
175908973,"Not always. Statistics are misleading. Damage to the _USER_ID_ makes self control and emotional regulation fore difficult, but not impossible. If people get the idea that they can do bad things without guilt because they can just blame their illness, they won’t have incentive to do better."
174330965,Taurine works for me. It makes me calm.
175908974,Those are all very good acconplishments! I just want to make sure you’re eating enough. Low blood sugar could cause suicidal ideation in someone who is prone to it.
175908975,Just woke up. Going to study English grammar and some words. The test will be tomorrow so I have to be prepared!
175908976,Telling someone that their beliefs are unacceptable is very important and necessary when those beliefs are “some people aren’t human beings” or “it is okay to kill anyone with this color skin.”
175908977,I take risperidone regular Haldol prn
175908978,Lol. At least you still have your sense of humour.
175908979,"Corn is profitible because it is subsidized by the government. If more nutritious foods were subsidized the way corn is, the country would be in a very different place."
175908980,"I don’t think I’ll ever get unprescribed a benzo, they want me on it. Crazy how with the same illness, docs can be totally different. But benzos help me with psychotic nightmares that I’ve had since a child, and even though my recall memory sucks, my bf said my artwork I do often is amazing and is only getting better so he said I have to look at my strengths. Benzos are both a blessing and a curse. Maybe I can get that powder and be on a miniscule dose of benzo though… I’ll have to ask my pdoc next week"
175908981,I made some haikus in Greek. I had a lot of fun
175908982,"I get mine on the third, came in early this morning. I would have hit my savings goal just barely, but the sudden deduction of the cost of a ticket to California yesterday put me beneath it. I’ll hit the mark next month, hopefully the trip will be worth the money."
175908983,I love broccoli
175908984,"I wonder if someone here who is schizoid, is in relationship or married with another schizoid? Or maybe someone knows such couple? Share please."
175908985,I for one could care less what your ethnicity is. I don’t mean that in a rude or mean way. We’re friendly here. Glad to have you arkada?
174330953,"Schizoaffective disorder is when you don’t have full SZ symptoms. Its important to diffrentiate negative symptoms from depression. They look the same but are not. I have negative symptoms, psy prescribed antidepressant but it was useless, only more sleep."
175908986,I have sza and do occasionally have violent thoughts inserted into my head but I’ve never acted on them. I was only violent towards myself sometimes. But on meds I don’t have it much anymore. I feel fairly normal most of the time
174330957,"I would never stop meds again for life. I stopped once, my psychi approved and I was so aggressive and insane that after a year I nearly killed my self and was fighting violently with my family for no reason. They called 911 and 4 cops came to calm me. They were about to tase me. I was yelling nonsense and the 4 cops told me to never stop my meds. They didn’t leave me until I saw an emergency psychiatrist who gave me _PERSON_. There is no point in stopping meds because I still had negative and cognitive plus positive symptoms during the whole year during which I wasn’t medicated."
175908987,"It certainly is a crusade. I don’t know about you, but it is a constant battle of some sort or another for me. However, it has gotten easier with the medication."
175908988,I am from Nepal …Born in village Side…
175908989,My dr sent the sample to the lab today. They said I’ll find out Tuesday if I need better than Clindamycin capsules
175908990,That’s why you’re nuts . You can’t tell the difference . You lack insight
175908991,"I tried to lower latuda from 80 to 40 with doctors reluctant approval, it didn’t go well. Within a couple of weeks I was hearing things and seeing insects again. I am back on 80 and feeling better."
175908992,Active duty here (Army). I hear voices a lot of the time but just do my best to not give them peace of mind as they don’t deserve it. On the downside it is like I’m constantly having to block them out. Why I listen to music or podcasts a lot to help block them out easier. I know it may seem selfish of me to be in the military with something like this. Just biding my time and getting out next year. I can do this.
175908993,Scooter hoping for monday! Sleep hit n miss. Mostly pn recliner. Am told it is being built. Cheers. HT
175908994,"Yeah, it sucks, but at least we are still able to feel some joy… i have been on every mood stabilizer, some didn’t work (lamictal, depakote) some made me numb (lithium, lyrica)"
175908995,"Try focusing on 1 thing in the room. Notice what it looks like, what it feels like, etc. Spend about 5 mins. If needed, try another object. It’s tough, at first. You can do this!"
175908996,"So tomorrow morning my nan, aunty and mum are going to meet me out for a lunch to celebrate my birthday. I’m pretty worried about it. Things like seeming weird or gettinf anxiety at the lunch are getting me down and making me feel tense today. It’s so hard to battle my social anxiety… I just wanna hide forever. But I know that’s not healthy and I need to get out occasionally and be social. It’s just so stressful."
175908997,I can only relate to the dream stuff. I’ve been having bizarre dreams lately that might be real lol.
175908998,"My dad was always an ass-hat. He was never there for me when I was growing up, that’s why I started doing drugs and hanging out on the streets. All he cared about was if I did my homework and how school was going. He never spent any time with me. When I was DXd at 21, that’s when he started paying attention. He started playing basketball with me, taking me to baseball games, fishing, camping etc. Everything my father did for me, he did it 10 years too late. And he hasn’t since his first born son in over 30 years. His first wife left him and he married my mom and moved here. My dad was never a little girl, he was a little b-tch."
174330958,"Some of the points from my points that you disagreed with. 1. You say you have depression and adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). (You say you do not have bipolar, because you have none of the signs of that.) So you have depression and adhd. You say: 1. I’ve been on antidepressants for 20 years. 2. I was going through a tough patch with my Drs help wanting to wean off. I believe my entire “episode” of having the feeling I was losing control was caused by a decrease in my meds at a way to rapid pace. 3. My Dr was attempting to assist me in getting off EffexorER (20 years usage) (drugs.com says Effexor ER is an antidepressant. (New Question A: If you’re depressed, why is your doctor taking you off of anti-depressant? Why is there no mention of a new anti-depressant she was trying to put you on?) 4. I was dropped pretty rapidly (from Effexor ER) anti-depressant). 5. while doing this, I found it counterproductive but, she had me on Seroquel (drugs.com says Seroquel is used to treat 
schizophrenia and bipolar); Wellbutrin (bupropion) net says is an antidepressant; aripiprazole (net says Aripiprazole is an anti-psychotic used to treat psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder and major depressive disorder. ) (New question B: Why is she putting you on two anti-psychotics when your diagnosis is depression? And for 20 years, you were doing OK on only one medicine, an anti-depressant, EffexorER? She also had newly put you on an anti-depressant, Wellbutrin? For a total of 3 meds, two of them new, after taking you off EffexorER, on which you had functioned for 20 years?) (New Question C: What happened when this doctor took you off EffexorER? “I would drive to the clinic yelling at the front desk staff to tell my Dr that she had to do something or I was going to lose my mind.” And “I literally lost my mind.”) 7. The Dr places me back on EffexorER (anti-depressant) added adderall (net says Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine stimulan
ts for… hyperactivity. 8. and (she added another medicine) Risperidone (net says is an antipsychotic medicine used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 9. So for your depresson, she now has you on the same anti-depressant you had been on for 20 years and were doing OK, plus she adds an anti- psychotic and Adderal, which net says is an amphetamine with dextroamophetamine which net says (adf.org.) “Amphetamines are stimulant drugs, which means they speed up the messages travelling between the brain and the body.” Then she diagnosis you as bipolar, which if you are, the Adderall would seem to speed you up and could throw you into a mania, especially if you don’t have a stabilizer like Lithium, which is what I take as a bipolar to calm down the anti-depressant, which for me is Mirtazapine. (New Question D: And if she thinks you are bipolar, why aren’t you on a stabilizer?) (New Question E: Why if you are bipolar, why don't you have any of the symptoms? Which we've already discussed and you agree 
with.) 12. I’m just wondering if I should be getting a second opinion or if there’s a chance that I have it and the meds I’m on now are what I needed to balance me out. I gave you a second opinion and you didn’t seem to appreciate it. (New question F: Can you get a new doctor?)"
175908999,Yeah I know. I’ve been through quite a few myself. Best caseworker ever.
175909000,"I'm listening to ""Jelly Roll"". Really helping me."
174330969,"I genuinely think that the most misunderstood people with mental illness are those who have schizophrenia. Because we have to or we have developed certain ways of doing things, or getting things done, due to our patterns of disrupted healthy mental processing."
175909001,Quetiapine was a torture for me. I got restless leg syndrome from it and was drowsy AF. Didnt manage even work on it. Was also really agitated
175909002,"As long as it stopped burning, it should heal pretty quickly. What kind of face lotion did you use?"
175909003,I have an idea that we face these issues of being a little down about ourselves because it is Sunday evening and we are reflecting on our lives. I think I understand your sentiment.
175909004,"see you are denying it again , you just refuse to acccept others opinion honestly, you need a sttonger Ap"
175909005,"Definitely, especially seeing that I don’t suffer from paranoia."

175909007,"I see what you mean, but in his whole career he’s bound to have seen a lot of different people and seen what works and what doesn’t. For example, he told me we couldn’t lower the invega sustenna below 75 mgs, because it would stop having a therapeutic effect. I feel like gotta trust him on this one"
175909008,I’m so sorry. It is awful to lose someone.
175909009,Interesting. Maybe The italian way of life also contibrutes. Living with others can be good but personally Living alone is ok.
175909010,So sorry to hear that…some people’s illnesses are truly medication resistant. I hope someday they will evolve more treatment options for folks like you. I wish you all the best
175909011,There goes 30 seconds of my life…
174330956,"I noticed when I was diagnosed at 16. But when I look back, now I can see it started before I was diagnosed. When I was 14 I think. I believed there was another soul attachd to me. He told me to do bad things. He went away eventually. I don’t want to go into detail about what he said he was and what he told me to do because it makes me feel really bad. But that was probably my worst. 14 is also when I started drinking alcohol and smoking weed and doing other recreational drugs. I’m doing a lot better compared to when I was 14. I remember my mother reading through my journals where I wrote about the soul and she punished me. I wasn’t brought to be checked if I was psychotic. I was diagnosed during a psych ward stay. I was in there for wanting to kill myself but then they realized there was something wrong with me."
174330963,Do people with schizophrenia tend to smoke? I curious about that…
175909012,Your friend needs food for strength
175909013,My CPN said he’d do this every day if he had to. Do you have a case manager that could help? Maybe a nearby pharmacy could help you out if the doctor requests it? Perhaps get on a depot?
175909014,And I've now taken my prescribed today.

175909019,So I have read my five pages for today and I have just read the preliminary physical exercises described in the book. I want to spend a week doing these exercises every day before I continue reading. To do this I will have to clear a space in my room. Tomorrow is the 25th of December and I will be spending the day with my parents. I will start doing the physical exercises on the 26th till the 2nd and then continue reading my book. Thank you.
175909020,why would u suddenly become psychotics
175909021,getting the right dx is something that keeps going on. I think it’s hard to dx especially since you seeing different pdocs all the time too. If you think your dx is wrong then talk about it with your pdoc.
175909022,"Wondering about my meds. My anxiety has been extremely high but I don’t know if that’s because of the current situation or it just is for no reason. I’ll have to ask my doctor. I have klonopin, I’m prescribed to take it 2 times a day, morning and evening. But I haven’t been taking it because I always worry about depending on it but maybe I should start taking it. At least for now"
175909023,"You’re not lazy and you’re certainly not stupid. You have limitations, maybe more limitations than others. But they’re not your fault, and you’re trying your best. Don’t be so hard on yourself."
175909024,I’m sorry. Trying to sleep with chronic pain is so hard. As in already existing insomnia and it’s even worse. It sucks. Can you do physically therapy for your knee?
175909025,I agree that your better off without it. I took Ativan for years and came off it by switching to diazepam and lowering the dose gradually. It took about 2 years to come off it.

175909029,"When I draw I try to do many things. I don’t ever try to be too good, never erase, make things out of place on purpose and natural. If I get bored I change to another technique immediately. The meaning of the picture may change as I draw, like dreams, but has a cohesive meaning in the end like it had been planned. Never criticize the picture, draw like I’m God and can’t fail to make a living creation. Realize every single scribble has a meaning. Spend a lot of time on it and it’ll be good. I try to make it possible for people to see things as I do."
175909030,"I took the WAIS IQ test and scored 69. I’m very happy with this score though.

174330974,"Recently, our researchers used gene technology to identify several mechanisms in the brain that are not targeted by current schizophrenia treatments but are part of the underlying disease biology. With this knowledge, our researchers have been able to conduct research using gene-modified mice with the same DNA-mutations found in schizophrenia patients. This breakthrough could point us to new targets. To that end, last year we formed a research partnership with Vanderbilt University to explore novel approaches to treating schizophrenia. For example, the partnership is examining ways to address the issue of having too much dopamine in the brain by reducing dopamine release. This would represent a different approach compared with existing treatments that primarily focus on blocking the dopamine receptors in the brain. Wondering how that Vanderbilt drug is doing."

175909035,"If I wouldn’t be smoking I would lay too in bed the whole day and the whole night, just standing up for toilette and something to eat and drink. But I don’t like smoking anymore. The hard reality of staying awake and doing something is putting me down, so I grab a smoke. I remember the time where I would go to buy food three times a week but stay in bed 90% of the time. I did not stop laying in bed even when it hurt badly. But I don’t have anything left, there is no reason to live. And I’m not doing life for myself as I see."

174330966,I had this very severe delusion that some people were trying to harm me at university. I didn’t get help because I thought it was true and that I had to hide from them in my dorm. I focused completely on the delusion. I think I became very psychotic.

Its done I died a million times before. I cant do that again. If this wound has taught me One single lesson It is that not letting go Kills me slowly Until i can’t die one more time.

When your life is trashed by this illness, all you can do is try not to take life so seriously anymore. What would you prefer they say to you, if they want to help? I tend to accept that some people simply can’t be helped, and so you have to just let them suffer. But it’s painful knowing that they’re suffering and you’re not."

I’ve tried everything I can think of over the years to make it work, but I can only take limited exposure at best (e.g. photographing a wedding or DJing a reception) and boy oh boy do I pay for it later. I might make it through two days, but an entire semester in school? _PERSON_, tovarisch. So, yeah, I’ve got limitations. It would be fair to say I suffer from social disabilities. Other aspects of my _PERSON_’s allow me to chew up and spit out NTs with ease at work. I’m fairly obviously the most capable member of my own team at my job (manager excepted, she’s amazing). I’m kicking the butts of NTs with 20 years more experience than I have, but I learn faster and organize better than they do. It balances out. No complaints."

175909074,Yes I did. I figured I had severe chronic depression from my dad isolating me and my parents and from not having friends and from being poor. My parents were middle class or better but the money never trickled down to me. I wonder if that’s common. I was a cheap commodity. I probably had bipolar type 2 growing up combined with mild Aspergers. I wonder if the Aspergers is even real now given that my whole life has been a lie.

I hate being stuck in a car. The thing is that since I came back I have had really bad anxiety. I think maybe pretending all is fine for a week and all smiles just makes me so tired. I have had diarrhea every day, my chest and back hurt and I feel so exhausted. Sometimes I just feel like crying. For other people this time would have been great and I feel so frustrated that it was just draining for me. Do you have this same type of experience when your routine is altered?

175909195,"well i don’t know, i think the whole thing, being a defendent, while i was being prosecuted and defended would cause me much anxiety. i don’t know if i could go through with a jury trial, and would probably take a plea deal. although i guess, it depends on the severity of the charges and my guilt or innocence, but the whole thing seems like hell. just my every 6 month hearings about meds i hate and dread. one time, when i was hospitalized, i had to go to court, to see if they would let me out or if i had to stay a whole month. during the hearing, they had an expert testify about my mental state, and also a group of school kids came in and witnessed the trial. it was so embarrasing, and then at the end of it, they asked me if i wanted to address the children about my future plans. i was so pissed they were there in the first place and told them i didn’t want to speak to the kids. i was in the hospital, because i was caught walking back on forth on a median in the middle of the road, after i go

Numbers in first part of “giant egg” - 5 and 23 - have sum 28 , like numbers 21 and 7 and larger number in 5, 23 starts with digit 2, like larger number in 21 7. Sum of digits in 5, 23 is the same as sum of digits in 21 7. Both doubles consist of three digits. Number in second part of “giant egg” ( 421 ) has sum of digit 7 (and 7 is also the sum of digit in 12 4) and has three the same digits as phrase 12 4! Sum of digits in 11, 23, 47, 83, 131, 191, 263 is 56 and 56 is (7x7)+7 , in that phrase there are three digits 7 forming constant arithmetic and geometric sequence with sum of numbers 21. Sum of seven numbers mentioned earlier is 749. From 749 numbers 7 and 49 can be separated. 7 is 7 , 49 is 7x7 . So we have numbers associated with three 7s (which

In such cases restraints can be necessary to protect others. You can also overdo things though…4 point restraints for picking at stitches or isolation for a quiet prayer felt like aggression too. There was also a news item in my country where they showed a mentally disabled teen who had literally been chained to a wall in a tiny, dark isolation room for three years because staff was scared of him. His mum eventually went to the press with video recordings. Then the boy was released to another institution, and there was a lot of discussion. They quickly got him so much better that they filmed him taking walks in the sun and happily chatting. This kind of restraint imho is medieval."

Now I’ve been feeling this vibrating in other areas and seeing these suspicious looking people in jackets more than I’ve seen them in weeks, and it was freezing cold today so there’s no reason all these people should just be out when they haven’t been for so long.

174331020,"If you think that all you need is the right medication to take care of all your emotions and feelings, then it will take a lot longer to get better. If you are aware of the fact that you don’t want to take a shower, then why don’t you get up, and go take a shower? You seem very aware of what your abilities are, despite the fact that you choose not to do anything about it. You sound an awful like one of my children. They can play video games, but they can’t take a shower or do their chores. You gotta make yourself take care of yourself, or it won’t happen. I have schizophrenia, and negative symptoms up the wazoo. I’ve had both negative and positive. But at the end of the day, when I realize that I don’t want to take a shower, it’s not because I have apathy, it’s because I don’t want to be bothered. You gotta find something in your life to drive you, otherwise you will just end up spinning your wheels and getting nowhere in life. I was in the middle of college when I was diagnosed. 
I was becoming very depressed, didn’t want to do anything, etc. I had to take a year off. Once I got on meds, I didn’t want to be a college drop out, so I went back to school, finished my degree, got a full time job and then lived on my own before getting married. Was my life very difficult? Absolutely. Did I just want to sit around at my parent’s house eating chips all day? Absolutely. But I wanted to better myself, despite what I was going through. I got through it all. And it was tough!!! This is what I’m trying to tell you.The medication will help your chemical imbalance, but you still got to give life 100% effort, or you will be stuck in a life not going anywhere or doing anything. You don’t have to accomplish everything in life, I just suggest that you create a list of all the things you want to do in your life, and make steps to achieve what you want. You can do it. Life is always going to be hard, especially with a mental illness, but it’s not impossible to be happy in the end."

175909281,Its psychosis. No one can see hell.
174331019,I am refusing the Rexulti the pdr is offering. He doesn’t know the hell I was in because of Abilify. I don’t want my personality to be worse. I will take Zyprexa for the mean time that Vraylar comes out by end of this year. It shouldn’t cause weight gain or metabolic issues if only taken for 2-3 months. I already gained weight now on Risperdal so I don’t mind gaining a couple of pounds. I had slightly less negative symptoms and slightly more energy on Zyprexa in the past.

175909285,"I saw my Regular T last night. I think I scared her because of the sui attempt. She seemed really upset. I feel kind of bad. I didn't really think it would affect her. I kind of feel like a horrible person. She made me promise to call her next time, even if it is like 3 AM. And she made me Possible trigger: promise to give my extra medications to someone who would hold them for me and to tell her the name of the person that I was going to ask to do that. So I went to the parking lot after the appointment and I called a friend of mine, and I asked her if she would hold the medications for me. She questioned me a bit but she is going to hold them. So I arranged to go over there today after work. I feel stupid and embarrassed though. =( Then this morning I was having hallucinations. Sheesh! I don't feel all that stable."

175909290,"That sounds awful, I hope you feel better soon and have less stress coming to you! Also have you ever tried lucid dreaming? I used to have nightmares all the time and when I tried it I stood up to the things that were scaring me and they went away. I have them much less often now cause I basically told them to f off. Maybe that could help you too?"

These obsessions grew more and more, with no way to express them I was stuck in constant anxiety and torture. Until I found art I expressed everything I could in to that all my fantasies and dreams into a journal that would never tell a soul, it became so fun I started an IG, YouTube, and a Twitter dedicated to my antics it was so fun I forgot I was even sick. Fast forward to 2017-18 I just got out of the hospital with Zyprexa, I gained a bunch of weight I hated it, made me sleep and made me eat so much a day would be a max of 4000 calories, the worst part being I didn’t have no motivation or creativity to start on my journal and videos, I was depleted of any creativity thanks to Zyprexa.

They say there’s more money in keeping people sick. If they had a cure, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was shelved. They say it’s extremely hard to find one, yet it seems we have made strides when it comes to other fields like technology and physics… I’ve always thought the easiest way to get the cure is to go to the future and then come back in a time machine lol. They say that’s harder than coming up with the cure."

175909306,Tell them you’re experiencing Rapture and ask them if Jesus is their personal savior. Best way I’ve found to stop any conversation I don’t want to have from starting. People usually disappear with a little poof of dust like in the old Road Runner 'toons. (I actually do this.)

175909308,I’ve had good ones and bad ones. Never any psychiatrists. I’ve been lucky with that but general practitioners I’ve had a couple of really bad ones and that is on general health. Psychiatry is an art at any level these days. What meds work for some won’t work for another and getting people to wellness takes some time and effort in a system where 15 minute appointments are common at least over here! If your not getting joy. Get a second opinion if possible. Especially if your paying. I know it’s a stuffed up system but there’s some really good people out there doing their best in mental health and I’m glad I’ve run into them!
174331029,They should make better meds for you as Clozapine doesnt seem to be fully working. You said you keep having positive symptoms.
174331036,I don’t really know if Amyloban is working 100%. Today I took 2 pills and I still feel very slightly like there are times when I’m not completely recovered and not right in the head. Has the effects of Amyloban ever “worn off” for anybody in terms of positive symptoms? I feel like I am still getting very mild delusions of reference…
175909309,"Oh well that’s good you have that much control over your meds. I was on Risperdal for 3 years, and I didn’t slur my words, just became heavily sedated. I took up to 12mg. Clonazapam on the other hand, made me slur my words, and talk like I had a whiny voice, so I feel your pain."

174331034,"Thank you for sharing. This is helpful to me. I am not schizophrenic but I get really paranoid, so, it is nice to speak to someone (you, _AT_MENTION_ ) who seems to me to be in part unrealistically paranoid, and in so doing realise that I am being in part unrealistic also. There are so many layers to this! It is difficult to know where to start. Like, I find it entirely plausible that your old work colleague is a “deranged” “psychopath.” Yeah, I bet he is. But… Like most (all?) of the other posters on this thread, I also feel that your fears are almost entirely unrealistic. Even if we, are right, would be, it is, very difficult to persuade you (or me) to chill. Why is this? What can be done? Someone said on another thread here on these forums that one should consider the rich. If you believe in some conspiracy then you should also apply it to the case of rich people. I can’t remember the examples but perhaps, if you believe that the end is nigh, that there are radio waves that cause can
cer unless you are wearing a tin hat, then you should consider whether very rich people e.g. _NAME_ or the _PERSON_ are living like there is no tomorrow or wearing tin hats, or covert tin hats, such as tin wigs. l think that other people behave in fairly epicurean, homo-economicus ways. I will come back to that. Another thing is that there are all sorts of ways of being deranged. There is a book full of mental health problems. To mention but three: stalker, psychopath and schizophrenic (which are sometimes blended), reactions would vary. If your ex-colleague is a psychopath, and does not feel the same emotions and reactions of disgust to the breaking of bones and the stabbing of flesh, then I could believe that he enjoys doing the things that normal people only indulge in porn or violent video games. If your ex-colleague were an x-romantic partner, then I could easily believe that he were driving 45 minutes to stalk you. But if your ex-colleague were schizophrenic I would believe that he fantasised that he wa
s being followed by the _NAME_, which is how I interpret your circumstances. Before I try and figure out why this is, hold on a second! Are you sure that your dad (not your mum I presume) and your ex-colleague are _NAME_ members? No one seems to be taking exception to your assertion that your parent and your ex-colleague are both members of a secret army! This is amazing, horrific, or lit. There are loads of posts about other secret armed personnel, the CIA and the FBI but almost all of them are assumed imho to be complete fantasy. Assuming you are right, this fact might make it difficult to understand your position. My dad was a picture restore. The highlight of his work related anecdote was perhaps “I found that the moustache on the picture of someone’s great granddad was painted in after, and cleaned it off, but the gallery told me to paint it back in. Don’t tell anyone son.” Which is a far cry from “I am going to London to blow up some bandsmen. Don’t tell anyone son.” I can not imaging the 
trauma that living with an _NAME_ member must have caused. By the way, talk of the _NAME_ reminds me of my youth, a bygone era. I will have to think about this more."
175909320,i’m not really doing anything constructive or productive during the lockdown. I watch movies and tv series with my dad… besides that i play some “truck driver” on the switch and i listen music on my record player and reading the forum here of course =3

I’d love to go back on Vraylar but my insurance won’t cover it even with a pre auth and I’m not sure my current income bracket would qualify for the patient assistance. I looked it up and it would cost me about $1500 a month and thats obviously not doable. If I could just get a decent nights sleep I think things would improve but with the PTSD, the nightmares, the restlessness, the inability to fall asleep, plus the hallucinations I’m experiencing at night I’m not sure what else to do at this point. I just want everything to be done with. Over. I’m tired of living right now. My parents aren’t showing much support, they don’t even know I’m back on medication in the first place.

do it again they’ll be disappointed. i just don’t know what i’m doing and sometimes when i think about my future i cant even envision one. i’m just so mentally stressed and exhausted that i just want to pack up and start a whole new life somewhere. just wanted to express how i’ve been feeling, if you have any words of wisdom to share, please do!"

175909426,"Dont really have too much to suggest, mostly just wanted to know if youll be ok long term. However Id say knowing what to do if this happens again would be helpful, as in a plan for who to call (ie your husband, your counselor) and what to say (like ""Im having a panic attack please help me at [address, which btw you should have handy ahead of time wherever you are in case this happens]), and most importantly have it written down and on you at all times, that way its concrete and you cant blank on it when youre having an attack. This has personally saved me multiple times. It sucks to have to do this but when youre mentally ill you have to accomodate that unfortunately.

There are techniques and knowledge and support out here in the world and you will feel better the longer you seek it out. Number 1 tip: stay away from people who invalidate you or try to tell you to get over it. Facebook has a bunch of groups for trauma support or abusive relationship support. Memories are hard, our brain is powerful as heck. But if our brains can seem to work so hard AGAINST us, we can work with our brains to make us happy and free from the pain of our past!!!

I was advised by several different people (my husband included) to read the book because it gives a good understanding of the state of depression, anxiety, mood swings and all other mental health issues we might experience throughout our lives. It is written by a psychiatrist so it is not just a self-help book but a serious review of what depression is and how we can overcome it."

175909458,Fried eggs are probably the easiest but my favorite is scrambled. However when I was on my own I used a method my Mom’s boyfriend at the time taught me by cooking it in a plastic bowl in the microwave using cooking oil to keep it from sticking. I cooked scrambled eggs growing up in a pan and it’s takes a few minutes to do depending on how high you turn up the heat. The main thing is to cook the entire yoke without burning it. Of course with fried eggs all you have to do is cook it like a pancake. I never did it but it looks easier.

175909466,"O.k. Story. One Night as I Was Typing And Etching, Thinking About The Next Song to Sing Along With. The Next Song I Felt Like Writing. So on And Such And So on. I Had a Voice That Introduced Herself to Me. She Was a New One. Excited, as if Something Above Her Gave Her Permission to Expose Her Existence to Me. I Was Excited Also. Cause You See, I Hadn’t Talked to a Girl (Outside of The Clinic) For a Very Long Time. But She Chatted And Chatted And Chatted. I Worked And Listened. And Worked And Listened. One Late Night, I Was Sitting at The Computer And Decided to Get Some Proof That Thus New Voice Was Actually Outside of My Self Being Made up of Self. So I Asked, ‘What’s Your Name so I Can Have a Face to Your Voice’. Ya’know, What if Thus Voice is a Ghost?. Of Someone Long Ago. Maybe Recent. I NEED PROOF, I’m Not Going Out of My Mind, And That I Am The Reason Nothing Works in My Life. With The Plan to Put Her Name into Google Images And Wait For Her to Let Me Know When I Find Her Picture. 
N e Hoo, She Laughed And Said, ‘BLUBIRD!, MY NICKNAME IS BLUBIRD*’. (That Spelling Came From an Etching Evolution as Time Passed). So I Laughed And Was Like FINALLY (!!!)…, So I Typed in |||Blue Bird||| . And Well, My Computer Screen Filled Up With Blue Birds. I Paused. And Laughed. And Said to Myself, ‘THERE . IS . NO . WAY . MY . BRAIN . CAN . FOOL . ME . LIKE . THAT’. That is IMPOSSIBLE. Plus it Came From Out of Nowhere it Was Assurance That Something Maybe Even Mystical (OR) Magical is Happening. As Odd as That May Seem. N e Hoo. One of My Voices. BLUBIRD (!!!).

But like this, I am less ‘‘crazy’’ too tbh and the bigger doses before was an obstacle to progress for me, believe me… I couldn’t even move after the take of the 10 mgs, this is too much, no way… The bigger doses also were suppressing my appetite, not the opposite which it was supposed to do (I am on Zyprexa)… It was clear something was wrong with me on the bigger doses… And I had more of my somatic bad sensations on the bigger doses… Now sometimes the pain is quite strong, but ill try to see if it can go away… Maybe I should accept some suffering meanwhile?.. Cause lets be honest, I really don’t believe lots of schizophrenics went completely free from symptoms only by the meds… In fact, my symptoms are on the both sides - paranoia and negatives… If I heal my paranoia, my negatives become worse and if I heal 
my negatives, I get way too anxious, paranoid, excited… So in a way, I should balance this with some other methods…"

174331068,"_AT_MENTION_ These are the major meds in phase 2 and 3 development. There are others, like cannabidiol, and existing meds being repurposed (like Exenatide, Raloxifene, simvastatin, tocilzumab, stiltuximab) Vanderbilt/Lundbeck?s apparently unnamed drug, Reviva?s RP-5063 which seems to have stalled out, and dietary supplements like NAC and suforaphane not covered here. And there are more in phase 1, but there?s too little info to make listing those worthwhile. Intracellular Theraputic?s Lumateperone (ITI-007) Mechanism : 5-HT2A receptor antagonist partial agonist of presynaptic D2 receptors and an antagonist of postsynaptic D2 receptors serotonin transporter blocker affinity for the D1 receptor and lower affinity for the Alpha-1A_adrenergic_receptor and Alpha-1B_adrenergic_receptor 5-HT2C receptor and D4 receptor, indirect glutamatergic modulation Phase: Completed phase 3, submitted to FDA for approval What?s it for? antipsychotic What?s so great about it? : Better, safer side effect profile. Possibl
e benefits for disrupted sleep patterns and negative symptoms. _NAME_?s Roluperidone (MIN-101) Mechanism : 5-HT2A and sigma-2 receptor antagonist Phase: In the midst of phase 3, study to end about March 2020. Topline results from double-blind expected in 2019. What?s it for?: Negative, and perhaps positive symptoms of schizophrenia What?s so great about it?: Potentially the first medication for negative symptoms. Side effect profile looks good. Company believes it may be useful for positive symptoms as well, and may be ?disease modifying.? Newron?s Evenamide Mechanism: glutamate modulation and voltage-gated sodium channel blockade Phase: Company says they will begin phase 3 in the 2nd quarter of 2019 (that would be by the end of June) What?s it for?: Add-on for the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia What?s so great about it?: No dopaminergic side effects (weight gain, sexual, cardiac, extrapyramidal). 75% of the treatment group in phase 2 responded to it. It may be useful in treatment 
resistant schizophrenia, or for people with an insufficient response to antispychotics. SyneuRx?s Naben Mechanism: : D amino acid oxidase inhibition May increase levels of D-serine in the brain Phase: Combined Phase2/3 scheduled for completion June 30, 2019 What?s it for?: cognition and negative symptoms What?s so great about it?: An add-on of a well tolerated/generally recognized as safe food preservative may improve cognition and negative symptoms Sunovion?s SEP-363856 Mechanism: Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, SEP-363856 is believed to activate TAAR1 (trace amine-associated receptor 1) in addition to 5-HT1A (serotonin 1A) receptors. Phase: Completed phase 2 and has been awarded ?Breakthrough Therapy? designation by FDA. What?s it for: Positive and negative symptoms What?s so great about it?: Novel, non D2 mechanism. May treat negative and positive symptoms. Good safety profile. Karuna?s KarXt Mechanism: M1/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist plus a blocking agent to prevent swea
ting and gastro side effects. Phase: Phase 2 expected to be completed in November 2019 What?s it for?: Preclinically (in mice) it improves positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Whether or not this translates to people is unknown, but it was effective on cognition in humans with Alzheimer?s. The addition of the tropsium chloride blocker could reduce or eliminate the worst side effects. Astella Pharma?s ASP-4345 Mechanism: Undefined Phase: Phase 2 to be completed December 2019 What?s it for?: The primary indication is for cognition. It would be an add-on to antipsychotics. _PERSON_?s BI 425809 Mechanism: GlyT1 inhibitor Phase: Phase 2 to be completed February 2020 What?s it for?: Treating cognitive impairment Takeda?s TAK-831 Mechanism: D amino acid oxidase inhibitor Phase: Phase 2 scheduled to complete in April 2020 What?s it for?: negative symptoms and cognitive impairment _PERSON_?s RO6889450 Mechanism: Undefined Phase: Phase 2 scheduled to be completed July 2020 What?s it for?: Negative symptoms Bioge
n?s BIIB-104 Mechanism: positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the AMPA receptor Phase: Phase 2 scheduled to be complted April 2020 What?s it for?: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia Notes: Companies plan an end date to their trials, but often they end up getting extended. Timelines: It typically takes 2-3 years for a phase 3 study, and the FDA 9 months to a year for review, if there were positive results. Phase 2 can take around 2 years, it can vary. There is often significant time in between the phases as the companies strategize, raise capital, analyze data, etc."

175909617,"Went to bed at around 6pm (~26 hours awake). Woke up at 3:30am. I'm gonna have a coffee, chew nicotine gum for focus and take a Vyvanse 50mg at 8-9am and then sleep at 11pm-12am tonight. I'm not taking extra anymore. Dopamine desensitivity makes sleep paralysis worse - I was walking around the house in empty rooms which made me realize that I was still dreaming. Sleep paralysis is a GABA thing but also can be worse if lack of dopamine is involved. What I got out of these dreams is that my mom could have a much better life - Not so stressed out. I'm afraid that her heart condition and cancer will kill her. I learned that I should drink less coca cola and also read books more. I said I would read books often if I wake up from sleep paralysis because I gave up hope on trying to wake up - It was like lifting weights just trying to move my arm. Taking a very low dose of phenibut today and let it clear my system. I took temazepam and a zopiclone to sleep at 6pm because I was getting ""micro sleeps"" wher
e I wouldn't remember anything for a few seconds like glitches in the matrix. It was sort of a relapse but I'm going to get back on track again. I hope my doctor forgives me - I'll bring the rest of the Vyvanse (40mg's) back to the pharmacy."

174331094,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Instrumental rationality and suicide in schizophrenia: a case for rational suicide? _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of medical ethics , Aug 2019 08 It is estimated that up to 7500 people develop schizophrenia each year in the UK. Schizophrenia has significant consequences, with 28% of the excess mortality in schizophrenia being attributed to suicide. Previous research suggests that suicide in schizophrenia may be more related to affective factors such as depression and hopelessness, rather than psychotic symptoms themselves. Considering suicide in schizophrenia within this framework enables us to develop a novel philosophical approach, in which suicide may not be related to loss of self-consciousness, thought processing dysfunctions or perception disturbances. The action of suicide may be due neither to persistent hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, but to other underexamined, perhaps rational reasons, such as extreme social isolation, 
severe depression or emotional withdrawal. This paper does not examine the moral character of suicide. Instead, it argues that we should conceive the action of suicide in schizophrenia as an act that is not necessarily irrational. People with schizophrenia might end their life based on reasons if suicide is the best means to achieve their ends. However, the paper does not support assisted suicide. It aims to provide a better understanding of the reasons why people take their own lives and suggests that understanding can inform effective interventions to reduce high rates of suicide."

Every time I try to think good of myself, no one understands and must inflict pain on me, judges me or looks down on me. I'm not a real person. I'm an entity. I have no worth. I don't want to have worth anyways. I wish I was dead. Maybe I already am dead and I'm just floating through space, hallucinating everything possible. I'm a God and can do what ever I please - Except for pain and suffering which makes me conform. People are a lot worse off than I am. People do great things with their minds - But what's the point for me? I need to take control but I have nothing to rely on - No solid foundation of convictions.

I wonder how everyone is doing/dealing with the physical symptoms of anxiety. I am taking only 0.25 mg of klonopin to help and it does most of the time but I do not want to become fully dependent.

I believe people have the freedom to ruin their own lives, and should be given the encouragement and resources to better them. Let her sink or swim on her own motives. If its a waste of time or emotional stress, let her show that to you, and then decline after you’ve given her the opportunity. If you think you’re about to be abused for her personal gain, I say cut ties. This is your life, live it.

175909761,"_AT_MENTION_: thank you very much, I appreciate your answer. Usually, I am respected by people around, and I choose them carefully. The problem is to get a sincere answer by them. It occurs when I know a new, potential friend: people hesitate to express possible criticisms to extraneous. It's a social etiquette, usually I don't care (it's even better to live “quietly”). But I care, if I am interested in deepening the knowledge! If I haven't a clear feedback, I get confused. For example: I meet my new, potential friend on the street; he is with someone else, that I still don't know. We start chatting, it's very pleasant, then I say: “let's go to the restaurant together!”. Later, I suspect from some details that they would have preferred to dinner alone. But if I ask my new friend: “was I inopportune?”... it's unlikely that he answers “yes, you were inopportune!"". And so, you can't know what the truth is, and you can't regulate your behaviour. -- 02 Jul 2020, 10:07 -- I am able to expr
ess criticism to people, and they usually accept them. I am the kind of person that can express almost everything, even bad things, and people don't get offended: I am very diplomatic, tactful, and so on. It's successful, because I express myself and people don't go away. The negative side is that it's tiring and stressful. I am not able to be “brutally direct” and to succeed, as you do. I need flourishes, zigzag, embellishments and so on, to express negative thoughts. I can't understand if the problem is mistrust (“people won't accept a direct communication”), if I fear to lose control and become more hostile than I wish, or if I select the wrong people for that kind of communication... Absolutely, I want to try this."

I often have a nap after the morning…30 minutes tops but so refreshing… It’s all about routine. Take meds same time. Sleep same time. Get up same time. It really does make a difference!
175909765,"I work four days a week. I only started working after diagnosis because my family offered me a job somewhere safe, and I was homeless and had waited 6 months and not received any benefits. In the end it was the right decision. I was worse off not having something to focus on."

175909800,"So my ""mind rests"" are called ""open awareness meditation"". There isn't nearly as much information about it on the internet as ""mindfulness meditation"". People want to be able to do open awareness meditation but they have to practice mindfulness meditation a lot in order to get where I'm at - And I do it for an hour every day. I've been doing it for years every day - It could be because of the psychedelics and the Vyvanse.. I thought there was something really wrong with me.. Maybe there is idk.. Need more research.. I can focus but I'd rather let my mind drift and observe in the moment without trying to control anything. The ketamine made me realize that I WANT to BE my thoughts instead of LOOKING AT them. I was reading a book called ""Autopilot"" and it was saying that the greatest inventors basically did nothing to lead to their discoveries because the mind is more active when you aren't multitasking. Idk.. It could be a reason as to why I'm so calm and not anxious and not depressed as befo
re. I should really start writing about this stuff.. Job is right - I have a lot of insight about this.. Just one problem: I feel like I'm not ready to write a book or anything.. I feel like - Once I'm older (1-2 years), I'll have more information and everything will be pieced together.. But I've always wondered why people do amazing things when they're young... Because the journey of figuring things out is expressed from the beginning to the peak.. And it just gets better with age. I feel sometimes afraid and jinxed when I'm aware that I know I'm new to something - Because I could chose so many things - ""What if I fail?"".. Fear of failure is one of the biggest reasons as to why people don't try.. My dad says that I should write... I just never read that many books in my life but I collect information in others ways.. My brain is always so active. I have my moments where I freak out, lose control etc but I always feel better afterwards... It's like those moments need to happen."
175909801,What has your doctor said? I mean your meds should help a lot
175909802,"What you have to try is, and I know it’s a lot easier said than done, is to find self acceptance through confidence. You have to treat yourself so that you accept yourself. If the feeling persists that you feel not good enough I would look to get some help from books. There are a lot of books out there on the subject of self confidence and similar themes. I am reading some now. I have already come across some tips I can put to use."
175909803,"Hugs. Lowering meds can cause mood swings just because of the withdrawal. If it doesn’t get overwhelming, it could be temporary. You might just need to wait it out. I know you really want to be off depakote because of the health issues. Just keep in touch with your doctor and use grounding techniques as much as you can. The crisis text line is good for having someone coach you through a grounding technique. I text them when I’m having a panic attack, and they are able to guide me through it until I feel more in control. They arenct just for suicidal episodes. It is 741-741."
175909804,It’s just brain chemistry gone wrong unfortunately. Nothing to do with psychology.

175909826,"en.m.wikipedia.org History of condoms The history of condoms goes back at least several centuries, and perhaps beyond. For most of their history, condoms have been used both as a method of birth control, and as a protective measure against sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties. Rubber condoms gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th centu..."

I tried looking back on my posts to see what the difference is before and after my Invega injection. I seem calmer and freaking out less. But what I notice at the end of the injection is that I feel a little manic. My dad said that during the past few days after my injection, I seemed more withdrawn from people - keeping more to myself. I feel really good right now though. This is the second day that I've felt good. I'm 1/3 into the injection. This is the absolute perfect dose in my blood."

I know that the World depends on people to work, and you have to understand that the _USER_ID_ from us not working or in your case perhaps not working full time is partially due to a need for survival of humanity. Yet if you are not able to do your job right or without medical care that costs more than you’ll ever make then you really have little choice in the matter.

I guess helpful though, was another takeaway in navigating online communication was that “The written word is only 7% of the message.” [Voice over the phone] was only like 18% of the message… while non verbal cues, being interpersonal, was the remainder!"

175909898,"I see people claiming they’re asexual, or don’t like sex or think it’s disgusting and I’m not judging. Personally at age 58 and being just average looking. I was thinking, man, maybe these asexual’s have a point. Maybe I should throw in the towel and make a decision to give up on ever having sex again. Because what’s the big deal about it anyways? It’s hard to get (I’m single), and takes a lot of effort and only lasts 10 minutes to an hour anyways so why bother? But I just can’t quit. I’m 58 but I still get that rush, even at my age, when a woman flirts a little with me or some gorgeous woman in a supermarket knows I’m checking her out and she smiles. Or like after work last week, a cute, just really nice woman soldier gave me the friendliest look. Hey, I’m no prize but there’s literally millions of people around the world at any given moment who are having sex. Like my title says, looks are a big help but they are not mandatory for getting sex. Just the law of averages sa
ys everybody will get laid sometime. And I haven’t had it in years but the other day at work this woman who is kind of my boss, smiled at me and seductively said “_PERSON_.” My first thought was that she was teasing me and being mean. But when I got outside to my car a little part of me wondered, "" Hey, most guys would not find her attractive but I sure do. Maybe there’s a one in a million shot that she realized I was attracted to her and she was being nice."" It happens. But it ain’t important if she didn’t like me, at least I got that tingly rush of excitement and I’m happy for it. IDK. Just my thoughts on sex. And I just realized I should say that I’m not just looking for a one night stand. I’m not opposed to it, but there’s several woman at work my age who I am friendly with so I wouldn’t be opposed for some kind of fling that might last awhile."

175909901,"Oh yeah, that is significant. How do you speak about it with your doctor? Doctors tend to vary in how much they trust their patients to report symptoms, and you can affect that by being well-spoken, and having a history of medication compliance. How long have you been taking your meds without complaining?"

I think it would have to be thoroughly regulated, and it should be off the table for anyone with a developmental disability, but I would be a lot more comfortable getting older if I had the option of checking out if things get to a point where I’m treatment resistant (I already have tried over a dozen meds that either didn’t work or made me worse. We’re pretty much down to whatever they come up with next.) and losing all my relationships. I’d rather die in good standing with my family."

Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

174331179,"In a recent report based on a 40-year study of roughly 1.2 million Swedish people, _PERSON_ et al. (2013) found that those in scientific and artistic occupations were not more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders, with the exception of bipolar disorders. So full-blown mental illness did not increase the probability of entering a creative profession (even the exception, bipolar disorder, showed only a small effect of 8%). What was striking, however, was that the siblings of patients with autism and the first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia were significantly overrepresented in creative professions. Could it be that the relatives inherited a watered-down version of the mental illness conducive to creativity while avoiding the aspects that are debilitating? Research shows that psychologically healthy biological relatives of people with schizophrenia have unusually creative jobs and hobbies and tend to show higher levels of schizotypal personality traits compared to the general p
opulation (_PERSON_, 1970; _PERSON_, 2001). Schizotypy consists of a constellation of personality traits that are evident to some degree in everyone. Schizotypal traits can be broken down into two types. “Positive” schizotypy includes unusual perceptual experiences, thin mental boundaries between self and other, impulsive nonconformity, and magical beliefs. “Negative” schizotypal traits include cognitive disorganization and physical and social anhedonia (difficulty experiencing pleasure from social interactions and activities that are enjoyable for most people). _PERSON_ (2006) found that people with schizotypy typically resemble schizophrenia patients much more along the positive schizotypal dimensions (such as unusual experiences) compared to the negative schizotypal dimensions (such as lack of affect and volition). This has important implications for creativity. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ (2008) found that the unusual experiences and impulsive nonconformity dimensions of schizotypy, but not the cognitiv
e disorganization dimension, were significantly related to self-ratings of creativity, a creative personality (measured by a checklist of adjectives such as “confident,” “individualistic,” “insightful,” “wide interests,” “original,” “reflective,” “resourceful,” “unconventional,” and “sexy”), and everyday creative achievement among thirty-four activities (“written a short story,” “produced your own website,” “composed a piece of music,” and so forth). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217346/"

174331194,"en.wikipedia.org Fugue state Dissociative fugue, formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder and a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. The state can last days, months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia, accordi Af... No, I did not get this from the television. Did something happen to me in college back in 2010-2011? Personally, I recall coming back alive in a time loop or causal loop or something to the best of my knowledge with little to no memory and severe dissociation. Memory comes back slowly along with paranoia and psychiatric “delusions”. I graduated high school back in 2007 and went to community college in 2007. Then I transferred to a university in 2010 and dropped out in 20
11. I got sick in 2011. I have a lot of fictional identities from TV shows which are obviously not real but I feel they are loosely based on my past lives in parallel universes. I think it’s the illuminati but I’m not sure. I’ve seen aliens and craft too. I cannot work or function and my hygiene is very poor. The APs (only Vraylar supposedly) help as well as ADs and mood stabilizers (only Cymbalta and Lamictal). I’m a chronic smoker and drink energy drinks heavily. Something may have happened in my childhood but I don’t know if it was in this universe or a different one. I keep on reincarnating to a specific year. In a past life, they told me 2013 to say the least. These people were not ordinary people to say the least. I can see and experience my soul (consciousness) reincarnate while it is happening and this has been going on for near eternity. No one believes me except a few aliens or illuminati type people in my other lives. Trying to get help here. Any therapies you guys can recommend or new me
dications? I read art (creative) therapy helps. I have made significant strides to help myself. I don’t think I have DID or MPD. I don’t hear voices but I might have had my personality or mind split from severe trauma like from MK-Ultra or something – not sure if it was in this life or my past lives, but it did happen. Is there a way to stop reincarnating and just move on from this crap or mess? I’m tired of re-living my life as a disabled, paranoid schizophrenic. I hate the mental hospital a lot. It’s a mess and a freaking joke and insult. My biggest dream and hope is to go back to my childhood and live a completely different, better life. One where I never go to the school I transferred to. Maybe live in a different neighborhood or family or state. My biggest regret is not being able to move on and being stuck in the current year (2013) and then reliving my life from that point. If I do have MPD, which I highly doubt, I’ve been living in REAL parallel worlds before 2013 and then traveling back h
ere via mind time travel, which blows. I’m being honest here and I’m not delusional. I guess I was in the real Illuminati in a past life and I’m hoping to escape from this ??????? hell and curse of a life. They told me I’m a vampire, which I’ve explained a thousand times before is someone who can reincarnate and remember their previous life more than the average person. That’s all it means."

175910095,In my case CBT was destroying my brain. Focusing on negative thoughts ( Social Anxiety) was just reinforcing them. I believe these thoughts have combinations with biological and social patterns. They were also being reinforced in this context. I find it better to just think positively and focus on positive memories. They reinforce the related biological and social patterns. I find my way to be very effective. I have almost gotten rid of Social Anxiety.

I’ve only had one visual hallucination and this was at night, I was driving over the train tracks at night and I saw and heard a train with its headlights 20 feet from me. I slammed on my breaks and someone behind me almost hit me. I thought I was going to die, and stupidity hit me and I closed my eyes and braced for impact, when I opened my eyes there was nothing there. That was the only time I had an actual visual hallucination, and I’ve never been more scared in my life."

Maybe I have a negative attitude due to my trauma, because I haven’t really opened up about my mental illness in Korea. I’m just afraid that I will get rejected- maybe my fear is driven by my PTSD and it does not reflect the actual attitudes of the Korean people. _AT_MENTION_ here is a recording of a hymn- I deleted it after posting it on here because I thought it would cause delusions."

Apart of my diagnosis is that I hear god voice and constantly feel a entity that lives inside of me . I’m so fed up with it . I know no ones gonna save me . But I wish it would all end . And most likely that won’t happen so I’m here sitting in the couch crying and no one will proably care about it .

175910101,I wanted to touch on this subject because I don't see much about it here on the forums. I am probably at my highest anxiety right now. I have to have cancer surgery in a little over a week. My anxiety is though the roof. This is how my anxiety manifests itself in me. I have terrible headaches from worrying. I have pain already from degenerative disc disease. Anxiety just makes the pain worse. Last but most painful for me is my whole digestive track. My stomach hurts from morning to evening. After I eat I have a large lump feeling in my stomach. Then as the food passes into my colon I get cramps. In the past three months I have lost twenty pds. I have no appetite to speak of and only eat because my wife is watching me and is upset over how little I eat each day. I have meds for anxiety but until my surgery is over I will just have to push through it all. Also Covid19 is just horrible and it bothers me to no end people are suffering and dying. I wish I could do more than make masks to help. My questio
n is how does anxiety or depression affect your overall health? Is it the same for others as it is for me? I would appreciate any comments. God bless you all
175910102,"I remember my last true hallucination. I was sitting in my back yard under the gazebo vaping, listening to music. In a flash the music cut out and I was in a wheelchair, sitting in a hallway, blueish gray walls with crown molding, led lamps that hummed. My arms and legs felt heavy, took effort hold myself, holding my head up was hard. My skin was wrinkled and thin, I was cold but had a blanket. A woman was walking towards me, past a counter, _NAME_, one of my voices. Same as my “delusional” memories. And boom, back in a flash. The voices proceeded to tell me that I was sick, needed to wake up. I came to thinking it was me, farther down in my life, that This world I’m experiencing now is just a fragmented memory to where I really am, sick, alone, lost in psychosis. That took me a few days to get over. It was all just the Illness. A strange flash and vision formed from a misfiring mind."

174331198,"My anxiety around people is broken down thus: I can’t filter out distractions properly. The more people, the more distractions and the more trouble I have functioning because I simply can’t concentrate. I totally blow with social cues. I can handle them if I’m with one other person or two other people, but can’t watch for them if I have more than two people because of point one. I suck at F2F interactions. Having to think my way through them is draining. The more people at once, the more draining the experience is (trying to make the right amount of eye contact with ten different people? Screw off!) There’s also the SZ. Other people – strangers especially – affect my positive symptoms. The larger the number of people the more stress it places on me. Being around enough people for long enough will cause my positive symptoms to resurface even if I am currently without. My therapists say I don’t have straight social anxiety, but that my anxiety over social situations is understandable 
and part of my symptom management."

Family history of schizophrenia has been considered in genetic studies under several models. De novo genetic events seem to play a larger role in sporadic cases.This study used the familial-sporadic distinction with the aim of identifying a more homogeneous phenotype to delineate the genetic and clinical complexity of schizophrenia.The study was conducted at Weskoppies Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa.The study included 384 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from the Afrikaner founder population in South Africa who are considered comparable to Caucasian patients from the United States. A comprehensive data capturing sheet was completed.
When schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder diagnoses were considered jointly, we found no significant differences between the sporadic and the familial groups for age at disease onset, season of birth, comorbid diagnoses, clinical symptomatology, history of suicide or marital status. When the diagnoses were examined separately, however, the sporadic schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, was found to have a significantly lower age at onset (mean 20.6 vs. 25.3 years).The sporadic schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, forms a more homogeneous subgroup for genetic studies."

I’m there to work. And I do a good job. But it’s stressful a bit and I can’t work 30 hours in order to get health insurance another way. Some companies give health insurance if you work 30 hours. I can only work 25 though I feel. So I need my disability lol. Thanks!!

They’re like advanced transhumanism experiments on people. Imagine super strength, intelligence, and psychic abilities. Ive never been strong though. Im always fat and weak. Aliens could be involved though. Ive seen them… I could go on, but I’ll embarass and annoy people. Of course, people will say i hallucinate those calls, but i just can’t accept and figure out who targeted me. Nothing really special about being a disabled schizophrenic super soldier. I get no help or benefits. I mever figured out why or the truth at all. Was it a person exclusively? I might have been in project _PERSON_, but don’t know. I’ve been researching my ass off constantly. It happened in 2011 at college. No proof or evidence at all. Apparently its all in my head. I’m scared to talk a lot. But need help obviously. I have my

175910330,Not much. I keep it inside. Although when I was first in the hospital this last time I yelled at the people behind the desk saying that I had to be transferred because I was heterosexual. I’m not homophobic or anything but it stemmed from the last time I was there. Everybody was telling me they were there because they were gay in my mind and this one guy said he was the only straight person on the ward. There was another unit you could see from ours and that was where I was supposed to be apparently. That was the only innopropriate actions I’ve displayed. Though when I was hanging out with one of my old high school friends years ago I blacked out on DABs (a THC concentrate) and talked to them about something like universal love and made a fool of myself. I also wnt out drinking by myself and ordered too many kinds of different drinks making a fool of myself which was unusual for me in my drinking days i rarely made a fool of myself.

I finally brought it up in therapy and my therapist said I need to find a mentor or a really good coworker who I can lean on for support, someone else who works in psych who will really get it. But it is hard for me to become close to people or let them know I am struggling. It really tempts me to just find a new job but I don’t have enough experience to easily find a new job yet.

175910372,"I found a lot of my “religious delusions” were based upon the unanswered questions revolving around my “non-ordinary perceptions and experiences”. I started perceiving and experiencing things that others “supposedly” do not and I sort of got trapped in this cycle of hiding and utilizing my knowledge of religion to identify attributes and then to attribute. That’s the mistake that most people make, at least initially, if not for most of their lives. Just like asking the question: “What is Psychosis?” and really getting in there and figuring that all out, one has to ask questions like: “What IS a prophet?”, what does that word really translate to mean and what context was it used in when it was originated, and why? I found I had to develop skepticism but not closed skepticism. Instead of some sort of dichotomous or digital thinking about what I was experiencing and perceiving, I had to look as one would a spectrum and not rush into judgments. Some voices will toy with a hearer a 
lot and further complicate the situation. Additionally, it does not help when people around you are not willing to explore with you, in a non-judgemental or pathologizing manner."

174331258,"When I got out of high school at 17 I worked at many jobs, never lasting more than three months at any of them. I had a couple friends from my first couple jobs and we smoked pot and drove around in our cars. Sadly, we drank often, even while driving. We got around in our own little areas. I had dropped my childhood friends, it was solely my fault, kinda ditched them in favor of my new friends. IDK. A month after I turned 18 my sisters roommate moved out of the apartment they rented to get married and my sister needed a roommate and she asked me if I wanted to move in. I thought it would be cool to be out on my own so I moved in. I stayed about a year until I had several bad acid trips, and the last one triggered my schizophrenia when I was 19. Living there actually was cool sometimes. I paid my share of the rent and half the utilities and phone bills and I had the run of the apartment. I had my friends over, I worked my various little jobs. But later on, years later I realized I was in my prodomal 
stage pretty much the whole time I lived there. I had really bad agoraphobia too and it was almost painful to know the other tenants saw me anytime I went out, I didn’t want anyone looking at me. I panicked when I had to go in stores and stuff and for awhile driving was just as bad. I can remember some good things about living there. The time some stoner I kind of knew fronted me a shopping bag full of homegrown pot. We arranged it that as soon as I sold enough I would pay him back $100. I remember taking the bag home and dumping it out on the kitchen table and just being so happy to have that much pot for myself. The guy said it was a pound but actually it was about two pounds. I sold half to pay him back and smoked the rest with my friends. A lot of other stuff went on but I was basically just working and partying, no real dreams, plans, or goals. I was kind of on the fringe of society along with my two friends, I had one foot in mainstream society because I worked, but after work got off and on weekends 
it was smoking pot and stealing and fraternizing with unemployed stoners. Due to the acid, I had to move out and move back in with parents. My friends went their separate ways and I started isolating and then somehow I began seeing a therapist. I liked her a lot, lol. She was young, cute, friendly and nice. I loved going to see her and I thought she was sexy too. Saw her for about six months until I went into a psyche ward. From the psyche ward I moved into a group home and they figured I was schizophrenic. It seemed one day I was fine and then something snapped and I turned psychotic and stayed that way for the next two years. This was all long ago in the 1970’s and '80’s."

175910418,I used to think the rest of my life would be spent in the same room with my parents taking care of me and once they passed I would be done for. But then I told myself “what if I tried harder” ? Can it get any worse than it already is? No it can’t. And guess what. Three years later I’m able to hold down a job and socialize. I live on my own. I am not able to raise kids and even a serious romantic relationship might be too much right now but I am still entertaining the thought that tomorrow I can change my mind.

174331267,"The following research suggests that DID affects 1 percent of the population: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24788904/ Until two days ago, the incidence, as cited by Wikipedia, was at two percent. Now somebody has changed it to 1.5 percent at Wikipedia. I think this is the toughest Disorder since it almost exclusively begins in childhood. Other disorders are co-morbid (probably) because of that reason. Even when there is childhood Schizophrenia, there is a lot of comorbidity: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16916600/ What I am trying to get at is that childhood Schizophrenia maybe under-diagnosed. It would be insidious if there were just delusions, thus being diagnosed later in life. My therapist, whom I have been seeing since 3 years, thinks my illness is post-natal. I have solid evidence (in pictures) that this is the case. But, I went undiagnosed till the age of 25, when I had auditory hallucinations. Thus, what I am suggesting is, that the glitch may exist from before. The Disorder 
is possibly diagnosed later. Intervention, and research, early in the childhood, could make the occurrence of comorbidity more tractable. Therefore, my connection carries an insurmountable weight. This is because there would be early, instant diagnosis, right there, where the glitch appears. The glitch may appear earlier in life, and symptoms may be apparent later in life. That would be the second inference based on that connection. The third, and the most important inference that may be made, is Bad Biological Learning and Causality between diseases. This I will explain later."

From what she said to me, his son keeps himself all the time in his bedroom and doesn’t talk to her. It’s very abusive from her. By the way, there are people diagnosed with schizophrenia who they themselves say they are dangerou (even if they haven’t commited a crime). So they don’t help at all with their own problem."

174331294,"Okay, first of all, don’t be silly as me, don’t try ketamine without telling your doctor, it could be really dangerous for you, especially if your medication doesn’t work well and is unable to stablize your symptoms like paranoia, delusions or hallucinations, since ketamine is well known to cause those symptoms as secondaries effects . Also, sorry if I posted this topic in the wrong place, and don’t worry I’m not here to promote drugs, I’m just talking about my experience with ketamine. So, let’s start. I’ve been diagnosed as schizoaffective back in 2017. I started with valporate, didn’t work and quickly abandoned it. I was under Abilify Maintena, and had terrible mood swings, tiredness and was feeling like ???? under this medication. So, one year later, I tried to come off Abilify, terrible mistake, brought me back to hospital, and here, they’ve decided to include Lithium to my treatment. I don’t know if it was a good thing or not, but I have less severe mood swings but the c
ombination of those two meds made my tiredness worse and I’m experiencing slurred speech, which is REALLY annoying. Anyway, Lithium has been successful for dealing with my hypomania, but didn’t work that much for my depressive periods who can last 2/3 weeks, which is also really painful and annoying. A friend of mine asked me if I wanted to try ketamine since he told me it was effective against depressive symptoms, I said no at first. Then my depression worsened. So I said yes, but only a little dosage, to start of. Since I’m still under Abilify and pretty comfortable with it, nothing like psychosis , paranoia or hallucinations happened to me, probably due to low dosage. Also, something really important before I go further, do NOT TAKE TOO MUCH KETAMINE WHILE BEING ON LITHIUM, IT CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR KIDNEYS 20/30mins after sniffing ketamine, I was feeling at ease and pretty calm, no euphoria, I was only doing bad puns, and my depression was behind me during this time. The worse part was sleeping, 
I almost didn’t sleep after taking it and I had to woke up early so I recommand to use it during the day and not evening. 5 days after taking it, my speech is still slurred, I’m still feeling really tired sometimes,but dang it, my mood really improved and it seems like it has totally erased my mood swings right now, I’m not feeling hypomaniac nor depressive, just, normal I’m feeling a little bit more confident, but nothing too important, but I feel I can do more things and improve myself in everyday life. So, do you think that someday ketamine while be used to treat some symptoms of schizoaffectivity ?"

174331311,"Below is my first attempt at blogging… I think I got better at writing as I went… but this one is cool because I was still employed - yet knew my days there were numbered. It’s time to kick off a blog of my very own. Afterall why not I had asked myself… and besides everyone’s doing it i subsequently told myself. Now the chance is high this will be something to be begun and never finished… but then again, how does one “finish” a blog anyway? Many facets of our lives have succint beginnings and even middles, but endings? Probably it is the lack thereof that adds sadness to people, and they can’t even articulate any part of it. For example do you think your career will have a nice beginning, middle, and end? Will your marriage? Your lifetime? It’s actually doubtful… but understanding that said concept is craved by yourself, and those around you, as product of history (stories essentially), literature, pop culture, etc. can help you make sense of your world, and help others do the 
same."

You don’t really need strong, just have to be the right medicine. On top of that, it depends on the dose and mode of administration.

But I worry endlessly about this. And I end up thinking I have an alcohol use disorder, which my psychiatrist and therapist vehemently deny. If it's not clear, I take psychiatric medicine and also drink alcohol. Does anyone have any advice on how to just let this issue go?

175910726,"Maybe this is naïve but my health plan really seems to care. I have a local health coverage that consolidates all the benefits of Medicaid and Medicare into one single coverage. My parents had _PERSON_ hospital as I grew up and I was covered too of course. When I was nearing 21 years old, _PERSON_ told us that I could keep _PERSON_ for my own as an adult if I filled out some paperwork. I just didn’t take it seriously or I waited too long to file the paperwork.and I let the opportunity slip away until it was too late and I lost that coverage. But _PERSON_ hospital always struck me as kind of cold somehow anyways, more of a business than most hospitals. I was rarely sick as a child so I hardly went there except maybe for a routine physical examination once a year or an occasional tetanus shot when I stepped on nails. My mom always had health problems and was there a lot though. I actually saw my first therapist at age 19 through _PERSON_ and I did have a few health issues in the next couple years 
but then I got Medicare and Medicaid when I got ill and they came along with SSDI and SSI. But now with my current plan they are really proactive in helping me. I have my own case manager who had me fill out a “Health Care Assessment” form asking me about my mental and physical health and then my caseworker helps me with my most pressing medical problems. Medicare never struck me as going out of there way to help me but my current plan offers me so much personal help. They send me info about losing weight for an example. I mentioned to my case worker that I am overweight and the next thing I know they send me free vouchers to attend Weight Watchers meetings. They gave me info and the number for a 24 hour, 7 days a week service where I can call a nurse hotline for any questions or information pertaining to my health. I’m currently using the ten free visits to a physical therapist for my back and it really loosens me up and helps. They gave me free visits to a chiropractor. They offerded me a free program 
on diabetes prevention. I get to see a nutritionist. And I didn’t ask for most of these services, they contacted me. I just always figured Social Security and Medicare were business’s who really didn’t care about the individual, we were all just anonymous bodies with a social security number who got helped on a big assembly line with the minimum of care. But my current plan goes out of their way to help and they seem to worry more about my health than I do and they seem so personal! Their latest help is a program where I can go to the nearest gym or fitness and get a free membership."

175910728,"TMo, having a home can be costly at times. If your roof has damage due to storms or wind, you can file a claim on your homeowners insurance to help with the roof cost. If you make the repairs you have mentioned, why sell it. You will have everything taken care of, your home is an investment. Renting is expensive & you are giving someone else your hard earned money. My daughter & her husband rented for 5 years from a man. He jacked up the rent every year when it was time to renew their lease. They just bought a home & moved into it a couple of weeks ago. Buying the house was cheaper than their rent. If you sell, then rent & then decide to buy again, keep in mind real estate goes up it rarely comes down. Depending on what you can afford, you could end up with a home that needs repairs. Then you may find keeping your home would have been a better idea. Take on your repairs one at a time.

I really feel like a huge burden and yet at the same time I’m the person that runs the house and keeps it going. I take care of my husband and child (feeding, laundry, all the housework), I work (it I guess did work) 40+ work weeks to get the money to pay the bills, I help my grandparents (we are taking over there mortgage so they can keep their house), and I’ve taken care of my mother since she fell ill about 5 years ago. I think it’s just one thing after another. Usually I can use CBT and talk myself down. I’ve helped myself keep it together for over a decade. Now I feel like I just can’t anymore. I don’t even have a doctor I see. My PCP ignored my post partum depression; which was likely part of all 
of this—it got so bad I didn’t believe my child was mine when he was an infant and then I didn’t leave the house for months; afraid someone would take him. Now I can’t stand to be in the house. I feel like I need to do, to go, if I stop I’m going to lose. Anything for a little bit of quiet."

Then when you agreed with them I thought, “Yeah, maybe they’re right.” But my final thought is that I don’t know how you function but maybe if it makes you feel better you can still stay with your mom but make a few changes if that would make you feel better about living there. Even if they are small changes like doing the dishes more or doing a little cooking or doing something to make your mom happy. Maybe going out to the garden and picking a rose every morning and putting it on the table for your mom. Be creative. Your mom is your closest family so I would go by what she says, NOT by what other relatives say who do not have the whole picture. I bet your mom is happy when she sees you’re happy so stay there if it makes both of you happy. Don’t make any rash decisions, think this situation through."

174331338,You have to have a certain number of symptoms before getting a sz diagnosis. Paranoia alone and nothing else would not qualify you for a sz diagnosis. There is a disorder called schizotypal personality disorder that basically just means you are a very paranoid person but don’t really have other symptoms of psychosis.

For the God's sake my sister has no clue about how hacking works and what is it in the first place. My cousin begins just a childish herself as always. I remember i warned my sister to not trust anyone especially my relatives but she was texting her without our knowledge. Anyway when she told me about that i told her we should tell my mum but she refused and we then tried to fix things without letting my mom and my aunt know until one day when we went to visit one of my aunt for a celebration. That was a disaster. They fought and my mom was angry and disappointed at us for hiding the issue and i can't blam her. It was all fault I'm the oldest and i should've reacted with responsible. Now my mom's mad me and both of my sisters. She doesn't want to talk to us and she said that we broke her heart and humiliated her in front of m
y relatives. I don't know if she will ever forgive us. I'm pretty sure she will never forget because what we did was horrible. I don't deserve her anymore after what I've done. I wish if i could back in time and tell her everything before that night. I wish if i acted with more responsibly.

175910838,"So ive been psychotic for around 7 months in the last 3 year and have been locked up in a mental hospital until about 6 months ago. So i’ve started this theory. Im 21. Preface: I know its probably bs but i was wondering if there were similar experiences. The secret service can hear your toughts and communicate with you trough nanobots. I think the nanobots can activate your brain to send out electronic shocks, which are toughts or make you do actions. I think they are connected to an artificial intelligence that is a result of the ai _NAME_ turing made in ww2. This ai is shared by all secret services. First they communicated only by my toughts. But now i only hear the “secret service” in lyricless music, because they know it upsets me when they talk to me using my own brain. If i dont listen to lyricless music there are no symptoms anymore. I think in 3 different languages and i think im ??????? stupid because i believe this. They say i have an iq of 242 and a creative intelligence of over 40
0 and am going to work for the secret service. I dont believe this whatsoever. Because 1: they have never used a word i havent heard before so it must be my imagination. Sometimes i do hear “classified” though when i dont know a word in a specific language. And 2, if the secret service would want you, why would they not just send an email. And 3: im way too dumb to ever figure this insane reality out, im probably just stroking my own ego. I also believe they can make you do actions, which make you seem psychotic/schizofrenic. When i say “snap your fingers if you are going to work for the secret service” i snap my fingers without a thought, or intent. W.T.F. The only way i feel like i could have a free will and inner peace is when i smoke weed. I havent told anyone, because im afraid the doctors will lock me up again. When i smoke weed i can not be forced to listen to them or preform certain actions. Smoking weed is the only way i can stop this obsession. They say its a way of telling them i want a tim
e out. My psychiatrist told me when i smoke weed it only gets worse, but it’s the only thing that completely stops all symptoms of my schizofrenia for the rest of the day. Am i dumb, seaking attention, should i stop smoking weed even though its the only thing that helps and am i insane?"

175910844,I think these diagnosis aren’t really contributing to person’s state of mind. Two different doctors can give you two different diagnosis for the same problem. Taking blood and urine samples is only for checking whether or not you are using any psychadelics/drugs. Otherwise there is no test to prove that you are suffering from sz other than observing your behaviour. Personally for me I was first diagnosed with sz by a doctor and after three years another doctor diagnosed me with bi polar. There is no way pdocs can tell who is sz and who isn’t through blood urine tests. Depression and sz are two different things and only sz comes under the bracket of psychosis. But all patients with psychosis need not be suffering from sz there are psychosis cases due to other reasons as well. Sz/bipolar all are same.
175910845,Thanks for all the replies.
174331340,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Implications of early life stress on fetal metabolic programming of schizophrenia: A focus on epiphenomena underlying morbidity and early mortality. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry, Mar 2020 03 The fetal origin of adult disease hypothesis postulates that a stressful in utero environment can have deleterious consequences on fetal programming, potentially leading to chronic disease in later life. Factors known to impact fetal programming include the timing, intensity, duration and nature of the external stressor during pregnancy. As such, dynamic modulation of fetal programming is heavily involved in shaping health throughout the life course, possibly by influencing metabolic parameters including insulin action, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity and immune function. The ability of prenatal insults to program adult disease is likely to occur as a result of reduced functional capacity in key organs-a ""thrifty"" phenotype-where 
more resources are re-allocated to preserve critical organs such as the brain. Notably, it has been postulated that the manifestation of neuropsychiatric disorders in individuals priorly exposed to prenatal stress may arise from the interaction between hereditary factors and the intrauterine environment, which together precipitate disease onset by disrupting the trajectory of normal brain development. In this review we discuss the evidence linking prenatal programming to neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly schizophrenia, via a ""Thrifty psychiatric phenotype"" concept. We start by outlining the conception of the thrifty psychiatric phenotype. Next, we discuss the convergence of potential mechanistic pathways through which prenatal insults may trigger epigenetic changes that contribute to the increased morbidity and early mortality observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, we touch on the public health importance of fetal programming for these disorders. We conclude by providing a brief outlook on the fu
ture of this evolving field of research."

But I know it can take months to feel the full effect of a dose change so I will try to stick it out. I still would like to recover substantially but I realized I was putting too much pressure on myself, so I am just trying to accept day to day whatever recovery comes my way and learn to live with that. Glad to meet you all on the forum!"

175910873,"There is one thing that I like about doing all college classes for my entire senior year of high school. I get to skip the events that everyone else considers important and ""fun."" Prom sounds like a disaster that I would not like to attend. Ever . A graduation ceremony and photos seems entirely pointless and boring. Who cares? My mom had asked me once or twice what I wanted to do for my own graduation party and who I would like to invite. I responded saying that I didn't want a graduation party. I don't care that I'm done with high school forever. It doesn't even really matter to me. I don't have friends there to invite, and a party just feels like a waste of my time for something that I don't even care about. I'm already going to be done with an entire year of college while everyone else is sitting there at a useless high school graduation ceremony - so why bother with something stupid like a party for graduating? It's not that big of a deal. I'm the same with birthdays as well... mine is coming 
up soon enough and I know that someone in my family will try and 'get me to have some fun for once!' I don't want to go out and have fun. It's like any other day. It's not special. After analyzing my supposedly ""not normal"" responses... those might be some schizoid moments."

175910894,"Yeah i think they dont know much about the brain. To me the dsm was more limiting for good treatment than helpful. It seemed like they jumped to conclusions, picked a random label (sz, autism, borderline, bipolar) and then interpreted all my behaviour through that lens. E.g. when i “had borderline” for a few months, they suddenly saw manipulation, splitting and attentionseeking in all my behaviour, while i thought “the intention behind this is totally different”. When i “had autism”, they tought i didnt understand anything and started to talk as if i were a deaf imbecile. Because i “had sz” most of the time, they refused to treat my problems, like trauma, with therapy. Since i on the other hand didnt (and dont) want their pills, we were kind of stuck. I wonder if diagnoses that describe simple symptoms “anxiety”, “psychosis”, “anger”, “mania” and a simple clues to their origin “trauma”, “drug abuse” “organic damage” wouldnt do more justice to many people.

175910902,"sounds like you’re doing really well & high functioning Air. I actually find work much easier than study. The work load & deadlines were much more manageable & there wasn’t endless, huge amounts of reading to do anymore. Plus you get paid! I’m in my mid 40’s and nothing in my life has been so difficult & stressful as full time study. So you may be pleasantly surprised when you start working. The only hard thing about work was the requirements to interact socially & to maintain relationships with colleagues & managers. When I was studying I could be very withdrawn & introverted & nobody noticed or cared. In contrast, I found the workplace to be quite socially demanding. But if you’re good with people you should be fine."

175910913,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers. These are the things on my calm down techniques list that I first started using to help with OCD. Biofeedback/neurofeedback also helped me a lot. It’s expensive, but so worth it. I did it for 12 years and now I don’t even have OCD listed on my diagnoses anymore."

It dictates so much, it even dictates our reading comprehension. My memory right now isn't well with Seroquel because of the receptors it works on and also because im upping my Trileptal.

I’m not trying to be mean, maybe it’s not deliberate, but you need to be made aware of how it looks to others. That’s not to say you can’t make new topics on your own, but you have to be concrete in what it is you want. Like this topic you just ask for advice without giving any information about what it is you want advice for. And the dialog in the post become unconstructive, like a guessing game. That can be frustrating to other members. You can learn a lot from reading what other people post you know. Amongst other thing you might find other people who have similar symptoms to your own, what diagnosis they have and how they deal with it. And also you can find people who use the same meds you are and what experiences they have had with side effects etcetra. To learn more about yourself you need to step outside of yourself"

I figure, if I am helping my fellow humans, I am living a life in accordance with the bible. I don’t need to prove my faith to anyone, including myself. Anyone who thinks they need to do religious things to be a good follower of that religion is seriously misunderstanding the point of religion. It is to provide a moral framework in which you can help others. All religions basically boil down to “be nice and treat everyone with respect” and all the problems people have with religion come from overthinking beyond that basic rule."

175911023,So I’ve asked my partner to leave for the night or a few days I’m not sure how long. A couple of weeks ago I came downstairs and he had the dog pinned down on her side. I was really mad and asked what he was doing and he said he was trying to show her he was the dominant one … I don’t like this at all and it’s made me very paranoid. However I don’t know if I’m paranoid for due reason. I am worried he might kill me and the dog. He calls her pea brain and pushes her away. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want this relationship to end. But I can’t cope with going to bed next to someone I’m afraid will kill me. I’d rather be safe than sorry. In the meantime I came to my mums house and a note had been placed theough the door by him about me.

I take my main anti psychotic in the morning so thats why I thought perhaps that would be the reason. I take abilify in the morning with my benztropine and zoloft.
175911026,"All I can tell you is, my psychiatrist uses me as an example for many of his patients. He tells me this. Clearly, he believes many of his patients can also do great things. I also want to tell you that not all psychiatrists are equally knowledgeable. My psychiatrist has also studied psychotherapy, which isn’t really used by majority of psychiatrists. My old psychiatrist was incompetent and nearly landed me in jail because of his poor treatment plan. After I got to my current psychiatrist, everything turned around. You just have to believe in yourself."

I take IBS meds to help manage colon spasms and also headache meds to counter the migraines and stress headaches I get. I still stress but at least I know I am not going to die from cancer. On a funny note, I used to believe I had cancer also. I was sure of it which made my IBS worse. After many tests believe it or not, I did have cancer. lol.

175911101,I started taking ativan 3 years ago because I was having severe anxiety. The ativan seemed to quit working. I was nervous wreck so I told my doctor and switched me to valium. I’ve been on valium a month but I’m having adverse reactions to it. I’m having really weird dreams. It makes me impulsive and angry. I’m taking to many risks when driving and getting aggressive on the road. I live with my grandmother and cousin and they say I’ve been yelling in my sleep. My grandmother woke me up at 3 am today and asked if I was ok because I was screaming in my sleep. I’ve been taking Valium for a month. It does weird stuff to me in my sleep nightmares and stuff. It also makes me impulsive and aggressive on the road. I’ve tried klonopin and it didn’t work out for me. I’m wondering if xanax would be the next thing to try. Ativan works but it doesn’t last long enough. It wares off in a couple hours and I’m a nervous wreck again. I take it 3 times a day. I’m at the end of my rope with anxie
ty stuff. I’ve had nervousness problems my whole life. Ativan only lasts 2 hours but I get relief from my nervousness. My anxiety has been so bad over the past 6 months I was losing weight and smoking 4 packs of cigarettes a day. Are there any solutions out there?

I just want to lose weight without anyone judging what I’m doing or how I’m doing it. But changing my diet is an easy thing I can do. So I’ll start there.

175911138,Maybe try another med? I took several antipsychotic meds before finding the right combination and the pdoc added a mood stabiliser too.
174331406,Welcome to the forum! I’m sorry your voices are overwhelming. Make sure to take your meds and tell your psychiatrist (pdoc) how you’re really doing so he/she can get you on the best meds and dosages for you.

175911141,They’ll only restrain you if you act violently. They’ll only sedate or give you too many antipsychotics if you’re delusional. Just be reasonable. You probably do need the meds. If you’re being admitted it’s probably because you ARE delusional and can’t tell okay?

174331418,"Some people have spent entire lifetimes with their own theory of what is wrong only to be discredited. At least I can now think. I cannot in any way give a definitive answer, but I have a few observations. Hallucinations sound like a person talking. They use language and, personally, I do not think they are representative of my own will. Sometimes very nice people have the most evil voices. It’s a big mystery. If hallucinations are from some outer source, I have to postulate an antenna that receives from some source. Delusions are fixed false beliefs. They may be planted there. They are very rigid. They do not obey regular logic. The ability to explain “why” is damaged. There might be some test in the brain that tells us when something is true, and this litmus test for truth is out of kilter. You cannot have logic if you cannot have truth. The structure of thinking is upset. I myself could not think in long stretches like in a book. I had small ideas that didn’t necessarily go anywhere. Som
e of my thinking was just about one word. Are there any metaphors for the structure of the brain? Is schizophrenia lower, basic, a foundation, something primitive, something underneath? Are there normally walls that separate parts, and are those walls broken? Do these lesions open and close with relapses and recovery?"

It sounds like an excellent plan to get a jump start to weight loss. I have been doing a lot of thinking about it, as I am making ever-healthier changes to my food intake. I am going to shoot for a long-term goal weight of 160 instead of 175. That means I will have lost half my body weight. But I think I can do it! I am eating a lot of tofu/chickpeas/beans/greens/seeds/whole grains and I have really increased the quality of what I eat. I am not saying meat is bad, but I personally choose to eat it only once a week. That’s what I have unconsciously been doing for the last three months or so anyway, it’s just now that I reviewed my food logs that I realize it. I feel really good with my dietary changes so I am going to continue. I am basically vegetarian, with chicken once per week. I am 88 pounds down, have 71 to go. My goal is

175911255,Yeah you’re right. I guess I’m just peeved that shes taking it so personally. I mean I was worried when she went off meds but I wasnt /angry/ like she is right now. Shes pushing me away but I think shes just over whelmed. I called my pdoc and left her a message and told her why j quit them.

175911265,"I hope hydrogen gas isn’t harmful to breathe in. That’s my next fascination. I’m actually paring down my supplementation to just hydrogen sources ATM. First the hydrogen water, then hydrogen gas when my inhaler comes in. Even the water with hydrogen gas at 1000 parts per billion is a very effective anti-inflammatory (studies show it lowers TBARS even, so it’s not just placebo.) Inhaling hydrogen gas is going to be way more efficient at delivering it to the body. My brain’s just beginning to feel really good and “smooth”, not so pressured, painful and frustrated like before. All thanks to hydrogen water. Studies show it can help the all-important “tight junctions” repair themselves throughout the body, which theoretically would mean healing a permeable gut lining and blood-brain barrier. Inhaling hydrogen for health benefits is a fairly new science; the first study on it was performed in Japan in 2007. Big unexplored niche here."

175911273,I live in isolation. But it’s kind of solitude too. I think I will find it easier to live in solitude when I move out of the family house.

175911276,well that’s discouraging. Did the fact that it took two years for you to relapse make you want to try again to see if you could go awhile w/o APs? I know of a psychologist that relapsed once and then never did again and it’s been 20 years . . .

175911281,"i wanted to know how its like for you for comparing, and for hope hopefully, i dont like that its so slow, im in therapy for 1.2 years, im having a hard time really opening up, my therapist helps but when i dont like her i can't leap over that, it could either ruin the whole session and i end up not talking to her or either i would have to force myself to talk to her when i really really dont want to, and then wait for her to rebuilt my trust again. outside of therapy i think im becoming more vulnerable, or maybe im just expressing my needs more, more isolation, im just expiriencing the pain that has been there inside, before that i didn't feel anything. i think im confusing being vulnerable with simply letting my feelings take over me, i tend to limit how much control my feelings have because it can be dangerous for me, i almost ran over someone for not responding to my car's horn. i guess i tried being vulnerable last session tho, i froze for 15~ mins, couldn't move, like how do i go forward from 
there? i can't move, not to mention i can't speak to my therapist, i can only put on my shield again and only then i can speak, i know myself and i told my therapist that if i take my shield off i don't speak to her, she only has to move he legs a bit too agressively to make me freeze, last session i barely said anything. what are your expiriences, anyone knows what im going through first hand? anybody already been there? i should mention my father used to be very impatient with his needs, i had to follow his orders without delay, he was very unexpected in his rage he would go from 0 to 120 in a second, so im always on alert even though it was many years ago, every move can be very scary, my therapist tries not to move alot, but it's still unsustainable"

175911392,"I had both good and bad ones. Some would try to bring me down, while other would comfort me or cheer me on."
175911393,Cool ! I am actually worthless when it comes to manual labor
175911394,So just a word of warning.. when you're in your deepest dreams.. there's nothing you can hide from.. I've got my eye on you
174331460,Just curious how it’s helped
175911395,I hope your appointment goes well! That's nice of her to text you that
175911396,"I’m doing the same thing currently with my therapist. She is making me do things out of my comfort zone. She told me to take a walk every time I wake up. I do it even if I don’t feel like it, and it has worked out so far."
175911397,"Yeah, I understand. You know better than me, if it’s worth it."
175911398,On the bus heading home from Walmart. Got some cool Halloween shirts and fleece pajama bottoms. Will post pics later
175911399,"The last time I was extremely suicidal the ER doctor gave me IV ketamine. I immediately started to hallucinate and hallucinated the entire time he had the IV going. The hallucinations were very vivid and exaggerated. Once he stopped it the hallucinations stopped and then I felt really good. It didn’t stop them from hospitalizing me even though I changed my mind about needing to go. I don’t know if ketamine is helpful for depression if you get multiple treatments, but it definitely gets your attention."
175911400,Possible trigger: I keep having intense suicidal urges. I'm not going to do anything it's just really frustrating and upsetting.
175911401,My psychosis was based a lot around hell heaven messiahs prophets God. But also sex and relationships and self confidence. Idk. Perhaps if religion didn’t exist I’d still have come up with scary things.
175911402,And what happend?
175911403,"For me my mine races on various thoughts and won’t stop that subject till I do it or obtain it, you think full speed and it drains you, all the would if’s and such till you go mad. Sleep can turn it off, but as soon as you wake up away it goes again."
175911404,"My shoulder is back to hurting. Of course. I was just at the GP's yesterday and it hadn't been hurting so I didn't even think to ask about it. Now it is hurting again and I'm like, why didn't I bring this up yesterday?! Sometimes I am so stupid. I don't think of things when I need to think of them!"
175911405,That’s strange. I know we each have different chemical makeups and sleep and diet can also play a role. I didn’t think they helped for a while but this is actually the first time I’ve had really good results and the science research results speak the same. I don’t touch caffeine myself or any other drug. I hope you find something that works for you.
175911406,yeah I see that too
175911407,_PERSON_
175911408,"Diet was a huge factor for me. I can’t do any kind of drug and I don’t do caffeine, and I just have more energy in general. Also, drinking a lot of water helps, as does healthy sleep schedules."
175911409,Great news!!!
175911410,"Just like _AT_MENTION_ said, I think a medical alert bracelet is much better."
175911411,"grandiose delusions, paranoia. you can be sz/sza by being very delusional even if you don’t hallucinate. Why did they diagnose with schizotypal?"
175911412,"So im testing a new thing. Earplugs, those from pharmacy. Ive had them on now for 15 minutes. Its quiet but not totally. Feel a calming effect. Will Update If I sleep better. If its a hit or miss."

175911417,"I learned to “pull my mind in” from thought broadcasting because I decided it was a waste of energy. Also, it was like faking being sociable. Friendships can be actual once in awhile. We have to be careful when we do find a friend When we have paranoia, we will shoo them away even unintentionally."

174331457,"Ive lost intetest in gaming, i have budget gaming pc and numerous games that old myself would be so happy to play, but i rarely play anythinf on it. I barely have enougb motivation to shower and eat, its horrible. Sometimes i just force myself to play and it feels like a chore."
175911419,You’re being too hard on yourself. Allow yourself to “fail” a few times before you get back there again.
175911420,Nice. I wish you all the best.
174331459,I do daily exercise. I think it helps so much.
175911421,"I notice that I haven't been listening to podcasts for about a week. I feel like everything is the same. It's all the same stuff.. Like I know everything already.. There's bits of pieces of interesting things that I can focus on but what's the point I find? Everything is exhausting to me. It's all too much. I just told my mom about the alprazolam and that I need to tell my doctor to taper off of something. She got mad and says she's tired. Wants to control my money again but she already has most of my money in her account. Now she's banging pots and pans. I just want positive vibes. Not the drama. My mom is so dramatic. I haven't bought drugs in a year. I bought the alprazolam over a year ago. All the stress is surrounding me. My mom has to work. I worry about my parents dying. There's so much **** in my head about what to do and I keep arguing with the people on the video chat in my mind because they misunderstood my personality, identity, ideas, everything.. Saying I would end up as a serial kill
er, gaslighting me.. No ones ever done that and Idk why it effects me so much. There's so many things I can do but I'm nihilistic and care too much about what other people think. Everything does one little thing and is able to keep hold of their identity and talk about things while focusing on one thing to talk about.. I want to do something great for the world, make money but also I don't care about money either. It's like a game that I have to play that I don't want to play. I just want to get out of here and have a change in life and stop sitting on my bed where I sleep. It's like I'm completely alone, it's cold and cloudy and I feel miserable. I say things that I regret online and don't have any friends. People think it's cool to be an introvert and antisocial. I was like that but was down on myself. I'm horribly hard on myself and want to do better but I'm torturing myself based on what the people on the video chat said, what people in real life say - Whether I'm smart enough to do what I want to do or g
ood enough in general and I think about the past and what I could have done. Then there's all this advise saying ""this"" and ""that"" and I have to absorb it all and keep messing up and can't absorb it all and everyone is crazy. I want to help people but I'm really messed up. It's like I'm not a real person with any worth yet I know that's not true. I don't want to watch movies right now or do anything. I don't know how people can ignore everything and just be mindful.. Then I think of practicing mindfulness and meditating but that's one of the many many things that I can do. I can do so many things but it's like I'm thinking of everything at once. I think the way to cure this is to just pretend that I'm fine and stop freaking out, wait until everything blows over and ease myself back into society, the internet, my family, my life... It's like I need to be depressed because I'm exhausted but I'm too much of an achiever and can't let go."

175911424,"You said you were diagnosed as Bipolar 2 (net says no full mania). Typing in on the search engine what you said were your symptoms (depression, irritability, impulsiveness, anxiety), one website that came up was mentalhealthmn.org, which discussed bipolar, and below that category had another website you could go to find out more. The other website, verywellmind.com, said there was a division of bipolar called “not otherwise specific” (NOS). It said, “Bipolar disorder NOS is usually diagnosed when a patient shows some symptoms of bipolar disorder but doesn't necessarily meet all the criteria….” It said, “In general, NOS is most commonly ascribed when a mood disorder is characterized by depression alternating with short episodes of hypomania (a milder form of mania). Oftentimes, the mood swings are rapid, occurring within days of each other. By and large, children and adolescents are most frequently diagnosed with NOS as they will be least likely to have a previous history of mood dysfunc
tion.” It added: “From a psychiatric standpoint, bipolar disorder NOS is taken just as seriously as any other form of mood disorder. It presumes that there is a problem and that it will be likely more definitively diagnosed in the future. By assigning the NOS diagnosis now, the person will be less likely to slip through the cracks should another mood episode occur."" However, you said ""my mood tends to fluctuate daily. .... I don't seem to have classic bi polar symptoms but am diagnosed with Bi polar 2."" In my case, without medicine, my moods can change with daily events, good or bad. With medicine, I generally stay in the middle. I haven't been depressed after I was put on Lithium (and Mirtazapine anti-depressant), and that's been over 25 years. I immediately noticed a vast change when put on Lithium, as if the air had been let out of an overtight balloon. You said you noticed no change on bipolar medicine. You feel like you have enough problems to go to a psychiatrist, but you aren't mentally ill and 
don't respond to medicine. If this is not bipolar, what could it be? What is your chief emotional complaint? More On Chronic Illness Growing Through Adversity Living With Chronic Pain"
175911425,"I can relate. On days I take my sleep aid, I sleep maybe 9-12 hours. On days I don’t, I’m lucky to get 3. So I generally stick with the sleep aids. Insomnia triggers depression, psychosis, mania, anxiety, and pretty much every single mental illness under the sun. I’d rather get lots of sleep than none."
175911426,are u still on other medications for replacemnt of invega or still on it?

175911428,"My husband is off work today (he works three Saturdays of each month), so we are going to our favorite restaurant for lunch. I get my beloved southwest tofu wrap with fruit salad. Then we are going grocery shopping for the week. I guess that’s not too exciting. Been looking forward to the wrap all week though. I don’t eat an entire block of tofu fast enough to buy one at the grocery store, so I like going out for it. I love tofu! I hope you have a great day!"

175911444,I was on 256mg And got shot reductions over the course of two years … Down to 78mg Been 8 months off my 78mg ???? of Invega sustenna… I’m hoping i don’t need to take it every again… I got terrible Parkinsonism…
175911445,Oh well _USER_ID_ this thread then
175911446,"At the time, it didn’t seem so bad. But I’ve realized how bad it was now. Me and my friends were fishing at the local ponds. We were headed home and we saw this little kid fishing by himself. He was probably 10 years old and we were about 13. We went down to talk to him and he had a bunch of really nice “lures”. Really fancy ones. One of us took one and then all three of us started taking some. The kid started crying and we left with most of his “lures” and some other fishing stuff. Wow, now it sounds so mean but that wasn’t typical of us. We didn’t do that all the time."
175911447,I don’t know. I can see counselors who care reading this forum for a little while to try to understand. But I doubt for more than one day.
174331471,"I have only played around with medication changes very very briefly. I was initially put on Invega pills and only switched to fluphenazine ( I think ) for a day and I got terrible involuntary twitches that were painful. I didn’t really want to try switching again after that due to how bad an experience that was but I was given an injection of Zyprexa when I was psychotic and I didn’t mind the feeling of that from what I remember. That was just one injection though and I haven’t tried it orally. I am currently on Invega and Abilify and I only wanted put on the Abilify because I wanted to be double sure I wouldn’t get psychotic again. It’s probably overkill but with Abilify added I don’t have to worry about prolactin at least theoretically. I have been having issues with suicidal thoughts but I know I won’t act on them and am able to move beyond such thoughts. I can’t narrow down what medication I am on that causes the thoughts or even if it is medication related, I suspect it’s due 
to the absence of dopamine from Invega and Abilify though. I have been waiting for lumateperone to be approved so I can try an antipsychotic that doesn’t interfere with dopamine but after talking to my sister about how I felt I thought maybe she was right that I could be on a different med and respond better. So what has your experience been in switching meds? Elaborate as much as you need I want to see many views on this."
175911448,I’m hearing alittle voices throughout the day before I used to only hear voices in the evening time. I’m currently on olanzapine 10mg do you think I should increase my dose. I was also taking Maca root and _PERSON_ not sure if their was some interaction with my olanzapine.

175911450,"So I don’t know if vaping is healthier or not, you are inhaling water vapour with chemicals as opposed to smoke with chemicals which certainly sounds healthier on paper, the problem is which chemicals are you inhaling. I have to do something to change up, so I’m going to try it, although so far I admit that I still prefer roll ups. At the end of the day, both cigarettes and e-cigs have side affects, like all medication. Healthy people don’t need medication. Thank you."

174331468,Its really your psychiatrist who will decide the steps and dosage to reduce. We’re not psychiatrists. You did say only Abilify works for you? Maybe ask your psy a prn of Abilify to take in case Vraylar doesn’t work. I hope Vraylar works for you bcz you had similar problems as me with Abilify.

175911462,"So today’s morning something weird happened. I was watching the news. Everything was normal at first, but then the reporters mentioned that some bank was about to go bankrupt, and I immediately got a feeling that they were trying to hint that my remote (I was holding it in my hand) was connected to that bank and was draining it and causing the bank to go bankrupt. For some reason I found it funny and couldn’t stop laughing, then both of the reporters had a very stern expression, so I figured that it was inappropriate to laugh. I forced myself to stop laughing by biting my tongue and slapping my own cheeks. Then I put the remote away and the other reporter smiled."
175911463,How necessary were they? I don’t believe in checkups. When I’m cleanly living I figure they’re just looking for trouble and might even invent it.

175911468,I watch tv in the evening it makes me sleepy slowly. Sometimes in the afternoon listening music channels when im bored and have nothing to do. I think TV calms me down idk how this is even possible.

175911470,I don’t mind being around other people so long as they don’t hassle me.

175911484,"I can’t think of the right word but schizophrenia is not one of the more “popular” diseases. Cancer, heart disease, diabetes etc. are the diseases most publicized and most familiar diseases in most peoples minds which means they get the most money towards research for a cure. Schizophrenia research gets put on the back burner when it comes to finding a cure. It still gets researched for a cure but not on a scale of the three diseases I mentioned."

175911486,Welcome back. Hope you will enjoy the forum again. I remember ya.
175911487,Yeah I thought it more depression/bi polar. It’s hard to consider these things in retrospect as their clinical methods weren’t too scientific.

I did and do nothing with my life. It’s sad. Schizophrenia made is 100x-1000x worse. Even doctors don’t understand. I come off as lazy. I can drink 10 monsters a day and still do nothing.

175911497,"Well, when I’m working on something, I may talk to myself things like: “so now I put it here and this there. Oh, no! God! I have to use Ctrl + Z now. Let me think about a new approach to this, hmmm, yeah, I got a new idea!” and so on. I don’t generally answer myself, but it may happen. There are some kinds of therapeutical exercises that encourage you talking to yourself (if so, never in front of other people). When you’re writing a journal, you’re basically talking to yourself. But I think it would be a problem if you can’t control it and maybe become most of the time the character that is in your head. I read books about normal people who have entire conversations with different characters they play in their heads."

175911519,He’s doing really well. Seems to have everything under control so far. I talked to my daughter she is claiming she will take the kids every other week. But she won’t tell me where she is staying. And yesterday she yelled at me for seeing her kids and not informing her. I don’t know who she thinks she is.
175911520,"I’m leaving in a little bit. I’m planning on talking about the excoriation disorder. It’s pretty bad right now. I have over 30 wounds. I doubt she can do anything to help but it’s worth a try, it can’t hurt. I’ll also talk about my daughter, as always. And I’ll update her on the housing situation and such. I’m sure she’ll just cut it short like she normally does. Maybe I’ll ask her why her sessions are so short today and see if there’s a legitimate reason like having to do notes or something. But still other therapists have to do notes and they see you for at least 50 minutes, she cuts me off at like 40 minutes. That seems almost rude."

175911521,It’s a tough choice to be ethical in this modern world where everyone is selling out to economics. Your right. All you can do is concentrate on what you touch. Yes you can boycott but only if you go to a local retailer and support them for instance. I’m poor. It’s easy to be environmentally conscious when you’ve money. You can buy out of the rat race but I need to buy from China and I need to get by. All’s I’d suggest is keep local if possible. For example. I shop at a major retailer but I will go through a checkout even if I wait rather than a self checkout. At least give a teenager some more money!

I new my grown son had lost hair on such medicine years ago, so I knew what the deal was, and I attempted to get myself off that b/p medicine and onto another. It wasn't easy. I had to stay positive. The first couple of doctors I asked about that, no. The third doctor I asked hesitated, but I really, really wanted to get off of that medicine and she changed me. I quit having hair loss. Some years ago, I had another health ailment and it was explained to me that it was caused by the very medicine that was making me better. Double bind. Inside and out I protested. It didn't do any good. I still had to take the medicine. So this could be the situation you are in. Yeah, it crushed me.

175911644,"I’m beginning to think this concept applies to me. No entry exists on Wikipedia, (and the affliction is not officially diagnosable) but the site does steer you toward what’s called ‘The Coffeehouse Effect’. Apparently the “human brain is naturally, thus constantly, in search of ‘novelty’”. And as an example the coffeehouse provides us with a “new environment”. Polarizing for me is that this novelty causes an uptick in dopamine, which increases motivation, performance, and creativity. From Wikipedia: Sociologists and psychologists have studied the phenomena from a cultural and social point of view, discovering that background noises, and having people around, can [also] increase one’s brain productivity. I had a mini breakthrough learning about this topic. My room at home is actually decorated like a café… and I’ve been frequenting one literally and consistently for the past year. It’s nice to hear the overall concept is apparently typical of entrepreneurs as well. I do 
produce ideas and liken myself as a creative. But at the same time it’s a ‘disease of distraction’(Shiny Object Syndrome, this is), so learning to curb the drawbacks is important. According to what I read, and what resonated the most, is first you have to discover your purpose(on the planet, is all). Helpful to me is here was some concise phrasing to help me understand this, it is: ‘Look within; or do without(The shiny object). It’s difficult for me because I feel like these things(for me at least) are hard to separate, and are intertwined; worse I’m not sure entirely what that all says here. Am I too superficial? There must be more than to me than that. Still in a business sense out of college I worked for a well renowned luxury company(jewelry; gifts). And I seem to be circling back to that industry in a much more passionate and profound way today. Only this time developing an eye for fashion [in the context of my young niece who loves it too]. Last but not least - it’s not lost on me that inn
ate in all of this we are dealing with the topic of commitment(to ideas; at a minimum). Fashion changes with seasons, and wardrobes contain variety. Plus I’m only an applicant,(getting ahead of myself, clearly) which is (all of it) part and parcel of the ‘disease’. Maybe fashion (to me) is about intrigue; although maybe it’s 60/40 when you factor expression in. People make impressions on me easily, I always remind myself that when everything is taken into consideration, I am quick to ‘like’ and (feel I) or strive to be, a little less quick to ‘dislike’. Still it’s a certain sensitivity technically and it’s up to me to make good on this internal monologue. I do think it’s a good model to live by which is why I am sharing. _AT_MENTION_, Thanks for the topic!"

175911648,"I can give you some tips. I blog, and have this on my site as smoking cessation based on mindfulness. Good luck: First, see if you can get your hands on nicotine patches/gum. In California, there is a program where they ship you a 4 week supply of patches free of charge and make follow-up calls to monitor your progress. When you decide your quit date, use the patch with a “new start” attitude. When you begin to have a craving, resist. Keep resisting and notice just how difficult it is to do this. I can’t stress the importance of mindfulness at this moment: feel the pressure, the stress of the moment. It make take all of your will. If you absolutely cannot do it, do something you don’t want to do: for me, this meant house chores. I’d sweep, wash, scrub, get my hands dirty type cleaning. If you find that a few minutes (and the craving) have passed, great! When the craving strikes again, recall how difficult it was to resist the urge and the feelings associated with it; you can think it, wri
te it down, or simply just verbalize it. Use this as a platform for future refusals. For me, on that first day, the cravings hit hard and often. I recalled in my mind the painstaking will it took to refuse the cigarette and repeated this affirmation: I will not allow my hard work go to waste. Supplement your quitting by removing lighters, matches, cig coupons or anything that may cause a relapse. Keep your things (your residence, bills, plans, etc) in order. Simplified with a step by step guide: Pick planned quit date Use cessation aid (patch, gum, pill) on quit day When urges strike, resist if you cannot resist, do something you do not want to do (ex. chores) until the urge passes Stay present during urges monitor, write, verbalize core feeling during the urge and resistance Recall core feeling when urges strike again Use affirmation (I will not allow my hard work to go to waste) Supplemental activities to avoid relapse Keep things around you orderly As days mount, the urges decrease as does the nicotine dep
endence"
175911649,Oh definitely. 100%. And don’t feel ashamed about it.
175911650,"One time my sophmore year in wrestling I got so dehydrated making weight that I gained twelve pounds over night when I decided to go up a weight. I increased my body weight by ten percent over night. I once saw this boxer on tv who had gained fifteen pounds over night by replacing his fluids after dehydrating. He weighed 175 lbs. , though, so he didn’t increase his weight by ten percent over night. It’s possible to gain and lose a lot of weight by manipulating the fluids in your system. What you do is bundle up in rubber sweats and wrestle or run, and every fifteen minutes of hard sweating is a pound of lost weight. I had a wrestling coach who used to sweat out 20 lbs in a week during his college career. If I had to lose more than seven or eight pounds by dehydrating something just left me, and I couldn’t perform on the _NAME_. I think the problem was that I was on a very high protein diet. I’ve heard that protein is hard on your kidneys. When you’re operating at that kind of calorie defi
cit almost all of the food you eat is going to be burnt for energy. I should have been getting about half the protein I was getting. Also, I didn’t worry too much about my sodium. I would eat a can of tuna and congratulate myself on all the protein I was getting, but I wasn’t thinking about the sodium."

It’s been around since 1885 and I’m paying the same price for if I were to go in person I think. I actually searched dozens of uni’s for this particular major I wanted. Harvard had this option too for working adults but it was just way too expensive and I would have had to gone through a one year process just to get in plus I would’ve had to travel to Cambridge. I’m like that would’ve been cool but I’m already 30 and it just would’ve been too expensive. I only mention Harvard because I signed up there before going back this uni. Only cuz the price and process. I don’t wanna wait a year. I would’ve been super excited for the challenge of H but I’m not waiting a whole dang year or more at 1000 per course. No. And cuz financial aid wouldn’t have paid for the pre-courses. Ugh. No. But I would’ve loved to do it.

Say things like ‘who is that walking’ o it’s italy’ he looks good must have been working out or they’d say he looks skinny no wonder his gf dumped him. They were also grandiose when I thought I looked good, I would hear girls saying as I walked by ‘wow hot’ or some might say ‘no way rank’ (like if it was two girls I’d hear the other one say to the other one ) One time working in a field at the bottom of the hill from one of my neighbours house I thought he was watching me from an old _NAME_ parked outside his yard with a telescope. You couldn’t see his house even it was covered in tress it’s just this old _NAME_ I could see, I thought he was watching me using a telescope

174331508,"Does it bother you we live in a simulation or Matrix? If so why? Do you feel powerless or paranoid? Like you have no control or that reality isn’t real? I had that paranoia and fear and panic everyday for 7 years. I got over it with proper therapy, time, medication, and logical thinking. I learned not to let it bother me; I learned not to care; and most importantly, I learned that it’s probably the most logical explanation for our existence. Base reality is probably boring and worse off than this life. Schizophrenia sucks plain and simple. Maybe you are looking for an explanation for your cause whether supernatural or metaphysical. But rest assured it’s probably just bad luck and all those thoughts and experiences are not based in actual reality. Simulation theory is based on probability. That there are more simulated universes than actual ones and we are probably living in one now. But I think that’s flawed. Maybe base reality is a lot different or the physics is different in another unive
rse. I don’t know. Maybe our life cannot exist without simulations like this one. Does that give you solace? It does for me. It’s either very likely we live in an AI dreamworld or the laws of physics are isomorphic or exactly like that but it’s not; meaning we are very real. It’s two interpretations. I think the former is the truth and much more likely. You will get better with time. Either you will accept it, deny it, or learn not to care and learn not to try to figure everything out. It’s similar to the belief in God, a higher power or aliens. Some people just have certain belief and thoughts about that stuff. It bothers some people and it doesn’t bother other people. Some people just don’t care or think or obsess about those things. We really don’t know. If you really want answers, maybe get another college degree or something. Maybe in some completely different field that relaxes your mind yet stimulates it at the same time. You could do art or maybe computer science. A lot of problems are 
unsolved, yet interesting in that field. You could be famous or make money. Most importantly, you could find a purpose in life and move on from your schizophrenia. I’m trying to do that."

175911747,"I think it's good that you are on medicine, especially as a believed to be bipolar, you're on an anti-depressant and a stabilizer. You said the antidepressant(s) made you want to fight for no reason. I take Ativan tranquilizer for a health reason, and they say that can make you combative, and I think I believe that. So I know about that kind of side effect. You said, ""I feel better yet don't know if I'm just hopeful to get better."" I think your hopeful to get better can play a part in your possible improvement. I was negative for many years, from childhood training or maybe my bipolar, or a combination of that. Then I read a column on being positive before going into a problem that you can solve it. What it did was, it opened up my unconscious looking for ways to win, rather than my unconscious negative (which I didn't know I had) looking for ways to lose, like I had programed it in both cases. I realized when I did that, believing I could solve the problem before I started to try to solve it (by 
saying to myself, ""think positive, think positive, think positive""), I was 200 percent better at solving problems. So, I'm thinking if we're looking for ways to stay sick, we can find them. And if we're looking for ways to get well, we have a better chance at finding that. Are you generally positive? Did you come from a positive household? As for sleep, I use Melatonin health food. But I think if you're taking a new medicine, you'd want to check with your doctor to see if the medicine will help you get to sleep. To see how well the medicine does with that."

I was trying to explain how I am to my therapist. The schiz part. She said she has never worked or maybe said has limited work, with people with schizophrenia diagnoses. She mentioned that I have really bad paranoid thinking. I said I’m legitimately scared, yes, that bad things will happen to me constantly like someone trying to kill me or just anything really. But I told her sometimes I can hear myself saying the weird thoughts to people, but subconsciously some of the thoughts I don’t believe especially when I’m on meds.

175911751,_AT_MENTION_ I feel like everyone is connected by the music when I go to a gig. But everyone plotting against you? That sounds paranoid or maybe even delusional if it’s become a fixed belief. I agree with goldenrex - it sounds ok if the symptom subsided after the festival.
175911752,Ive taken everything trying to get off it. I am on another Ap and its fine i just cannot get off the clozapine
175911753,Good job! I made similar changes but I also have a calorie limit
174331525,Clozapine is a good drug. You have to get a blood test once a month for that one though

175911756,It’s a great passtime and a natural anti-depressant. I use my imagination instead of porn so as to keep the brain and mind aspects of sexual desire alive. It takes more effort but I find it more entertaining after a while.
175911757,"Thank you so much for your reply. I do feel angry with them a lot, but I feel so guilty for it. They have done so much for me and I don't feel like bringing the issue up and making tension between us again. I know they were in a tough spot, not sure how to react or help him. They would always give good ideas and solutions while talking but never speak with him about it. I'm very sorry to hear of your childhood. My real father sexually abused me when I was just a tiny girl, just a toddler and I still remember it. I have dealt with a consuming fear of men my whole life, even other family members scared me. A couple years ago I was able to come to terms with it. I hadnt remembered about the abuse until I found and read a diary entry from when I was in grade school and it all came rushing back. I had remembered it in 1st grade, but somehow my mind blocked it at some point since then. My fear of men was more explained then. I researched on my own about adult childhood abuse and was able to wrap my head 
around a lot of my struggles and quirks. I can work alongside men at my workplace now without feeling scared for my life, I've made huge accomplishments with it. I still feel uncomfortable around men, but having a known cause to work through made a huge difference and allowed me to redirect my fear and uncertainty away from undeserving males. It sounds like you have made good standing with your trauma. You are so brave and strong to be able to overcome that. And now you are here supporting others with their own issues and helping people. In case you havent heard this in a while, I am very proud of you. You have beaten your trauma and become a wonderful person."

175911759,"sorry, just saying sorry its a stressful time for us all and i seem to be very over sensitive atm, little things set me off idk why, i need to discuss it with my dr, idk how to handle my moods atm, so i’m saying sorry, i am trying to stick to the rules, i sometimes get side tracked though, something tells me to do this and do that and i just do whatever it says, it sort of controls me, its telling me to apologise and jsut say i am really trying to stick to the rules, i never wanted to break the rules but i did, i didnt mean to cause any trouble. just saying i am trying my best but i do still have some symptoms i think, i think they are symptoms but i am not sure."

174331526,"Treebeard you are correct, but I have worked as a health economist briefly and can tell you that much of medical knowledge has only been verified statistically. This is why a doctors best judgment based on his/her experience is still valued so highly and people often have to experiment (in conjunction with a doctor) as to the best course of treatment for them. In the case of theoretical understanding of Schizophrenia, very little is known, and the assessment of treatment is still based mostly on statistics and people’s experiences."

Some websites and dating websites are just full of bots designed to exploit men. I am an American and I believe in Freedom of Speech. But I’ve been censored and mistreated for speaking against sexual behavior. So while sex criminals are seemingly not penalized for their speech, I get penalized for mine. Of course, this might be because sex criminals have a strong influence on the internet. They exploit men and gather money to bribe some websites. I also believe in Freedom of Religion, which is also protected under the American Bill of Rights. But a lot of websites don’t want people discussing religion. So those websites aren’t truly American. Coincidentally enough, 
religion is used in some societies to counter crime. Any idiot can put two and two together, and I wish I didn’t have to communicate on the internet during this pandemic.

When you get overwhelmed, stop immedaitaely, and find your balance, maybe by meditation or go outside and be one with nature. When you know that one thing you want to do, make sure you do it when you best perform. I perform well around noon, so that's when I start writing and researching. Do you have ways to cope when you have mood changes? If I get very agitated I occasioncally will take a benzo to calm the nerves, or have a beer, or sit in the shed and listen to the rustling leaves, watching them dance in the light. Sometimes ill have a beer and be out it the shed doing that. Also, if you do want to slowly tackle a big project, you have to divide it into smaller bits, maybe you can use a planner or a calender, maybe even a app on your phone. I prefer paper though. Phones can distract. But you gotta break the project up in smaller and smaller bits so you 
can stay focused on one thing. Your web browser sounds cluttered. You have to think of your room and your computer as the externalization of your mind.

I’m not understanding your question?” You said in your first post, “I have no desire to harm myself but anxious thoughts come to me about it and it so scary…. please tell me I’m not the only one who experiences that due to anxiety” Well, you pretty much answered the question right there. The only reason you have anxious thoughts about harming yourself is due to anxiety. I thought maybe you had been in a very difficult situation, something like trauma. But you answered that in your first post: that you experience things strictly from anxiety. Well, see, I didn’t know that. I missed that part. So you just have a lot of anxiety. And you’re taking Citalopram anti-depressant is 20 mg. So, I’m wondering in addition to your medicine, could you try CBT, or positive thinking to help you with your anxiety? You said, ""yes my family is pretty much negative always expecting the worst and “predicting it”, I have never hear them say hey I have a 
feeling this is going to go well ....total Opposite ...so I guess learned from them"" I'm saying, my family was negative, also, and negative things tended to stay negative until I read a column on being positive going into a problem that you could solve it. It helped me and I was wanting to give some of that information to you. What do you think?"

174331571,"… schizophrenia at forty plus. Life passes you by and you realise the struggle disguises that nobody has ever loved you and also that you have never lived… especially so, it disguises that sometimes you are right and not deluded which is when criminal behaviour is rife because it disguises abuse. I am always alone. What a delusion that a poorer man could be romantic enough to love me or make me wanted. By year 14, he not only managed my medication plan with a psychiatric team; I was so doped up that even my neighbours encouraged him to act selfishly whilst I looked greedy, inhibited, confused, dopey, poverty stricken and undesirable. It became a situation from where he seemed “wow and loving” and I reciprocated as a North West Londoner with money, life and soul. However, once the security of home and marriage in a new village had passed our feelings about relationships and commitment were incongruent and so he made new friendships : I didn’t, he went to work : I struggled in temporary job
s : I felt tired : he got on with life, I had no family : he managed my relationships, I cleaned the home : he chose what to do with it… All along the inability to think alongside constant sedation subjected me to a situation I was unable to see. You know, I mentioned moments to my councillor who raised the term “Good and Good enough”… I was scared to mention that Good Enough was not Good enough but I am unable to say why whilst although a knife was held above my head, I was sedated that night with the help of my neighbours. Basically, nobody believed me. Latterly still having noone to turn to, the medication was so strong I kept suffering continued memory loss. This is the begining now. I took control 8 weeks ago. I am managing my own problems. Regardless of age and middle age by the way, as a person still waiting for a full loving day, I intend to write about my experience of childhood and life as an unwanted schizophrenic. Today is 2020.

I know it's two APs but the Abilify helps my depression and the Zyprexa helps my anxiety and psychosis. It just seems like my pdoc and I should not change things from this point on.

Feels like crap first few times but with practice, you’ll be able to handle it and when it pops up again, you can be like “hey, got through this before; can get thru it again”. In fact, I don’t think I’m wrong when I say focusing on the negative now is one of the steps toward enlightenment that is touted by Buddhist schools. By default, we are trained by family and society to avoid the negative. To distract the mind. But focusing on our inner awareness, thoughts during negative states has helped me greatly with my sz."

175912012,"Sorry to hear that you're going through this. No, my parents were not religious. I didn't even know what religion was until my teachers in school started educating us about it. My one teacher said ""Now, I assume you're probably all Christian"" and I didn't even know what he meant. This was 10th grade, I was 15. I too was very hyper active, and all my teachers told me I was a gifted child, and I had people put me down here and there, yes, but there is no such thing as mind reading. There is no such thing as broadcasting or gang-stalking. These are delusions. Psychosis is real, I've suffered from it. I've been hospitalized for it, and I've been treated for it. Believe me, I had the same delusions you did. I thought I was a god, that would one day take over the world, and everyone would bow before me. I get help. I saw a therapist for years before he moved away. I still see a psychiatrist. I see him every 3 months, and I'm a lot happier than what I was back in 2011 when I was untreated. Trust me, if

I think people who haven’t had a serious mental illness are a little scared of sz because it is in the realm of the unknown. It’s one of those diseases that is really hard to relate to if you haven’t had it yourself. Before I got sz I didn’t know what it was about at all and I certainly didn’t think it would happen to me. But in the end anything can happen to anyone, it’s just a matter of circumstances, but not many people have that kind of mentality. I had to learn it the hard way. I have a few friends who know that I have the illness, but it’s not something that we talk about. I don’t feel the need to talk about it either. At work most people don’t know I have this illness.

Diabetes can be managed with medication as well as diet and exercise. Even if you go off your antipsychotic there is no guarantee your diabetes will go away, unless you lose a lot of weight and follow a strict regimen of diet and exercise. If you don’t think you can do that (especially while being psychotic) it is probably better you just go on diabetes meds and workout and eat better while staying on your APs."
175912034,"My mother and her father were abusive when I was a child and teenager. But once I moved out, things changed, though my grandfather died just before I moved out. The pattern seemed to be that they bullied those that were dependant on them. Grandfather bullied his wife all the time."

To repeat myself, both can lay risk to psychosis if stay too long, but I believe I'm beginning to be able to take it and apply it as an effective coping mechanism. Sort of - almost. So are you saying you think it's a choice? That a schizoid straight out chooses to neglect others in favor of their own world? Or would this be along the lines of ""autistic thinking""? By your definition, mine is just maladaptive daydreaming. Magical thinking is separate to the fantasy world, and the fantasy world doesn't confuse my perception of reality, but sometimes I can't come back from ""dreaming"". That's probably the dissociation though. This is weird to think about. I never knew it was a thing. I tried mentioning things like this to a shrink when I was younger, but felt embarrassed and changed the subject. I find it more uncomfortable than talking about psychosis. I felt like they looked

175912054,Welcome. It’s all about function. If your life is suffering from what you are experiencing then you need to address that. If you’ve a broken arm you’ll seek help because it’s sore. If you’ve something wrong with your brain you’ll justify that everything is normal. What you are describing can be a symptom of mental illness. Changes in time and perception are common but we are all different. IT’s important to be honest with your treating team/provider and take what pills they give you at least for a period of 6 weeks minimum it would seem. Welcome to the community.

Twenty-nine psychiatric inpatients in open wards participated in the study. The study group viewed humorous and the control group viewed neutral movies daily for 3 months. Participants were assessed before and after viewing movies with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale, Calgary Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, the Multinomah Community Ability Scale, the Insight and Treatment Attitude Questionnaire, and the Working Alliance Inventory. Reduced levels of psychopathology, anger, anxiety, and depression symptoms and an improvement in social competence were revealed in t

175912105,"I currently take Risperdal. It seems to be a detriment to my cognition. I also have had trouble being productive, due to side effects that include oversleeping (12-15 hours) and difficulty concentrating, for more than two years. I want to get a job or go to school, but this AP is an obstruction. Back in April or May, my pdoc gave me a sample of Latuda, but I didn’t get around to taking it due to switching to a new pdoc after an insurance change. I recently read that Latuda is “distinguished by its high affinity for serotonin 5-HT7 receptors […] The serotonin 5-HT7 receptor is a target of interest that may be associated with the potential for both pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706192/ Has anyone here switched from Risperdal or another AP, to Latuda and exhibited better cognition?"

175912119,"I had akathisia and urges to harm others, which was a brand new thing for me. I had received three shots, and it took about 3 or 4 months after stopping for side effects to stop. Be careful, if you get an injection and have bad side effects, you’re stuck with them for awhile. It takes a lot longer for injected meds to leave your system than pills. I’d try invega in pill form first, and if it doesn’t give you side effects (and some people do well on it, everybody reacts differently) then you can move to the injection. My two cents at least."

My pdoc is a guy and i’m really happy with him. He helped me very well. I wonder how that female therapist you went to can say that what you been through isn’t traumatic… not everything is the same for everybody… so it’s weird how they can say that.

175912236,"Well, maybe just a little. I posted about a year and a half ago that I am actually worse off and more screwed up than just about anyone else on this site. I was half-joking, half-serious and half-depressed. I have the days where my future doesn’t look rosy and I have serious doubts about the future. I’m a broken, stunted, withdrawn man and probably never truly looked anyone in the eye in my whole life. I’m 58 years old but my eyes have been closed through most of it. Yes, I know what I’ve accomplished, but I’m talking about functioning and relating to other people like a two year old. Occasionally, in my defense, I kind of picture my future sitting on a porch in a rocking chair, sipping some lemonade with friends, family and neighbors and relating tales of the few things I’ve done. But, instead I’ll probably keep working until I retire or my health gets worse. Always, always, always on the outside looking in. I just had to get that off my chest."
175912237,"Good morning all. I'm having a rough day. Depression is kicking my butt. Hallucinations are good though. I had a T appointment last night which helped but I didn't leave feeling as stable as I would have liked. Monday's T appointment really destabilized me so I am having to work doubly hard to get back on track. I feel like I am out of energy though. I'm worn out. Too much fighting with myself. My thoughts are having to battle my feelings. I had to take some Xanax this morning when I got to work. I know that is weird because Xanax is a depressant but my chest was tight and I was having trouble breathing so I think I was having some anxiety too. I really came close to calling into work today. I probably should have stayed home and did some self care. That would have been better. I thought coming to work might help...it might help me get distracted. I'm not distracted. I'm just....here, struggling. I didn't manage to shower today. I'll do it tomorrow. I took care of the cats and fed the dog and took

175912240,"Yes I know that animal cruelty is way up but so is spousal and child abuse to alarming levels. I am on FB a lot and see posting of crimes against children and animals so many times a day it is saddening and it is hard to grasp at the numbers. Parents and grandparents binding kids, starving them, abusing them. Read a story yesterday 6 year was bound with his hands and arms behind him for two months and kept in a shed by his grandmother and her boyfriend because he was hungry and ""stole"" food from the fridge because he was hungry. According to the neighbors he had not been seen since the end of school and according to the grandmother had only been that way for two weeks. Regardless of how long it was why did this happen at all. I have worked mental health off and on since I was 21 and it is definitely getting worse. But I also know that the help isn't there like it used to be and that there is a huge _USER_ID_ around MH that many add to I feel out of fear of the unknown. Look at how the media plays 
it too they play murders up by saying that a person who may have ""low intelligence"" is not responsible for their actions when their may be much more in their history that could actually pinpoint their issues or be used to exonerate them but it does not excuse the crimes committed. Plus I think personally that this pandemic is also being used as an excuse to release some of the worse fear with the release of people from the jails and allowing them their freedom to commit more crimes without getting the needed treatment for their mental health issues."

I’m normal and I’m scared I’m a liar. Nothing is real and everything is real. I don’t know what to believe anymore. I guess I’m just a drama queen who wants to pretend to be psychotic because she wants to be a victim. I’m a fool I guess. I hate myself. I’m just a f***ing liar. I hate my f***ing mother in law. Sometimes I wish she were dead so she wouldn’t be in our lives anymore. She hates me even though she pretends to care for me. She still wants to poison me but is just waiting for the right moment. I’m scared of her. I don’t want to share this with my husband because I don’t want to hurt him. It’s his mother after all. But I don’t trust her. She’s not a bad person but i think underneath she’s still plotting to harm me. I guess I’m hell bound I’m a bad person if I hate like this. I’m guil

175912245,"Very few people with bipolar disorder get much physical activity. 78% are reported to lead sedentary lives. For those who do exercise, little is known about the effect of exercise on this mood disorder. And yet, some people maintain that vigorous exercise can bring on manic episodes. Could this be true? Well, yes and no. The ways exercise can help those with depression are well-researched and overwhelmingly positive. Regular physical activity can lift a person’s mood from despair to upbeat, and many of the physical symptoms of depression can be improved by exercise. Results of research into the effects of activity on depression lead many to believe that exercise should be considered a primary therapy when treating depression. For people with bipolar disorder that tend toward mania, the results are a little murkier. No one is advocating for a sedentary lifestyle. No one thinks inactivity is good for those with bipolar disorder. The level of activity is what’s in question. https://blogs.psychcent

I’m actually getting better, day by day. The only other thing I’d suggest is avoiding gluten, gliadin and soda. Those are the killers. I eat bread and I get arthritis flareups, and my head situation doesn’t feel that great afterwards, either. Like I will literally regress in terms of recovery if I drink enough soda in a day. Avoid fried / junk food if possible. Keep it homemade, if not perfectly healthy. Some sugar is OK, like the amount in tea, but too much is going to give you problems. Limit dairy as well, that might be a trigger. Maybe 1 cup a day at most (ideally spread out in tea / coffee servings.)"

175912367,Yeah I have they just want to drug me up
175912368,I see. That sounds really distressing. Sorry that happened to you. One of my old delusions was that people could hear my thoughts if I looked them in the eyes. Needless to say I never looked at anyone ever.

175912370,Today I am 34 years old
175912371,We are not looking for aide. We just want people to stop hating us because we’re Asians. I decided to write this post because I was worried in case people would have delusions about the coronavirus.
175912372,"So I guess I hear voices to start. Children crying and laughing but mostly crying. Somtime’s I can’t tell if they are hurt or having fun. Playgrounds are hard for me. This happens a lot outside or when I sit by open windows. Somtime’s I have to go inside or close the window. Then I have debilitating paranoia where I can’t do anything but sit and try not to think. I will be so scared that “they” will get me or I’ll be scared to eat because “they” don’t want me to. There’s lots of things I can’t do sometimes because they tellme they will hurt me if I do. When the worst psychosis happens, I travel to a very dark, bleak place and I feel powerless to help myself. Then sometimes, “they” will talk to me or I will just know what they want and I will have conversations in my head with them. I have yet to tell anyone who these people are even tho i know who they are because that would add to their power. I have delusions that these people have already killed my family and that the
y want to kill me. Recently a new delusion was brought up to my attention that told me that i had met a doctor who practiced hypnosis and his existence ment that the other bad people weren’t real But i know that he’s a delusion and that makes me sad. I think that’s about the most that I can think of. I’m not sure if this replyis public or private but it doesn’t really matter i guess…i hope it helps you"
175912373,"Hearing voices made me feel like I was sexually abused, although I had not been. I was also mad about people pandering to feelings of interdependancy, like their mommies dumb things down for them. I took it too personally. In this way there were many loops, like I’d deviated or degenerated. I had to vent my negativity, but I was too angry. I had to live with my negative thoughts and understand my many negative or unwanted thoughts. I felt like alienation, or chaos, like I’d look at space pictures or think about _NAME_, instead of just allowing these other thoughts. There is a real problem with some of a persons thinking in other terms then. I mean, I didn’t think very much like about 1984, or a Clockwork Orange, as much as somebody else, although if I read them there could be too many thoughts like that. It was almost like a person who thinks there is a microchip implanted in their brain, or that persons are sexually abusing them to reach these thoughts. This leads to the conclusion that many 
schizophrenics hate god. There are arguments also that TV causes some emotional insteability that schizophrenics struggle following TV, yet are angry or alienated about other people in society as TV heads who thrive on it when as schizophrenics they don’t envjoy it, are disadvantaged. And then there’s the feeling like ambivilance, that Schizophrenics can do one thing but not others, like they can fix dinner or do chores but not raise children, or work a satisfying career."

175912376,"No i still have them, although I’m not delusional anymore and I’m better at keeping my lips locked and insight about my old delusions"
175912377,Something else I have been thinking about is the tendency of sz to have religious experiences. I do not know if religious prophets had sz or if it is the religious discourses that sz relates to. My own experience is not having religious delusions or hallucinations but at one time i was preoccupied with christianity and when the police detained me they confiscated a bible i was carrying. When i consider sz a phenomena my own pet theory is that the disorder amplifies normal brain functions to the point of disorder. Most people are religious so they think god is watching them and a normal social mind constantly thinks what others would think of whatever they are doing at any time. So it is normal to think and behave that others are watching you. I just think that voices are amplified internal voices and delusions are corruptions of our interpretation of reality and thinking others are watching or controlling is the regular perception gone awry. Afterall why would the brain do something it doesnt do jus
t because some neurotransmitters are being overproduced and recieved by too many synapsis.
175912378,_AT_MENTION_ nobody promises that life will get better but there’s always tomorrow. That’s the motto I live by.

175912390,"As I read through different forums most seem way to exactly like what everyone wants me to think is going on.

However, I’ve been wondering if anyone is social in their various environments such as work and school. It’s something that I’ve struggle with greatly, besides the positive-symptoms that has become manageable in most cases. It’s just I have this instinct to retreat and be alone when pursued in social environments. I’ve figured manning up would help also but I over think a lot lol. Any tips would be helpful. Thanks"
175912395,Does that mean like talkative? I can be social in the right setting. Here on this forum I feel extremely awkward Hahaha ha. But some rare times I do feel social. Like on one or two of my mental health courses it all depends on whose around and how good I’m feeling in myself that day!

174331686,"I was feeling down so I made a few notes of what made me feel better and I want to share it. The side effect of DMT is that you never stop talking about it. It's like the entities want you to share it with everyone to save the world from destruction right before the end is near. Like you've been inducted into some weird secret society. On the schizophrenia subreddit, people have found a cult website that wants people with schizophrenia to smoke it to cure them and I think that that is really sad. I don't believe AT ALL that you guys should do psychedelics. And what all the hippies try to explain how the answer to everything gets whispered in the ear and can't remember what that was but the calmness and sense of peace of the answer stays with you. Like you're not allowed to understand it completely but you're left feeling like ""Oh.. ok.. Now I don't need to freak out anymore"". You find yourself grasping for the depression and the darkness and it's gone and you're like ""Wtf? What is this?"". You d
o it a few times and then the psychedelic says, ""Ok. You know what you need to know. But not the whole truth. Now you can run with it"". I just feel like I was being pulled in by the devil this morning. Like I don't know which side of the paradox to believe in. All the mystical things aren't true but I know they're true. I have proof myself. I just got slightly delusional. And that is my story for today.. I'd prefer if you ignore me and just think of this as rhetorical babble. What I'm trying to say is that you don't need to trip when I can tell you about the Gods. Then we can continue to take our antipsychotics and be at peace with ourselves, knowing the secret that we aren't supposed to know 100%. And I believe I'm being very logical right now just by saying that =]"

But for about two months they scared me every day because I thing he’s been homeless or in prison and every day they generated so much tension and craziness and it was so thick in any room in my house that you could cut it with a knife. Then after two months I discovered two things. One: it was the damn woman doing it. And two: she put me through a lot of changes and was wrecking my life in some ways but it was all mind games.

175912426,"So, my mom and I watched a movie and we picked up my brother. We came home and obviously, the dogs are barking non-stop because they are so so excited to see us. I’m used to the dogs barking so I gently hugged the dogs. However, my brother suddenly lashed out at our rescued dog, a _NAME_, and tried to kick him. I was like “what are you doing?” and my mom said to him, “it’s not good to hurt animals!” My brother then came to the living room and threw his wallet on the sofa, and he said “I’m sick of this dog barking at me so loudly! It hurts my ears!” My mom yelled at him and said that it was not good to hurt animals (once again) and that his behaviour was not appropriate. I told him that a best way to stop a dog from barking is to extend his hand and say “no”. He said, “Well, you could’ve hugged the dog instead!” and he slammed the door. Cocoa is a rescue so he has traumas. He was shaking so violently and I had to separate him from the situation. I hugged _PERSON_ and told 
him it was alright. He shook for some time but he was alright. And needless to say that I’m scared. I hate these situations."

175912428,"There is a search on the forum where you should be able to type in Lexapro (or if you can remember the name of the thread) and posts will come up about it. I am pretty sure that is how it works. I'll try to find for you if I have time later. I take my Lexapro in the morning with other meds. Today I didn't have it. I can't get it until 3:00. So far I feel okay. But am anxious for that time to come so I can go and get it at the pharmacy. Yes, there is no sense to go on Effexor if the Lexapro usually works for you. Effexor can be hard to come off of. When I switched to Pristiq it wasn't bad, but one time I went off cold turkey and it was scary. I didn't think I needed it and come to find out that was because it was working for me. Crazy things we do at times. I hope you have a good day and good luck with taking it in the evening. I hope it helps. Hugs, _NAME_... PS I took Zoloft before and it made everybody gain weight and it made me lose. Strange how meds can effect people so differently."

It is actually a gift of bpd some of us are given.. My lifes’ losses and traumas have finally taken more than I have to give.

So much pain we endured, then we get a disorder that makes us feel that pain ten times more intensely than pwout bpd . I begged for help. For healing , for a miracle.

Deciphering the molecular networks that distinguish organ-confined disease from metastatic disease may lead to the identification of critical biomarkers for cancer invasion 
and disease aggressiveness. Although gene and protein expression have been extensively profiled in human tumours, little is known about the global metabolomic alterations that characterize neoplastic progression. Using a combination of high-throughput liquid-and-gas-chromatography-based mass spectrometry, we profiled more than 1,126 metabolites across 262 clinical samples related to prostate cancer (42 tissues and 110 each of urine and plasma). These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish benign prostate, clinically localized prostate cancer and metastatic disease. Sarcosine, an N-methyl derivative of the amino acid glycine, was identified as a differential metabolite that was highly increased during prostate cancer progression to metastasis and can be detected non-invasively in urine. Sarcosine levels were also increased in invasive prostate cancer cell lines relative to benign prostate epithelial cells. Knockdown of glycine-N-methyl transferase, the enzyme that generates sarcosine from glyci
ne, attenuated prostate cancer invasion. Addition of exogenous sarcosine or knockdown of the enzyme that leads to sarcosine degradation, sarcosine dehydrogenase, induced an invasive phenotype in benign prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor and the ERG gene fusion product coordinately regulate components of the sarcosine pathway. Here, by profiling the metabolomic alterations of prostate cancer progression, we reveal sarcosine as a potentially important metabolic intermediary of cancer cell invasion and aggressivity."

175912566,"Hi everyone, I got the Invega shot last Thursday. That, in conjunction with taking a Resveratrol at night seems to be helping me gain insight into the origins of my delusions of grandeur. I won’t go into the details of the content of my delusions other than to say that I actually believed that I was all kinds of famous people and that the famous people in real life were impostors who had “stolen” my achievements. So delusions of persecution as well, I guess. Anyway, I take full responsibility for holding these irrational beliefs and behaving erratically (when I’m not medicated), but I think part of it is overcompensating for the fact that I was not valued or paid attention to by my parents.

With anything, if it’s something you love/dream about it, oh it’ll work itself out in the end as far as getting it done! For sure! I’ve been through a million majors and schools to only come back to my dream major: a philosophy degree. In which nearly everyone is saying “don’t do that degree. There’s no jobs for it”. Well I had to plan out a loose sense of what I need to do with the degree in order to counteract what people thought. I have a couple of plans. Both of which I think are easy to obtain in regards to doing what I dream of. One being formulating the degree to learn what I need to learn in order to become what I 
want, a writer. I been telling people I “believe” but, deep down I KNOW philosophy will help me write better in so many ways imaginable. Man... and my writing is philosophy based and infused. That’s my dream major. Deep down if i don’t go after that I will be so darn upset. I can see myself on my deathbed having the regret of not doing my dream major.

175912591,"I’m not going to pretend I have severe cognitive problems , but neither am I going to deny that I have any at all . It’s far easier for me to post on a forum like this than to cope with the practicalities of day to day living . I get a fair amount of support to maintain a reasonable, though not particularly high functioning, level of independence ."
175912592,I really feel like if you tried you could make some positive changes in your life. Spending all day in bed being catered to by your parents is no way to live. If I were you I’d start journaling some small goals and start checking them off.
175912593,"I was originally diagnosed with ADHD and depression. so I was on Adderall for 6 months before getting a schizophrenic diagnosis. my doctor took me off the amphetamine when I was admitted to the psych ward for two weeks and I went through the withdrawals there, I left and was feeling sad that I didn’t have my amphetamine. so I think I just kept bugging him about it until he said “ok fine” and he gave me Dexedrine 45mg. for the first few months it gave benefit. but then came psychosis over time. the motivation left. it’s been a process of being on and off of a stimulant of some kind for 4 years now. generally I go off and after a few weeks or months do better. but then I go off all meds eventually due to lack of insight, I go back on meds, can’t take the sedation (probably because they use to put me on the max dose of whatever AP) and so I beg them for a stimulant and things again go really well for a month or two, but then again the motivation leaves and is replaced by mild psychosis and a
pathy. I feel if my invega dosage is slowly lowered to 50mg or maybe this new 100mg will be good enough, then I won’t feel so sedated and in zombie mode, thus won’t need the stimulants. I think it’s finally time for me to quit the stimulants for good and stay insightful and stay on my meds at these lower doses."

175912596,I’d do the same thing. Switch jobs every two years. I think I’d just get sick of the daily routine. Once I learned how to do everything the job itself became shitty. That happened at a lot of places. Plus I quit because I was paranoid that I was getting fired.
175912597,"I'll never forget that woman in the psych ward. The one that said I'm too smart and should try meth to be like her and that it's ok to be stupid. Or the people that said they would see me again.. They didn't say in the next life.. Just that they'll see me again. I've seen things. Heard things. Things that would scare anyone. And now I walk.. What is following me? Everyone is like a puppet as Job said. What do I need? What do I need to know? It's like my mind is a snow globe that got shook and never settled. I'm not sure if it ever will. Many people are like that. I was always the withdrawn person. It's all too late to go back. What can I do now? The coronavirus, the economy worse than the great depression. People are losing it. My brothers bf went manic and right before he went on a plane to Paris to see Europe and hang himself there, the police got him and brought him to the hospital. It's nuts. People tell me not to lose it. But I'm always calm. I'm not a real person. I found out that my dad actu
ally is a jehovas witness. He's grounded. Many people are. Are they right for not letting nonsense go on? I'd say so. I feel like there's no point to anything. I've known that for the longest I can remember. Make a point.. make a point.. BOOM. Insight, everything good. Who's running the world? It's gotten worse and worse and people don't see. They're all just trying to be calm. I'm trying to tolerate it all. I'm tired and burned out. Everyone is."

175912605,I used to have a lot of issues with this… but that predated my illness.

I am not comfortable with this at all, dancing is one thing I hate it but I get it it's a job. This is a friendship and he is the customer that she sees the most.

175912635,"I've shared before but tonight I feel as I need to write out my frustrations. This is a coping tool I learned probably 15 yrs ago. Writing. Let's see; last Saturday, I believe, I had a miserable day full of pain. Sunday, I am pretty sure I still hurt. Then again, I'm not sure either. Stupid memory!! I absolutely hate that remembering things is so difficult for me. Not sure how my days went. Some good. Some awesome and some I just wanted to stay in bed, curl up and don't do anything. It sometimes feels like I can't/don't do or say anything right. Today had been a pretty good day. Got things accomplished. A pleasant day out with my fiance. After a visit with our friends we come back to where we are staying. At a different friend's house. So very frustrating!! Our room is tiny. There's room for a full size mattress and not much more. Of course we have clothes hung anywhere and everywhere. Hard for me to get the door open far enough to get in with my purse, a plastic bag with snacks from the gas statio
n and something else. We have to keep trying to move around each other and I kept bumping into something. We get our room organized as much as possible. My fiance takes the trash out. I go to the area where we store stuff to get a new trash bag. Can't find them. My fiance comes back in so I ask him if he knows where the bags are. I know we have plenty. A partial roll and a new one with about 4 bags used. Low and behold: can't find them. They grew legs and walked off. I am so so tired of coming back to our tiny room only to find something missing. Those trash bags cost me close to $7.00. Not cheap for something your just going to throw away. One time it was my phone charger and wall plug. One of our bowls. Food comes up missing out of the fridge. My friends adult son is the thief. We came back one day and he was just about to leave with my walker. See he had just gotten jumped the day before. Poor baby, probably messed with the wrong person. He-he-he!! There was an issue with it but in the end he didn't leave 
with my walker. He was going to sell it to supply his habits. Course he said he was just going to go for a walk. Tomorrow we are going to get a new door knob. One that locks. I can't wait!! Thanks for listening to me vent. Hope y'all have a good night. I think I am tired enough to lay down. It's 11:30 p.m. Sleep tight."

175912648,"You gotta make some changes, you gotta work on yourself. We can’t get religious here but we say in AA: “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.” I mean my guess is that you have a lot of time, why not make plans and a course of action to get a little something out of life? In my experience, most people have some kind of potential, you just got to find yours. If you are seeing a psychiatrist or therapist than take advantage of it. Tell them right now you’re stuck but you want their help to find something you are good at. Whatever you’re doing now ain’t working so come up with a new strategy. Set goals, either big or small. Once you accomplish them it will give you a little confidence. But like someone else said, it’s mainly up to you. There’s plenty of help out there but you have to do stuff to help yourself too. Good luck."

I also had chronic chest pain from something making it hard to work. There were also lots of people being really rude to me making me feel unhappy. I feel like I had a lot of stress going on when I first experienced schizophrenia. I took like 3 years for the chest pain to go away. I also had bad lasik eye surgery done which I had to pay for again at another place and have fixed. It made my reading vision worse making it hard to do my job. Now I don’t mind the lasik my reading vision is better. I will never do it again.

175912717,I believe she does. She reads notes from my therapist and I think I have told her. I’ve told her at least about the lsd because I had a complication with a medication that brought lsd flashbacks. I see her tomorrow so I will ask her opinion about it all

175912720,shoot its out of stock.
175912721,Maybe you still have feelings for her even if you didn’t want to be with her. You have no control over your dreams. There’s really no definitive answer about what dreams mean anyways. So you dreamed about her; you dream about a million other things too and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything.

It doesn’t mean literally live on your own. It just means make decisions for yourself. Humans are adaptable , even sz affected persons. You can learn to deal with and fix your impulsive nature and then you won’t gamble your money or be violent. It takes patient practice surely?"
175912757,"Hmmm well the issue is it takes most medications several weeks to begin to take effect. (And most meds you have to slowly move up to the therapeutic dose so that takes even longer) So if you tried just taking meds for stressful time periods, most likely the stressor would be over by the time the med kicked in. The only way I could see that working is if you knew the stressor was coming like 2 or 3 months ahead of time, then went on a med. But that is not always going to be possible. If you want to avoid flare ups you should really just be on an AP in general."

175912763,"I GET IT, I really do!! But there may be some psychiatric things that you dr has not offered. Genetic testing for psych drugs and your body’s ability to benefit from it. The test is called Genomind , my dr covered the cost for me. It was really interesting because it eliminated getting on and off of meds that were never going to help. It identified which meds would help the most —- and that my body was not able to convert regular folate into the form that it needed to cross the blood brain barrier. Before the test we spent years trying different meds that never really worked correctly. Now I am on Cymbalta and Deplin. The _PERSON_ lets the Cymbalta cross ito the brain! But _PERSON_ is not covered by insurance and is expensive. When I run out the depression increases so I buy it . Genetic test also identified adult onset ADD and when that was treated I was not nearly as overwhelmed. But even with the right 3 meds I still battled to get off of the sofa some days. I was also dealing with health is
sues and have 3 brilliant LD CHILDREN. MY DAUGHTER developed major depression and a residential treatment program. My psychiatrist suggested TMS . It is a daily treatment with a magnetic pulse on very specific places on your brain. It took a really long time before it worked but once it did it lifted the depression. It too is expensive and insurance doesn’t help enough....mental health benefits! But after two years of persistence on both our parts .....I could function and enjoy life. The other TMS benefit is that it is not a medication. N I Hope some of this offers you some help. Be persistent about not getting better and go online and look into non traditional ways to treat depression. Even supplements can help. There are other non medication treatments besides TMS. That might work too."

I also had a couple gangstalkers in there but those faded after they left me alone for awhile.

175912784,"I grew up in a religious household too. I think when we start experiencing symptoms the only thing that makes sense to us is that it’s demons or angels or god, Because of our religious background. It may feel like a comfort now, but manipulating your religion to fit your illness is dangerous. I felt the same way you do now, but those feelings turned on me as my symptoms got more aggressive and I began to think I was possessed. It was the worst possible way to cope. I ended up having to cut all religion out of my life in order to regain some control. I suggest you try to stop this line of thinking while your ahead. Its hard, not knowing if religious stuff is true or the afterlife, but its part of living."

First, focus on getting better- therapy, meds, yoga (this was just mentioned in a thread) or something similar, etc. Then worry about working. You can’t work if you aren’t healthy, so that has to come first. Finally, work your way up. Start part-time if you need to. Do you have family that will support you?

I couldn’t work or function or do much for the first 10 years. the first 5 were the worst. I actually felt the mental agony every day. I did lack insight for a while until I had a dream that I was told I had schizophrenia. It was like a light switch 5 years ago lol. I had tons of doctors tell me I had A) schizophrenia or B) schizo-affective disorder. It wasn’t an instant diagnosis but a diagnosis of exclusion. Part of me thinks aliens or the government gave me my ‘insanity’ but I really don’t know. I’m trying to move forward. In the end, it doesn’t matter how you got schizophrenia (because I tried convincing people for 10 years my thoughts and experiences were real) and it just never registers to people…"
175912800,Hahahahaha that made me laugh
175912801,[ If scared won’t be able to do good on neuropsych testing and say I can concentrate and do well or get denied if don’t get testing can get Dr to say in note debating between schzioaffective and depression with psychosis and that can tell severity of condition without me having neuropsych testing and recommend that I don’t work would that help me get social security

175912804,same here… there was something going on at least one time every day.
175912805,Well your answer is wrong in a couple ways no matter how sure you are of yourself. I did not start it. She did. I wasn’t “ogling.” You say that with no idea if it’s true or not. I wasn’t staring but I did look and not for a long time. I find it almost ridiculous that looking at a woman who wants to be looked at is somehow wrong. As to the weight lifting. She was rather petite and I said what I said because they were heavy weights and I was surprised she could lift so much.
175912806,"Just a thought - a suggestion - but have you seen the mental health app _PERSON_? It has a thing where you can check in, do various exercises like mindfulness & meditations for specific mental health things like anxiety, has guided paths where you can learn more about how to deal with moods and stuff, and other things. Maybe it'd help you? I have been using it now for a few months. It does cost money to get the paid features, but I only pay for the lowest level of features (I think it's like $8.99 a month last I checked). It also has inspiring quotes. Anyway, just something I thought of that could help you."

175912814,"After every half time, the quantity will be reduced by 50% of the previous value, not by 50% of the initial value. Within 24 hours the quantity will be reduced to half 2 times, because 24 hours = 2x the half time. So at t=0 hours quantity is 100%; at t=12 hours quantity is 100/2 = 50%; at t=24 hours quantity is 50/2 = 25%. Every time you take another med, you add that to the current quantity. So if you take 100% dose after 24 hours has passed since your last dose, it will be 25% (the current %) + 100% = 125% of the medication is left. Now if you wait another half life (now t=36h) the quantity will be reduced half again: 125/2 = 62.5%. Instead of % you can put milligrams, so if you took 100mg at t=0h and 100mg at t=24h, the quantity of the medication in your system at t=24h is the same as if you just took 125mg of it for the first time ever."

When he doesn’t understand something right away, he gets easily upset and ends up fighting with me endlessly about it. And then I have to be in the position of being the mean guy who makes him do his homework, while Mr. Star gets to come home and just play video games and do activities. That’s not a dig at Mr. Star, by the way. He’s a great dad. But I want to be the fun parent, too! I feel like 90% of my time is spent just keeping Starlet on track, and only 10% is spent doing fun bonding activities.

175912833,Go somewhere in public with my shirt off. It used to be my greatest fear maybe. Taking my shirt off in public. As a guy they subliminally tell you there’s nothing to be ashamed of But I developed extreme workout regiments and mild eating disorder to cope with this all at the end of high school. Still never felt comfortable with no shirt on. But now I look in the mirror and I say “men must retain muscle from the past working out”. Because I do!! And I heard this in the past. But I’ve never looked so good with no shirt on for some reason. Maybe my perception is different of myself. I’m down a few pounds from cutting out sugar. But only like 4 pounds I’m down. But I’m looking damn healthy. Sorry no pics. I quit working out much years ago. But it looks like I must work out a little. I do walk like 7 miles per day. Does that help your abs and stuff??

If you stop the depakote at the same time as you make significant diet modifications, you may never know whether it was your diet or the depakote that caused the liver issues. Since there is only an upside to improving your diet and losing weight, I would try that first. Since there could be a significant downside to stopping the depakote, I would recommend keeping that option to try if the the diet/weight loss don’t work."

175912879,"I have used Klonopin for 15 years without addiction, I also get my prescript ion through a Psychiatrist. My understanding is any of the Benzos have the potential for addiction that's why Benzos are a controlled substance and has been the case in all of the years I have used Klonopin. I believe Klonopin is preferred in treating anxiety because it is a longer acting Benzo than Xanax. I don't know but I suspect Xanax would have more of a potential of addiction simply because it is short acting so the need for more becomes higher (depending on he level of anxiety). Regardless, the use of Benzos need to be used with caution due to the possibility of addiction. I believe the possibility of addiction depends on the individual person. In my case, I saw, at a young age, what addiction to prescript ion drugs can do to a person and I have no desire to go down that path. Klonopin works best for me simply because it also helps with Spasticity (muscle tightness/spasms) and doesn't make me as tired as muscle rela
xers, although I can and do use both at the same time (sometimes). My Psychiatrist is aware I use Klonopin for anxiety and Spasticity and is fine with that."

174331759,"It's really weird because I tend to be much more emotionally expressive after my psychedelic trips yet I still struggle with motivation - Even with doing the things that I like. My mom makes me do 3 things every day (Wash the dishes, clean the cat litter box and take out the garbage). I wake up knowing that I have to do those things. It's hard and I hate doing them and sometimes procrastinate but mostly I do it. I wake up, chew nicotine gum, make coffee (To wake me up a little) and then do hygiene - Brush my teeth, etc.. After the previous Invega injection, I managed to vacuum and organize my closet because I was calmer. I often vacuum my room and organize it. I was raised by a narcissist that would keep me busy all day every day and now I think to myself - I never had any time for myself.. To build an identity.. I was always doing chores.. Constant chores - Day in and day out.. Nothing else except going to school (Avoidant from potential friends) and working as a mechanic and welder (They didn't l
et me learn because I was too young - So I was doing meaningless chores there as well) - I had enough. I broke down and went psychotic from stress.. I suppose you need a life or you won't be stable at any job. I'm getting much better over the years though. I've had severe negative symptoms since I was ~12 years old."

175912891,I don’t like these kinds of statements because they create a kind of division/split… It’s also a form of snobbery against … ‘snobs’. At least ‘perceived’ snobs. Who’s to say a person can’t have all those things AND be kind? There’s no reason to divide these up.

175912917,Seroquel is for example used for insomnia. I guess if the ap helps you sleep theres nothing Wrong with that. Compared to hypnotics and Melatonin they are more powerful. Seroquel Knocks me out but im allergic to that.
175912918,Now I'm pretty sure I don't want to take olanzapine because of the side effects. I had really bad side effects last time. That's why my pdoc wants me off of it. He definitely wants me to stop taking it. I guess I'm just wondering why I do this back and forth stuff all the time. Maybe it's part of my personality.
174331764,And also the effectiveness of medication and therapy

175912944,Unfortunately benzo withdrawal can last for a long time. It’s called protracted withdrawal. I had been on ativan for a lot longer than 6 months though. This was back when they basically gave out benzos like candy. I had an unlimited supply. I was drinking heavily at the time and that made things worse. That’s the reason my doc at the time sent me to a detox center. I wouldn’t have been able to stop on my own.
175912945,"I took Amisulpride once, which is an atypical antipsychotic. I preferred being on Haloperidol, in fact I would probably prefer to be on Haldol at the moment. The only problem with Haldol is that it’s very difficult to come off, as I found on one occasion. Long-term I don’t think most people on this forum should be relying solely on medication, of course we have to take it but it should be at a manageable level. I want to get mine reduced so I am capable of living a more normal life. The idea of being on these medications for life, scares me."

I don't know of it's all My mental issues my health issues or both.Doctors as you probably know or r very lucky don't have any answers except drugs I don't want. I really am feeling like a freak. That's really why I am here to see if anyone else has this problem. The one thing that does work but it is hard to do at 5am evet6 morning is get up out of bed .It is a lot less.I read that it worked and does .I miss lieing in bed in the morning I'm peace until I want to get up not have to.

175912976,"Yes, I felt like it was worn off but then I remembered how I felt on tiz which I love, and I kind of feel like that on kratom. He gave me a variety for pain. I'll worry about tolerance after I get some capsules next time. I'm already panicking at the thought of being without the disposable vape pods. Craving it all day today. I hope I can control myself and not use it before bed time."
175912977,"Thank you. The politics and some employees make the work environment unbearable for me. But it’s not so much the employees as it is the politics and culture of being in an office setting, in general. And management is not the best. On Glassdoor and indeed, last employee’s have rated the job like a 1.3 out of 5 stars. I think I would really like to go back to my idea of working from home. Unfortunately I can’t find a job that will take me with my little experience and no degree. And I have yet to hear from the University I applied to, and I’m not sure if I can afford a second certification for something. So I’m in a bind so much. I don’t think I’m acclimating well to this job. It’s been 8 months now, going into March, and I’m still not doing well. I don’t think I was cut out for something like this. Not the position, but the office setting and the politics behind it all."

175912992,"I think they hear voices as objects instead of unreal ppl like most schizophrenics. When I am unmedicated I become somewhat like them, I caress walls thinking they’re a person or a dog.

Everyone is different, some people like hard physical labour and minimal interactions, others like lots of interactions but no physical stuff. I don’t like interactions that are too personal, like feeding or helping patients use the toilet or clean themselves. It’s too much responsibility. But I don’t mind answering a few calls from elderly people needing me to help fix their antivirus settings. I don’t like physical labour, so a desk job where I can do things at my own pace is actually great for me"
175913001,"Thats exactly my opinion. Its a temporary solution. Once you want to go back to regular eating it undoes itself. My weight is really bothering me at the moment. I’m 6’2 and about 18 stone. Before psychosis I was around 12 stone (same height). Every year I put on about half a stone or something. To put it another 1 third of my body weight is unneeded.

I’m not suicidal, I just have a really strong passive death wish. Suicide isnt an option for me unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I havent decided how I feel about that."
175913009,A lot of people who have taken a lot of OxyContin end up liking it a lot. Maybe too much. The fact that she makes it last 3/4 weeks she’s doing better than a lot of other people with managing her pills. Still be VERY CAUTIOUS and weary. I dunno it’s really tough you don’t wanna tell her doctor just yet she’s abusing them then they’ll take away her script and then she can only go to the street to get pain pills or powders (bad). Maybe I’ll have better advice later.

174331788,"I can relate, I used to be a social worker. I was actually in University studying Sociology on the onset of my first psychosis. Due to my mental health I can’t work in my chosen profession, I owe student loans and feel like I’ve wasted so many years of my life. I think people with schizophrenia can have stressful jobs, but if I am being realistic, I don’t think people like me should work with the marginalized(people who are vulnerable) . There are many careers that I can pursue, agriculture, tourism, playwright, commercial artist, the list goes on. Where I live, there are employment courses you can take that helps you figure out a career. If you are really set on reentering the workforce I suggest you try exploring this avenue or find an employment counselor that can help you with it. Good Luck"
175913021,I didn’t believe my psychology courses at first but I did after finding many research articles proving them right like the article I posted above.

175913027,"I recently came out of a really low depressive episode and have been trying to keep my head above water ever since. Unfortunately, it didn’t work and my mood recently slipped back down. I was trying to think about how to explain how that really feels, the process of trying to keep depression at bay. Keeping my head above water On a day to day basis when I’m stable or close to stable, I feel as though I’m swimming along through water with one manageable weight on my back which is my bipolar disorder. It’s hard to keep swimming but I can manage, I keep my head above the water although sometimes it’s higher than other times, sometimes my chin touches the water, sometimes the waves are choppier, but in general I keep moving forward and I’m coping. Occasionally there are islands along the way and I get to stop for a rest, and there are some really beautiful things on the island; I experience true happiness at these times and I am able to fully relax, then I start swimming again. Sinking lowe
r When my mood is sinking lower and I am struggling to stay afloat, it feels as though more weights are being added to my back as I swim. I try to keep going but it gets harder and harder to keep my head up and to keep moving forward towards the next island. I do my best to knock the weights off, to get back on an even keel, and sometimes I manage. Other times, more and more weights keep being added and before long I’m just treading water, not moving forward, stuck in one place just trying not to drown. By the time it gets to this point I am very unlikely to be able to remove the weights and to get moving again; I start to feel at a loss and helpless, worried about slipping under the water into full depression and feeling worthless because I haven’t been able to keep swimming even though I’ve tried really hard. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-journey/2019/08/trying-not-to-drown-how-fighting-off-depression-feels/"

Everyone has issues with sleep deprivation but our symptoms tend to get worse when tired. Example: typically I can handle work and home life. When I’m tired the people in my head talk more and handling gets harder. You may not realize yet what’s distracting your thinking. I believe you’re as smart as you ever were. Symptoms are just making it harder in you."

But the stimulus will cover most of that and I will get back on track next month. I should be out of debt by the end of the year, round about."

174331786,I was first diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder in early high school. ADD when I was 7. Then when I was 21 it was very wierd I hadn’t worked in a year or so and my family wanted me to go on disability so they talked to my psychiatrist and he told me I had a much better chance of getting it if he changed my diagnosis. So he diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder even though I hadn’t had any symptoms. Then the symptoms came later! In my mid 20’s I was diagnosed with PTSD from experiences in my early teens that only came back to me then.

174331780,"well i think it was an overload of stress that caused. it was when i tried to hike to california. i had walked over 200 miles into southern illinois before i was brought into jail. i had hiked 200 miles on only 2 jars of peanut butter and a potato salad from walmart. anyways when i got to jail, my charge was failure to identify officially, but those were dropped. anyways when i got to jail, i refused to eat, thinking i would go on a spiritual fast and wait for my release and justice to be done. well what ended up happening was they held me longer than i thought, and the judge was a conservative prick who didn’t think i was within my rights. so my little fast turned into 13 long days and nights of not eating nothing. i was already diagnosed with schizophrenia, about a year prior, i was given meds, but they caused side effects and i thought i didn’t need them. i had a drug induced hallucination at age 20 but it ended when i came down and i never hallucinated again until this time in illinois at g
e 26 or 27. so anyway it started with me hearing my brother’s voice, he kept telling me that mom and dad had died, and other things, i entertained these thoughts but didn’t believe my brother, i started to think of him as rather sinister, i felt like they were testing me. then after that i started to see cartoon characters on all the walls in my cell dancing around playing instruments. i was in a padded cell and ill add i was completely naked, i had taking off my clothes like king _NAME_ in the bible, proclaiming only god can judge me or something. then i started to hear voices from all kinds of people childhood friends, family other than my brother, still my brother, and my doctor who had diagnosed me, she was the worst her words tormented me. actually the whole thing tormented me, it was like i was a lab rat being experimented on by higher beings. so this went on for a few days, my wild vivid hallucinations, and one day i started to see the jailer as an evil creature, like a cannibalistic monster who wa
s part bird part man, for some reason he wasn’t interested in eating me, but changed back into human form when going past my cell. i thought there was this big whole struggle inside the jail and i was so important not to be affected by it. then after they took me out of the padded cell, i finally relented, and ate a bag of corn chips. i felt a little better, but i didn’t want to touch any of the meat they were serving as i was vegetarian at the time. so eventually i called home to mom and dad, and by doing so was identified, mom and dad drove to illinois and picked me up from jail, and i never heard another word about the failure to identify charges. ???? went from normal, to crazy auditory and visual hallucinations in about a week, probably triggered from the stress of not sleeping much, fasting, and too much physical activity. like hiking 200 miles. and then the voices were with me from then on even with meds in some form or another."

I also once wrote a short story I thought was really unique, but did what I always do with such things. That is, I left it for a few days and came back to it before publishing.

So if you consider this its easyer to let it go, P.S like the phrase, here is a link to some good tunes 9 ??????? 2020 ?. - YouTube"

175913086,Health and eating healthy etc that was posted recently? We weren’t supposed to say actual weight but rather focus on what we’re doing to be healthy.
174331797,"I’m finding myself bitter about periods of time when I had depression, and I think significant periods of time to understand that I was severely depressed, from someone whom studied medicine, dealt with it herself, and I feel very sour about it. From lack of help with homework, and my failures as a student and the stress and anxiety I went through and the depression, I just feel very little actual justice in how poorly my parents provided for me…and my outcome as a schizophrenic, and how they’ve made me feel now that I’m not working, now that I’m not “normal”… I still care deeply about them, despite their flaws, and I’m relying on them now more then ever, and its not getting me anything. Even if its true, and there isn’t any smelling of ones own farts going on… I just feel like the world needs to know I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t steal from people, I didn’t bully kids, I was just a person having a hard time, and there is no justice in this. This is a senseless un
caring illness, that preys on poor people, and I feel like so much of the world is blaming me for not being some sort of beast mode alpha male and powering through tons of symptoms, that I’m an abject failure and leech on society. There shouldn’t be a ditch where we just throw all our expectations for a person’s quality as a human being just because they got sick from something, but here we are, schizophrenic, and the world think’s we’re scum junkies that’ve never been worth a damn and that we deserve everything that’s happened to us. I’ve never done a drug in my life, but I still got the Schizophrenia, I never had a record. I was a model citizen, but now that I have this illness, now that I’m on disability, the world thinks I’m garbage. People I’ve grown up with, have shown their true colors and people I thought of as close family have sorely disappointed me with their insults, their abrupt disassociation, their lack of patience. People I’ve given so much effort to, despite other peop
le deserving it more, and for what? For me to be tossed aside because I upset them with my lack of energy."

175913089,"So, I’ve been taking this @ bedtime for a month, bedtime being somewhere between midnight and sunrise (7-9am).

And I noticed some twitching, he said watch it for a week and I reported a little more. It is quetiapine, I can cope w/out quetiapine if I have a persisting twitching condition, such as tardive dyskinesia. I will have to discuss it with the doctor. It is small twitching like a sneer upside down on either side of my nose. Those muscles are slightly tense and ready to clench."
175913090,Unfortunately I feel mental illness sort of forces one to be self centered…so much going on in your brain it can be difficult to pay attention to what’s going on around you…and it also requires a lot of focusing on yourself to work on it. But I don’t see anything wrong with being self centered if you are using that to improve yourself and quality of life. Sometimes I feel it is necessary to be self centered for our own wellbeing.
174331806,Yes lione’s mane work. Its good for reducing anxiety. But don’t take big dose daily as some people reported increasing positive symptoms when take it for long and at higher doses. Phosphatidylserine also gives similar effect. Both good for memory too.
175913091,"My mother told my priest I have sz, he said go see a psychiatrist. My friend was suicidal with depression, priest sent him to his friend, a psychiatrist."

175913100,Yes… That’s correct.
174331805,It’s a spectrum I think Schizoid …> schizotypal …> schizophrenia. The first two are personality types.
174331804,"I don’t see my psychiatrist as the enemy, I respect him and he does the best for me. The problem is the system. In the future there will be a lot more successful people who have suffered from schizophrenia [I deliberately avoid the term ‘schizophrenic’] because of the sheer increase in mental health issues and now acceptance in society to belong to such a group of people. I do not let the diagnosis get me down, I have suffered for the past 12 years so I know it’s not a fluke, yet determined to make a success of myself. I want to work in IT Support or to do some programming. I have my injection [my medication] tomorrow morning. I have been on medication for the worst part of 12 years!"
175913101,"True, _AT_MENTION_. What worries me is the dissociation part of it all-- when the paranoia starts and if it’s really bad, I’ll dissociate. Hasn’t gotten to that level yet, and I’m hoping I’ll be so much “in the zone” at work that I won’t have time for the thoughts to creep in. Gotta stay grounded somehow!"

175913108,I feel better with a male psychiatrist. I can’t talk about sexual problems with a female psychiatrist.
175913109,Just ignore that. My mental health be ok rn
174331807,"Sounds like schizophrenia. I thought you were doing better? I had similar symptoms early on and it mostly went away. Mine was DP/DR and I felt like nothing existed including my mind and the outside world. I sort of believe we live in a SIMs, but then I want to reject it because I hate the idea. We COULD be wrong. I mean it could just be isomorphic to a video game, but then again most people would say no. I had “delusions” or was made to think I escaped the simulation several times and even helped run it as a programmer, but then I am stuck in this life or reality for semi-eternity as a schizophrenic. I don’t want it and don’t like it and wish I could take it all away."

175913114,"No I didn’t double my dose, I only took it that day. I think Xanax is not working for the intrusive thoughts but it’s making me sleepy. The only reason my health got so bad is I’m no longer exercising, the gym was a huge help. I was exercising like 2hours day, it was helping my intrusive thoughts. I’m thinking of buying a machine for my house, I don’t have space to put it. I’m so overwhelmed by these thoughts, they consumed my life."
175913115,"I’m not capable of working, not even on meds. My current psychiatrist agrees."
175913116,"me, 2! Hugs!!"
175913117,Sorry it gave you so many side effects. I don’t have voices so I don’t think I will need such a high dose but we will see I guess if it works for me or not. I just get so nervous about changing meds. i really don’t want another hospital trip.

175913120,"Well, it was always easier for me, when its up to write I am not like this in irl. I sometimes have my fears here, but its less than in real life, yeap. Maybe I have some cognitive deficits too. Maybe my brain is not working properly and I have my fears yeap… Otherwise, I am not strong in personality. For example, I even don’t know which food I like, which music, which people… If I have my ‘‘like’’ moments, this is the euphoria which talks… I know, that it happens to lose the personality in sz, but it happens in other mi too… I also lack positive emotions, I often cant even love, which is a pain, cause only a loving person can be in a good health . Thanks for the support Ocean- spray Do you believe, that if meds don’t help enough, I should try efforts now? I keep the lowest possible dose I think though. Tbh I also ask myself now, if the meds didn’t cause me more panic and anxiety. Its possible, they lower the dopamine, the hormone of the happiness. But I am afraid to stop them

175913138,"Same, bb. I also need to write but cant seem to do it. I told myself I would write on weekends cuz I have more time to, and I'm not. I think it's the fact that the amount I need to write is overwhelming and I just dont want to do it. A whole book basically. So i guess I'm procrastinating. I need to do more research cuz idk, I'm not going to be able to do 300 or 200 or whatever pages I need for a book. I dont even know where to start!"

175913141,"Hi, After many years of recovery from Lyme disease, I've lost most of my friends. This happened in the slow drifting away of friends who didn't want to see my misery (or didn’t know how), and in my drifting too, in the feeling that I had become unlikeable in my illness, no fun at all. I didn't want to further turn off people, so I stopped reaching out. I hoped that by the time I got well, I would pick up where I left off. But it changed me. I have lost faith that I could be likable at all, or that anyone might actually stick around. This has kept me from embracing the few people who extend the hand of friendship, it’s kept me from reaching out to old friends, or from even responding to their calls. I always want to, I plan on it, but I don’t. How do you find trust again? Thanks and be well!"

But I’m still not sure if the world inside my head is real or not? My brain rationalizes every little thing that my hallucinations do and it’s very stressful even when they aren’t around because I feel like I’m ignoring real people. Does anyone else feel this way?"

174331819,I really like my current psychiatrist. The last one was over the phone because of the lockdown and tele-medicine access. He was very supportive and thoughtful. He actually cares about my personal life and seems to genuinely want to help. He orders bloodwork and tests when I start a new medication or around twice a year. The sessions aren’t very long over the phone. It’s hard to find a person who genuinely cares about your health and does this job to help people. He originally thought I had Bipolar and not Schizophrenia. He may still think this.

175913163,But i think ethically its totally messed up cuz your looked at as nothing more than a liability. But if your symptoms dont get in the way then ethically you should be able to practice only if your sound enough to know when to take a leave of absence if and when they return

175913176,"Good news: Liquid IV energy supplement is working and I plan on reducing the amount of monsters I drink by half starting today. It’s still costly but not cost prohibitive and won’t bankrupt me, make me sick, and I might improve 10-20% (optimistically) just by stopping crappy monster drinks (doesn’t matter the brand really). I’m starting to think “schizophrenia” is 50% being a Monster addict. I don’t know why I let some sugary drink control my life and destroy me and ruin me like this. It’s like crack in a way. It’s really pathetic. For the past 2 years, I’ve been drinking 10 monster energy drinks every day. 4 in the morning, 4 in the afternoon, and 2 at night. I had to go from 4.5 mg of Vraylar to 6 mg and then finally to 9 mg and then even added an extra 20mg of Latuda. I’m so tired of it I think the drinks are going to literally kill me or make me permanently a vegetable or permanently psychotic. It’s probably is the reason I never recovered to begin with. I don’t know w
hy I like them. It’s like I ended up autistic or something…with primitive emotions and behaviors. The bad news: I’m worried I’ll be harassed or messed with or ruined if I go back to college like I’ll be a TI or get triggered or gang-stalked like at the local private mental hospital in my area. I don’t know. I know this website is basically a joke for privacy and it wasn’t mean to be anonymous or private at all. Anyone thinking otherwise is an idiot. I just want to get that degree and not be messed with. Basically, I got abducted by aliens and was messed with OR just in Monarch program at college back in early to mid 2011. I keep resurrecting back in time in a time loop/causal loop. I cannot remember much because it’s like I’m in a permanent time slip like at a different time like from a parallel universe/future back in time TO THE YEAR 2013. I have little to no memory of life and college anymore and they ruined my life. I got no compensation or apology and I thought my life could be in dange
r. I have other theories too like I went to outer space or some ???? like SSP and or was a Montauk boy. Something happened to my soul/consciousness and I haven’t ruled out I died and was cloned. That and we live in a simulation that is a billion to one away from my original life/reality. Like iterations or loops. It’s sort of like MWT of QM except it never ends and we live in a simulation on repeat with slight variations in reality for me. Finally, I never figured out who it was or if it was a group of people. I honestly worry about my safety and life all the time and fear of reprisal. Honestly, I won’t be going back to that school ever and most likely have to leave the state or go online or avoid all public institutions especially research ones. I’m pretty much screwed. I blame them for giving me schizophrenia, honestly. Since I’m in a time loop, it’s every life."

175913179,The thing about security is that there is almost no interaction with people at all overnight on a graveyard. Work waking hours and you’ll get stuck in a mall or other high traffic area that will be very triggering. That’s the trade-off.

175913184,"Yes she is like my wife, but I would like to have some help, for example for sleep."
175913185,"Hi _PERSON_, Thanks for starting the weekly check in thread. It has been cold and wet here for days now. But the colors are nice right now so that helps. Things have been going as well as can be expected I guess. Despite the weather. I hope you all have had a nice week and a good week to come. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175913186,I would give you some of my diazepam if I could Do you have any PRN?
175913187,"You are talented, Erti!!! Precious!!!!"
175913188,Cool thanks ! What meds are you on ?
175913189,no they never called me about it. It’s like i say i even doubt they even keep an eye on it as long as nobody puts in a complaint.
174331825,"I kind of strove to escape from myself, or from ""others"" most of today. I yearn so much for quietness & privacy within my mind."

175913191,You have good intentions and you have repented.
175913192,A new study shows the positive effects of LSD in white collar environments.
175913193,That’s one of the ones I’ve tried and the one I’m most likely to try again. I remember it being decent overall.
175913194,Thanks for the tips! I’m not in the USA or UK though.
175913195,These sound a lot like negative automatic thoughts....have you ever had cbt? It can help with stuff like that. You learn to rephrase the negative thought into something more realistic like...sometimes I am lazy but most of the time I’m doing the best I can. I deserve good things like everyone else. I should live...etc. eventually you just start thinking that way instead of the negative thoughts or at least 90% anyway. I tend to think hey I’m doing ok but I could do better instead of I suck ya know. Some of the intensity is lost when you stop automatically believing there is truth to the voices....they lie and that’s a fact.
175913196,? get paranoid about harming me in some ways.luckly i don t meet not much anyone who is don t like me.they are usually neutral to me
175913197,All night there were shadows flying around everywhere. Less now. I was quite scared sometimes but mostly just accepting. I’m not sure if it was my ghost or not.
175913198,Yeah they’ll come back. They always do.
175913199,Same here. Laundry takes forever but it has to be done.
175913200,Doesn't make sense. But that's how things work in my family too. The people that are the closest aren't always the ones that do the helping out. HUGS kit
175913201,Work tonight Prep for tomorrow’s lessons Relax

175913203,I’ve done about every awful thing in the book besides murdering somebody or rape
175913204,"I remember that day when you were pissed at me years ago and said, “no wonder people call you a sociopath.” I didn’t hate you at all, truth be told I thought it was a humorous (and astute) observation. I’m not a judgmental person either. Though, like yourself I’m not a fan of small talk. I can do it but I find it all insufferably drab and terribly ordinary."
175913205,buy gift cards for brother in law and nephew visit my dad buy a few groceries …and of course play with my cat
175913206,"These are tough times for people sick with stuff other than the covid. But a distant aunt of mine has just undergone lung surgery for cancer. In Germany, that is. I guess they accept people based on the gravity of their ailment."
175913207,I feel like I can’t think. Like I’m trying to think but I can’t. I don’t know if it’s because my AP was increased a little over a week ago. I just feel weird.
174331831,Would starting a war with Freemason's lead to hearing 'voices' ?
175913208,What I can still do is listening to music which I do all day everyday.
175913209,Bit of work stress. Started using a (new to me) program called Microsoft Teams. Still trying to work that out.
175913210,I’m still not going back on Depakote. ???? these meds. All they do is make me fat and mess with my functioning. I am so sick and tired!
175913211,Showered and shaved. I shower pretty much everyday but I shave my head every few days.
175913212,Good move. I understand how it feels to need that safety net…I hung onto my diazepam for months after I wasn’t taking it anymore but I eventually threw it away and it felt scary but I’ve never needed it. You should be proud of yourself.
175913213,"The Last Roll Call reached 100 pages. Time for a new one. Post, comment, thank, hug, talk, ponder, express, reply, muse."

175913216,"I find cooking hard as well but every time my mom cooks, I ask her to show me how and I put it on Evernote, write the recipe and take pictures. It's just another thing I'm trying to do to improve neuroplasticity and habits."
175913217,I feel like my camera phone is always on and TV is watching me through the screen. I mean I don’t really care but it still hinders me a bit in life. It causes little to no distress. It did in the beginning.
175913218,"“So, thats how to WOK your dog…”"
175913219,"Oh yeah, god luck with that. I am always chasing my former self, which doesn’t exist except in my head. Don’t worry about looks, as long as you know who you are, that’s worth so much more. But I can relate to that, I’m always wishing to be my former self. I’m meditating again tonight, hoping to find who I am. Good luck with your job hunt, it’s good to have something to do. Do you like reading? There are alot of good characters to look up to in books…"
175913220,"I totally hated haldol before. I had real real bad responses on regular doses. It is my prefered med now though. Mainly because the others i tried were even worse. But also, i can take a baby dose with little side effects. When i get a flare up of delusions i can take more for a few days and it works immediately and strongly. I know what it does, so i can play with it. It is really strong - just 2mg and i sleep like a baby all day. Which is good when you want to acutely stop fear, less good if you want to have a life."
174331840,"No. I just have been feeling like I can’t do anything like everything is a chore no motivation struggle every day for years worse. When I got sick, the n dibiltating when in hospital. Always pushing self to do smallest things. Worse this morning. I feel worse harder to do things for the past 3 or 4 days really bad… Then this morning I couldn’t do anything I starting screaming uncontrollably now I feel dazed it’s hard to do anything. This is like when I was in hospital before. I just sat for hours couldn’t get up. Then latest in bed. Up now. Don’t know how I will function for my family now that I’m home. I think I’m getting early dementia or something. My pdoc says no and is ordering ct scan for me. I do not want to go into the hospital again. I cant I take : Abilify 15, lamotrigine, risperadil, lithium, Vyvanse, modafinil. No changes in meds.

175913222,"Thanks for your reply, _AT_MENTION_! Your SAT score is impressive-- totally wish I was a good test taker, but alas, I’m not I’ll definitely echo what you’ve said about how the test is designed to see how well you take the test itself, rather than measure actual knowledge… I’ve heard you have to think extremely logically when answering questions, as the test will try to trick you. I’m unsure if I’ll ask for accommodations, but it’s good to know they exist just in case."

175913234,If you don’t take work off a lot then it’s fine to take a mental health day
175913235,"I just finished emptying the dish washer, my last chore for the day. It’s 10:30 pm here so I’m headed for bed. The day went pretty well so I am happy. Better than this morning. I woke up awfully suicidal - good timing because I had a phone appointment with my clinician at 11 am. We did some good work on my problems. Anyway, good night all."
175913236,I forgot on Sunday evening. My pdoc says missing one or two a month is not worth getting stressed over. Most of the time it doesn’t even make any difference other than sleep patterns might be interrupted.
175913237,My ex-husband used to go to all my pdoc and therapy appointments with me. I couldn’t breathe.
175913238,What's up desoxyn?
175913239,"Thanks,I don’t know about building tolerance?Do you need more after time?"
175913240,It’s not a method. I just dont get hungry anymore
175913241,"Self acceptance is key. It might not cure a disorder, but you will feel better."
175913242,"I went to the hospital so they could scan my kidneys for possible problems. I layed on a table and the orderly put a cushion under my legs for comfort and a couple warm blankets covering me. Then the technician running the whole show came in to operate the machine that was going to scan me. She looked to be about 24 or 25 and she was cute. She walked in to talk to me and she was bubbly, and giggling and friendly. Like some high school girl who has a masters degree or something. I was friendly back and she turned to talk to the orderly and she said something to him that wasn’t very smart; I would have thought it was lame if I was back in high school but she was nice and as an adult I cut people slack, I don’t have to be jerk and expect everybody to be perfectly cool. But what was funny was that I was thinking to myself, is there really people like her who are so friendly and open and kind of innocent, and are so happy that they don’t care how they sound? And the answer is yes, I could tell it 
wasn’t an act and that it was genuine and I felt bad that I had my doubts. So I joked around with her and she knew her business and the scan went off without a hitch. Then I left and got something to eat and drove to my next doctor appointment."
174331841,"I take supplements that chill me out. Otherwise I’d be sick with worry. I take them to combat abilify anxiety , but decreasing my worry seems to be a welcome “side effect” Here’s my daily cocktail L-theanine (750mg in divided doses) Beta Alanine 750mg Broccoli sprout extract Taurine 500mg"
175913243,Yes I will continue using them
175913244,Not to trigger you but _PERSON_ talks about this. That there are so many fake accounts online that can influence us and the news that it might be AI or something. At least that’s what I thought when he talked about it in a youtube video. The super-intelligence.
175913245,Could it be or am I in _NAME_ land? With a stranger? Maybe I really am drifting away with my delusions.
175913246,I wrote this down on a piece of paper when I was psychotic… Bad art can make you laugh Good art can make you think Great art can destroy you But I guess it’s what occurs after the destruction that matters the most.
175913247,"Since I increased dosage to 80 am 80 pm I have lesser intrusive thoughts. But since I stopped Wellbutrin, I’m feeling so tired. I’m also not taking Xanax so I have some withdrawal symptoms. I can’t wait to get better. I have good feelings about this."
175913248,"I don’t have to spend most of the day fighting to keep my sanity like I did before I was medicated. The first year I was diagnosed I went without medication and it was hell. I was 19 years old and should have been working and going to school and taking my girlfriend to the movies. Instead I was in a group home with people who were mostly worse off than me (though it’s hard to believe) and I was almost not functioning. No job, no school, no girlfriend. After I got asked to leave that place I survived a couple weeks before ending up back on a psyche ward. Then came the long term hospital. I was put on meds steadily for the first time. Spent 8 months there. I don’t think the meds made me better but I figure they stopped me from getting worse. I pretty much suffered the entire 8 months. Then my parents found a beautiful group home for me. Basically it was for rich kids. I hold the distinction of being the very last person they accepted who was on SSDI. I played about $400 a month rent while all t
he father’s of these sons and daughters who were doctors and professors and rich business people were paying over $2000 a month to have their kids there. Anyways, slowly I made progress and became stable. The medication kind of leveled out my lows and terrible symptoms and I started functioning again. I eventually got a job and eventually enrolled at a community college. But it was the meds that kept me out of the hospitals. I’m not going to argue with (relative) success. I tried going off meds a couple times early on and was flirting with disaster but luckily I got back on them. I’ll take them for life and be thankful that they were discovered."
175913249,"I hear what you are saying but the fact you are shy or quiet does not make you selfish or self centred, i wasnt saying that at all, i’m talking about the art of conversation, the social rules and wat is and isnt appropriate when talking to someone"

175913251,For like 1 year I put in my head that I would live off of ssi all my life and food stamps but recently I got a job I don’t know if I got sz or sza or bipolar since I did see things and hear voices etc.this is a big deal for me I’ve been working for over a week now it’s an easy job but takes physical strength. I’m surrounded by a lot of people daily so it forces me to interact with people and get out of my comfort zone but I don’t have to do much talking if I don’t want to witch is perfect. I worked 12 hour days for 5 days last week and was wondering when I would have to report my income to ebt.
175913252,Yeah I used to think that and yes at a certain point you are paying for prestige. It impresses other musicians. It’s like owning a first edition book. I also don’t need it because I already have a guitar. But. Look at it it’s so pretty!!! Plus it’s seven string. The gear doesn’t make the musician the musician makes the gear but successful musicians can’t all be wrong by investing in quality.

175913255,"I have been experiencing the exact same thing. I started taking 10mg Lexapro almost 3 weeks ago and the nausea has been difficult. It also triggers panic for me. With time, it has improved, though not completely. I eat cold applesauce, put an ice pack on my chest while breathing, sip cold ginger ale, and have a peppermint. I hope it improves quickly for you. I know it can be quite rough."

175913257,"holy crap... i can't imagine experiencing that. in all honestly I am very glad you are still here today. Just think, you wouldn't be who you are if it wasn't for all those (crappy) experiences. I have to think like that. I wouldn't be me without going though what I did. I hate how emotional I am, but I love how I am in general. I was in therapy today and commented about this website to her. She's never heard of it. Kinda shocked me. She was was like ""You see?"" It was funny, because also I go to Physical/Rehab therapy for balancing. The topic of bi-polar came about and the lady told me the same exact info the main therapist said. It's like you all are telling me to go for it. Just so bizarre to me :'D The topic of my dad came up and I spoke of something that was fun. I thought of the old times for a minute. It almost felt like it was a dream b/c I haven't thought about it such a long time... My dad took me and a friend to a different city to learn/audition to model. We were maybe 9 years old, can'
t remember the age. We were able to go b/c of one of his clients. He asked if I wanted to go, I said yes. So it happened. LOL You said , ""It might be because of a woman who gave me some advice at an All-Anon meeting, which I want to tell you about later."" Would you like to share now?"
175913258,"Just remember all the stupid stuff we all do. I still remember the time I was in fifth grade and I called my friend crippled instead of handicapped, and she was so offended she made our other friend punch me in the stomach hard. Keeps me up at night sometimes, but I doubt she even remembers it at all."
175913259,"Your mind seems to be torturing you. I'm sorry <3.. What meds are you on? Is the Vyvanse in 60mg or 30mg pills? If they're 30mg's, I'd take one 30mg tomorrow instead of two.. Maybe that could help to decrease the voices... A PRN antipsychotic could help.. Or benzo.. The lady that cuts your hair - I'd tell her respectively that you're very stressed out and don't feel like talking. That's what I'd do.. Idk.."
175913260,I never did affirmations. I got my generally high self esteem from all the really wonderful Christian religious books I’ve read.
175913261,"I tried blonanserin, it is not that effective as risperidone and you require high doses of blonanserin like 8mg to 16mg .It is not available in western countries too."
175913262,If I take a high enough dose of antipsychotics I stop hearing voices. Although I did hear a couple breakthrough voices recently but it was like once in like a year so I’m not going to up the dose any higher because it is already pretty high

174331849,"Hello, its been awhile since ive posted last. Ive been doing absolutely nothing of interest other than going back on risperidone instead of abilify. Currently im being stalked by alot of people, the squirrel won anyways lol. Anyways, the minor existential thoughts ive been having, are now in a neat little pile. I might make flash cards of them for fun, while i go search for more wonder. One of the thoughts is where do thoughts come from and go? It seems like the brain as an obvious answer, but how do they work? The atoms are invisible and made me think about consciousness as a whole. Do we even exist? What if everything you dont see never happened from across the world? _PERSON_ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AkoML0_FiV4 is still an interesting thought, when it was bought up to a friend of mine. He couldnt stop thinking about it. Weirdly, he has stopped talking with me. He was so intelligent and knew alot. Reminding me that life is merely an aberration. I recently learned about the double slit exper
iment in physics. Tldr electrons behave like waves. The looming thought of death comes and goes like an eerie friend pretty often. Is there an afterlife besides being broken down and remade into something else in nature? My delusions make me check the time pretty often these days, i think how time just keeps going without stopping. Time travel? _PERSON_ talk, how it would work. But what if the past, present and future are all occuring at the same time, thus we might never time travel. Is the Universe proof that something can go faster then the speed of light? Is the Universe considered mass or not? On another note, the stalking has stayed the same mostly. The people spend all their time thinking of ways to mess with me. It has become alot worse, but its mostly just an annoyance now. Do psychic powers exist? _PERSON_…"
175913274,"My mother made a few moves on me, and it really made me upset for a couple of days, but then I dismissed it. I loved my mother, but her presence was always a pain for me. It was because she didn’t understand how sensitive I was about my masculinity. She treated me more like I was her kid. That was painful for me. I think she realized that after a while, but most of the damage had already been done. I wish she had just kicked me out of the house when I was 22."

175913288,I understand that too I certain hope you can put those thoughts out of mind though that people are out to hurt you people shouldn’t live in fear.

175913290,Well done for getting back on track.
174331848,"It is one of my hypotheses! Yknow the way meth addicts eventually start being paranoid? Police scanners and radios.. shadows around the corners of eyeballs.. sit in the corner and smoke the rest until nightfall.. Dopamine! Stimulant psychosis.. Adderall.. methylphenidate... Then there's a different type of schizophrenia.. ""I don't have schizophrenia and neither do I"".. DID.. multiple personality disorder.. which can be confused for schizophrenia.. That meme causes major offense for _USER_ID_ in schiz.. but psychedelics can exacerbate schizophrenia right? Psychedelics are tryptamine derivatives.. they mimic serotonin.. serotonin is 5-hydroxy-tryptamine.. That's why they help with depression and anxiety.. My dopamine schizophrenia was cured by antipsychotics.. I never had psychosis from stimulants.. maybe because of the antipsychotics? Idk.. But the psychedelics helped me with depression (Negative symptoms and avoidant personality disorder).. It reset my brain.. MDMA (Biggest serotonin releaser - 2
0x while meth is 3x serotonin release) caused me to have psychosis.. meth did a little because it released serotonin.. Abilify got rid of my delusions while increasing paranoia (Dopamine partial agonist) while invega stopped paranoia (serotonin antagonist). So I'm working on these thoughts because it's very complicated.. glutamate etc.. plays a part too.. like how bipolar is more likely to have seizures.. bipolar meds are anti-seizure meds and benzos are too.. they stop anxiety, psychedelic trips, psychedelic flashbacks.. etc..

175913299,For me my mom and sister have stage four cancer...apparently their hospital already said they won’t qualify for a ventilator if they get sick. My dad is old and my bf has asthma plus this Epstein Barr infection already. I think to some extent I’ve already accepted the fact that I’ll be the last one living. I guess I already grieved once the cancer set in so now I’m kinda like thinking that it won’t be just me but everyone who is watching someone they love die. Like a mass grief. I think I mentioned this to _PERSON_ not sure if I put it on here or not. In December I saw the grim reaper...supposedly if you see him but live you become a reaper yourself when you die. It has me convinced I’m doomed to watch everyone die. I mean it may have been a hallucination but man I’ve never had one so detailed....he was made of billowing shadows. Of course diseases like corona are why I became a microbiologist in the first place. When I was twelve I had a serious reaction to the chickenpox and couldn
t walk. Diseases have shaped my life since I was a child and they will probably shape it now. It will be terrible but so long as you are around to remember it will give meaning to their lives....if you are gone and no one remembers that would be worse.

174331846,"I’ve had similar delusions. Even seen people jump out of the TV in a past life while schizophrenic. Sometimes, I think it’s aliens or dark magic but then I realize the power of the mind and how powerful mine was and how ?????? I’m with schizophrenia. The mind is a powerful thing to waste. I thought it was designed to drive me crazy and insane and it was just physics or EM. I don’t know. I recalled the past life while dreaming and I was there. I’ll admit I’ve hallucinated in my past lives. I think it’s totally possible but so remote that you’re likely to not have experienced a real phenomenon. Usually with the TV, it sends me messages. It doesn’t talk to me. Same thing with youtube videos it’s like a code. I don’t think some guy is paid to pull the strings, but it could be alien ai or some ???? but I just have to give up sometimes and accept the more likely answer is I’m crazy."

174331868,"I’m a 16 year old male who in the past few months has experienced increasing schizophrenic symptoms. At first, I played everything off as just my mind acting crazy and stuff like that, but the symptoms got to a point where it became obvious I should get a diagnosis just to make sure I’m not schizophrenic. I get hallucinations more and more often, mostly tactile, with some odd combination of visual. I feel things that aren’t real, normally incredibly horrible things like my veins squirming trying to leave my body or my fingernails melting off, that sort of stuff. I say that they are kind of visual because I kind of see the hallucination but at the same time I don’t? It is really hard to explain in like human language. I sometimes receive audible hallucinations, but they aren’t telling me to do things, rather they are random people having random conversations, often about mundane things. The horrible part is they overlap and are played directly into my head, like more direct than headphones 
its like code being transmitted into my brain directly. I also sometimes get taste hallucinations but they aren’t really an issue, its more like sometimes I can taste the invisible waves in the air, like the internet (it doesn’t taste great). I also deal with great paranoia and anxiety, and for certain things, psychosis. I only sort of believe my delusions, it is kind of hard to explain because I realize some of them are not real later but I constantly fall for them. The oddest in my opinion is about doctors in submarines trying to control me, which I first heard from a schizophrenic character in a sci-fi show called The 4400. I said it as a joke at first with friends when they would call me a schizophrenic as a joke, but I began to actually believe in submarine doctors. I had bloodwork done a few weeks ago and after the shots I thought that the submarine doctors had injected me with something and I had really weird pains and hallucinations surrounding being drugged for like 8-10 hours, it was not fun. I 
constantly check places for bugs that the submarine doctors may have placed. I know this is crazy, because why would there be doctors IN SUBMARINES trying to spy on me, some 16 year old boy. Okay so at this point I am finally realizing that I am actually ranting hard and this has nothing to do with my issue. So I want to get a diagnosis and hopefully get some form of treatment as I am being attracted to hard drugs to stop the symptoms and I do not want that. I finally worked up the courage to tell my parents that I think I’m schizophrenic and want a diagnosis. They just think I have drug-induced anxiety and spend to much time on the internet and they disregarded everything I said. No matter how hard I try they will not listen to me. I really need help as my mental state is very rapidly declining and I am very much so in pain. TL;DR How can I get a diagnosis from a psychiatrist for schizophrenia if my parents will not allow me. I am 16 years old and American, so keep in mind I am a minor."

I wore pearl and diamond earrings, a pearl and diamond choker, and had a pearl and diamond clip attached to my veil.

174331911,"Do you guys know of or have any favorite books or films with schizophrenic characters, preferably fictional? I have some books I intend to read with schizophrenic characters, such as a blue so dark by holly schindler, the boy who could see demons by _NAME_, made you up by _NAME_ zappia, I never promised you a rose garden (of course), and a head full of ghosts by _NAME_ tremblay. I have yet to actually read any of them though because I expect them to hit close to home and probably make me cry (I had a children’s book about a girl who could see ghosts make me tear up from reminding me of my illness recently. It happens a lot). For films, I have yet to actually watch any movies with specifically schizophrenic characters that are realistic portrayals (aka not stigmatized). However, I watch a lot of horror films and find I can find a lot of the stories very relatable to my illness even if it’s not what it’s about. The common scenario of a character being terrified for their lives and not being bel
ieved they’re in danger because their claims are ridiculous is obviously relatable. Any film in which a character’s mind betrays them, a character discovers they have supernatural powers (especially psychic powers), or a character escaping into a fantasy world, even if it’s just their imagination and not mental illness, reminds me of what it’s like to have schizophrenia for me. _NAME_’s latter is a standout one, _NAME_’s baby up until the end reveal feels very relatable because _NAME_ we’re led to believe is just paranoid, a tale of two sisters is about a girl having hallucinations to cope with grief and guilt, and pan’s labyrinth (not quite horror but close) is about a girl using her imagination to cope with the horrors around her. Other than horror, I don’t have much I relate to, but that’s because horror is pretty much all I watch. My taste in books is much more diverse. The only real non-horror film I can think of is an obvious choice, _NAME_ in Wonderland. Any books or films you know 
of or recommend with schizophrenic characters? And while we’re on the subject, what kind of things in films remind you of your illness? I’m curious if anyone else has specific things they relate to even if it’s not necessarily what they experience."

175913559,"For almost four years I kept my diagnosis secret and during this time I also imposed my own exile from society. Before I became unwell, I was vibrant, social, I worked and had many friends, but when this illness was afflicted, I disappeared. I changed my number and also removed all social media profiles. Two months ago I was given the opportunity to fulfil a dream of mine to give a _NAME_ X talk and I used this opportunity address the _USER_ID_ with mental ill health but also to tell my friends and family who did not know why I had to disappear. This was met with such positive reactions. And, just this weekend I reactivated my Facebook and posted the link to my talk, I was anxious but i subsequently received innumerable private messages from friends who also suffer from conditions who also felt they had to hide and keep it quiet, including many responses from both acquaintances and old friends who have shown unprecedented support. I write this post for those of you, who once like myself, may be too 
ashamed or afraid to be themselves, to tell others in fear of rejection. Your time will come when you will no longer feel afraid. I now feel free, previously this secret kept me enslaved. If you do want to watch, here is my talk: https://youtu.be/RSSZxcVvgnQ"

I took up vaping to quit smoking, and took to it right away. Some people have a hard time quitting the smokes entirely, but it still saves money. Thing is, buy your stuff on-line/wholesale, and mix your own juice. I must have cut my monthly “smoke” bill by 70%. Also, you could do what I used to do…Get up at 4-5 am, go out for a walk…“Help keep the streets clean”. That and rolling papers… There is always an option, but to use it, you do sorta have to be here. Have a good moan, it helps, then go walkies, or look into vaping."

Depression is very real, and you deserve to feel validated. It so easily takes over, as it's hard to control these feelings.

Goes like this: end of each day, have a journal, write 3 detailed things you're thankful for. Nothing hinting at negativity is key here.

It was a relationship that was frowned upon when we were both in hospital and frowned upon when we left hospital together. A lot of relationships that were formed in hospital did breakdown sooner or later, when couples were living together in the community. A possible reason why men are less likely to live independently is the earlier age at which schizophrenia strikes. That means that the life skills needed to live independently are sidelined by the illness at a point where people without illness are learning the necessary life skills. Women are more likely to learn those life skills before illness strikes. It would be interesting to see how things would pan out if research was focussed on both males and females with sz that developed in the late teens vs sz that developed in both males and females in the mid 20s."

Currently, I do sports, music, and I also read… and I use some apps to learn English ! My social life is far better than before. I’ve met a friend in my city, among overs. I still have a little social phobia but it’s ok now. Concerning the apps, I’ve tested “Babbel” (someone here know it ?) and a wonderful app which is called “Gymglish”. This one is really really cool, but also very expensive. Finally, I choose _PERSON_ cause it’s a good and complete application. A friend of mine gave me the address of a website to learn english : elllo. Well, i’m pretty motivated. I’ve contacted a piano teacher, who could help me to improvise on the piano. He seems really nice and especially gifted. I phoned a woman who helped me at the time. (she was a social worker.) We’ll see each other again ! Hope a new friendship !

175913639,Hi folks. Check in if you have the time. _PERSON_
174331936,"Try rexulti if possible, it has slightly less side effects than abilify. Also, check the clinical trial for your country and see if they have any new antipsychotic up for trial"
175913640,My mum said that to me too. No one has broken my heart as much as her. It hurts.
175913641,I’ll be getting my groceries delivered tonight. Yet again I wonder what they’ll be able to bring. Online grocery shopping is like a casino now.
174331955,"I believe they come and go. One year ago, I remember, I was saying “nothing helps with negatives, I will be like this forever.” I was always lying on the couch watching whatever was on the tv. Stupid TV. Now I can walk, write my religious essays, my little book about my religion etc."
175913642,Cool now I wanna draw too!!! I love it
175913643,"Maybe join a clubhouse for adults with mental illness. There would probably be varying levels of people with different functioning levels, but it would probably be a good place to meet like-minded individuals. I’ve been meaning to join my local clubhouse."
175913644,? always screwed up at my jobs.making perfect jobs for me its just impossible task and i just gave up. ?t s really to hard to meet normies standards at jobs. They are too perfectionist
174331960,Yes we cant do without the medication or we go mad
175913645,"They protect better than nothing, and the hospitals are reporting a month or less left of masks. You might as well get started now."
175913646,Oh that’s sad. I’m sorry you got let down.
174331940,Yeah it is normal to have social problems in childhood before you get sz. Just saying I think a lot of people with sz end up getting misdiagnosed. sciencedirect.com Childhood behavioral precursors of adult symptom dimensions in schizophrenia The present investigation tested the hypothesis that childhood behavioral problems are differentially associated with clinical symptoms in adult-onset…
175913647,I see commercials every day on channel 4 in Jacksonville.
175913648,Mood definetly effects the way you think. Worth looking into. The doctors wont always consider it after giving you a diagnosis.
175913649,"I'm positive most of the time but I have those thoughts underlying/in the background that creep out every now and then. Like, I always have that option in the back of my head"
175913650,Thanks for posting rubes it means a lot thanks
175913651,Yes. I know lol. But it was freaky to hear the apt breathe. You hug trees? I like the idea of sleeping in a tree.
175913652,Very nice _AT_MENTION_! Looks great so far.
175913653,I’ve never suspected someone of having multiple accounts. I never really thought about it.
174331941,The rules and guidelines can be found here
175913654,You think it would be but it’s not. I’ve tried that too many times always failed. But im not being negative it’s just not a viable option for me. I think what needs to happen is for me to be able to rely on myself more regarding emotional support. Fill in gaps by myself where there are some.
174331937,Now you've all got me craving a meatball sub. Haven't had one in a long time. Might have to see about getting those frozen meatballs sometime and trying them out
175913655,"I wonder if you're actually a pushover, or if it's the fact that truly manipulative people are good at what they do. I've seen very assertive people fall prey to manipulation and other mind games before. It isn't about who you are, but about who manipulative people are."
174331942,"I can’t read all this thread. Blame the sz. Enlightenment is a chemical process. It’s nothing more or less. Sit in front of a tree for 7 years, have a psychotic break, take drugs. It’s all chemical. Whether you learn from the process is another question. I read a bit of your work. I think there’s some grandiose delusional thinking there. I don’t think it’s any different from a lot of punters round here. Treatment resistant could be a call but I think your trying clozapine. That could be good for you! Most prophets reach a premature end. Your not that special…unless you take that 1%. Your different from roughly 99% of the population. Welcome to the club…around here your pretty well not different!"
174331939,I assume you don’t take meds?
175913656,…and also that’s the point. You had residual effects of AP.

175913658,Hey good morning _PERSON_!
175913659,I don’t think infections in your gums/teeth will kill you before Monday. Your dentist can prescribe antibiotics.
175913660,They have offered me help but I would rather be homeless than take money from them This goes back to when I was a drug addict and I used my parents support to in part fund my drug addiction I swore I would never have anything from them ever again
175913661,"Good job, Blue! Where do you watch mass on TV or whatever? How do you do that?"
175913662,My sz is non drug induced; so I will likely have it for rest of my life. Even though I can go off medication and do well for years; I inevitability have a subsequent psychosis. I would ask a social worker or non profit mental health organization for advice regarding disability rules in your state/country.
174331965,"My right wedding finger has been shaking uncontrollably, and my face is having little twitches. I’m on Abilify. I’m 24 years old. It’s scaring me. I’ve been on Abilify for a while , since February, but these twitches only started recently."

175913666,Yeah I failed guys. I might try again sometime in the future.
175913667,Suicide isn’t the answer. Stay with us and talk it through. I know you’re in pain but you can make it through this keep reaching out for help.
175913668,"It sounds like you might have a brain inflammation. I would take some anti-inflammatories if you have anything at hand like vitamin C, turmeric, oregano, lemon balm, true licorice. I have had good effects from onion and garlic as well. If you don’t have any, I suggest buying one or more as tea that you can drink 2-3 times a day."

175913670,"Also, if you happen to be spiritual or believe in a higher power, this would be a great opportunity to ask it/him/her for help in understanding or interpreting the voices/images, pain or confusion!"
175913671,You think so? I just believe that everything influences everything in the universe

175913677,"thanks _AT_MENTION_ ,I’ve just read your post.Same here!"
175913678,Just want quiet. Starting to give up hope that the demons will ever go away for good. They always come back. They never stay away. What's the point in fighting them if they are just gonna keep coming back? What's the point in fighting at all really?
175913679,I’m thinking of going back on it
175913680,"Yeah. I took some meds that made me paranoid, anxious and delusional. It was supposed to have the opposite effect. Now I don’t touch the stuff."
175913681,Invega made it worse for me. I have personality disorder was diagnosed schzioaffective. Gabapentin helped restless and agitated and restless legs at first then made it worse. I’m only on strattera now And researching lamictal but honestly doing pretty okay with just exercise counseling
175913682,I’m glad you feel taken care of
175913683,Yeah both would probably be too stressful to do at once

175913687,Depression is sometimes worse than psychosis it sucks the life out of everything I only have depression for a month or so after a relapse but then stabilise to normal levels
174331951,The genesight test takes 30 days to get back so I don’t know yet what that is going to say. I can stay focused or on task very long even with this high dose of seroquel. But seroquel by far has been the best I have taken to help keep me calm and to sleep. I don’t hardly have any positive symptoms anymore but seroquel doesn’t help me at all with negative symptoms. But everyone’s body chemistry is different and reacts different from one person to another. I don’t ever want to get off seroquel.
175913688,You gotta exercise more and eat less if you want to lose weight _AT_MENTION_ The meds will make you hungry. I used to have a problem in that department too. You just gotta learn to control it. GL

175913692,I think it sort of gets worse before it gets better. But I believe it will help.
174331953,"First psychiatrist said I had psychosis, then it went to undifferentiated schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffecive, bipolar and now… anxiety"
174331956,"I do it alot with imaginary scenarios and conversations with imaginary people done it for ever i dont talk out loud but my mouth might move thats what i call “day dreaming”, i know my mum does it and shes not schizophrenic she calls it “thinking aloud”. With the schizophrenia i have had conversations with hallucinations and that is very different then day dreaming."
175913693,Good luck to you. I hope you are right.
175913694,I cannot work without coffee
175913695,You need to ask your Dr or pharmacist. I took narcotics pain killers after I had surgeries. It was prescription Codeine. It made me euphoric and couldn’t sleep at all at night.
175913696,Meds and staying away from religion and politics. Good thing that these 2 topics are banned here.

175913709,"I’ll see if my library carries it. Ever seen Basket Case, _AT_MENTION_? It’s one of my top favorite movies of all time. It’s super trashy and low budget. But there’s just something very charming about it."
175913710,"So I did a bit of research. Well more than a bit but not super extensive. Probably just an hour or two of research. I found a very good website of reputable agents/publishers looking for different types of books. So I’m gonna craft a book proposal for a nonfiction memoir. They say if it’s done right it’ll take a few weeks but I don’t understand why unless there’s breaks in between. Apparently you don’t have to have a whole manuscript for nonfiction books. Usually only for fiction books. You submit proposals for nonfiction. And if an agent picks it up, then you start to write and finish it."

175913712,"Hey! I struggle with this type of stuff all the time. I had eye issues and breathing issues and every doctor said I was okay. I do suggest going to an integrative medicine doctor if you are able to unfortunately it gets very expensive but mine has helped me immensely bc sometimes it could just be simple chemicals in body making you feel this way and most doctors don’t do as intense research and integrative medicine doctors can definitely help. I can relate I had a lot of anxiety when I was about 19 and I wasn’t able to swallow food because it would get stuck in my throat and everyone said it was in my head. Doctors said I had GERD and no medication would help, eventually I had an endoscopy, and he said you have spasms in your esophagus which is why you can’t swallow, but then he told me that they are only caused by stress and anxiety. Once my anxiety reduced my symptoms went away. I just wanted to share that story because you may be truly feeling these issues and having pain, but it can just 
be anxiety. Don’t worry you will get through this.!!!"

174331961,"About Schizophrenia Bulletin Open Schizophrenia Bulletin Open (SBO), a new Open Access companion journal to Schizophrenia Bulletin , views the field of research on schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders as broad and deep, and will publish new knowledge ranging from the molecular basis of psychosis to social and cultural factors that affect psychotic illnesses. We will review recent developments and empirically based hypotheses regarding classification, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. We will also give new emphasis to translational reports which simultaneously highlight basic neurobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations. Some of SBO’s content will be invited as special features or manuscripts organized as a theme by special guest editors. Most pages of SBO are devoted to unsolicited manuscripts of high quality that report original data or where we can provide a special venue for a major study 
or workshop report. Supplement issues are sometimes provided for manuscripts reporting from a recent conference. https://academic.oup.com/schizbullopen/pages/About"

175913717,that’s good! Killing somebody won’t fix anything anyways
175913718,I didn’t find it useful and I have just had my first psychosis relapse after 10 years… I don’t think pushing myself now is a good idea although I am looking for work but I am taking my time.

175913721,Yeah _PHONE_NO_
174331962,Oh ok.I used to kinda think that people might not think I’m well actually but I haven’t consciously thought about it in a while. When My voices told me that I would be more than a schizophrenic they meant it in a bad way like I would be more insane than a schizophrenic. Thanks for that _AT_MENTION_

175913724,"When I was a baby, a dog knocked me over and I hit my head on concrete. It forgot it but was left with a fear of falling - falling asleep, falling in love and just plain falling. It was and is very painful. I think it’s a reason I don’t want to get our of bed."

175913728,I believe the ap medicines block people from getting more insane. I’m not sure if I’m correct though. I have a hunch. I think they do other things as well.
175913729,I’ve learned that most normies could care less about what we go through. It’s a sad reality.

175913738,I’ve never experienced full blown psychosis. The furthest I’ve gone even when unmedicated has been to post unsubstantiated metaphysical claims on this forum. My case is a bit of a joke to be honest.
175913739,"Brain feels like it’s burning from lack of sleep. I think I’m hypomanic but not that bad because of meds. I just got my Lamictal upped to 100mg from 50mg though, could it be the cause of the hypo? I’ve been feeling chatty and can talk for hours to people, something that I normally can’t because I need to recharge my battery by being alone."

Some “natural” or gourmet groceries sell them, at least here (major US city). Just got to make sure it’s broccoli and not alfalfa or bean sprouts."
175913744,Hell. Sim. Call it whatever you must. But yeah. Sertraline helped mine.

175913746,"I'm sorry you feel this way. I think we are all feeling very similar as well. I think it's the feeling of no control. How will we get back to normal? I know I've had the same feelings. I've had several panic attacks about this virus and dying. What worked for me is thinkjng about things in my control. Yes, you are working from home. Safe and away from potentially picking up the virus working in a hospital. The fears trying to take over but don't let it. You have to think about the positives. Your daughter needs you to be strong for her. How many would be sad if you weren't there. I know it's hard sometimes. Take small steps. Try to do 1 thing each day that makes you at ease. Even watching ashow together. Just enjoying each other's company. Go on a short walk together after dinner. That helps clear the mind. I don't watch the news as often, that helps. Take one day at a time. This will pass."

175913749,when I wake up in the morning and I ask myself… level 3 is that my shirt being ironed or the ????? being scorned
175913750,An “AHA” moment allowed me to know that the demon delusion was not real. I touched an icon of my religion- nothing happened. Also I remembered that my priest said he cannot find anything wrong with me.
175913751,Upset. My mom texted offering to help pay some of my bills and then she backs out. I already screenshot my accounts to her. Very very upset about this.
175913752,I took my night meds last night around 8 PM and I took my morning meds around 5:30 this morning.
175913753,I took one tonight to sleep and im felling ????
175913754,I am. In sickness and in health I’m on my side.
175913755,i sleep about 10 hours per night… i don’t feel too sleepy during the day though… when i was in psych ward i would take naps during the day but at home i don’t.
175913756,Could you please use a trigger warning when you're talking about hearts and blood etc? Sorry but I'm very squeamish and under a fvck of a lot of stress locked in with disgusting people in my room.
175913757,"I've had it since I was in my 20's, yes. I believe that suicidal ideation becomes a habit. Anymore, unless I'm feeling truly unsafe, I look upon the suicidal thoughts as just blah-blah-blah. Just random thoughts running through my mind."
175913758,And yes they are aware I saw videos in my university psychology classes of patients describing their different personalities.
175913759,"Honestly, I play guitar, I write music and lyrics. With my children we work on ideas for our kids book, now along with being teacher too. I like to fish. Love the outdoors. All these things are the reason why I need the therapy. When I happen across a trigger sometimes I want to go use (""want to"" currently is as far as it gets), sometimes I hit my fist into the side of my head as hard as I can, repeatedly (yesterday), sometimes I steal or shoplift, sometimes i pick a fight. This is also the reason I need therapy. The problem for me is there are triggers for the good emotions and actions, just like there are triggers for the bad. Now _USER_ID_ perception a little. Take the Halo off, dig in that back pocket for your horns and place them up top. What we are expecting the future to bring us all wrapped up with ribbons and personal opinions, also defines what is positive and what is negative. If my goal is to dam the river to hold the water for preservation. A finished dam would be a positive and the 
destroyed dam a negative. To the conservationist who wants to see the canyon restored to it's natural state, a completed dam is a negative and the destroyed dam the positive. I want chocolate you want vanilla, right? With me it's more like, I will take 3 chocolate, 3 vanilla, 2 swirl, and yes they are all for me. That's only if we compare society to McDonald's ice cream selection. BUT, society is a Baskin Robbins and its not just vanilla or chocolate. They have like 6,897 different flavors. I can't even pick a favorite color or song. Overall I am happy. This is a struggle but I'm happy to do it in exchange for an actual identity. I will make it. Reaching out for support helps. Support even in the form of a smile or a giggle at their joke that isn't funny can change the entire mood of someone with mental illness. Humor is such good medicine, but never if it is harmful to another. Sometimes it shows support not to laugh. I also feel the need to share.

I think sarcosine is the one thing we have for the concentration, motivation, cognition stuff, right? social impairment should prob be up there. I can fake it fine, i used my time at university to watch how people interacted in classroom settings and learned to mimic their expressions and tone of voice, etc…it is very exhausting and drains me of energy to interact, but people tell me i dont come off as awkward or whatev, but that is just my acting abilities lol i was looking at some books for adhd in adults and another book executive functioning, but didnt finish either (darn you, lack of concentration!). it was about using a worksheet style program to improve executive functioning but i didnt read much. wish there were more med and non-med ways to treat negative symptoms."

And after 2 months it all went away. Tbh idk if I needed to be on that dose though because second time round wen I went off meds n got psychotic I was put on 5mg abilify and the thought broadcasting etc went away on 5mg too. Maybe it needed a higher dose the first time round I’m not sure. But the doctors didn’t give me the choice verbally to experiment with 5mg first which I find very annoying"

And sometimes I find when I worry about things I am more prepared for worst and then almost always it works out better, so although I worried for nothing, it was worth it if I expect the best I sometimes get disappointed so prefer to prepare for negative events possibly occurring.

174331976,"I know what you meant. I’m just saying your words were offensive. Because if I could choose to have everyone see me as straight and just get on with my life, without hate and judgment and rejection, I would choose that in a second. I can’t choose that. I wish I could. Being gay is being different and being hated and judged through no choice of your own. It’s unfair. And that identity is not something that you just decide to wear for some short while until you figure things out. It’s fine if you’re gay, and I know you didn’t mean to offend.

175913807,Sorry it is like this for you. I also have a massive issue with trusting people can be good for or to you. It makes me behave in a way which then results in the inevitable — people want to be unkind because they think that’s what I am used to it actually like.

I’ve just started trialling some supplements suggested on this site’s home page for sz. NAC, melatonin, L-Theanine. They seem to be helping…better sleep, positive emotions, energy at work. The improvements are subtle but important. So if you haven’t already it might be worth trying some to see how you respond. Keep up the good work on the Clozapine"

175913842,"Yes, it is a comfort to know what we are. We first have to get our diagnosis correct before we can get medicated correctly. I remember when I first found out what I was. I was talking to a lay counselor on the phone. I was probably telling him I had been diagnosed as depressed, and probably telling him about the anxiety attacks, which I think I was having at the time. So I was all over the place. And he said, ""I knew your uncle. And he was a manic-depressive, and you probably are, too."" I was very pleased to hear a correct diagnose of me. Again, what was happening was, I went in as depressed to the psychiatrist, he dx'd me as depressed, and gave me an anti-depressant. This sent my depression into mania/panic attacks. Again, wrong dx, wrong medicine, you're not getting any help. The psy. could have asked me, since I was depressed, do you ever have racing thoughts, to see if I was manic-depressed. He didn't ask anything. Because, what I needed as manic-depressed, was a cap (Lithium) put on the anti
-depressant, so I wouldn't go manic from the anti-depressant. There probably isn't anything more unbalanced in your brain, as you say, and that must be very calming. You are not all over the place, you have a mental condition called anxiety disorder. It is not your fault. There is hope. You live in an era when there is medicine. My grandmother did not. You are very lucky. You can have a better situation. You are a good person. It is going to be interesting to see how this goes. Your life could be improving.

175913859,"super20dan said... Xanax should NEVER be used for sleep. fastest way to become addicted. same for klonipin. That all depends on your potential to get addicted. I'm very fortunate to only have ""drug seeking behavior"" towards sweets, especially ice cream, which I address by only buying a little of them every once in a while. And I occasionally use Klonopin to get to sleep in the following pattern: a fairly low dose of Seroquel is the only way I'll get more than 4 hours of sleep a night, so I take that, US standard time, 7:30 pm, and I tend to fall asleep 8:30-9 pm. If I'm still awake by 10-11 pm, I take ""enough"" Klonopin so the underlying tension/stress gets relieved so I can fall asleep. Which isn't actually using it to fall asleep, just sets up the necessary conditions, but that might be a distinction without a difference. _USER_ID_ took more than a year to work through 40 doses (half pills) of Xanax, which suggests a way to test your addiction potential: get or keep available only a small amou
nt of a benzodiazepine or Z-drug, not more than 1 week's worth, perhaps less, but as far as I know you won't get badly physically adapted to it from 1 steady week of it. If you can take only some of it, or all of it steadily over the week, and stop, maybe you can use these dangerous drugs safely. I think they have their place for what I call ""breakthrough"" anxiety, but like _USER_ID_, I have a low addiction potential for them. That's obviously not true for a lot of people."

However, if I am diagnosed with schizophrenia- which I fear I might be- then I can’t work for a charity. This is because a diagnosis of schizophrenia would interfere with my ability to drive & interact with people. In addition, my dad has this hatred of social media.

I thought i had some purpose to serve that would lead to greatness. Then i became atheist. Decided serving my country through the military would be a good way to live and die. Again, though i had a special purpose. Then I became schizophrenic. Realized my mother probably was too as she saw and heard a lot of weird sht (saw an octopus on the wall which constricted her, she thought it was the devil himself.)

I think, that you can get better with time, this is my point! Even your negatives can get better with time, believe me. The main is to be relatively calm with the help of the meds and just try to push yourself a bit even if its small steps… If you don’t have friends, use your parents to talk to someone at least… The negatives are a better thing for the pdocs in general, they are not so life dangerous… You can get better on this. Plus believe me, many people outside are alone too, even while not being ill… Make your b

Certain supplements are there for improving sleep but can’t type here as its against forum rules. I think cognitive symptoms are also linked to poor sleep quality. So make an effort to get deep restful sleep at night. 8 or 9hrs of uninterrupted sleep helps. Certain helpful habits to achieve this include. Avoid caffeine beverages after 6 PM like tea, coffee etc. Avoid naps during day. Try to remain as much busy during day time.

175913966,"In a theoretical world where all basic needs were covered in full, we have different ideas about how to pay. Mr. Star wants to eliminate all taxes except a 10-50% sales tax on all purchased items. Items would fall into different tax classes based on essentiality and base cost. So like, a basic, no frills car would only be 10%. A Jaguar would be closer to 50%. Food, water, and clothes below a certain price would be tax free, as they are essential goods. I think we could pay for the system by closing up the loopholes that allow people to report losses on the stock market, and keeping a graduating tax that does not stop at a certain income level. And make few/no tax breaks for companies, and reclassify churches as for-profit businesses."

Take marking my bag straps with a paint marker as a simple example making them easier to adjust. Today i have spent time on my dressing table mainly doing some more final work on it and a fundamental advancement was made with my clothing i wear when i am at my place. You cant dry clothes in a tumble dryer that have metal parts to them like metal eyelets for the drawstring or metal ends on the drawstring.

It honestly looks more like a little acne than anything, but I did notice it before when I was trying out Cymbalta a few months back. It seemed to go away when my Cymbalta was decreased, and was not much of an issue on the Lexapro. However, the Lexapro wasn't helping with depression so I had to try something else. Has anyone experienced this too? Do you think it sounds like just a side effect or a possible allergic reaction of some sort? Thanks in advance!"

Increasing evidence implicates that both SIRT1 and BDNF closely related to the development of depression.

175914051,"Cholls, in your eyes, are there any non-corrupt major philanthropists? While I agree _PERSON_ is certainly in a position to do a lot of the things you've mentioned, anyone who does anything in the public eye is a target for misconstrued information and slander. Currently, most people don't even know or acknowledge that his focus is on more than just medical research or profitable enterprises (ex: disadvantaged youth programs and charities) People get off on scandal and drama < The greater the contrast, the more interested and excited people get. Same with conflation and ""us or them"" narratives. Part of why I would like to not believe it, is because I'd be a bit disheartened to think that someone like _PERSON_ didn't have at least some greater degree of altruistic motives. He's a nice story ^ Geeky genius kid makes it big by inventing something that changed the world. Doesn't let his success and riches get to his head. Instead, stays grounded enough to contribute to the world through multiple diff
erent types of philantrophy. All the while, instead of living away in an icey, barren tower and sitting on a pile of gold like a dragon ( ), he stays connected to idealistic things like community and family values (which _PERSON_, whom I deeply respect, suggests are a component of humanity's need for tribe which is lacking in the developed world and contributing to the increase in chronic stress, poor relationships, poor parenting, behavioral disorders in children, addiction, trauma, etc.) Anyways, I dislike pharmaceuticals, but I begun getting the flu vaccine when my deceased boyfriend was getting chemotherapy - and I have to say, it was the first time in many years that I didn't spend the most of the winter sick with the flu < I was very appreciative and have been getting them ever since. [On an aside, I have my own conspiracy theories on chemotherapy and other cancer treatments] That being said, I must say that I've often wondered what would happen if I ever ended up not being able to get a flu shot - woul
d the body have a decreased effectiveness in creating its own antibodies to deal with it? ^ Since I don't know how the science of any of this works, I'd say that it was my body's only real practice in putting forth any serious exertion in coming up with antibodies and adapting to viral mutations. But unless I want people jumping down my throat, while getting labeled an ""antivaxxer,"" I can't even ask those questions. I think this whole debate and the connotation of being a conspiracy theorist, has led to people being unwilling or afraid to even talk about this subject in more than just black and white terms ^ And, I think part of the function of conspiracy theories is to further divide people (can you tell I look up to _PERSON_?) Because of overtly false and extremist ideas, people laugh off any serious questions antivaxxers pose ^ And honestly, that study linking vaccines to autism that was later exposed to have contained fabricated information made things a lot worse for their cause. Don't get me wrong, I 
believe ""the powers that be"" are corrupt enough and able to shut-down information that hinders their own agendas. But, it's foolish to think that just because science has rules and methods in place, it means those within it will act ethically (even if their ""ends"" to their ""means"" are justified by good intentions) < This could risk being especially true when one is deeply passionate or fanatical about a cause (or the rewards or agenda behind a cause). ^ Interestingly, it can also account for the mention of HPV research that endangered the health of other (viewed as disposable) human beings that was being done in other countries to decrease answering to the board of ethics in more regulated countries. We all know that science has tried to find ways of cutting the corners of ethics for as long as the imposition of ethics in science has been occurring - yet, we rarely complain when they succeed at something that benefits us. Trying to bring myself back to what I was trying to say: It's possible antivaxxer 
research was done incorrectly and maybe dishonestly because they found some type of legitimate concern, but it was not enough to warrant any serious attention - or they hadn't recieved consistent enough results and it would have taken an inconvenient amount of time and patience to get anywhere with it. The faulty researchers may have been onto some valid concerns (which would now be addressed quietly away from the public eye - they have an excuse to be secretive now - avoid mass hysteria and the like); however, they did their cause a great disservice. + Others found the misinformation, latched onto it without looking any further and spread it like wild fire. Additionally, in their antivax campaigns, they also added disproportionate information to bulk up their platform (ex. the vast increase in ASD rates) which has backfired too. ^ To tangent over to what I was recently saying elsewhere for a second, people rarely account for the research you can easily look up that indicates that diagnosticians have become m
ore and more liberal with the ASD diagnosis (because of the ever-widening spectrum continuum of disorders these days) ^ That's where most of the increases are found. The severe end of the ASD spectrum hasn't particularly changed. Now, not only has there been an alarming increase of censorship in general and the shutting down of asking questions, but they may be able to one day enforce mandatory vaccinations for the good of herd immunity. The mockery that comes from more fact-based people makes it worse. ^ Why would people who may be afraid and stressed, who definitely believe something is wrong, do anything other than bristle at and further raise their defenses towards the information that comes from people who laugh and sneer at them (no matter how factual it is)? ^ Especially when they see the blantant and unaddressed flaws in those that mock them (we all have them - ""Johari Window"") I then wonder if the same people who will most benefit from the imposition of censorship and use of force in society, may h
ave quietly given fuel to these conspiracy theories to create a greater adverse reaction in (and increased division between) others? It would be effective.

It has happened because of how human brains work and it will drift away and be replaced by the next thought to come along.” Everyone us weird violent or disturbing thoughts at times. It doesn’t mean you agree with the thought. It just means that’s how human brains process information. For example, when I’m driving down the road, I sometimes think “if I turn my wheel an inch to the side, I will kill everyone in that car.” It used to make me terrified to drive. But now, I don’t mind it. The thought sometimes happens, and when it does I just concentrate on other things and let it pass."

175914072,"It’s a lot, not just here, but in my family life too. I’m just tired of being lied on and accused of things that I didn’t do. Earlier today, for instance, we were talking about sugar intake and I was explaining that I really don’t eat as much sugar as people act like I do. Then, my little brother tried to “rat me out,” saying that he saw me make several oatmeal raisin cookies and eat them myself with a smug ass look on his face, while my other little brother agreed. Of course, once I reminded them that I’m moderately allergic to raisins and dried fruit in general, they were all of a sudden “joking around,” and I was told that I was just taking things too seriously. Someone on here decided they were going to attack me for my “obvious” flagging of people I don’t like, never mind the fact that I very rarely flag people as is, and that 4 or 5 of my grand total of a whopping 9 flags are from 2 threads where there was some misinformation shared, and one from a long since deleted t
hread where I flagged a mod as a joke from within the thread. So from my 15 months on this forum, I’ve flagged someone over their posts 4 times, at most. Ask any mod. Please correct me if I’m wrong. Just stuff like that, all the time, every fu cking day. I’m so fu cking tired of it, you know? note: Before anyone decides that my lifelong allergy to raisins is psychosomatic, know that I had an allergic reaction to a dressing on _NAME_ salad that contained a little bit of raisin sauce, and I couldn’t have known that because my mom made it while I was at school, so I never even saw the dressing."

Some days though, we don’t do much other than watch documentaries (history class) or have a nerf fight (physical education). Today was a good day, but last week he barely completed three assignments."

175914083,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer Moderator"
175914084,"I woke up today and had really bad hangover from the ap’s. I don’t know why, I didn’t do anything special yesterday that I can remember. Probably another mysterious interaction with some food. Luckily I didn’t begin work before 12, but still then I was in bad shape. Ofcourse I try not to let it show and keep a straight face, that’s the way to go I guess. My mood was actually ok, it was just my mind that felt like it was out in a wavy sea. It’s always a bad sign when I have no idea what is happening in the corner of my eyes. I get sort of tunnel vision if the meds hit me too hard. It went alright in the end though. And I managed to study for 2 hours after work although I almost talked myself out of it. I have a deadline to finish my last study report within the next 10 days, so it was really good that I got started this evening. Now I am going to relax and watch a movie or something."

I'm going to slay when it comes to that. Positive: I have my cold diet dr. pepper by my side. At least I have that. I saw a room for rent for just $150 a month which brought me hope that I can find a cheap place to rent in the long term after I move out in nov.

175914178,"I see you went to the hospital. I hope they take you and you get what you need. I think the criteria for commitment varies by location. I’m in the southeastern US and we need to be in imminent danger of harming ourselves or others to be admitted to the typical stabilization hospital. For longer term hospitalizations, there are a few exceptions to that rule. I have friends in other countries who are able to get in and get help before things escalate that far. I’m jealous of that, but my reality is: imminent danger or you are obviously fine (because there is no in between or help until it’s almost too late ) It’s a sad state. But I wonder if the differing responses are related to location. I wish we lived in a world where when we need help we get help without any shameful treatment along the way. I was guessing you may live in rural Midwest US based on your cornfields comment. I’m not 100% certain this would work, but it might help you to find out for certain: where I live we have one hospi
tal that does not have a psych ward. I’ve still gone there when suicidal. They held me for a few hours and then took me by ambulance to a psych unit somewhere else. Same thing when I present to the hospital with one and it’s full. Not that that would help at all in the present situation. But, could be a handy thing to find out. Hopefully your silence is good and you are inpatient getting the help you need. Feel free to contact me when you get out re: being a parent and hospital visits. It’s rough."
175914179,"That’s not a reputable source. No references backig up the claim.All other sources state the maternal instinct affects women.

175914199,"I was able to halve my antipsychotics, which really helped with negatives. Tricky finding the sweet spot between “I’m okay with this” and “This is probably mania”, though. My sweet spot is 6 mg Paliperidone and 1 mg Haldol. At that point, I can’t hear anything hallucination-wise, and I don’t wake up at like 2 AM due to the increased brain activity, which is what happens at 3 mg. With 9 mg Paliperidone, I end up waking at 10:30, which is just too late."

I feel like a failure and every freedom I had feels like it's been took from me. I cant work, drive and I cant even take a bath without my boyfriend being in the house incase I have one in the tub. I was so independent before and I'm having such a hard time accepting my reality now. I also think my OCD is way worse and my ptsd I disassociate alot more than ever and I hate feeling like a robot just going through life. I also feel like my family and friends don't get it they think its because of daily stress that made me have seizures and it's like no it's much more than that. They dont even tell me important things anymore. I

175914300,Here’s a cover of that song:
175914301,"To _PERSON_, I'm new here, and I'm not a medical professional, but just can't not offer this to you: If your son is on disability he should have medicare coverage. Depending on the area in which you live, many states and counties have Mental Health programs that are covered by Medicare. I was fortunate enough to get into a county run program (15 years ago) that offered DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) - a much longer and more involved precursor to CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). It has saved my life, and - as you said - helped me to retrain my brain somewhat .... learn ""tools"" to use to manage the disorder, and over time, when putting those tools to work, we can learn to think and - at a minimum - respond differently. There's no ""cure,"" but it CAN be managed. Also, if he's not in therapy (with a psychiatrist), urge him to do so - preferably one who works within your county's mental health system as he/she can better assist you/him to find one-on-one therapist & groups (in-person & onlin
e(?) ) that are available where you are. Additionally, the psychiatrist can provide medicines that CAN help him ... A combination of medicines and therapy generally works best. Probably the most important thing here is that HE has to want HIS life to change ENOUGH to DO what needs to be done ... and it's hard work. You, nor anyone else, can want it enough for him ... Another ""bit"" that I think important: People with BPD can be very manipulative [I point no fingers that don't point back ;) ] so YOU need help too. I actually gave some of my family members (after reading it myself) the book ""Stop Walking On Eggshells"" by _NAME_, MS & _NAME_. ""Lost In The Mirror"" by _NAME_ A_PERSON_ is another. And I'm certain there are others out there now, but those are two I found to be helpful ... (before I started DBT). Learning about the disorder CAN help you understand better, and getting into a support group for yourself would likely be helpful too. You might check around your area for CODA meetings (free) AND/or _U
SER_ID_. You may need to learn some new strategies to cope with your son's illness and behaviors and to keep yourself from going over the edge too. Hang in there! You're not alon"

175914305,"Thanks guys. I'm feeling better after listening to a video called ""_NAME_ Watts - Confusion In Your Mind"" on YouTube. I'm able to focus better right now and my mind isn't so scattered. I'm able to do what I want. One good quote I heard is that ""When you're perfectly free to feel stuck or not stuck, you are unstuck"" - I knew this. I just needed reassurance."
175914306,"Methylphenidate helped me focus but dextroamphetamine doesn't really. 2 pills does kind of but methylphenidate is bad for the heart. I need a better alternative. Maybe I'm .. well i can't say depressed.. something else.. Like aren't I just really excited all the time about everything? Idk.. also worried that I'm not doing enough.. Enneagram 3... (Look it up) one sec i'll copy and paste.. ""Threes are self-assured, attractive, and charming. Ambitious, competent, and energetic, they can also be status-conscious and highly driven for advancement. They are diplomatic and poised, but can also be overly concerned with their image and what others think of them. They typically have problems with workaholism and competitiveness. At their Best: self-accepting, authentic, everything they seem to be—role models who inspire others."" But I'll figure it out.. By meditating for 90 seconds then worrying that I'm not doing something important lmao"
175914307,A moment at a time…that’s all we do.
174332090,"I suspected that. I myself am still clueless as to what i really have. I have concluded the doctors are just as clueless, maybe even more so, because they do not experience what i experience. In the end, it doesnt really matter what label you get, as long as you get to know your symptoms, what helps and what hurts. That is always very personal. I am trying to teach myself to navigate my issues better. With fluctuating success."

175914313,I just got pregnant and I’m on the lowest dose of resperidone 2mg I need a lot of help here Im not sure if I should cut the pill in half And taper and go lower Or if I should find an alternative medication Or even if I should keep the baby I’ve been with my partner for 10years If we can have a healthy pregnancy We want to. But there’s a lot of pressure with this medication
175914314,It’s soooo nice to be around people who have had similar experiences. Thinking ur the only one is scary
175914315,It’s definitely the depressive part of sza that hits me the hardest. The thing that gets me is the doc always wants to hear what my trigger was before I get depressed. Drives me nuts that usually there isn’t a trigger. People assume I’m just an unhappy person but that’s not true. I admit when I feel the depression in a physical manner then I may ruminate on negative thoughts. Oh well.
175914316,"I really like yours. I think it is just practice, patience and focus. Keep at it and you’ll see improvement if its something you want to do. You could try drawing the things around you and add as much detail as you can, thats how i started out"
175914317,"Nope, never tried DBT. I'm doing regular talk therapy and EMDR currently. Neither of them seem to be doing much good. But that's probably the depression talking. I just let an IRL friend know that I'm sui and stuff so that's good. The more open about it I can be IRL and not just online I think the better. I'm not very open but I'm trying to be."

174332102,"They said"" the initial dopamine hypothesis stated that hyperactive dopaminegic transmission leads to development of schizophrenia symptoms (hallucination,delusion,thought disorder ) What was said is just an unusual beliefs ,because there is no any casual relationship between the dopamine and the existence of sz condition or its symptoms In the case If the dopamine level (or any chemical substance) is corrected /modified to the ideal position by action of medical intervention -during the waking time; This does not prevent symptoms from occurring during that period,even for a period of ONE minute -Even if the level of the whole brain chemistry is corrected to the ideal position during the wakefulness period ,it will not prevent the symptoms (any one) The sleep mechanism is the only one that wipes out the existence of the sz condition and prevent symptoms from occurring throughout sleep hours ,regardless of their number This is the _NAME_ evidence that the brain chemistry is not the existence cause o
f sz condition and not the cause of its symptoms ,because The symptoms precede the chemical alteration and cause-contrary to what the theory says In reality,the occurrence of symptoms and their succession within hours brings about alteration in the dopamine level in the form of quantities,they accumulate one after other after the occurrence of each processes producing a package of symptoms at ones ,the resulting damage can be endured until the alteration reach a specific amount after the passage of nany hours,causing an imbalance that cannot be sustained -damage Increasing the level of dopamine does not create the symptoms and does not cause the biological damage,rather the accumulation of metabolism products of the dopamine (and others) and not to get rid of it with reverse chemical processes or by medical intervention ,is what causes a biological damage without any relation to what happen at the leavel of higher mental processes"
175914340,"I was wondering if I was a narcissist for posting that but it's honest. I looked up ""Covert/introverted narcissist"" and wasn't that and then ""Self aware narcissist"" but it wasn't that either because I have too much empathy. It's impossible to ignore or hurt someone else when you have empathy. You can't ignore empathy - It's like love.. Much stronger than hate if you can feel it. They're opposites. You can't have both at the same time. I'm just autistic. My ex step dad was a narcissist and the biggest piece of **** and is getting his karma. I will get my own karma for self medicating due to his actions - I'll then realize how to cope better as an addict and he'll either keep being a narcissist or become aware before or after he dies. He's never taken a drug in his life. His drug was manipulating other people and pretending to care. It doesn't matter how intelligent you are (Like my mom) - You can still get manipulated. The only way to solve that problem is to learn from your mistakes."

And then we would hang them on our walls like a painting or photograph. She got so good that a small store offered to sell them in their store. And she gave them to friends if they liked them. I have to say though that was in the early seventies when stuff like that was still popular with hippies and ex-hippies. Maybe your therapist would like something like that to hang on his wall in his house or apartment or whatever car he’s living in?"

I worked for 12 years before I got sick and a little while afterwords. working adds a lot of stress and is not healthy for me as I have no time to eat healthy, keep up with house chores, and exercise. also I lose sleep when I have to work. I feel like most of the jobs around here are dependent on people working and employees are replaceable to them. not flexible on hours, not great pay, not enough vacation. I feel used when I work, it doesn’t bring me pride or satisfaction. Im pro union now, so I only really consider jobs where I will have representation, even if its just working at a grocery store. if I were high skilled and compensated well I guess I would feel a little different about work. but im generally not. disability is better with a little side income. much healthier for me mentally and physically."

I think I got a lot of issues. I think schizophrenia/bipolar is not just triggered by the norovirus, but is also caused by faulty immune system (perhaps there is a relation to your gut-brain thing), (funny thing is the norovirus affects the gut), drugs can trigger excess damage in the brain due to release of toxins, and brain acidicy like ammonia…maybe other stuff too. I feel like all these studies are great but are just loose correlations (I call them loose associations) because they haven’t found the root cause. I wish people had some faith in me in what I say.

175914429,"I know these things typically have small groups (this one was 19) but I wish they could get it together and get several big enough trials with the same protocols so that this could be an evidence based treatment and people could get it from their doctors. What drug or tech company is going to fund large enough trials? All of these seem to be small scale university and hospital studies funded with grants. Which isn’t inherently a bad thing, but they need $$ for big studies. Patients’ Post-tDCS WM scores were comparable to healthy controls’ WM scores. That seems really significant even if you have to keep doing the stimulation to maintain it."
175914430,can you get to a hospital
175914431,I thought it did but I’ve begun to wonder myself. I wish someone could outright say that it does or doesn’t. The same with Ap’s. Whether they do or don’t. They are both kind of important for deciding how much Ap’s to take. Whether or not having the minimum effective dose is important or not. It’s pretty important information for making decisions of care and it all seems to be in conflict depending upon which study you read. It’s frustrating.

I’m working hard at it. But like in my other said, I recently went off my meds. When I told her she freaked out. Had panic attacks, told me I didnt care or love her, and now shes checking herself in the hospital. Shes convinced I will leave again. Is this abandonment fear… or …?"

However, few studies have investigated these associations. Here, we examined physical illnesses and medical utilization patterns existing before patients received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. We enrolled a large representative cohort of the general population in Taiwan (N?=?1 000 000) and identified 1969 young patients with a new diagnosis of schizophrenia from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2013. We conducted a nested case-control study based on risk-set sampling. Each case was age-matched and sex-matched with 4 controls selected from the general population. The case and control groups were compared on the basis of various clinical characteristics. Conditional logi
stic regression was used to estimate the magnitude of risk associated with newly diagnosed schizophrenia. Within the 1 year before the schizophrenia diagnosis, the cases were most likely to visit the psychiatry department, followed by internal medicine and family medicine departments. According to multivariate analysis, compared with the controls, the cases had substantially higher risk of physical conditions in the prodromal phase, including hypertension (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]?=?1.93, P?=?.001), other forms of heart disease (aRR?=?2.07, P?"

She was a horrible provider and I’ve mentioned her before. But total of 3 days because even the flushing and benadryl didn’t fix it. GP and _NAME_ and I are just glad it wasn’t permanent.

She has severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder and it’s the only thing that helps to keep her in the “normal zone”. If she misses a dose or is inconsistent with timing then it’s very noticeable and she’s a different person. Also as she’s grown we’ve had to increase her dosage to compensate for her weight gain. The lower dosage won’t be effective and we have to recalibrate with her psychiatrist about every 6-8 months.

She’s Hawaiian and we just make small talk but she’s always friendly and I hadn’t seen her for about a month and I thought she shipped out but today I was working and I glanced up and there she was! And she said ‘Aloha’ and walked over to talk to me. She’s way younger than me, I think she’s in her late twenties but she’s really sweet and easygoing. It made me happy to talk to her!"

Like a lot of it isn’t even aimed at me but people feel the need to be like “haha are you gonna go on a schizophrenic rampage and stab people” And i just SEETHE. like they arent talking to me or about me but I ??????? hate these “jokes” Thank you for all the nice things you said (hugs) I’m glad someone thinks I’m not a freak.

Maintains my happiness better than without taking an AD. I had a question. Would you guys classify thought broadcasting as a delusion? Like I have delusions most, followed by disorganized thinking and hallucinations. I think schizoaffective disorder is a constellation of symptoms. Like they intertwine or something. I might mention this at my next pdoc appt. It’s a ways away tho. How are you guys doing? I haven’t really posted much here in awhile and I apologize. I’ve been busy working my dream job as a security officer. I really like my job. I make $14.50/hour working full time. I do four 10 hour shifts a week usually. It’s a dedicated post at a car dealership. Mostly pretty quiet, you get the occasional trespasser. The other night I was working and listening to the police scanner, and playing my phone game. (Clash of Clans) I wa
s counting how much gold it cost to battle and subtracting that from my winnings to find my more accurate winnings, or profit in gold. As soon as I find the number, and I think to myself, _PERSON_, I think the police unit #266 radioed in and said “266”. At the same time! And there’s a 15 minute delay. Weird, huh? This other time my description was broadcast over the police scanner! It was because I walked close by police/EMS stopping to help someone at a homeless camp. They gave my exact description! Next time there’s an emergency scene off my property, I’ll just stay away I think. It’s not like I’m doing anything illegal. What would you guys do?"
175914553,"When I first got ill, I had four years of prodromal symptoms (anxiety, voices, mood swings, delusions). Then my breakdown at 18 years old. Took three years to stabilize and another two to go into remission and I came off my meds successfully. For five years I had almost no symptoms, just occasional voices. Coped well. Then in 2012 after leaving home, my relapse began. Restarted meds end of 2012. After that it was a cycle of pdocs, more hospital stays, different meds, and episodes. Over the years I became more aware of my psychosis and yet it seemed to get worse. My depression as well. On a mood stabilizer and antidepressant, my mood has improved. On an antipsychotic, my psychosis improved. I’m being weaned off of it though, due to side effect of raised prolactin. And some psychosis returned and now I’m struggling a bit again. My pdoc is trying to stabilize me whilst trying to get my meds sorted. Long story short, I think my illness is getting worse. Because my first period of illness was three 
to five years, and it returned and I’ve had nine years of illness and still can’t come off meds. Will I ever be able to come off meds again? Will my remission come again? Or is it true that the more episodes one has, the more likely the illness gets worse and one has to be on meds for life? How was it in you guys’ situations? I accept if my sza is getting worse, but I hope to still function ok on meds and be there for my husband"

Tonight I have to fast remember not to take any medication or eat breakfast or drink any juice or coffee. I hope I can do this. I have a blood test tomorrow."

175914566,"Can I clarify.? Not my goal to crush your dreams, just don’t want you getting into more debt for something that won’t pay off. You need to calculate what you can make working part time in social media marketing and see whether you can pay off the $14,000 in loans you’ll need to take out to finish the degree. I am personally concerned that if you can’t work part time stocking in a grocery store that you’ll end up with all that debt that is like a year of your current income....school debt is different, it doesn’t go away ever and they can just take it from you if you don’t pay, out of wages or tax refunds I think. Student loan debt is crippling. What I suggested was taking lower cost online classes that get certificates rather than degrees. I’m not sure social media marketing requires a degree right now, there are few places that even offer one. What they care about is number of followers and engagement. I did not say give up on your dreams so much as take a less expensive path. Do c
heap to free learning in places like Lynda and coursera and the other set of courses I gave you. Look for more, you know how to google for YouTube etc. I feel like you want to do school to prove something to someone rather than for the practical reason of getting a job. You could graduate from Harvard and your mom would still have issues with you, that’s not going to resolve with a degree. Also to further clarify if you can get to the point where you can work, school will once again be a reasonable option. So my suggestion was talk to dad and fiancé about school and get a second opinion regarding the debt and your working ability. You don’t have to listen to me but I personally feel you have better cheaper options than school."
175914567,Apathetic depression is the worst. I'd prefer it to just be melancholic sadness where I cry.. _PERSON_ at least I'm productive writing lyrics or poems and can actually feel something. Maybe for you it's the antipsychotics making you feel numb? _PERSON_ has this problem with Haldol.
174332139,"I was diagnosed bipolar now I'm schizoaffective. I hear voices and the like. I have powerful delusions mixed with paranoia and hallucinations that play on each other and create a storm that puts me in the hospital when I have an episode. On a bad day I hear voices that are unrelated to my delusions and I can come back to reality quickly. I have paranoia and sometimes I can recognize it as such. I have delusions or strange ideas about reality and I'm like, that's weird I don't think that's true. I often get these in a normal mood. When I'm stressed they overwhelm me and that becomes an episode. The key to observe is to track your moods and see if you experience psychosis in a normal mood or just when you have extreme depression and extreme mania. If you get it all the time, regardless of mood, then you may have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type."

174332152,I think a schizophrenic can feel happiness. Although I have pondered if they can feel depressed. Because if they were depressed wouldn’t that make them sza?? Maybe I understand it wrong. I’m not sure why you feel sad exactly. I think it could be a lot of your illness though. There are things to be sad about with this illness. However each year the last 5 has improved for me. I hope it improves for you soon. I think it will change for U. I think I take pride in relearning old things with a new adult perspective. I think it’s little things like that that gives me joy a lot. Helping people and having connections. Nature and accomplishing stuff. Realizing you’re not alone in this world so much. That’s how I felt working tonight with my coworkers and it brought me joy. I used to not experience joy. I wish I had a better answer than “getting on the right meds changed it for me”.

(even just to a degree counts) If so, this is pretty indicative that this is indeed, as your doctor says, a result of your anxious state. Once you are finished with your medical tests and have eliminated any physical cause for how you are feeling...it will be time to get to work on an anxiety management plan. I recommend talking to your doctor about a therapy referral...especially since you are looking to avoid taking a daily maintenance Rx. Therapy can help you learn the tools needed to cope with the challenges...both mental and physical that go along with A/P. Keep us updated on your journey, and we'll keep you in support! S.C."

I have periods with symptoms still, in which case i take about 2-3mg as a crisis intervention. For about a week. That happened perhaps 4 times the last year. On such a dose it numbs feelings (fear…), slows my thinking and makes it less associative and it makes me sleep all day. It stops psychosis acutely, but it makes me depressed in return."

My passion is thrillers, though, and I am about halfway through the first in a series (I have already written the second one). Generally, I have no issue finding the drive, but, sometimes, this illness robs my motivation. When that occurs, in order to keep moving forward, I have found it helpful to simply schedule in writing time. So, today, for example, not really feeling it. But, at 7 pm, come hell or hihg water, I will _USER_ID_ for at least 30 minutes and I will write at least one scene in the novel. If I still lack the drive when those two things are finished, then I will put it away. If you read about how spme famous authors work, you will find that a number of them do something similar to this every day. So, maybe try putting it on you rschedult. 30 minutes? 60?

I think I have a credit card for every merchant you can think of. If I don’t have their credit card I just use Pay Pal. I gotta find a cheaper hobby."

175914671,That’s the one. Shame it didn’t work for you. I have been on 6 different AP’s and this one seems to be doing the job. It’s weird how different drugs help different people. My pdoc says in 5 years we should have personalised medicine where they can test your body to see which drugs would be best rather than just guessing and relying on luck.
175914672,_AT_MENTION_ . I’ve heard that if you’re an alcoholic you have to quit all together. Are you an alcoholic?
175914673,"Honestly, that sounds like a line from one of the Hellraiser movies. What I can tell you is that not a single one of the threats my voices made over decades amounted to squat. When I’m not laughing at them I’m ignoring them. I never ever engage with them, they’re just pointless noise and I’m a busy person with better things to do."

175914681,I did manage to make it through the weekend without the hospital even though I was hearing voices telling me to die.
175914682,"IDK man, you listed the positives pretty good. It might be helpful to list the negatives too. I can think of a lot of them. When I got in the long term hospital I thought everybody would help everybody else, like we were all in it together. I couldn’t have been more wrong. There was the cliques of punks, most of the 60 or 70 people in there were homeless, or had been incarcerated. I don’t know how you figure it was less crazy inside. The hospital was in a semi nice area and it wasn’t that violent. But I saw so many people flipping out screaming or yelling. And it was boring as hell for 8 months. IDK. I would never want to go back there again, I don’t care that they cook and serve meals. I don’t care I didn’t have to clean anything or do my own laundry. Just the day to day living sucked in there. Even if you make friends in there you are going to be locked up in close quarters with certain people who don’t like you. Never mind the ordeal of taking a shower in an ice cold room that floo
ded every time you took a shower. And I could go on. I’ve seen other people post this and I think in a way, they romanticize the experience. They make it sound like a vacation where everything goes smoothly and you have no responsibilities. It’s lot harder than that."
175914683,I just played the bass for like 30 minutes. Felt good.

In an ideal world, our meds wouldn’t affect our feelings, but they do. Abilify is better for me (especially on a lower dose) , but I still don’t feel things completely as I do when off them. Risperidone was hell, though."

I don’t have the issue of a mum that doesn’t believe I can’t do things, for me it’s more a case of doing it in a way that appeals to what is normal. This won’t make sense.

175914688,"I dont know… On AP my thinking feels slow and boxed in. I feel i cant access all my thoughts. As if something is disrupting the flow, but i know it is there. Memories feel distant. I find myself a rational robot. Other people find me (as) normal (as i get). My focus is more outside. On very low doses of AP, i like my thinking better. Im more associative, creative, pensative, emotional, my mind feels more like myself. Though im more chaotic, distracted and eccentric…I can still act superficially normal. Without AP and in psychosis…I myself at that time (!) feel my mind is very bright and i finally see things clearly. I can access memories much better and connect things rapidly. It FEELS more clear and organised from inside, but Im pretty sure others would not describe it that way. Nor would i in retrospect."

174332169,Have you had scary symptoms from the meds?I’m on clozapine and haliperdidol. I constantly feel like I’m on a boat and dizziness. Also I feel nauseated and like I’m gonna pass out anytime. I have chest pain also. I’ve been to _NAME_ twice in the last two weeks and they couldn’t find anything wrong. They said it’s the meds. So have you experienced anything like this on the meds? If you did what did u do?
175914696,"i tried that for about 6 months. had no effect on me mentally except i got pretty thin, I likely because I wasnt getting enough calories. I actually had another psychotic episode during this diet period. i basically ate chicken, brown rice, brown rice pasta, chia bread. I did have goats milk because I was told it was more tolerated than regular milk but i didnt eat cheese. i ate salmon everyday. it was tough to eat like that."
175914697,"Flashback to when I first walked in his office. I burst out sobbing. “I dont want to be on Abilify or medications anymore.” “You have Bipolar. You never had schizophrenia.” Still crying. Flash forwards: “You have schizophrenia.” Puts me on anti-depressants because I want to be normal. Anti-depressants cause mania, mood swings, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Is it even worth it anymore to go to a psychiatrist? Like if I have to take Abilify great but one day I’ll have dementia and be blind so I can’t take it forever. I want a freaking alternative. I am so sick of this. My emotions are great right now, it’s out of my system. Next time I cry in the psychiatrist’s office? I’m so done. Screw the scientologists. I am disowning this situation. Money, power, fame, success! Money is the anthem to success. No it aint. In two weeks I’m leaving this forum.

174332174,"_AT_MENTION_ Psychiatrists don’t give antipsychotics for no reason. Refusing meds and treatment are proven parts of schizophrenia itself. Your positive symptoms will persist if they weren’t drug abuse induced. If it was drug induced, you stop the drugs and no more schizophrenia. About 8% of the cases are like that. All the other 92% requires lifetime antipsychotics. I nearly died and nearly killed someone because I stupidly stopped meds. Please don’t tell ppl to stop meds and that psychiatrists prescribe antipsychotics to harm and punish you on a sz forum knowing it can make ppl kill others and commit suicide."

174332178,I too was givens a formal ASD dx or High Functioning Autism dx. _PERSON_’s. Also Sz. I think the ASD manifested first in my aversion to things sensory and then I developed childhood schizophrenia. I was highly “imaginative” but the lines are blurred on what was imaginary and what I was experiencing early on as hallucinations. My first earliest memory of hallucinations was 5 so it’s really debatable but my first sensory aversion was before that and I would freak out and have meltdowns if certain things touched me. To this day I compulsively wash my hands if I get sticky or dirty. I don’t like being touched a lot. I too found a good psychiatrist that listened to my history and made the diagnosis of ASD and Sz. I’m still not 100% on board with the ASD dx but I know for sure about the Sz dx.

So instead of changing meds, I added a new med for my thyroid. My GP did not want me changing too much at one time which is understandable. But I'm so tired of struggling to get through the days. Occasionally I will have a good day or two, then followed by anxiety and crying. It takes weeks to get the thyroid leveled out, and that may not even be my problem. Now I'm having to take klonopin every 2 or 3 days, and am worried about addiction to that. Frankly abilify and cymbalta both scare me. Anyone have any good experiences switching from one ssri to another? My GP suggested prozac.

Now, I KNOW you don’t ever tell people to go off their meds. It’s just by saying something works or will work, a vulnerable, ie “uneducated in natural meds” person may go off their meds and become worse What we want to see from you is more of an…"" I have used this and I believe it may help me"" approach. Or “this may help in addition to meds”"

He told me that his dad told him to enjoy his emotions. He will not understand it right away but will do so eventually. I hang on to those words while riding the roller coaster of emotions… Today I understand what he meant by that. We are human. Emotions is part of being human. I have never in my life experienced such radical emotions as through and after the divorce. The pain was unbearable. It took me years to get over the divorce. Today, 15 years later I know that I don’t want to go through it again and that I’m better off staying single. There is no easy way out of the emotions. Enjoy them cause one day it will make a lot of sense to you."

I had previously been in a different county with more resources in the same area and had a doctor that I considered very helpful. It sucks when the system isn’t giving you the help you need. Are you sure you’ve exhausted all options of looking for the best doctor that’s covered by the county? They gave me the option of switching in the county I used to be in (the helpful one).

The longer they wait to say it, the more disappointing it is. Since I’m never expecting it, I can’t believe the voices are not external.

175914854,"The type of jealousy I’m talking about is fear of being rejected by those that mean a lot to me. I never used to have this to the level I have it now because my psychosis was sort of about that a lot. Also my best friend in childhood rejected me after about 10 years of us hanging. That obviously had a huge impact on me. Thinking about it now, I guess I’m learning that those who actually do matter to me the most are those who I feel won’t reject me. The problem is that I often get a feeling that certain ppl will reject me when it might be imagined but because I imagine it so strongly it affects my behaviour and then I do end up losing those people. My type of jealousy manifests as fear of abandonment and avoidance. What a great topic to bring up, once more. Anyway I think that learning to know who really matters to me is what I am working on now. Doesn’t mean I hate those who reject me. They have their reasons for rejecting me. It’s not like I don’t reject ppl either."

175914866,"Mobbing - Mobbed UK Mobbing is “bullying on steroids,” a horrifying new trend whereby a bully enlists co-workers to collude in a relentless campaign of psychological terror against a hapless target. Targets are usually anyone who is “different” from the organizational norm. Usually victims are competent, educated, resilient, outspoken, challenge the status quo, are more empathic or attractive and tend to be women, aged 32 to 55. Targets also can be racially different or part of a minority group. The target receives ridicule, humiliation, and eventually, removal from the workplace. It leaves the victim reeling with no idea what happened or why. It takes away a person’s safety in the world, dignity, identity and belonging and damages his or her mental and physical health. The effects also radiate outward toward the target’s partner, family, friends and even community. Because an employee is being targeted and criticized, he or she may be seen as a “troublemaker” by others and thus be 
ignored and isolated by otherwise OK people. Former allies can thus turn against him and he is left socially isolated. They think: “well, he’s being criticized by management, there must be something wrong with him and I don’t want to be tarred by the same brush!” Gossip and innuendo spread behind closed doors before the target is aware of what’s happening, as previously loyal co-workers are enlisted to provide personal information that substantiates damaging rumors. Often the person instigating the mobbing is emotionally immature and threatened in some way by the target. People with personality disorders often employed tactics such as “splitting,” which pits members of a team against each other in order to exact revenge against a perceived slight or insult by the target. At least 30 percent of bullying is mobbing — and the tendency is rising. In Australia, a government inquiry revealed that calls about workplace bullying had increased by 70 percent in three years. Statistics show that bullying 
affects one in three employees; what is really worrying is that one in two have witnessed bullying but have done nothing about it. Moreover, the actual incidence of bullying is likely to be much higher: for every case reported, eight to 20 cases are going unreported (_PERSON_, 2012). Mobbing is more likely to occur when a number of workplace factors are present. Understanding what they are can help to protect yourself from staying in, or taking a job in a toxic organization. For example, certain industries facing increased financial pressure because market demand is on the wane are more mobbing-prone. These organizations are driven by the dollar and accountable only to shareholders and directors. This creates toxic environments where managers turn a blind eye to bullying and mobbing and may even encourage it (Duffy & Sperry, 2013). Organizations that are driven by bureaucracy, e.g., government departments, are arguably the most toxic. They appear to have policies and procedures to ensure a safe workplace, but 
they will redefine bullying as a “personality conflict” and end up offering no real protection. In essence, bad behavior is tolerated and left to escalate. The 2012 film, “Murder By Proxy: How America Went Postal” is a fascinating portrayal of the ultimate in toxic workplaces. In contrast, healthy organizations are accountable to a wider range of shareholders including customers, staff and community. They also have values that are centered on caring for others (Duffy & Sperry, 2013). The best way to deal with workplace mobbing is to increase resilience, practice self-care and get out as soon as possible. It is often impossible to win against organizations that tacitly support mobbing. Five steps that you must take to ensure recovery are: Document everything in detail. From the earliest signs of something “not quite right,” even if it’s just a gut feeling, keep a journal of all the incidents you experience. The more evidence you have, the better your recourse to legal action later. Give yourself 
space and time to figure things out. Seek someone in authority you can trust at work to disclose to. Seeking redress from the organisation might not be a safe first step for you to take. See a doctor for stress leave and a worker’s compensation claim. Get a good recovery team to stop the isolation. A good clinical psychologist will help you develop recovery strategies, liaise with your doctor and lawyer, write a psychological injury report and advocate for you. A good lawyer will help you initiate legal action. A good doctor will treat bullying’s medical repercussions. Family and friends will understand, believe and support you. Make self-care a priority.Focus on what you love. Engage in a daily spiritual practice and follow good diet and exercise plans. Engage in meaningful life activities. Set new goals. Undertake creative pursuits. Focus on fun and laughter.

175914873,I feel the same way. We had a psychiatrist come to my house and he diagnosed me based on my past history but he didn’t actually talk to me. My NP thinks I’m sza but my boyfriend sure doesn’t. He wants me to see a psychiatrist he picked out and is paying him 5000 so that I’ll be diagnosed as fine. This sure does confuse me and makes me wonder if the things I’m paranoid about are true. Everyone on this website tells me they are not and so does my family. I know I had command hallucinations to kill myself so this makes me think I could be sza since this is a part of it. What do you think?

If anyone doubts how serious the financial condition is, go to usdebtclock.org. I don’t deserve this money and it’s been stolen from our children. I don’t want to get into politics, but I’ll just say people need to do their research and understand exactly what the Federal Reserve is and how it operates. As for me, I’m going to donate all monies received to a charity that develops therapy dogs for wounded soldiers and those who require a therapy dog for their PTSD.

174332210,"Often there is a good => bad pattern to what my schizophrenia does. First it shows some object/thing/concept in good light, and/or applies good vibes/feelings to it. Then it presents me the same concept again, but turns it into a bad experience by applying unpleasant feelings or vibes to it, and/or telling me (via voices/inserted thoughts) how stupid/bad person I am for having seen that thing as a good thing before. It has done this repeatedly; first creating a good experience out of something, then repeatedly presents me the same thing as a bad thing, and applies bad feelings/vibes to it."

175914890,"It is ****_NAME_. It reminds me of the people on the video chat saying ""I don't mind people working and minding their own business but people on welfare should all be put into a shooting ground like hunger games and killed"". Don't people need meaning instead of working a ****** soul sucking job for society? Wtf is society? billions of people. People think they're so righteous and great like they mean something more than other people because of the way they live or do things. And right now, everyone's losing their jobs. People do jobs that a robot can do. People have value. It's not just money. Money circulates throughout the economy. It doesn't just vanish - Except for the rich and criminals. We know things are bad – worse than bad. They’re crazy. It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don’t go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: ‘Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my 
toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything. Just leave us alone.’ Well, I’m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don’t want you to protest. I don’t want you to riot – I don’t want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write. I don’t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad. (shouting) You’ve got to say: ‘I’m a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!’ Annnndd.. People say ""My taxes are paying for that"" NO. Your taxes pay less than ONE DOLLAR for that ""thing"". It's evenly distributed among everything that taxes pay for. No one has the right to say **** because they vote. Don't vote and you won't be responsible. I'm just mad. I try my hardest to improve myself and I'm not lazy yet the problems I'm dealing with at home makes me not focus and I use substances as a solution - Oh addicts deserv

It was all denied and somehow, I survived. But I am not well, now and remembering and am very unable and afraid of people. My Dad is gone now, I know. And it helps some to know that. But I have hurt people in the name of getting even with my Dad, never knowing that that was why. So I am left with feeling I am a bad person on top of trying to heal the injury."

That usually makes the authorities take the situation more seriously."

I dont think i’m explaining it very well. do you think you are reaching your full potential?"

My bosses are quite supportive as we get the difficult customers sometimes! How many hours do you work/week? If you really want to have face to face work with disabled or dementia clients you could volunteer, say once a fortnight or month. If you can afford to time-wise & financially. There’s always a big demand for kindly people in those volunteer positions. I volunteered once a week for a year recently. I cooked hot lunches for mentally unwell people living in supported accommodation. I learnt a lot on many levels. My bosses there was awesome."

It’s lie their complacent in it all? I feel totally alone and have nobody on my side."
175914911,"Hi, I'm new here, and I realise this is an old post, but to _NAME_. You have described my symptoms to a tee. Like you, I have had my heart checked, and am now on beta blockers for over 21,000 ectopic beats in 24 hrs. They have made little difference. My heart feels like there is a motor running in it, when I get these dizzy spells, it's beating so fast. Like you I can see my body shaking with the racing. Although extra heartbeats were picked up on 24 - 48hr ecgs, they were over the 24-48hr period. Nothing extra was picked up when these episodes occurred, so I have been told that these particular episodes are not heart related. I'm not entirely convinced this is right, because I know my heart is sped up, and thumping, so why isn't the ecg picking this up? I also know at around the same time, my BP drops very low (74/45), and my heart rate strangely according to my pulsometer, actually dips down low (40's) when it feels like it's racing. Whether this is the cause I don't know, but I wish I knew what 
was causing that as well. Nobody seems to have any answers for me, other than looking at me as if I'm making it all up. It's miserable. I find these episodes are worse still if I fall asleep in a chair. It makes me panic, but I don't think panic started it, I panic BECAUSE of it. I don't know which way up I am at times, because i'm so dizzy. The trouble is, the more you are brushed aside as if it's nothing, the more anxious you get. So if you wasn't anxious when it first started, you soon become anxious afterwards. I do suffer from depression and anxiety due to severe health problems in my husband and daughter, so know it's there. However, I've had counselling, CBT, am on 2 different anti depressants, and still it happens. I am lost. I wonder if you have had a diagnosis yet? I would be interested to hear. I've not heard anyone describe exactly the same as me until now. I am relieved I'm not alone in this, but sorry some-one else has to suffer with this. It's debilitating."

It is also used to target individuals remotely – through intimidation and harassment. On the 28th of February in _NAME_, Professor _PERSON_, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel Inhuman Degrading Treatment and Punishment, has officially confirmed that cyber torture exists and investigation is now underway on how to tackle it legally. Electromagnetic radiation, radar, and surveillance technology are used to transfer sounds and thoughts into people’s brain. UN started their investigation after receiving thousands of testimonies from so-called “targeted individuals” (TIs). Professor _PERSON_ is an expert in international law and since 2016 he holds the Human Rights Chair at the _NAME_ Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights. His team has found evidence that Cyber technology is used to inflic
t severe mental and physical sufferings. “Judges think that physical torture is more serious than cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,” he told the Guardian on 21 February. “Torture is simply the deliberate instrumentalization of pain and suffering.” These psychological torture methods are often used “to circumvent the ban on torture because they don’t leave any visible marks”. (1) Cyber psychological systems like cognitive radio are used to interrupt human perceptions and memory. They can also be used to spy on people violating personal integrity which could lead to corruption and slavery in society. Cyber torture is also called no-touch torture or brain-machine interface.

The evidence gathered could then be used to convict criminals easier and quicker in the future. Professor _PERSON_ and his team are now underway to create an international legal framewor

The United Nations Begins its Investigation into ""Cybertorture!"" Tuesday, March 10, 2020 Greetings, everyone. Incredible news! Some thought they would never live to see the day that someone would investigate our claims, however that day has arrived and an investigation into our issues is now underway by the United Nations! I've just now received the above news from _NAME_ who has been in constant contact with _PERSON_ as he represented the TI community recently in _NAME_, Switzerland for the most recent session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which began on the 24th of February and runs through March 20. _PERSON_ who has recently met privately with the UN Ra
pporteur on Torture, _PERSON_, is in constant consultation with him as Mr. _PERSON_ team of lawyers and investigators begin their work of investigating organized stalking and electronic harassment - now termed ""cybertorture."" ""Cyber"" is in reference to 'cybernetics' which studies the interconnection between computers and living organisms, hence the term, 'cybertorture,' which fits perfectly and efficiently with all that is happening to members of our community in my opinion. _PERSON_ has suffered horribly himself with life-threatening attacks on many occasions for years due to the abuse of remote torture technologies,and is now in the process of assembling a team of consultants from the United States and elsewhere as he shuttles information to the UN Rapporteur and his investigators to assist them in their work. _NAME_ who was a key player in bringing all this together plans to join us this Saturday at our Saturday Night Podcast to discuss the latest developments and answer your questions as the UN invest

175914919,"I have been offered an interview for a water utilities company that is at the end of my road. The pay is much better and I would get the next level of promotion I would be getting where I work now. There is also 8 hours less commute a week. The problem is I don’t cope well with change, and I am very comfortable where I work currently. I have my mother, aunt and two cousins where I work now, and they help me a lot. I also have a four day week which helps me. I would lose flexible working. We also have casual dress and I can smoke pretty much enough to see the day out. I really don’t know what to do. I guess I cannot stay in the same job forever, so this seems like a leap of faith I may have to take."
175914920,Fasting is good for health. I’ve skipped meals like breakfast or dinner before but I don’t think it helped me much or at all.
175914921,look up the definition of enlightenment
174332207,But fat has like 3x more calories/g than carbs and protein. My only problem is that I stay in bed all day. When I used to go to the gym on Abilify I was eating more than now and was 200lb. To lose weight now I have to eat close to nothing.
175914922,"I’m being serious because _AT_MENTION_ wrote this… I have had suspicion that I am gay since I was 17, but this coincided with my psychosis."
175914923,"I also love how psychiatrists say like, ""oh just take this little pill and everything'll be fine,"" when in reality it's more like ""your life is going to change significantly after taking this little pill and probably won't be the same ever again."" I'm not dissing meds, but I'm just saying that reality has really caught up with me this time. I don't like when people think meds are a quick fix to mental health issues. Of course, they happen to be the best treatment, say some people. But it's really about a whole lot more than that, I think. And I am still figuring out that stuff."
175914924,It is always something. Ugh. I had a hard time swallowing when I was on a couple different meds. For me it was Invega and Seroquel.

175914931,I thought that there were aliens half human reptiles in control I knew them as the illuminati.They were fascist and fighting for control of every organisation like the doctors surgery and the mental facility I was in.They needed human blood and would have transfusions at the gp surgeries when they were shut to human patients.I thought everyone communicated telepathically and could read minds as could I.I thought specific delusions about my sister and brother in law that they were separated and getting divorced when they weren't! I thought the walls and ceilings and rooms in the mental facility that I was in were shinking this wasn't helped by some of the rooms being really small and the doctors in them being six foot tall.My delusion was that unless I paced around the building continuously in a circle the whole building would continue to shrink.Then there was the delusion that the fascists has ceased control of the country.Very frightening!
175914932,I have the same problem now and It’s difficult to ignore what I think because I’m sure it could happen and this makes me really anxious all the time. I feel trapped.

175914938,I quit my job. Too much anxiety for a 10 hour shift. Need to get my mental health right before I hold a job.
174332221,I prefer to call it a “condition” as opposed to an illness or a disorder. It quite clearly was adaptive in the past in some form but is no longer necessary for survival. Imo. (In my opinion).

175914941,Do you have a crisis stabilization unit? I know a few people who stayed there until they found a place and the staff helps.
175914942,"Psychotic symptoms will most often decrease gradually. When a medication works it is not my experience that you can point to a particular day and say ‘that’s when I was all better’. It is more similar to how a storm at sea ends. Waves become smaller, they no longer make foam, but it is hard to tell when the storm ended."
175914943,"You also mentioned in the opening post the connection to dissolution of minimal self. In the literature, minimal self is defined quite strictly: it is the awareness of it being you who experiences some content. There has been debate whether, for example, intrusive/inserted thought lack this, but it seems to be established that since there is no question of who is experiencing such thoughts, minimal self should be thought to be preserved in such occurrences. I would say that the same holds for the - indeed more radical - experiences mentioned in this topic. For instance, you seem to leave no doubt that it was you who was experiencing this kind of ego-death. This is just enough for minimal self to be preserved. In fact, I would think minimal self is so robustly defined such that I doubt whether the notion of experience can be appealed to without minimal self."
175914944,To live till I’m 90.
174332217,I think what adds weight to this is that female psychosis/schizophrenia can worsen when woman are post menopausal. One barrier to using it in men might be side effects. Although it might be because of use in trans women there are already good guidelines regarding that.
174332215,"I would like to mention that I think dark matter is matter/gravity coming from a parallel universe, dark energy is energy/electricity/gravity coming from a parallel universe, and schizophrenia’s root cause is caused by a virus called the Norovirus. I think these things are true. I guess I’m delusional, but I think I will be proven right. I’m not sure about dark energy/dark matter because I never studied it but I think in a past life, _PERSON_ told me something about dark energy/dark matter is what we call matter or gravity (not sure which) coming from an invisible/undetectable parallel universe. I don’t know why I remember these things. I barely do – that’s why I’m confused but I think I got the jist of it! I also believe this stuff has to do with electricity or the matrix and thus almost everything or everything has to do with quantum electricity, despite not knowing this stuff personally. (I’m pretty sure I used to be an amateur quantum physicist in a past life). Regarding schizop
hrenia, I’m getting visions of news articles about it being caused by the norovirus and that it’s about time to be cured in 1-2 years – I think with the vaccine. I don’t know if the damage is irreversible or if we’ll all be cured. But I have a hunch _NAME_ (me in a past life) left a clue saying it’s in the food or something and uncleanliness because I never had dementia/_PERSON_’s (really, naturally) but permanently schizophrenic and I’m just interested in curing it for others but especially myself. I also think someone told me this while I was ‘dreaming’ which could be real or something (I know we can’t talk about aliens – so I’ll shut up now/again). I don’t know why some people get sick from the virus but I think if I’m proven right, I should get some sort of recognition or money because I hate being poor and the worst thing is having no motivation in life. I’m posting this for the ‘others’ and the future of humanity and that I can leave a record of my thoughts and stuff 
so I can get help and help others and show proof that I proved these things. Thank You and thank you for your time!"

174332213,They can make them worse. My doctor took me off seroquel specifically for that reason and tried another AP on me.
175914952,Please send me a message if you can make people hear voices. So you can make people hear voices?
175914953,"Sometimes the voices seem to literally control my body. They would say something like “We’re now going to flap your arms like wings, and jump up and down” and that indeed happens. There is nothing I can do. I don’t think that the voices directly control my body though. I assume there’s a process running behind all that, and that process is controlling both the voices and my body. It would explain the strange behaviour of my body, that sometimes happens even if voices do not tell in advance what’s going to happen ."
175914954,No. The whole world can see those results. Google does not discriminate.

174332227,"I’m 44, but have always been “weird”. I had unusual beliefs when very young. I also had a traumatic upbringing, but only one instance of abuse. It was all family drama and some unintended mental abuse from my bipolar or possibly schizoaffective mother. But yeah, I was young when I experienced both positive and negative symptoms. I think it is more common than we know about. Not all people remember their childhood or teens vividly. I was originally diagnosed schizoaffective at 15. They used a different name, I dont5remember it now, but my new psychiatrist was able to track down my records and I can ask him."
175914960,sorry you feel that way
175914961,"Wow. Similar to what I’m experiencing. I think maybe I should try another medication, then maybe this stuff will go away."

174332231,"Found another text file (from October 2017) with notes describing strange things happening. The memory gap I have covers that period, so I don’t remember any of it. “Somebody/something was selecting things with my finger on the touchpad, in a mindless state.” That indicates my mind at that time was temporarily “turned off” (the notes come from the time when I apparently still had thoughts). Does that mean my thoughts have an on/off switch? I am currently in a mindless state (haven’t got a single thought as long as I remember having my schizophrenia). Another line referring to a “mindless state” from the same file: “Mindless state, can’t remember or think about things I want to recall/think about.” Several mentions of “something/somebody” controlling/messing with my body. 4 occasions of something messing with my focus, or ordering me to focus on things (“external objects”, “eyes that were changing from evil to good repeately”, “a mental focal point”). “The rea
lity turned into a dream-like state (like a lucid dream).” “According to one theory the plan is to mix together 2 souls or spirits” My body can act normally and abnormally at the same time. For example it can continue typing with 1 hand on the keyboard, while the “spirit” is messing (shaking, etc.) with the other hand. This happened right now, as if it wanted to prove it can do it. Maybe the plan succeeded."

175914999,"Hi _PERSON_! Welcome to the forum! As someone who also has IBD I understand what you are going through. I suggest you take your concerns to your doctors and have this discussion. There are other meds but every one is different in what works for them. Buspar and Zoloft are what worked for me. How is your colitis, is it active? Have you been checked for anemia( this can contribute to the high heart rate too)? IBD frequently goes hand in hand with anxiety and depression so getting the right meds for the colitis may make a big difference with the anxiety too. I saw a big impact in the past when I was finally in remission."

I also mentioned to her about failing to get clarity about something from a doctor and started getting worked up (which is uncommon for me to do with her) because it seemed like she was kind of dismissing me - to which she further dismissed me as we got off the phone. Then she emailed me saying she got me a psychiatrist appointment for September, when usually with mine it be about a year wait, so I was appreciative that it was just me she was dismissing rather than my issues. I'm going to want my shrink to switch me to something other than lithium, I think. I can't understand social and conversational cues from over the phone; it's disorienting and really ineffective for me to do important interactions that way. I'm going to have to make sure I talk calmly and normal paced with her, so I don't cause myself to be misinterprete

I can fake being confident in public but I have a pre-planned conversation in my head and if it doesn’t go to plan I get worried I made myself look stupid in front of people and I catastrophize about how I looked stupid. this will stop be going out in public for days and days.

But I would rather have that and be able to function and get projects done than to not take the medicine and basically have the emotional problems I was having and able to get very little done. You say, “You said, “Since I am a problem solver driven to find answers, Accepting my health to “just be that way” Is hard for me to accept.” Yes, that is difficult. I’ve been through some of those myself. Is there anyway you could lessen the amount of anti-anxiety medicine that you took before which would help with your anxiety, but allow you to get things done?

175915073,I don’t know now I’m having second doubts about going back on Abilify. I wasn’t that stable while I was on it but I was also taking Tegretol. I remember becoming more stable on this drug as time went by. Maybe at higher doses. I can certainly try it out again and see how I do. But man it made me very anxious to the point I became paranoid. I was able to lose over 60 pounds on this drug while following a low carb diet. But yeah weight loss was possible. I’m managing to lose some weight now but not enough. I’m stuck at the 199 lb mark. I can’t seem to go lower no matter how much I diet. I’ll see what my doctor thinks about me switching APs. I’ve been pretty stable on Risperdal all these years.

This world always feels so far away when I’m home, and when I’m in this world I long for home. I’ve visited that place many times, it was given to me by a close friend and guardian. I killed myself twice, overdose, heart stopped, brought back again and again. After some trials I was given a place to rest, maybe a realm to play in. A pleasant reward for crawling to hell and back. An eternal home while I wait for the next episode of adventures. What do you say to a kid who believes they are divine? What happens when a grandson hears angels, and she believed him? Saying I’m a madman makes it easier for them, I don’t know if they could handle it. I know its better to keep it a

If taking the definition from Wikipedia… Psychosis is an abnormal condition of the mind that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not … it may be either true or false, that I’m psychotic. Given that it appears to me that my body is moving by itself, it is impossible to tell if it’s me doing things, or something else.

175915101,Shrimp presumptions Scientists have discovered that the Mantis shrimp - from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia - can actually process 4 times as many primary colors as people can. This is made possible because their eyes operate almost perfectly across the entire visible light spectrum - from near ultra-violet to infra-red. Researchers are unclear why such a rarified vision is needed by the shrimp… but they suspect it has something to do with food and sex. Which is kinda insulting to these special little crustaceans.

Since then, I’ve learned so much about who I am, and how to love myself. I’ve learned how to be a good friend and partner to the people I love.

Among 20 patients with schizophrenia who received conventional rehabilitation, 10 patients were allocated to an experimental group and they additionally performed the program to improve grocery shopping skill in a real situation for eight sessions.

There is strong science that shows it raises zonulin levels, which in turn weakens the intestinal wall and blood-brain barrier. The healthiest people are the ones whose bodies heal that damage daily, but some people are just under too much stress that they can’t bounce back from that daily onslaught, and they end up in a net deterioration state, and mental illness shortly follows. "" One of the first hints that these circumstances could have implications for the psychological sciences was the observation that, in several countries, hospitalization rates for schizophrenia during World War II dropped in direct proportion to wheat shortages.""

I was no longer psychotic but either the meds or the underlying illness had changed me. Suddenly I had cognitive problems with working memory, processing speed and adhd when I had always had extreme focus. I personally believe it was the adhd causing the jumping behavior. Like every other day I’d change what I wanted to be now that I needed to search for a brand new career. Basically as soon as things became hard I bailed. They won’t give me a stimulant so I tried fish oil....it worked and got rid of this. Since then I got an IT cert and am working on my masters.....I’m not jumping between prospective careers anymore.

Five hundred sixteen patients (65.1% men) with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were evaluated in four centres of the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Catalonia). Psychopathological assessment was performed using different PANSS factors. Insight and its three main dimensions were assessed by means of the Scale of Unawareness of Mental Disorder: awareness of the disease (SUMD-1), of the effect of medication (SUMD-2) and of the social consequences of the disease (SUMD-3). Structural equation models (SEMs) were used to fix the mo
del in the total sample and by gender. Additional analyses included age, duration of illness (DOI) and education status (ES). There were no significant differences between men and women in the three main dimensions of insight. The SEMs in the total sample showed a modest fitting capacity. Fitting improved after a gender-stratified analysis (particularly in women). In men, positive and excited symptoms were associated with poorer insight in all SUMD dimensions, whereas depressive symptoms were associated with better insight. ES in men was also associated with better SUMD-2 or SUMD-3. In contrast, in women, symptoms did not have a negative effect on SUMD-1 or SUMD-2. However, positive symptoms were associated with a poorer SUMD-3, whereas depressive symptoms were associated with better SUMD-3. Moreover, education level was also associated with a better SUMD-3. A gender approach improved the comprehension of the model, supporting the relevance of gender analysis in the study of insight."

So I walk into the employment centre and this same guy I feel like he's judging me. He did nothing wrong. Said nothing wrong. I just don't like him. So I make an appointment and walk to the gas station. I needed to blow my nose and I wait for of course someone to be in the washroom already but there wasn't. I buy my bottle of coke and don't want to interact with the cashier woman. She did nothing wrong. I just felt like she was judging me for me being in a bad mood. I walk home, cars driving everywhere judging me walking and then there's people I know and I don't want to say ""Hi"" to them and smile because I'm scared of them and don't want to feel fake."

175915342,"I’m taking Prozac and have been improving slowly. I don’t feel exactly happy but I feel less impulsive and I have zero addictive cravings. I think this is helping me, but I’m still scared to keep taking it because of how it impacted my mom. My mom attempted suicide on Prozac. It’s the only anti-depressant so far that has had any good impact on me. I couldn’t take Wellbutrin because it made my ears ring loudly and it didn’t do anything etc. and I’ve tried just about all the antidepressants from SNRI’s to SSRI’s like Lexapro. Lexapro made me anxious and manic. So prozac at this dose is working pretty well. Not as much as I wish it would. But the start of it I was a wreck. Also I can’t drink wine on Prozac it seems to make me much more tired if I drink anything. I started it about three weeks ago I think. It’s just now starting to have a positive impact. I just have to limit my caffeine, and smoke less cigarettes, and get regular sleep or I feel off. I don’t think it’s really 
helping with depression so much, but it’s helping in other areas of my life. It may be helping balance me out more. It’s like where I used to be more reckless I feel like I’m thinking more carefully and thinking through more of what’s happening. My mom said she thinks its helping me a ton. That I seem more level-headed and happier. I’m really glad I found something that works for me. Isolation and boredom is getting to me right now, and I had trouble sleeping…I’m about to make some coffee. I wonder if I’ll ever be able to move forward without having to take pills but for now I’m going to try and keep taking them as scheduled or I’ll mess up the progress. I wish I could cry right now, I’m sad af for no reason and I should be happy. Man they need to come up with some better happy pills."

175915344,"jaradical: Yes, those two descriptions of panic attacks sound very familiar. Mine started when I was dxed as depressed by a non-speaking (aren't they all?) psychiatrist who simply listened to what I said for 45 minutes, and didn't bother to ask, do you ever have a racing mind, to see if I was manic-depressed. So, giving me an anti-depressant only, sent my depression into mania, and then panic attacks. When I was, years later, given a stabilizer (Lithium in my case) to treat the mania and slow down the anti-depressant, I never had another panic attack. When and how did your panic attacks start? You aren't actually bipolar (racing mind) who is only on an anti-depressant? I think a lot of the anti-depressants treat panic attacks, if you aren't bipolar. You asked, ""Have you had any relief or success with any treatments or grounding techniques?"" The only treatment that works for me is medicine."
175915345,"I love you too sweetie. Thanks for the encouragement, everyone"
175915346,All I can really say is that try not to let your fears take over otherwise it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. I have found that being worried compounds how you’re feeling on med changes - I have had 6 of them so far.

Mostly I don’t notice them Or if I do I just ignore But sometimes it seems They wish to interact They are more ominous And they jump out From behind the door Startling me into heartracing anxiety Peer out at me With curled lips and Bared teeth I sit silently, tv faint Hoping this will end well And as fast as they appear They fade into the sunlight Another day has begun.

You can only offer them support and help them a certain amount. However, if they are not willing or want to get help, there is not much we can do. The person must be willing to receive help and our support. Different medications, dosage and combinations work differently for everyone.

174332340,Clozapine maybe because it’s really sedating. Certain antipsychotics can cause akathisia for a lot of people. I’m pretty sure when they gave me clozapine they took away my clonazapem because they didn’t mix or I didn’t have anxiety anymore. Honestly abilify helps my anxiety. Some people report way differently. Prolixin gave me the worst anxiety for example. But everyone must be different. But some meds are more prone to cause anxiety. They give other meds to balance it out often

My college experience has been nothing, but joy for me, but at the same time there are people in my life missing all my milestones. I lost my biological father at age 3 and my mom at age 10. I was very young and didn't quite understand what was going on. I realized now that, I was too young to understand my father's loss, but my mom's death was more heartbreaking. Now that I'm older, I see all of these families that look so perfect and happy and I miss moments like that. It's tough working at a daycare seeing parents drop off their kids and picking them up at the end of their workday. It's very bittersweet. I enjoy what I do for my part-time job, but some days are harder than others."

Participants were 101 unemployed individuals with schizophrenia living in the community and 67 employed ones.

This is what helped me, everyone is diff though: i tell the ‘audience’ it’s unconstitutional, regardless if they r the gov. i repeat “i am a human with constitutional rights” in my head like a mantra. i periodically vent to someone i can trust about my paranoid delusions. i listen to them tell me it is not happening and i try to let their words calm me. i really try to believe my mom, for example, when she tells me it’s just 
my illness. –i take the antipsychotics– hopefully, you are on meds, it took me like 4-6 months to adjust, stop hearing things/delusions, etc… I still have an ‘echo’ of delusions about cameras, but now i can ground myself to reality by asserting that i am a human with rights.

175915527,"Yes. I changed from Haldol to Zyprexa almost 11 weeks ago. On Haldol, I was in a zombie state all the time and spent 18 hours a day in bed. I was severely constipated all the time, had problems with drooling, and had brain fog. Even though I was on an AP, I had disabling paranoia and delusions. My pdoc decided I didn’t have good quality of life, so she changed me to Zyprexa. The only side effects I get on Zyprexa actually improve my quality of life. It gives me insomnia, so I take it in the morning so I’m alert all day instead of always sleeping. Taking 6 mg of Melatonin helps me to get to sleep with no problem. Zyprexa curbs my appetite, so I can easily stick to a 1200-1400 calorie diet. I do still have constipation if I don’t take Citrucel caplets at dinner time, but now that’s easily managed. As long as I take it, I have no problems. Those are the only side effects I’m experiencing. I have definitely had a successful med change. I encourage anyone who is struggling despite being on med
s to be open with their pdocs so a positive change can be made. Zyprexa is my fourth AP, but it was worth the inconvenience of med changing. It’s my miracle drug. I’m not saying it’s the right med for everyone, but it’s worth working with a pdoc to find the right med for you."

Furthermore, i believe I ran some aspects of the sim, which is hard to believe, i admit. With lost, that was part fantasy. I heard some say it was about montauj project, which i believe. I even believed I had a role in creating the show, which even for me I have doubts because its so great and popular. I dont expect you to believe me. Nothing I will say will change that. I dont want to argue. With q, titor, and _USER_ID_ they are a mystery. No one knows who they are. My guess is quantum computers, time travel, parallel universes, and aliens…but thats just me.

I believe we live in the matrix because I’ve seen it and escaped. I believe some TV shows are part of soft disclosure. I left Illuminati because I was forced to, lucky, found Jesus, and realized Satan runs it. I dont know what else to say. I believe we live in a computer program.

174332369,"Abstract> Eye movements are indispensable for the collection of visual information in everyday life. Many findings regarding the neural basis of eye movements have been accumulated from neurophysiological and psychophysical studies. In the field of psychiatry, studies on eye movement characteristics in mental illnesses have been conducted since the early 1900s. Participants with schizophrenia are known to have characteristic eye movements during smooth pursuit, saccade control, and visual search. Recently, studies evaluating eye movement characteristics as biomarkers for schizophrenia have attracted considerable attention. In this article, we review the neurophysiological basis of eye movement control and eye movement characteristics in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we discuss the prospects for eye movements as biomarkers for mental illnesses. https://onlinelibrary._NAME_.com/doi/full/10.1002/npr2.12087"
175915541,So my medication is causing sexual dysfunction was wondering if there was alternative antipsychotics that dont cause this I can suggest to my doctor
175915542,i have insight for real. its not a delusion love. i dont need medication im enlightened
175915543,Maybe try to work on that a bit. Maybe see what kind of purpose you could find or things that make you feel like your doing something positive. I kind of went a different route and decided to not care about my purpose but to just look at life as a series of experiences both good and bad and to just make the most of each day. So maybe work on your mindset a bit. If that doesnt help then maybe see your pdoc about it

175915553,"My oldest has it, he prefers animals over people unless he can find his people. Weird phrasing, but he made a good group of misfit friends, only a couple are girls as he has female oriented ODD. But since he’s been off meds of all kinds, he’s been way better. It seems to have started when SD school forced us to put him on ADHD meds and bipolar meds, they really messed him up and he quit them before school started last year when he entered high school. His improvements are great. Of course we also had to deal with the female therapist that wanted him to date her. He was 16 and she was 26 with a 5 year old and divorced. It’s been a rough ride. But she has been dealt with, he does no therapy, he’s got “the gang” in life from school and half of them are part of the Xbox “gang” that he is doing the best with. And we also told him that he can have reactions to anything, so anger has gone down since we basically told him you can do what you want say what you want as long as it’s not ille
gal or will get someone hurt. Also us being in WI he’s allowed to drink within the house, 1 wine cooler. He doesn’t have a license and only goes for walks when it’s not satan’s balls hot here. He knows the drinking is only weekends once school starts again. That’s our agreement, I also told him how bad I drank as a kid and what almost happened, and friends are not allowed over to drink ever."

Yes I do think the frontal lobe areas of the brain are where the lesion load may be in schizophrenia, something I read about before, so I have many lesions on my right frontal lobe which is why i may be having my symptoms. As a child I was very hyperactive. I dont have memories much of my younger childhood , maybe back as far as 6 as well but nothing I can remember about being watched like now. Now it’s just suspiciousnes, and I think my neighbor’s can read my mind , are watching me. I had bad traumas growing up so maybe that’s all playing a part as well in my illness.

175915616,"My first response when I read this was ocd is a survival tool we use because of a wound, or multiple wounds from past. We over justify our reasons for our behaviors, ( to ourselves or to others) to make sense of them, in an attempt to keep doing the behaviors so we can be safe or in control. I also experience how our physical bodies can take over and run the show, to force us to lay low, rest, relax, eat better, etc. It feels complex when there’s more layers involved. I tend to want to simplify things first. Look at ways I can delve into old wounds with a therapist so I can work on chronic OCD and see an acupuncturist or naturopath for thyroid questions. The anxiety you experience might dissolve or at least decrease when you are tending to it, and in the very least you’ll learn some tools to support you.

I was exhibiting symptoms as early as 5 years old but it wasn’t until I was 13 that my mom took me to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with manic-depression.She said he didn’t tell her what was going on. I was hospitalized. I was later hospitalized again at 14 and spent my 15th birthday and a month psychotic in Milledgeville. They put me on Haldol, cogetin, Effexor. They increased my seizure meds too. I was a walking zombie. I have been in an out of hospitals for years. I was later diagnosed with Aspergers, possible Schizoaffective and then when I was finally not scared to talk anymore about my symptoms (because I seen how it was affecting my relationships-I’m married now) and I opened up about the hallucinations and delusions/paranoia - I received my Sz diagnosis. I always knew deep down the manic depression/bi-polar diagnosis was wrong but wanted to believe m
y doctors. How can this happen? A New foreign doctor- language barrier coupled with my inability to communicate my illness properly and no one with me at my appointments. I took lithium, abilify, Wellbutrin (Haldol, Respiridone) and anti-anxiety drugs for years. It’s only taken 34 years of hallucinations, delusions, feeling watched, paranoid, disorganized speech, horrible side effects and wrong medications, suicidal ideation, no clarity about my illness and poor social/coping skills to see the truth about it all. I also have Complex PTSD from trauma. I take Geodon now and nothing else. I still have positive symptoms but my now different psychiatrist feels I have my disease in a better manageable place. I’m unresponsive to anti-depressants and certain ones make me act manic. Otherwise I don’t experience mania.

175915670,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , im doing better thanks, woke up in a terrible mood, had a bad craving, took a nap, and now there is no craving. Good advices _AT_MENTION_ especially the one about visualize yourself drinking and see the consequences. Luckily im off drugs, it most have been a struggle for you to fight both alcoholism and drug abuse. Good you are sober and clean now. I don’t know about joining AA - im not good at clubs or group therapy, organizations, but i will give it a thought. _AT_MENTION_ i have not much will power myself, when it comes to alcohol. Thats the reason im on antabus (disulfiram) But i wanna get of antabus and hope my willpower will grow. _AT_MENTION_ two years, i hope it last less in my case. You don’t seem to be bored or unhappy, so i guess sobriety is worth it."

175915675,I actually do! I also tap my feet a lot when I touch my dog because it makes me so happy! I didn’t talk about this stuff at all on this forum because I thought it was my “dirty secret” and it was kinda like me lacking social abilities…so eh. But no use hiding it now. How are you feeling?

175915679,I had many years with no laughter .ever. I could not laugh. Never once laughed for years. How sad to never ever laugh. Not once a year.never. Now I can laugh but I don’t laugh often or easily but I’m so grateful I can laugh. I don’t laugh near as much as a normal person but it happens which it never used to. I was diagnosed with flat effect and I had it but it’s better now.

175915684,"I didn't have withdrawal effects with the SSRI's. But I did with the SNRI Effexor. That was when I tried to go cold turkey. But I took it after and switched to Pristiq with no problem. Just had to go slow. I took Effexor twice. The second time was over 15 years long. The first time I went off of it, I didn't think I needed it. When I went off, I realized I did need it and that it was working. I can see where it is frustrating. I am glad you are going to stay with the 50mg for awhile. Give it a chance. If you haven't had much side effects by now, you may not get anymore. I hope not. Zoloft helped my mood, I just couldn't tolerate the severe diarrhea. Have you ever tried melatonin for sleep? My husband takes it and it helps. I do meditation until I fall asleep. Lately it has been harder but usually I am asleep within 15 minutes. I wonder if it would help you? Not being able to sleep well really effects how we feel during the day. I took buspar and it didn't do anything. My doctor also said at that ti
me that she didn't have much luck with it. Not many of her patients responded well. Were you mentioning about trying to cut it in half and take a morning and evening dose or was that another thread altogether? It sounds like a good idea. It could help with the sleep and morning agitation. I hope that it does. I hope you have a good rest of the day. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175915686,Have you ever read atomic habits...it basically about starting a new routine very slowly... I agree a vacation can do wonders but if you can’t do it right now what can you do instead? Is there anything else that would fill some of that void?
175915687,Ok. The thing is I already called him in the morning. Now it’s afternoon. Should i call tonight or tomorrow?

175915694,I suffered from something like this for a year right after I got sick. I also had symbols or motions I’d make with my hands. It was similar to _PERSON_’s syndrome in that it just popped out. For me it went away with time and medicinal treatment. Are you seeing a psychiatrist and taking antipsychotics?

Since then it all went downhill. I have been sick long time but i managed to work a bit till i couldn’t anymore.
175915719,Maybe when you join the religious community of your belief is a start. But you can be spiritual at home. I think you should talk to someone spiritual. I talked to the priest at the hospital. In theory you can search your answers to your questions on the internet.

This is the case then I came to the realization that mood never come and I need to force myself to do anything even eating food, drinking water. Even to sleep at night. Did you get mood if you force to do some activity like for example you have no mood now to play games. Now if you force yourself to play some game then after few minutes you find yourself hard to stop playing? Any experience like that? For me its like this."

I had one episode of it tonight lasted for like an hour and a half. I don’t know what triggered it but it was just sudden. I experience it as all of a sudden my hair stands on end and my body just gets weird shivers, and I feel like everything is jumping out at me. Just super high vigilance. Like I’ll notice every little shadow or movement as if it is an attack. All my surroundings warp and also I see huge halos around lights (prob cuz eyes get dilated from it) The last one I had was back in october. it sucks when it happens but I’ve been through it enough to know not to panic that anything is seriously wrong its just my autonomic system being out of wack. anyone deal with that sort of thing? level"

175915743,"If you expend energy beating yourself up for an unhealthy habit, you will have even less energy leftover for actually getting rid of the habit. Instead of berating yourself, maybe you can look into healthier alternatives that still give you some of the satisfaction of soda. For example, instead of coke, buy a nice juice. Or flavored seltzer. Or an iced tea. You can’t just deny yourself all enjoyable things forever and expect that to be sustainable. Soda is meeting a need in your life. If you eliminate soda, but do not address the underlying need, you will always go back to soda because you will always need a way to meet the need."

174332402,"Hi guys, I am having trouble processing and accepting my diagnosis. I recently underwent my first relapse and while it was short lived, I cannot help but to feel that I am so strange and so weird and I am so ashamed about what I experienced. Does anyone else have difficulties with their self esteem post a schizophrenia or psychosis diagnosis? The nature of my illness involved thought broadcasting where I felt violated by humanity who I supposed had access to my thoughts. I must believe that it is a by product of becoming taken over by my emotions and fears until such a time that I lose all rationality. Around this I constructed a narrative regarding Luciferian witchcraft given things I had been reading online (vigilantcitizen.com) about Hollywood, the music industry and entertainment industry. I also briefly heard _USER_ID_ and voices but I wouldn’t class myself as a voice hearer. And if I experienced a pain in my body, I supposed that something, some external entity was doing this to me. I don
t know why, I just don’t understand why I was vulnerable and credulous and naive in this way but I was. I feel really bad about myself. I feel guilty. In the back of my mind, I feel like I must be a total freak and I am having trouble overcoming the self _USER_ID_. Can anyone else relate?"

175915749,"A friend of our family was schizophrenic when I was younger. He was a hippie and a really nice guy and a cool guy. His illness took everybody by surprise. He had gotten married and had a kid which surprised everyone too because as long as we had known him he had just kind of bummed around the country eating out of orchards and soup kitchens. He became schizophrenic when I was about 17 and he was about 25. Right about the time I was 19 and became schizophrenic myself he died. He was up in Oregon by himself in winter and someone found him frozen to death outdoors in an orchard, sitting down with his back against a tree with no jacket. It was so sad, he was cool, he always treated me and my sisters nice. Poor guy."

175915778,"Vraylar wasn’t working that well for me: Insomia as a side effect (couldn’t sleep without many sleep drugs), it even worsed my negatives slightly and only improved positive and cognitive symptoms slightly. No withdrawal symptoms yet as far as I can tell. As I have tried all other APs before and Vraylar was the best for me since 10 years, I wanted to give _PERSON_ a try. If it improves social performance and has an antidepressant effect without serious side effects and without worsening the cognition compared to Vraylar, it would be a win!

And it wasn’t always perfect, but it was oh so meaningful! The reality of death is you cannot bring him back to this earth. His time was over, his days were ordained. Death is crushing. It’s devastating. It stings. It leaves us feeling like there wasn’t enough time, it shouldn’t have happened, there is supposed to be more, and longing for what could have been and what we think should be. I wish you could have seen him one last time. I wish you could have taken a picture. I wish you had a say in his cremation. The dynamics between you and your mom will be messy. You are both being forced to adjust to a new normal. There will be healthy and unhealthy responses to each other. You love each other very much. Love will win. I am hoping each of you can seek to understand the other, be moved with compassion, bear each other’s burdens, consider one another, 
and honor each other. Please don’t run. It won’t bring back your Grandpa, it won’t help your mom care for you better, it won’t stop the hallucinations, and it won’t keep you out of the hospital. Can you organize pictures of you and Grandpa and make posters or a video for the services? Is there something special you have that was Grandpa’s or something he gave you that you can have and hold? Can you write a tribute to him and share it with us, friends, and family?"

175915861,"No, early on in the year I was getting a diagnosis for it but then I switched psychiatrist’ and so I have no diagnosis; much less any access to the meds that could help. Truth be told. I don’t even know if getting a diagnosis is worth it anymore because I have a bad impression of psychosis causation if using stimulants like Adderal and Ritalin. If I remember right, the numbers are actually minute, but they still count as cases of relapse or psychosis. It’s put me off the idea of pursuing this Avenue of solution ; which was the main goal of this year. Covid got in the way (and the psyche chnage) Had I got stimulants I’d probably have improved ability to focus and therefore improved my exams"
175915862,"That does sound uniquely unfair. We’re pretty much the opposite. While I do feel pretty terrible when I wake up I start to feel better quickly. My doctor has me on Adderall as well, so that’s probably what makes my mornings a bit easier."

Usually in supermarkets - and then ive lost the flow of what im doing. When i was first diagnosed - they didnt send me to hospital, they just weaned me onto risperadone in prep for the depot jab. I slowly went mad and recovered on my own in my flat.

I don’t see as many doctors as I used to, and that makes me nervous- what if they think I’m better because I’m not being seen as much? I stopped taking pain pills for my back- does this mean they’ll think my back has stopped hurting? I take less migraine meds now because my insurance won’t cover as much- will they think I don’t need them? But still, I’m better than I was before the first review."

175915917,"I understand how difficult this must be. I had to drive my mom in law to the ER for a psych evaluation because she was a danger to herself and her husband. They were in their 60’s. She was in major mania. She had three sons but it somehow fell to me to do it. She was my best friend. She cussed me and screamed at me, screamed she would never forgive me, she hated me, I better not show my face near her. Broke my heart and I cried all the way home. But I was EXHAUSTED from no sleep for over a month due to her craziness. It was a relief. She was placed in a psychiatric ward, where they finally listened to me that she would not take her oral pills to help stop the mania. They started her on injections. After a month, she was finally back down to earth and did not remember all the ugly things she screamed. She was in her right mind. It was worth it. I really hope you have help and get results like we did. Btw, this was her third full blown episode of mania. The first two lasted almost four full months. 
She had no medication the first time, I got her to a psych dr the second time but they only would prescribe pills, which she for the most part refused to take by having screaming rages from her, that mania lasted almost four months. The third mania lasted two months- the first month was with no meds( she wouldn’t take them) and then she was started on injections. They worked. So two months mania was short for us. The psych evaluation and admitting her to the psych ward made the difference. Take care. Keep us updated."

(The pandemic didn’t help) I’m 39 years old, no family history of heart problems, I’ve had multiple ER visits, EKGs, Treadmill Stress test, Echo, and Halter and everythings come up fine. I also suffer from GERD so my doctor recently referred me to my gastroenterologist who said that my pain was myofascial/chest wall tenderness from anxiety but when I told him that my cholesterol was a little high he wanted me to have a cardiac CT. I don’t want to go through another round of tests but I’m tired of the chronic chest pain and the anxiety that comes it. I think I may have Somatic Symptom Disorder but I can’t get a diagnosis for that from the drs here. I’m just so tired of living like this and honestly at the end of my rope. Has anyone else been through this? Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated."

So social is slightly better overall but more patchy than solo.

Although comparatively safe, some side effects can occur with its use such as akathisia, extrapyramidal reaction, metabolic syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. Blood dyscrasia with lurasidone is rarely reported in the literature except for few case reports.

It’s more of a goal of mine to have a degree than put it to use. I’m looking into WGU online so it’s practically free for me. I would transfer and do my last 2 years there. I was never really good at math. I mean people tell me I was and I was to some extent, but I was late to the game, and it’s a young man’s game. I recommend getting serious now if you want to become good. I went from being pratically the best at my local community college in math to being average or below average in math at a competitive university. But I also had stuff going on and schizophrenia developing so there’s that. I transferred as an economics major but wasn’t in love with the subject or lack of rigor compared to what math majors do. You’ll probably love real analysis and stuff like that. That’s going to be one of your first real, 
upper division rigor math classes if you major in math. I knew my self and my skills. Compared to the average person, I was gifted. But compared to the genius or the real gifted people, I was a moron or average. That’s life pretty much. I just happened to stumble upon math at a late age. It was my worst subject in high school. I took remedial classes at community college but ended up getting As and doing well and finishing the sequence. Economics is fun too. But if you can understand math you can do pratically anything and go into any field. Good luck."

Am I crazy to believe I am a little bit crazy? If I admit being crazier than I am, will I be proving that I’m saner than I think I am? I no longer know who owns my thoughts, which I guess is due to depersonalisation, and I’m fairly convinced that solipsism holds true, at least in my case.

174332446,The main issue I have is the price of the injectables making going on disability a near certainty. And yes using the same old drugs and acting as though they’ve done all they need to do is a problem. I hope that there is no black market of products supposedly designed to remove the injection from the bloodstream but I think it’s almost inevitable as a new kind of non-compliance. Otherwise it’s nice to find out that some folks who “didn’t respond to treatment” were simply not taking their meds.
175915976,Maybe that’s not different. The provider and her husband don’t get along so he fails her constantly and that puts her on edge so anything the residents have going wrong gets belligerence.

He said he might start me on that next week but wants to see how i am doing on the 10mg of abilify. I asked him if i have schizophrenia. He said no. I have very bad anxiety and somataform disorder and depression he said. I will see doc again next week. I have found thankfully that the abilify may be working. I have not taken to the bed in two days, meaning before i started taking abilify, i was going to bed 5/6 times a day, spending most of my time in my room. I am really happy this is the case, some improvement. I can focus a little better i think, although i do not want to leave the house and am finding things difficult to do as usual. I do see that steel mask in my head with gnarling teeth and saliva at times, and think my neighbours are watching me or can read my thoughts and think people are watching me when i used to go to the shops, which i don’t anymore.I told doc 
all this. He said I hopefully will improve. I just thought I would update you who replied to my last post about docs visit. Do any of you take Lyrica.

174332462,"Ive always felt different. And awkward socially, so it felt like an identity. I think that I mistook the supportive role of psych workers, for people generally was going to be nice to me. But I never tell anyone why Im on disability, except family. I think the _USER_ID_ of disability is greater than the _USER_ID_ of schizophrenia. When I was hospitalized for the first time, and a guy who were there for 3-4 days, said I was the most normal person he´d met. And he was only having neurosis. So I kind of took that as an insult…"

174332456,Interesting. Let us know how it goes.
175916040,I was on 100mg of trazadone and it did nothing. Neither did melatonin
175916041,Ha. I had to google that. Interesting. Makes you wonder if there is a Mecca Syndrome as well lol.
175916042,yea but now its controlled my sugar is 74.
175916043,I take caffeine also to prevent napping. It gives a bit of energy.
175916044,"I told the doctor that my schizophrenia calms down and basically stops, when I am in a medical building (hospital or psych appointment.) She told me that several people mentioned the same thing. That made me think… if being in a medical building makes it stop, then there has to be some alternate way of curing it. I normally see and hear 10,000 to 20000 visions a day, without meds, but at the hospital, it’s only 20 to 100 times a day. That was a significant improvement. Although my symptoms were basically gone, just from being in the hospital, they gave me zyprexa, abilify, and ambien to sleep. I am scared to take meds, because I had 11 years of risperdal, unfairly prescribed. My psychiatrist assistant was bribed to keep giving me this dangerous medicine, way before I ever had schizophrenia! The fears of TD kept me off meds for seven years. I’m tempted to throw my meds away. Movement disorders are intense, even worse than schizophrenia. The judge says I must take them correctly. I remember hav
ing the TD problem in my last life. We layed on the floor with diapers and were hosed off to shower. It was worse than schizophrenia. The band mates of state has a song about it. “You’re shaking, it’s all you’ve got… and no more medicines in you”"
175916045,"Could you ask for different tools to accomplish your tasks? When I had OT/SLP services, I couldn’t walk, read, or write. My therapist gave me a series of little games to do every day, and I slowly built up my skills again. Now, my handwriting is neater than it was before my accident. She gave me blue sunglasses that helped me concentrate and remember what I was reading. She had me practice moving my head in certain directions to build up my muscles in my neck. I really think an OT should be doing more than telling you to work and exercise. They should be doing activities with you in session at least once a week, and then giving you homework to accomplish between sessions. If you aren’t getting what you want out of session, ask for a different approach. But for crying out loud, don’t just throw away services that the rest of us would love to have."
175916046,"^ His own words, my ass"
175916047,The point is you did act on it and you say the team was called out to help you…
175916048,Well like mine beats fast but not always hard. Only hard if I’m anxious.
175916049,That's a good plan!
175916050,Yeah. I vote for _NAME_’s parade though chordy’s bum might be scary

175916055,"Really _AT_MENTION_, I don’t think developing self worth is entirely an inside job. I know because I went through a really rough period growing up that lasted almost 5 years, so I know what you’re going through. It’s easier if you’ve never been abused by members of your family and/or you’ve never been bullied and/or been a bully."

175916059,"Positive self talk would do you a lot of good. When you hear yourself telling yourself things like I’m so ugly, I’m disgusting, everyone hates me, etc. Tell yourself to stop. And then, as if you were telling a dear friend in your position, correct that voice. Say something like, I’m not disgusting. It takes a lot of courage and strength to get through all I’ve been through. Or whatever encouraging/motivational thing you would want to hear from a friend or you would tell a friend. Treat yourself as well as you treat your friends."
175916060,That is good stuff when homemade.
175916061,"you changed your profile pic, didn’t ya. I still remember you though."
175916062,"Yeah, you're right. I guess it's just hard because of the medicine I'm on right now. Or maybe I'm just unsure what the medicine is supposed to be doing right now. It was my thought to go take a prescribed Xanax but I honestly don't know if that'll help or hurt my anxiety these days. Not to put this solely on my pdoc, but I think he is so wishy-washy with what he suggests that I feel like I can do almost anything with the meds. So I guess that might be what it's really about. Anxiety related to meds and what they're supposed to be doing. I know the combination has worked for a while and I know my pdoc wants me to continue on meds and stuff, but I am just super unsure about whether the meds cause my sluggishness and lack of motivation at times and the pdoc doesn't necessarily understand that. Of course, I want to continue on some level of meds. But, I also know that too high of dosages can be bad for me personally, as high dosages make me feel like a zombie."
174332467,"I was going to say to lower your dose to lower the akathisia but 10mg is the lowest Abilify dose. Abilify 25mg didn’t give me any akathisia but Latuda 120 and 80mg did. 120mg was intolerable, lasted more than 1-2hrs."

175916069,That sounds nice I’ve never seen quinoa wraps before. I got stuff to make scrambled eggs on toast with chives....I love chives and eggs together. I also got stuff to make an Italian sausage soup with peppers onions tomatoes in a v8 and chicken stock broth. It’s the easiest soup but the spicy ? Italian sausage gives it great flavor.
174332472,The issue of weed crops up frequently on here. Yes - most of us have tried it - to self medicate the condition. But its bad news. It will just increase your positive symptoms. And your essentially undoing the anti-psychotics your probably taking. If you wanna use for anxiety - go the CBD route - some have found that helpful.
174332477,i was doing fine on pills until I quitted them and was involuntarily admitted into the ward after 2 months

I can tell you that bladder control products really give you peace of mind and are undetectable by others."

175916081,"Today I walked out on my job. It happens every time. I work somewhere for 3 months to a year and then I quit because my anxiety gets too bad. This time around it was different. I'm 20 years old and have suffered from GAD and Panic Disorder as well as Depression and ADHD for ten years now. Back in January, I got a job at a dry cleaners. I was really good at it and was even told that I had the potential to be a manager one day. A couple months ago, however, I started having severe panic attacks almost daily. Today it became too much and I told my manager that I couldn't continue on like this and I was leaving. I didn't give notice, I didn't finish out the day, I just grabbed my stuff and left. That's how it always happens. Honestly, I don't know what to do. I'm a 20 year old who still lives at home and goes to my grandparents house when my mom leaves for work until she gets off because I'm too terrified to be home alone. This life I'm living doesn't even feel like a life anymore. I have so many thing
s I want to do with my time here on earth but am too afraid to even stay home alone for ten minutes by myself while my mom goes to the convenient store. I feel like a burden to my family because what 20 year old is like this? I feel like a baby but I'm at a total loss of what to do. Someone, anyone, please lend me some support or advice, or even reassurance that I'm not the only grown adult who lives like this."

174332483,"I'm not on meds -- am actually about to get started on them, but I can relate to how you feel. I've felt this way progressively as time goes on. Maybe it's a byproduct of Schizophrenia? It seems that way to me. Hopefully there's some kind of solution that can be found to stop or even reverse this."

175916115,"i have no idea if this will help but when your hearing the voices, see if u can tell if your tongue is slightly moving, or you may feel it in your throat. hearing voices can be related to subvocal speech misinterpretation. if so it will at least remind you that the voices are really just you in your own head, and because of the misinterpretation it created voices in your head. that awareness might calm it down. or when you start hearing voices, just try reading a book or something that will put the focus on text instead of your voices."

Once I moved out and back home, I reverted to old behaviors (eating late at night), gained back the 30 and then some. That was 15 years ago. I’d say the change in environment made the difference.

I like to take them after I eat and not close to the time I take meds so they won’t interfere with any of my meds. But it’s like I blank them out. It’s a shame because I feel better when I take them regularly. It seem the only time I notice them is when I am taking meds. Do you think it’s ok to take them at the same time? Hey _AT_MENTION_ do you think taking vitamins at the same time as meds is ok?

It could be something as simple as telling them you just don't get the same enjoyment out of x or y thing. Or, getting out of bed has been really difficult.

175916159,Good point. These voices are a part of one. I believe that my voices and if I could say most people voices are from the sub conscious. All our virtues and vices manifested into audio hallucinations. I think it is a good time to meditate or try to understand what our brain is trying to say. When I’m having a episode I try to understand my brains fear and it’s reasoning (if at all) behind it.

175916162,"If you describe it like this, it seems like this idea that there is a pure self, then as you interact, you have to compromise, and become something else, thus you loose some of yourself. I think they usually mean something more crippling when they talk about fear of engulfment. Usually it is a fear of loosing control and being dominated, but I believe it can appear also through identity diffusion, and in that case it is not the same as a rebellious/passive-aggressive personality. or it is both. So the closer the person gets, or more intimate, the more foreboding they get, as commitments grow and so on. It leads to self-sabotage of relationships. I am talking about the normal case here. People probably don't even recognize it at the time for what it is. I think the existentialists were talking more generally about interactions with people, not intimate ones, which is where this fear would show mostly. It's interesting, but I am more interested in the identity diffusion one, where you actually believ
e at some point that you are the other person. It's a lot scarier."

174332498,"I am on Abilify 5mg (to be 15mg eventually) and 36mg Concerta (switching to a non-stimulant soon) meaning that the insomnia is intense. By default, I do have severe insomnia. I have used antipsychotics Seroquel (partially for sleep, mostly for psychosis at 300mg) and Zyprexa (I think around 7mg for sleep before I began struggling with psychosis). Antipsychotics for sleep are far too sedating and unreliable. My brain was fogged (despite still having psychosis) and I had serious hypotension. I was always passing out on the more sedating ones. Which prompts me to the question, would antidepressants be great for insomnia? I once took 6 melatonin and slept for 20 minutes. That is how awful my insomnia is (and this was before Abilify and Concerta)."

175916180,I was on clozapine and began feeling weak. But I didn’t tell staff at hospital so I assumed it was just a side effect. It turned out my bloods detected an elevated level of tropozone blood stress enzyme. I was admitted to general hospital by ambulance and connected to ECG and ultrasound. My heart was inflamed. Two weeks later and one CT scan I am out of general hospital and back into psychiatric hospital. I hope this helps someone. I didn’t know I had a sensitivity to clozapine.

175916192,"My hallucinations almost have a psychic quality to them at times, it seems. I often hear them complain about how I do something or a choice I’m making. At times, they’ve actually steered me in a better direction than my typical knowledge/skills would, like in video games, as though I already inherently knew what I needed to do instead but wasn’t thinking of it for some reason. The voices often guise themselves as someone’s voice that I actually know, and they’ll comment on what I’m doing in those voices, even if there’s no way those people could know what I’m doing, worse so what’s going on in my head. It can be terrifying at times."

175916210,"There are different types of intelligence. The IQ test as we know it in the West is not only culturally biased, but it is gender and racially biased as well. For example, those of us who have been socialised as females have different ways of approaching problem solving than those socialised as males. The test does not take that into account. There is also emotional intelligence, non verbal intelligence, etc. The regular test measures your logic to a certain degree, but does not measure creative or artistic or musical ability. Also, since you’re here in this forum, you’re probably not neurotypical, and that also will affect your score. What I’m saying is, the standard IQ test isn’t reliable and is often not used anymore as a measuring rod in schools. And your score has nothing to do with how you use it. It’s probably not healthy to focus on a number with so many variables, because it says nothing about the human being you are. As long a you have a curiosity to learn new things (and you do,

175916223,"I’m pretty sure I have read that at least some AP’s can increase the risk for dementia. The drugs have a lot of non-intended effects on the brain, like for instance when blocking dopmine and serotonin. The problem is that a lot of metabolic processes in the brain depend on those substances. So you fix the immediate problem of psychosis, but create new chronic problems. All AP’s are counterindicated for people who already have dementia and that is not without reason. The best option to keep the brain healthy in my opinion is to supplement with vitamins and minerals and adoptogenic herbs to counter the drugs negative effects on the brain."

Don’t let that stop you from continuing to try whenever possible.

175916248,I’m hoping it will help. It seems things help in tiny amounts but then stop working.
175916249,I think it’s kicking in. Nothing bad is happening. I just feel calmer
175916250,_AT_MENTION_ I hope you have a good support system during this incredibly tough time…
175916251,When you are able to live on social security just enjoy your life and maybe share your experiences here and give advice.
175916252,Thank you
175916253,I’m going to an appointment for the Live Well program. It’s the halfway mark for the main part of the program. I’ve only lost about 5 pounds I think. We’ll see. After that I’ll probably go to the pharmacy to pick up meds and get some bows for my sister’s birthday presents. Then I’ll walk on the treadmill and workout with resistance bands. Other than that it’s going to be a quiet day. What will you do today? How are you feeling?
175916254,I regret all the times I fought my treatment. I could have had excellent function years earlier.

174332519,"Not suicidal right now. There was a “suicide” attempt apparently for no reason at all some time after I got my schizophrenia. I assume it wasn’t a suicide but a killing attempt - my schizophrenia wanted me dead for some reason (I suspect I did not have free will at the time, and I had no reason to kill myself), but it didn’t succeed. Some months after that, during my 8 month stay at a hospital, my schizophrenia took a different path - it tortured me with intense unpleasant feelings, and it felt like I prefer not to exist (while I did not want to kill myself either - wanting assumes will, and my free will was gone by that time, and my body was moving by itself). Then the “spirit” that controls my body tried to kill me several times in the hospital (maybe as a reaction to that feeling), but did not succeed. While I was in the hospital different methods of killing me went through my mind via inserted thoughts/ideas. Fortunately I’m not being tortured right now. I don’t know why my schi
zophrenia doesn’t want to kill me any more."
175916257,"No, it takes UP TO 6 months for symptoms to return. You quit your meds and you could go batty next week. Psychosis is too dangerous to risk over some nasal congestion. Why don’t you drink more water and go see a medical doctor instead of playing psychiatrist? And for the love of God, please get back on your meds. Actually, no, make an emergency appointment with your nurse practitioner and tell them what’s going on."

175916260,"They know me. I know them. They stumbled upon what really bugs me–laughter. So they keep doing it. I test it out and it’s subtle and I usually the only way I know when someone is bugging me is when it stops and I have relief from it. I’m not saying that I’m not delusional about it sometimes (I prefer to say that I’m “mistaken” about it a lot) because I am wrong about certain stuff, but after going through this for more than a year, I’m pretty sure I can tell the difference between laughter and no laughter."
175916261,"People in the inner city have mental illness too as it affects every level of society. As far as mass murders go I only hear of it in places “where it doesn’t happen”, or the suburban areas. Some of the killers are not mentally ill even though the press accuses all of them as such. I guess what I should have asked is have you heard of multiple people being killed in an inner city shooting, or heard of the shooter being mentally unstable? I think it’s racial profiling to call it all “gang related” shooting."

175916269,"_AT_MENTION_ it helps me to look at myself naked in the mirror for a little bit every day. Just keep doing it, and finding at least one thing to compliment yourself on, every single day.

Because of what they saw me go through."

I push as hard as I can to do something and I get tired and move onto something else. There's too much information that I have in my head. I don't know what to do with it. I'm worried about what other people think. I keep arguing with people in my head. People recommend me to do a million different things, which I put on a list. I bookmarked a bunch of things because I never feel like reading them or watching videos in the moment. I suppose I'll work in the morning. Hopefully I can think about what I want to do while doing tasks and coworkers won't bother me and that I can maybe listen to podcasts once I get the hang of it. I feel like my thoughts and feelings are dry and boring. I see some sort of light at the end of the tunnel but I feel like my brain is being fried."

175916296,"yeah maybe 6 days is a little too ambitious. I was even thinking of working 7 days a week so I could make some bank sooner than later. I would probably burn out. there are some weekend shifts available semi close, those would be 3 10-12 hour shifts, if I got one of those jobs I could work and go back to school, studying and completing assignments on my days off. but still maybe a little much. at the moment im thinking I will just work and earn enough for tuition then go to school full time. once I’ve completed my degree, I will then go back to work. every time I try to do both at the same time, I fail miserably. so at least 3 years of work in my future, before school, maybe even 5 years of work.

I sometimes get thought broadcasting in the waiting room at the doctor’s office and it’s takes everything I have to not get up and run out. I’m really impressed that you are holding it together. As far as suggestions go, I think everyone will say the same thing - are you taking your meds. If so, you might want to talk to your pdoc about a different one. There will be a med/meds that will stop the thought broadcasting and the voices, you just have to find it. Good luck, you’re doing really good. Take care."

This is what I did: brushed my teeth with very cold water, when I felt the urge to smoke, I got up and changed what I was doing, chewed regular gum, drank icy cold drinks.

174332535,"Hi, Affective flattening aka blunted affect, flat affect is the prominent negative symptoms in many mental illness whether its schizophrenia, bipolar, depression etc. It can also be seen in general anxiety, obssesive compulsive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder etc as a way to avoid the stressful situation. Main symptom in affective flattening is a gradual reduction in the amount of emotions a person feels whether its happy, sad, anger etc. This can be noticed in the facial, body expressions and in the talks too. In this thread I’ll give a list of natural supplements which will help you to lessen the affective flattening. When affective flattening reduces cognitive symptoms also improve thus reducing the affective flattening is one of the major treatment goal to reduce negative symptoms. Omega 3 fish oil soft gel capsule providing DHA and EPA. Try to take top quality one as we need only 1 per day. Top brands to choose from include Nordiac Naturals, Now Foods etc. Take it just before having 
dinner. Phosphatidylserine sunflower version 100 mg soft gel capsule. Take it preferably around 5 PM in an empty stomach. Timing can be varied but make sure taking with an empty stomach for maximum absorption. If you are working out then best time to take is few minutes before ending workout as it can reduce cortisol for better muscle recovery. DMG 125 mg on an empty stomach every morning especially on workout days as it helps in improving mood and gives energy boost etc. Vitamin B12 methyl version on an empty stomach. Dosage can be varied based on your current blood b12 levels. B12 is stimulating so take it early in the morning just like DMG on an empty stomach. No need to take b12 everyday but useful especially if your current b12 level is not optimal. Phosphatidylserine soy version 100 mg. Soy version is found to bring more stimulating effect like vitamin b12 thus useful to take it in day time. Also make sure your Vitamin D level and thyroid level is in optimal range as low vitamin D and thyroid level can 
itself contribute to negative symptoms. Above supplements help in memory, reduces depression, improves cognition, improves workout performance and have many other uses too thus all can benefit from these and best part is its totally safe with no side effects."
175916405,"I have a daily problem. I keep thinking I should be doing something, but no matter what ideas I get, I just don’t feel sure enough that I would actually want to do it, so I don’t do it.

Im integrating very hurtful, difficult things that come with loads of guilt, shame, anger, grief. Things i always ran away from. I think im trying to change some stupid patterns, f.e. im avoiding abusive or unavailable partners and im starting to be less codependent in social contacts. I try to communicate feelings, needs, boundaries. Im still not great, but i finally started learning instead of repeating the same type of stupidity over and over. Actually…I am proud of that.

Even got into service and represented a meeting at the monthly service meetings. It’s a good program, saw many people in meetings with years and years of good recovery.

So I decided on drip but then I realized that I only drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day and maybe Keurig really would be more cost effective, less waste. Then I decided on a teal 4 cup coffee maker and actually bought it but it was lost in shipping and I got a refund and I was so happy because I changed my mind about the size and color. I finally decided on a beautiful white 12 cup drip coffee maker. I got it for $30 of Wayfair. It’s a nice one too. It should be here in a couple days."

I'm even in school finishing my degree. I haven't self-harmed in nearly three years. That's huge, considering I struggled with it for 10+ years. I am so much better than I used to be. The one person I thought would be by my side through it all doesn't seem to care, but you know what? That's okay. I'm better for it. I have people who love me now unconditionally. I really thought I would have more to say about this. Each day is a struggle, but it also gets easier every day to exist. I am so glad I stuck around."

We don’t confront the things before us as something different; we confront them as something we already know, as if everything fits into pre-ordained buckets of knowledge, as if those buckets weren’t themselves created, as if buckets and categories themselves weren’t buckets or categories that might impede knowing. … to make sense, we look backwards to the already known rather than looking to what’s in front of us and wondering: What new world flourishes here?” We don’t seek out other ways of making sense of the same old things."

All I wanted was for me to know that I could get an education because I failed so badly at school I made friends with a guy who was homeless, and he was going to be a social worker. Unfortunately he disowned me when I became psychotic. That was sad. Anyways, I think you could do university if you did an access course, as instead of learning through subjects, they actually taught you the practical study skills knowledge you need to do university as an adult."

175916462,They are thinking of putting me on it after my competition
175916463,That was really good. What a great collaboration!
175916464,"Well thank God, I’m glad everything turned ok good"
174332556,I had to look up “chronotropic incompetence” due to my vocabulary incompetence.
175916465,This is awesome _AT_MENTION_! Oddly enough I was listening to Stand by Me when I scrolled acrossed this thread.
175916466,I tend to agree with the Stoics in that as long as you are virtuous and ok with your conscience “external” and physical events can’t make your life a complete hell.

175916469,Find something to treat yourself with like a massage or something when you’re finished
175916470,"Hating people is a waste of energy that can be used productively elsewhere. It’s not hurting them, but it will hurt you. Minimize your contact with others if you have to for your own health, but try and spend your time building yourself up rather than mentally tearing others down. Do you have any hobbies to distract yourself with?"
175916471,"I was only on it for a couple weeks. I started gaining weight fast so I quit it. Certain APs may have a paradoxical effect on us and make our symptoms worse, other people on here have experienced that before. It sounds like this is not a good med for you."

175916473,"Watch my favourite TV programmes on my phone, either it be TV play series or Talk shows."
175916474,"I felt this way most of my life. I was always alone, and every time things started to go well, something terrible would happen to ruin everything. I didn’t see any way for things to get better. A friend convinced me to check myself into the mental hospital and ask for real help. It started to shift slowly. I put in lots of work during therapy, and learned how to treat people better. Then, I started having an easier time making and keeping friends. Forming healthy connections with others helped a lot. I got a job and was able to actually be successful at it because I was on medication that helped me. The real turning point for me happened when I got injured at work. I almost died, and for the first time in my life I was Not okay with that. I realized that I actually wanted to keep living. It was such a weird realization. I had never thought of myself as suicidal before that moment. Just very comfortable with the idea of dying. But to suddenly feel the total absence of that background wish for deat
h was frightening. I actually had reasons to stick around. Things I wanted to accomplish, people I wanted to keep spending time with. I actually saw hope in the future, and not just an endless void of suffering. Now, I am super glad I stuck around to see what my life would become. If you had told me 8 years ago that I would one day be happy, married, a parent, with good friends, I wouldn’t have believed it. But it happened for me and it can happen for you."
175916475,Ahahahah ok i guess i’m “schizoslow”
175916476,It isn’t that bad. Unless you have a low pain threshold.

175916478,"Thanks, _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ . I don’t think 5htp might do it, since im more or less resistant to serotonerg AD’s. But I hope my Pdoc asks her colleagues about their experience with buprenorphine. It’s very rarely prescribed in Denmark, but it might be my AD. I don’t have psychosis or lack of control on dopamine agonists. I will definitely try to buy some sarcosine online. I have “green fingers” and consider growing my own supplements, microdosing etc."

Can use google photoscan it eliminates glare....I may trash my old art too. I have photos of everything...I mean I’ll save the best like what I’ve got on the walls but maybe that’s it. I just need to minimize my stuff if I’m going to live here and sell the condo maybe in spring....

I am graduating with my masters in family counseling soon. My parents are both still alive but are not allowed in my life. All they do is cause pain. But I am happy and my kids are happy and safe from their unhealthy behaviors. It is all about perspective. I hope this helps and good luck on your journey.

175916491,I did. It felt really good too because it was a hot shower and it was so cold this morning.
175916492,"Well the issue here is that that’s not necessarily a hallucination associated with psychosis. It happens to everyone. And you’re not doing any work to correct it, your brain fixes it automatically. If those are your only symptoms these days, I think that your meds, and, of course, your efforts, are working very well. I’m very happy for you, _AT_MENTION_ ."
175916493,Yes they do fortunately

175916495,Putting more stress on mentally ill ppl like me just make things worse and yes I will go homeless if no one took care of me. Pretty sure of that as I have no energy to maintain a house. You dont treat mentally ill ppl with hitting them or putting them in extreme/stressful situations it might end up with suicide. I would have tried to kill myself a 3rd time if my parents didnt take care of me.
175916496,"Lower than normal temperatures are often indicative of hypothyroidism. Personally I would try kelp supplements to make sure it’s not an iodine deficiency which is very common now, since we often use salt that’s not iozed (sea salt, kosher). Also, once openened iodine evaporates rather quickly from salt containers. Could also ask for complete thyroid panel or see an endocrinologistl, not just the basic TSH test, but you’ll find that it might take begging for it."
175916497,I had a dream the other night that my tongue swelled up so much I couldn’t speak and now I’m paranoid that’ll happen in real life.

175916512,Yesterday you knew how much better your life has gotten since being on Vrylar. Do you not remember three years ago when you literally electrocuted your brain because you were so desperate to feel better?

175916516,"I'm looking up ways to increase self awareness. 95% of people think that they are self aware when in reality, it's 10-15% of people that are actually self aware - So 80% of people are lying to themselves about lying to themselves. I've become painfully aware that the paradox is real which doesn't mean anything and does at the same time - so I can ignore it. I feel like I went mad because it was necessary to lose my mind. I might lose my mind again which is a needed thing. It's steps up and up of losing the mind until you become aware of the ever changing environment - Until you've caught up with it. There's things that I don't like and like about myself in objective reality which I have to deal with and things that I don't like and like about myself in my subjective reality which are wrong and that I have to change to fit objective reality. It's as simple as that. Then I will be more confident, creative and able to deal with the fear. If you don't have fear, I don't think you can ever know because 
then you won't change... But if it's working for you, then that's good. I feel like I was using antipsychotics to get rid of stress when I wasn't sure of reality. Now I know what reality really is - Because of the psychedelic use. There's many ways to get rid of stress and I should use those instead - Unless I actually have an issue with too much dopamine (I don't know if I do because stimulants don't make me psychotic. Psychedelics can but that's because they dissolve the ego.. Something that everyone holds onto when they're hurt by one upping themselves or hurting others, still by one upping themselves)."

175916542,The advice would be the same as in the previous thread where you asked this. You need to speak to a doctor and tell them you’re having these thoughts.
175916543,I’ve minimized interaction with others for most of my life. That’s why I’m doing relatively okay right now while everyone else is developing mental health issues from isolating. I was born for this ????.
175916544,"I believe that if you pay the effort of getting what you want, you get it some day. I was a high school drop out. Even after searching for other high schools to accept me, none of them did because I was not a local in where I live and because of other circumstances. I started to work part time for a few years. I was also unlucky to find an employer who didn’t give me any benefits a normal worker should get and even refused to pay me my salary. I brought this up to a government labour department and finally got my salary. After switching job, I was isolated and bullied by co-workers at work but I continued to work there for two years because I needed to pay for night school to get my high school degree. Things have gotten better after I switched to another job again, without the bullies. I finally got my high school degree, but I will take the examination again to get better grades next year, which means one more year of part time work and night school life. I do aim at getting at least a higher d

175916554,Because you were not smart enough to see that you needed a job at 18 so you’d at least qualify for SSDI when you got sick rather than pursue that worthless college degree here’s how you’d do with a $15/hour work day. You’d be limited to working 52.8 hours without losing that precious medicaid. (that’s right try a first generation drug and see if you get lucky).

175916586,"That’s a good way to put it. I wanted to say something similar but I knew it would be pointless because some people don’t want to accept the truth! Everyone gets sexual thoughts. It’s perfectly normal and the more you try not to think about something the more you will think about those things. I get sexual thoughts and I have no desire to have sex at this point in time.

174332578,"I don’t think it’s helpful that’s when someone new comes along to share there experience and troubles with their illness and what people have done to them regardless of knowing of their illness or not that they are indirectly shamed for sharing and being open, with threats of future ramifications in their life of revealing their hardships from their illness. Szc is a very very tough illness to have and many of us have multiple diagnosis to tend with. If we haven’t suicided alone or at least speculated it due to the distress of our illness it is a miracle as ths burden of this illness is baring. I wonder whether the people that comit crimes against Ppl with MI, bully them when they are vulnerable, mentally abuse them and use them as a scape goat to project their own issues, ever think about the future ramifications of their actions. Will this person be in danger of I spread this rumour, and add to it, to make myself seem important, or to bond with my peers over the demise of another. What ar
e the future ramifications of attacking another, vulnerable human being that clearly is nog interested in your politics and jealous competition when they know it’s a game they can never win. I doubt they have given it a second thought. This forum (where people share their feelings, experiences and thoughts on their illness which is specific to schitzophrenia) has been running for years and I have read all types of post from regulars who are always on here to lend a helpful hand and the people that come and go and only communicate when the intensity of the illness gets too much. I know MI still has a _USER_ID_ to the old age of ‘jock’ mentality in society, which if people are not living under a rock will realise that mind state of survival of the fittest is dying out. We value animals and the environment as a top priority now days, hence the vegan movement and climate change etc. We are more empathetic as a whole, which has created change. If you can’t discuss your MI on a MI forum that’s been runnin
g for years with constant posts globally daily then where can you chat? If a bit more respect of others was passed around, people wouldn’t get so highly distressed, hence exaseebations their MI symptoms. I wish sz on no one, it’s an awful life threatening illness, that is so distressing when unstable, it’s in predictable also. You may be OK, you may relapse. Having a field day with someones MI diagnosis and things they share on a sz forum is such a low blow. I feel sorry for anyone that does this. If they are well, why are they on a sz forum? I would say, make sure everything about your profile is annonamous."

Since the last 1 year or so I am symptom-free. I am off Clozapine now. No side effects except a dry throat. My illness became insidious when I migrated to the US at 17. I had a lot of delusions (Psychosis), Mania, and Depression. I was suicidal at 17 first. It was worse between 17 and 20. I did a lot of suicidal ideation along with being in Psychosis. My Psychosis were delusions rather than voices. There was replete mania, in hindsight. At 25 I started getting voices. Right here I was incorrectly diagnosed with Bipolar. For 3-4 years I had esoteric experiences. Then there was the correct diagnosis at 28. I was eventually put on various combinations
. Since the last 3-4 years I was on Clozapine. I had almost recovered fully, but was getting strong side effects. Now I am off Clozapine and getting a few side effects.

They say say they do this to everone and the torture is commonly worse than burning alive they say for most and I ask them why they do this and they say it’s what you deserve and it’s mostly for fun. I try to counteract them with the opposite of what they say and staying positive but they make me feel dumb for doing this and tell me to wakeup to their truth they say is the only truth. Aperently they gave me chances to be a god but I smoked cigarettes and told me that made me the weakest being and bard me from being one of them and now they say its law that I get tortured forever and they won’t give me another chance and say thats law. I keep saying thats its not real but weird stuff as happend that clues in that iam living in a false reality. Like people at the store acting weird or my mom getting very imotional for no reason.

When I had been there a week or two a mental health agency sent a lady to talk to me about moving into a long term board & care home. She turned out to be pretty nice and she asked me a bunch of questions and had me fill out some forms. That took about 45 minutes and then she told me, “Now for my favorite part of the interview.” She wanted to hear my story. So I told her about my childhood, I told her about smoking pot in high school. I told her about all the different jobs I had after high school. I told her about my first psyche ward and being in the hospital for 8 months. About becoming employed again, and then getting addicted to crack and then getting clean. Then I had a bunch of more jobs and then moving out on my own for twenty years and going to college and I told her about getting cars and stuff. When I finis

175916844,"I am a voice hearer and on occasion have tried to re-enter the workplace in order to join the mainstay of normal life, aiming at making new positive acquaintances, and trying to gain some confidence at performing normal tasks, with the hope of enjoying whatever it is I am doing whether it’s volunteering within an NGO or charitable organisation, aiming at helping people like me, or it could be taking an interest in catering or something else. Though what eventually pans out through the experience is the exact opposite, of which as someone who unfortunately hears voices and is somewhat out of touch with common modern life, I am a bit of a social pariah who has some physical problems with my appearance and speech. So it’s to be expected to be a little tricky at first, though TBH what I experience is something that most people when you try to explain it they don’t fully comprehend, so I would like to take the time to recant my personnel perspectives upon these sometimes torturous events. So, you 
go through the process of finding a role or job, you attend the interview and are feeling optimistic about the new supposedly positive change, and await the first week to approach. The first week seems to be O.K and the people seem quite friendly and understanding and you try to complete tasks that should be straight forward, with a little mess. But nothing too disastrous. Then just as you think you’re starting to become settled in, the Games begin, this is where it gets interesting ( remember that I am a voice hearer and you’re not supposed to visually hallucinate). And some of the explanations may sound a little like psychosis. The first stage is that you are nervous so the ‘Voices’ are having a field day lapping it up as you try to concentrate upon the tasks without looking like a dick, the second stage is that you have the strange experience of thought broadcasting and have to overlap it with something else, so you imagine songs in your head a bit similar to earthworms, in order the close down the 
conversation within your mind, you may get a bit flustered and be aware that your co-workers can see this. The third stage is after the honeymoon period is over, it’s usually about two months, you’ll notice a change within the attitudes of your co-workers, get a little narcissistic and have playful at first fun directed at you, You naturally assume it’s due to poor work performance and try to make a noticeable improvement. Though the ‘Voices’ are all laughing at you and having a ball at your expense, imagine the audience of a certain America talk show host with the initials of _PERSON_ this is making the task even more tricky. Then as you try to work out the thought broadcast some of your co-workers start to gaslight you by repeating them in a subtle way, you may have a room full of customers all drunkenly laughing at your hallucinations by repeating what the context was, you sometimes might jokingly ask a question about this only to be gas-lighted by the reply. So the fun and games proceed like thi
s behind your back as you become marginalised and put within a corner, sometimes it can become strangely threatening with certain circumstances. And you after a few months leave before having some kind of accident. There is more I could detail though it’s good to keep, posts short. Anyway, how common are these experiences with other voice hearers? It would be great to hear back from some of you."

174332631,"With regard to the validity of the theory that auditory hallucinations are, in part at least, a product of subvocal (very quiet) speech, there is a 1990 paper (available from ResearchGate if you create a free account) Green, M. F., & Kinsbourne, M. (1990). Subvocal activity and auditory hallucinations: Clues for behavioral treatments?. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 16(4), 617-625. which concludes (regarding the theory) “In summary, the studies that have considered subvocal activity and auditory hallucinations have often used very small sample sizes, poor or absent diagnostic procedures, relatively insensitive measurements, and inappropriate analyses. Nonetheless, the preceding studies have yielded provocative findings and some support for a potentially useful theory.If auditory hallucinations are associated with subvocal activity, this relationship could be helpful in developing an effective intervention technique.” p.619 The paper goes on to compare auditory hallucinations in control (baseline), mou
th open, biting tongue, making a fist, raising eyebrows and humming conditions and finds that auditory hallucinations are reduced in the latter humming condition only, consistent with the theory that auditory hallucinations are produced by or related to subvocal speech. More recent research… This paper finds that vocal auditory hallucinations are associated with activity in the language producing parts of the brain. _NAME_, D. (2004). The cognitive neuropsychiatry of auditory verbal hallucinations: an overview. Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, 9(1-2), 107-123. I have asked if the author would post to Research Gate. This 2013 paper, which is available in pdf on the Net, measured EMG measured micro muscular movements of lips and (as a baseline) the forearm, and found that the lips moved more when auditory hallucinations were present. _PERSON_, L., _PERSON_, M., Polosan, M., Perrier, P., & _PERSON_, H. (2013). An EMG study of the lip muscles during covert auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Journal of S
peech, Language, and Hearing Research. I have no idea about non vocal auditory illusions such as gunshots, and multiple voices at the same time, and I agree that these phenomena do demonstrate that the theory is weak, or even dumb. The Russian psychologists, such as _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ saw linguistic thought as developing from children’s babbling that gradually becomes quiet, and thus I presume that subvocal speech is a sort of developmental throwback to the time when thought was spoken. If this theory were correct, it would be reasonable to assume that some or all adults can produce inner speech without sub-vocalisation some of the time, but it would still suggests that inner speech is in essence, or at least in origin, silenced speech. If vocal auditory hallucinations were similar in nature, then humming and other activities that use the vocal cords might help, to an extent. I am not particularly into humming. I am interested in what thought is, and what it implies. _PERSON_ claimed that speech and ling
uistic thought implies a listener, real or imagined. He attempted to demonstrate this by putting young babbling children into a room with other children that do not speak the same language. He found that these children stop babbling on about what they are doing when they realised that no one was listening. He argued therefore that self-talk, and thought, is predicated by the dream of, or accompanied by, an imaginary friend. That was my experience, in my case. I am reminded of Gollum, in the Hobbit, talking to “my precious,” “the ring”. I guess that was what _PERSON_ was going on about."

174332649,"Nah, I’m not getting manic at all. Im an energetic person but I usually keep it with my family and friends. I felt like sharing with you guys today My dz is psychotic disorder f 23.1"
175916975,They’re good. I like them.
174332660,"_AT_MENTION_ I have been reading you posts for weeks and take an interest. If I am not mistaken, you told us you had apathy, nothing to do, no motivation. There may be good reasons, sad to say. Maybe for a while you were incapable of work so you just had to chill out. But I discovered something today. I think I can provide things to do for the mentally ill. I had this great idea for you and others. Take a shower. This is just a little bit of work, but it is so helpful. It cleans the body and clears the mind some too. Tell all your cronies here to take a shower. Talk about it. I am not forcing, but I am trying to make it clear and then it won’t be such a struggle. This is work, just learning to take a shower. Having daily bread will help with the negative symptoms. You also might want to make your bed."
175916976,"By reducing my brain inflammation with medication, supplements and diet, I’ve had much nicer experiences with my voices at night, when I’d still hear them. They would actually say things like “heaven” since it was much easier to keep my mind-state positive. Now I only hear very quiet voices when I play a certain repeating prayer song (called a “simran”,) or whenever I eat junk food (like during these holidays.) During diet induced flareups I don’t have that grounded feeling of being confident of my future."

175916980,_AT_MENTION_ I don’t have voices. I think it is a cognitive thing. Difficulty concentration and memory issues. I also can’t follow story lines of movies even if I’m on my own watching it without any distraction.
175916981,"I was always told by professionals that hearing voices is a psychotic symptom, as you’re experiencing it but it’s not real. So in a way your reality is distorted/altered. I think I understand what you mean though. Having the voices doesnt mean you’re in a full blown psychotic episode, and that’s what I use to describe what you mentioned."
175916982,"I had similar on my clinic letter the other day, saying i was isolating myself from psychotic anxiety and paranoia.But the trouble is there really is arseholes out their that either take the piss and call me a nutter - or think they can tax me for money, just cos ive got an MI, cos they think im thick. So its not paranoia in my case - its bloody true! One bloke had me round the neck one day. And they wonder why i only go out unless i have to. I know when im being paranoid for gods sake - ive had years of practice!"

175917006,"_AT_MENTION_ I never said there should be an unlimited amount of breaks, or that the total time of the breaks would be more than the fixed breaks. Also, people with mental illness are not going to “disappear unannounced.” Here is an example of flexibility in the workplace: I went to the dentist a few months ago, and the day before my appointment the hygienist broke her wrist. My appointment was not cancelled because the dentist cleaned my teeth. The dentist didn’t say: “It’s not in my job description to clean teeth.” Employees (all employees) appreciate flexibility, and flexibility increases productivity. Thus, efficiency, productivity, and loyalty (less employee turnover) increases, which results in an increase in earnings. Employer and employee (all employees–including employees with a mental illness) flexibility is a win-win situation."

175917014,"SACshmo: You said, “Also I’d like to point out that the therapeutic part of this site is that I am able to know I am not alone, along with being able to talk about my life. Again, thank you all for sharing <3” Here of late, I haven’t gone that far back into my past, my childhood. It might be because of a woman who gave me some advice at an All-Anon meeting, which I want to tell you about later, but you said it was therapeutic to know that you are not alone, “along with being able to talk about my life.” So, my mother was sexually abused by her father. I know that from some stories she told, and that in my view she was a borderline personality syndrome person which is often the result of childhood sexual abuse, which is usually in women. So from looking at the end product, borderline, it would have started with sexual abuse. Also, I know she was sexually abused from her behavior. Borderline behavior. Second such sign of behavior, she sexually abused my older brother and sister. How do I 
know that? My older brother and sister are also borderline and also both of them hated me. Why? Because they realized I wasn’t sexually abused, so they tried to physically and mentally abuse me. As part of his borderline behavior, my brother had a hellacoiuis temper, plus he had my dad’s condition of, now seems to be called “Intermittent Explosive Disorder.” When I was 6 or 7, and my brother was 9 or 10, he beat me with his fists in front of the family who was eating dinner and the only response from the family was my dad saying, “Aw, Bill, knock it off” or something like that. It probably represented the dichotomy or divide of our family, in that, at times it seemed very good, and at times it was pathological, for we were playing after supper games at the table when that slaughter and inappropriate response from the family occurred. That’s who we were. The pathology was represented by my mother, who again, was sexually abused, and abused my older sister and brother. Thus my brother’s intense 
anger over losing an after supper game to his younger brother. Also, my mother’s non response to watching the beating, for she knew she had caused that anger by sexually abusing my brother, and so she did not step in to stop it, or punish my brother in any way. My older sister, who was also sexually abused by our mother, wouldn't physically attack you, she would simply try to destroy you. She never spoke, she would wait for you to speak and then tell you you were wrong, same tactic as my mother, who also never spoke. Oh, here’s one for you. My sister was terribly close to my mother, who sexually abused her. My mother was helpful and comforting to my sister, who my mother had sexually abused. My sister would also try to destroy the family, such as the evening she tried to destroy everyone's Christmas. It was a few days before Christmas. We were going shopping for presents. We were all 5 in the car and before my dad cranked it up, my brother (11) and sister (13) started arguing in pathological tones of voic
e and words. Of course, those were the two who were sexually abused. I was 9 and just listening in amazement, I was not sexually abused and did not participate in the argument, trying to figure out, what is wrong with my family? And neither of my parents moved to correct them. Mom did not, because she caused the disruption, and because as a sexually abused person herself who was torn up, she wanted her children to be torn up and she wanted her husband torn up and she wanted her family torn up. I’m sitting there trying to figure this all out. One time my brother and I were playing baseball. He would told me I would be the catcher, since we had found a catcher’s mitt somewhere, and he would be the pitcher. I about 10 and he’s about 12. First, he didn’t stand back far enough from me. Second, he threw the ball as hard as he could. It glanced off the top of the mitt, and the ball hit my chest going quite fast. That could have killed me. Well, yeah, that’s what he was trying to do. So from all of that I h
ad low self-esteem. I tripped myself up many times from that."
175917015,"Thank you, that is helpful. I just feel like I can't even stay on top of basic things like cleaning, brushing my teeth, showering, etc. I don't know what my problem is.

175917035,"Hi, according to a doctor I do have a schizoid personality, but not yet SPD. (I'm married etc. So it's a bit between the normal dogs and the full package of iron independence for me Recently I got promoted from a schizoid-heaven-software-developer-state-the-whole-day-in-the-screen-position into a management position. Not very special, 2 years time, a few million $ budget, leading a few people. Finally I was cut from the position because people found me strange and not diplomatic enough. Also I couldn't fight the NPDs and AsPDs, Machiawellis etc. who tried (and finally succeeded) to steal the prestigious project from me.

So like, a true hallucination in dx terms, would involve physically hearing it and/or thinking the hallucination was coming from an outside source (thoughts being implanted in your head, etc). A pseudo-hallucination is supposedly not as difficult to treat, because the person understands and aknowledges that the hallucination is simply their brain misfiring.

175917075,"college and university mean the same thing to me, although im sure there is a difference. the local community college credits transfer to in-state universities, so many students will go that route their first couple of years before transferring to a university with their field of study. however, i don’t think i had the option of going to community college while i was still in K-12, or grade school, unless i would’ve received my high school degree or GED, before hand. i think this is a new thing where high school students are earning university credits by taking extra college classes, while they are still in grade school before earning a diploma. it will save them a couple years of university and they will graduate sooner, and be in the workforce sooner, or moving on to a master’s degree quicker. a bachelor’s degree at university is typically 4 years, which includes general _NAME_ requirements, like english, speech, social science,and humanities. but since they are able to get those out of t

175917082,"-On the 9th July I was 84 kg and weighed myself after daily exercise and between a 1200-1500 calorie a day diet and have lost 3kg. That is 81 kg now! I have a way to go yet, but I am pleased with this progress. I get on my exercise bike and do a 15km session, do 70 press ups and over 100 bicep curls with 5kg weights. I eat a couple of tortilla wraps with a meat, lettuce, tomato, spring onions, mushrooms for my dinner.A small measured in grams breakfast of a sugar free granola, baked strawberries and semi skimmed milk and for a night time snack i have two slices of fruit loaf. I have one or two pieces of fruit a day. I don’t weigh myself often, because daily fluctuations make it silly to do so. I gave up alcohol entirely, of which I was on 18 cans of beer a week (which is 3100 calories). It’s a bit boring but a necessity to lose weight. I have a few months of dieting to go to get down to a good weight. I just hope i don’t plateau too soon."

174332685,"Double Bind as a Theory _PERSON_ et al. (1956) proposed that schizophrenic symptoms are an expression of social interactions in which the individual is repeatedly exposed to conflicting injunctions, without having the opportunity to adequately respond to those injunctions, or to ignore them (i.e., to escape the field). For example, if a mother tells her son that she loves him, while at the same time turning her head away in disgust, the child receives two conflicting messages about their relationship on different communicative levels, one of affection on the verbal level, and one of animosity on the nonverbal level. It is argued that the child’s ability to respond to the mother is incapacitated by such contradictions across communicative levels, because one message invalidates the other. Because of the child’s vital dependence on the mother, _PERSON_ et al. argue that the child is also not able to comment on the fact that a contradiction has occurred, i.e., the child is unable to metacommunicat
e (Bateson et al., 1956). The symptomatology of schizophrenia, it is argued, reflects the accommodation of the individual to a prolonged exposure to such interactions. Once ‘victims’ have learned to perceive their universe in terms of contradictory environmental input, the inability to respond effectively to stimuli from the environment is no longer contingent on the extent to which stimuli from the environment are contradictory in specific interactive sequences. Instead, the individual will generally experience any input from the environment as conflicting information without being able to discriminate between different communicative levels. In the long run, this inability manifests itself as typically schizophrenic symptoms such as flattened affect, delusions and hallucinations, and incoherent thinking and speaking (_PERSON_, 1956). It is further stipulated by _PERSON_. (1956) that double bind interactions have a pathogenic effect only if they occur in a context where the accurate discrimination of mess
ages is of vital importance for the participants, and in a relational context which is characterized by intense levels of involvement between the participants. The interaction between parents and children within the nuclear family is a typical example of such a relational context. At least the following twelve components can be distinguished in double bind theory with potential for operationalization as variables in empirical work: (1) schizophrenia, (2) conflicting injunctions, (3) communicative levels, (4) prolonged exposure, (5) ability to comment (6) escape from the field, (7) intense involvement, (8) discrimination of levels, (9) relational context, (10) learning to perceive, (11) double bind patterns, and (12) vital importance of the relationship. The interrelationship between these components is clearly stated in the theory, but too complex to be captured in a single hypothesis. We need to recognize that different hypotheses derived from this theory may fare differently upon empirical scrutiny."

This in July and this time without hurting myself but still got sectioned as I have risk history with self harm. I have 8 440ml beers yesterday drinking alone. (Christmas is a difficult time for me) - first time I drank in 7 weeks, not intoxicated. I start obsessing about microchips. I haven’t thought about delusions since October. Why is it when I have a few beers? I don’t really need advice not to drink as I do know this. Does alcohol lesson the potency of antipsychotics and makes these thought come back?"

175917187,"Hi all, I hope today finds everyone calm and in good spirits. I wanted to bring up a new med for discussion which my GI dr has given me. The med is called Donnatal. It is a combination of Phenobarbital, atropine, levsin and scopolamine. It is both a sedative medication and a med for IBS. I took two today and it has calmed me quite a bit and helped my abdominal cramping. I feel relaxed and quite tranquil for a change. I was wondering if anyone had tried it. It is very costly and not covered by my insurance. I have to pay for it out of pocket which is almost two hundred dollars per month. Ouch!!!! I know. I am desperate and will pay for it for a while if it helps. Why my insurance wont pay is beyond me. As I understand it is quite an older med. No generic available I was told. Most drs do not want to prescribe because of the Phenobarbital. Looking forward to any comments from all. I looked it up for reviews from others and it was heralded as a great med for IBS along with anxiety. Many people complai
ned it was not covered and drs were reluctant to prescribe. It broke my heart as so many people said it helped them so much many many years ago. God bless you all"

174332706,"_AT_MENTION_ thanks so much for your reply. I’m going to ask my psychiatrist about Aristada. Looks like it helps block the mesolimbic action while ENHANCING mesocortical action in the brain. So basically you can prevent positive psychotic delusional symptoms while not dampening out the persons personality, functionality, or emotions. That is so cool! If I could find something like that I’d actually PREFER taking it over not being on meds. My brain is so cluttered and I always thought it was from a dysfunctional mesocortical dopamine pathway. Is Aristada expensive? I know inVega is only $10 with the discount card (which I’m currently using), but after a year you have to pay full price which is crazy. Is Aristada a new medication without generics? How long does the injection last for? Thanks again so much for having such a useful perspective to help me through this"

I saw one guy work 83 hours a week so he could buy a car. My roommate at school wanted to be a chemical engineer, and he stayed up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning studying while I was his roommate. Chemical engineering is probably multi faceted, and he was probably shooting for something high within that career facet. I guess these guys’ success depended on their hard work.

I’ve never had a problem. Doxylamine is a first generation antihistamine for allergies. There are plenty of schizophrenics with allergies who take antihistamines. It’s probably safe. Either ask your pharmacists/doctor or start with a small dose 1/2 or 1/4 pill and see what happens. _USER_ID_: Doxylamine and Abilify Drugs.com Drug Interaction Report - Drugs.com Doxylamine and Clozapine Drugs.com Drug Interaction Report - Drugs.com For the record I’ve had that site tell me interactions where “severe” but I was fine when mixing them so take it with a grain of salt.

The nice thing is that I didn’t sleep all day, and when I did wake up, I actually felt awake! It was such a nice change. I just hope I don’t have any ill effects from the decreased dose. Before this, we had decreased me to 5mg in the mornings. In 2 weeks, we go to 5mg at night. Our hope is that it will decrease my TD symptoms if I go on another med. That new med, lumateperone, sounds really promising because it is supposed to have less extrapyramidal side effects and be a bit more like clozapine in that sense. So I’m hoping my pdoc will let me stay on 5mg/night of Saphris until the lumateperone has been around longer. She won’t prescribe it until it’s been out for at least 6 months."

174332735,"Realized I talked about going to school and work for 9+ years and tried doing something. Can’t even brush teeth and shower and change clothes right now. I mainly just live to smoke cigs and drink energy drinks. I try to read but I figure my brain is turning to mush with all these chemicals and I don’t exercise. Topamax has a numbing effect on the brain but it’s sort of relaxing. It does dumb one down but it also helps me lose weight. I’m tired of being 290 lbs. I look fat. I’m not healthy. I used to be a hard working college student. I achieved my goal of getting into my dream school with an acceptance rate of 15% from a competitive applicant field. I did it but it doesn’t matter anymore. It was 9 years ago. Furthermore, college students don’t really have much life experience or have achieved much. I was excellent at community college but below average at university for my new major – math. I could barely keep up and then I got schizophrenia. That was 9 years ago. I’m not even sur
e why I smoked pot. It was like a different version of me, but not really. Something changed. I had a mental breakdown. But something did happen, but no one cares and I rather it just be that way now. I feel like I used to be important or could have been some body but ended up being a random statistic (schizophrenic). There is some doubt on the origin of my schizophrenia like how it happened. I don’t believe it’s solely genetics because I had aliens mess with me constantly in like every life I ever had. I realized and came to the conclusion we live in a computer game (I prefer simulation) and that it keeps restarting or rebooting for me from my perspective after I pass away in the future. It’s like playing Diablo the video game from blizzard on hardcore mode. No progress saved except for me at the year 2011 when I got my schizophrenia. I cannot go back and prevent it. Furthermore, it seems like it has updated and now I wake up or my time loop begins not at 2011 but at 2013 now. It’s sad because I have 
memories before 2011 and it feels real like I was normal and stuff. I think I got a severe case and bad prognosis and low hope. I think things can change. Currently, I’m just doing “research” and educating myself."

175917348,"According to “Terror Management Theory” (which could be called Fear of Death Theory), when we are made to think about our death we strive for “symbolic immortality” that our names live on as “good people”. As a consequence of this, when people are made to think about their death (as opposed to going to the dentist), and asked what they think of someone who steps on their national flag, they become more conservative, right wing, and angry “Don’t step on our flag” because, it is claimed, they want to see themselves and their groups with which they identify as good. Thus terror management theory claims that death tends to make us (or at least Westerners) more intolerant. In Japan however, some claim that the the intolerance effect simply does not exist and others that Japanese instead attempt to increase (not symbolic but) real immortality by forming groups, marriages and having children. There was a higher birthrate after the tsunami for instance. In a sense that shows greater toler
ance. The rest is possibly bunk but…I explain the difference as a function of the modality of self. Westerners tend to think of themselves as their words, and the “I” of their narrative. Linguistic signs are defined in terms of their differences to other linguistic signs so if I or we are good then it implies that others are less so. Japanese may however think of themselves as their faces and enhance themselves not by making distinctions but by for example taking photos of themselves with nice things and places, or imagining their good sides, nice possessions, houses, friends, wives, and children."

I thought I was the chosen one too but it was really hell in my case…have you listened to _NAME_ from Tool? That was about me in a past life/parallel universe.

175917395,"_AT_MENTION_, if you can, try to stop all thoughts that you may be dying. Many times in my life I’ve felt sure I was dying and thankfully I never was and in none of those cases was it ever actually anything serious but my imagination and anxiety caused very minor or even non-existent things to seem major and life-threatening. So please try not to dwell or focus on the lightheadedness for now but do make an appointment to discuss it with a doctor. I think every time I’ve experienced lightheadedness it was due to anxiety or panic attack. It’s one of the most common symptoms and sensations of anxiety and once the anxiety is lessened so is the lightheadedness. Paranoia is intertwined with anxiety, so I’d suggest that for now you attribute your lightheadedness to that but also see what the doctor has to say."

175917400,I would talk to your doctor. Maybe he or she can make some recommendations. My son was in high school when I got sick. He is almost 26 now. I have no experience with watching little ones with sz. I was the one that worked and my wife played Mom everyday. The first six years I was sick and on meds I still worked everyday. I was very undermedicated though and it was hard but I had to do it or we would have been on the street. That has to be hard. Watching little ones I mean.

174332748,"Same. I have a mood disorder. Some days I’m okay like moderate and some days I’m low functioning. I have more low functioning days. I still have intractible delusions, but I rarely if ever hallucinate. I have a thought disorder. Unfortunately, by the very definition of delusion, I believe in them wholeheartedly. Some of them I reject and question now. I cannot remember my life or existence before 2013 so I confabulate unintentionally and have false memories. I believe something very, very, very strange and odd is happening to me in a very, very sick and demented way. All I can say is it feels like a causal loop or time loop that begins practically after high school. I barely remember community college. It’s like I was severely dissociated back then too minus the schizophrenia and I just lacked consciousness like a philosophical zombie. I was probably reincarnated or sent back in time to start my life all over again according to simulation theory and time travel. The times vary. I definitely d
on’t remember attending university between 2010 and 2011. So I’m perpetually schizophrenic and don’t know what it’s like to be otherwise. It’s worse than MK-Ultra. When I dream I am possibly remembering or living in parallel universes for short periods of time or even after my death and I habitually come back to this reality or timeline and I hate it. Unfortunately, I can change history when I go back in time like in the movie “Butterfly Effect” with _NAME_. I think that’s why I have schizophrenia and am being severely messed with and controlled not only by the Power Elite and Players but even ETs. Without upsetting people and sounding controversial, I have memories of dating _NAME_ in a past life. I don’t mean to brag or sound crazy, but it was real in a past life or alternate reality lol. Same thing with _NAME_."

They told me to stop playing video games so I stopped for about 3 months. Didn’t watch TV either, just talked to voices from sun up to sun down. These days I thankfully no longer take commands from my voices. Long story short I do better with roommates/family living with me. I get someone to talk to and it helps me stay connected to reality. Recently I had the apartment to myself for 3 days and got really depressed by the third day."

175917420,"thanks man, I saw an older man on an old motorbike recently and he was wearing a helmet but it looked old skool and he just had jeans and a t-shirt with trainers on, i was like ‘brave man’ he used a hand signal to indicate in front of me and i thought i wonder if i would need to do that, i think bikes have indicators sometimes but idk how noticable they would be. there is a lot to think about."
175917421,What antipsychotic do you take? What are the issues you’re having? How long have you been taking the Cymbalta 60mg?
175917422,"Trust me I know. I started having hallucinations at age 5. It has been a hell of a ride. I have a pretty good support system now. I haven’t always. I thought I have kept it well hidden but turns out I’ve done a pretty bang up job of making people suspicious of me my whole life by withdrawing and being angry for not understanding what was happening to me. I never received the proper coping mechanisms and care. Years of misdiagnosis and my mother confusing my acting out as a form of teenage rebellion instead of my inability to deal with paranoia, delusions and hallucinations. I was scared of the _USER_ID_ so I kept it hidden when I suspected it myself and lack of awareness didn’t help. I have been on anti-psychotics on and off for 25 years."
175917423,I have the 24/7. But some still feel like mine I wish I understood the mind more to see what’s my thoughts and wats not
175917424,Hi. I like your post. There are too many people who discredit those who have knowledge and experience. I have been discredited many times and it just goes to show how people just turn their back on you and don’t give you the time of day.
175917425,I do beading and sewing. I just started beading and I am pretty good at it actually. I want to sell beaded scarves.

175917428,"I was on 6mg of Vraylar. It worked okay, ended up getting akathisia. I had to sleep less while on it, I was on Risperdal before that and that made me sleep 12+ hours a day but I could sleep 7-8 and be fine on Vraylar."
175917429,My psychiatrist feels that I could possibly have schizoaffective bipolar type or bipolar disorder with OCD. She felt comfortable enough diagnosing me with schizoaffective. My therapist feels that I have schizoaffective disorder.
174332753,"I dunno, some days it feels like all the threads have come undone & all I can do is lie in bed searching the ends to put back together. Some days esp when work/school has me on a regular schedule I am feeling very centred & get an exceptional amount of very good & inspired work done. I figure that it all averages out to a typical amount of productivity. If my work weren’t so flexible about my hours idk honestly what I’d do. For the “messy” days my therapist suggests a “bookends” approach. I have a cat so feeding her 2x a day makes for good bookends, but I like it when I can tack on more to it like e.g. take out the trash or have a shower. I’m learning how to not get down on myself for the days when I can only get the bare minimum done. That helps a lot cause when I do it tends to make it worse & I spend more time lost in the noise than if I just allow myself those days & trust that I have enough support in place to guide me back to clarity. I guess fyi I have an sz diagnosis but I don
’t take meds. I have only completely unravelled & lost myself once but it was way before I started to get help for all this. I think if I found myself back in that place for a long time & nothing I could do could help I would def try meds. I dunno if this is helpful…sorry it’s so long! I just wanted to express that I relate."
175917430,Being suspicious is based on reason. You were let down before and your rational mind says it might happen again. You are only protecting yourself.
175917431,"I think I’m gonna try to exercise more because it helps my energy level. But I’m really addicted to this VR exercise thingy. It’s actually just a music rhythm game called Beat Saber and you use lightsabers to smash the blocks coming at you. I’ve been playing the Linkin Park songs recently. I also have a boxing game where you box. It’s called _NAME_. It’s a game based off the movie, so you go through a career, boxing people and moving up in your career."

175917435,"I agree completely, they have a misguided view of what its like. The comparison to drugs is that having sz is like the guy that does LSD and ends it by going out the window because he’s tripping so hard and forgot that he took a drug and he’ll see how he once did like before."
175917436,"I definitely think I could. MAYBE. Like have an appointment every week or so, with all types of sick people. Not everyday with multiple people I can tell you that.

175917440,I’ve had ocd in the past. I still have it ever so slightly. Some of my old rituals were checking doors and switches etc. Checking for spiders around the bed. And it was always at night Since I moved in with my partner I must be feeling more safe and secure cause I havnt had these rituals for over a year now.
175917441,"It’s officially in the cards. I’m going on a 12 day bus tour excursion to 15 states in New England and to Ontario, Canada in the Autumn of 2020. It will be so beautiful there about then. I already have my application and deposit sent in and it was approved! I am so looking forward to this trip. Because I have hardly any family left and I have basically no friends I could go with, I am going alone. It will be really easy because I will be picked up by bus, in my home town, and taken everywhere in New England, by this same bus and back. No transfers or connections. And this tour company arranges all your hotels and meals too. A great arrangement! I decided to put off my trip to Israel at the moment, as my Church has no plans on going there this year yet."

175917447,I think it doesn’t help to get into hobbies if I don’t have someone to enjoy it with.
175917448,Agree. When I was like 16 they gave me old fashioned ECT in a psych ward. Now I look back and think it was so barbaric (it’s different now). But all the stuff I’ve been through has made me the Bad A$$ I am today.
174332752,"That’s great and all but it pisses me off that they focus on 1-2 receptors at at time. How do they even test or know which ones to focus on? Rats and monkeys??? Just a guess. I think they should focus on the root cause or exact cause. My suspicion it is a virus like the noroviurs for example. I may be wrong, but at least I’m trying. They could do much better. It’s not profitable though. You can patent a medication that focuses on 1-2 receptors but you can’t make as much money on a cure. I can’t wait until computers get more powerful and AI gets involved. Maybe open source projects can cure schizophrenia. I think the government can do it and private industry is actually lagging behind a lot. Take SpaceX for example. They think they’re so great but NASA had that technology since the 40s in my opinion. They say private industry does wonders but we all know the government is ahead maybe 40-50 years at least in development and research."

175917452,I was kind. I went out of my way to help people. I was also intelligent and ambitious. I was a good dancer and singer. I wanted to help refugees and orphans. I made good money and my house and car were paid off so I sponsored orphans in China. I was interested in learning languages and learning about other cultures. I always dated men who were wrong for me. Ive always had a hard time making friends.

175917463,Well I’m glad you have this nice back and forth with the advocate but my real question is what’s the deal with your kidney my brother?
175917464,How do you differentiate between criminals+mentally ill and mentally ill only ppl?
175917465,That doesn’t make any sense. Your statement is completely arbitrary. May I suggest you read a few books of political history so you get a better sense of how the real world works? Anyone who has read about the Korean war will immediately understand that they would never recruit foreign nationals to rule over them.

175917472,"I’m sorry you are going through this. I’ve had plenty of physical anxiety symptoms since Covid as well and they are always scary. If the meds make you feel better, that is a good clue that the sensation is being caused by anxiety. Try telling yourself that the doctors have ruled out anything serious, that this is just a sensation that can’t hurt you and that it will pass. It’s so hard, I know, but it will get better."
175917473,I think the problem there would be that it would make the site cliquey. Who decides who is a trusted enough member to get an invite? What happens to the ones who aren’t? We want this to be equal for everyone.

My last job was working for a sports data company and performing work done on a computer. It was super simple and it was 2-3 times a week which was ideal. This job was in person pre-covid, then remote post-covid. Maybe you can look for a remote job. Usually you don’t have a supervisor breathing down your neck and you may have to check in periodically through zoom meetings. That would be a good start, search “remote.”"

I was living by myself in a studio and every night when I was watching TV I would be sitting there by myself fighting for my sanity and always thinking that if it gets much worse I’ll need to go to the hospital.

175917561,"_NAME_ woke me up at 0357. Not enough sleep, given this depression situation. Quite interestingly, my morning coffee, usually my happiest time and event of the day, tastes disgusting to me. It is excellent coffee. It actually does not taste disgusting. It tastes awesome, just not to me wihth my sick brain right now. When I am depressed, my sensory system is profoundly impacted and that includes taste. Food has been incredibly tasteless for a couple weeks. So interesting. This is why people who do not understand depression and think it just means you are sad so totally do not get how all-encompassing it can be for folks who have it super bad, like I have. 27 miles on the bike yest. Absolutely forced myself out there, but it did make me feel a tad better. Lovely day and lots of happy people out and seeing all that did remind me that there is happiness in this world, even if it is hard for me to find and see right now. Will just force myself to do it again today, even though I will not want to at all. 
Exercise has been crucial for me in surviving my depression over the decades. it is why I ran marathons and ultras in the old days. My president is going to drive this nation right into the ground in a giant, flaming wreckage, in typical sociopath fashion.If he cannot win, in his world, then everyone else has to suffer, too.

175917562,"I just had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist. I am back to not sleeping that great but I'm not tired. My brain isn't racing. My thoughts aren't out of control. I'm just not tired. I sleep a few hours then I'm awake, wide awake. My doctor's suggestion was to take the 5mg in morning and 5 mg 8 hours later, not to take it right before bed. See if that changes anything. I did ask about melatonin and he said it was safe but at this point he doesn't want to add it until I change the time of the 2nd dose of buspar. He said there were a few options to tweak things further. If changing the time doesn't help, I can stop the night time dose and take it just once a day. And then take the 2nd dose as needed for anxiety. Or we can stop it completely and take it only as needed. I'm sort of reluctant to stop it completely bc things aren't crazy busy in my brain. I'm sort of feeling... indifferent to anxieties or stressors. I know they are there and I know normally I'd be getting upset but now I'm just sort 
of like... Oh well, let's see how this pans out. Is that good or is that bad? I will note, my thoughts aren't racing at all but they are sort of jumbled. Especially when I'm trying to explain myself. As you can probably tell by the way things are written above."

175917565,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Impulsivity and Comorbid PTSD and Binge Drinking. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, CD _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Journal of dual diagnosis , Apr-Jun 2018 Trauma exposure is common, with estimates of 28% to 90% of adults reporting at least one traumatic event over their lifetime. Those exposed to traumatic events are at risk for alcohol misuse (i.e., binge drinking), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or both. A potential underlying mechanism for this comorbidity is increased impulsivity-the tendency to act rashly. Little work to date has examined the impact of different impulsogenic traits on this comorbidity.This study (n = 162) investigated trauma-exposed young adults (aged 21-30) who had endorsed a lifetime interpersonal trauma. In addition, three impulsogenic traits (motor, nonplanning, and attentional) were measured.Over and above the covariates for age, gender, race, and traumatic events, greater attentional impulsivity was associated with greater li
kelihood of meeting criteria for PTSD and binge drinking, compared to meeting criteria for PTSD, binge drinking, or neither. Neither nonplanning impulsivity nor motor impulsivity exerted unique effects.Young adults who report difficulty attending to immediate stimuli within their environment may be unable to think about and/or process the traumatic event, potentially increasing risk for PTSD and maladaptive coping skills to manage this distress (e.g., alcohol misuse, binge drinking)."

175917629,"^^ Enjoyed reading that. My dreams are usually very realistic visually, but not in structure. My dream self is often different than my waking self; I occasionally dream that my apartment is filled with people, some of whom are roomates, and I don't seem to be bothered by it. I suspect many have a serialized nature; people, places and situations that are familiar and reocurring, but I can't describe any of them because the memory vaporizes upon waking. Perhaps there's a point to the fact that I can't recall any of these people or places in my waking state. Dreams that I do remember are usually analyzed, although the explanations usually point to anxiety. I often feel that I am a mystery to myself. So much thinking goes on during the day, but it all seems so circular compared to dreams, where things seem to open up. I'd love to be able to tap into that but apparently it's not meant to be."

I understood the disease as it was manifested to me starting in 1981. We have come a very long way. It’s been a long road. Now the disease experience is at least partially tolerable with some better drugs. A friend died from suicide about 10 years ago and when they were distributing her belongings, I was given this movie. I was very touched by it. The movie, basically, is true.

I have overcome thought broadcasting before, but somehow I regressed, and I’m experiencing this again. I am not sure when the effects of this higher dosage are supposed to kick in. I am struggling to convince myself that this is a delusion because, it is not simply the belief or suspicion that people can hear my thoughts. But rather, people really say and do things that are congruent to what I think. Like I’ve literally had people repeat my own thoughts to me. People also respond to my thoughts, or questions I have but didn’t say out loud. Since taking the higher dosage, it wasn’t happening so much, but then yesterday, after I had Googled a specific topic regarding my internet business, but dad just randomly brought that particular thing up in conversation shortly after. And he said it the way I’d phrased in Google. I know that these may be coincidences, but all the coincidences sometimes feel a 
little too uncanny. I am trying to convince myself that this isn’t real, but it’s hard when things always seem to validate themselves in this way.

174332797,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Dissecting the functional outcomes of first episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a 10-year follow-up study in the PAFIP cohort. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ Son, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychological medicine , Nov 2019 18 The aim of the current study was to examine the heterogeneity of functional outcomes in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and related clinical, neurocognitive and sociodemographic factors using a cluster analytic approach.A large sample of FEP patients (N = 209) was functionally reassessed 10 years after the first contact with an early intervention service. Multiple baseline, 3-year and 10-year follow-up variables were explored.The cluster analysis emphasized the existence of six independent clusters of functioning: one cluster was normal overall (42.16%), two clusters showed moderate interpersonal (9.63%) or instrumental (12.65%) deficits, two clusters showed more severe interpersonal (
12.05%) or interpersonal and instrumental (13.85%) deficits and there was a significantly overall impaired cluster (9.63%). Cluster comparisons showed that several baseline and follow-up factors were differentially involved in functional outcomes.The current study demonstrated that distinct clusters of functioning in FEP patients can be identified. The fact that a variety of profiles was observed contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the heterogeneity characterizing FEP patients and has clinical implications for developing individualized treatment plans."

I’d be lucky to get a few replies but I’d thought I’d try something different. Some “Delusions” I have or have had: I used to be a computer simulator whose mind was uploaded to a computer by extraterrestrials. I’ve experienced a lot of pain and suffering millions of times over again. More than most people in the universe. I used to be the real _NAME_ aka time traveler in a past life, parallel universe, another dimension, etc. I’ve been cloned. I might not be 100% human. I pass all the DNA tests but my spirit, consciousness, mind, etc. might be ET. I had a feeling or delusion in a past life that I was VALIS or _PERSON_ (haven’t read the books) in a past life. I prefer VALIS over UBIK. I believe in the one true God from the bible. I was more likely a Vampire/or Vampire-ish in a past life over a very weak Reptilian. 
I probably was in the Illuminati in a past life. I believe in aliens and that we live in a computer program. I used to be a time traveler (a lot of this seems redundant and illogical. I know. Makes sense to me!) Experienced mind control I had a delusion (past lives) I was a super soldier, Montauk boy, Monarch victim, etc. Did DMT a billion lifetimes ago and still remember it. Helped write some or most of “_NAME_ Stoned” by Tool in a past life. I’m stuck in a time loop for eternity that starts around 2009-2013 as far as I can tell. Been going on for billions of lifetimes. I’ve escaped before but I keep coming back a lot. I hate it. I have schizophrenia. I can relate to _NAME_ the Illuminati Whistleblower. I have a lot of the same beliefs and paranoia as he does. He seems smarter than me and knows a lot more than I do. I believe in time travel I believe in other realities like this one in which there are countless or near infinite. Haven’t figured it out yet. I’m obsessed with _NAME_ for some unknow
n reason(s). I’ve seen reality change before. I’ve seen _NAME_ win in 2016 in a past life / parallel universe… I’ve been to hell before. Been abducted by aliens before in past lives, but I’ve seen UFOS countless times. I’ve died many times and I keep coming back alive. I think I’m in hell and that there is no heaven. Seen the end of the world many times in my other lives. Hated it. Been immortal before but realized there is no such thing only quasi-immortality. Seen the Riemann Hypothesis in a past life. Currently, unsolved in this life. I really do have some delusions/fantasies/dreams. I believe in Jesus I’m poor Seen the Vampire Dracula…in a past life/parallel universe. Looked like a grey alien… Thank You. Hopefully, this post/thread won’t be locked. If it is, I understand. God Bless."

175917686,"Nagging doesn’t really work though, I guess what I meant was if it really bothered you that much you’d have two options either it would hav been a deal breaker long ago or you’ll just clean up the socks so you aren’t bothered anymore. For example, bf always leaves cabinets and drawers open about an inch for no apparent reason. Ironically his ex wife nagged him about it incessantly so he doesn’t do it at his place. I just shut the drawers after initially confirming there was no reason he left it open. It’s such a tiny thing in the grand scheme so I’m willing to tolerate it. Does that make sense?"

174332805,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ . I think you can count me as a success story. I am not super successful, but my situation has improved significatly after onset of schizophrenia compared to what it was in my childhood and adolescence years,and it can be counted as a huge success because the trajectory of life that is typical for schizophrenics is that after the onset of schizophrenia their situation worsens and they become helpless invalids. For me, I am now more independent than I was in my childhood and adolescence years. My capacity to take care of myself has improved, in particular I started to do stuff like shaving my beard, taking showers and brushing and flossing my teeth which I never did before. I also eat healthier than ever before and strictly control my diet. Cognitively my situation has also improved somewhat. I now do aerobic exercise on exercise machines I have at home, and I plan to start strength training as well. I don’t know if I can hold down a job, but my chances of holding a job are better

175917709,"I can understand that people have to vent, but there are other ways to do it than to put it into hate. Hate is your own worst enemy, it does not affect anyone else than the person who does so. And the price to pay is often depression, bitterness and anger. I rarely get angry, so I can’t really educate people on how to vent, but I remember beating the crap out of a matress I put up towards a wall once, but I didn’t picture anyone, so it was just about getting energy out of the system. I think the reason I don’t get angry though is because there isn’t anyone to blame for my situation. It is what it is. And you can be sure that there will always be someone worse off than you are in this world. It is frustrating to not be able to function like any other person, and it dosen’t help that many of us have to take sedating drugs that impairs our ability to function. But still we are a lot better off than in the days of electroshock theraphy. I take consolation that things are moving forward. Peopl

I had gaps in my employment with no health insurance and was getting free samples from my doctor. The samples ran out and I couldn’t afford my meds. I’d like to work but I need my meds. I can’t afford them when I’m unemployed. My medication is $1200 a month. Stick with it and tough out your paranoia and fears. You’ll come out stronger in the long run.

Its just that I wish to already feel happier, which is not the case still… Maybe its wanting too much, after being ill for soo long… For reconstructing my mind, I try all kind of daily activities here.

I would be a dead walking pharmacy if I had to take a med for all of them… I am from the very ‘‘closed’’ sz I guess and this is hard to heal by the meds… But I have some progress on Zyprexa yeap… I just wish, that I feel happier already now… Or just feel something ‘‘normal’’, not my brain in my head like this in the evenings… But my days are better, yes, don’t get me wrong.

This was 7 months ago and i still do this. But i would say it was a very mild, yet constant form of psychosis that lasted 5 months and nowadays i still sleep with a knife but im slowly taking steps to trust more. Come to think of it I didnt sleep with a knife this whole last week. I just slept on the couch so i felt safe being close to the front door…idk, baby steps. But going off or switching an AP causes psychotic symptoms. Your brain increases dopamine because its trying to make up for the lack. And suddenly it can actually do that so it goes too far and people sometimes have new symptoms or worse symptoms. Its a problem because when someone is misdiagnosed and takes an AP, then goes off, the pdoc just says “see look, you are sz”. APs are as hard core as it gets."

I want to try Vraylar but its not available in Canada. One thing to note about these drugs is that they’re dopamine regulators and not full dopamine blockers. They block dopamines when dopamine is high and they increase dopamine when dopamine is low. Dopamine is important in motivation, emotions, pleasure and cognition; fully blocking it causes negative symptoms generally."

It’s really difficult to get out of that thinking pattern as I don’t know how… It’s like telling someone with psychosis what they thinking is not true. I don’t think all my thinking is right but it FEELS true and I can’t simply change the way I think its really difficult.

But you also got to be prepared to challenge your fears and anxietys head on. And if your not working - start hassling your Shrink for supporting letters to get yourself on Severe Disability Benefits. You shouldnt be suffering on 200 a month. And sorry to say it - I would hold off looking for a woman as well. Concentrate on yourself first. And the rest will naturally follow.

The crippling symptoms I have had were more depression and anxiety and avolition. But my psychosis was mild so I was wondering if it really was. Even though it was there.

174332840,"Psychiatric Times The Psychiatric Pipeline: 10 Agents to Watch There is much to look forward to in the realm of improved treatments for patients with psychiatric illness. I plan to include some of this info when I eventually update that list of medications in the pipeline. Some good info here on how they work. In addition to medication for schizophrenia, there are some interesting drugs that might someday be tried as a sort of regenerative medicine because they increase synaptogenesis. They are currently being studied for depression: NV-5138: Sestrin Modulator In theory, NV-5138 would bypass much of the molecular cascade that is currently necessary to increase brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and ultimately activate mTORC1, hence providing a more direct path to synaptogenesis. This might result in a targeted response with less adverse effects. A single dose of NV-5138, in the required presence of BDNF, resulted in a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant effect in rats by putatively increasin
g synaptogenesis in the mPFC. Hydroxynorketamine Esketamine/ketamine demonstrate antidepressant effects in less than 24 hours. Although their mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated, both likely involve increasing levels of BDNF and ultimately increasing activity of mTOR. mTOR increases protein synthesis at synapses; this in turn increases synaptogenesis, especially in the prefrontal cortex.10 Ketamine is a 50:50 mixture of its 2 enantiomers esketamine and arketamine, both of which are metabolized to hydroxynorketamine. Hydroxynorketamine does not bind to the NMDA glutamate receptor, but rather activates the AMPA glutamate ion channel with downstream effects increasing BDNF and mTOR. Hydroxynorketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant activity in animal models. Since the drug has no abuse potential and no dissociative effects, investigators are studying hydroxynorketamine as a possible ketamine/esketamine alternative."

When I previously had a Community Psychiatric Nurse regularly visiting me he said that from my description some of them could be termed “psychotic dreams” but I don’t know whether that’s an accepted term in psychiatry.

I accessed the app on my Xbox but it’s on Amazon fire stick, Apple TV, roku, whatever u have and probably on the web too. You don’t even need to sign up to watch the movies. But u do need to sign up to save movies to a watch list. Otherwise, you’re good! Happy bingeing, (Healthily)!"

175917916,Children have to have a sense of obeying their parents for their own safety. But problems come up with the child wanting to rebel when parents are too controlling and children miss out on experiencing life.
175917917,I’m still below the therapeutic range so once I get on a higher dose I guess things could change. I see my pdoc in 3 weeks

175917921,"So I have some mystery pain in my abdomen that is keeping me immobile at the moment. They can’t figure out what it is. I’m on Meloxicam, Tylenol and tramadol. My doctor thought it was nerves enervating from my lower back, but I’ve been doing PT and all it does is aggravate the pain. I did my exercises yesterday afternoon and it was a big mistake. So I’m in bed all day. I’ll probably be on the forum as well. What is everyone else up to?"

175917937,"My apologies _AT_MENTION_ , I mistook fMRI for the EEG of my brain. But for your information, I believe that the EEG shows much of the brain waves as shown in fMRI. For me, my brain waves were not normal. It was not regulated by the time I was tested. The test then was colour-mapped, and the results were shown to my parents and I. We were saying to ourselves, “no wonder _NAME_ has these symptoms”. Hopefully in the morning I could send you one of the reports that showed my abnormal conditions at that time."

175917941,"I did, because I’m a male. It was extra classes, but they’ll often double male nurses as first line security in high risk positions. I learned proper holds that wouldn’t harm the patient, and disable them until security and more help could come. Tying bed post restraints and using jackets and blankets. Proper legal requirements and orders for use. Tactics on what to do if they have weapons It’s crappy, but has to be done sometimes."

175917956,"has she ever been on meds for this? sounds like she wouldnt go on them if she doesn't accept theres something wrong. as for going into hospital, it really helped me (i didnt want to go, i was 'sectioned' ie forced). my experience of a mental hospital, although initially i was afraid, was overall a good experience. if she is not a danger to herself or to others then being forced into hospital cannot happen (atleast in the UK)."
175917957,I’ve had 3 of my doctor’s offices call to tell me that since I’m high risk I shouldn’t do this long list of things. Pretty much they just don’t want me to leave the house unless it’s an emergency. It’s made this feel a lot more real and scary.

175917963,"I have a very odd problem, it’s contrary to what most people struggle with. I have a weaker sense of self to begin with because it’s not distinct. There is no self. I have no definition. No “this is where I end and you begin”, it’s weird because I’m not a borderline or something. I had a very scary experience last week that’s very much like what you describe with your experiences on drugs, that apparently yep it wasn’t in my head ... I was going along last week like normal but I had some kind of psychotic episode and ugh ... it was like I never lived ... there is no “I”, no emphasis ... I wish I had an “I”, it ****s things up, I’m so dissociative but I can’t even have DID. I can’t have a personality disorder because I have no personhood. It’s weird. Nothing there. I’m like a ghost. I know I’m crazy but I’m also right."
175917964,What would be the point? Who cares if someone disrespects you? It’s not illegal.
175917965,I don’t know about weed being physically addictive or nit but I used to crave that weed buzz for the whole day it’s like even if I have to take a bath I should be high. It was to such a point that I was smoking 6 7 joints a day big ass joints. So I think it can become a physical craving… don’t you think. Please correct me if I am wrong.

175917968,"I would hope you have a better experience than I did of community services in 2003 when I was 17, as things seemed to have gotten better since then, but geography unfortunately plays a part in treatment being a bit of a lottery on where you live. Anyway. My advice to you is keep taking any support you get and work through this. I hope you don’t have a second episode, but time will tell. Keep going and build a good life for yourself. It’s not inevitable it will come back. Even if it does, inner strength can play a really significant part in anyones recovery and functioning."
175917969,I can relate because I went through this process myself … it was the only thing I would think about and it was difficult to see things clearly or think about other things … but in time I learned to be more accepting of my illness… im sorry it must be exhausting and difficult and it must feel like your mind won’t stop thinking into it
175917970,"Not everyone with autism will makes lots of threads every day. Also, you’re not getting the “right answer” because it’s not the right answer, it’s just what you want to hear. You want us to tell you that you don’t need meds, but you do."

175917972,"What triggered you this time? Are you watching something you shouldn’t or reading something? And like I said before, does it all matter? Because I used to get so much panic and fear and attacks from this delusion. But to me it’s very real. I would say I even was chosen to be one of those programmers in a past life. I mentioned it before here. People say it’s not real. Have you ever felt that way? I would say the programmers are sick themselves. I was one of the good ones. I know a lot about simulation theory, but I don’t have the mathematical abilities or programming abilities or whatnot to actually prove it concretely but then again nobody does. Might take 100 + years to figure it all out. I bet you it will be physicists that will do it."

I got a ways to go on it yet. About my recording myself: I tried it and it sounds tinny and terrible video recording from my smartphone. My teacher says I don’t have the right recording equipment. And I don’t know how to get it. When I recorded my albums, I used a professional recording studio."
175917974,Wonder what’s up with my vibration because the people I seem to attract and be attracted to don’t seem to care about animals. The ones that care about animals seem hateful at me for wearing second hand leather. Maybe I don’t understand the vibration thing or what is up with that. Better to stand alone for something so important anyway than not stand.

175917976,I had a dream that I went to a music festival. The music was really good in this dream. The US was running out of oil and the world economy was collapsing. The world was dying because people used so much toilet paper for some reason. I was awake for 2 days in my dream because I didn't take the zopiclone. So I was staying up in my grandmothers house watching news reporters talking about regular people giving injections to people with disabilities because it was cheaper than nurses..

175917979,"It’s difficult to tell how far I’ve come. All I know is in 1982,before I met my wife in psych hospital, I was seen at best as suitable for a group home and at worst a long stay ward. I left psych hospital with my future wife in 1983 and have not been an inpatient since then. I live independently with quite a lot of support,that may seem as though I’ve not come far - but compared to how badly I was doing when first a psych patient (over a dozen hospitalisations between 1975-1983) I have."

I feel like im on a fake internet too like this message board is fake. I wouldnt want to go to other sites. Even youtube is mostly positive. I think either ai, censorship, or my schizophrenia or even the wrong crowd. Im paranoid about blm and antifa now. Mainly because of this site. People get hacked, doxxed, and stuff. I post stuff I feel is real and could be misconstrued the wrong way. Therapy doesn’t help. Feels like a conspiracy theory. I have real memories and fears. I legitimately know im bat ???? insane. I dont want to be taken advantage of. I dont want people to believe me either. My mind is literally ?????? up. I worry about aliens and milabs too. I worry about my family. I dont think schizophrenics will go extinct or get targeted at all. Maybe less benefits, that’s why i think something is weird about my life. I dont think we are going to 
live under fascism or communism in my life, hopefully. I get really scared. But the bible talks about this. A lot of schizophrenics believe we are in end times as well as religious folks…(feels extremely real to me, guys) I have to live with integrity and be good and nice."

I have hpv and am a high risk for getting cancer and I have abnormal bleeding and drama and my uterus will only cause me problems now. I just had a colposcopy ,hystoscopy and biopsy yesterday a to see if I have cancer. I get my results in two weeks approximately. I know it’s a painful procedure but I am such a high risk for cancer there and I just don’t want those problems and have been supported by doctors to have my uterus removed. Hopefully I have not got cancer but even if I don’t I still want to remove it to lessen my chances and to stop abnormal bleeding etc"

175917995,"I have that at times… i just think it doesnt really help you to think about it. At least for me a preoccupation with such themes means im unwell and i need to somehow steer away from it. The times i am most healthy and well are the times i do the type of things i just wrote. Boardgames help too, or learning something new, or anything really where i can focus all this attention on something “normal”."
175917996,"She shot me down real quick, said she doesn’t want me to get it in my head that taking a pill can fix my problems…isnt that why she put me on a third antipsychotic? I’m having a hard time rationalizing her argument. But whatever, just have to suffer anxiety I guess"

But now I am thinking of getting a Degree in Information Technology or Information Systems. I wanna have a career in something that I can do with computers or computer management. Is it possible for a schizophrenic to go to uni, sit through the lectures, comprehend the slides and get a degree certificate? What about distance learning? Is that easier or at least easier on the stress levels?"

175918006,a lot of aspies are smart and do well with computers. congrats.
175918007,If your on these meds do it! It’s a no brainer to the older people who’ve been on them long. Biggest complaint about antipsychotics is they make you gain weight and that brings other things into the equation like less lifespan.
175918008,"i think you do though. reason i think that is because i dont mind my voice sometimes, BUT when i try to sing it comes out unplesant ((Sad)), but your singing voice doesn’t come out unpleasant so that is lucky. wat do you mean by ego trippin?"

175918016,I experimented a lot with drugs. Otherwise my life is the same. I just need hospital every once in awhile.

175918017,"The patients in this study were early course, however there have been papers with good results on chronically hospitalized patients as well. In the other papers I have read, it may benefit most but not all, and some of the authors have hypothesized that in the patients who do not benefit there is some difference causing reduced plasticity compared to those who did benefit."

175918027,"SO my week has been easily a 10. I am riding my bike to work, since it’s been rainy as usual in these parts. My scooter is a fair weather ride. I’m loving my job, and done with training. My trainer said once this other guy leaves I’ll be the top guy. Awesome! I figure school is in my 5 year plan, since I have a bunch of student loans to pay off. And to foot the bill, a dui charge. Luckily no jail! Routine excercise will be in my one year plan. I miss high endurance and strength sometimes. But my job keeps me pretty active. It is the most fast paced job on campus. Not that bad!"
175918028,"I’ve communicated in my mind with them before, and it was sort of like I had an argument in my own mind if that’s what you’re saying? And of course it was making me mad at other people too, even though it was full on delusional"

175918030,"I was on my way home from the library and I got distracted by the car next to me and I ran into a _NAME_ in front of me! I was only going 5 miles per hour but it was a nice solid hit. But I immediately started to get out of my car to look at the damage and exchange information with the other driver but for some reason the person just drove away. So I followed him a little ways but he/she/it wouldn’t stop and then they pulled away fast. Then I thought “Screw it, I tried to do the right thing but if they’re going to just drive away I’m going to just get out of it and leave.” And then they made a left turn and I just kept going straight. I never had that happen before. Maybe they were drunk or on drugs."

175918034,I remember my dad pretending to leave me behind once by him jumping on the back of a train and me watching helplessly. That was mean. I was crying I think. I must have been 6 at the oldest.
175918035,"All is really relaxed here. I dont feel there are excessive measures. I dont know any people in risk groups, so im not really worried. But i would actually like a bit more information on what is and isnt a good way to deal with it. The only things i notice now is the 1.5m distance (which i try to keep, but many dont), masks in trains, screens in some places and hand disinfection in entrances of shops etc. I dont mind those."
175918036,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ . Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer Moderator"
175918037,"My mom isn't so good to me. She can be emotionally abusive most of the time. She treats me like a slave. Makes me feel like I'm not worth anything other than waiting on her hand and foot. I have to do it because she provides a roof over my head and food for me to eat. It's hard to deal with. She's never laid a hand on me. But she might as well have. The emotional stuff caused just as much damage. She's a narcissist. Clinically. Diagnosable. She'd never admit she did anything wrong, though. She thinks she's helping me. She thinks giving me a big birthday and big Christmas makes up for the rest of the year of treating me like ****."
175918038,"Interesting research. “The scenarios were broad enough so that each participant would reimagine them differently. For example, when researchers asked volunteers to vividly remember and describe an occasion involving dancing, one person might recall watching their daughter participating in a dance recital, while another may imaging themselves dancing at a Bar Mitzvah.” What I would have preferred is participants trying to describe and reimagine the same scenarios (an activity that all participants would be submitted to the same way, for example) rather than asking them to recall something broader as they’ve done. So it seems to me that we would have more precise information on how the brain interpret a given scenario, by comparing more similar information."
175918039,You lack insight into why you’re doctor is telling you this. The guy has more than 8 years of education including how to diagnose people and dispense medication. He probably has many years of experience of being a practicing psychiatrist. I’m trying to say that maybe his opinion might be worth something.

175918056,I'm pretty sure my therapist uses CBT but I haven't asked directly about it before. I'll have to see if we can start working on my fears with food and pills next time we talk. I honestly forgot to mention it today because in other ways I'm doing really well and I was focused on that more than my anxiety so I didn't bring it up. Thanks SP!

Then 50 people comment in agreement, and 3-4 say they are wrong. I find it very unsettling that so many people are not taking this seriously, and putting the sick and elderly at risk. I try to open their eyes, but they don't want them opened. They think I'm the one that needs to open her eyes. Yesterday it all just got to me. Thankyou. I hope you are doing well and you stay safe.

174332893,"Okay, say you take a global approach, the cells go specifically to the weakest areas in the brain, even the ischemically prone regions and multipley from there outward. as a result new networks are made, with branch points stemming from the overstimulated as well as understimulated regions. then nutrient supply typically in the form of neurotransmitters becomes scarse unless supplemented. This shapes the extent of the synchronous pathways. As a result, the patient wll begin to experience new styles f thinking typically in the manifestation of symptoms, confusion of illicit thinking. Then the 2-9 months following, if the patient undergoes cognitive behavior therapy to ‘reshape’ the cognitive patterns, the networks engrained with take presedence of the older network patterns and sequence patterns through repition . from this higher levels of thinking manifest to structure personalities emotions and personalities. Thereby giving the chance to reexpress current shortcomingings typically expressed a
s negative symptoms. while simultaniously the positive symptoms limited by the Ldopa precoursers begin to establish new peramitors of threshold and thus the new style of thinking further engrains itself in the the fruedism of thought unique to that patient. As you have to remember, you can never wipe a memory you can only rewrite over it much like that of how a computer operates.So a complementary focused therpay results in cognitive alterations on a chemoreceptive level. Thereby the global approach fine tunes the nonglobal manifestations."

175918071,Comedy I think I would love to be successful and have career in. Not stand up though. I might also like some care work sometimes for animals and people but only clients I say yes to and times etc. Occasionally stand n work in kitchen and fast food and cafe just for fun but only on occasion and only with people I choose to work with. It’s very important who I work with I can’t work with all people. I can’t work with most people as they give of hateful vibes to me. I wanted to be a Dr when I was a child. A surgeon every blue moon perhaps. I would try directing because my mum said I would be great at it. Lots of great jobs to enjoy but I would want a agent. To help me with work and I say yes or no and who work with etc I’m happy on pension as I can’t stand to be around most people. They get jealous of me n hate on me etc or bully me etc I need to be alone in bed and on pension but I have enjoyed working and have done good work even sometimes and even got a kick at lunch rush at take away. The

175918072,I had the tv and radio talk about me last year for about a week straight it was hell untill I went into the mental hospital were then it stopped and was able to watch tv regularly again
175918073,I'm feeling good today. I think finally I got a med combination that works and doesn't completely drag all of my energy. It makes this last trip to the hospital worth it or at least for now.
175918074,Exercise deff helps with size no steroid use or other drugs though just natural.
175918075,That’s a very negative thing for your doctor to say. They should be empathetic. If it helps I have no sex drive either. These meds must affect that part of the brain.
175918076,"Hey there, I've had pretty bad anxiety my whole life and was diagnosed just recently with panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I'm currently only taking Xanax. I can go weeks without a panic attack and then (for example this week), I can begin to have them every day, often multiple times. I am relatively familiar with panic attacks and their symptoms but lately a new symptom has flown to the forefront: shortness of breath. I know this is very common but for me, breathing has never been an issue. Now when I panic, I feel like I can't take a deep breath and I'm not getting enough oxygen or am being choked or suffocated and constantly checking my face and fingernails for any signs of blueness (that last one is a bit absurd, I know). It's pretty terrifying. I've already been to urgent care and the doctor in the last two days and my oxygen level is at 100% and my lungs sound totally clear (still waiting on lung x-ray results) and I was even given an inhaler. I'm convinced I have something el
se going on (health anxiety!) and can't seem to attribute the shortness of breath to anxiety alone--which I also understand is a symptom of health anxiety. What a vicious cycle! I am curious what folks do to help with shortness of breath, how you ease the terror, or even practices that have truly worked and helped with this scary panic symptom. Any thoughts appreciated D"

When I got back I was very depressed so I got ketamine infusions for my depression. I had 5 infusions some of the infusions were very scary.

175918116,Happy birthday
175918117,"Dude I like it but that’s flaggable on so many levels. God, drugs, ripe dikes."
175918118,"How many 500mg pills do you take? It says 6/day on the bottle, its too much. 6 one shot? I took 3."
175918119,"I started my diet 9 days ago, I’m down to 236. I’ve lost 4 pounds. I’m pretty happy with that."
175918120,"Hey, you stole my pick up line when I go to bars. Just kidding. But on behalf of everybody, I say thanks! It’s a nice sentiment."
175918121,Glad your psyche was able to help. Be well
175918122,"The doc is slowly getting me up. I’m currently on 5mg Lexapro (going down), 10mg abilify (going up), and 80mg Latuda. We’re playing by ear how to medicate me."
175918123,"Heya leaf! Wishing you well. How’s the new year treating you? I’m making more tamales today, we’re giving a batch to our employees for all the hard work they do for my family. Kind of a late newyears present, to go along with their prime ribs and holiday bonuses. Gonna have to make about 150 is everyone is going to get some, have 5 people working on them at once, shouldn’t take long. Other than that, just combatting my own brain on a daily basis,"
174332910,"I do have moderate cognitive symptoms, they were my first cognitive symptoms, started at 10 y.o. I am supposed to be a Dr now and I was close, had the grades. But my grades gradually went down from 90+% average to 70%. I ended up having a physiotherapy major university degree with a 3.1 GPA, down from 4/4.3 GPA. 3.8+ was needed for medschool."
175918124,Today I really tried to stay at home… Unusual for me…
175918125,"I bought some today for sleep, 3 mg. Anyone have any success stories with it?"
175918126,"just got home from.the hospital, here’s a couple paintings IMG_20200109_222214_9381932×2415 1.45 MB IMG_20200109_114138_9111932×2415 1.21 MB IMG_20200112_043211_9151552×1940 554 KB IMG_20200112_050155_2711820×2275 846 KB"
175918127,You won’t quit? Or you won’t start anymore trouble?
175918128,That’s great news! I’ve been off alcohol for two years and three months.
174332913,Actually 4 1/2 years it’s really helped me. I was in bad shape in 2014-15 before the naltrexone and it’s revitalized me a great bit but I still have work to do. I already quit alcohol with help from naltrexone. Hppd and cognitive issues are helped For me by naltrexone. I was in bad shape after a bad experience in may of 2014. I never had much cognitive issues before until I had the mishap. Meds and shrooms shouldn’t be mixed together. And that fd me up real bad and now I’m almost back to where I was cognitively. But I gotta use healthier habits with marijuana/cannabis. I know it’s bad for most schizos. Well I know it doesn’t help with the negative symptoms for me. And too much doesn’t help with the positive symptoms usually either. And it’s hard to balance it so I promised I’m quitting when I run out.
175918129,Good job on reporting that!
174332914,"I’m not sure because I may have also prodromal schizophrenia, but in my experience schizoid symptoms got better with treatment."
174332909,"I always get my medication from my local pharmacy, but I’ll check out other places."
175918130,"Put headphones and use the anxiety to speed up your walking, then go home and relax…"
174332911,"My weight has fluctuated +/- 35 kilos 3 or 4 times since being diagnosed. I hope this time I have now just lost 26 kilos and have a normal BMI due to lifestyle changes it will stick. Dieting for me has always been taken to the extremes, and the lost weight has always come back. Nothing like some back breaking labour to trim down I guess! I don’t think it’s good to be losing and then gaining so rapidly. AP’s have definitely caused this, which is why I minimise weight gain risk by my choice of meds"
175918131,"Hmm, the Keebler elves must be spying me on because _NAME_ just sent me an EMail saying my laptop shipped (3 weeks early.) Bless their wholesome hearts. Maybe... I'm praying to the wrong gods... _USER_ID_"
175918132,"Hi HT, I imagine that when you posted your day was going on. Now you would most likely be sleeping. I hope that your night goes well and that you have a good day tomorrow. I hope your scooter comes soon. I know you are patiently waiting for the day to come. Hugs, _NAME_..."
174332915,"I was talking in terms of being on a psychosis spectrum, with extremely psychotic non responders to Clozapine at the most severe end. The autism and sz/sz-a means I’ve never lived a life, functioning wise, that matches that of an average person of my age & intelligence."
175918133,Sugar and caffeine
175918134,Here’s a thread to gather all my doodles!
175918135,Glad it went good do you enjoy your job.
175918136,Has anyone on the boards gotten diabetes from an AP?
175918137,"Or I can just tell my mom to prepare me to move out. I really want to move out. She hasn't taught me how to cook. She just never let her teach me even when I asked ""I can do it for you"". I went to the independent living unit but I was too sick and being treated with a lot of meds."
175918138,"In some ways it was excellent, and in other ways not too good. Mental illness hasn’t changed that."
175918139,"Not a writer but I experienced the same thing while studying in university. It hurt my grades a lot. I feel everyone on earth is watching me even when pleasuring myself and I get negative voices while studying like you’re stupid, junky, useless, coward, you don’t deserve studying, studying is cheating, people are better than you and will beat you no matter how much you study etc Very insulting and disturbing voices. I know its very hard but I still managed to barely pass my remaining courses and get a degree in physiotherapy. I would have been accepted in medicine with my preSZ grades if I didn’t had those voices which was my dream."
175918140,You’re strong You can handle this Make today a good day Enjoy it Don’t feel guilt I love you
175918141,Interacting with the voices is a sign that my psychosis is taking a toll on me.
175918142,But we need each other. It becomes a question of do you bounce around or do you get kicked around?
175918143,"I didn’t want to. Like I said in OP ‘them’ made me. She was female, which was cool. But then I got some old guy for a pdoc when I was discharged from the hospital."
175918144,What color would you get?
175918145,"Thanks, _NAME_. I don't know the name of the group that will be performing at the market. And I don't know how good they are either. But I'll find out either way tomorrow if I choose to go to the market."

175918147,"My friend overdosed on drugs a month ago. Opiates are the only thing that make me feel normal besides anti psychotics those kind of put me in a haze sometimes… I feel terrible after my friends death because we were using drugs together. Right now I am taking suboxone which I got illegally I know I could easily go to a clinic and get on suboxone maintenance if I can find a place that would take insurance. I would probably have to tell my parents though and my mom would be upset. I am fairly high functioning for someone who is often psychotic. I am going to community college and after the class I am taking this summer I have 24 credits left until I get my associates. I only took 3 classes last semester but I got all A’s even though I was high for the majority of it including my psych final which I aced. I don’t know how to live without taking drugs wether it’s prescribed (anti psychotics and lyrica) or illegal drugs like oxycodone, raw h, suboxone. I realize all my desires cause suffering my 
desire to get high led to one of my close friends dying I only have two left who I rarely see because I isolate myself. Sometimes when people text me I just make up an excuse it’s hard to make plans when I don’t know wether I’ll be psychotic or not that day. Life is so hard and I feel like ????."
175918148,"I hate lack of emotion!! My emotions vary from day to day. There are days when I feel apathy (usually if I forgot to drink caffeine) and sometimes I don’t feel emotional when I’m supposed to. For me it’s never 100% emotionlessness. I’m always able to feel something. There’s always something that will make me feel better like work, friends, the wind or a smell, music, or even just a quiet feeling."
175918149,I tend to agree if it seems too good to be true somethings going on.
175918150,Life has been good for me this year. I turned 30 earlier this year. My 20’s were bad and miserable. I don’t know why this year has been so good.
175918151,"I just feel tired. From work, studying, my recent bout of mania, my OCD flare up. Every time I use the washroom I have to wash my hands five times and also wash my face. It’s tiring but I can’t not do it. I’m just getting tired of one thing or another popping up. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
174332919,I was on it for sleep also but I had to come off as it was making me angry on 50mg and sedated on 300 abilify gets rid of my paranoia but only abilify maintena not normal abilify normal abilify makes me anxious and shaky abilify maintena works but works too well for me. In the sense that it takes away my creativity
175918152,"It’s a hard question. If SCZ and Bipolar are more solidly defined the question would probably answer itself. Despite knowing they’re chemical imbalances of the brain, classification and diagnosis of SCZ & bipolar are still done using psychiatric symptoms. If, for example, we can prove SCZ correlates to a certain neurochemical signature and Bipolar corresponds to the same (yet less perturbed) signature, the answer would be obvious."
175918153,When it’s happening it feels real… and people start acting differently towards me or seem to get upset when certain thoughts pop into my head. I am working on strengthening my concentration and my self control … also working on lowering my medication because I don’t want to be on them.
175918154,It would help a lot if she can live with someone or a family member.
175918155,I have tried breathing exercises but it doesn’t help
175918156,This topic was automatically closed 7 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.
174332924,Nice that you have the motivation. I have SZ with negative symptoms and I gained 150lb since I was put on antipsychotics.
175918157,The olanzepine and weed last night must have made me feel much better this morning. And this is the first time in 10 days that I woke up in the morning instead of the afternoon.
174332923,what were the details that were involved?
175918158,Finally is sarcosine safer ? Is sarcosine related to prostate cancer OR all the cancers? Because there is chance ( 95 % ) to survive with prostate cancer. What do you think about it ? Also it acts like co-carcinogen . What does it mean ??? ( pratically ? ) There are some reasons to have a cancer and this combination of factors creates the cancer or NO?
175918159,how did it help you?
174332918,"Well, I don’t really hear voices, but my most bizarre thought is they are transferring my consciousness to different parallel earths and that I keep reincarnating into a schizophrenic body (my original body) in a life that is pretty much exactly and always exactly the same and that starts around the same year – 2013. I sometimes think the human brain can hold multiple souls or consciousnesses and can go multi-dimensional because that’s how I can only make sense of it. People that I know have seen me since I was born (my family) yet I was somewhere else living billions of other lives – some exactly like this. It makes time really weird like there could be more than 1 dimension of time or some crap. In my past, I’ve been to the past, present, and future. The past seemed fake but then again this is another one of my pasts. I remember going to the future and ???? looked exactly the same. Buildings and technology that is. Some things are different. I think I’m being punished for various reas
ons or maybe I agreed to have schizophrenia for a bigger, grander purpose – something like self-sacrifice or some bullcrap. I believe we live in a computer simulation run by extraterrestrials or advanced human beings. I’ve seen them because I knew them at one time. The only other explanation I have is that I was killed somehow in this life and this person I am now is just a clone or doppelganger from another reality or earth or some crazy ass ????! It’s so crazy and wild and advanced I have not ever figured it out I guess. I sometimes think reality is worse than the TV show Westworld but then again that’s my own personal bias."
175918160,Every time I’ve lived alone I’ve had a big thing of psychosis. I never leave the house.
175918161,I hope you meet some cool people in there! That was one of my favourite parts.
174332925,I’m quite normal on meds. But I will never be sure what really happened when I got sick first time.
175918162,I used it. It didn’t have any problems for me. I switched to oral risperidone dose because now I have tardive dyskinesia and needed to taper/lower my antipsychotic dose.
175918163,"Iam starting to question the Global Mental Health system who seem to think that having SZ is an uncurable disease, that you can’t achieve things,meet your full potential and that the majority of people with the condition have lower IQ’s than the average _NAME_!.I could not disagree more, I myself run a Online Business started from scratch with next too no money,can speak multiple languages and iam planning on doing a degree.Anyone here have any thoughts on this subject?"
175918164,"I have absolutely no problem with wearing a mask when I'm near others for the safety of others. If I didn't wear a mask and also didn't stay six feet from others, that would be inconsiderate and dangerous on my part. The last thing I want to do is make someone else sick. Why would I want to do that for?"
175918165,Yes I did.

174332921,I take clozapine 300 mg I had to start taking it all at night because it was making me a zombie. I Also take lithium 600 mg at night. Ever since I started taking all my meds at night my days have been a lot better.
175918167,I just want to end my life. Nothing can get better. Everything hurts and nothing can change. My life is rubbish. I just want to end this pain.
175918168,Maybe God created the universe and died of old age.
174332929,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effects of chronic physical illness on treatment outcomes among patients with schizophrenia. I Šimunovi? _PERSON_?i?, _PERSON_? and I Filip?i?, Current opinion in psychiatry , Jun 2019 04 Previous research has demonstrated the high prevalence of medical comorbidity and multimorbidity among patients with schizophrenia. However, little is known regarding the potential effects of chronic physical illness (CPI) on schizophrenia treatment outcomes. In the present report, we aim to provide an updated review of the relevant literature.We searched MEDLINE for studies published between 2017 and 2018. After screening 683 articles, we included six studies of adequate quality. Five of these studies reported significant associations between several CPIs and different schizophrenia treatment outcomes, whereas the remaining study did not. Significant effects were low to moderate in size. CPIs with significant effects on treatment outcomes included metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and 
asthma. No significant effects were observed for diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or lung conditions. One study reported a significant association between the total number of CPIs and the overall number of psychiatric rehospitalizations.In addition to increasing the risk of premature mortality, accumulating evidence indicates that various CPIs affect schizophrenia treatment outcomes. Thus, researchers and healthcare practitioners should increase efforts to raise awareness regarding the importance of physical health among patients with schizophrenia. Further high-quality studies are required, particularly those targeting the potential effects of individual CPIs."
174332930,I suppose I accepted it in my early 20’s when I wasn’t really symptomatic. Then in my mid 20’s when I was symptomatic I believed I had depression and anxiety which I told my fiance. My original diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder I think it still is last I knew.
175918169,"Well, while that may not seem ideal to you... people crave a family/relationship.... to feel not so alone in this world. I know I crave a relationship. Not so much starting a family but because I'm lonely and want a S/O I can share my life with. My given family isn't the most comforting. I'm lonely. I'm alone without the internet."
175918170,"I thought it's been only a few years.. I'm sorry SP.. I know you've been doing brain games and everything you could do to work your brain muscles to prevent them from deteriorating.. From what I recall you're personality is more sensing than intuitive? Try going out of your comfort zone and think about the future, technology, the world, innovative ideas.. It could make you a little psychotic though so idk... I would just keep trying and not to give up. Caffeine helps a bit.. Organizing the mind.. It's cool that you draw and paint like ISFP.. I love your drawings =]"

175918172,Sure that overmedication is not a good thing except for the pocket of Big Pharma.
175918173,Happy birthday! All that is important is that you count your blessings and be kind to yourself.
175918174,"I did a lot of fundraising at my job and that’s sort of like sales. I loved it, but I’m an extrovert by nature. I was raised by a salesman, and I grew up knowing little tricks to get people to buy whatever crap I had to sell for school fundraisers. I was always a top seller. You have to have pretty good self esteem or else be really good at faking it, because you’ll get told no a whole bunch. And then you just have to shake it off and pitch to the next person, and still act confident. It’s definitely a trial by fire kind of job to have. And meeting quotas can be stressful."
174332926,Its like if refusing meds is part of my positive symptoms.
175918175,"I like LoneCuteCat's comment on the thread below about having a castle that you live in, your inner world. It's similar to _NAME_ concept of an inner citadel. What does your inner world look like? I'm debating between going within and maybe focusing on a bright object in the center of the belly or spending about 90% of my life online like another schizoid does. I'm leaning towards the latter. Thoughts?"
175918176,What meds do you take?
174332928,"Hi peeps! While I was listening to Pandora, this ad came up about SZ. I was super-suprised, as this is the first time I’ve heard anything SZ-related on this app. It was talking about once-monthly injections, specifically Invega Sustena, and I thought maybe it would be of interest for some of us: oncemonthlydifference.com Uncover a Once-Monthly Injection for Your Schizophrenia Treatment Kind of nice hearing an ad representing us… Maybe those algorithms are working after all"
175918177,"What number am I saying right now? If you have voices, tell me what number its saying."
175918178,Yeah pretty regularly. That when I died they’d take me to hell and make me into one of satan’s whores. Lovely.
175918179,I was like that for a long time. I’m slowly coming around though.
175918180,Hey... what’s up?
174332927,The lowest dose? I don’t want it to be so high Are there lower doses? He thought this was the lowest dose and messed up…
175918181,Does it help you with paranoia at all? Im thinking of the shot as i tend to go off my meds constantly.
175918182,Welcome to the forum! Antipsychotics have helped me in some aspects but not others. I think it’s the standard care for psychosis because it works better than anything else. I don’t think schizophrenia runs it’s course and stops for good. I think it’s life long
175918183,clean clothes laundry ate fruit salad for breakfast plenty of liquids
175918184,"Hi, this is about the only reason I came here and i hope I get some answers at least, so I'll try to make it worthwhile and easy for all of us. I don't want my real name out there, so if you need to refer to me you can just call me one. My childhood wasn't awful, but I don't have a hard time being upset over it. That being said, I think I've been repressing/ignoring a fair amount of my feelings and reactions to it for a long time now. My head isn't exactly on right, in a lot of horrible ways that i am not happy with but I also haven't had to change because it's rarely in the public eye. I'll only be touching on one of my problems for the most part as its something that i can't help or shove away. For a year or so (maybe longer, but i have a really bad memory) ive been having a rough time with recognizing myself. I always look new to my eyes, and sometimes I feel new too. I think I'm delusional. It's a weird thing to describe but I don't view myself as a person anymore. moreso different feelings. I'
ve had a hard time with my thoughts and imagination for as long as i can remember, while some people can conjure something in their head, i get the idea while the signals fall short. I'm not sure if I've had the wrong idea about other peoples thoughts for so long, but I do believe that im out of the ordinary in that regard, and I think the days where I believed it with no self reflection or positivity caused a disconnect in my head. Everything is ""Future one, little one, happy one, snarky one-"" and so forth. I refer to myself in the third person and talk through things outloud to myself, or I can't think at all. I tried looking around, I don't think its anywhere near Dissociative Identity Disorder. While my memory is bad, its more retaining information. im aware things happened and time has passed, but im bad at recalling specifics, if any event. I also read that many of them have a headspace, and i definitely don't have that. My head is nothing but empty space, no matter how much i try. But these fragments
, while all ""me"" seem like nothing but strangers with their specific roles and personalities. like workers and bots. Making sure i run right and process information as well as i can. Nothing horribly traumatic ever happened to me, overbearingness was turned into neglect and resentment, ft. a fair amount of drunk accidents and crying siblings... but i feel thats just how most kids live. the world is a terrifying place filled with unhappy and uncaring people, no matter how much those people may try to force themselves to be different. With nothing overly sick happening to me, but still being in a rough place, I have a chore like dishing of ptsd, depression, and paranoia, and i was in therapy for it. but I could never truly say what i could feel during it, it all seemed to crazy to me. too far gone. I didn't want to be beyond help, I still function. So I stopped going. But now i can't get any answers. is there anything i can use to get a better grasp on this? is it just plain delusions? a coping mechanism that
s just maybe doing a bit more harm right now than good? or is a disorder i need help with? and... maybe just a little more food for thought. If it is a coping mechanism that im overly worried by, would it be bad if I tried to make it fun? if i went further into the delusion? I was thinking of giving them names, treating them more like imaginary help than an unfamiliar ghost lurking over all my ideas."

174332932,"My mom took away my adderall and then that’s when I heard the voice that they would take me away in 11 years. I feel like if she didn’t do this so meanly I might have not heard the voice. This has ruined my life. She acts nice to me but I can’t help but feel that she’s the reason they’re going to take me away. This is so horrible. I feel like I’m going to hell because of her. I also feel like I don’t have schizophrenia because I acted out for attention in my younger years knowing this would bring me to counseling services and when they were talking to me I answered questions so I would look bipolar, even though I still had those symptoms."

My insight as you may call it came recently and when I was stable and well. I think it may have came by thanks to this forum and those members on here. I only recently believe it was not real and that it’s schizophrenia or maybe ptsd. It was always real to me even when it was not logical or explainable. So it’s only been two years or so I think."

Dizziness means different things to different people, do you actually see the room spinning or is it just unsteadiness or feeling faint? Anxiety leads to the release of adrenaline which causes a fight-flight response, leading to rapid heart rate, rapid breathing and sweating. Rapid breathing causes a drop in carbon dioxide in the lungs, then blood, which leads to shifts in blood pH (hydrogen ion concentration) leading to dizziness. Another cause is adrenaline leading to narrowing of blood vessels to brain, hence less blood flow to head. Your symptoms can be due to a multitude of medical conditions. These need to be ruled out before you assign your symptoms to anxiety or “stress.” So, it’s better if you can get this thing examined by your doctor."

175918281,"_PERSON_ – 17 Dec 18 How to Practice Tonglen _USER_ID_ teaches us Tonglen, “sending and taking,” an ancient Buddhist practice to awaken compassion. Tonglen is an ancient Tibetan Buddhist practice that is one part of _NAME_ (“Loving-Kindness”). In my experience, Tonglen is an excellent way to engage with people that you think are trying to harm you in anyway. If you think a person you know is plotting to harm you, but it’s in fact psychosis, then see their suffering take it away with your in-breath. Visualize the in breath as black smoke. Then on the out-breath imagine rejoicing for their improved health. I use this as part of a 3 part grounding routine. It was originally for PTSD but I think it works great for auditory hallucination and especially social threats. Tonglen Body Awareness: I focus on the subtle feelings of my left foot, then right foot, then both feet. Finally I focus on the space between my feet.

I’m not one to encourage people no matter the addiction or personal struggle but if you aren’t harming anyone or not honoring obligations perhaps just accepting this side of yourself can bring you some peace. If you have a trusting non judgemental therapist perhaps you could work through the root cause of your addiction. And to be honest there are plenty of worse things you could be doing.

I was in his kitchen and I opened his browser and porn poped up. I am sure he was watching porn on his TV. He told me to close it yelling at me. I had already closed it but it wasn’t my fault really. Thankfully his kids and wife weren’t home. Not sure how his wife would have reacted. Now I hate going to his house so I never go. I never watched porn or masturbated when I had a gf.

It sounds nice but in reality its very tough to make it in that realm. longterm value trades are a lot simpler than the cliche day-trader. takes money to make money honey. i think your zap is like a psychosomatic issue. at some point it happened then it kept repeating now you just expect it to happen and to stop your mind. I suggest CBT therapy for that. exposure therapy. Like example, you say that anytime you try to work you cant do anything. Ok. Try to pick up a magazine. read the front cover open it If you could do that, you successfully defeated that zapping idea. Then you just try things incrementally harder. very slowly until you are at a place where you can get more technical things done. a cbt therapist could help with that if you dont like to do it on your own volition."

""We are all faced with a series of great opportunities - brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems ."" -- _NAME_ Some (of course, not all) of the hardest program bugs to find would be easily spotted if we simply removed our own assumptions. While the shame can be excruciating , few things open more vistas than being hit in the face with what a know-it-all , narrow-minded , delusional , and terrified fool I am. And the beauty of it is that maintaining an optimal mindset requires eternal vigilance . All of this I've learned from living with my husband who really, really knows where it's at. Especially because it takes a ""non-"" (such as many shrinks, I assume) a LONG time to even begin to comprehend what it means to be schizoid. I've tried for over a year, and my poor schizoid friend is still (patiently) correcting many of my assumptio
ns. I keep wondering when he'll get the sh*ts of it, but he's still plugging away at our correspondence. He must be sh*t bored! I'm starting to think that it might be as hard for a ""non-"" to comprehend schizoid reality as it would be for a schizoid to unambiguously feel love.

174332962,"Actions Abstract Background: Patients with schizophrenia display a very high rate of smoking in comparison with the general population. The aim of the present _NAME_-analysis was to assess the association between cognitive performances and smoking status in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: This review was registered at PROSPERO, number CRD_PHONE_NO_. After a systematic search on MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and clinicaltrials.gov databases, all studies measuring neurocognitive performances in both smoking and nonsmoking patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were included. Original data were extracted. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated with the means and standard deviations extracted using a random-effect model. Cognitive performances were compared between smoking and nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia. _NAME_-regressions were performed to explore the influence of sociodemographic and clinical variables on SMD. Results: Eighteen studies were included in this _NAME_-analysis. Ch
ronic smoking in patients with schizophrenia, compared to nonsmoking, was associated with a significant more important impairment in attention (p = 0.02), working memory (p < 0.001), learning (p < 0.001), executive function (EF) reasoning/problem solving (p < 0.001) and speed of processing (p < 0.001), but not in delayed memory, EF abstraction/shifting, EF inhibition and language. The _NAME_-regression analysis found that attention impairment could be influenced by age (p < 0.001) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (p = 0.006). Conclusions: This _NAME_-analysis provides strong evidence that, in patients with schizophrenia, chronic smoking is related to cognitive impairment. This association emphasizes the importance of paying careful attention to both tobacco addiction and cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia.

175918371,"I lost about 20 kg on this medication in 1.5 years just by cutting carbs 5 days of the week, and sugar all together. I eat vegetables instead. It is not very fast, but I found the way I went about it to be sustainable for me which is also important. It took some time to think of recipes that I find satisfying enough to regularly eat. After a while you will start to appreciate the taste of vegetables much more. I gave myself a break every weekend and while not indulging in sweets or crisps, I would treat myself with roast potatoes or pasta’s in the weekend. I also didn’t cut alcohol in the weekends. Clearly, if you would stick to the routine throughout the entire week, things would go faster. I also recommend counting calories. In the end it is a simple subtraction of what you burn off from what you take in. Knowing your way around the amounts of calories of the foods you regularly take, relative to the portion sizes, is also helpful. I found this to be a good way to stay on track. For me it is 
doable to have a negative balance of about 500-700 calories a day, which amounts to almost losing 100gr of weight. Roughly knowing this balance throughout each day is reinforcing for me."

A lot of times we are at the mercy to the resources we have, ie, a man in prison may only have pictures of his children: these are the resources he has to make the best of a bad situation. I remember dating a woman and every time she got angry she would clean her house. I would wake up two in the morning to the sound of a vacuum running; she eventually told me how she had to do something to get out of her mind by getting into her body. This was her way of dealing with being angry with me without taking it out on me. You could try getting out of your head. In addition, you could replace your thoughts with other thoughts based on your resources, but when you’re done making the best of a bad situation the situation keeps changing because time is involved.

Even more surprising, the new guy gave me a couple semi-compliments. It was just mopping the gym but he commented about my style and said I made it look easy. To be honest, it was just the third of fourth time I’ve worked with him and his style sucks. I hate to say it but as I watch him mop it’s like he’s never used a mop before, he’s so slow and awkward that not only does he drive me crazy but it makes me mad. I just want to walk up to him and make him mop better and faster. At first I overlooked it, After all, they hired him to work forty hours a week and they’re trying to teach him and I fiured if they are investing so much time in him than he must be some great worker. I rationalized that maybe his style isn’t that bad and that maybe mine wasn’t that great. But when he complimented me I realized my instincts were right: I
m doing it right and his stye is weird. And a day later we’re in the other gym taking turns mopping and he commented that I worked fast and did a good job. All these compliments!"

175918445,"Thank you everyone. I mean yeah, if nobody commented to online forums about mental illness, and if online forums about mental illness didn't exist because of it, lots of people, including me, would miss out. Many people, including me, find it helpful to comment to forums like HealingWell.com. I like to try to help people going through a difficult time. Also, many find it therapeutic to read threads and responses created by others, such as myself. Therefore, I believe that more good than bad comes from forums about mental illness."

On YouTube there are videos of art by people who have no training, like me. That art is called “outsider art”. I like it because even if it isn’t great it captures something special.

I am sure if I went to a different doctor, they would choose something else. I previously had a pdoc who had me take a LOT of meds which is why I switched to my current doctor in the first place. I’m not sure if her choice is best of not , but I take it because she tells me to. I trust her. I was insecure about my old pdoc, though."

He says he will build a prototype and i can try it. I dont like this. Working together with a new boyfriend is ofc a desastruous idea.

Coffee is made of many chemical compounds and caffeine is just one of them. I suspect it is not the caffeine because when I drink pure caffeine in the form of a pre-workout supplement with a bunch of amino acids and other stuff in it with lots of water for dehydration I have no anxiety symptoms what so ever. I now also know that with psychosis, when anxious or stressed and in particular feeling threatened, the mind loses context for internal and external stimuli such as within the mind or environment. i.e. motivational salience is wrongly assigned to neutral stimuli. This is probably the cause of ideas of reference. That feeling when threatened that irrelevant conversations are about you or thoughts going on tangents when anxious.

175918553,"I have been dealing with severe dizziness for about a year now off and on. I think it’s the drug I’m on that’s doing it…now. the dizziness is very severe and feels like I’m on a very rocky boat. I feel faint, I felt like I almost wasn’t gonna make it home from my walk today. These episodes last months at a time. The psych upped my dose at the beginning of January and I didn’t start taking it till my last 1 month episode of dizzy subsided. I was ok for a week and the dizziness came back so I started just taking the lower dose he prescribed, as he said to do if I had any problems. I have also been having problems with low blood pressure so I thought this was the issue. So the pdoc told me to eat more salt. I did and that seems to have help my blood pressure for the most part. Since my blood pressure improved and the dizziness went away again I tried for the second time to take the increased dose on Saturday evening and immediately got dizzy, went to sleep a d woke up a d felt mostly fin

175918554,"This is such an important thing to always remember: no matter how frightening hallucinations are, they can’t hurt you. By remembering that, it strips away some of their power and puts you back in control (which is another important thing to remember–you are in control of you, no matter what they say!)."
175918555,I’m not interested in sex now (except to make easy jokes about it) but when I was younger I thought about it all the time. I’ve had very little sex but it certainly wasn’t for lack of trying. I got lucky in my drug years a few times. I don’t know if it’s cheating to get sex while you are a practicing crack and coke addict. But I always associated sex with drugs. But I also had a lot of liquid courage. And also with crack and coke. It’s no coincidence that once I got clean and sober the opportunities were few and far between. But in my late twenties in my addiction the goal of having sex was always lurking just under the surface and I got more experiences than I let on. But probably most people on here had more experience.

Well I guess the “creator” isn’t capable of creating after all then? Doesn’t sound too faithful. People are thoughtful who don’t have children. The world is poison for them. And time too.

It’s like being on medication replaces the faulty/symptomatic mental activity I would be having, with no mental activity at all from those parts of the brain. So in a way you could say that my mind has been minimized down to just basic functions. It’s weird how I can’t seem to think hard about anything at all anymore.

174333025,Don’t make excuses not to go! This is very important! My aunt has schizophrenia and doesn’t attend those programs or try to get help except only when she had to do one for disability. They pulled her husband aside after to tell him that she has the identity of a 6-8 year old and when given a multiple exam test she couldn’t even circle the correct presidents name and that was obama’s 6th year in office. She refuses to try anything that requires learning in any way. It’s very frustrating. She gets us all toys or some kind of cat statue as presents for bdays and Xmas and she just giggles like it’s the best thing in the world. We’re all over the age of 40! It’s not that we aren’t grateful it’s just that we don’t know how to help her without hurting her feelings. When we take her out to run errands she’ll ask to go to the dollar store so she can get some kind of animal sculpture and just giggle and stare at it and talk for a long time about where she’s going to put it. Her house 
is filled with them. She wouldn’t even be able to join this forum because she wouldn’t understand any of it. It’s sad.
