Our COMMAND CBT trial approximately halved the rate of harmful compliance (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.88, p = 0.021). The focus of the therapy was a single mechanism, the power dimension of voice appraisal, was also significantly reduced. We hypothesised that voice power differential (between voice and voice hearer) was the mediator of the treatment effect.The trial sample (n = 197) was used. A logistic regression model predicting 18-month compliance was used to identify predictors, and an exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) of baseline variables used as potential predictors (confounders) in their own right. Stata's paramed command used t
o obtain estimates of the direct, indirect and total effects of treatment.Voice omnipotence was the best predictor although the PCA identified a highly predictive cognitive-affective dimension comprising: voices' power, childhood trauma, depression and self-harm. In the mediation analysis, the indirect effect of treatment was fully explained by its effect on the hypothesised mediator: voice power differential.Voice power and treatment allocation were the best predictors of harmful compliance up to 18 months; post-treatment, voice power differential measured at nine months was the mediator of the effect of treatment on compliance at 18 months."

Then after some days this dizzy feeling not there may be my body get used to it quickly. It makes me hard to fall asleep at night and even if fall into sleep its fragmented as I tend to wake several times during sleep. Another major thing I read on internet is valerian root might cause liver damage as it increases stress on liver and kidneys to excrete it. I also found some pain in low back and abdomen regions so stopped taking it as side effects more than benefits. If have severe anxiety then it might help to calm down as bit like sedating feeling at first but problem is need to increase dose to get same effect which is not a good thing as it increases the stress load on liver and kidney.
174389183,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Electroretinogram May Differentiate Schizophrenia From Bipolar Disorder. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, AM _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Biological psychiatry , Jun 27 2019 The retina is recognized as an approachable part of the brain owing to their common embryonic origin. The electroretinogram (ERG) has proved to be a valuable tool to investigate psychiatric disorders. We therefore investigated its accuracy as a tool to differentiate schizophrenia (SZ) from bipolar disorder (BP) even after balancing patients for their main antipsychotic medication.ERG cone and rod luminance response functions were recorded in 150 patients with SZ and 151 patients with BP and compared with 200 control subjects. We created a subgroup of subjects-45 with SZ and 45 with BP-balanced for their main antipsychotic medication.A reduced cone a-wave amplitude and a prolonged b-wave latency were observed in both disorders, whereas a reduced cone b-wave amplitude was present in SZ only. Redu
ced mixed rod-cone a- and b-wave amplitudes were observed in both disorders. Patients with SZ were distinguishable from control subjects with 0.91 accuracy, 77% sensitivity, and 91% specificity with similar numbers for patients with BP (0.89, 76%, and 88%, respectively). Patients with SZ and patients with BP could be differentiated with an accuracy of 0.86 (whole sample) and 0.83 (subsamples of 45 patients with 80% sensitivity and 82% specificity). Antipsychotic dosages were not correlated with ERG parameters.The ERG waveform parameters used in this study provided a very accurate distinction between the two disorders when using a logistic regression model. This supports the ERG as a tool that could aid the clinician in the differential diagnosis of SZ and BP in stabilized medicated patients."

174389184,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Physical performance is more strongly associated with cognition in schizophrenia than psychiatric symptoms. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists , Jul 23 2019 Although neurocognitive dysfunction and physical performance are known to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia, evidence regarding the relationship between these two domains remains insufficient. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between various physical performance domains and cognitive domains in individuals with schizophrenia, while considering other disorder-related clinical symptoms.Sixty patients with schizophrenia participated in the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness and functional mobility were evaluated using the step test and supine-to-standing (STS) test, respectively. Executive function and working memory were assessed using the Stroop task and Sternberg working memor
y (SWM) task, respectively. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Multivariate analyses were performed to adjust for relevant covariates and identify predictive factors associated with neurocognition.Multiple regression analysis revealed that the step test index was most strongly associated with reaction time in the Stroop task (??=?0.434, p?=?0.001) and SWM task (??=?0.331, p?=?0.026), while STS test time was most strongly associated with accuracy on the Stoop task (?=-0.418, p?=?0.001) and SWM task (?=-0.383, p?=?0.007). Total cholesterol levels were positively associated with Stroop task accuracy (?=-0.307, p?=?0.018) after controlling for other clinical correlates. However, clinical symptoms were not associated with any variables in Stroop or SWM task.The present findings demonstrate the relationship between physical performance and neurocognition in patients with schizophrenia. Considering that these factor
s are modifiable, exercise intervention may help to improve cognitive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, thereby leading to improvements in function and prognosis."

174389194,Sorry you started hearing voices. I knew I had sz along time ago especially with delusions I would have but these days I feel my voices are real and they make me so stressed out. They tell me things that I don’t want to hear. They are always planning to do me in like everyday. Today they were planning to inject something in me or do something with my car. I wish they would leave me alone. They keep commenting on my thoughts.
176183282,They said that any sedative can do that and to not get up and move around lol I’m going to need chains for my bed.
174389199,That’s very interesting. Wish they could develop the right drugs then.

176183287,"I’ve had 2 bad relationships in the last few years. The first one did everything she could to shred my reputation when we broke up. The second one, also trashing my reputation while we were still together (our relationship isn’t perfect but I have no idea why she talks about me to people like the way she does). Then I had my episode, making it worse. And just a month ago my ex/current gf did something inappropriate, and I had to cut off my last friend. I’m completely alienated now, isolated, I have no one to text aside from this girl who has been saying bad things about me behind my back for years. I need to reach out, maybe publicly, and say something along the lines of “I’m not okay” or “I need help”. None of my former friends have ever reached out after my illness and events with these two girlfriends. I have a hard time connecting with people, but I used to be very social. The isolation is becoming unbearable and I’m dependent on a person who consistently uses my illness as a 
scapegoat for her actions. I really need to reach out, maybe on Twitter, I just don’t know what to say without sounding unhinged, if I should say anything at all."

174389200,"My other question is, do all therapists deal with these problems? I think my therapist diverts me when I raise these concerns because he is not a specialist in this field. He is brilliant at the Schizoaffective side, and made me rationalise my delusions. Such as, he was very vocal in explaining me the esoteric experiences I had, such as, mind control, etc. Long story short, maybe he doesn’t want to lose a client."

174389207,"Hello everyone, It’s been a while since I came here. I have no good news. I am really frustrated. I am in a breakdown since the beginning of the year. Yes I can’t work at my job and I am on invalidity insurance since the beginning of the year because of a breakdown. And the reason why the recovery is so long is my psychiatrist doesn’t want to collaborate anymore regarding the medication. The only thing that have helped me since I am sick are antipsychotics that are sedative like Zyprexa and Saphris. My psychiatrist doesn’t like to give me such antipsychotics anymore because she thinks they cause a cognitive impairment. So I am stuck with 5 mg of Zyprexa since March 2019 and it’s not enough. Last year I was on 20 mg. So now the problem had became chronic because the dosage is too low. I understand that cognitive impairment is a problem. But it is better to be able to work with a cognitive impairment than being unable to work without cognitive impairment. Do you agree? I asked many time to 
my psychiatrist since March 2019 to raise the Zyprexa dosage and she always refused and now when I ask again she become angry and irritated. And unfortunately I can’t go see another psychiatrist because I live in Canada and the health system is public. So now because of my psychiatrist I am endangered of loosing my job and everything else if the situation continue some months more."

176183308,"Of course an addict who wants to quit uses all the will power he can. But based on my experience, willpower will only carry you part of the way. I used twelve step programs and prayer support people for additional power. Also, I spoke to my treatment team about what I was doing. Believing that schizophrenics do well with the elderly, I courted a few healthy minded elderly persons. When I met a person in recovery I thought could help me, I got their phone number and made it a point to call them soon. Therefore, the telephone was a tool of recovery for me. The main thing about my recovery was I stayed away from the first use. I used honesty. I admitted that I was not like other people. That is, while most people get a mild pleasant sensation from marihuana, I go to hell. It just sends me around a bend. Do you know what antabuse is? If a person takes antabuse, even the tiniest bit of alcohol will make them violently sick. It lasts in the system about four days, and it was prescribed to be taken like e
very day, as I understood it. They gave it to alcoholics who were desperate to stop drinking. But a lot of alcoholics who took it with good intentions were later so desperate to get drunk and get drunk quickly, that they would drink, knowing that they would be good and sick, but believing that after they were so sick, then they could drink to get the desired feeling. There is magic in addiction. It is a thousand laughs and a million tears. If you want to use and you are where it is illegal, you make risk dire consequences because you just have to use. That’s my thoughts on moving to a place with severe consequences for marihuana possession. When I rolled joints, I used to have them fall apart when I was smoking them sometimes. Unhappily, I have put holes in favorite pieces of clothing that way. Good wishes."

174389217,I have had a few relapses. First I was psychotic then I was ok then a couple years later I started hearing voices etc that lasted a few years or more then the voices stopped. A few years later I got delusions. Then I met my x boyfriend in sa and my delusions went away. I hope to not relapse again. I have been hospitalised three times but when I was my worst I was not hospitalised because I lied to them and told them I had no positive symptoms because I was afraid.

Before that I used Fruity Loops 3 and before that some really old midi sequencers. But it was good I was into it already in 1996, as I’ve grown up with all the new technologies.

174389222,"Gaining personal insight into ones illness is such a great feeling. If you make self care a priority even if others think your being selfish, you’re not.

176183343,I get the monthly injection of 156mg. I also have a lot of sleep problems but I think it’s because of the illness. I’ve been on the injection for about a year and half and it’s done wonders for me. I was also exercising a lot a couple of months ago and I kept waking up over and over again throughout the night. Since I stopped exercising it’s made a little bit of a difference. It’s not aggravating my symptoms as much. I take Clonazepam and Benadryl mixed and was getting good results but I think I’ve developed a tolerance to it. I tried about 6 different medications for sleep and none of them worked as well as what has been working so far. I still have problems but they aren’t as bad as they were before. Hopefully this helps and good luck!!!
176183344,Yes online calories calculators with metabolic basal rate (calories burned at rest or metabolism) are useful.
174389218,I felt sorry for myself for a long time when they gave the diagnosis of Schizophrenia. i was having a massive pity party. But it explained all the wierd shite that i experienced - and with that label alone - it enabled me to label it and research for tools for recovery. Im not useless anymore - ive just lowered my expectations. And i fight the anhedonia everyday. Ive come to accept that im gonna be on a depot jab the rest of my life - and that keeps me well. I keep a relaxed attitude to my illness now. Yeah bad days / good days. But im grateful for my stable housing and income - and more importantly my stable mind. Sometimes you just gotta change your outlook on life - and accept it.

Perhaps some things cannot be changed with the usual methods so the system has to be cracked and then repaired. There may be some reality which is higher up, like in the air. Then the spirits need to work below that and establish a grounding. So we at the bottom (sz) have to take time being sick while the ground is being re-established.

174389230,I completely agree with you. They also made my negative symptoms wat they are today! I will be going down in dosage in January next year. I want to be in the right tracks before then as u mention too so I’m changing my diet and exercising to feel healthy for that time. I’m volunteering so I’ve got experience and a good reference starting from next month. Also I’m going to do talk therapy in December so that ought to give me coping mechanisms for stress. I really need that. And work on my self worth too with them.

Sometimes just typing out the message is enough to get the idea out of my head, and then I don’t have to hit send. I have a journal where I can rant and ramble on. I make posts here if I really want feedback. I do highly recommend trying to type instead of talking, because it helps to organize your thoughts and put them in a direction."

174389234,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Schizophrenia, Not a Psychotic Disorder: Bleuler Revisited. AA Loch, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Current diagnostic criteria delineate schizophrenia as a discrete entity essentially defined by positive symptoms. However, the role of positive symptoms in psychiatry is being questioned. There is compelling evidence that psychotic manifestations are expressed in the population in a continuum of varying degrees of severity, ranging from normality to full-blown psychosis. In most cases, these phenomena do not persist, but they constitute risk factors for psychiatric disorders in general. Psychotic symptoms are also present in most non-psychotic psychiatric diagnoses, being a marker of severity. Research revealed that hallucinations and delusions appear to have distinct, independent biological underpinnings-in the general population, in psychotic, and in non-psychotic disorders as well. On the other hand, negative symptoms were seen to be far more restricted to schizophrenia, have oth
er underlying pathophysiology than positive symptoms, predict outcome and treatment response in schizophrenia, and start before the first psychotic outbreak. The current work discusses the concept of schizophrenia, suggesting that a greater emphasis should be put on cases where psychotic symptoms emerge in a premorbid subtly increasing negative/cognitive symptoms background. In those cases, psychosis would have a different course and outcome while psychosis occurring in the absence of such background deterioration would be more benign-probably having no, or a milder, underlying degenerative process. This reformulation should better drive psychopathological classification, face positive symptoms as epiphenomenon of the schizophrenia process, and dishevel _USER_ID_ from schizophrenia and from delusions and hallucinations."

176183417,"Yesterday out of curiosity I looked up my BMI on a little chart that was posted on the nurses station. I am categorized as obese and am just 20 something lbs away from being morbidly obese. I was trying to research how to get back to a healthy weight once obese. The only information I can find is that the chances of me ever being a healthy weight again are incredibly slim. Apparently current weight loss tips and regimens work for people who are somewhat overweight or at a higher healthy weight than they want. They have proven almost completely ineffective for those that are obese and drastically less effective for the morbidly obese. I could not find a single weight loss plan tailored to the obese outside of surgery. It does not seem like one exists. Meanwhile I continue to gain weight on a weekly basis, about 1 lb a week.

176183478,"Don’t be so sure the world will end. Yes, if you look at one side of the picture, things look bleak. But on the other end of the spectrum are the stories few end up talking about – the good news. Heck, some scientists in Finland basically discovered “manna” from Exodus (a white flakey substance from thin air described as looking similar to hoarfrost that could sustain a population in a desert where no plants could easily grow for 40 years): Google ‘solarfoods’ and look at the media page Oh, and that’s right, the technology works by pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere, can be powered by renewable energy, and makes a product that is nutritious and can be repackaged as Impossible Burger 3.0 or the ilk. The cutting edge of scientific research in multiple disciplines is accelerating faster than any point of human history. So yes, it’s a race between our increasingly amazing ability to create against our legacy of increasing destruction. There’s an inflection point, and if destruction win
s, it’s going to suuuuccckkk. But don’t count the good guys out just yet. And if anything, as things get more and more visibly worse, a lot of people on the fence will change things up. The fight is far from over, the future is anything but decided. Have faith in humanity. We may seem like we’re a lost cause, but we’ve been in worse spots before and managed to get where we are today despite being against incredible odds. Just as one example, there’s an argument to be made that the only reason we haven’t had World War 3 is because of the treat of mutually assured destruction. So on one hand yes, nukes are scary, but on the other, maybe they’ve prevented other terrible conflicts. Along the same thinking, perhaps the existential threat of an end of the world as we know it, as it becomes increasingly hard to ignore, ends up being a unifying force for positive change like we’ve never seen in our history. Rather than being the 4 horseman of the end, it might well be the catalyst that forces our hand 
to achieve the beginning of a new and better age."

176183492,I’ve been in a really good place for a long time now and I’m wondering if I should start lowering my less necessary meds. Last time I was in the emergency room they told me I was on too many pysch meds. I’ve gone on and off ssri’s successfully a couple of times over my life. I just worry because I had constant suicidal thoughts when I went back on them last december
176183493,The voices I’ve had near sleep are mostly incomplete messages. The only complete phrases I’ve gotten were “be careful what you wish for” and “it’s real.” It is scary entertaining the idea that they might get worse and become like actual entities rather than like ghosts of the past. I’d have to do like _NAME_ does.

176183511,CBT is basically replacing negative or distorted thinking with healthier thoughts. It really doesn’t work that well with schizophrenia but it may help a little. For me it’s better than nothing. I think that I’m overwhelming my therapist. I don’t think she’s used to having clients that are afflicted with psychosis. She seemed stunned when I told her about one of my delusions. But she’s not giving up just yet.

Here, novel autoantibodies were isolated from patients with schizophrenia. Autoantibody candidates were searched using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting with rat brain proteins as antigens and two sera pools (25 schizophrenia patients versus 25 controls) as antibodies. Immunoreactive antigens were identified by mass spectrometry. Antibody prevalence were evaluated by western blotting using human recombinant proteins. Furthermore, brain magnetic resonance imaging data (regional brain volumes and diffusion tensor imaging measures) were compared. Two proteins of the mitochondrial respiration pathway were identified as candidate antigens. Three patients with schizophrenia, but no control
s, expressed antibodies targeting one of the candidate antigens, i.e., pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, somatic form, mitochondrial (PDHA1, EC 1.2.4.1), which is related to mitochondrial energy production. Anti-PDHA1 antibody-positive patients (n?=?3) had increased volumes in the left occipital fusiform gyrus compared to both controls (n?=?23, p?=?0.017) and antibody-negative patients (n?=?16, p?=?0.009), as well as in the left cuneus compared to antibody-negative patients (n?=?16, p?=?0.018). This is the first report of an anti-PDHA1 antibody in patients with schizophrenia. Compatible with recent findings of mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia, this antibody may be involved in the pathogenesis of a specific subgroup of schizophrenia."

Really toxic and twisted low vibe stuff. No rational human would attack an unwell person over nothing or hearsay. But Ppl have gotten other Ppl killed over rumours, it’s dangerous. No one is privy to the facts, Ppl just want to drag you down, make you their b itch. Like I mean real dumb ???? stuff that can ruin a person. Feeling so alone.

I wrote a long letter explaining exactly how I got messed up as a kid and other things.) Also note she’s a Christian religious extremist. She MIGHT be recovering or trying to become less of a crappy person now but I don’t live with her anymore so I can’t tell exactly how she’s doing in that area. She used to believe (not sure if she STILL believes) every ailment is caused by demons (including blindness and physical afflictions) But she’s insistent that I still have to get SOME kind of job. But she doesn’t realize I can hardly LIVE even without working… like… and when I do work, even with the shortest hours, from home, easy work, etc. my head… it ju
st… I can’t even describe the things that happen that become so much worse when I’m working. Even NOT working I’m a mess of non-functioning because of all my symptoms. I’m not THAT close with her, it’s only recently she’s been somewhat more… nice and less emotionally abusive. She used to be very manipulative and psychologically abusive… to the point I have C-PTSD and I’m not sure if she’s being nice in order to get something out of it or not either… Anyway. Main point being my abusive mother trying to be somewhat nice again is still insistent I need a job but I don’t think she realizes the extent of how bad my illness is. I want to express to her I really CANT work without… I don’t know… telling her I’m REALLY not okay in the head? You know? I don’t want to seem… different to her or family… trying to avoid the “c***y” word… Not like I can avoid her either because I’m relying on her for some support now since I no longer have a job (she helps with groceries and o

176183579,I agree. How would you score this one?
176183580,"Hello, everyone! I just wanted to update everything that has happened so far. I think this is week 7. So… I am less depressed. I still forget things but I am realizing why. I have many, many, too many things going on in my life. My derealization is somewhat fading away. Today it went away along with my delusions for about 45 minutes until I took a sarcosine tablet (thought it would help me with memory and spatial awareness but I was wrong) and everything is somewhat crapped out. BUT! I am getting closer to being better! Mostly all of the bad voices are just plain gone! The only ones left now are those that have been with me for 6 years and even then they don’t frequent my mind. Some of my vocabulary is coming back. A few memories are too. I think it’s my obsessive disorder and delusional disorder that are making me feel lethargic and forgetful. What I am taking now: Geodon 60mg in am and 60 in pm - helps with multiple symptoms. Huperzine A which is an nmda antagonist and a cholinergic reputab
le inhibitor - helps mostly with delusions and somewhat with depression Amyloban 3399 - helps with hallucinations, delusions and general wellness. This one takes a very long time to kick in but it helps. Well, that’s it for now! I want to replace the Huperzine A with memantine and the DHEA with Zoloft but I don’t see my doctor until next Friday. I don’t even think he would prescribe me memantine in which case I will flat out tell him I am going to take a supplement or two (the other is PQQ which oxidizes the nmda neurons which I have taken before and it helped) that decrease nmda activity. Lamotrigine 25mg in the morning - might be helping with memory problems and scattered thoughts, but at such a low dose it is almost less effective DHEA is also an nmda antagonist and modulates glutamate, slightly decreasing it - helps with energy, delusions and depression Phosphatidylserine does not affect nmda directly, some what effects glutamate, and increases ampa activity as does lamotrigine - helps with memory a
nd delusional disorder"

174389292,Yeah I had a mental health nurse coming to my home to give it to me and I cancelled her and decided to get it at my doctor’s office. About a year ago I called the mental health nurse and asked her if I could get it at the mental health place instead of the doctor’s office and she told me because I stopped by injections with her I was no longer eligible to get it at the mental health place. She said how they were fully booked too. Sucks but what can I do I am stuck.

The profrontal stuff was awful for me. https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Improvement-Sarcosine-N-methylglycine/dp/B07KN9XLRH/ref=pd_bap_m_rp_1/140-5687864-9207312?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07KN9XLRH&pd_rd_r=5e352f2f-5ce2-4e10-ab50-014f6f443e67&pd_rd_w=6r6gP&pd_rd_wg=04NXN&pf_rd_p=b5d6be3e-b2ac-42d5-88b7-3ebe5660f038&pf_rd_r=Q38ZQXNZQQN0BANZ7B2E&psc=1&refRID=Q38ZQXNZQQN0BANZ7B2E
176183594,"Closed because this is generating a lot of flags, and I don’t personally wish to watch videos of animal attacks to determine if they are flag worthy."
176183595,Things like insecurity and so on can make us feel like we are less capable at times. But such feelings are not very good evidence for assessing our abilities.
176183596,"Yeah, I know Haldol for sure slows my thoughts down, but I also know I need to take it to keep the crazy away."
176183597,"It sounds like you are not sexually attracted to men and therefore concidered heterosexual. This year I met a woman who I felt incredibly sexually attracted too. I still feel attracted to her but there’s pretty much no chance we can be together because her family owns the place where I agist and I don’t want to put my agistment at risk and she might have a partner. That’s at the age of 41. I have only been attracted like that to probably just a handful of people my whole life and mainly they were people I never saw again. I thought I was heterosexual till this year. After meeting this woman I think I may be bisexual as I wanted to date her but don’t anymore.too much complications. Now I’m thinking of a x I had many many years ago.he is the best sex I ever had.a bit too kinky for me possibly but we never did all those things so if I didn’t have to go all the way that’s ok.we made love though and our hearts clicked and I cried on him.im wondering if we will ever meet again.if we will ev
er lay in each other’s arms again.perhaps not because we live in different countries and I don’t think I will ever fly again. But I’ve had so many sexual partners (sl ut)(I was when I was a binge drinker waaaay to easy)but none has come close to the intimacy we had.had great kisses with others but still not that heart click and intimacy. If you are not feeling any sexual attraction then you are not . I think it depends on the individual. I believe I feel attracted to individuals regardless of their sex. It’s our chemistry,our attraction,our humour, our personalities and spirits etc Good wishes to you."
176183598,"_AT_MENTION_ I hear what your saying, but they are hardly supportive, and my brothers such a fcking mummys boy - he goes along with whatever comes out of her twisted mind. Ive blocked them on the phone. I dont need the hassle. I will “consider” phoning them in a couple of months time."
176183599,"It would be good for you to think about what isn´t an illusion, to be able to know better what an illusion is?"
176183600,Stay away from sex offenders… lowest lot in jail… It’s probably paranoia that they think you killed a cat… but if you yell at your neighbors like you do here… they might get scared of ya. And that could be a reason why they might make rumors about you?
174389301,"Schizophrenia is probably never going to get enough positive information in the public domain to change peoples perspective. I always remember one of my aunts saying to me “Is that like ADHD?” Peoples knowledge of this disease is shocking. I made a post about this in a separate topic, but since I have been diagnosed with autism, I actually notice how healthcare workers treat me differently because of autism. Not so much slack for the SZ in my experience"
176183601,Mother explained it to me when I was 10. It scared me. We had bred hamsters and they always fought a little before they settled down to it. I can’t say it was anything I wanted to do. I refused to think about it. That gave me headaches later on.
176183602,Thanks _AT_MENTION_! He still is experiencing pain on his lower back but I don’t think that it’s a vaccine side effect. He suffers from lower back pain regularly.
176183603,My boyfriend wants me to see a psychiatrist he picked out and consulted with who he is paying 5000 dollars for. He says we will win in court so my parents don’t get guardianship. The psychiatrist says that he wants to run these tests so that we will win. He says this all without talking to me first since my boyfriend convinced him that I don’t have any problems. I don’t plan to discuss my delusional thoughts so I will seem fine too. So this makes me doubt myself even more.
176183604,"I don’t have friends in real life, except for one person I met while inpatient back in 1993. We live about two and a half hours apart now, so we don’t see each other, but we keep in touch by e-mail. I spent almost the last five years on disability and isolating due to my sza, so I never made friends in the city I moved to in 2012. Since starting my volunteer job, I met three acquaintances that I’ll stay in touch with after I leave when I get a full-time job, but I don’t invest energy in maintaining actual friendships outside of work situations. I am close to my husband, mom, and sister and that is enough for me."
176183605,Every morning I take .25. Sometimes take another .25 at night
174389303,"Nope. Just a bipolar cousin and cousins with low iq/learning disabilities. I’m the first. I dont want kids because they’ll probably get it too… My step fathers brother has it. I have it. Im worried my brother may get it…but he doesn’t like me warning him or saying he is going to get it…i understand. In another life, me and my brother both had schizophrenia. He had it worse in a way. Mine is extremely uncomfortable and bad and life altering. I have no evidence, but i think its more than a coincidence. I think i was given schizophrenia on purpose. Theres no other way to rationalize it except saying I have poor genes on both sides of my family… I dont understand why I have alien connections, what happened in college, etc. Its almost like what happened to _NAME_. She pissed off the Illuminati or something and they gave her schizophrenia in my opinion from monarch. I have no evidence. Just my view and self-story."
176183606,"There are both advantages and disadvantages of being on or off APs. You just have to weigh them out, individually, and accordingly, and decide for yourself."
176183607,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ Means a lot to hear!
176183608,"btw folks I had 5 psychotic episodes from 2000 to 2010, longest episode lasted 3 weeks, so that’s mild compared to others"
176183609,"10mgs is just not really effective on haldol. It was really effective with risperidone, but sadly I relapsed and sitting with haldol. Went from 10mgs to 15mgs for few weeks and if everything alright I might up to 20mgs"
176183610,"Even as a child I wasn’t a great one for interacting with others. I get bored with my own company sometimes , but don’t experience the gut wrenching loneliness that some do. I don’t dispute that in terms of coping I need people. That’s been proven by how I was functioning in Essex , and how I’m doing here in Wiltshire. However stepfamily provides that , along with feeling close to them. I’m not champing at the bit to extend my social horizon . I did try a group supposedly for those with mental health problems at my local library , which is a stone’s throw away. It was very difficult to initiate conversation and when I replied to anything it fell flat like a lead balloon. The person running it even made a sarky comment because I gave a £ to the coffee and tea fund. I felt uncomfortable and couldn’t face going to it again."
176183611,I had to google NAC. It’s a supplement. Have your parents taken you to the doctor about this?
176183612,"you don’t live in my boots, your not me, so how can you tell anything about the true me?"
176183613,So my mom really screwed me over… My social security and my birth records do not match which has caused me nothing but trouble getting jobs and whatnot over the years. In the birth system I have a different middle and last name and vice versa with my social. I just got a letter from the selective services saying they will arrest me if I don’t sign up which is annoying because we signed up for it in my civics class in 2015 when I was 18. Hopefully before I go to work tomorrow at 12 tomorrow I can reach the SS office and have them fix this nonsense.
176183614,I didn’t mean to scare you. Sorry. I’m okay.
176183615,It’s ok I take mine everyday but I’d much rather not have to with the shots it’s easier
176183616,"I think I would like to be a friend. Take all the competition our of relationships and all of the criticism and gossip, also."
176183617,"Yes Zoloft did help me before, but I went manic on it, but that was at a high dose, so maybe a low dose would do the trick?? Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I see my new pdoc’s office tomorrow, not sure if I’ll actually get to talk about meds yet or not but if I do I’ll see about a little Zoloft maybe."
176183618,"I remember being psychotic and lying around on the floor of a padded holding cell while worrying about something like this. On the subject of a hellish afterlife, though, if it were that easy to disprove, so many adults wouldn’t have been scared by religious teachings about it for so long. I personally don’t see any evidence of it, and I do see religious evidence against it that I can’t talk about here; but, I don’t see a ‘scientific’ way to disprove its existence."
174389307,If I remember correctly you’re newly psychotic. That sounds so strange to say. I don’t mean to offend. We all are from time to time here. My first treatment was xanax 3 times a day. It does help with panic but it made me depressed so watch for that. I find the best stuff is a combo that stops the positive symptoms and controls the anxiety. I believe everyone should be allowed to control their treatment (unless they are a danger to themselves) but you also need to trust the doctor. They know the medicines so try to give up a little control to them but do what makes you feel better. How are your positive symptoms?
176183619,"This thread is a few says old. I’m hanging in there, today."
176183620,No I took it for depressed mood. I’m not even sure I need it anymore. But I keep taking it anyway.

176183622,"Anyway I made an appointment to see this nutritionist, to improve my diet for diabetes and obesity. She’s an MD also. Both doctors told me I have to lose weight. My psychiatrist told me to eat less carbs."
174389306,"Mail Online – 9 May 19 Key to treating schizophrenia may be found in BROCCOLI, study shows Scientists at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, found sulforaphane - which is derived from broccoli sprouts - boosted levels of signal-sending brain chemicals."
176183623,"go see your general practitioner, they’ll advise you from there"
176183624,"Good luck, but there is still a chance that it can worsen psychosis/mania."
174389308,"At this point, mine just reads off the standard questionnaire and then signs my script. I haven’t had and positive symptoms since I’ve been assigned to her, and my mood swings are mostly under control."
174389314,"At 20 y.o. it was my 3rd suicide attempt. At 18 y.o. I wanted to die so I drove my parents car to the maximum 200kmh in a snowstorm and then ice made my car flip twice, I broke the window and got out. Police said I am very lucky to not die, I lied to them and told them I was at 120kmh. I consider myself very lucky to be alive now after 4 suicide attempts."
174389294,"My depression was caused by life circumstances. For me, my personal narrative was that I beat depression with talk therapy and exercise and self-improvement. I am brand new to schizophrenia. I will be having a medication discussion with an actual psychiatrist hopefully next week sometime."
176183625,"My finances go up and down. I’ve had some periods where I had extra money and I could relax a little knowing I could pay all my bills without worrying about it and still have money for eating out or going places or buying some luxuries. But I’ve also had long periods where I had thousands of dollars of credit card debt. I always managed to pay them off with a few lucky breaks. I work part-time as a janitor, I’ve been there 7 years. Just last year I payed off a several thousands of dollars of money I owed on a couple of credit cards. Now, starting about 7 or 8 months ago I managed to get ahead. I have a little nest egg of money and my income tax return will give me a little more. I can take that money and do something cool like a concert or a trip or buy myself something special. As for now, I just use the money to go to restaurants or buy clothes or occsionally stuff off of Amazon. I’m 58 and when it comes to money I’ve had a lot of ups and downs. But yeah, I have a roof over my head, ple
nty of food, gas for the car and I can pay my bills off each month without worrying about it."
176183626,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 1515151
176183627,Yes. I’m on day 3 _AT_MENTION_ and I’ve noticed less distracting moments

But I have the symptoms like you, one of then being like I’m in a different world. I know I’m in the world, but it just looked different before this illness. Another is seeing signs. I tie vehicle color, like white cars mean God, black cars satan, and red cars hell, silver means money. it sucks because most times when. I drive I think about these signs, and it feels like the devil creeping around."

176183637,no i never said i was an angel when did say that.
176183638,Zyprexa and seroquel are both the same class of antipsychotic and they both make you sleepy. Maybe one will work better than the other for you though who knows.
176183639,"_AT_MENTION_, for your information, getting old is a lot of depreciation. It is evident to me that I am slowly dying. I do not have the resilience of youth. It’s a very real decline."

176183650,I didn’t understand the instructions.
176183651,"From what I’ve gathered from being on mental health, and ASD , forums is that there is far more attention paid to cognitive issues in the USA compared to the UK. My cognitive testing was , at start of 1st hospitalisation, count down from 100 in groups of 7 and number recall . About 6 months or so later I was given a proverbs test. That’s been it."
176183652,"Magnesium Glycinate is supposed to be easier on the stomach than other forms, but it was really hard on my stomach. Wasn’t a pleasant experience."
174389319,I’m confused! Are you yelling at yourself to stop the paranoia and delusions or yelling at people because you think they can read your mind?
176183653,Why do you feel guilty about it (or crap) ?
176183654,"My paranoid delusions are that everyone hates me, no one likes me, that they’re saying bad things about me, telling lies, and insults. I knew something wasn’t right because everyone I knew was, in my mind, lying to me. I started asking why they were so mad at me all the time and it became clear that it was me. That instead of everyone, even my loved ones, against me, it was just my mind playing tricks on me. On a good day I can brush them off in a few hours. When I’m not doing to well, It’ll take much longer."
176183655,Yeah you don’t need that many klonopin pills
176183656,Love living in the city!
176183657,I only took my maximum prescribed dose
176183658,I’m uber stable but a big thing for me is stress. I live a life that avoids stress like the plague! Sure I don’t work but I live a decent life and I’m very happy. I’d like to be independant and not reliant on the old government but I do what i need to do. For you. What are your major stressors? Can you take more meds on harder days? Do you have days worse than others…things like work can be very stressful for a sz?
176183659,"No offense, but this is one of the worst ideas you’ve ever had. You just complained about hallucinations yesterday. Now isn’t the time to stop meds. Ask to be changed to a different med, or to have a lower dose. Stopping meds will make you even more disorganized and also put your kids through hell. Once the honeymoon period is over things will be awful, and you’ll have less chance of responding to your old dose the next time around."
176183660,I quit cold turkey and it lasted 18 months. I don’t remember feeling that different to be honest The reason I started up again was I was at college and it was stressing me and I was heavily psychotic and needed to start back up again. That was 8 years ago and I have smoked ever since. I do need to sort it out again as it’s not healthy
176183661,Sounds pretty cool. I hope it works out.
176183662,"I was always so relieved not to have ant responsibilities, even though uncomfortable accomadations"
176183663,"I’ve had a dry, scratchy throat now for over a week which has turned into a full-blown raunchy cough…I can’t stop coughing. My wife has a screaming headache, and one of my daughters is complaining she is having shortness of breath. There’s a testing building here in my city for Covid 19. We’re going down there today to get checked out. At least I think this is the right thing to do. Perhaps I’ll call a medical emergency line first to see what we should all do. On a positive note, though. None of us have developed a fever yet."
176183664,Well that’s bcz you’re on meds. What about without meds? Because that’s when you have psychosis. If psychosis is so good for you why are you on meds then?
176183665,Marriages do occur through dating apps.
176183666,"Probably physics or engineering. Maybe electrical engineering or computer engineering. Maybe even computer science for the money.

I think that’s the future, but that’s a long way off."
176183667,"My intrusive thoughts used to be constant, and I fixated on them. Now they crop up when I let my guard down. Usually if my thought pattern hits a road block, they cut through and try to disturb me in both senses of the word. They’re certainly cleverer than I am, but I have learned not to listen to them My old psychologist said not to worry as all people have them. She was an asshat anyway, so I am not sure I believe her ????????"
176183668,"I don’t know what to call what I’m feeling. I feel so hyped up, lots of energy, want to dance and sing and laugh loud. Want to talk all high pitched like I’m acting. Talk to myself and to the spirits in my head (Alien and _NAME_). Talk gibberish. Feel like I want to yell and scream and throw things. Feel major excited and fast. To calm down and restrain myself is difficult. But I do it. Yes I do. And I cope ok but when I’m alone I let go and silent yell. I end up wanting to swear at Alien. Then when I interact with hubby I’m normal again. Then I dance in front of him and act all cheerful and laugh. What on earth is this? Psychosis? Hypomania? Mania? Any of you feel this way too? I’m so glad I started seroquel otherwise I doubt I’d sleep at night when I’m like this. Felt two days like this but Alien messed with my thoughts about over a week ago already. I hope seroquel not making me hyper. I think it’s the lack of amisulpride probably… It has happened before on the low dose I’m 
on. I act normal around hubby but I laugh loud a lot and mood goes up then I go all silent and freeze. It’s a f***ing _USER_ID_!!"

176183687,Sinn Fein are the pollitical wing of the _NAME_. Recently they succeeded in gaining majority of votes in our general election. I voted for them my self. I regretted it after though since I remembered all the trauma the _NAME_ put me through. You’d think I would’ve remembered that.
176183688,I’m sorry if what was going on was totally platonic and people made you feel dumb. People on here have a high level of paranoia about stuff. Maybe they did try to take advantage because of your age? I know adults that have run businesses. Of course all of them have run into people that don’t want to pay. It is unfortunately something that you run into while doing business. Maybe take _AT_MENTION_ advice.

176183699,I’m always on the go every day. Whenever i do something I immediately start something else right after. Sitting around makes my symptoms worse so I try to keep busy
176183700,I sympathize with your situation but nothing matters anymore. I’m ??????? useless
176183701,Grounding techniqes and keeping thoughts simple.
176183702,"I never feel sore, because i take creatine and bcaas to recover, my bcaas has glutamine a very important ingredient for post recovery, i eat protein, carbs, fiber and vegetables. Im supply my muscle for repair the next day. So i can go train again."
176183703,"The doctor told me that there is a Hospital Relations Board that I can address about concerns of how my daughter was misdiagnosed on our first Emergency visit. I told her my focus in this moment is on my daughter’s well-being, and that I’ll deal with this at a later date. I need to stay positive right now."
176183704,What time is it now? Regularly snubbed at work by younger co-workers. Used ito it.
176183705,You know that therapy I’ve been doing that you keep telling me has no value? Well…
174389337,Do you have negative symptoms or did you just push and overcome them? I’m hoping in time my drive and focus will come back.
176183706,"I hate that, when parents are totally different at a certain age, and weren’t like that when they were raising you!"
176183707,"Yeah _AT_MENTION_, that can be annoying. I prefer more personal responses such as, “you’re doing well,” or, “well done,” or, “you’re doing well in a tough situation.” I give this advice out a lot & it seems it’s of value to those who receive it…but when I give it out it costs me energy, empathy and so on so I expect to receive it in return. When I don’t (I don’t, like, ever) I feel annoyed & short-changed. For what it’s worth _AT_MENTION_, you’re doing well. You’re doing well in a tough situation."
176183708,Stayed home. Watched TV and got some fishing stuff ready for tomorrow. Debating on leaving here because we’re still fighting covid – I’ll take my chances.
176183709,I think the thing I’m most onto is that you can develop and improve your skills overtime with practice. People say I’m too this I’m too that. “I’m not good at it”. Like my friend _NAME_ said once “good thing I’m not a rapper I’m not very good at it” I wanted to say u could’ve practiced and been good. But maybe it’s not their passion anyways. But if it is I say u should go for something like that so easy to DO on a basic level to get practice and it’s fun. And then ten years later hey you’re good like wtf. Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176183710,"Got to be careful with the drinking. It can soon overtake you. Do you have a traumatic childhood or something of which you are trying to escape with alcohol? Get on the meditation train, and escape reality or come to reality with it. It works for me."
176183711,"I dont know if this will help or not, but what I do when I start to alienate people or distance myself from them is send out a message saying I love them but Im finding it hard to communicate and I may be distant for a while. I explain Im not mad at anyone and will do my best to answer messages. I do this about once a year. Ive gone years without seeing family and friends due to paranoia, and it wasn’t as graceful as just letting it slip away. I was an ass, even though some of it was justified. Everyone forgave me, but Im more careful about how I handle periods of needing to be alone. If thats the last thing you need try sending out a little S.O.S message. Asking for help is hard, but your sisters especially will probably want you to ask instead of distancing yourself."
176183712,I think it counts. If it messes with your thought process ir peace.
176183713,_PERSON_ sometimes it better to just blame objects rather than ourselves or others.
176183714,"I, myself eat a high protein low carbohydrate diet. No rice, no bread, no noodles etc. The protein, however; I need to regenerate my muscles with as I am exercising on the treadmill for 1-hour daily. The more muscle mass a person has the more calories they burn which leads to weight loss. Muscle mass weighs more than fat tissue."
176183715,"I’m on so very much medication now that nothing jerks my tears anymore. And that’s a fact. It’s like I have zero emotions. And, I prefer it this way."
176183716,And couldn’t have it? How do you deal with that?
176183717,"That’s brilliant. Well done _PERSON_, you deserve it."
176183718,"I was (and am) so solitary, I was hoping to strike a chord with people. I’m still really shy."
176183719,The difference is whether you think the thoughts are coming from you or from someone else. But it’s quite a blurry line with a lot of overlap.
176183720,"I feel you. My negatives are bad. I thought it was my shot, but since coming off it I still just spend my day sitting."

174389324,It gives me anxiety but I just take supplements to counteract it. Anxiety can be dealt with in many ways. Discuss it all with your psychiatrist.
176183723,So the medicine is going to stop the tv and everyone else from talking about me?
176183724,I think you’re paranoid.
176183725,It could be because of the shorter days. I’ve been feeling a bit down myself. Hang in there _AT_MENTION_
176183726,I hope so it’s true that people can be persuaded.
176183727,This a nice way of thinking about the situation

176183729,"Yep, he surprised everybody."
176183730,"It’s weird I thought as well. If anyone talks about vaccines to me now I am not telling anyone I have had it if it will cause a problem like this. The government here I think because they approved them before any other country got ahead of the queue for supplies. Not sure. They’re saying how much of a success it is, but hard to take their word for it. It’s strange how he behaves sometimes. He moved quite far away and blanks people a lot and doesn’t answer his phone a lot of the time. He has been communicating with me a lot recently, and this is the only thing I can think of why he didn’t call today"
176183731,"_AT_MENTION_ , some books are easier than others that’s for sure. My mum does a lot of colouring in, we have removed probably 20 or 30 to laminate and protect them. You could try and use an exacto knife if theres no staples or easy way to get them out. Use with a ruler and then clean up the edges once you have removed. Anyways, it was just a thought."
176183732,I plan on taking a shower tomorrow. Hopefully I’ll manage to pull through. Tomorrow is a new day. One step at a time!

176183735,"I don’t know how to really find a purpose. I try to do everything well, and sadly I’m a perfectionist, always have been. Being a perfectionist is very hard with an illness like this. I guess part of my problem is that trying hard in all aspects of my life isn’t really paying off yet. It just feels like my goals keep getting farther and farther away."

176183738,you don’t know _AT_MENTION_ ? he’s been here a long time.
176183739,Oh _AT_MENTION_ . My paranoia was through the roof with your post and commentary. I thought you had evil designs. My apologies.

176183747,Yeah i can still hold on to my job. In my jobs there’s students who don’t turn up for 6 months and still have their job. Because mostly it’s temp and you only get paid for the hours you do. One student came in after over a year.
176183748,I guess so. But it’s the way you took off 200 miles an hour.
176183749,Hi. We usually like old threads to be redone if it’s been a while. Most punters move on from previous entries and it’s always good to start a new conversation and get more up to date information. Please feel free to ask your questions again and start a new thread. It simply keeps things more manageable and easier for the average user. Thanks…_USER_ID_…I see you did start a new thread. I’ll leave this here but thanks for moving forward.
176183750,I’m not suicidal tbh I’m just really depressed and drained like I know death won’t fix my problems There’s just so many negative things happening rn and I feel overwhelmed. I really need a new therapist tbh it’s just so hard to find one rn so I’m kind of stuck
176183751,Why can’t you go back on your previous prescribed med dosage? It’s easy and would clear up the problem in no time.
176183752,"Hey, we’re neighbors! I think you posted that before though."
174389329,"No, no sponsor. Never had one which is probably unusual / ill advised ! Congratulations to you on the 5 months. That’s amazing if you’ve been drinking since you were 15. _AT_MENTION_ who posted above is the record holder here with 30 years sober I think. But at the end of the day we’re all just taking it 24 hours at a time. I first went to AA in 2003 but had a slip 6 years ago where I got drunk. So that was a sharp reminder that it’s just one day at a time."

Think of how cattle get all alienated because for centuries they have been slaughtered after only a couple years. Look at their eyes and see. They have made it all very impersonal though, people, someone else does it far away and the meat only is in the store and it tastes good! No offense to vegetarians of course."

176183781,"No, I think the normal thing is to move around while you sleep, and not have to fully wake up in order to move. Maybe it’s a medication side-effect for you too?"

176183783,If it wasn’t for one of my meds that makes me vomit when drinking I’d still be drinking to this day.
176183784,To add to my story above. My mom bought a hamster. She thought adding a cute fuzzy animal to the house would brings some calm to the situation. I was so psychotic I started thinking the hamster was in on the conspiracy. I was going to kill the hamster one night. In retrospect I’m just glad no one got hurt. I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I felt like a cornered animal in a survival situation. I thought everyone and everything was out to get me. I’ve stayed on meds all these years because I don’t ever want to end up in that state of mind again. Even though I was having violent thoughts I never acted on any of them. There was still a small part of reasoning left in my head.
176183785,Lower in smaller increments ask your doc to give you 3 mg and .5 mg if your taking 4 mg that’s what I would do only because I had terrible withdrawals on risperidone

176183788,Sorry about the car. I have been knocked down by life so many times beyond count. Still. I get up and I go again. Sure I learn some things but sometimes I wonder if I’m getting wiser or more stupid. I think the jury is still out on that one.

But regardless, I know it’s a symptom now and I’m getting it under control, but there’s a part of me doesn’t want to remove it, because it brings me comfort. Still, I’ll do whatever is in my power to control delusional thinking so I won’t completely break again."
176183796,"I’m sorry. One of my brothers is the same way. I’ve basically stopped having deeper conversations with him and just settle for small talk when I have to talk with him since it’s clear his ability to connect to others on an emotional level is lacking, to say the least."

Today I’m making it without the Tylenol, and am not hurting much. The only problem with Tylenol is that I’m an alcoholic and can’t slip taking Tylenol. It will damage your liver if I do. Not to worry. I go to Alcoholics Anonymous. I’ve been sober 47 days and before that I was sober for six months. It’s kinda hell though not being able to take Tylenol or not being able to drink."

176183806,"_AT_MENTION_ I can relate. But, your life will change. Your relationships with your family will improve. You will reconnect with friends or make new ones. You will become less afraid because there will be less trauma from crisis moments. These are what I hope for."

By now im a bit done with the troubles and would like to be mentally stable. I dont think my current state really benefits anyone, including me."
174389340,I think not taking your Saphris regularly is probably a bad idea. Random use doesn’t let it build up in your system like it should to be used appropriately. I would think maybe it’s just time to try a different med.
176183810,Good choice. I’m drinking one right now over rocks.

176183821,"I’m curious – if discussion of simulation theory is so common these days, why do you feel it is a bad thing? If we are in a simulation and it is being discussed, isn’t it possible that discussing such a thing is a good thing? The New York Times recently had a piece arguing that we shouldn’t try to figure out if we are in a simulation as it might “upset” the simulators. But I felt it was a shortsighted view of the topic, as it already is a common topic of discussion especially as we hit boundary conditions on the universe in physics. Might not a discussion about the nature of a simulation also lead to discussion about a “win” condition for our universe? Better understand the purpose of things? Our minds seem quite able to manifest our fears/desires/insecurities/fantasies. As to your point about Christianity and Jesus being the son of God… What if the point was that all of us were the Son of Man and the Son of God? Maybe Jesus’s message got a bit mixed up in the roughly 40 years b
etween his death and when scholars think Mark got around to writing his version of events (which both _NAME_ and _NAME_ copy passages of verbatim, so they likely came even later, and _NAME_ includes Gnostic aspects that put it more likely around 200-300AD). In particular, one passage that comes to mind is when Jesus is eating from a field on the sabbath and gets criticized. He responds that man wasn’t made for the sabbath, but the sabbath was made for man, so as the Son of Man he is king of the sabbath. The clear later interpretation of that passage was “Jesus was special so only HE was the king of the sabbath,” but was that really Jesus’s point? Aren’t we all sons of man? Doesn’t scripture cite that all of us are children of God made in His image? A lot of people that find themselves to this forum believe or believed themselves to be Jesus come again. But what does that really end up meaning? That they are an incarnation of God as a human being? Well certainly _NAME_ suggests the very thing. And 
if we look across the pond at Eastern religions, they too suggest the very concept. Maybe literally thinking we are Jesus is going a bit overboard on the specificity, but the idea that we have divine natures isn’t that far off the mark. If you are the child of God, does that mean if you let your fears run wild they will become palpably real for you? Maybe that’s exactly what’s happening. Maybe it’s not that you lack faith in God, but that you lack faith in yourself. Try forgiving yourself any past transgressions. Recognize that you deserve happiness. Recognize that everyone deserves happiness (yes, even terrible people – “forgive them for they know not what they do”). Because if you deserve happiness, and if everyone does, and you are yourself a child of a supreme being, then maybe the reality you find yourself in – not the one that we all share (which to be fair isn’t one we can simply decide to be different without working together with others) – but the terrible reality you and only you 
are experiencing, that your step-father doesn’t remember (or anyone remembers)…maybe that aspect of reality is something you can change. Try it. Pick a small aspect of it. Maybe deny “them” their existence. Why would there be any being in between yourself and God? Sure, we could all probably imagine some version of reality where it’s a dystopia and we’re being controlled for some reason…but is that any more likely that a utopia where the way the world is has a greater purpose like teaching us empathy and right and wrong by way of experiencing the effects of it firsthand? Or how to control our consciousness in a world that won’t change no matter how we think it might? From all appearances on this forum you are an intelligent and well read person. And that intelligence can be a double-edged sword when your mind escapes your control. We all know the experience of what happens when our minds create an alternate reality and makes the dots connect in such a way that the resulting picture feels as re
al if not more real than the one everyone else sees. But maybe you can seize back the reins by re-drawing the picture. I found it easier to start with something insignificant to try this out, like a coin. Can you take a coin and stare at it, and force yourself to believe it is somehow connected to a sinister world? Can you then change your mind and believe that it’s the key to preventing that sinister world? Can you go back to thinking that it’s just a coin you picked up? It’s a bit of a silly exercise, but if you can do it with the coin, it should be possible to do with everything else. Also, it became much easier to manage these ideas for myself when I accepted that I was no more or less inherently special than others. I couldn’t let go of the paranoia while still holding on to the idea that I was “chosen” or “destined” for great things, no matter how I tried to alter the parameters with the coin trick. It’s not that bad being on the whole average. In fact, I strongly suspect that the reas
on there’s an inflection point for _PERSON_ at around 75% is that it’s the ideal place to be. When you are in the very top percentile at something, it’s very isolating and lonely so your brain tries to assume more people are as skilled as you are. When you are in the bottom, you want to be better than you are. So maybe don’t strive to be number 1 or number 2. Just aim for roughly number 1,925,000,000 (75th percentile of 7.7 billion). Given that we all tend to regress towards that mean anyways, chances are we’ll be much happier being one of many than “the one.” Including being better able to let go of a version of reality in which we are persecuted for our specialness."

Every time I though I was being monitored by some kind of evil force/energy/AI that was going to torture me for eternity. I didn’t really get voices, it was more like my thought process was hijacked and I couldn’t think about anything else other than being tortured for the rest of my existence, and everything was a dark coincidence/synchronicity that fed back into that delusion. Usually I’d recover in a week or less, but the thought still comes back everyone in a while. Now when I start thinking like that, I just tell myself if I was actually in hell it would be constant torture and there woulnd’t be anything pleasurable, either good or neutral.

174389367,"Symptom overlap between ASD and SZ may be most apparent in the negative symptom domain, broadly reflecting deficits in social communication and social–emotional reciprocity. For example, negative symptoms in SZ include flat or blunted affect ( e.g. , reduced affective sharing, eye contact, facial expressions, and use of gesture), alogia (impoverished speech, perhaps reflecting difficulties with thinking and cognition), avolition/apathy (lack of energy, drive, and interest), anhedonia (lack of social and recreational interest), and inattentiveness (35). Similarly, negative symptoms of ASD largely represent deficits in social–emotional reciprocity and engagement, such as reduced sharing of emotion or lack of social initiation, deficits in nonverbal communication ( e.g. , reduced eye contact, limited use of gesture, limited range of facial expressions), and reduced spontaneous communication and conversation flow (34). These respective descriptions suggest an overlap between ASD and SZ related to t
he absence of typical social and communicative behaviors (9). Central to the RDoC framework, these negative symptoms that overlap in their clinical manifestation may well stem from similar biological mechanisms. In one study, participants with either ASD or SZ showed reduced neural activation in the right _USER_ID_, fusiform face area, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex compared to controls while performing complex social cognitive tasks (36). Thus, it is likely that negative social and communicative symptoms in both ASD and SZ have common neural origins that impact social cognition (37) PubMed Central (PMC) Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia Are Better Differentiated by...

The aim of the study was to investigate the utility of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a harm reduction intervention in this population.Fifty tobacco smokers with a psychotic disorder were enrolled onto a 24-week pilot study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02212041) investigating the efficacy of a 6-week free e-cigarette intervention to reduce smoking. Cigarette and e-cigarette use was self-reported at weekly visits, and verified using carbon monoxide tests. Psychopathology, e-cigarette acceptability and adverse effects were assessed using standardised scales.There was a significant (?50%) reduction in cigarettes consumed per day betwee
n baseline and week 6 [F(2.596,116.800) = 25.878, p < 0.001], and e-cigarette use was stable during this period [F(2.932,46.504) = 2.023, p = 0.115]. These changes were verified by significant carbon monoxide reductions between these time points [F(3.335,126.633) = 5.063, p = 0.002].The provision of e-cigarettes is a potentially useful harm reduction intervention in smokers with a psychotic disorder."

The reason is everyone understands and respects the bomb for what it is: World wide destruction. There is a lot of negotiating behind the scenes of all of these conflicts.

174389398,"Tried to write this thread like three times now. Essentially, its been 13 years since my breakdown and I’ve never worked. I’ve also (even pre psychosis) never liked the concept of working full time - to obtain the funds to exist - so that I can continue to spend all my time slaving away at things I dont really want to do. When I was 13 I really didn’t see my life progressing beyond 21 because life in fulltime work seemed so pointless and mundane. And today my mindset isn’t very different Fast forward to now, I get some benefits, but even if I got more benefits that I currently do, I won’t get more than about £700 a month to live off. This is not enough to live on. I live in a very expesnive area of the country. But even if I were to move drastically - I’m still not sure my situation would be entirely different. I basically require someone to take pity on me and house me and help me with food. In the current instance its my parents. But at some point, they will die. At which point I wil
l have to face these issues on my own and probably become homeless, and probably lose my sanity as well as any passions in my life - or alternativly end my life - something I’ve thought about a lot in the last 7 years or so. Sometimes I feel like I’m in this sense of limbo. I’m not dead yet, but I don’t really feel like I’m living like most people. I’m living a half life. As well as not having a desire to work, I’m unsure whether I am able to work anything more than a few hours a few days a week. I’ve never had a job, and so its something I would need to work towards (which Im not against). But even if this job was obtained -again it is still not enough to live off. Which leads me into my main dilema that I feel like _PERSON_ just kind of feeding off my family, and my death is somewhat inevitable. If it was as easy as pulling a switch I would have done it already. I’ve only had one real suicide attempt where I was hospitalised, but it something I come back to a lot. I just feel like there re
ally isn’t a future for me so why am I wasting my parent’s money in pretending there is a future for me? I just dont see a reality where I am working full time. Again its been 13 years since I’ve had schizophrenia and my life is very similar in terms of how I spend my time. If it hasn’t changed in 13 years - how is it going to change? I just feel like my end at my own hand is certain. Its more of a question of when and how then anything else. Even if I could do it without any problems - whats even the point of existing if your entire life is taken up ???? you don’t actually care about?"

Some looking around online and turns out to be more common than I would’ve known “The living nightmare” happened to other wise healthy and young adults, delusions as well as dark hallucinations. Listen, its a long shot, has anybody taken a really hot shower when your hallucinations get out of hand? The drug is an antihistamine and deliriant. Could highly be correlation not causation but getting histamines riled up from the heat in my theory would pull a reverse and calm the ???? down. In theory intense heat would soothe it, figured worth a shot"

I am getting 5-6 hours a night without it as PRN With the Procyclidine, because I am not using the Levomepromazine, I no longer seem to have movement issues and I am not taking much at all - just the occasional 5mg as a token if I feel weirded out and that I might be withdrawing. Sertraline should be out of my system now, and I refused to replace it with Mitrapazine even though my pdoc said this would be ‘wise’ to take a hundred times… Amisulpride I rate highly as I have had my positive symptoms very well controlled, and literally the only drug left to try is Clozapine, so for the win!

176184064,"Insulin is the hormone your body releases to absorb glucose, which is the main nutrient you get from food that fuels your body and brain. If you eat a lot of junk, your body is flooded with glucose and your body is forced to produce more and more insulin to be able to manage it all. When your body is flooded with insulin your body begins to not pay attention to it as much, and soon you need more and more insulin to get the job done the same way if you drink caffeine or alcohol regularly you start needing more and more to get the same effect. Certain medications can also cause your body to not pay attention to insulin as much. If this insulin resistance is left untreated unfortunately it can lead to the development of type II diabetes so it serious to take care of it before it reaches that point. Intermittent fasting has been clinically proven to decrease insulin resistance. And if one can get to a healthy weight often insulin resistance goes away entirely."

174389411,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Implicit and explicit processing of bodily emotions in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, EL Bass, CR _PERSON_ and AE _PERSON_, Cognitive neuropsychiatry , Dec 23 2019 Disturbed emotion processing is well documented in schizophrenia, but the majority of studies evaluate processing of emotion only from facial expressions. Social cues are also communicated via body posture, and they are similarly relevant for successful social interactions. The aim of the current study was to thoroughly examine body perception abilities in individuals with schizophrenia.Fifty-nine patients with schizophrenia and 37 healthy controls completed two tasks of body processing. The first, which was based on the Affect Misattribution Procedure, evaluated implicit processing of bodily emotions, and the second utilised a traditional emotion identification paradigm to assess explicit emotion recognition.Results revealed aberrant implicit processing, but more normative explicit processing, in individuals with sc
hizophrenia. Moderate associations were found between processing of bodies and symptoms of paranoia. Performance on the tasks was not related to cognitive functioning but was associated with clinician-rated social functioning.Collectively, these results provide information about disturbed processing of bodily emotions in schizophrenia and suggest that these disturbances are associated with the severity of positive symptoms and predict difficulties in everyday social activities and interpersonal relationships."

At the same time I will be upped with100 mg seroquel and 40 mg geodon.

176184120,"Does anyone else deal with hearing their own voice in their head? What about a voice that’s constantly putting your own self down! I’m talking about saying horrible disrespectful disgusting mean things about yourself! Because that is me everyday! Ppl wonder why I have good clap backs or isn’t bothered when ppl name call me, that’s because no one could ever top the evil things I say to myself about myself in my head. This is something that is constant very loud and so overbearing that I have to turn my music volume up, cusp my hands over my ears or just shout shut up out of nowhere! These self dragging session could be triggered by anything I deem stupid embarrassing or not done right by me and that’s pretty much any and everything.

I’ve carried this evil voice in my head since I was young and it’s kept me feeling worthless, doing worthless crap and getting treated like I was worthless for a long time. When good ppl came around the voice told me they were just tricked and in time they would see the worthlessness in me and I believe it so I spend my entire life learning how to please ppl even if that meant being a doormat. Out of fear of these verbal attacks I was able to pick up on ppl emotions and was able to quickly read them by first impressions and would try to be exactly what they wanted so they wouldn’t see I was “worthless”. I didn’t care if I got treated like a POS…anything not to hear that voice. The stupid voice bothered me so much I couldn’t take it at one point and tried to kill it and myself in the process even though I had kids and a husband. That voice al
ready had me thinking they were better off without me sooo… It took a looonnnnggggggg while but I’m a lot better and a lot stronger!

So the 0.5mg risperidone which i was taking could be increased by paroxetine in my blood to like 1.5-2mg. Hence the prolactin is high on 0.5mg too. To be more technical paroxetine Inhibits CYP450 2D6 and risperidone is metabolized by CYP450 2D6. Hence if take both of them together, your risperidone is going to increase in your blood cuz of paroxetine."

174389453,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Mindfulness-Based Social Cognition Training (SocialMind) for People With Psychosis: A Feasibility Trial. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Introduction: Difficulties in social functioning are common among people with psychosis. Negative symptoms such as blunted affect or social withdrawal are often linked to these difficulties and worsen real-life outcomes. One important dimension associated with social functioning is social cognition, which refers to the psychological processes that are necessary to perceive, encode, store, retrieve, and regulate social information. Mindfulness-based interventions for people with psychosis are safe and effective in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms; however, no mindfulness-based interventions addressing social cognition have yet been developed. Method: A pilot, single-arm, nonrandomized, noncontrolled feasibility trial is proposed. The main objectives are to assess t
he tolerability of mindfulness-based social cognition training (SocialMind) and to test the feasibility of a further randomized controlled trial. Results: A final sample of 25 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was included. Attrition rate was lower than usual for this population, and most participants completed the training. No adverse effects were identified in terms of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, dissociative and psychotic symptoms, or state of anxiety during the sessions. Conclusion: This is the first implementation of SocialMind, which is the first mindfulness-based social cognition training. It is well tolerated by participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and a further randomized controlled trial is proposed for people who have suffered their first episode of psychosis within the past 5 years.

ething came up that we couldn’t take the kids to the bat event, he came over with 300 cash and told us to have fun. He’s having a lot of health problems, he has a quarter of a heart that works, a colostomy bag, etc. But for 55, he still runs around pretty good. I should message him and see how he’s doing, last time we talked was June and my brother was 21 and decided that partying was a great idea.

I don’t feel any resurgent psychosis or other mental illness. Because of the L- theanine I don’t miss the Geodon. (I do plan to get back on my regular dose of Geodon as soon as it is available. I’ll probably sleep a lot more.) Another, stranger effect of L - theanine is that it feels like it is loosening up my connective tissue.

Another is cognitive remediation such as BrainHQ (this particular one was studied with positive results) which helps to improve even schizophrenic brains.

Also not all nsfw topics are that open about it there’s been a few topics that seem innocuous but you open them and it’s sex also I’ve seen people talk about it in the say anything threads… Which is… Less than ideal."

174389477,"It’s no big deal, it was just one episode out. I agree with your point now that I’ve seen it. I kind of feel like the story featured a schizophrenic character but wasn’t really about schizophrenia. It does make me feel really good about my recovery because I don’t act like _NAME_, but I really felt for him when he was struggling in college, I dealt with that in my prodromal phase."
176184287,Oh wow I apologize.
176184288,"ok, I must have missed something then."
174389479,"I also recently bought a book on schizophrenia and was reading about the predictors of a poor outcome and saw that I had several (relatives with schizophrenia, born in winter, gradual presentation of symptoms) so that got me pretty down about my hopes of recovery. But as I said, I will just ignore that and try to do the best I can every day."

176184305,Has any one had their voices show them wonders or delusions like being in a _NAME_ in wonder land or a kind of fairy tail. The voices were being nice to me when this all started and I was talking to magic people and cool aliens and getting all these feelings I was in a fairy tale and I was experiencing magic and spirits and didn’t want it to stop then I started to smoke cigarettes and the voices turned evil and stopped the fairy tale then said I didn’t deserve it any more and it was all a test. Did any one else have their voices have their voices put them on an adventure that stopped abruptly or is still going on?

176184307,_AT_MENTION_ . A psychiatrist told me once that if you are prone to any mental illness that trauma can trigger it. The first time I ever had a hallucination was I think right after my mom died. Her death was really hard on me. I was physically sick from nerves at her funeral. I had diarrhea right before the service but luckily it cleared up in time so that I could sit thru the service
176184308,I knew a 76 year old barber who gave my daughter the most adorable pixie cut when she was just a little girl who swore by the stuff. I didn’t know he was drinking his own urine prior to the haircut lol. He was in great shape and was sharp as a tack. But maybe it was the low stress job choice.
176184309,"That shows a lot of maturity. You made the effort even knowing it wasn’t likely, and you don’t hold it against her that she wasn’t interested. That is really impressive, especially for your first time asking someone out. Dating is hard, especially at your age. Nobody really knows what they like for themselves yet, and too many kids just try to follow what/who they think they are supposed to like. It really does get easier as you get older."

176184312,I’d say from age 8-18 Tw mentions of abuse It was a rough childhood. I had so many suicide attempts. The abuse and my mental health just made a hell of a time. My parents were pretty abusive cause they didn’t know how to deal with a child like me with so many mental health issues. We’d argue about meds mainly (though there was plenty of other things we argued about) and I’d get my ass beat for it. I first attempted suicide at age 8. And I became “We” at some point around there. My hallucinations became scary but no one helped me. Then at 10 my psychiatrist started sexually abusing me and that kept going til I was 16. She gaslit me and used my mental health against me. She manipulated me over and over and over again. Luckily I got away from her But It was impossible to be happy in a situation like that. I’m just happy I survived But luckily I’m better now. I’m happier now. Things have gotten better

176184317,So I am using champix to quit smoking… I am on my 12th day of using champix and so far it’s going good. I don’t feel like smoking at all since 3 days. But the urge to smoke hasn’t gone yet. I keep going to the cafe near my house to smoke cigarettes. Since the last couple of days I have been lighting up a cigerrette and keep throwing it off mid way. So when will this urge come down and become zero? I hate smoking as of now but the urge to light a cigerrette hasn’t died yet. Please advise on this.
176184318,"So I had a shower today for the first time in twenty five days, ughhh, I can’t believe I used to shower everyday at my parents’ house and at university despite being ill.

176184328,I had a gf who said she loved me when I tried to break up because I felt our relationship was solely based on sex. And later she dumped me when she found a better sex partner. I think many couples confuse sex and love. Especially young people.

176184330,50 mg. I have definitely considered asking to go down to 25 mg I am just anxious about it maybe not working as well for my bladder. But it is definitely worth trying i think if it would stop these awful sleep attack things. It’s like my narcolepsy attacks but on steroids.

176184335,"Some things are just fun. When I used to go gambling in Reno, it wasn’t just playing the games, it was the whole experience i.e. Staying in a hotel, ordering room service, the actual gambling, the shows, the free drinks and ogling the beautiful waitresses, the free shows in the lounge, the excitement of being in a casino and yes, the buffets. I’m not putting down your choice of what you want to do with your own money, but just saying that there’s a reason why gambling is so big and why so many people go to Las Vegas or casinos in other places. And man, it’s nice occasionally when you win and come home with an extra $100 in your pocket."

176184338,"Mental toughness In the midst of winter, there resides in you an invincible summer. . _NAME_ says that “We live in a time where the self is viewed as fragile.” Mental toughness is the opposite of that. In the field of sports psychology, top athletes’ ability to thrive on stress, dissolve pressure, deal swiftly and decisively with tough situations, manage distractions, be unafraid of conflict and confrontation, perform in the upper ranges of their potential more consistently, excel in the clutch of pressure, and drive relentlessly in pursuit of a goal, regardless of how long it takes or how much pain is involved has been an area of great interest. This type of resilience in sports has been termed “mental toughness.” Mental toughness is an attitude that an athlete takes with them into every situation. It is the result of adversity training and emotional strength training. It is the mind’s ability to deal effectively with adversity- to rise through adversity. In the midst of winter, there 
resides in you an invincible summer. It is being driven by purpose, committed, dedicated, courageous and filled with heart. It means consistently making the right small choices from moment to moment when confronted with options to veer off track. It means welcoming resistance because it will make you stronger. Mental toughness grows by refusing to just take the path of least resistance and welcoming challenges. According to sports psychologist _NAME_, mental weakness, in contrast to mental toughness, comes from the biological propensity to focus on the negatives and problems. Those who are mentally tough focus in the face of negatives or problems on solutions and what they could possibly do to make it better. What is one thing you could do to improve this situation. Build mental toughness It means learning to stop any tendency toward stress sensitization or a delicate emotional sensitivity and building distress tolerance. You have to toughen up around all of the wounds from traumatic events and become open an
d loose. Being mentally tough also includes taking pride in overcoming difficulties; the greater the difficulty, the greater the pride. Controlling your thoughts is half the battle. Become aware of the way you talk to yourself. You have to give yourself the right messages during times of stress. What do you say to yourself when the road gets rough? You can upgrade the inner dialogue you have with yourself. We all talk to ourselves internally, sometimes resourcefully, sometimes negatively, irrationally or critically, sometimes with our own voice, sometimes with the voice of others. You can learn how to respond effectively with the right words and pictures formed in your mind to the voice in your head that gives you negative or distorted messages. If the voices you hear try to disempower you, you can infantilize them by pointing out their childishness and restore your power. With practice you can learn to disrupt and tame negative thinking cycles. If you have sabotaging thoughts, you can learn how to answer the
m back with conviction. If you have catastrophic thoughts or irrational deep beliefs, you can challenge and refute them. If you get caught in counter-productive thinking traps where you jump to conclusions with insufficient evidence, you can learn to recognize them, put bad events in perspective, think rationally, and take the focus away from counter-productive thinking and shut it down. You can think of your mind like a glass of water. There may be dirty water in the glass colored by negative, irrational or critical thoughts. But, if you run a faucet of clean water into the glass continually, the dirty water gets displaced. Run a faucet of resourceful positive thinking into your mind. Talk to yourself better. Learn to talk to yourself with deep confidence. What is the tone of your self-talk? Some people may think that being mean or cruel is mentally tough, but cruelty is unnecessary and morally wrong. One can face the cruelty and meanness of others with firmness. Being responsible is being mentally tough. Th
e greater the responsibility ably shouldered the tougher you are. Finally, mental toughness means maintaining composure, maintaining poise under pressure, keeping your cool when others around you are losing their cool. It means keeping your composure despite repeated provocations. It means remaining calm and centered even under the duress of the most serious storms of life. It is the ability to execute well under pressure. Some say that mental toughness is having backbone or steel in your spine. Be stronger than your trials and woes. It means managing distractions that take your focus away from what’s important. It means answering criticism and responding to doubt. It means resisting others’ negativity and standing firm in the face of those who try to pull you down. You have to believe in yourself to be mentally tough. You build belief by working intensely to make believing in yourself possible. Those who seem to have less talent but who are mentally tough can achieve great success through desire, resolve
, perseverance and attitude. Those with talent and the attitude of mental toughness can become superstars. (_PERSON_, 2005) Toughness is in the soul and the spirit, an indomitable will. The mind and the spirit can toughen in the face of difficulty. You need a strong mental attitude. It comes from pictures and words you form in your mind. Your mind has to be the strongest part of your body. The only reason someone becomes mentally tough is because they clawed their way there. Undergo some suffering willingly to inoculate you against hardship and become tougher Success comes to those who can weather the storm, forged into personality strength going through ???? storm after ???? storm, but also by the powers of true affection, to the victorious holding the line in the full course of psychological warfare. All of the challenges in life are good mental training. As _NAME_ suggests, “Move through hardship and integrate it in a way to become better.” Take _NAME_s advice, be “relentlessly solution focused.” A
dversity is a challenge to learn a new empowering language and have the answer for anything that comes at you. Develop a natural uncanny flair to handle tough situations and pull through adversity with a great spirit. Outmaneuver and out-think whatever adversary you’re looking at. No matter how exotic or great the pressure, learn to be resolute and unflinching. Responsibility is the most important toughness. Live responsibly. Lead responsibly. Build an undefeatable mind, a fortress of strength, an armor that makes you feel invincible. Keep pushing yourself to the next level. Hold yourself steady when the weather turns stormy. Handle the goddamn pressure. Make yourself strong. Become psychologically fit as well as physically fit and enjoy the high of feeling strong. Build mental toughness through adversity training and through mindset, movement, nutrition and recovery. Swing the weighted bat before you go to the plate. What do you think? Is there an answer here with mental toughness?"

176184389,Well I was in Bulgaria when I gave up. I was there a month. I had to self Isolate for two weeks. Then We’ve been in quarantine for two weeks so I haven’t seen my friends for two months.
176184390,"In many ways now. I don’t have symptoms torturing me, I know who I am, have lovely home, have pension , have boyfriend I possibly want to marry ,not obese, have family , have friends in spirit,… My x boyfriend gothic home and three dogs was the most loving peaceful home I ever had though and I was happy there in many ways but we didn’t have sex much and I have sex more now which I love as it can be the best sex. Had great moments with the father of my unborn son when our heartsclicked and I cried on him. Riding horses with my friend _NAME_. Riding my sacred neigh. Being with _PERSON_ was nice. Being with loved ones My boyfriend makes me laugh and I think I want to marry him. Now is a good time for me."
176184391,Not sure the reference but there’s no mind police. Just people trying to maintain some order.

You could even learn some lessons for yourself. Just don’t bust everyone’s balls saying it’s not fair because from what I’ve seen in a short space of time is that it’s pretty bloody fair around here.

176184396,"8 hours of sleep is recommended however I’ve learned recently that apparently there is no real reason this is the case and that actually there seems to be wide variation in the actual best amount of sleep people need, it varies with the individual. For example I need around 11-12 hours of sleep a night to feel completely rested and be at my most mentally and emotionally healthy. My boyfriend says he only needs 6. If you are sleeping so much that you aren’t getting anything done and it’s stressing you out then yes it would probably be better to sleep a bit less but sometimes it can be hard to do so.

I freaked out because of my agoraphobia and ended up in restraints. The first symptoms were caused by oxygen deprivation. After that, I still cant openly say it didn’t happen. I hope this helps,"

176184402,"_AT_MENTION_ , I think the sza diagnosis does indeed confuse an awful lot of lay people that have this condition but it doesn’t confuse the pdoc’s who diagnose it because they diagnose this condition all of the time and they have an awful LOT of patients with this condition I may say."

176184404,"I’m one of that age group and my voices are now barely there. But the negative symptoms and cognitive decline is definitely happening. I find it more difficult to simply read a book, and I often have little to say and stare at the wall. I still struggle with obesity and although I’ve knocked my a1c down considerably it is still high in the pre-diabetic column at 6.3. (at one point it reached 6.9). I am at a group home, unemployed, and have little desire for sex, or a relationship. My aging Mother is making one last attempt to save me by paying for gym membership but I know that when something happens to her that’s it. (I would have extreme difficulty getting there on my own, or paying for it.) It’s kinda of a relief to have fewer voices but it’s like they are not necessary any more. I am more or less destroyed and their mission is accomplished."

I see that all is in the mind in fact, but i still dont control my mind … so i am very severly physically disabled too… One pdoc told me its another disorder than the sz, which i have too, but he has no clue how to help… I guess i just am stressed till hell… Plus the isolation from the years … Oh _AT_MENTION_ , i hide since 10 years but wel
l, i dont want to freak out the others too… I only bother my mom on the phone sometimes… But can you tell me why the zyprexa doesnt help the physical symptoms?

So I’m stuck with the keys in ignition going forward, which is in opposition to the contrary of stopping naltrexone I’d completely lose my mind again. For a while I thought naltrexone was possibly all I needed. Instead of 25 mg abilify 1 mg klonopin. It’s now 10 mg abilify .25 klonopin. I could probably go down but I’m not gonna. But I heal over TIME. And I need supplementary doses of abilify, klonopin and now zoloft too. But naltrexone is my primary med. with abilify now taking a back seat. Naltrexone though, has treated every problem I’ve ever had, including cognition. Which I think is it’s most remarkable gain it’s given me. Full control of my cognition back after I pretty much took an anti-cognition gun and shot myself in the head with it when I mixed shrooms, abilify, alcohol and caffeine together once
. It has healed me from that experience, and THEN some. I tried lions mane and I didn’t love how it made me feel. My dad takes it daily though for Alzheimer’s prevention and stuff.

The aim of the study was to investigate whether clinical conditions associated with mitochondrial disorders (CAMDs) were frequently present in schizophrenia.A previously used questionnaire regarding the CAMDs was administered to patients and controls in a direct interview with a trained psychiatrist. The frequencies of CAMDs in 164 patients with schizophrenia were compared to those in 156 age- and sex-matched controls.Severe fatigue, seizures, constipation and diabetes were significantly more frequent in patients with schizophrenia than in contr
ol subjects and apparently not related to pharmacological treatment.The results of the present study suggest that multi-systemic mitochondrial dysfunction may be an underlying mechanism involved in schizophrenia."

What would you talk about did rid of the _USER_ID_ and discrimination amongst the general public most of whom aren’t educated in mental illness? The _USER_ID_ has always been there even before we were born. In the past we would be put in Asylums.

174389551,"I used to be for legalization of marijuana but not anymore. Personally, I got my severe schizophrenia from pot, but I also suspect there’s more to it than that. I have no evidence, but it’s part of my delusional system and I have told it here and to my support team ad nauseum. I smoked something called skunk weed which didn’t smell like a skunk but to those who really know what it is it’s just a very, very high THC content with possibly low CBD. I smoked a lot of it – 2-3 grams in 1 sitting. I also tried high dose of _USER_ID_, monsters, alcohol, and some unknown plant I bought online. I literally lost touch of reality, felt like a living hell and nightmare. I was a zombie for several hours and thought I met God. I remember going through a white wormhole or portal. I felt like I went to outer space and crap. When I came back, I was terrified and petrified. I believed and was convinced I lived in a simulation and matrix. I had paranoia and instant DP/DR. I recovered after a week or two. Th
en, I was exercising like crazy and got it back – the severe dissociation. I don’t remember much except dropping out and sleeping all day. I must have tried to stick with the classes. I got sick early or late August before class started and I dropped out and went home I think around October or later. I made it halfway through the semester and I realized I was going to get Fs in my math courses. I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have even suspected my pot was laced with PCP, LSD, or something like that. I have no proof or evidence. My former psychologist suggested I had brain damage from spice. I don’t remember doing spice at all, but it’s possible. I don’t know how I survived. I felt like I had a stroke or almost a heart attack. I even thought I was kidnapped or taken like the Men In Black or some ????. I remember seeing two rectangular UFOs fly over me. It was scary and freaky. Like I was targeted by aliens or the Deep State. I don’t know why but I thought it had to do with a facebook pos
t(s) or something of that nature. I was a good kid in my opinion. Maybe I posted I was a time traveler, about war, or even working for the government (which I definitely do not and will never -obviously). That’s all I can think of… Not sure why aliens would come after me for anything else…Maybe because I was a computer simulator/Reptilian in a past life. I felt I couldn’t get high off pot like I was immune or had a strong sense of reality. I never would have guessed or suspected I had Aspergers or even schizophrenia, but I caught onto it early on. I even felt I went to Mars for years and ???? when I returned and was in Walgreens or CVS. I believe I’ve had numerous past lives in the millions or more. Early on, I told my doctor in the psychiatric outpatient that I went through a wormhole and was living in a parallel universe and believed and obsessed about the Matrix theory. Perhaps, they kicked me off planet Earth and sent me to a different life after I posted we lived in a simulation on Facebook. It 
certainly feels like that. Sometimes, I think I was targeted. Sometimes I think (convinced) that I was in the Montauk Project as a Montauk Boy, Monarch, and MK-Ultra. That’s what my past lives tell me and convince me of. I get dreams and daylight hallucinations and psychic thoughts that convince me of such things. I am even convinced I was in the Illuminati in a past life and hated it. Sometimes I think it was a beautiful woman I admired that did this to me, but after a billion years or lifetimes I learned from grey aliens that it was my alien genetics and my “special” past lives, two of which were _NAME_ and the other was _NAME_ born in 1930’s in apparently Austria and was taken to _NAME_ hospital as a kid and diagnosed as the first Aspergian child in world history. I also believe something horrible happened to me like a bad trip on August 27th – Saturday night. It must have been because I kept obsessing about it and felt like I had to remember permanently. Now I’m questioning the day. I feel lik
e I was told August was a very important month for them or me. I sometimes think it was August 12th instead now, after years. That’s when the Montauk Project got shut down or something…they said it’s a very important date for people. It was also a Saturday. It would have been a 10 year cycle since it happened in 1983 (30 years ago) but they say it happens every 20 years like a cycle or bio-rhythm. Maybe it was aliens and the Men in Black. The whole pretty woman thing was just a coincidence, false belief, and delusion. I am convinced and believe all drugs are bad and should be regulated and banned. Anyways, that’s what happened to me when I had a bad reaction to pot 10 years ago. I wouldn’t touch that ????. Plus, I watched on YouTube that pot can erase or undo Mind Control by activating certain parts of the brain and releasing neurotransmitters. Not recommended. After I got my marijuana card after 2011 I started getting paranoid. I was really dissociated before that and had confusion. I thought all m
y problems were from Aspergers and poor social skills and wanting to belong – to fit in. I just thought I had a bad reaction from substance induced psychosis. I really don’t remember 2013. But maybe something happened in that year too. I am convinced something happened between 2011 and 2013. I don’t remember 2012. Perhaps, me and my family were cloned. I remember some things. Perhaps, it’s because I was _NAME_ in a distant past life. I also remember and feeling I went through the big bang while traveling through outer space backwards in time and escaped the matrix. It was a riveting experience as well as a shock to the system. I believed I met God. I also have read stories from Monarch victims that MRIs bring back memories and break or make the microchip malfunction. It makes sense, but I never understood that if the microchip was so advanced, why would a silly, basic MRI affect it. Perhaps, I was designed or programmed to remember these things at specific times. I also have dreams where I was told I 
was in Project Moonshadow. I had dreams of that several months ago. I don’t remember much but I remember being terrified. I also believe I was once a worker in the Montauk Project about a billion lifetimes ago and was eventually a victim and a montauk boy when I was 22 years old. I know people don’t believe me especially schizophrenics and other conspiracy theorists. I never had hypnosis or past life regression. It’s just me forcing and triggering the memories and hell-like realities I remember. Even _PERSON_ who claimed he was in the project, started remembering after he watched the movie "" Philadelphia Experiment. Weird and strange, huh? I have a lot of memories. I am talking because I believe my traumatic experiences led to my schizophrenia and I hate it. I feel like every time I reincarnate back to 2011-2013, I have the same symptoms and experience the same reality over and over again. I barely, if at all, remember what it’s like to be normal and human – like not having schizophrenia and being 
sane. Thank you!"

174389612,"But what I am interested in is something new, along the lines of para-cognitive therapy, drawing attention to cognitions that are correct but felt to be really weird and disturbing because they are different to that which normies usually feel. For example, there are scientists that argue that our will, the normie voice of consciousness in our brain, is felt to be causal because it comes before actions, when in fact both it and the action are caused by a preceding unconscious mental event. For example when asked to press either a left or right button, FMRI brain activity that predicts the button will be pressed, is found to precede the “will” of “left” and “right” even though normies incorrectly believe their will to be causal. Now consider the case when the choice is between two bowls of fruit, apples and oranges. Presumably something about the fruit, its colours, juiciness and attractiveness, triggers some unconscious mental decision, which in turn triggers the will “apple” (or “
organge”) which causes the action. So in a sense, though normies are complete unaware of it, the apple causes the movement more than the pos-hoc (after the event) willing “apple.” When someone who is schizophrenic feels that others are reading or controlling their thoughts, this is partly because they deluding themselves into believing in some apparatus that others have implanted in their brain. This is a delusion. But it also may be partly because schizophrenics are in part right. The unconscious events that cause thoughts are triggered by the words, looks, expressions, of those around us, and are not (as normies incorrectly believe) at the start of the causal chain. There are other things like this – e.g. in the area of simulation delusion – that contain some truth, and in someways more truth than imho normies are aware of. Attempts to un-see these para-cognitive truths may make the experience of the delusions worse than they would be if they were in part accepted. Bibliography Soon, C.S., _PERSON

174389606,from my experience in the mental health field both as a professional and also as someone who was diagnosed. I thought my diagnosis was a life sentence and did not know if I would be able to work at all after it. I was also told in grad school that anyone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar should stay on medication their entire life and had that reiterated by a friend that’s a therapist after my diagnosis. What is your view?
176184761,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ , I’ve taken a look at this snapshot. On page 137, it says “Hyperprolactinaemia is often superficially asymptomatic (i.e. the patient does not spontaneously report problems ) and there is some evidence that hyperprolactinaemia does not affect subjective quality of life .” (emphasis added, _NAME_, 2018). I personally think that you are focusing too much on this issue; prolactin build-up is possible, but your argument is going against most of this article snapshot. I have quoted this in academic form for you. These are potential risks, not definite. This snapshot is talking about symptoms in women who have phantom pregnancy and referring to it as ‘delusion’ (I think that’s what it says here). False pregnancy is a known, rare psychiatric condition. If the risks of prolactin is serious, then the psychiatry field will know a lot about it. Please do not worry. The doctors will be able to prescribe with appropriation to your condition."

Y _PERSON_, X _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Song, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia research , May 2019 14 We conducted a 24-week, randomized, double-blind parallel-controlled trial to test whether buspirone is beneficial to improve cognitive deficits of schizophrenia because it remains unclear. Two hundred patients received in random order either co-treatment buspirone with AAPDs or monotherapy with AAPDs. All patients had been treated with a stable dosage of AAPDs for at least three months. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), _NAME_ Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24), and 14-item _NAME_ Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA-14) were used to evaluate clinical symptoms. The short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) was used to assess neuro
cognitive function. Social function and family burden were evaluated by Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) and Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). All patients were enrolled at baseline and followed up after 12 and 24?weeks. A total of 196 patients completed the trial, with 99 in the combined treatment group and 97 in the control group. During the intervention, the score of PANSS, HAMD-24, and HAMA-14 decreased slightly without group differences. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the two groups in the score of arithmetic, similarities, picture completion, block design, SDSS, and FBIS (P??0.05). In conclusion, co-treatment with buspirone and APPDs outperformed APPDs alone in improving cognitive deficit and reducing family burden of schizophrenia. Buspirone may be a promising candidate for co-treatment of schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits."

176184787,I feel like I am finally finding pieces to a puzzle I was unable to solve. My pschologist did a test on me to find out if I have autism (however she did not tell me she just said she wanted to find out my learning style). But when I posted about it here one of you shared a link to the exact questions she used. It was a test for autism. I used to be on meds for epilepsy up to the age of 4. They say there is some link between autism and seziures. My cousin says she thinks her dad is on the spectrum too. He also talks about feeling like an outcast and being told he was nothing more than a basket case. But he is now a qualified accountant with an MBA.

Right now, my choice is green spotted puffer Been practicing water changing in my mind before i get anything I realize that it’s basically like a toilet that needs to be changed Anyone have an aquarium at your desk?"
176184853,"Coulda, woulda, shoulda. I say finders-keepers. I don’t want to get into a moralist argument with anyone, but you’re you and it’s easy for people to armchair quarterback the situation, if need be (not that that’s happening, just saying)."

176184855,It is really an art that psychiatry. Getting a feel for people and their symptoms and figuring out what works best isn’t really scientific but takes some intelligent guessing sometimes. Thus the art.
176184856,Some days I do feel miserable. Alot lately it seems. You have to just keep your head up.hugs
176184857,I’ve lived for 31 years almost and long enough to know I have luck on my side. I have misfortune like we all do. But I am also lucky. I don’t know if that luck starts with anything but external factors. But with my stupidity I should be dead but I’m lucky I’m in pretty good shape. I hope my luck can continue. But I’m hoping it will be more skill based and less luck as I get older
176184858,I am not sure why you think people would not like you _AT_MENTION_ .
176184859,"I could definitely make more money somewhere but after thinking it over. I decided i’ll go back to work for $10/hr. hopefully 20 hours a week, preferably 5, 4 hour shifts, with 2 days off. that would give me an extra $800-850 dollars a month, before taxes, and hopefully i’ll be able to keep my Medicaid and disability for awhile. eventually I would like to go back to work full time and will demand higher pay when I do. I think this is best, I will still have free time each day, to workout and do chores around the house. all the extra money will go towards home improvements."
174389647,"No meds. I wasn’t prescribed any. No diagnoses either. Funny story; I did this twice; the first time I was diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective, the doctor eventually said that the psychosis I had was started by _PERSON_. Then, a year and a half ago, I took a little extra of a strong _PERSON_ extract, coupled with He _PERSON_, and I started sleeping for 2 hours a day."

176184866,"_AT_MENTION_ why is it then when I went through my first psychotic episode I lost all of my confidence, but overtime through trying my best have gotten alot of it back and its still a work in progress. You say confidence doesn’t change but it does my friend."
176184867,"I think that deferring the decision for one year is an excellent idea. Going to school during COVID would likely be primarily online which doesn’t provide the same educational experience as in-person learning. Also, landscaping is a really good job to have during COVID since it is an outdoor job. Good luck with whatever you decide!"
176184868,I have similar ideas. I don’t believe it can be proved or disproved
174389638,You should also look into schizophreniform disorder. It?s like a short term schizophrenia.
176184869,"TheBest: sarcosine was working for different specific issues, not this brain exhaustion thing. Also, it seemed to have a limit beyond which it no longer had more of an effect after about 8 months. The good effects it did give me got retained though (thank god). I read that it builds up in the brain over time and then you don’t need it as much anymore. That would fit my experiences."

174389643,it’s not common when i’m not severely ill i have had stuff i push off to the side in a way… it’s good you can function with that stuff on and off… horrible though really
176184871,You should always listen to your doctors peoples But I’ve been in the psychiatric system for decades.
176184872,"Not really silly words, insecurities play a very vital role in these imaginations and thoughts you see, for me mostly the things that I don’t get r the things I think about and hence why the delusions. Sometimes they are the things that I want but don’t have the courage to perform the necessary actions needed to achieve it and hence the same results. So yeah I very much agree with what you are saying"
176184873,What is it about the number five; the _PERSON_ paradox; Galois Theory; and the Pentatonic Scale; how does it differ from the number four; the Four Colour Theorem; Galois Theory (again); and the Four Basic Harmonies; can you see auras?
176184874,They won’t so demonstrate you’re taking your injections. Maybe after a while when they see you’re ok to manage you can.
174389652,It says It is possible that this gray matter loss reflects a progressive disease process irrespective of medication use or that it is contributed to by switching to clozapine treatment. The clinical improvement of most patients indicates that antipsychotic-related gray matter volume loss may not necessarily be harmful or reflect neurotoxicity.
176184875,"Less psychotic, I guess, but that’s about it. I’m not ready for ordinary life."

176184882,What are you taking?
176184883,"I’ve been given clonidine 0.1mg 2x a day to help anxiety and sleep. Pdoc never has a clue for my nightmares which are all PTSD so and failed every ??????? thing that’s supposed to help. The clonidine got me to sleep when I combined it with my xanax, which I was told not to do but I fessed up flat out after the trial 7 days and she filled it. But now I’m not sleeping again, but we are trying to decrease my short acting tramadol and I went from 6 pills a day 50mg each to 1 3x a day, and even the fentanyl patch is not helping. But we have to switch it back because the other brand i had an allergic reaction to the adhesive, but that was the only way it was going thru so got 1 or 2 more patches before insurance will let me switch back. Never thought having adhesive rip your skin open would work in your favor. Who knew?"
176184884,"I don’t want the state having a list of decision I’m allowed to make and things I am allowed to do because I have a mental illness, I don’t like blanket solutions. I want the same freedoms as everyone else. I am perfectly capable of making this decision. Just because I have a mental illness doesn’t mean I am completely insane. For now my meds work and I want to live, but I know what my life would be like if they stopped working and that life is unacceptable to me. I don’t want someone who doesn’t understand what I am going through forcing me to suffer because they think they are doing good by protecting the mentally ill."
176184885,Lol! Well at least you had some fun haha
176184886,It’s an old first generation antipsychotic not used in many parts of world. Doesn’t cause any weight gain. They use it alot here. Can cause alot of akinesthesia though
176184887,Sounds like a decent plan! Wish you well with it and think if your disciplined enough you can make it happen. More power to you!
174389656,"I have a pronounced fear that I’ll acclimatize to it and it will stop working. I only started taking the stuff because it helped with positive symptoms. The help with the damaged nerves was unexpected, but I’ll take it."

176184889,"In general I feel I’m doing pretty well right now, I’m taking good care of myself but I still struggle with avolition. It’s frustrating and sad."
176184890,I’m so sorry. Hugs.
176184891,"I don’t know what it is, i just call it restlessness, like i said, i don’t think it’s from the meds, it’s mostly a feeling in my chest."
176184892,"It is sad that they do that… I think we have a bit more of a welfare state than th US. They do try to kick people out of disability too, but not as aggressively. My diagnosis of sz would have been enough to get disability forever, i think, if i wouldnt have been as as stubborn to declare myself good enough to work parttime against their advice."
176184893,"I never had a child and I sometimes feel bad about it. I just wasn’t well enough or strong enough. Oh, well. Nobody has it all."
176184894,"Try dmg instead take it when needed like for example during heavy workout days, stressful days etc. These are not supplements meant to be taken daily. Dmg is the mildest version of sacrosine but works with no side effects. Tmg is next best."
174389658,Does anybody taking clozapine here? How your experience with it?
176184895,"10mg Strattera in the morning, 10mg Zyprexa and 1000mg Depakote at night. 20mg Propranalol 3 times daily. I’m a big fan of Zyprexa."
176184896,i would creat website xD.
174389649,Not everyone has voices so it’s not outside the realms of possibility. Really it’s about function. If your suffering in life and it’s affecting how you live then it’s a problem that usually means medications.

176184899,Doctors and other med providers treat symptoms with medications.
174389660,"Someone very wise replied to me “normal people dont have to ask themselves this question” when i told her “i doubt my diagnosis”. Its part of the illness. Its like on shutter island when she says “and if i say im not crazy? Well that hardly helps does it?”. All of us who doubt the dx need to learn to trust what a doctor says. I have good days and on those days i feel like i need to be sick or i feel the reality must be that im some sort of monster for being on disability when i dont need it. But the illness is not in my control. I have good days and bad days, sometimes both on the same day. If you weren’t schizophrenic and was misdiagnosed you probably wouldnt be worrying about the misdiagnosis in the first place. You would just get on with your life."

174389671,I would be honest that suicide is something that has been on your mind but you’re not planning on doing it. I personally obsess about suicide if I don’t take Rexulti. My old pdoc knew about that and didn’t hospitalize me over it. This way your pdoc can see you need an ad right away. Good luck. I hope it goes smoothly for you.

176184933,The way I see T.V. is like everybodies mommy and daddy is about their mommy doing something instead of their daddy. It’s about hating the real world. It’s about hating reality T.V. The way I see it is that I’m so angry about the Real World that T.V. as a mirror is like my psychopathological mind. I hate an _NAME_ nemesis like it’s a cartoon. There are thousands of thoughts about hating something based on the percieved seperation in groups that one group does better than another group around watching T.V.

174389663,"I’m 59 years old. I spent 8 months in the hospital in 1982. Got out and got pretty stable but relapsed in 1989 (even though I had been taking my medication as prescribed) and I had about 4 or 5 brief hospitalizations. Then I had a streak from 1990-2015 without hospitalizations (25 years). In 2015, my mom died and the fact I lost my housing at the same time and the stress of having to make two 150 mile trips by myself on the spur of the moment to be with my mom and driving by myself all over a strange city I didn’t know going back and forth to the hospital in her last days was too much for me. I drove 150 miles home and the next night I got suicidal and ended up in the hospital. Being in the hospital at age 55 sucked and was scary but I don’t regret driving all over to be with my mom before she died. So my mom died and I lost my housing and ended up in the hospital for two days after staying out for 25 years. At the same time I was having serious back problems which kept me in continuous pain. 
The result of the hospitalization was I had to take two months off of work. I also had to quit school and after living independently in “normal society” from 1995-2015 I had to move back into mental health housing which was a board & care home. I eventually ended up in my current apartment where I’ve been for the past 2 1/2 years. I rent from a mental health agency and I’m on my own except for a counselor who visits for an hour once every three weeks. I have been back in college taking one online class at a time while here. I have my car which I got in 2015, I’ve also been back to work since 2016, in fact a year after that last hospitalization I won an “Employee of the Year” award at my job which was a cool plaque and a gift card. I’m pretty independent now; I go to work, take care of my car, take care of my own finances, grocery shop for myself, do my half of the cleaning in the apartment, and pretty much take care of any business that comes up myself which can be anything from dealing with S
ocial Security to dealing with my car insurance company or dealing with the DMV to shopping for clothes and dealing with difficult, sadistic neighbors. My old tagline on here used to be “The Comeback Kid” for awhile, and after that it was “Kicking life’s ass with zero confidence”. Well, I earned both of those and they were true for awhile. Now, I’m slowly being driven mad by seriously disturbed, psychopathic neighbors who just don’t care. It’s time to move on and start over and look for different housing and hopefully maybe in my new place I’ll have better luck with neighbors and they’ll have a little common decency and won’t try to take advantage of my naturally good nature. I can only pray. I’m sorry, I don’t want to end on such a negative note. A lot of my life is pretty positive; I still like my janitor job after being there 7 years. In fact when my seven year anniversary at my job came up in June I was surprised and pleased to find a $500 bonus in my paycheck! In fact, not only 
do I not owe anybody a dime but I have a few thousand dollars “extra” I’ve saved up in the bank to do whatever I want with. I have my sisters for support and we meet once a week to hike in a nearby park. I’m lucky to have my car, I can go wherever I want but due to the virus I limit the places I go to running errands and going out to eat whenever I want at the many fast food joints around here. I am not friends with my roommate, but he spends the time in his room and I get the living room to myself and he’s quiet and does his half of the cleaning without me asking so I’m pretty satisfied with him. I have started taking walks occasionally, and I met with my nutritionist last week and hopefully she’ll do her job and help me lose weight. I’ve had schizophrenia since I was 19; I’ve had it 40 years but I’m the nicest guy you’ll meet. My motto is that “If you give me half a chance I’ll be nice to you, but you also have to give me a chance to defend myself.” My humor has survived intact t
hese past 40 years, I say the same stuff at my job or to my sisters or to anyone else within earshot that I say here (minus the schizophrenia jokes, lol). I still have symptoms but I have a little curiousness about life sometimes, I have my little adventures, I have my moments where I do cool things. People in general endlessly frustrate me; they’re manipulators and opportunists but I still get pleasure from being around them. I’ll help my co-workers or my sisters or you guys with stuff I’ve learned in my 59 years. And accept help back! I guess this is all I’m going to say right now. It’s 4:00 am and tomorrow is work and I’m looking forward to it. Life is boring sometimes and anti-climatic but it ain’t all bad, I have many good moments every day and expect that to continue to be true indefinitely. My plan is to keep putting one foot in front of the other and tackle any problems that come up like I’ve done for years and my hope is alive and well. I wish you guys all good luck and i wish myself 
good luck. Take care!"

176184954,"I think we are living in a matrix world or God is able to send us messages. Today for example, I saw a license plate that said silver bullet. Half hour later I received an email with “no silver bullet” in the title. Maybe it was because I thought about suicide earlier in the day, who knows? All I know is I have had these crazy coincidences happen a lot. Another example, I had the delusion that someone wanted me to move to DC. So I said out loud I want to see a DC license plate. Couple hours later I saw one at lunch. I live in the Midwest and DC plates are real rare. Haven’t seen one since. Maybe it’s synchrocity, maybe it’s God, maybe it’s the matrix. Who knows. One thing is they don’t make sense why they happen and don’t match up to reality. Maybe it’s glitches in a matrix, I don’t know. Don’t worry I’m not thinking about hurting myself"

174389672,I had memories problems on risperidone. When somebody told me something I would forget it 5 min later. A friend if mine who is on 9 mg Invega seems to forget everything most of the time.

We may sometimes believe we are, but we’re not. Instead of just denying and ignoring the violently psychotic, we need to get people to understand that the psychotic brain can get so twisted and chaotic that the commonly accepted laws of morality and ethics may become all but lost on it. We need to get people to understand that living in psychosis is like living in another world, and that sometimes, a psychotic soul is not responsible for their actions."

176184970,I don’t have any friends to hang out with or chat with . But I have one girl I email once a year or so but we feel pretty distant though we used to be best friends but she has children married work etcmaybe we are still.but we don’t have much contact. I have my x boyfriend in Sweden I call sometimes but he doesn’t have internet I see him as one of my best friends. We can go a couple years with no contact and still be cool. I have a Muslim guy who said I’m his best friend and he is so nice n funny but he will not answer my email.maybe his religion says we can’t be friends. I had a chat friend I wrote with every morning and night but he dumped me that we are nolonger friends. I had a girl in Sweden who dumped me. My x boyfriend in SA is my favourite man.best man I ever met n I hope to be his friend n fan but he doesn’t write to me really n if he does he is very short he sometimes says thank you if I bought him a gift. He never wants me back. The closest I have to a friend is a few emails o
r a few phone calls a year. I don’t have friends as such yet I do have friends because I see them as my friends just not hang out friends. I would love to have friends to chat etc maybe hang out but I need lots of alone time. Many didn’t want to be friends because I don’t work and have no ambition. Some dumped me when I was Muslim for a year. Others if I was behaving strange. I’m grateful for my friends but we don’t have much contact. We barely have any contact.

176185035,"Normally this time of year I take a turn for the worse. There’s a seasonal aspect to what goes on with me, I’ve never been diagnosed with SAD but it’s sort of like that. It normally starts pretty abruptly in October and just gets worse to the point that I can’t function. Here it is November and I don’t feel much different. I really feel that it’s because of the 120 mgs of Cymbalta that I’m taking. I’m hoping to avoid the worst of the seasonal depression this year and keep my head above water, it would be so nice. The only problem is that if I do start to feel depressed I’m already maxed so there’s little to be done as far as medicine goes. But there’s therapy, exercise, meditation, and just taking care of myself that can help."
176185036,"I see. A doctor told me if I was stable for a year without a episode I could give it a go. I guess docs have different opinions. Who knows what is best. Yeah I’m stable, but I have developed drug dependent insomnia. If I skip the medication one day for whatever reason I will likely get zero sleep, and when I don’t sleep my mind starts racing, so I have to be very careful taking drugs at the right time every day so I don’t have a insomnia night. It can be useful to take a break from supplementing and start fresh to figure out what benefits you and not. I think vit. D is important, but recently learned that it should be taken together with vit. K2 to avoid complications, at least if you take it long term. I just ordered some K2, it’s expensive but I figure it’s worth it. I’m experimenting with taurine and gaba at the moment. So far I feel they are making me feel more normal. I might post about it after trying it out for a while."

176185079,I was wondering has anyone been to the hospital recently? If so how was your experience?
176185080,"My symptoms are bothering because I have a bad mood all the time , I want to do anything … I’m tired all the time . My mood is bad all the time… To take care of myself? yes, A bit.

176185081,"Found the following interesting excerpt on the internet. My own experience of paranoia can be succinctly described as using language games. Effectively, my paranoia consisted of the idea that everyone was playing language games and that the object that people were referring to for certain words was me. What I found was that my perception of how people conversed became reduced to the simple rules of a language game, and I was an unwilling participant in this game. The problem was that these games were not harmless communication but used as a way of persecuting me. One reason that I may have had the perception that this was happening was that at some point I began to feel that what people meant could not be accounted for in the usual sense. So I resorted to analyzing people’s conversations in terms of a language game. It is possible that my emotional fear of being singled out is what caused me to no longer understand things in their normal way. In any case, any word that could be taken as referring 
to me, even by oblique references, was interpreted that way. For example, mentioning “America” could be taken to mean “Am _NAME_,” ie, a coded reference to someone who thinks he’s a woman. I would then take that to mean that the group accepted that this referred to me, with people using gestures, nods, and smiles to confirm to each other that I was the intended reference."

Yes, I was venting- it helps to get my frustration out and also get help from others. Thankfully a therapist is going to see me from the 29th to work on my trauma and C-PTSD. I’m starting to feel a little hopeful that I don’t have to repeat patterns of letting myself down in low self-esteem. I’ve tried so hard to get my trauma resolved but due to how long it is, but my past therapist that it may as well take more than 5-10 years because it’s so deeply engrained.

I was thinking about your benefits question. I did job searching for the first 5 months of this year.

For example if it’s a 0.5 position, the work hours are 50% of full time, the paid leave is 50% of full time and the paid sick leave is 50% of full time. Presumably health benefits would be pro rata?

176185159,"You can make a weighted blanket at home easily. Take two pieces of fleece, line them up, and sew them together on the outsides. then buy a bunch of those little bags of dried beans/lentils at the store. Whatever is cheapest, the type makes no difference. Mark how big one bag of lentils is, then sew lines into your fleece big enough to fit the bags. You’ll make tubes in the fabric. Then you cut open the top of the tubes and slide in however many bags of lentils you need to equal 10% of your body weight. When it’s time to wash the blanket, just take the bags out. I used to do this all the time for the special needs school I worked at. If you’re pretty small, you can split the bags of lentils into ziploc bags so you can more evenly distribute the weight along the blanket. If you want to get more advanced, instead of tubes you can sew like little pockets for the bags to go into. If you do that, remember to leave a lip at the top of each pouch to keep the bags from falling back out."

174389725,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ""I just don't look forward to anything"". How anticipatory pleasure and negative beliefs contribute to goal-directed activity in patients with negative symptoms of psychosis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Schizophrenia research, May 2020 07 Anticipatory pleasure refers to a state of positive affect in anticipation of future events that has been found to motivate goal-directed behavior. Previous research has indicated that patients with negative symptoms of psychosis show reduced goal-directed behavior because 'demotivating beliefs' impede anticipatory pleasure. This study aims to link demotivating beliefs and anticipatory pleasure to patients' motivation in everyday life. Using the Experience Sampling Method, we examined the motivational process of goal-directed activity in the daily lives of 35 patients with negative symptoms and 36 healthy controls. We tested whether the mechanism underlying goal-directed behavior differs between patients and healthy controls and whether demoti
vating beliefs interfere with goal-directed behavior by impeding anticipatory pleasure. Multilevel analyses revealed that anticipatory pleasure mediated the association between goal-intentions and goal-directed activity in both groups (indirect effects: 24-30%). In the patient group, however, the association between social goal-intentions and anticipatory pleasure was weaker (b?=?-0.09, SE?=?0.05, p???.01, [-0.17;-0.04]) than in the controls, but this was not found for goal-intentions related self-care or recreational activites. Also, demotivating beliefs were more pronounced in the patient sample. (F(1,70)?=?72.11, p???.001) and moderated the effect of goal-intentions on anticipatory pleasure for social activities in the whole sample (b?=?-0.12, SE?=?0.05, p???.01, [-0.20;-0.08]). Our results support the assumption that a set of demotivating beliefs prevents patients with negative symptoms from looking forward to social activities and thus provide a possible psychological explanation for the social withdrawa
l of patients with negative symptoms."

Especially remotely, to me the lectures are kinda useless when I can just read the book and go through the slides myself, and then see the professors at office hours when I have trouble with assignments.

The aps make me dumber too tbh… And in my illness, there is my intellectual deficits of which I am very aware so I am scared of the others on that… I talk not about recovery, but about a bit of more remission, you know… To just be able to talk to my ill friend on the phone in the evening, not avoid… I make more things now, that I fight, but I am still very often quite alone…I wonder if there can be a faster remission no matter, that I was ill and isolated for twenty years?

There was a lava flow that destroyed some towns where people lived, but I don’t think anyone got hurt. They just lost their property. My problem with going to Kauai is that everything is expensive. Half the hotels I found were $500 per night! We found a cheaper place in a nice town that is supposed to have good shaved ice.

176185211,Welcome. I hope you like it here.
176185212,I know you have been told by others on here to do the 3 week thing but I will have to say it made all the difference for me. I even went from 234 to 156 or whatever the next lowest dose is and it was working fine for me. More doesn’t mean it will last longer but I take invega pills now and don’t have to worry about off weeks.
176185213,I would work on getting insurance and finding a pdoc that can help you. You are taking a big risk by not having a doctor.
176185214,"Constipation is rough. I’m sorry you’re experiencing it. I would consider trying an over the counter laxative if it’s not contraindicated by your condition or any other medications you’re taking. Eating lactose when you’re lactose intolerant acts as an osmotic diuretic. If that worked, then an over the counter laxative will likely work for you too but in a safer and controlled manner. I would avoid any foods to which you have an intolerance or which normally irritate your bowel."
176185215,Thanks _AT_MENTION_!
176185216,"I’m in the ER right now. My husband couldn’t come back with me which makes me really upset. The doctor told me that if I’m admitted to the psych hospital to go inpatient, I won’t be allowed any visitors because of COVID-19. I want help but I don’t think I could handle not seeing my husband for a week or more. Last year, when I was inpatient, my husband visited me every evening and we talked on the phone sometimes, too. I don’t think I can do this; I won’t even be able to say goodbye to him if I get admitted."

If you did it right and exactly,the problem that remain existed is that,the therapist has no interest to treat these things that cause your main suffering ,because he does not has actual data about these things And they does not exist as a target in the treatment plan In most cases,he thinks that,these things are empty speech,mythological imaginations , unreal things or it is your own thoughts / feelings and culture that invent your suffering ( effect’s severity of the phonetic emitter (hallucination) on the receptors is greater than the effect of inhibiting factors And it imprinting a false metal concep

176185285,I’ve been told that my drawings are suitable for children’s books. I would have to take a look at the _NAME_ series.
174389751,"I dunno, some aspects are looking a lot like Lumateperone’s results at this stage. “The substantial improvements in the PSP scale with the 64 mg dose are tremendously encouraging. These study results represent a very important outcome in a study of a potential treatment of negative symptoms, one of the most important drivers of everyday disability and a critical unmet medical need for patients with schizophrenia. The consistency in treatment effects, in terms of overall negative symptoms and of the most important subtype, reduced emotional experience, between the previous Phase 2b study and the current one is encouraging. The increased placebo effect from the first to second study seems to be the only reason that the study did not meet its primary endpoint.” “We are encouraged by the results obtained in this study which expand upon the outcome of the Phase 2b study that showed improvements in the primary endpoint and in multiple secondary endpoints,” said Dr. _PERSON_, Executive Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer of _NAME_. “Even though this study didn’t achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints, primarily due to a larger than expected placebo effect at Week 12, results obtained with the 64 mg dose including the early onset of effect and functional improvement as measured by PSP suggest roluperidone merits continued investigation for the treatment of primary negative symptoms. We intend to consult with the US FDA about the next steps in the development of roluperidone for this indication after we complete the analysis of the study data."
174389746,"Did you experience these? Did clozapine help with them? People may experience: Behavioral: disorganized behavior, aggression, agitation, hostility, hyperactivity, hypervigilance, nonsense word repetition, repetitive movements, restlessness, self-harm, social isolation, lack of restraint, or persistent repetition of words or actions Cognitive: thought disorder, confusion, belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, belief that thoughts aren’t one’s own, disorientation, racing thoughts, slowness in activity, thoughts of suicide, unwanted thoughts, difficulty thinking and understanding, or false belief of superiority Mood: anger, anxiety, apathy, excitement, feeling detached from self, general discontent, limited range of emotions, loneliness, or nervousness Psychological: fear, hearing voices, depression, manic episode, paranoia, persecutory delusion, religious delusion, or visual hallucinations Speech: deficiency of speech, excessive wordiness, incoherent speech, or rapid and

176185291,_AT_MENTION_ That’s the thing though. I’ve worked overnight before and I like it. Plus I do feel it would be easier for me to work then go to school without trying to sleep a little in between. When I try to do that I never really wake up. But I’m fine if I’m already awake. And it would be nice because at night my anxiety is at its worst. Unless I’m doing something. It flares up when I try to sleep at night. So working at night would keep anxiety away and I’m fine sleeping during the day. _AT_MENTION_ I am going to do it as a trial and talk to my employer and ask if it isn’t working out that I’d be able to switch back to days. _AT_MENTION_ I know. I will be fine as long as stress is manageable as I don’t have symptoms unless my stress gets to an unmanageable point. Hasn’t happened yet since I’ve been better but I feel myself heading towards that point which is why I’m getting a different job.

174389753,Its a lifelong illness. Its dangerous without meds especially if you were already on meds because the brain gets adapted to meds. Some go as far as killing others and/or themeselves when unmedicated. I was close to die drs said when I stopped my meds. They transferred me from the poison emergency to a mental hospital. I wasn’t functional and completely socially isolated when I stopped my meds. I was talking to myself.
176185302,"I have been getting really poor sleep. Feels now like the time has come where I need to sort it out What happens to me is I fall asleep ok, because I am exhausted. Then I will awake from whatever twisted memory of this that or the other, or who, and be re-traumatised every night of my existence during this time period. This means I cannot go back to sleep, as frankly, I am not having a good time of it at all I will be awake after just a few hours of sleep. My anger goes through the roof about how I dealt with previous misgivings, and my mind seems intent on torturing me over these things. It feels like these people have literally opened a back door into my psyche, and are pulling at strings until one snaps. This is deeply unsettling to me, and I cannot put up with this The Psychiatrist blamed the Sertraline, but all he knew was that I wasn’t sleeping. The above he is not aware of. I cannot communicate with my case manager. He listens to 10% of what I say, and forgets or ignores 90% of it. I do no
t trust him any more. Just got off the phone to the crisis line, and I told them I had been playing with knifes. They put me through to a Nurse, and she just talked ???? and deflected the issues at hand. I do not think it was a useful conversation. Not very impressed. She says she will email my treatment team. I told her they’re all away on holiday for three weeks. Then she said duty worker on Tuesday. How the ???? can I wait that long? This has been going on for pretty much 2021, and I am getting sick of it. These people must think I am just a dripping tap with a bucket that just needs emptying once in a while on a phone call. It’s pathetic."
176185303,Anxiety paranoia not being able to sleep and if I do not enough sleep
176185304,This morning I wanted to catch a morning nap. I asked Google what time it was and it was 11 am. I fell asleep and when i woke up i asked the time and it was 11:13 am. I fell asleep again and when i woke up I asked again. 11:31 am. I finally just got up. So weird.

174389758,"Yeah, and this student is only 18 years old. I think he said he was diagnosed at the age of 14, or maybe he said 15, something like that."
176185310,Three months is how long you wait to see your pdoc if you are asymptomatic and stable on your meds.
176185311,_AT_MENTION_. I’m with you but I wanna have it taken to another step I wanna be used as nourishment for a beautiful flower bearing tree Add on: or roses
176185312,See now no one can trust what you say since you said you faked psychosis. You’re selfharming.
174389760,I take that too. It does nothing. My Dr think I am depressed so he prescribed it. It didn’t help.
176185313,"I also thought about becoming a nun for a while but I have a physical disability. May God bless you. You may also want to join the Catholic Answers Forum. We’ve got a separate section for vocations. Are you thinking of Benedictine or Carmelite orders? I assume that it might be a personal matter so I will not ask more questions. For university…I would suggest you to talk to a spiritual counselor if any religious needs are necessary. Also, special accommodations are really helpful. Communicate often with your English professors and ask if you have any questions. Also, discernment is not an easy task! Talk to a priest should you stumble on anything religious and talk to us if you struggle with mental health issues. Blessings."
176185314,The job interview is next week. I’m sort of excited. And nervous at the same time. Idk what to expect! I will prepare for it. A bit. I hope it goes well…
176185315,Yes I agree. It’s time to get some clarity.
176185316,"Don’t talk to me, you make no sense at all."
176185317,"Lol Funny stories. I had a girl in mental hospital that wanted sex at night many times. She came to my bed sitting next to me. I felt uncomfortable and rejected her. She gave me her phone number but I never called her. I think she called me once but I made myself that I didn’t know her and hung up. If I ever saw ppl from mental hospital it wouldn’t change a thing for me, I would still prefer staying in bed. They’re just like regular ppl for me so I bond with them just like I bond with normal ppl, not more easily."
174389761,"Just don’t give up seeking better treatment Every time I was not happy with a med, my old pdoc wanted me on Clozapine. I rejected that every time, and forced him to try all the ones we could until a balance was struck with Amisulpride in the end"
174389763,"Actually you not need ablify to do that. If you have insight then you can ask pdoc to lower your current AP dose. You might get hyper, paranoia etc which you need to manage by insight, psychology etc."
176185318,I did learn how _AT_MENTION_ . But I gained no confidence.
176185319,did you start vraylar after inveg
176185320,I weigh 121kgs. I really need to lose weight.
176185321,She told me that because i have tardive dyskinesia (which she didn’t verify) that all antipsychotics will cause me side effects and will keep me at this dose. Isn’t the precedure to switch antipsychotic? Because being lowered to 150mg of seroquel is pretty useless. I was just as psychotic when i started.
176185322,"_PERSON_ academy is great! I’m not a big fan I prefer edx and coursera though. I do think khan academy is great for kids and beginners though. I think I could learn a lot from him though especially about electronics and physics and circuits and EE. He has good content, but the videos take a lot of patience and motivation to watch especially for me."
176185323,"I just saw this thread _AT_MENTION_ ! Things will get better, I’m sure of this. Maybe you are depressed or feeling down."
176185324,Yeah. It’s a good example how messed up the nhs is. Very outdated systems or practices sometimes. It’s why I don’t rely on drs anymore.
176185325,That’s great. You have a very kind case manager. I’m glad it worked out
176185326,"Trying and failing is better than not having tried at all. And it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you for not succeeding, or that you didn’t try hard enough. It’s an illness, and I think we all know that it’s often not under our own control. When I read about people who have tried, and are now comfortable with not trying to recover any more, I don’t blame them or think they’re doing anything wrong. It’s good to try your best and then be comfortable with what you have rather than chastising yourself for having “given up”."
174389759,Going back on for sure. Can’t stand my self on something else. Clozapine is relief for soul…
176185327,when i’m doing well i make some music… but lately i been finding it hard to concentrate again so haven’t done any music lately… but i should get back to working on music as soon as i can concentrate again…
176185328,That’s cuz a cigarette has an end. Vaping has a constant reply button.

176185330,"I’ve got this problem. When I’m showering or wearing headphones, or otherwise can’t hear anything, I keep thinking I hear people calling for me. No symptom increases otherwisw, that I’ve noticed anyways. Is this just a normal part of schizoprenia for me, or might I need a med increase?"
176185331,You need phenibut. It’s gaba that crosses the bbb. If that’s what you’re looking for.
176185332,I eat vegetarian and sometimes go for a walk. Or cycle on my exercise bike.
176185333,That is gorgeous! I love how the fire is not destroying the flower
176185334,Be quite tall and well built . Add a loud voice that gets louder when you’re passionate about something( my voice just seems normal to me in terms of loudness) This is ASD related I think . I’m not sure whether it also can apply to sz or sz-a .
176185335,As soon as you feel better you need to find work only way out of the situation is to pay for your own medication because it seems the free system doesnt work from what you describe. Meds are expensive though
176185336,"That is why I said, in your case this may be the way."
176185337,Bumpidy bump bump buuuuump
176185338,What do you mean by mind control?
176185339,"I have some bitterness about both what I’ve lost in the last 13 years and what I will lose in the future. I’ve been trying to forgive myself and others I blame (due to delusional thoughts), as well as trying to take a more gentle view on who I am now and what I should expect of myself. There is a lot of wisdom in not comparing yourself to others, only to yourself yesterday. Also I find myself listening to the Tao Te Ching and find it’s surrendering to nature theme very calming. I still have my bad days though."
176185340,A good therapist can help but like _AT_MENTION_ said if you are unwilling to see a therapist there are lots of books and workbooks on the subject of child sexual abuse. You can start taking some of that power back. It’s never too late _AT_MENTION_
176185341,What I’m trying to say is I dont think they are real popular for someone to call them. So if you dont have them they may not really be necessary in the first place.
176185342,"Well then, can I make a new topic with a poll about whether or not to ther should be a rule that CW should be added to sexual topics?"
176185343,Did it give you any initial side effects? Like insomnia or aggitation?
176185344,Will _PERSON_ or _NAME_ as they’d both be hilarious. _NAME_ as he’s a living legend
176185345,"I am on such a pitiful dose of olanzapine, yet I’m still exhausted and sedated most of the time"
176185346,Well done _AT_MENTION_ . Hope it works out for you but really great to see you do well with the interview.
176185347,I’m impressed that made it through the filter. Congratulations on your win.

176185351,"ok, i’ll try to get a hold of my daughter"
176185352,There is no test for how long you’ll live. I know obese smokers and drinkers who live long and super healthy people who die young. I just put the test up for interest sake.

176185356,"I can’t set goals and attain them. I live randomly, I eat whenever I feel to, I sleep whenever I feel to and I play video games whenever I feel to. I can’t set schedules and respect them. I am taking my meds. Meds don’t seem to help."

They use to vibe or shock a spot on my head to tell me that was where there frequency was coming from. It’s just hallucinations."
176185360,How long do they stay up ?
176185361,"Why can’t you sleep? Is it anxiety, stress, medication withdrawal???"
174389762,Yeah try to avoid the energy drinks _AT_MENTION_. Kudos to you for trying to improve your health

174389772,"Is there anyone who has gone off meds for a number of years and then back on meds? I was diagnosed when I was 16 with schizophrenia and was heavily medicated by a dr and then I stopped cold turkey when I was 22. I caught my self last year answering back to one of my “friends” and took a few anxiety meds my gf had so I could pass out. I am 30 now and have full conversations with multiple “friends” . I am terrified of going back To a dr, I work in an industry where safety is key and there’s no way in hell my boss or fired bosses can find out… Any advise appreciated"

176185382,There’s a waiting list for therapy where I live. I’ve been waiting for 7 months to see someone to talk to. I would love to talk to someone. For me it’s really helpful.

174389770,Thanks for that. I thought they were the same thing.
174389765,I have had schizophrenia since I was 30. I missed work but managed to keep my job. I ended up on the company disability plan for almost a year when I was in my 50’s. I was given something like CBT to transition back to work. It helped me a lot. I recommend it. Now I am old enough thst I could retire if I wanted you. But I would.miss the social aspects of the job. Most of my oldest friends are deceased. So the social part is important.
176185383,"It sounds unfair, but I doubt there will come much good of it if you try to tell them that you’re not the only one or something like that, that might just make the situation worse. If you want the job I guess I would just try to make the adjustments they want you to do and hope that they get off your back. Maybe try not to take it personal even if it seems unfair."

176185422,Delusion. How could your political opinions have that much of an impact on anything? It wouldn’t.
176185423,Honestly. We flag ourselves sometimes. I’ve done it and seen others do it too. We are just people and often you revisit things you sometimes have to make a call on quickly. I’ve flagged my own stuff on reflection. I haven’t flagged anyone else though…I think that is against our union which you have to join when you become a mod.

176185425,I had a choice when I was diagnosed. Live on benefits or work. I was homeless sleeping in my sisters loft and the benefits took months to come through. After 6 months I found out my accommodation would only be for a year in supported housing. I flipped and moved back to my parents and started working with family. 6 years on I am tired of it all and contemplating killing myself as I am not in a financial position to be on benefits unless I undo all the hard work I have done for all that time. I have no idea how I am going to tackle this dilemma.

I cant have more than a cup of coffee/day and only in the morning, otherwise it makes me irritable and nervous, sometimes I can get violent. I can get violent off meds as well.

If I have to, I’ll have my pdoc prescribe an alternative additional med to the 8 mg of Fanapt I take twice a day."

It makes sense that you want to die. You want the pain to end. You are being tortured, and you can not endure. However, death is not the answer. The pain can be alleviated, and you can find relief without death. It was smart to take a leave of absence. Can you extend it? Are you able to return to work on Monday? I’m sorry your mom is sick. Have you looked into assisted living yet? Do you know what you are looking for? Is assisted living definitely the plan? The whisper is called a voice. It is a hallucination. It is not real. It is smart not to listen to it. You still have insight. That is a very good thing. I understand you are afraid of reality breaking. We don’t know if it will. It might, but it might not.

Have been practicing reading and writing Chinese and Japanese too, it comes naturally to me. Wrote a prescription for my stubborn bonsai tree and managed to get some medicine for it which is great. Hopefully it will work. It’s an oak I think. The problem with my yarrow stick desire is that I only really divine from a text when lying in bed practicing yoga at my computer and so yarrow sticks are impractical both from a positional point of view and a timing one.

When I did not give my US social security number this phone interview ended and they said they mail me their questions. A few weeks after the phone call I received their questions. I never returned their forms.

174389806,"""Aggressive behavior and impulsivity are often found in paranoid schizophrenia and can occur during both acute and chronic phases of the illness. Impulsivity is defined as action without planning or reflection, and it seems to be related to a failure of behavioral filtering outside of consciousness. Patients with schizophrenia may show dysfunctional impulsivity and impulsive aggression. Although the neurobiological aspects of aggression in patients with schizophrenia are still not well understood, impulsivity and aggression may correlate with frontal and temporal brain abnormalities"" Psychiatric Times Aggression and Impulsivity in Schizophrenia Aggressive and impulsive behaviors in schizophrenia pose many clinical challenges. The best way to reduce the risk of aggression is with adequate treatment of schizophrenia."

However switching from olanzapine to aripiprazole was fairly easy. I had problems with the aripiprazole, at 10mg it didn’t get my symptoms to a manageable level and I had strong akathisia. I also didn’t lose any weight. In fact since I stopped olanzapine I’ve put on 30kg.

You’ve inspired me to try eating a diet of 80 percent fruit and veges to alkalize my body again. Also my dad had a friend who had a water alkalizer and I tried drinking a litre in the day which I didn’t notice but during the night my voices were really loud so I drank another litre and as I drunk it they instantly became quieter.

I was so calm and peaceful under my religious delusions, but now, since I’m in reality, I worry a lot, especially with slipping into psychosis again. But don’t worry, I still very much like being in reality. I’m actually still struggling with my religious delusions here recently. I keep thinking that God has been telling me to isolate myself, stop talking about certain topics, and to self-improve in extreme ways. It’s like I’m in between two worlds; one in reality and one in fiction. Anyway, I’ve just thought a lot about the me then compared to the me know, and it’s pretty striking the difference, definitely since I gained like 165 pounds."

174389833,"Yes, I used to have such hallucinations quite often. Light shows, things looking rubbery, objects breathing. They tended to follow my movements, but moving around or rubbing my eyes didn’t make them go away, so I wasn’t sure whether or not they were hallucinations. I’m still not entirely sure, but I don’t have them anymore now that I’m stable on meds, so they were most likely caused by schizophrenia in some way, shape, or form."
174389825,"As far as I know, I’ve been violent towards myself by multiple suicide attempts during psychosis. But never to another person."
176185578,I don’t have a job. I just sit around all day. I wish I was motivated to do something.
176185579,Abruptly. I used AP and benzos for anxiety/trauma and when i quit them cold turkey (because nobody ever told me to taper) i got psychotic suddenly. I also got pressured by cps at the time to hand over my child to my psychopathic ex for visitation because “a psychopath can be a nice dad too” (cps employee). That didnt help much with the psychosis.

176185585,"and shudder? Do you ever get flashes of what you did and think how terrifying? How embarrassing? How tragic? or in my case a couple of times, funny? Like the time I got brought home with a hand full of worms and an old baby doll I found, soaking wet from the rain and they had to throw me in the tub to warm me up. I remember one time I almost attacked my meds management nurse when I was psychotic. I was screaming so loud that everyone in the building could hear me. I remember watching myself from across the room. I remember the Director coming in and introducing herself, it really scared me because she has my same name and I thought it was a voice because my eyes were closed and I was crying so hard. They decided to hospitalize me."
176185586,"maybe google natural ways. I find activities (e.g. exercise) work better than pills. for example instead of taking a suppliment alone, ‘do something’ to increase it like: Eat Less Saturated Fat. … Consume Probiotics. … Exercise Often. … Get Enough Sleep. … Listen to Music. … Meditate."
176185587,"I am from England, where majority of healthcare is free for the citizens, which live in England. You have to pay for your prescriptions, If you are on welfare benefits the prescriptions would be free. In England to get a mental health assessment is free. England’s healthcare system has a lot of delays, because there is such a demand to see any kind of doctor. I reccomend anyone with a mental health condition should take their medication, so it prevents you from relapsing. The side effects might be hard to deal with on a daily basis, but you have to think about your mental health. Psychosis can make people do things, which they would not do, when people are well."
176185588,I use it for anxiety and didn’t feel a difference between 10mg and 20mg.

176185590,Good idea _AT_MENTION_ . Should I delete my last comment?
176185591,I was interested in psychology and psych meds after my diagnosis.

174389830,Its about what I did when I used to go to the gym while on Abilify. I did it 3-4x/week.
176185593,May be try benzodiazepines Like bromazepam or lorazepams May god heals you

I haven’t met many other people for whom it went away though, many people seem to still be struggling with it 10 or more years into the illness. I wish I could help somehow.

176185602,"_AT_MENTION_ well then I’ll give you I’ve done the white noise, soothing crap, etc. The pdoc I have now is better than my last 3 from same health clinic in 7 years, so I’m going with her. Everybody wants to act like medications are the answer, or the opposite is the answer. I unfortunately, have no luck with either. I got a genetic mutation ???? without lubes, and the full Genesight test did for all my conditions. So we’re trying but genetics are against me. And I’m gonna stick to my pain management plan, they had me go back up to full dose of additional pain meds. Still not sleeping, but a tiny bit more comfortable. Oh, and we’re dealing with waiting for my kids Covid results cause he caught it from the ??????? school and health dept contacted us to do the tracing, he has only been home and school. They announced on the news that we had 2 positive cases first day of school, parents deemed needed to know by school district were told after 5pm Friday. The district says they will not give 
out which schools have positive kids, so facebook parents have ratted out being notified. My kids were not within what the school deemed close enough to contact, but they are 2.5 feet apart in classes. In fact he had a kid pull his mask away from his face and ??????? sneezed on my kids face in class, teacher saw, school said nothing. Oh and the district tried to hide that though my older 2 are at same high school so they are part of tracing, my youngest is 8th grade middle school. The health dept was pissed and said they were having to get a bunch of info because now we’ve had 30 kids from the high school pending tests for symptoms, like _PERSON_, and then the district hides my daughter being in the same house. Parents are contacting lawyers and the school threatened us through email, so there’s 75 families over 220 kids involved that we’re getting together for a big lawyer group in town, but since health dept is getting tips, we may have help. I’m on edge, and I’m done. I’m in rage mode and at th
is point I’m burning the world. Scorched earth."
176185603,Sorry you’re having a hard time _AT_MENTION_. I go through medications fast because I acclimate to them. Right now I’m on invega. Do your meds help at all?
174389827,"Maybe we are a burden on some and overall but others rely on us. Doctors, pharmacists, therapists, healthcare providers, etc… would be out of job if not for us. No??? Then again it’s mostly the govt and insurance companies paying those people cuz I sure as hell cant afford to pay for apripraZole and pdoc appointments and therapists out of pocket every month. But the world goes round and operates in a system how it is?? And we are part of that???"

176185616,So what you’re saying is you fantasize about sexually assaulting strangers on the street depending on what they are wearing. Wtf is wrong with you? That’s a huge red flag. First step towards being a rapist is fantasy.

176185633,"Definitely talk to her about this. Therapy works when there is open communication, and if something makes you uncomfortable or nervous it’s best to address it. I would guess that most therapists would prefer to have their clients tell them what makes them uneasy than to unwittingly keep doing it."
176185634,Well I had the meeting today. He decided not to retain me at this point but is giving me 3 months to improve. I just got another job offer though. $37 an hour. Aircraft mechanic but would have to move to Alabama. The wife says no. Guess I have to try to improve.

176185644,I have read the constitution of the United States. I have taken 2 constitutional law classes in college. The constitution doesn’t really say individuals have the right to bear arms. It says states have the rights to having a militia. I think since every state has a National Guard there’s your militia. Unless you are going hunting you don’t need a gun. That’s just my opinion.
176185645,"I think that the stress of leaving your husband and living on your own is making you more paranoid. Try to make contact with someone you can really talk to. Divorcing my ex wife made me go nuts. I became symptomatic with mania and depression. Call up a crisis line if you have to and make sure you remain in close contact with your doctor during this stressful period. I’m not going to lie to you, it’s going to get rocky. Divorce is a big stressor, and you have to make sure that you take extra measures to take care of yourself during this time."

I have asked some weird questions about that but I’ve always taken the pills. It’s a hard cop that first understanding. They rushed me back to work. I went psychotic in a workplace of 300 people and I was still getting positives and I’d come unstuck and didn’t know what was from what! Still. I found this website and it’s given me a hell of a lot even through the dark times. I’m glad we’ve met even on this space because your a good dude and we’d get on really good in real life!

I’ve had good quality time with my kids, despite my illness and I’ve prepared them for the inevitable. They know I will love them alive and will love them til my death. I’ve lived life pretty much my way, so I’m happy with that. I’ve been married, had sex, got to have a childhood, teenage years, I’ve traveled a bit, I’ve owned a house, cars, gotten pampered, felt love, understood empathy, etc… I’m content with how I’ve lived this far and if cancer hits, im letting nature take it’s course."

176185655,Honestly I feel like ????. You?
176185656,I feel calmer actually. I was worried about worsened akithisia but so far it’s the same. But I feel a little less anxious
176185657,"Because sometimes people say things just to trigger others. Someone made a thread celebrating their sobriety and then comes along a sporadic drinker posting links to drinking songs. Another person started a thread to talk about Captain _USER_ID_’s mustache, which _PERSON_ believes is entangled in his brain neurons. Someone else went onto a thread about someone’s paranoia and advised them not to write it off as just a symptom. This last one may have been partially influenced by my own paranoia. A new member (guy had been here for 2 days) was trying to get people to talk to him on WhatsApp. I didn’t flag it at first, but it quickly became clear that this person had no intention of participating in the public forum and just wanted to speak to people in an area in which they could not be protected. I don’t know why, and while it’s possible that their intentions were innocent, it’s also possible that they were not."
176185658,It’s a good letter because it lets him know how you’re really doing.

176185661,_AT_MENTION_ thank you
176185662,Good job. Shouldn’t take meds unless it’s necessary. AP’s are probably some of the drugs that have the most potential serious side-effects. This is in no way a call to stop taking your meds people. Just saying. I read on my AP medication amongst possible side-effect: “Sudden death”. I guess this is Big Pharmas way of getting away from lawsuits. I just want to add so I don’t scare anyone that the chances of something like that actually happening is very slim.
176185663,I think it sounds like a depressed mood. I can also relate to _AT_MENTION_ that “there are some chores that I should do but only do them when I must”.

176185667,Keep on the meds…you back on zyprexa? That is a good thing. It might take you time to get back to where you were but it’s important to stay on the meds and to keep in touch with your doctor. If not then you need to see a doctor.
176185668,Big hugs _PERSON_
176185669,Okay… that’s too much into detail… How r u doing today? Why do u love reading my posts?
176185670,Yes i have finger infection.thats why i m using it now
176185671,Thanks to you both. I guess it just made me feel good that he was trying to relate. And I understand that saying THAT could be faulty perception in me - nonetheless I’ll take it! !
176185672,"Yeah, I agree. They have an awful lot of power to dispense meds that arent even necessarily needed in a psyche ward. I’m still not happy about it as it was before my trial to determine if i would be involuntarily put on invega sustenna. And I was not a threat to anyone. She just did it because she didn’t want to argue. But like I said, what ya gonna do."
176185673,Reducing SSRI usage is the best solution if apathy is due to it. Also it can come from low thyroid function so checking to make sure its in optimal range is beneficial.

176185676,You could check out the ‘most haunted’ you tube videos. MH Extra Gloucester Prison Might seem the absolute worst thing to do but these shows are so ridiculous that it makes the issue of real ghosts seem farcical.
176185677,I think I’ve found another qualified therapist? She’s an older lady who is a psychologist. She has a lot of experience and also treats paranoid clients. I found out tonight that she holds liberal views so this might be a better fit for me. My current therapist is a die hard conservative and I just don’t relate. I’m going to give her a call probably either tonight or tomorrow.

176185710,I’m pretty treatment resistant and med resistant so it don’t matter any way. Meds don’t work on me. My negatives are returning and through the roof again. Delusions are still there but I don’t consider them fictional or part of the mental illness. More of an exploratory form of trying to figure out what went wrong with me. I hear things like “burn out syndrome” and stuff. I don’t know if theyre dreams or 6th sense from past lives or not. I wonder if I got a 6th sense thing going on with me. Truth is I’m at the point where I’m just living to make it another year. Meds do that. They keep me in check and staying alive right now. Nothing more. I’m sort of depressed right now bringing up memories and then the nightmares associated with such posts and memories on a public forum for anyone to see. The ramifications and so on. I was normal at one time or so I thought. I always suspected my step father messing with my phone or my computer since high school but you never know. It’s alway

174389870,"I am not very familiar with the notion of ego-death from meditative practices, but a friend of mine is into that and tells me it is a detachment from your thoughts, emotions and so on to the extent that you just witness them instead of identifying with them. Now I think this can be taken two ways: one as a metacognitive stance towards such occurrences, the other as a pre-reflective primary mode of experience. And I think the meditative practices claim the latter. I did experience something quite similar to that in the context of schizophrenia, namely an episode of some hours where I would only experience intrusive thoughts and feelings. Most times I experience intrusive thoughts as occasional occurrences intermingled with ordinary thought. This particular episode I did not have a poverty of thought, but all thought and emotion was intrusive. I witnessed thought without identifying with it and in this sense it fits the description of ego-death that my friend offered quite nicely. To me it was terrif

My practical skills are very poor, although they have improved after I started working in a shop that sold furniture. When I was heavily medicated I needed help to put up the curtain rails in the windows of the new place I lived. That is kind of embarrasing under normal circumstances.

176185844,"I’ve had a poem published so far, but I’m currently working on my first novel. It’s a biography that delves into my visions and their meanings. I’m learning a lot about myself through my writing. The things I’ve seen in psychosis are often associated with memories that have been regressed. If the voices in your head won’t stop bickering maybe you should try writing down what they say. I find that once I allow the voices an outlet they don’t talk as much, I guess they just run out of things to say. Secondly, environment plays a key role in my success at writing. The amount of lighting, the time of day, how well I’ve eaten, background noise levels can greatly impact my performance. Typically, I prefer to write in the evening with lamp light. It keeps me more mellow, and removes some of my anxiety. Everyone is different that way, I would suggest to monitor what conditions are favorable and you’ll find your comfort zone soon."

The only downsides are that I have to get the injection every two weeks, which is pretty short, and that I sleep more than twelve hours since it sedates me so much, especially in the first few days after getting the injection.

176186024,Thank you I think It’s a lot prettier in person
174389939,I use Rexulti and Saphris together. I didn’t like the Seroquel because I gained too much weight too quickly and craved sugar really badly when I took it. But I really like the Saphris because it puts me to sleep. I take it and about 20 minutes later I get drowsy and fall asleep. I personally like Rexulti for it’s antidepressant properties as well as its antipsychotic properties. When I don’t take Rexulti I have suicidal ideation. I like to take Rexulti in the morning for a little daily pick me up. Together Rexulti and Saphris work well for me.
174389940,"Personally I think this is BS. Why should we take the word of ONE person. Of course psychosis exists on a spectrum, as does schizophrenia. That’s why there USED to be types of schizophrenia. Just like autism and every other psychological disorder. HIV used to be a terminal diagnosis too. But with medication it can be managed quiet well. Same with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is no longer hopeless. We can live successful and productive lifes on medication. I understand there is _USER_ID_ behind the name. But if we just change the name to something else, the new name will just gain _USER_ID_ too. There will always be stupid people who stigmatize schizophrenia and other diseases (even physical diseases like AIDS). The word “retard” is like this too. It means the same as mentally challenged, but “sounds better”. Big deal. Getting all politically correct and changing what we call something just because of a few idiots won’t change the fact we have a serious mental disability. We don’t need 
to get rid of the label. We need to get rid of idiots."

176186041,"I’m going to say that it can be hard to help someone through a break up. It depends entirely on that persons unique situation but one thing is universal…just be there to listen. Listen to them talk, sometimes endlessly, about the situation and their ex. They need to vent. Its very all consuming when you lose someone in a sudden break up and they are probably spending 24/7 thinking about it. So just listen to start. They may or may not want your advice. Try to remember, it’s ok to give your honest well thought out and well worded opinion but telling them what to do or how to live their life is usually fruitless. Just be there when they say they don’t want to talk to/ see/ sleep with the ex anymore and they go back and do those things they don’t want to do 100 times. Just be there and remember to listen."

176186053,"I think becoming sz is a sign you dropped a bad personal habit maybe without knowing it. Thus the always feeling incomplete. Our job is to fill the void with something good which can be very difficult to do as we had grown to believe we were good enough before our picking up sz. I think usually the bad habit was something in the family. With me the bad habit was ignoring the needs of children and being not only ignorant about them but not particularly interested in learning. So, while I was hospitalized for the first time, I decided I didn’t want to become a mother. It just wasn’t for me."

176186056,Did Straterra really help you? I took a similar drug named Wellbutrin which also increases dopamine and norepinephrine but it only made me worse like suicidal ideation and suicidal fanstasies so I stopped it after a month. Also it didn’t help at all for negative symptoms.

It should make my negative symptoms slightly better but I hope it won’t make me impulsive or give me addiction problems like Abilify 20mg. Given that its only 1mg and that Rexulti has slightly less side effects than Abilify, I think it should be good and shouldn’t change my personality like Abilify 20mg. Once Vraylar is out here by end of this year, I should be on Vraylar only and my negative symptoms should improve even much more."

What is your goal weight, or do you not know yet? I previously thought 175 but I think 160 will be better. 175 is still significantly overweight for a woman who is only 5’5"" so I lowered it. I’ll have to be patient to lose that last 15, but I think it will be worth it.

I have to change my mindset. Maybe I have to work. I don’t know. Maybe the day treatment group I’m in is too low functioning and I’m not learning as much as I could."
176186078,"maybe it just really is a illness and our brains are some how damaged and it makes people hear voices. Ever notice no one ever has schiz and the voices are nice and tell you how good you, everyone who gets it is negative voices. Maybe its all just ???????? and they really dont exist at all…i think about it sometimes"
176186079,"Time and perception are immediate and mixed with the mind’s ability to prepare for the future through guesswork as we try to make sense of the world. For example, do you ever guess what someone is going to say before they say it in conversation? I mean do you ever try to finish people’s sentences for them either out loud or in your brain? It is a normal part of interaction in day to day life as we try to understand each other to our best ability. Well, if you do then watching tv is like your mind trying to have a conversation with the item by finishing the sentences for them. Of course, the tv doesn’t actually talk or respond to you in reality, but in a mild state of psychosis the interaction can be muddling and confusing to you. Your mind is racing to get to the end of what is being said on the TV. It is guessing that is all,; and for example, as our minds work pretty similarly psychologically speaking in that once you have seen an advert it is embedded in our subconsciousness you know what 
is going to happen next in the advert from that moment on, then once you have seen the news it embeds the common occurrences that you expect to happen and fills in the gaps. You think you are blowing your mind by your mind filling in the gaps, but you can now understand why perhaps."

There also doesn’t seem to be any further interest from anyone else to buy it, at the moment. However, the good thing that is happening despite it is, I don’t think I’ve ever felt more connected to people recently in the 2 1/2 years since I started work. I feel it not just from my coworkers, but also the staff and clients at the recovery centre. Most of all, I’d have to say family, especially bonding over music with _NAME_ as we share songs through text on Apple Music. Because I received a good cut from the estate sale a few weekends ago, I’m also doing well financially. I’m in a really good place right now. One thing that’s still up in the air is whether I’m done grieving or not, because it’s only been 3 months now.

On top of that I was much better than them before my sz and I was the one laughing at them and seeing them as stupid. They were kissing my ass before my sz.

174389966,I have learned by trial and error that schizophrenics don?t always have an idea about what they are doing. I lose my memory when psychotic. I don?t realize what I am doing. An unmedicated schizophrenic can be dangerous. And it took me years to be be med compliant. If it weren?t an issue there would be no need to mention it. It?s rare. But these things do happen.

176186096,My son said he would do it with me. But he lives far away. Maybe he would move back here. He is here right now and out of work due to the virus. He is a bartender. And I guess I always could hire someone to help me out. Right now I work from home though so I can keep an eye on my own dogs. When I went to work every day my wife made me bring them to camp. She doesn’t like watching them.
176186097,"Well back in 2002, I was in grade 11 and I started going to raves. I was doing a lot of illusions back then but not really dancing. This really famous popper came to town in 2003 and I finally got to see what popping was. Bear in mind that there was no Youtube back then. Popping was so fresh and mysterious to me back then, had a real mystique about it. I met someone local on an online forum and he taught me how to actually dance to the music. He would eventually become the leader of our crew, we learned by travelling around taking workshops and ordering VHS tapes. The great thing about this kind of dance is that it’s self directed. Once you learn the basics you can basically just teach yourself how to improve instead of shelling out money for classes all the time."

176186106,Depression is my serious bugbear. My first break was depression and even after psychosis it’s the depths of depression that really bite… Found a good med. It works well after a lot of trial and effort but gawd. That feeling that it’s there in the background annoys me all the time. I get in a flat spot with my body and I feel it’s creepy claws… When I was a teenager my mind made me a control freak. My worst fear was losing my mind…Ironic that years later I did but getting on meds really did help me recover.
176186107,I completed the previous iterations of what’s currently called Posit Science BrainHQ.com. I did both about 10 years ago and the research into this was in its infancy at the time. At that time they were called The Posit Science Brain Fitness Program (auditory training) and Posit Science Cortex With Insight (visual training). I responded well to them and I found them entertaining and effective. The change was gradual but I decided to give them a try because I had begun to forget whether I had taken my meds or not. That was 10 years ago and my memory since then hasn’t failed. Now everyone in my family remarks on how good my memory is. I think the training gives the brain a foundation on which to build and when the foundation is there then the brain uses the foundation to rebuild itself through everyday experiences from then on.

It’s just boring maybe I’m not good at it. I can make myself orgasm but the orgasm is not intense and I rather not. I am not sexually active. I have herpes and hpv so I have to tell my future partner about that and see if they are still interested plus I have to tell them about schizophrenia. I’m doing fine without sex and without masturbating. I can still get turned on. Last time was a few months ago though. I want to have extatic intimate sex. A sacred happy union.

Not for the feint of heart, I had a recently tried healing an old, bad psychological wound and it was hell on earth for a day."

As you can appreciate, a highly dismissive and semantically troubled statement (who is trying to “pass it off as something meaningful”, and wouldn’t such an intentionality impinge on its “psychotic” quality?) made from a place of moral certainty. I’m not bitter though, I rather like this place but it’s to be expected that we bring more than a little bit of ourselves to the proceedings."

176186150,So do you still believe your life is in danger? You are still here Glad to hear from you again.
176186151,"_AT_MENTION_ Excellent question. The answer, I’m afraid, is a very prosaic: I’m not a real gnostic or at least not a very orthodox one; gnosticism is what comes closest to what I believe to be true, and I use its disperse theology to make myself understood. Gnosticism is but an allegory within an allegory. Back to Irenaeus, his conceptual framework and mythological imagery are simply incompatible with those of the gnostics he attacks. The first monad is not identical in any way to the traditional god, and the demiurge is not free at all, quite the opposite. Originally he intended to make a perfect mirror image of the pleroma but failed dismally in the task. To be honest, the objections that Plotinus makes to the gnostics are far more substantial. _AT_MENTION_ “The so called “Gospel of _NAME_” is essentially a Gnostic text and interpretation of “Source gospel” or Z document, to which the closest Gospel to that is that called “Mark”.” I suppose you mean the Q document. Anyway, whe
n it comes to _NAME_’s gospel I take my cues from _NAME_ study of its relationship with St. _NAME_ gospel. There are _USER_ID_ quasi-gnostic elements in the _NAME_’s gospel but to be honest I wouldn’t characterise it as being truly gnostic, but the jury is still out there. _AT_MENTION_ I know, religion and stuff, but I’ve made a significant spiritual breakthrough and I wanted to share it with you guys."

176186183,"There are other mood stabilizers, such as Lamictal, Tegretol and Depakote. I currently take Lamictal, though I did take lithium for quite a while. I’ve also been tried on Depakote and Tegretol. What sort of side effects are you having? When I was on lithium I had increased urination and thirst, as well as fine motor tremors. Lithium is eliminated by the kidneys, so there is no way around the increased urination/thirst, just have to drink more water and stay hydrated. As far as the tremors go, propranolol worked well for me for calming those. I’ve never heard of Ebselen."

176186193,I did the 5:2 diet fasting for a few months. After a few weeks of it the fasting days feel no different to eating days and there’s no additional hunger at all. Eat ordinarily on 5 days of the week and then 700 calories on the remaining two days. I found it better to just prepare the fasting days food beforehand so that there’s little mental discipline expended on those days. That way it just becomes a mechanical exercise rather than a battle of willpower.

176186213,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Combination of olanzapine and samidorphan has no clinically relevant effects on ECG parameters, including the QTc interval: Results from a phase 1 QT/QTc study. _PERSON_ Sun, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Brown, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry, Jan 28 2020 OLZ/_NAME_ is a combination of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and samidorphan, an opioid antagonist, and is in development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. OLZ/_NAME_ is under development with the intent to provide the established antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine while mitigating olanzapine-associated weight gain. This thorough QT study assessed the effects of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of OLZ/_NAME_ on cardiac repolarization in patients with schizophrenia.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive (moxifloxacin)-controlled, parallel-group study, 100 patients aged 18 to 60?years with stable 
schizophrenia were randomized 3:2 to the active arm and control arm. Subjects in the active arm received a therapeutic dose of 10/10?mg (10?mg olanzapine/10?mg samidorphan) on days 2-4, 20/20?mg on days 5-8, and a supratherapeutic dose of 30/30?mg (1.5 times and 3 times the maximum recommended daily dose of olanzapine and samidorphan, respectively) on days 9-13, and moxifloxacin-matched placebo on days 1 and 14. Subjects in the control arm received a single oral dose of moxifloxacin 400?mg and moxifloxacin-matched placebo on days 1 and 14 in a nested crossover fashion, along with OLZ/_NAME_-matched placebo on days 2-13. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) and simultaneous plasma drug concentrations were determined pre- and post-dose. The effects of OLZ/_NAME_ on heart rate and ECG parameters (QT interval with _PERSON_ correction [QTcF], PR and QRS interval, and T-wave morphology) were evaluated, and the primary endpoint was change from baseline in QTcF (?QTcF). The relationship between drug concentration and ?QT
cF (C-QTc) was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model. Safety monitoring included adverse events reporting and clinical laboratory assessments.Based on primary analysis using C-QTc modeling, no clinically concerning QTc effect (ie, placebo-corrected ?QTcF [??QTcF] ?10?msec) was observed across the OLZ/_NAME_ dose range tested (10/10 to 30/30?mg), up to olanzapine and samidorphan concentrations of approximately 110 and 160?ng/mL, respectively. The slope (90% confidence interval [CI]) of the C-QTc relationship was shallow and not significant for either olanzapine or samidorphan (0.03 [-0.01, 0.08] and 0.01 [-0.01, 0.04] msec per ng/mL, respectively). The predicted ??QTcF (90% CI) was 2.33 (-2.72, 7.38) and 1.38 (-3.37, 6.12) msec at the observed geometric mean maximal concentration (Cmax) of olanzapine (62.6?ng/mL) and samidorphan (75.1?ng/mL) on day 13, respectively. The study's assay sensitivity was confirmed by the C-QTc relationship of moxifloxacin. OLZ/_NAME_ was well tolerated at all doses; adverse 
events occurring in >5% of subjects treated with OLZ/_NAME_ were somnolence, weight increased, nausea, and dizziness.This thorough QT study in patients with stable schizophrenia demonstrated that OLZ/_NAME_, in doses and plasma concentrations up to supratherapeutic levels, does not have a clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters, including QT/QTc prolongation."

176186279,"Yeah the pandemic is not good and all the stuff happening. That’s understandable that its stressing you out. One good thing is that Abilify really helped me manage stress when I was in moments like that. So you could consider it temporary relief, although it has been so effective it’s the only psyche med I would take. People have different chemistries, some people find meds like Geodon help them where-as it made my symptoms worse. I recently went off Aristada but it may have been working better than I realized. I just didn’t like being on an injection. The plus side of being on Aristada was that it kept me clean for 6 months, and when I took myself off it I relapsed/got sick again. Now I’m taking 10mgs of Abilify and its effective. I think you risk the meds not working if you suddenly stop taking them, or mess with the doses, especially injections. I got really sick when I abruptly threw away my Aristada. I didn’t sleep for five days. I went to the ER twice and the second time they gave m
e Risperdal to help bring me down, and then I went back on the Abilify. So if the vision blurriness gets worse there are always other medications, and you should probably reduce it with pills if you’re coming off the injection or maybe just stay on the Abilify and see if the side effects go away, could be allergies. Could be hormones, the weather. Aging. Stress. My vision wasn’t instantly blurrier. I started taking this when I was 16 and I’m 32. I only needed glasses a few years ago and I still don’t wear them. Other medications also affected my vision though, stimulants like Vyvanse altered my vision. Anti-depressants and ephedrine altered my vision. I wonder what’s wrong with me, if its possibly reversible like dry-eyes or hormone or vitamin deficiency. Just started taking something called “Eye vision Guard” which is Lutein Bilberry its a vitamin supplement for the eyes. I haven’t noticed anything yet but I hope I find something that could reverse the eye damage/sensitivity."

I had to take two Abilify pills to level out. I’m never taking it again. My addiction counselor thinks I should take it because it helps control my impulses and is supposed to help with depression. But I don’t have depression and I’m a crying mess. The crisis worker said not to take Prozac until I talk to the psychiatrist. So I have to wait 1-2 days for him to call me. So I have no idea if I should take Prozac or not take it. The Crisis person said don’t take it, the addiction counselor advised to do what works best and that withdrawal is dangerous. That this is when it’s supposed to start working. I’m very confused, very conflicted and overwhelmed. I typed that so freaking fast I am definitely that manic. I’m manic-more-than-normal. Just fired my betterhelp therapist for not replying to me yesterday 
after she asked how I was doing and I told her the truth. Not good it would be nice if I were able to curse rainbows and unicorns. I feel evil and angry. I’m never angry. I see anger in my words and I’m not even angry. I’m crying but I’m enjoying it. What next, I’ll be laughing maniacally and not enjoying it. That never will happen. Or will it. Everyone hates me. I’m an embarrassment. Poetry is dead. America is dead. The world blows. Blow me civilization. I love you, peace"
176186300,I’ve been taking anti psychotics for almost thirty years.

176186302,thank you _AT_MENTION_
176186303,You are on a webboard where people really do need these meds and there’s good reasons why you should be too. It’s early in your progress so please be patient. We have discussed this several times already as a community…you are on the meds for a reason.
176186304,I hope so too. 15
176186305,"I’m sorry I misunderstood you, I’ll be praying you get an antibiotic that worke"
176186306,_AT_MENTION_ Remember never to compare / compete with yourself to anyone. You’re beautiful. I hope you can really see that.
176186307,"Yeah, I wouldn’t recommend any SZ person go fully off meds. It’s tempting, but you need at least a minimum amount of AP as a buffer from relapsing."
176186308,I take Belsomra for sleep but it makes me feel horrible in the morning
176186309,"Wow. That’s crazy. See, they do figure it all out. They follow us around and record us. I just want my privacy"
176186310,I’ve been surprised in the past at how nice or mean people have been to me or others. What time do you have to get up for work? Just curious if you’re up shopping at 1:30 AM.
176186311,"There are other ways to be spiritual and believe in science. Try to find your way. But hearing voices has a clear psychotic connotation if you believe in the second. Science says that you should take care of them aswell, if you want to continue living with a working brain in the future."
176186312,They wouldn’t tell me but when I went into hospital they wrote clouded consciousness
176186313,I was delusional for over 15 years.

176186315,Thanks _PERSON_.
176186316,"When I was a teen, right out of the blue, my father said to me “You don’t appreciate life.” I didn’t respond at all. I never responded to my parents when they spoke to me. They seldom spoke to me. I think they gave up on me."
176186317,"That’s brave.Being single and happy is not easy,you need to make happiness for yourself"
176186318,I’ve lost count. I’ve lived in 3 different countries and moved around while living in them.
176186319,"She didn’t tell me those when we dated. She told me all these much later when we went to her parents where her aunt lives too. I was traumatized there, she even told me that I looked traumatized. I felt that I didn’t belong there. I guess I escaped. My sz made me weak emotionally too, I didn’t know how to escape from her without injuring her emotions. I am happy now that I was able to escape from her. My family told me that she was manipulating me as I had money and was studying physiotherapy in university. They told me that I deserve much better than her."
174390021,"yea i take the risperdal and clozapine combo and i can say it’s working very well for me. I don’t know about abilify though, never used that."
176186320,So does the sz make them less psychopaths bcz it disables them?
176186321,Please ban this troll
176186322,Coincidences can screw us up.
176186323,Try to get a job being an assistant manager in Walmart. That will keep you in shape. I wish I would have been better when I had that job. I couldn’t keep it. Was too sick then and I quit with no notice so they won’t take me back. You unload trucks and walk that store all day long. The pay is pretty decent for retail but it’s a lot of work and long days. Sometimes more than a 12 hour shift. It was too much for me when I wasn’t stable but I was skinny as hell.
176186324,Always. Call pdoc call caseworker call hospital. I’ve learnt now I’m getting my ass kicked. You’ll be a lot worse being off of your meds.
176186325,"Here is my stolen life; First, they took my childhood away from me, And they told me that I don’t need it. They took away my ability to express and mutter words, They took away my dolls, my chopsticks, and my ability to fail, My ability to express, and my ability to have emotions were taken away. And they said I don’t need them. Here is my stolen life; Second, they took my sanity away from me, And they told me that I don’t need it- and no one would ever want me. They put me all kinds of labels that no one wants, Strap me down, screaming vicious words over my head, And told me that it was my fault. And they said I don’t need happiness. Here is my stolen life; Thirdly, they took my health away fro me, And they told me that I don’t need it- and no one would love me. They strapped me down to a medical chair, whispered lies and took my money, And told me that: “You had depression and you’re just mentally ill.” They spun me around and around, doctors from doctors, Until a doctor pondered 
upon sufferings kindly. And they told me it was my fault, and I was born this way. And they said I don’t deserve a normal life. Here is my stolen life; They told I don’t need anything, but sorrow and sadness, Desolation and deprivation, Wailing in the dark, waiting for someone to cut my throat And declare me unlovable. Here is my stolen life, and they said that I don’t need a life."
176186326,Glad to hear you’re okay _AT_MENTION_
176186327,My libido is much higher off meds. I’m glad I’ve chilled out some in that regard.

174390020,"I agree, but seeing you also echo “his criticism of solipsism as a philosophical position”, how do you propose the prevalence of solipsistic themes in schizophrenic thinking should be conceptualised (beyond, this is, psychological solipsism)?"
176186330,"Compared to the little lives of my silly old classmates, I live a glorious life."
176186331,"Would the topic of Gaslighting and expressing your personnel experiences of what it was like to live through, be a bannable material upon a mental health platform."
176186332,"I agree. It’s crazy to take antipsychotics for so long with all the health effects. And to be honest, I’m not even fully sure if reducing dopamine in the brain really does lead to less symptoms, or preventing psychosis. Plenty of people are cuckoo whilst still on the meds, and I was crazy in hospital for 11 weeks whilst medicated. I think it was me who snapped out of psychosis and delusion, not the meds that did it."
176186333,I used to drink a lot to cope too. Wishing you some relief _NAME_!
174390022,"A few years ago, they thought I had Gullian-Barre syndrome, a disorder that can be caused by EB virus. They do blood tests for that, which came back negative.

176186339,I feel like he has corrupted me by possibly turning me into a terrorist. Like I think I was a terrorist before. Not sure. I had visions. But if these are telepathic visions/voices then they can’t be real right? Not sure if visions were telepathic but they were sent from some government agency. Is that real?
176186340,surely needs a quick bump…
176186341,_AT_MENTION_ Parenting is a job that has to be done without training or help. At times things do get out of hand but it is never deliberate. Give your mother the space she requires and cool down a tad bit before acting. Parents are the only folks that care about me when not even my own son talks to me.
176186342,"I’m not sure about some of the things you’ve said, but I know I have been asked a question or two by professionals that seem prying, inappropriate, and not related to my health at all. Maybe those are for studies or something but I was tempted to say something rude back. To be clear, I’m talking about the professionals."
176186343,"Of course not. There are 7 billion people in the world, could they all really be in on a global conspiracy designed to humiliate me? I’m on risperidone so i have some insight so i can say no, but I still don’t truly believe there is no plot. I want to make friends but i think everyone is against me so I don’t trust anyone. I have one Facebook friend who I regularly talk to and she has never done anything wrong but I still don’t trust her but i am forcing myself to, otherwise i will have no one. Are you aware of any plot against me? Has anyone been in contact with you about me? Do you even know who i am? I can’t help thinking that everyone online knows who i am even though i make anonymous accounts."

176186348,Oh I see! I guess the care is different than in Calgary. I’m sorry that you had a horrible experience there. I was in multiple wards but hospital stays are horrible because they’re terrifying due to psychosis.
176186349,Sound advice _AT_MENTION_ . I could never find another job with all the perks and benefits of this one.
176186350,"When I was younger I could go without sleep for days and not feel tired, but I think that’s when my illness started also. Sleep deprivation seems to trigger psychosis in me now. Is that normal? Is that normal for normal people? I feel awful for delusional things I’ve thought or said after an episode. I don’t know if this is psychosis or mania, or what the difference is…I just know that if I miss one night of sleep I’m a mess. Where-as in the past I could go days and nights without sleep and not crash."

176186359,I know my ????. Conviction plays no role in intrusive thoughts.

176186362,Why? Give me an example
174390030,Abilify improved my negatives by 40% but I stopped it due to side effects. I ordered Sarcosine and will soon try Asenapine or Quetiapine. I read they’re good for negatives. Did you try Abilify?

So it’s actually one diagnosis, not three. If someone gave you three, you might get a second opinion (sorry I’m a mental health student)."
176186366,Hang in there _PERSON_. Blasting music helps me as well. Hopefully your friend will come through. The docs might pick up on other things than suicidal thoughts. Psychosis can be sneaky. But doing a stay may be the best thing for you at this time.
174390034,I’m sorry that about three years ago I misspelled schizophrenia. I put an “R” on the end of it and claimed it was an accident but I really did it on purpose. I was just feeling spiteful at the time and I’ve been carrying the shame of it every day and I just had to get it off my chest. It was eating me up inside.
176186367,Symptoms have been really bad today. I’ve been down all day. Haven’t been able to get out of bed. I just realized I haven’t showered in 4 days. And I still can’t manage to get up and shower. I’m just in a very dark place and can’t get out.

176186370,I will pray for that for you too. Wishing you well.
176186371,Do you ever feel messed up? I feel like theres something really wrong with me even with symptoms under control. And I feel like a bother as my mental health team don’t even pick up my calls… I feel my partner could do better and he shuoldn’t be with someone like me because I am “broken”… He seems to think that having a physical health problem is no different to having a mental health issue and shouldn’t be treated different… But I feel if I stay with him his family isn’t going to be happy

I have my first ever meeting with a psychiatrist on the 27th, I hope he/she changes my meds. I feel trapped in my own mind/body but can’t do much without feeling anxious and having a racing heart"

176186384,I don’t watch tv shows. I just have music tv channels on as something in the background. I wouldn’t say it disturbs me but I just don’t like tv shows in general.

174390051,Why would these kids do that?
176186386,"Hi, what’s your background? Are you on medication? Do you see the pdoc regularly? Last time I thought like that, I was unmedicated and very unhappy."
176186387,Looks delicious!
174390041,"Exactly, you have negative symptoms without meds. Some ppl here think its the meds but reality is that its the schizophrenia. Did you try Abilify? It improved my negative symptoms by ~40%. Just watchout for addiction issues and hypersexuality."
176186388,Congratulation I am happy for you and for all who fight in work world Be happy for yourself and be proud
176186389,Who all knows about your diagnosis? I’d say everyone in my life knows pretty much. My parents (obviously) and all my friends- except one and I can’t decide if I should even tell her. In fear she will reject me. I also at some point had my username on Instagram with skitzo in it. And who knows how many people in my town know… word travels fast in small towns
176186390,I used to be messy but now fairly tidy.
176186391,I’m just going to try and keep it to fridays… I’m really not to happy that I’ve slipped into it this far
176186392,"I think it started around 10:00 this morning so when I went back to my apartment after lunch I googled “grief on _NAME_’s day”. Sure enough, there were several articles that came up. I don’t remember this happening after Dad died. But, I can only imagine what it’s like for my brother’s mother-in-law, because her dead husband’s funeral was today."
176186393,Haha! Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! Thank you _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ ! And thank you for your suggestions! Thank you _AT_MENTION_ ! I appreciate it!
174390048,"I was never formally diagnosed, but if you read my messages on this forum its pretty obvious that I am some sort of a crazy person. It took me six crushing years before I started to take any decisive action. I partially blame my mother who still refuses to admit that its just cursed schizophrenia, instead of getting me to a doctor the day I started mad rants. I try to find medication but its all very slow and tedious. I should probably just bust into a Ward and demand attention."
176186394,Lol yea! How was yours? Did you enjoy it or did u feel harassed
176186395,I always told that friend that he stresses too much for no reason.
176186396,Yes I am. I couldn’t log into that account so I made a new one. Sorry hope that’s okay
176186397,"Tell your psychiatrist, illogical thoughts and obsessions are from psychosis."
176186398,I would rather get a male vibrator.
176186399,I don’t want to but I got to. It happens to me every day.
176186400,no i have anxiety and don’t watch a lot of tv. i do watch late night shows on you tube. i’m a you tube addict. It’s okay i understand on sharing the city.
176186401,Absolutely. I think you should go for it.
176186402,I wouldn’t stay on the pills to be honest…:
176186403,the brain is like a receiver really. You pick up on channels outside of the brain and the brain translates it and stores whatever you want stored.
174390043,"If it were me, I would switch to pill and come off a very tiny amount to test the severity of withdrawl. You don’t want to mess up school."
176186404,When you say they target you who are they?
176186405,Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_!
174390057,"I am like you, I rely on my parents for everything, they get my meds, my food, clean my room, house me, etc I know that no one can help us bcz we can’t even help ourselves. In my case the cayse is severe negative symptoms, I stay in bed all day everyday, only get up to eat. In bed I either sleep or on this forum."
176186406,"I can look at a naked man or woman - and have no response at all. I think its just because ive got older. And ive been impotent for years, from the meds - but sex and getting a stiffy, really isnt high on my list of priorities anymore. Maybe that would change, if i fell in love again (doubtful). But ive resigned myself to the fact im probably gonna be a bacholor now. Im not a very good partner now anyway, ive got selfish living on my own after all these years. Ive had my children and done the marriage thing."
176186407,"I’m happy and content because I have to be. I won’t allow myself anything else. I no longer have any requirements for happiness other than not being locked in a cell 24/7 with crappy food, a toilet, and an uncomfortable bedroll."
174390049,Let’s see how this works Fingers crossed!
176186408,Yeah cool…
176186409,That’s too bad. Maybe soon.
176186410,"Last one! In the past, to be safe from temperamental people I’d be quiet and look at nobody, all to avoid making someone angry. Looking back it probably seemed cold. My English teacher described me as wooden."
176186411,"I wonder what will happen with mine, I will be truthful My mum always says to base it off my worst days so they have the full picture. My bad days are once in a blue moon now (hopefully I don’t jinx that)"
176186412,"If you’re part of the plot, you would assure me that it’s a delusion, but the truth is that everyone is an actor"
176186413,Thanks. The picture I’m working on now is about halfway done. Maybe I’ll post a pic of it when its done
176186414,I’m dealing with this now to the point where everyone thinks I’ve lost my mind. It started with a rock i found… and i became obsessed… now I see faces that I don’t want to. I want it to go away
176186415,That’s how I had to do it. I bought so many packs of cigs to smoke 1 and throw out the other 19. I did this probably 15-20 times over 3 years. Eventually things will work out for you as it did for me and you’ll end up nicotine free. GL
176186416,"I’ve been homeless. A fellow homeless person I used to talk to a lot used to feel conflicted and guilty when people gave him money. He would be thankful, but it didn’t always show. Sometimes people would get mean because he wasn’t thankful enough. But the reason he was conflicted is because he was a recovering addict and had a really hard time spending the money on food or clean clothes instead of drugs. He always tried really hard to stay clean, but cash was a trigger for him. Not saying all 3 of those people were the same, just that there may be more to it. Maybe they’re overcome with guilt and they wear their emotions on their faces. Maybe they’re just having a bad day. Maybe they’re just really ??????? cold and a little cash doesn’t really help with that in the moment. It could be anything. But, ultimately, look at yourself. What were you wanting to feel? Why? Why do you need their validation to feel good? You did a good thing."

I was also affected by this horror, except I realised it’s “true nature”. I know I pile it on. This is just how I felt and still feel partially. I could elaborate. I still often see other people as just tiny sparkling lights in darkness. Some as small as broken glass in a dumpster, some as candle lights, very few as torches.

176186455,"When I first got sick in 1980 when I was 19 I got put in a group home. It was in downtown San _NAME_, a city of about 600,000 people. The rules were pretty lax there in the home. During the day I could come and go as I please. I went out at night but that’s when the gangs came out and the hookers, homeless people and other unsavory characters took over the streets. I used to have this used bookstore about 7 blocks away that I went to during the day. I would go there and spend an hour or two at a time browsing the books and reading them, occasionally buying a couple. I would take walks downtown all the time just for something to do. I couldn’t work at that point and I didn’t even really have to clean at the house, I just had my little room which I kept neat and clean but the counselors did most of the tidying up. I had nowhere I had to be, I just had whole days to kill time and do what I want. I went into restaurants occasionally, but rarely. The University was about 5 blocks away, I went ther
e too and hung out in the student union, watching TV or playing pinball. I did this for a year. I wasn’t really afraid to walk the crowded streets during the day. No one bothered me or gave me a second look. That was my life. Every now and then I hung out with some people my age at the house. One guy had a car and we went places. I look back at what I did then and I sure wouldn’t do it now. They rebuilt downtown and put in new clubs and trendy restaurants. But that neighborhood was worse back then. Before they cleaned it up in the late eighties it had a bunch of sex shops and adult shops and two X-rated adult theaters. It had hookers and seedy bars. It’s probably my age but I would be a lot more careful if I went there now. That was a long time ago. The hookers and sex shops have been replaced with Starbucks and drunken college students. IDK, I just grew up in a nice, peaceful town and being in San _NAME_ in the eighties was an eye opener sometimes."

You cant say you believe in something you know is not real. I think it would be hard to give an example of where that is not true. As for a grey area there is lots of things we are unsure about, but you are either saying you believe in it, or it is just the same as every other person where it is a possibility until you learn about it like a lot of things."

176186488,I take some meds at night and some in mornings. Is it something to do with dosage?

174390063,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and eating disorders in Sweden and Denmark. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and SE _PERSON_, Molecular psychiatry, May 2020 07 Eating disorders and schizophrenia are both moderately to highly heritable and share significant genetic risk despite distinct diagnostic criteria. Large-scale family studies on the co-aggregation of these disorders are lacking. Thus, we aimed to estimate the co-occurrence and familial co-aggregation of these disorders within the entire Swedish and Danish population. The proband cohort consisted of individuals born in Sweden (1977-2003) and Denmark (1984-2006) and still residing in their respective country at age six (NSweden?=?2,535,191, NDenmark?=?1,382,367). Probands were linked to their biological parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles/aunts, and cousins. Diagnoses for anorexia nervosa (AN) and other eating disorders (OED: bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disor
der, and eating disorder not otherwise specified) for probands and schizophrenia diagnoses for both probands and relatives were obtained. The likelihood of having schizophrenia in those with AN or OED and their relatives was compared with individuals without eating disorder diagnoses and their relatives. Probands with AN or OED were more likely to have schizophrenia than probands without these disorders. All relatives of probands with AN or OED (except parents and uncles/aunts of probands with AN) were at increased risk of schizophrenia. In general, the magnitude of odds ratios attenuated with decreasing genetic relatedness. These results suggest familial liability contributes to the association between eating disorders and schizophrenia. Clinicians should be mindful of this comorbid and co-aggregation pattern as it may influence case conceptualization and treatment decisions."

Waiting to see a new pdoc and will tell him/her I don’t know if my sza is getting worse or what. When I first got it, it was a very gradual decline with one symptom coming up at a time, then I got gradually better after a few years After my relapse five years later, it got gradually worse. It started with depression then moods and then paranoia came, then only about two years later the voices started getting worse. As years passed and my awareness of my sza grew, I noticed my symptoms more. But it seems like it got worse After my relapse Alien the evil spirit revealed himself in 2015 and _NAME_ the good spirit in 2018 - although I felt her presence in 2015 already. And now I noticed A

He’d want to try kill people or animals using me. This hasn’t happened much before but if I reduced my meds too much it’d happen and caused a lot of distress I don’t know if I’m getting worse or if it’s just because I’m aware more of my sza after learning a lot. Now that I’m getting a divorce the stress is making it worse and I’m hearing voices a little more than usual. And inserted thoughts and paranoia worse too The only thing still under control is the severe depression. The lamotrigine is helping with it still. But psychosis a little worse. Is it worsening over time? Or is it just stress? Or a greater awareness? I dunno…"

176186537,I’m asking because I’m laughing a lot now. Lots of things amuse me
176186538,I’m struggling to accept that my illness changed my life. I had hopes of going to graduate school and becoming a professor. But now I can barely focus long enough to read for 5 minutes. I struggled hard in undergrad since j was going through prodormal phase and now j just know I cant handle it anymore.
176186539,"Yes, let’s begin, _AT_MENTION_ . I already had two cookies today. I’m not going to have any more today. And I won’t have any more than two a day from now on. (I usually have four to five a day). Also, I will, starting today, walk up and down four flights of stairs three times every day. This, in addition to my daily yoga. What will you do?"
176186540,Hmm. I Was Probably In Some Spiritual Garden Of Recovery Before My Birth. Trying To Understand Human Nature. And Why Wars Exist. It Probably Troubled Me & I Couldn’t Take It With My Hopeful Wish For The Future. That Was Sitting With Me In Those Dreams. I Still Wonder If My Birth Was The Day Of Onset. . . . . . . Selah!.
176186541,Brain damage tends to stick around even after the tumor is removed. Your doctor probably refused you because you had a normal neurological evaluation and did nit display other signs of a brain tumor. But brain tumors can cause psychosis and numbness and vision changes and migraines.

176186545,"I just piggyback on everyone’s high IQ around me, lol. But seriously, for me schizophrenia has gotten better with the right treatment routine. Indeed, I have been increasingly more stable with risperdal than I was with abilify. Also, I think a lot of it depends on certain variables such as stress and comorbid health issues, mental or physical. I’m not going to say that staying stable is completely in your control, but I will say you can do your part in helping your desired outcome."
176186546,"Please be careful. When I first started experiencing these kinds of delusions, I did not realize they were delusions and I played along. This delayed me getting the help that I really needed, and caused a lot of problems for me because I behave foolishly as a result of my mental illness. Unless you can communicate with somebody telepathically to the point where they can send you an email that says they hear your voice in their minds, I think you should take the mental illness hypothesis very seriously."

176186554,"I am thinking of lowering the dose, would dropping those 2mg increase my energy and make me sleep less or lowering will bring my delusions back?"

I think when it comes to fearing the nature of our reality you can find much entertainment value as well as education by enjoying the ride more so than fear why the ride is or where it is headed I think first you need to view yourself more as the brave protagonist rather than the helpless victim and then next realize that even though it does not seem that very many take this ride many who have went and created songs and stories based on their theories.

176186576,Did you guys save your IPEs? The agreement between you and ACCESS VR for the services you’re supposed to get? The IPE should tell you what kind of job they’re supposed to get for you on the cover. The IPE also indicates the service/deliverable codes.

174390100,"I’ve never been good at précis. This seems to be easier, Effect of Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) on time perception Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a behavioral disorder characterized by severe and pervasive impairment in several areas of development including but not limited to reciprocal skills, social interaction skills, communication & language skills. Apart from these struggles self-reports and reports from people (parents, teachers, and clinicians) having regular contact with people with ASD indicate that they often see them struggle with time perception and sense of time. Individuals with autism seem to have a basic inability to make sense of past and present experiences, which has to do with comprehending the passage of time and linking it with current ongoing activities.[121] Allman and _PERSON_ (2015) present three general trends in the research on abnormal timing and time perception in ASD. Firstly, studies concentrating on the sub-second range have tended to find superior temporal 
discrimination differences in people with ASD. Secondly, studies in the supra-second range have tended to find impairments in longer durations beyond the limits of the ‘psychological present’ of about 3 seconds as described by _NAME_ (1890) and connected with increased variability. Thirdly, there is initial evidence indicating problems with conceptual notions of time in ASD (Allman & Falter, 2015).[125] Effect of Schizophrenia on time perception Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior. Individuals suffering from schizophrenia have a varied perception of time compared to neurotypicals; also are less precise in judging the temporal order of events.[126][127] Time perception impairment in schizophrenia was originally described by clinicians and later addressed in laboratory. Past work on schizophrenics indicated a great impairment in time sensitivity and perception leading to overestimation of time intervals. Due to the cognitive impairm
ents that the disorder poses, there have not been any definitive conclusions about the nature of time perception irregularities. A recent study aimed to isolate a genuine time perception disorder (functioning of the internal clock) in schizophrenia by testing id the patients’ internal clock runs faster compared to healthy controls. Results indicated significant correlations between Time perception tasks and memory outcomes suggesting such impairments are directly related to memory impairment in schizophrenia.[128] Schizophrenia has been associated with abnormalities in dopamine (DA) transmissions (_PERSON_, 2006), which in turn, have been linked to the speed of the internal clock (_PERSON_, 2007). The time overestimation has been suggested to be caused by accelerated time processing and may be associated with psychosis (Droit-Volet and _PERSON_, 2007)[129] en.wikipedia.org Time perception | Effects of clinical disorders Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder often marked by 
either inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity that leads to impairment in social, academic or occupational activities. Some people can also show symptoms belonging to both subtypes. ADHD is linked to abnormalities in dopamine levels in the brain as well as to noticeable impairments in time perception.Numerous imaging studies have demonstrated that the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus (striatum) whic..."

After short time i started to hear them loud in ears they were people who commented my actions what i did in the past, but also they were arguing and screaming in my ears. I felt really scared, frightened by hearing these voices talking. I did not said anyone about this as i thought im going nuts and i believed my parents will lock me in a mental hospital forever, that were my thoughts about this. I could not endure anymore so i told my parents about hearing people talk in my ears. They took me to hospital i stayed inpatiant for like two weeks, in the last day there i jumped from first floor and broke my arm(elbow) and i could not walk for 2-3 days. They sent me with an ambulance at local hospital in town, i had surgery still have scars and such. To be brief i was having a hard time with voices i heard, i felt very scared and i tried to commit suicide becouse i couldnd tolerate anymore. I am

I think that goes into working on shaping your minds initial reactions, as some therapy tactics do"
176186639,or is it better to say “you should see a psychiatrist” and not argue with them? do professionals try to reason with the delusional? is there a different role for professionals and lay people in whether to argue?

176186661,"Actually, I thought that Led Zeppelin was considered the first heavy metal band."
176186662,"What the heck. This is racial discrimination/violence, not a ??????? mental illness."
176186663,"Right, so don’t take any more than 6 every 24 hours unless you’re feeling risky."
176186664,Sorry you had a bad day.
176186665,Yes. It was 2 weeks of hell though. I just drink decaff now out of habit.
176186666,Have you contacted a disability lawyer? Do you have someone who can financially support you for two years while you wait for disability and then you can pay them back when you receive it?
176186667,It’s been rough the last 8 months. I go to group therapy everyday. And I don’t really talk when I’m there. My family doesn’t really support me.
176186668,"House is a very triggering show for me as well. I cope with triggering media by just avoiding it, or not looking if someone else in the house is watching it. If I accidentally see something triggering, I will read a favorite story or watch a favorite cartoon to push it out of my mind."
176186669,Nah never done it. _PERSON_ dissolving in your mouth tastes foul. Ill hold it between the lips tho for a bit - whilst i pour out a glass of milk to take it with tho lol.
176186670,Love is a stretch for anything to me.
176186671,"It’s the nature of music to invite sociability. Ironically, I don’t mind being alone when there is good music. It reassures me that I’m alright. I don’t know how it does that, but it does."
176186672,My dad actually went to hospital for this cos on the phone they initially thought it may be something serious one reason being due to his age. They said to limit cofee to none or one per day. And they even prescribed him meds for it but he’s not taking it cos its gone down now
176186673,I feel the best Christmas gift I ever received was a simple gift of my gals love unconditional love.
176186674,I was not trying to encourage anyone else to stop theirs. It’s something I was dealing with at the time and I’m sorry if it came off that way.
176186675,"Volunteering with elders, going to group for people with mental health issues like clubhouses, browsing forums like this…"
176186676,"To have thoughts you will be abducted and tortured? I don’t want to get into the graphic details, but this is a recurring delusion that I have. I walk a lot and often think somebody will stop and abduct me and I will be tortured indefinitly."
176186677,There’s always been a street light or hall light shining in my window or door.
176186678,"Have you ever been scared blind? I was, in the 4th grade. Sitting around with the girls during recess, someone mentioned wanting to get married. Later, I went blind and ran into someone in the circle. Still don’t know who it was, but she hollered “Ow”. I decided then that it was better to be scared of my mother than to get married."
176186679,I’ve been to psych wards seven times from 2015 to 2019.
174390114,I was on 600 before and the hallucinations was worse they decreased it On 600 i was doing so so bad More is not always ok i guess? Are you on Clozapine too?
176186680,That’s great news. Glad it’s going in the right direction!
176186681,"Quetiapine is my goto Drug. Tho i admit ive not been on too many others. Ive usually been on the older Aps like Chlorpromazine and Stelazine in the past. Im supposed to take 25mg Quetiapine twice a day, but it sedates too much so i just take the 300mg at night. Ive got boxfulls of the stuff. But if im going downhill - i will up my dose. But mainly i rely on the monthly paliperdone jab to keep me well."

176186683,"If you are in a warped state of mind things can be interpited in the wrong way. If this just was a one off I wouldn’t read much into it. Anyways, pointing out your “non-perfectness” is probably a testament of their own insecurity."
174390102,Absolutely. Plenty of things like that with schizophrenia
176186684,db SNP???
176186685,That’s fine. :::)))))
174390103,Good luck and have fun!
176186686,nods I hope you find it. I’d probably do well to count my gifts more and try to find a good way to use them for better. Wishing you well squirrel.
174390106,"The meds I take help with my depression and anxiety, so there’s that. I suspect a more accurate diagnosis of my mental health would be closer to autism. I know they use the same drugs to treat autism as they do schizophrenia. I would feel much better about my diagnosis if I could say, I’m on the autism spectrum or I’m autistic which would explain why I have angry outbursts. The original doctor that diagnosed me schizophrenic is no longer my doctor. He got fired from his job due to a disagreement with his boss. My new doctor listens to me and I told him about my reasons for believing I was more than likely on the autism spectrum and not schizophrenic. He didn’t deny the facts I presented to him and agreed that I was more than likely autistic. He said I shouldn’t feel ashamed about my diagnosis of schizophrenia, but I do. I might ask him about requesting an evaluation to be done to see if I really am on the autism spectrum. I heard it can be expensive though and insurances might not cover i
t."
176186687,Nope. Not possible as I live with other people who bake.
176186688,I was embarrassed for a few months after my first psychotic break. But that’s as far as it goes really.
176186689,Any other opinions please?
176186690,Maybe I’ll email him.
176186691,I’m on Prozac and it seems to help. I haven’t had any side effects.
176186692,"I am mainly really nervous about my next therapy appointment. Mainly cuz two of my friends are going with me. Not in the room, but in the waiting room. They don’t like each other at all. And my voices won’t shut up about it. And i am really scared my besties will be at each others throats, while in the waiting room. As well as the fact i might get a new dynoises do to me not fully telling my therapist all my delusions and hulsanations frist off in the beginning. So i am really dreading Halloween. I keep getting overwhelming thoughts that i might lose my friends and my voices won’t quite talking about to ether… Sorry for the vent post. I just been dealing with alot lately."
174390113,You are exactly right. That’s why I explain it as schizophrenia and bipolar together at the same time.
176186693,"It’s almost sad to say, but I’m not counting on living late, don’t know if I want too… I’m content with it when it ends. Least I try to tell myself that. If my delusion is right, It’ll be worth all the suffering. If I’m wrong, it’s oblivion forever, which means peace. That’s all delusion, probably not real, but I’m still waiting to see. I’ve been around enough dying to know what to expect. laments We have to try to enjoy the time we have, as hard as that is some times. Enjoy what you can, even when it’s only seconds of peace at a time."
174390110,"SLeeping is my best time. I dream a lot, which leaves me exhausted by the time I wake up (today that was 13.40), but also entertained and ready to face my negatives of the day."
176186694,Play dreams on PS4. It’s a great game and you can dream while awake
176186695,"What about negatives - low motivation, anhedonia etc…?"
176186696,I have been with 86 women all in all…no I’m not ashamed about it…memories from those women is on my mind all the time…
176186697,"It is such a devastating word. It sounds powerful when people say it. The connotations are so encompassing. The fear of it, the _USER_ID_ of it and the feelings it generates for both the person who has it and the person saying it. I feel you. _PERSON_ up and carry on."

176186699,"_AT_MENTION_ you look very nice. I don’t spend a lot of time in the selfies thread anymore as I had a thing where I was worried about being recognized, but I’m sure there’s nothing wrong with the looks of anyone here. I feel pretty good about the way I look, although I want to go down roughly 1 standard jeans size. For some reason my face looks nice enough in the mirror to bad in a cell phone camera shot. Unless it’s a mirror shot. At my lightest I could look good in a straight on selfiee. At least I think so."
176186700,"A man built a wall. He ask his friend to judge his wall, as it had a few bad bricks in it. The man said i need to destruct the wall and build a new one. The bad bicks look fcked. His friend replied, i can hardly see the bad bricks, but i see all the other hundreds of good bricks. Keep the wall, its good. We all know our flaws of character, but we got to see our good sides as well. Focus on the good."
176186701,I feel a little better. I just finished emptying the dishwasher. It was work for me. I’m sweating profusely. It’s good advice to get busy.
174390115,What sympyoms you still have? Clozapine didn’t work? Maybe try Haldol? I heard its effective and fast.
176186702,big can be beautiful in the eyes of your loved one…I don’t love her any less.
176186703,"Only ever had _PERSON_ from a course of Haldol i was on years ago. With the Xeplion/Invega Jab - none whats so ever. On Seraqoul 300mg at night at well - so the side-effect of drowsiness is welcomed, i use it more as a sleep aid."
176186704,"I’ve tried meditation and it was great, I was feeling so good and didn’t realise I was psychotic so I quit meds cold turkey and everything was hell for 2-3 days when with my last introspective thought I took the medicine and pass on another unnecessary hospitalization. My advice is to start small, 7 minutes a day for a two weeks and carfull monitore yourself, then do 15 m a day but don’t increase your session more then that, it can be dangerous"
176186705,"Maybe it’s just me, but I was like super irrational… Like best way to explain itwoyld be when I learnt how to masturbate at like 18… so shortly after, I went to church and greeted the pastor, the next week when I went back to church, the pastor was gone; so in my mind am like it’s because he got sickened by seeing my sin and became sick over it… Like that’s damn as hell, but that’s another example of what I mean by delusional thinking. Like it’s sound like am a righteous person and just felt like the preacher saw my seem, but I mean I was like the preacher felt my sin… and that’s what I mean by delusional"
176186706,are there any benzos which dont cause tolerance if taken daily apart from lorazepam and alprazolam ?
176186707,Do you have low or high blood pressure? Usually these are the first things causing this.
176186708,"I’m working on a song, not sure what its gonna be about but its kind of a soft rock type deal. So far its just one verse, but Im really into it so far. Anyway I sang some random adlibs over it to get the feel down, but since I suck at singing Ive decided I want to pass the torch to someone else. Anyone think they can sing over this with the same general _NAME_ when its finished? I think it could be something special. Again, dont mind my crappy vocals"
176186709,"i really like the distorted synth you hear during the first break and then continues. Good that you extended it, i thought the first version was a bit short. I like longer songs. you gonna put the vocals on it again too?"
176186710,Cool. What rooms are they in?
176186711,Glad things are going well
176186712,My brother was a drug addict and I hated him for it. I avoid him at all costs these days. I don’t go to the expense of telling him that.
176186713,"With some members struggling with the delusion that they are part of a computer simulation, couldn’t it be dangerous for them to use VR in any way? Just curious"
176186714,"I sleep too much. About 12 hours on the average. Too much Seroquel, but I don’t want to mess with the dosage. I take Fanapt too. My voices are almost gone. I suppose I’d rather sleep a lot and have a minimum of symptoms then any other option. Once I’m awake I’m fine."
176186715,I eventually went back to bed.Slept for about 5 hours and have been up about 30minutes .
176186716,yea it makes it hard to trust the vaccine huh… im really pondering a lot over having the vaccine or not. So far it’s not something that will happen soon but when it comes to the time i’m not sure.
176186717,I think the difficult part is that I’m not growing in the usual sense of the word. It seems like I’m only learning and becoming more aware of my disability. So my efforts don’t really feel rewarded.
176186718,This topic was automatically closed 7 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.
174390112,Its hard to explain.
176186719,"I wouldn’t celebrate my last day, I would use it to make amends and try to be ready for death, but that’s just me."
176186720,I also heard Vraylar is a really good med and that it is weight neutral and the best for if you have problems with high cholesterol. I thought about switching to it too. But I am stuck on an injection.
176186721,I Told the girl I’m talking to that I have a problem And I said sorry if that was _PERSON_… She said that I could tell her anything
176186722,_AT_MENTION_ what do you think of the sub on this one? Usually I like my 808s but I think the _NAME_ beats pack let me down on this one lol
176186723,"Zoloft is a wonder drug for me after failing on paxil and lexapro. It got rid of my social anxiety almost completely and hugely helped my depression. Everyones different though, my sister took zoloft and immediately got suicidal thoughts. Go figure"

176186729,My husband takes it and no one has said anything about that
176186730,I have any independence too
176186731,I eat whole grains pasta almost every day. I need the fibers in the pasta and all the B vitamins and minerals. Besides of that I eat steamed veggies every day.
176186732,"I think it’s meds,and vaping.You changed highest dose of Invega pills to relatively weak antipsychotic,like Latuda.Can you use music on your phone as distraction?"
176186733,Delusion of reference I think is the term.
176186734,Haldol. I still take it prn 2x day for breakthrough psychosis. I got lockjaw and threw up and had to take cogentin.
176186735,"At least, you recognize it’s your paranoia"
176186736,"lots of people on here, including me, have talked about high prolactin levels. I got mine from taking Risperdal for so long, had leaking breasts, so I switched to Invega you should be working with your psychiatrist about this. Simple blood tests will confirm."
176186737,yeah that’s a good one. scientists can be hero’s.
176186738,I would say continue to take your meds.

176186740,Do u have any delusions now?
176186741,best of luck moonbeam…we’ll see you in a few weeks there or thereabouts
174390117,"Was on clozapine for about a week, and had to be taken off because of side effects"
176186742,Can it be a seizure epilepsy or something?
176186743,"I became psychotic after going off my medication and was given maintena 400 mg once a month for over a year. For about six months, I still was psychotic then after half a year went by, I became calm and coherent. I am glad I got the shot because I was incoherent, illogical, and irritable. I had to live near family who looked after me until I recovered. After six months, I was given 300 mg shots monthly since I calmed down. I felt well after a year of starting the shots. During the first six months of shots, I got kicked out of an apartment complex for being too loud inside my apartment. I was really insane, talked loudly and hit the walls out of rage. I was out of control. But, the shots starting working after six months. I talked normally again and lived with my family. I am now on the pill form 12-15 mg daily. I feel fine despite being tired. I have full emotions now and am calm most of the time now. I am also working and living on my own. I wanted to go on disability at the time of my psychosis. 
I was told I should work so here I am working. I am looking into grad school online. I want to write for a living, may be a fantasy, but I want to turn it into a reality."
176186744,I’m not depressed _AT_MENTION_
176186745,Before meds yes. Had racing thoughts and it was hell. Nowadays it’s a lot better. I am even less obsessional about things. It is a big relief.
176186746,I used to a lot but I quit in my 20s. I have had a few times in the last couple of years but I get really sick an hour later so there’s no real point to it for me. I agree with _AT_MENTION_ it is much better than alcohol.
174390125,"Meds: Geodon (positive symptoms) Haldol (as a PRN only) Wellbutrin (negative symptoms and suicidal ideation) Supplements: Amyloban 3399 (boosts my AP, helps reduce nerve pain) Sarcosine (helps with cognition) _NAME_ oil in diffusers (proven to help with memory) Matcha green tea capsules (multiple benefits)"
176186747,Let us know how it goes! Good luck!
174390119,Sarcosine makes me hyper active. At the same time I feel tired from being hyper active.
174390133,Has it helped with your voices since taking suntheanine?
176186748,Thanks! It’s good to be back.

176186750,You can experiment and see what your limits are.
176186751,"I’m usually aware of when I’m hallucinating, or in a delusional way of thinking. I just deal with it and go about my day. I’m fact, hallucinations and delusional thinking is a regular thing for me. Perhaps you’re right. Maybe the hallucination or delusion I experienced just somehow happened to “sync” with whatever potential ailment I was experiencing… Hadn’t thought of that. I’ve been so scared. I’ll get the physical pain checked out if it doesn’t go away by the time I’ve slept. I’d be relieved to discover maybe it’s really unrelated."
176186752,Pre-sz is an interesting way of putting it. Weren’t we all a lot younger then?
176186753,I’m afraid people are trying to deceive me and tell me I’m not on camera when I really am.
176186754,"I was so mi that I don’t remember everything. I’m sza, so maybe it helped with the mood component which limited other symptoms."
176186755,Glad to know it’s working for you!
176186756,"I just started going out with friends, driving, and exercising at home. They want me to go with them to the gym and cinema this week. Cinema I can but gym I have to force myself and think about it."
176186757,Who’s first = the chicken or the egg? Pain is caused by tension which is caused by conflict which got silenced = imo.
176186758,Sorry but that’s psychological.
176186759,_AT_MENTION_ oh okay… I hadn’t heard of it lol
176186760,Me too! She and also pat deegan!
176186761,That must be scary.
176186762,_NAME_ is the exact version of me but he’s smarter and more successful lol. “Hooray”! But anyway i like you’re avatar too. Is awesomesauce
176186763,"Keep hope, you never know when you will get better."
176186764,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . You have a good one too.
176186765,"But sometimes, i feel like a compromised person."
176186766,yea i want be 200 by december im 260 now. long way go. its so hard to stick on a diet. i feel so hungry.
176186767,Maybe GTA6 will be out
174390129,I know that this site is promed but maybe you’re from the rare people who can live without meds and just have mild symptoms. Personally if my symptoms were mild I would have stopped meds but sadly they aren’t and I even get violent without meds.
174390123,I was diagnosed in 78. I never went off on my medicine. Exercise helps.
176186768,"I’m slightly stressed today but a little more than I think I should be. Typically, I take a half day or something to cope but tomorrow is full of things I can’t easily move and doing so may just make things more stressful. Stress tends to cause me some weird thoughts. Today’s example, the people in my head are around (they aren’t here every day) and they’re telling me they’re in the basement. I know it’s fake but it’s still kinda scary. Any distressing techniques y’all use during the day would be greatly appreciated. I’m going to do some breathing. I just don’t want the people to start feeling more real than they do right now. Life is going really good right now."
174390132,I hope they’re right …
176186769,"My dad created our property across the street into a small forest. The trees were all evergreens. We didn’t need to buy them as they were on our property. We grew up very much in the country and did not rely on other people. We had a bit of a farm, but mostly when I was young. Our huge garden survived until we moved cross country. I am, deep inside, a country girl. But now I’m a city girl and sometimes I really miss the ocean and land to play on. Good times."
174390137,"yeah. I agree that a roommate would be something to look into, although, in my past supportive apartments, I had great trouble with some of my roommates because I got really paranoid about them and it was MISERY to share a place with someone whom you think has it in for you. Lately, my positive symptoms have been out of hand. i don’t think i could swing living independently…although it kills me to say that. Maybe it is a temporary downswing. Maybe given some time, things in my head will improve but right now … I’ve been scouting around the Assisted Living facilities near me. I would really like it if I could find one that would take me. I am almost too physically disabled for them at accept me and SZ is the kiss of death. NO facility wants a liability like that."
176186770,"It was a part of FEMA Corps, which is a part of AmeriCorps NCCC."
176186771,I know you are disappointed _AT_MENTION_ . But I think your Pdoc is doing the right thing. I heard the side effects from Risperidol will mitigate after taking it more than 5 years.
176186772,"Nobody wants you dead, you have to keep believing that. If people wanted you dead, you would be dead. People just don’t care, most of them don’t even notice you passing them by. Mind reading doesn’t exist. It’s just paranoia, man… paranoia means you need to up your dose or maybe contact your pdoc for a med change… Stay strong."
176186773,"I’ve been at my janitor job 8 years. It’s not too hard physically. I have a bad back and I can still do it. Basically, it’s vacuuming, emptying wastebaskets and cleaning restrooms in an office building. Also, mopping floors. We do a few other things too. I’m 60 years old and I’ve had a lot of different jobs, like maybe 30 since my first job as a dishwasher at age 17. I think this job is my favorite. I’ve stocked shelves, worked in restaurants, worked in warehouses, I was a park ranger, done general maintenance work, been a security guard, worked at gas stations, been a driver, done A LOT of just general yardwork which was anything from weeding lawns to digging out tree stumps. But this job just fits me best on many levels. I make $16.00 an hour which is the best I’ve ever been paid. I have a bad back and suffer from fatigue which makes me take twice as long to do stuff than it used to. My boss never says a word about how slow I am; I’ve been slow the last 5 years. I think that it’
s because all my co-workers are slow too. My company hires disabled people and veterans. I always used to advise people, there are jobs out there where you can just get lucky and find your niche. Sometimes you just stumble on a job where everything clicks and the job isn’t too hard or your co-workers are cool to you or it pays well. These jobs are out there but you often can’t tell unto you actually get the job and start working there. By the way, restaurant jobs aren’t that bad. They ain’t exactly hard labor. I thought a driving job would be fun. I had two different ones. They were actually kind of OK except I live in one of the most traffic congested areas in California. Warehouse work can be pretty simple and straightforward."
176186774,I have long stopped dreaming. Now my aim is to be self-supporting.
176186775,"It was ok. I ate leftovers and Indian takeout because I hurt my back. I messaged with friends a bit, so I didn’t feel entirely alone. My brother visited last weekend and we made dinner, so I’m sort of counting that as my Thanksgiving."
176186776,I’m glad for you.
176186777,I see. What can you do now? Is your bf there? Do you have anyone to talk to? You have us here
176186778,you cant get a 5-day override? (that’s like loaning meds)
176186779,I can’t have a partner either due to sz.
176186780,I can now hear the neighbors talk about me Slamming shot around. We can’t afford to move Everytime . Taking a piss is fun when you’re a ????? and a ????. I hate these ????????. I’d rather be in a ward.
176186781,what you work at _AT_MENTION_
176186782,My therapy got Cancelled. Before I drive I agree it’s just hard because I have “bad habits” to talk about drugs. I’ve tried to make it more metaphorical and negative and realistic but I still waste a lot of lines on talking about drugs. They call em “filler lines” in rap. But all the slangs are Easy to fit in but it distracts from the real purpose which is why I valued your insight _PERSON_ has a line on slim shady lp “they say I can’t talk about drugs anymore”. So yeah. You get the pictures on that point. I tend to get ranty. I write one 60 bar verse and then split it up into 3-4 verses afterwards. I definitely don’t plan much making my music.

176186792,"I would sit down with your mom for a talk about this. You might be worrying prematurely. It doesn’t hurt to make plans for the future and explore some possibilities though but don’t panic, you probably have some time to think about it. Just weigh some options about how you’re going to live once she is gone."
176186793,Mine have been giving me horrible nightmares/visions when I close my eyes and they mess with me as they become my ex boyfriend and then play death metal music. They make me have extremely uncomfortable conversations with them mentally when this occurs. Today they have made me sleep a ton since they have given me insomnia the last two nights. I really hope you’re voices stop harassing you. I know how traumatizing it can be to deal with day and night. Just know you are not alone!
176186794,Sorry I missed this at first. I am very glad you are back.

Now I just deal with hallucinations. The most important thing is to get him good medication, and you can ask to sit in on the appointments with him, my mom did this for me starting with my first episode and it really helped me get the right meds, I’d just hang my head and say everything was fine if she didn’t come in with me and tell them how I was acting around the house. It’s a horrible disorder but partial recovery is possible. Also, my 21 year old brother is on League of Legends on his PC all the time and he doesn’t have a mental illness. A lot of people that age isolate, it would be cool if he could go to some meetups and make friends to meet up with though, just to get out. I wish you the best, sorry you have to deal with all this.

Then either canned chicken and salsa and cheese or just salsa or just cheese, whatever you’re in the mood for. Frozen meatballs can be used for all kinds of things. Same with frozen hamburger patties.

176186881,"TRIGGER TRIGGER WARNING WARNING (unless you don’t mind gory drug stories) Mine was January 29th of 2010 when I had a bad lsd trip. Well it wasn’t just a bad trip. And I’m not sure of what really happened After all they never put their hands on me physically But were abusive AF whether I was on drugs OR NOT. But I was on drugs. Probably about 500 ug (1/2 a milligram which is a lot for those who don’t know). I think when I talk of this people often don’t understand the true implications of this, unless they did lsd themselves. I mean how could they??? But everyone I know who I explained my lsd trip too who has done drugs like these themselves say like “I can’t believe that fn happened to you”. Just the idea of a trip being disrupted by any outside force is a pure terror. Meanwhile not into these drugs tend to misunderstand or just prefer to not comment on it. Well I’m explaining here. Well _NAME_ in the 60s talked about “set and setting”, “set and setting”, “set and settin
g” etc etc etc etc etc. How important it is on these drugs. I’d say 97% of bad trips come from being in the wrong set and setting or just not able to “let go”. Well I wasn’t able to do either. I mean who would be able to “let go” and say “this is all good ” if you were 19 years old on 500 mcg of lsd and people are throwing knives near your head and ??????? with you and stealing from you and messing with every function of your being from different angles (multiple people) with no breaks on a 8 hour span. Well I completely lost control. Was unable to speak until I started chugging vodka to get my “ego back” so I could yell at them to get out of my house they were never invited into. And then wanting to kill them, my abuser from childhood calls me on the phone and says “YOUR EGO!!!” I mean my trip was gonna end, maybe I’d go back to school and be a bit messed up. But when this happened??? Delusions went into my head. I had became interested with “the ego” already in its flaws and 
imperfections. And then the nerve to say “YOUR EGO” to me while I was still tripping. On these drugs, everything you witness seems really significant already, but the way my friend said it to me and when and how and who he was. It affected me worse than the drug itself. I will always remember that day. It was supposed to be the last time I was gonna do this drug for…a while id say. And I had planned on this experience two months previously!!! Yes, I wasn’t so reckless back then. I actually would plan these experiences weeks or months in advance like you should. But I guess I didn’t prepare for the worst. Thank you for letting me share."

176186904,It is what it is. I think it becomes problematic when it becomes about personalities and not about the politic. It’s not an easy thing for most. We all have different ideas. I think a more rational and open approach is what is needed rather than slamming bans on people for sure. How you do that practically is another issue. I miss _AT_MENTION_ .

174390167,You would have to take pharmacology and university courses on biology & chemistry or biochemistry. Majority of the anti-psychotic drug companies are located in the US.

176186922,"I completely understand. I have multiple diagnoses, and each doctor disagrees. My major problem was slapped with fibromyalgia label, but I’ve been told by two different doctors they think it is sero negative lupus, which other doctors uave said doesn’t exist. I have all the symptoms of lupus but no blood markers except elevated segmentation rate when a flare up is going on. So I HAVE something(s) going on aside from the stuff they know, but no one can figure out what. It’s frustrating at the very least. Maddening mostly. But you can’t lose hope. After a few years my symptoms began to settle down. They really settled after I began a fitness routine. I don’t do it now but it did put a huge block in place so that today I don’t have flares as seriously as 5 years ago. You can start small and work up. Any activity is so.ething. get 1 pound weights."

176186928,"I never had a “I am Jesus” delusion, but I think lusting over women is a sin, which I do a lot, and bothers me morally. Watching porn is a sin, but then my sins were forgiven, so there’s that. But if I keep doing it, then I’m morally bankrupt, I guess. I blame my upbringing and my dad a bit."

176186938,"So I have some delusions running through my head. Mostly of some religious connotation. Like I’m going to be the next pope or priest. This doesn’t even make sense because I only attend church once a year at best. And I have the feeling I’m going crazy and have voices calling me a meth or crack head, both which I’ve never done.

Today I struggled for hours to get out of bed, tried to play a game, instantly became overwhelmed and gave up, was stuck laying on the couch for a good while and then went back to bed. The only thing that got me moving again was when he called to check in on me and encouraged me to get up and do something. After a LOT of encouragement and pushing and me coming near tears I was finally able to get up and put the dishes away. It just baffles me. How can I perform well at my challenging job and then be like this when at home? I am especially worried because shortly our work will be switching to 12 hour shifts, so I will only be working 3 days a week. That is even more days I will have off and will potentially be alone. I want to be able to do fun things on my days off. I also want to be able to contribute to chores. I need to figure out how to manage this"
176186955,"Hi. I have been on risperdal injections for over 2 years now. First it was 75 mg every 14 days = 5.36mg/day Then it was 50 every 10 days = 5mg/day Then it was 50 every 14 days = 3.5mg/day Now it is 37.5 every 14 days = 2.7mg/day This lowering of the dose happened over a period of 2 years. At first, I gained 80 pounds (165 to 245) I dieted, and lost 15 pounds. Why isn’t the reduction in medication not taking weight off (the same weight that was originally added from the first dose level). I don’t understand. Any information would help. Thank you, _NAME_"

176186962,"Why, what did they do?"
176186963,"_AT_MENTION_ , the main med causing me problems was Olanzapine, in saying that the other ones (sodium valproate) I was on weren’t doing me any good either, the side effect warnings around weight was on both of them, but, the doctor was fairly adamant it was the Olanzapine causing me the problems. I put on 30kgs and he wasn’t all that phased, even when my bloodwork came back saying I was now at risk of diabetes. I will have to investigate both of the ones you recommend at the chemist and see what I can get. I’m fairly desperate to find something to help as what I am doing now isn’t really working. I haven’t gained further weight, but, I haven’t exactly lost any either. I feel in limbo and losing motivation/patience rather rapidly."

174390210,Your problem isn’t medication it’s that you’re over medicated. You need to except the fact that you might need medication for life. I’ve got schizophrenia 25 years ago. The more times you stop medication and have a psychotic break the harder it is to recover. Stability is key to over coming this illness. I’m on 10 mgs of Zyprexa. I decided way back in 1997 that if I was going to take meds it would have to be on a dose I could function. It took me about 5 years to recover. A common mistake doctors make is too high of a dose. Patients feel over medicated and want to stop their meds. The reason doctors prescribe too high of a dose is they want results fast. I decided that if I was going to take medication for life it was going to be on my terms and it had to be at a level I could handle.

We aimed to synthesise the findings of trials which have included these biomarkers to determine which may be most useful for predicting nutraceutical response in mood and psychotic disorders. Methods: A systematic review was conducted assessing available literature concerning nutraceutical clinical trials in mood and psychotic disorders (major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) with baseline and endpoint blood nutrient markers or genetic data available. Results: We identified 35 eligible studies (total n?=?3836 participants) examining baseline and endpoint nutrient biomarkers and/or genetic pol
ymorphisms. The key result, as reported in 10 out of 11 omega-3 studies, was a strong association between polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations (mostly EPA and DHA) and psychiatric outcomes, although the exact nature of the association varied between studies and diagnoses. There was no consistent evidence for levels of other nutrients (including Vitamin D, _NAME_/SAH ratios, carnitine, folate and vitamin B12) relating to treatment response. The evidence for associations between one-carbon cycle genotypes (e.g. MTHFR C677?T, MTR and FOLH1) and treatment response was also inconsistent. Discussion: The available data tentatively supports omega-3 indices as biomarkers of response to omega-3 treatments in mood disorders. Further research with larger samples examining combinations of polymorphisms is required to determine if any genetic factors influence nutraceutical response in mood and psychotic disorders."

So I felt by doing drugs and drinking I was “catching up” to everybody else in society, mental-wise. So I knew something was wrong with me I was just very offbase. I had a theory that everyone in high school drank and did drugs and that’s what kept them in connection with reality. Because drinking and doing drugs, helped give me more insight into reality. You see what im saying?? So the 4 years of HS I didn’t drink or take drugs, it caused set backs. Really, I probably wasn

174390249,"Thank you for your concern but I am fine. I’ve just been dealing with depression since I was 14, but I am able to tolerate it and force myself to do things these days. As for your question, yes I switched from Invega to Geodon, though if you are schizo-affective depressive type, there are a few other medications that help with both schizophrenia and depression. Four that I can think of are Fluphenazine, Latuda, Vraylar and Geodon. Fluphenazine may make some people sleepy but that goes away most of the time. Latuda has mixed results, but if you increase the dose to the max and it isnt effective then you have become tolerant to it which is common. Geodon is very sweating for the most part, but look at me… This is My 4th day taking it in the morning and night and it doesnt make me sleepy anymore. Then there is vraylar which is very new, very expensive. There are mixed results with that one too from people going manic-psychosis to being able to have no voices and be productive with executive functi
oning which is what I lack to a degree. The first thing I would recommend you doing is get a DNA test to see which antipsychotic, antidepressant and anticonvulsant you will have the least amount of side effects on. From there it should be easier for you to follow through. But I will temper you, even if a DNA test shows any drugs with the least amount of side effects, there WILL be side effects on them still. It just depends on how you can tolerate them. Oh! Also, this is the second time I took geodon in the morning and forgot to eat food with it. The first time I had withdrawals and today… None. Weird?

Do any of you have experience with Belviq? If so, what can I discuss with my psychiatrist to convince her and myself that this could help me and I could still be stabilized on my meds? Thanks!"

176187273,"In my case when I wanted to marry I never told my husband-to-be of my sza as I thought it was just depression and that it was cured. Although I did relapse shortly before the time, I thought it was just stress as there were big changes in my life. 2012 was a hectic year for me. Then the following year I was told I still have schizo. With him also, he told me of epilepsy but he didn’t say anything about his mental health problems. It was a gradual disaster and now our marriage has ended. It’s sooooo important to tell a committed partner of your illness. Otherwise it could end in big problems"

Because of this, I don’t want to be in highly responsible positions. I have realized through time my judgment is not the best and need other’s advice. I try to do the best with what I have. But, my poor judgment has made me non-compliant in the past which has led to other bad decisions. I’m blessed to be working now and surviving. It is hard to be on one’s own. But, I have curtailed my interactions with negative people. This has helped a lot. I got involved with other people who just wanted to take advantage of me. It hurt me alot. I got over it though and realize I have a tendency to attract abusive people. Thus, I try not to become too involved with others. I have compassion still for others. However, I don’t get too involved emotionally with other people anymore. I have enough problems by myself. I don’t need to involve others in my lif

Then for a few days out of the month I get my “real” period that is very heavy and after that I get my 1 week period free. When I continued to gain weight even after my hormonal IUD was taken out I was suspicious she had put in another hormonal one on accident maybe. But my hormonal one made my period very light and late and I did not have bleeding outside of it. So its probably unlikely. All I know is before the hormonal iud I did not have any trouble maintaining my weight and now it is almost impossible not to gain.

When you are poor, often you become more liberal because you need help and understand what it means to be in need. I’ve also noticed that the most generous people I know are typically poor or have been very poor at some point. Once you’ve been needy you try to give to help other needy people. By giving money, buying them things they need, giving them help by offering time and physical help, or casting votes that help push through bills that help the poor or disenfranchised."

Nice that it happened but pretty meaningless now."
176187398,"In 2016 I went to Greece with my sister on holiday and it was all-inclusive so means free alcoholic drinks, I drank everyday, one point falling into our private pool fully clothed and my sister had to drag me out plus we had our apartment burgled as I left the doors open. She said I was a nightmare and said she’s never going on holiday with me again. anyway she just text me and said she’s booking a cottage in Cornwell with her friend this September and if I could like to come along. This makes me feel really good and I’m happy."
176187399,"I took an English/grammar test, provided a writing sample, took a math test, answered some trivia questions and a whole bunch of memory stuff. It took all day long. For the memory stuff they tell you to remember something and then distract you with other conversation and then ask you to tell them what you were supposed to remember. I don’t think I did very well on that part. My short term memory isn’t good. I think I did well on the rest of it though. Your doctor is just being thorough. Try your best."
176187400,Yesterday night while falling asleep I saw and felt an electric spark from my head and I heard the sound. I thought electricity went out but it wasn’t. It wasn’t static electricity from my hair bcz it never happened with my pillow. Also since I was 15 y.o. I would hear electricity from the inside of the back of my brain. I can feel it with blood flow. I told my psy and he said he doesn’t know. Its like electricity in my brain and nerves. _AT_MENTION_ Did you experience this? Electricity?

176187403,"In my experience, all the effective weight loss pills are dangerous for your heart. Ephedrine, caffeine, etc. They all work by increasing your heart rate. And they are all drugs. Don’t let the “all natural” label fool you. If something can make you lose weight, it does so by the same basic method."
176187404,"I’m not very well defined in a way I like either. Maybe you just got to accept it. Like “Ok I’m odd, these are very odd thoughts, I’m behaving oddly now, that’s just the way I am.”"

176187410,I wasn’t told in what way although I’ve heard oral can cause mouth cancer. I wouldn’t want anal because I don’t like the idea of my colon being used for anything other than making bowel movements. Bad memories of mother chasing my around the house with an enema.
176187411,"Sorry to post a negative, I try not to make posts like this because I don’t want to come off as needy or obnoxious, but I’m really having a tough time tonight. I messed up my sleep schedule the last couple of days and I woke up at midnight, now I have to stay up through morning and try to make it to the night before I go to sleep. I’m up, alone, and we’re out of cokes. I really needed that cola with my pizza, I should have put one aside when we were low. Little things out of sorts like that can really cause me trouble. Ice water from the tap tends to make me nauseous. Anyway I keep getting dark thoughts like how horrible my life is and how wrecked I am and how I’ll never be better. I’ve improved a lot over the last few years, but all that does is make me more presentable to others, it doesn’t really lessen my suffering that much. I still feel like total crap even though I’m not delusional. And the voices, they have been so bad the last few days. They are quiet so far today but I don
’t know if that will last. I just want to talk to my mom or drive to Taco Bell like I did in California. I hate it here in VA so much. No car, no friends, my mom’s not here, and the food sucks. I don’t know if I can make it through the next two months before the move. I’m not asking for answers because I spent years doing that and I’ve asked every possible question at least twice now. I just wanted to post my troubles and be heard, and maybe get some general support or tips or something. I also feel like I’m out of pharmaceutical options, as changing APs is risky, and I can’t up my dose because I already dedicate two hours of my time a day to walking in circles in the garage because of the akathisia Thanks guys."

I didnt eat sugar or bread/pasta/etc, except for one occasion (the lunch in a restaurant i already had an appointment for). My sugar cravings are much less today, i dont really feel a need for sugar. Im feeling better already in several ways. I just had to pay for the restaurant dinner with stomach problems and fatigue, even the next day still. I want to find out what caused it…sugar? Bread? Something else? Im proud im going off sugar and other additives. I want to keep that diet."
176187426,Do you take meds?
174390298,"Sorry I keep posting this but I keep adding to it. Reasons to be cheerful: I underestimate faint voices, they also feel real. I got faint voices before in October 2018 from the TV delusion. Also got them before in July/August 2017. That feeling of them ‘with me’ I had in Dublin for ages just before hearing voices: I had that same feeling at home but didn’t hear voices. _PERSON_ stopped it.i also figured out from this that the feeling is related to stress, as I was stressed out at the time. the voices felt VERY real that time that time in Dublin .It only came back because I was away in Dublin cmon the realization of this is important!(18th). Prior to that it was gone after the two weeks and four days The voice got quieter the closer I got to home that time coming home from Dublin and another time it stopped. They tried to trick me by saying ‘we don’t want anybody to know were putting ya under the pressure’ I questioned if it was schizophrenia in the midst of the main voices. I also disco
vered it was influenced by my thoughts. I also questioned it another separate time where I thought I’m either really sick or it’s real. I challenged the voice to turn up the volume. It said nothing. I questioned the possibility of being able to see out of anyone’s eyes and it felt too far fetched. I then came to the conclusion it was all in MY head. I challenged them towards the end of hearing voices and they lost all power, I said sorry to them because I felt bad. Things came to a natural conclusion they lost power and the meds stopped them"

176187456,"There’s not enough information presented here. Just being on antipsychotics isn’t good enough. First of all, how are they defining “recovery?” Second, what sort of treatment was given to the people not on meds? Third, did those who aren’t on meds take AP’s for some period of time before coming off of them? Did they include people who stopped their meds against the recommendation of their doctors? Are we including sza’s who may not be on the correct mood stabilizers and antidepressants needed to keep them stable?"

176187486,"Essentially what happens is sensory input gets crossed. Some people hear colour or taste sounds, some assign personalities to words, and some smell textures. The combinations are endless. I guess the downside is it’s hard to convey to others what you mean by the words you use for what you’re perceiving. One composer yelled at his orchestra to “play more green”, for an examole"

176187521,It sounds like you don’t have any lingering bitterness over the relationship. That’s good. Some people are easier to like from a distance.
174390312,"According to a study in my country more than 50% of young people diagnosed with sz had recovered when on medication after 4 years. Meaning they were showing no symptoms while medicated. Actually that can be considered lucky. 10% of those 50% (5%) were able to manage life without medication. Still I think you should keep your hopes up. I know I would if I was your age. Believing that you can recover, and maybe even manage without medication is half the job. In fact I still believe I may be able to quit one day. They say symptoms get better for many with age"
176187522,"A 20% improvement is the minimum to be considered effective. Many people do get more improvement than that. It’s individual though so you could have 0% improvement or 75% improvement, they are averaging together the responses of the people in the study - although the response rate does include only those who got more than 20% better. One thing about these studies though is they were on people who were already stable on antipsychotics. So if they had already improved on whatever they were already on, and then improved further on _PERSON_, that would be pretty good."
176187523,Worked great for me! Just had to take me off because of the weight gain!
176187524,Frequently I seem to offend people by using aggressive tone of the voice. The problem is I feel like thats just my natrual way of talking and its not something _PERSON_ ever aware of until people point it out. Often _PERSON_ only mildly annoyed and not even angry and yet my friends seem to say I sound very aggressive/pissed off. Does anyone else get this? What can I do to change this?

176187576,I think that was hypnogogic. You can’t get a sz diagnosis with that. I think there is a bit of a disagreement on how the illness works that’s all. Like we hear voices because we have high dopamine levels not we have high dopamine levels because we hear voices. I see I had symptoms because of things I started to believe in. Not because there is something wrong in my brain. I know people are not going to exactly listen to me on that so I don’t see a point in arguing. All I know is that is the reason I got better so I must have got something right.

I haven’t had voices in many, many months. Almost no bounds of psychotic symptoms. Sure, it could be because I’m on meds that work. But you know what happened when I went off them due to finances? My mood got worse. Much worse. Contemplating suicide worse. But no psychosis. If sz was all I have, then my moods wouldn’t be as shift and intense as they are.

174390339,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Impaired olfactory ability associated with larger left hippocampus and rectus volumes at earliest stages of schizophrenia: A sign of neuroinflammation? _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, CF _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, PD _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Wood and _PERSON_, Psychiatry research, Apr 23 2020 Impaired olfactory identification has been reported as a first sign of schizophrenia during the earliest stages of illness, including before illness onset. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between volumes of these regions (_USER_ID_, hippocampus, gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex) and olfactory ability in three groups of participants: healthy control participants (Ctls), patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FE-Scz) and chronic schizophrenia patients (Scz). Exploratory analyses were performed in a sample of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis in a co-submission paper (_PERSON_, 2020). The relationship to brain struct
ural measures was not apparent prior to psychosis onset, but was only evident following illness onset, with a different pattern of relationships apparent across illness stages (FE-Scz vs Scz). Path analysis found that lower olfactory ability was related to larger volumes of the left hippocampus and gyrus rectus in the FE-Scz group. We speculate that larger hippocampus and rectus in early schizophrenia are indicative of swelling, potentially caused by an active neurochemical or immunological process, such as inflammation or neurotoxicity, which is associated with impaired olfactory ability. The volumetric decreases in the chronic stage of Scz may be due to degeneration resulting from an active immune process and its resolution."

174390340,Stress makes symptoms worse. It’s still worthwhile talking to a shrink. They usually have better experience with mental disorders. You’ll find it’s more a spectrum thing anyways…there’s depression and anxiety and schizophrenia and bipolar and many symptoms often overlap. These days it’s more about treatment anyways and usually that means medications if your multi episodic or your issues continue to affect your function. I’m glad your seeking help.

My sleep overall has been improving lately since I started taking seroquel again at night. My overactive bladder I just cannot seem to get under control and it is a massive nuisance. The PCOS and insulin resistance I am almost entirely sure are weight related and I am currently focused on having a healthier diet with an appropriate amount of calories so I can hopefully lose some of this weight though historically I do not have a great history of losing a lot of weight and what weight i do lose i tend to regain when i have any sort of life stressor.

176187658,I’m no expert. It just seems to take a bit to get going. I’d imagine that going up or coming down in doses would be different but that would be guesswork. As always talk to your doc. A good shrink gets to know their patients and gets an idea from other patients.

Your body doesn’t want to respond to anything."

For anyone that doesn’t know what “off-label” is: All drugs are approved by the government as a treatment for a given problem but doctors can prescribe any medication for any reason. If the reason isn’t for the government approved treatment it is “off-label”. For example, Trazodone is approved by the government for depression but doctors prescribe it “off-label” for insomnia."

There are many unique experiences to have and I don’t want to see you missing out on them because of delusions. You are a cool guy _AT_MENTION_ , put on some tunes and try to accomplish a task or just entertain yourself. Keep a log of that if you would like, just try to focus on what you can do and how you can interact, looking back 
on ones actions can preserve a line of thought to some extent and from that you may be able to see flaws in your thinking which in turn can invalidate your delusions.

176187796,"Are you poking fun, or honestly trying to just uplift me? My “art” is not art. It was grandiose thinking and immaturity, I know that now. Everyone knew this but me, I mean I knew it on some level, some of the time. But here I am replying, sticking around when it’s clear, again to everyone but me, that I’m their toy. Just a goober. Two of my sisters called me a mentally slow psychopath to my face, they smiled so much when saying that to me because they knew I did understand that was what they were saying and that I would do nothing about it. It must be very obvious that I’m something sick and horrid. I lie and manipulate a lot, I know people can see it. It’s probably beyond my control, but I swear I never wanted to really be this."

176187809,Yes_PERSON_ like to lose another 14 pounds to be exact. Maybe you’re right and it’s just cause I haven’t hit my goal weight yet… I’m still considered overweight for my height so I could lose some more weight. _AT_MENTION_
176187810,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Should we close down the thread that I’ve created and just keep this one only?
176187811,"Welcome to the forum. Yes, they really work. I was psychotic for a long time in my most recent episode until I was put on an AP and then shortly thereafter I came out of it. And I haven’t had an episode since I’ve been on one consistently. I don’t think that’s a coincidence."
176187812,"I’m sorry you had a bad day. I understand your fear of others making fun of you, because I’ve been in this exact situation, and my coworkers did make fun. I had to leave in an ambulance due to hallucinations and confusion on the job, and ever after, most of them (not all!) were very dismissive and condescending toward me. There was one person who stood up for me, shaming them for mistreating an ill person, which really did make a difference. I still felt worthless and hopeless and embarrassed, and eventually quit the job, but knowing there are folks out there who are decent makes me optimistic about the future for us."

176187818,"I did a gender test on the BBC website about 5 years ago. It took about an hour and it tested things such as finger length ratio, ability to see visual patterns, face shape preferences, etc etc. It wasn’t trivial. I came out as a 2 out of 7 on the male side of the axis, so I’m sort of more towards the center of the continuum as regards gender. I always found that my softness and kindness got a favorable reaction from people. Guys who are too masculine and hardheaded just end of alienating everyone around them and people abandon them in the end."

The focus is always just the victims."

176187849,People and things in their places make me feel secure. When everyone is home I feel safe. When everything is put up I feel comforted. When everyone is running around town and everything is out of order I feel very unsafe and like I have no security at all.

176187852,"I was wondering if people can actually find out background information on people. Like can people find out if someone has a mental illness? I was wondering because just certain people I associate with or just talk to that I don’t know very well seem to give me a hard time and it just seems like they know what I have. Could it be possible that they would know? I’m not sure if this is a delusion or if people really do harass people, because they can actually look into your medical records and know what you are going through."
174390412,"My psychiatrist is good, but believes in past lives though…reincarnation. Mine is different. Mine is according to MWT of QM, not plain old reincarnation into a different body at a different era. It’s the same time. I used to be able to switch bodies but not sure how that is done. I was originally a young buy in _NAME_ Hospital with autism…I ended up being a professor in astronomy. I don’t remember that life except the torture and experiment part. I think _NAME_ was a Nazi, but he also had a soft spot for us kids. They say we are immortal time travelers or vampires. I have this ability. The Illuminati trapped me into a time loop with schizophrenia. Been like this for eternity. I can change the past with my mind. The shadow government is real as well as the Illuminati. Been in it before. Unfortunately, no body believes me. I think that’s why the aliens are so into me because I was the world’s first autistic kid. But yes, I would see a new doctor if it bothers you. I like mine."

176187877,I’ve always enjoyed a good rumination.
174390415,"It’s pretty complicated. (begin unusual belief) When you’re “deep” in the schizophrenic hole, higher levels of conscious take an interest in your affairs, and communicate with you indirectly, through the consciousness of other people. That’s where you get those “secret messages”, and sometimes entire strings of back-and-forth dialogue. If you’re deep enough, it can feel like you’re the only person in existence, and that reality itself only exists for your pleasure. If you treat the schizophrenia thoroughly enough, and mitigate the brain inflammation to the minimum, your brain stops churning out endless adrenaline, which would otherwise oxidize and form the LSD-like psychedelic adrenochrome, and cause you to trip 24/7 and have those metaphysical experiences. You become normal. Aware that you’re just another fairly unremarkable face among billions. Those “higher levels of consciousness” lose interest in you. Life begins anew. (end unusual belief)"
174390414,"I’m thinking of quitting Vraylar or going down on it to 4.5 mg. I’m at 9 mg. I rather do 6 mg but the problem is I have to interact with this irritating and troublesome doctor. (I find most doctors troublesome now. I figure they view me the same as a patient). I don’t think I have schizophrenia, but I definitely got some severe mental disorder(s) going on. Maybe Bipolar and something else. Maybe a mild form of Aspergers Syndrome going on. I’m starting to learn bipolar and substance abuse and addiction runs in my family. _PERSON_’s doesn’t run in the family, but I have poor social skills and poor friendships and stuff but overcame it when I moved away from my abusive father. It took years. I wonder if yet again Aspergers is another wrong diagnosis now like schizophrenia. I want to wait a bit until this stuff blows over with my sister a bit. I don’t think she’ll change. She’s acting stupid and pathethic again even worse and unpredictable and playing the victim and poor me card. It
s a shame and sad. She was smart growing up. Smarter than me. The problem I’m learning is I was a victim of a fake, planned, staged alien abduction at UC Berkeley via TR-3B craft back in 2011 at my home and I figured it was the military but not the normal military but a secret group linked to the Cabal, Globalists, and Illuminati according to my research. It goes deeper than that. I think there are aliens, but whether they were real, fake, implanted memories, or what I don’t know. I can’t remember and I try and push to remember and it makes me ??????? pissed off and angry. I cannot get help. I need meds to calm and relax me. I got trauma possibly tortured, drugged, possibly raped, and stuff; sometimes I think I was cloned and that time travel was involved or I’m on another planet or timeline because no one believes me and there is no evidence unless people are just evil… The kidnapping alone was traumatic enough not knowing why. I was mind-wiped. My memory and subconsciousness is taking years to re
cover and remember and part of my mental illness was all this stuff. I got a re-visit from the TR-3B crafts in 2016 at my house. (Again, people say I hallucinated them…) It’s like a giant conspiracy including this forum because I cannot get sympathy or help. I love this forum but I don’t get anyone to believe me really. I’m not going to fight to get money anymore. I’ve given up. I don’t talk to people anymore. I’m too scared. I have memories of being murdered and coming back alive too many times. I don’t got delusions but irrational and bad thoughts. I got mood problems, anxiety, substance use, and depression. I got neurological problems like dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, amensia, that bother me the most. I’ll probably never know why I was targeted. I guess a lot. Who or what group made the call?"
176187878,"Generally, if you’re wondering if you might be attracted to the same gender, the answer is yes. You come from a place and an upbringing where those feelings are really looked down upon, so it could be affecting your natural inclinations. I came from a very religious home, and I spent a long time suspecting I was different, but I didn’t realize I liked the same gender until I was maybe 23, after I had been kicked out of the church and started to question everything I knew. Prior to that, I thought I was just a really affectionate friend. It’s possible to be attracted to the same gender without realizing it. Not everyone figures it out in their teens. It doesn’t mean you have to change anything about your life, unless you want to. If you choose to date men, stay safe, because especially in your part of the world it can be dangerous to be publicly gay. But sometimes the risk is worth it, to be who you are and love who you love."

It’s just that a good deal of the women my age are either waiting to become, or are already grandmothers. My Mom even expressed her concern about my bachelorhood some time before she passed. I’ll be the first to admit that looking significantly young for my age kind of sucks. Of course, that would mean I might get away with dating a much younger woman, say maybe in her mid-20s. So, yes sometimes age isn’t anything but a number. Some people say that it’s never too late to fall in love, and therefore I might have a big fear of intimacy. I’m just venting, I guess."

176187889,"Hey, and welcome to the forum. Some of the things you described sound like they could possibly be psychosis related, but none of us are mental health professionals and cannot diagnose you. Your best bet would be to possibly talk about your experiences with family/parents/someone you trust and see about making an appointment at a mental health clinic. If you’re in the US theres some clinics that have a sliding scale, which means they determine what you pay based off of your family’s income. It could be a very little amount youd have to pay. Feel free to stick around the forum and read and ask questions if you want. Also I’m personally okay with you sharing your other experiences if you feel comfortable doing so. Wish you the best!"

174390416,"Well when I was 0-16 years old my parents really did a lot of things for me like laundry, less cooking (I always loved cooking) and paying for all my food and stuff because I always ate with them. So sometimes I think I was given bad habits but then I remember that when I was 17-20 I worked a lot, I did my laundry, I was a pretty normal kid. Until like 19 1/2 I had a bad acid trip and it really set me off. I’m sure something was wrong with me before but not so much of psychotic behavior in me. And then that summer I got fired from the job I had I ended up in the hospital not long after. Well haven’t worked much since. And honestly that’s the negative symptoms of this disease to me. Because I really think I was just a very anxious but not psychotic person before the acid trip now. And I was on a normal path like any other hard working functional kid. Maybe I was headed down a bad path a bit before the acid trip even too but once the drugs triggered sz in me I have so much lazy symptoms!!! It
s pretty cool you can work so long"
176187896,What if he gets suicidal and homicidal? When I am psychotic I don’t listen to my Dr or anyone. Its still very dangerous.
176187897,"Sorry to bug you but with what kind is symptoms specifically, if you don’t mind. My pdoc is referring me for TMS but if don’t get accepted (I prob won’t) then he wants me to consider ECT which I had about 25 yrs ago as a young teen. It was harsher back then I know it’s not so bad niw. But still hesitant. So ECT… I don’t have depression but I get stuck no activity etc and it hasn’t gotten better. And I suffer with a lot of other symptoms… I am just wondering what kinds of things it could help me with and give me relief with? _PERSON_! _AT_MENTION_"

176187902,"See? They’re just amazing! I promise, once you get the hang of it, it’s almost like not having one. I mean, you still cramp, but something great is that sometimes using a cup can shorten your period. Mine is normally 6-8 days. This last one was 4! My theory is that tampons have to sit and absorb, so it takes longer for everything to get out. For pads, ittakes longer because the flow has to travel down and gets stuck to your walls slowing it down. With a cup it’s right by your cervix so the flow doesn’t have far to travel and isn’t backed up waiting to be absorbed. Also, unless you spend more for chemical free tampons you are putting things treated with bleach and other strong chemicals in your body. Pads touch your skin down there and have the same chemicals. That skin is thin and easily absorbs stuff. Now, I am not terrified of chemicals, I know everything is made of them, but bleach and other harsh cleaning chemicals don’t belong in our bodies. Also, the amount of trash generated by p
eriods is ridonkulous."

176187907,"I say that and for once I say it without anxiety that saying that will make them come back with a vengeance. I have an awesome therapist now and in literally the span of a couple months I went from feeling like my “bond” to the demons would never be broken and I just had to accept fighting them the rest of my life to feeling freed from them. He took a completely different approach than my previous therapists. Previous therapists either saw it as delusional content and didn’t want to discuss it in depth at all, or saw it as real demons and wanted to send the demons away, by sending me to healers or priests or using crystals etc. He basically treated the demons as if they were abusers and taught me how to deal with them myself. He taught me that my hatred of them was keeping me linked to them. He taught me that my “taking the bait” and engaging with them and getting angry or fighting just gave them power. He taught me how to view the demons stoically, their voices as just another noise like 
the birds outside or people talking around me. He taught me that I am a good person, and that once I know I am a good person, there is nothing they can do to harm me. They may abuse me or try to terrorize me, but ultimately it is not corrupting me or changing me, and I am still alive and thriving. They can’t actually do anything to me. He taught me that they are incompetent, that they hold no real power. I have stopped having demonic nightmares. I have not spoken with a demon in around 2 months now. My fixation seems broken. I still think about the past, and what I’ve gone through, but I no longer obsess about what new torture they will put me through in the future. I would also like to point out that this is despite being under huge amounts of stress on a daily basis. I just feel like a changed person. summary: the demons don’t bother me anymore, have a great therapist that taught me how to overcome. I have come a long way."

176187911,"Yes, it’s a pain to take AP’s, but it all boils down to choosing the lesser of two evils. If I didn’t take AP’s my life would be a lot worse. Ofcourse it helps to find a AP that you are comfortable with. I have been on the same one for many years, there are side effects like drowsiness and lack of libido, but I just accept it. All AP’s have side effects. The one I am on at least doesen’t cause me any serious side effects for the time being. I’m happy with that."
176187912,Im on haloperidol and heard aome guys talking at a hospital that this medication is banned in most countries. Is this true?
174390421,"_AT_MENTION_ So glad to have you here! I hope you receive the support you are looking for! What you went through four years ago is traumatic. I’m sorry your experienced that. The hospital has its place, but it can be overwhelming. Also, taking an antipsychotic (until you find a better one) can cause you much distress because of the side effects. It’s fairly common that your symptoms stopped after your first episode. It’s also common, as you’re saying, that symptoms come back or new symptoms start. That can mean that there is an underlying illness. You may or may not have schizophrenia. A psychiatrist will determine that after observing you and collecting data about your symptoms and experiences over time. Diagnoses can change, especially in the beginning, if symptoms are sporadic. If symptoms progress in amount, frequency, or intensity, a doctor will confidently give you a more clear diagnosis. The three symptoms you are describing, fear of being followed, fear of being controlled, and fear 
of everyone thinking a certain way of you, are symptoms of psychosis. It sounds like you are having an episode. Having an episode does not necessarily mean you have to go to the hospital. It can be treated with medicine and intervention. The kind folks on here will respond to your post and tell you to call your doctor immediately. You can lose insight, and it’s besf to receive treatment before that happens. If you lose insight, you also could lose control. For your safety and the safety of those around you, you would need to go to the hospital. Write down all of the symptoms you are having. As best as you can, track their frequency and intensity. Find a doctor ASAP. When you call to make an appointment, explain that you are having a psychotic episode and you need to be seen immediately. If you can not get in to see a psychiatrist, visit your regular family doctor. Research hospitals. They aren’t all terrible. It’s best to find a stand alone behavioral health hospital, if you can. Continue to talk with u
s on this forum. The people here are wonderful. Most lead happy, productive lives. Their wisdom is incredible, and they will talk you through. Have you told your family? Why is your insurance switching?"

Mixed opinions lies about gulkand in internet as its widely used in many food items and also in tobacco and other products. Paan paraag chewing is linked to mouth cancers and its worse than smoking. Gulkand taste lingers in mouth for about two days or more and such a thing resembles close to paan like chewing which might turn to cancer in some and for some it might be perfectly fine.

I went to see my pdoc and told her what happened. She said it was my ego which took a blow. So she upped my Abilify and within a few days I was ok.

176187964,"I doubt that. Labeling symptoms as psychotic hardly elucidates anything. It is not as if people on both sides of the diagnosis are puzzled about these symptoms and then someone mentions ‘maybe it is psychosis’ upon which either or both sides sigh in relief, finally knowing what’s going on. Sure, it can help when first confronted with these symptoms, but the experiences last."

Having been hospitalized and luckily not getting assault on an officer charges. 2 weeks of a rather nice facility I guess or at least the people were extremely nice. The decision was 30 mg of abilify and moving into the hyperdermic form. Just wondering if anyone else experieces anxiety/restlessness. Feels like I want to jump out of my skin but cant focus entirely on what I am trying to do to occupy my time. Opinions would be nice and hello again everyone.
176187979,Thank you for your answer! Do you have thoughts crossing your mind sometimes or is it blank? I think it’s about the treatment I will ask my psychiatrist
176187980,Yeah. _NAME_.
176187981,It is true and it’s unfortunate so much _USER_ID_ around particularly around mi.
176187982,This is good news. They used 2 different dosages. I am hoping they produce a 2nd dose of 28 mg besides the current 42 mg. Saw one online bipolar patient review of Caplyta that was very positive.
176187983,It’ll be machines. We need the technology to be beyond us so maybe some cybernetics. I think pretty soon we’ll get so some of the modern cybernetic devices for some folk. My guess is next 20 years. So. There’s two things. One. The human brain is pretty complex and that takes a lot of understanding. And two. We will probably destroy all our society and history before this happens.
176187984,"I regularly tell people i have had psychosis. Am far from secretive about it. But i wouldnt wear a shirt. I want to choose to either tell or not tell, and how, when, etc. I feel a shirt might make them change their mind about me (she is crazy, scary) whilst telling people carefully might make them change their prejudice (ah…apparently someone can have sz and not be like a character in a scary movie)."

176187989,"could be rebound anxiety. it takes like minimum 10 days of klonopin use to get any kind of withdrawal. even if you take it every two or three days it could still be in your system. klonopin has a long half life i wouldnt take it more than once a week at most. im a super slow metabolizer so it took me two weeks to get bad withdrawal, but the mental effects of the withdrawal lasted over a year and I was more unstable than I was during psychosis. i took it twice a week with one week where i took it everyday or every other day then once the withdrawal start it i took it everyday for a little over a week thinking it would fix it. most people dont have a problem with it but i became dependent without even knowing how much damage that can do and now id never take a benzo again. It was weird because I didn’t even think it was that effective and was not addicted but just took it to help the tardive dyskinesia (its one of the few meds that helps it) and anxiety"

176187991,"I know i have loads of anger, fear, sadness about my treatment in psychiatry, or the lack thereof. They just watched me and my family go to ruins and did nothing at all to help, while we begged for them to do something. Im so angry about it. The other trauma’s in my life, like childhood sexual abuse or adult abuse, arent as bad. I think of them much less. I have (almost) forgiven. But this just keeps coming up, every time something reminds me. What to do about it? I dont want to spend my days angry at some stupid psychiatrists who have long forgotten me. That seems like a rather worthless way to spend my days. I do loads of other things btw…I work and do fun things and social stuff and dance and go for drinks and all. But i want the angry piece of me to be gone, that comes up when im confronted with this."
176187992,My bond with mother has to do with my own memories. Part of our poor relationship had to do with my being negative which was totally my own fault. I think I get negative because that way I can feel some sense of power.

My husband always cut his own son down which I never understood. Jealousy? But I found out the only reason he wanted the divorce was to get my Social Security Since I want to wait until 65 to get more. He never could wait and I spent $50,000 paying off his credit card bills that he kept it a secret post office box and I thought we could be happy, Debt free, Retired and maybe travel.

That was kind of a catch-all label for many different mental illnesses in those days. In fact when I first got sick myself, a couple doctors called it a nervous breakdown. We had a family friend when I was young who later became schizophrenic. Before he got sick he was a cool, mellow, hippie who drove around the country in his station wagon and he would stop by and visit us every now and then and stay for a week or two. He got married when he was about 23, and him and his hippie wife had a baby. He couldn’t settle down so the marriage didn’t work and then things started getting weird. He stole a car, which was totally out of character for him and he got arrested. Other weird things happened, and while this was going on I was becoming schizophrenic myself which is kinda weird too. My parents found out all this from his parents and they ca
me over to our apartment to discuss the situation with him and I remember he just looked so different. Subdued with a haunted look in his eye, and very quiet. He ended up going up to Washington State to bum around and then the next thing we know we get a letter from his parents saying he died. It was winter time and someone found his body, leaning against a tree in an orchard, dead. He liked to go to any orchard wherever he went and pick walnuts or apples or anything else and he must have got tired and laid down to rest and froze to death. It was very tragic, we knew him for a long time and he was the nicest guy. It was all very sad."

174390456,"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0706-z This is a study on pomaglumetad and a new-to-me drug called TS-134. The authors suggest that the reason for the failure of POMA in large trials could be that the tested dose was too low. The dose tested which showed efficacy on symptoms in this study was 320 mg vs 80mg in the _NAME_ study. Higher doses had to be titrated up though, due to nausea and vomiting. This study was on healthy volunteers given ketamine and then given a brain scan to determine target engagement, and assessment of psychiatric symptoms (using BPRS). High-dose POMA significantly reduced ketamine-induced BPRS total symptoms within and between-groups ( p < 0.01, d = ?0.41; p = 0.04, d = ?0.44, respectively), but neither POMA dose significantly suppressed ketamine-induced dACC pharmacoBOLD. In contrast, low-dose TS-134 led to moderate to large within and between group reductions in both BPRS positive symptoms ( p = 0.02, d = ?0.36; p = 0.008, d = ?0.82, respectively) and dACC pharm
acoBOLD ( p = 0.004, d = ?0.56; p = 0.079, d = ?0.50, respectively) using pooled across-study placebo data. High-dose POMA exerted significant effects on clinical symptoms, but not on target engagement, suggesting a higher dose may yet be needed, while the low dose of TS-134 showed evidence of symptom reduction and target engagement. These results support further investigation of mGluR2/3 and other glutamate-targeted treatments for schizophrenia."

176188109,"I live in supported living and have a social service care package. I get 21 hours a week one to one support and access to 55 shared hours a week between 3 other people with Intellectual disabilities/Autism. I have been on holiday to Germany in 2015 for 5 days with my support staff, back then the support company charged service users for 8 hours a day for their support which made it affordable to go on holiday. Now the care company charges for the full day (15 hours) at £15.00 a hour and a sleep at £75.00 = £300 a day staff support costs basically - (staff only get paid minimum wage though) I would like to travel to India for 3 weeks to visit religious sites for blessings and healing - but am unable to travel on my own without support staff. In support costs alone would be over £6.000 for 3 weeks - 2 weeks is £4.000 and 1 week is £2.000 and their is not point going just for one week! This isn’t counting expenditure for flights and accommodation, domestic flight within India…etc Which would 
be double as I’ll be paying for two people… Flights to Mumbai for 2 people in November are £1.300 alone… About a 2 years ago we had a staff member leave the support company, he retired, lives on his own, likes to travel to Thailand frequently, we often talked about different countries and his holidays. He was a good support worker. He had to be DBS criminal records checked to work at the support company. If I offered him say £1.000 salary for the 3 weeks to travel to India with me and paid for accommodation and flights, all expenditure… Maybe working 30 hours a week with me, I would be flexible with the hours, also doing tourist things after I’ve cleansed my soul - he might say yes? I haven’t asked him, I would have to put it to social services first… I think its the best possible way for me to go to India… The only sag is he worked here when I seriously harmed myself cutting the microchip out my left armpit and he’s seem me sectioned multiple times, sometimes forcibly. Also delusions have 
been around ritualistic sacrificing myself to _PERSON_. That might put if off although I’ve been stable for nearly 3 years… Also I think he’s don’t know about the _PERSON_ part? Hopefully! Do you think that sounds like a good idea, if this fails do you think if I advertised on support sites for a support worker to accompany me would be a good idea? How would I do this? Sorry for rambling…"
174390478,but what about people around me.how can i live in a society and be comfortable with my surroundings if people think im crazy.
176188110,its like its a loop that happens first i hear them approach sometimes saying good things then they start to change to saying bad things then they call me a demon and tell me im going to hell. Then i curse out god for sending me to hell. And then its silent for a while again and starts all over. Im just gonna think its a mental illness and not believe that the voices are real. Its just so ridiculous i hate this crap…

176188114,I eat 3 meals a day. Breakfast is just a large orange though. It may not sound like much but my lunch and dinner is pretty liberal. In terms of portion size. If I don’t lose weight on my current portion sizes I will consider reducing the portion size.

176188116,"I think the hate against Chinese people is partly due to how the government is basically to blame for the virus appearing and for it spreading. They have very unsanitary conditions when it comes to food production and the government actively suppresses accurate information about new diseases, making it difficult for other countries to adapt to the problems created by this unsanitariness. This virus was preventable and could even have been stopped if the Chinese government had been a more moral government. But it is rotten to the core. That said, hating Chinese people for the problems created by their ruling elite is completely irrational."

176188124,"Hi all, Going through a period of withdrawing from socializing at the moment. It’s been a little bit of a struggle here and there out in the world, but I’ve been forcing myself to be social with coworkers and customers. At home, all I want to do is be by myself though. I haven’t really been active on the forum as a result. Before meds and SZ, I would get like this, although it hasn’t happened for a very long time. I recently stopped taking 50 mg of Zoloft and was only taking 15 mg of Abilify on days that I worked. This lasted for about a month and a half, until the weird thoughts and symptoms started creeping back in. Back on meds for like the past 5 days, and am feeling a bit off at the moment. Just would like to know if anyone else goes through times where they kinda withdraw from socializing and how to break out of this funk. Thanks!"

176188132,The food and art therapy were the only good things about my hospital stay.
176188133,Yes that would be great! A half year fitness would be…240 euros…then some books. That would be nice. Or fitness and some social skills or assertiveness course. My boss says a sports class would be okay for him. _PERSON_.
174390479,"I should clarify, I’m still on an antipsychotic. In the past, I haven’t done well with no meds at all. I am still on Rexulti, Wellbutrin, and an antianxiety med. I spoke to her about it because 2 antipsychotics were giving me a world of side effects. And of the two, Abilify gives me horrible shakes. I’m just happy it’s going well so far. I’ve had massive withdrawal in the past with meds, and this is going better than I expected."

Even basic interaction or tasks wore me out. I didn’t shower, I didn’t clean, I barely talked to anyone.

176188245,I still have 450 euros to spend from my job. I can spend it on things that improve my career. F.e. a course or book or conference. But today i heard i can probably also spend it on something like a year entrance to a fitness club or so…things that improve my wellbeing. I need to spend it before 31 dec and make a good argumentation on why it improves my work functioning. What would you spend it on?
174390501,Stopping clozapine nearly killed me. I had a severe relapse and landed up in hospital. On risperidone I got much better though. It’s a good med. I’m on amisulpride now which is excellent too. If I stop my meds I get relapse within a week. I also struggle with denial of my illness. This itself is part of the illness - when one doesn’t comprehend one is ill.
176188246,"If your panic attacks are predictable and infrequent, it is not a bad treatment assuming you also only use the benzos irregularly. If your anxiety is unpredictable, frequent or you use the benzos every day, it is really just a drug addiction with zero net anxiety treatment effect. The tolerance to benzos is complete with regular use and results in just as much increased anxiety as decreased anxiety (ignoring any placebo effects)."

176188260,Someone is paying a lot of money to keep you hospitalized because they think you are worth it. I spent about 20 months in hospitals. I didn’t see it was doing any good for me. But here I am 40 plus years later.

I made it through the probation period (3 months) but was let go due to low performance."

174390528,"Well, then maybe your doctor would write a letter saying you’re so disabled still that you can not work a full time job. After all, schizophrenia does not just go away. Even if you work, the disease is still there and it’s possible that Social Security might think it’s great that you can even work part-time. Social Security has strict rules but it ain’t our enemy. The judges and workers there have dealt with other people with disabling schizophrenia and they may not understand it or know a lot about it but they probably understand enough to know that most people with schizophrenia are not able to work and that even working part-time with it is extremely difficult. I’ve been on it since about 1983. I’ve worked almost steadily since 1984. I’ve worked full-time sometimes but mostly part-time. I’ve been through all those work trial periods and all the reviews. They have always understood that I can not work enough to support myself. I’ve had full time jobs before and I’ve tried goin
g of disability a few times to make it on my own but it always ended up badly, so i got back on it and here I am, still on it. Social Security has my all employment records since I got my first job at age 17, they’ve seen my medical chart with my medical history, they have a record of every cent I’ve ever received from them. By their rules at my last review, the worker told me I can earn up to about a $1000 a month and still collect SSDI for the rest of my life. I’m not cheating or scamming them or trying to get away with something. Like I said, they have all my records and I qualify by their rules. If your doctor can back you up that working full time would not be possible for you then Social Security should accept that."
176188288,I folded my laundry that helped for a little while
176188289,"i feel like i am stable enough with psychosis that if i can get the depression more under control i think i should look for another job. theres a problem though, i cant resist the urge to lay down many times a day and am not very active throughout the day, weight is a problem too but mostly the being tired all the time is more disabling. caffeine doesnt help i sometimes feel even more tired after consuming it"
176188290,"I have TD, so I’m sure my twitches make me stick out a bit. Also my size, I’m tall and a little overweight. But other than that I think I’m pretty neutral. At least until I get my hands on some hairdye again"

176188297,I don’t feel that i deserve anything special because i have hardship. Plenty of people have hardships and many of them are worse off than me. I’m just thankful that i have what i need every day.
176188298,That makes sense thank you
176188299,"I really relate to _AT_MENTION_ . My trigger warning for psychosis lately is thinking that there is a greater cause going on. I watch snl to find “clues” on what’s going on, I grow serious and concerned over things I have no control over, and my own personal life suffers. I get this righteous feeling like society is being changed and I need to help… it makes me really sad. I have insight these days and when I start to feel like there’s big things going on, I know something is wrong. I really enjoy being sane. Having psychosis damages my brain over time and every time I get psychosis I end up lower functioning. I feel myself slowly declining as the psychosis wears on. It’s terribly scary."
176188300,I learned in psychology courses that first there is a genetic predisposition and then there is an environmental trigger. For me the trigger was weed. I had my first psychosis when smoking weed at 18 y.o. Its legal here. My friend said I was abnormal and told me sorry if weed made you like that. My friend was normal when smoking weed with me so I knew I had a genetic predisposition. I was hearing voices since I was 16.
176188301,"I like that thought. I’ve never thought of it that way! Thanks, _AT_MENTION_"
176188302,Oh _AT_MENTION_ I’m so sorry. I wish for comfort for you in this time of despair.

176188318,"People with schizoid personality disorder, who usually prefer to be alone and have few if any friends, do not seem to suffer much because of this. I don’t think social isolation on its own is harmful to mental health. For some it’s just who they are and how they prefer to live."
176188319,"Sounds like a good time to connect with yourself, get a new movie, a book, a binge worthy show, something to keep yourself entertained. A fine dinner of your favorite foods. Even a bath and an early night if you wanted. It’s you time! I’ve a feeling your used to taking care of others, I can see how only looking after yourself would would feel.

176188325,My son just got diagnosed and Drs said this med supposedly right now has fewer side effects but all I’m reading are bad experiences.
176188326,I do telephone appointments with my nurse. And video appointments with my pdoc. I go to the local health centre for my depot. This is cool because it means no one is bringing cooties into my house

176188330,"It worked for a while. I took a lot of supplements. They stopped working for a while. Nothing has cured anything, but they made me feel better and reduced the negs somewhat. Sometimes, it was just temporary. I think I actually have positive, permanent brain changes from sarcosine and other supplements."

176188336,The only acceptable sweetener is Stevia. The others are bad for your health. Not only are they a cancer risk but they affect your moods in a negative way.
176188337,"Thoughtful n sweet of you but you are entitled to go and could have a bit extra perhaps if you do. I recently got vegan ready meals from a local church organisation. It cost just $10 for two portions and $10 delivery. I got vegan bolognese , vegan lasagne and vegan korma. There is also a pantry I have been to but not been there in almost two months. I also thought I can afford to buy at the normal shop. At the pantry you give $5 and get a bag of food . Even though I can afford the normal shop it’s helpful to go to the pantry. Maybe I should start going again. I’m loving the ready meals. Hope they stay open and that it’s not just temporary because of covid19. I understand as I have thought the same as you but I think I will go back to the pantry soon."

176188345,???? that. ???? filters. And ?_USER_ID_????? Peace! I’m out!
176188346,Yes they can. I honestly think that my psychiatrist intentionally gave me a bipolar disorder diagnosis for the same reasons. Also because it’s less stigmatizing then a schizoaffective diagnosis.

176188359,I’ve been working there for the last year.
176188360,I think it’s more that Risperdal takes emotions and motivation away for some people.
176188361,Kids are awesome. My lunch hour walks take me past a couple of elementary schools. If the playgrounds are full I stick my tongue out at them and tell me they prolly can’t hit me with a snowball (the walking path is just on the other side of the fence). About 40 snowballs later we’ve established their aim is pretty good! Fun for all.
176188362,So it came out in 1985. I was 9
176188363,"Well, yeah, and I didn’t understand it exactly. It wasn’t what I had been taught."
176188364,"That’s for starters. If you’re not feeling bad enough to call the hotline, then I’d suggest being around family / friends until the feelings blow over. You could also try picking up an easy hobby like some high-rated casual game and sinking time into that. If the feelings stick around through all that, it could be time to seek medical help. The cheapest anti-depressant, I find, is a B-complex, since low B-vitamins are tied to depression, and dosing that can make a difference in mood fairly quickly."

It was significant with 10 and 25 mg, with a slightly less improvement for 25 mg. The difference was not noticeable in the PANSS (note that most of the items of PANSS are for positive and negative symptoms, less for cognitive), but they conjecture that this is because of only 12 weeks treatment. The phase 3 study will last 26 weeks. My psychiatrist estimates that the trial will start in late summer for me."

I gather its not widely used because 70% of schizophrenics dont think they have the illness so they wont take it properly which can lead to complications including worsening psychosis.

After taking my low dose of it I felt like I had one of those shots they give in psych wards to calm down patients that are currently a harm to others. Btw I know the vidéo you’re talking about.

GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News – 5 Oct 20 Concentrating and Releasing Drugs in the Brain with Pinpoint Accuracy Scientists at ETH Zurich say they have developed a technique for concentrating and releasing drugs in the brain with much accuracy.

Scientists at ETH Zurich say they have developed a technique for concentrating and releasing drugs in the brain with much accuracy. This could make it possible in the future to deliver psychiatric and cancer drugs and other medications only to those regions of the brain where this is medically desirable, according to the team. “Non-invasive, molecularly-specific, focal modulation of brain circuits with low off-target effects can lead to breakthroughs in treatments of brain disorders. We systemically inject engineered ultrasound-controllable drug carriers and subsequently apply a 
novel two-component Aggregation and Uncaging Focused Ultrasound Sequence (AU-FUS) at the desired targets inside the brain,” write the investigators. The researchers report that they have demonstrated the effectiveness of the new method in experiments on rats. First, they encapsulated a neuro-?inhibitory drug in the drug carriers. Then, using the new technique, they successfully blocked a specific neural network connecting two areas of the brain. The scientists were able to show in the experiments that only this one particular part of the neuronal network was blocked and that the drug did not act on the entire brain. The scientists are currently testing the effectiveness of their method in animal models of mental illness, for example to reduce anxiety, of neurological disorders and to target lethal brain tumors that are surgically inaccessible. Once its effectiveness and advantages have been confirmed in animals will researchers be able to advance application of the method to alleviate suffering in humans."

176188390,"I get it. Delusions can be a form of escapism and self-protection against the world. It’s not a healthy coping skill, but until I learned others, it was hard to let go of it. It was like, “hey, it’s not my fault my life is garbage. I have to live like this to protect everyone else.” It takes the pressure off yourself and your own responsibility for your actions, and puts it on forces outside your control. Eventually, through lots of therapy, I started to get my life to a place I was happy with. Then, I didn’t miss the excitement of the delusional world, because the real world wasn’t so bad. It takes a lot of work, but it’s worth it."

174390539,"I bring this up because I’m pretty sure I was either born with something like this ( or MCDD) and experimented on or given it through genetic engineering by aliens. I’m very psychic in some ways too and a former time traveler. I also know for a fact we live in a computer simulation. Not sure why or how I have these abilities/gifts. My English is not the best anymore since the cognitive decline from the schizophrenia nor my math/analytical skills. But I believe I was the first to believe and figure out we lived in a simulation. I think that’s why I was targeted so heavily and because I was a REAL time traveler. Sure, I had a lot of help and enhancements over the lives I’ve lived. Also, hurt and tortured a lot. I was killed even for my beliefs, I guess. (I keep coming back alive via a time loop around 2011 – the moment I had my bad drug trip – from an unknown time in the future via consciousness transfer) I got paranoia, schizotypal features, and mild autism. I also had depression when th
e weather is bad/sucks. My brain declined then too. I got stressed in college really easily and since then have had extremely bad stress. I almost became autistic it was so bad. That and I appeared paranoid. I don’t think I’m delusional at all. Maybe I’m scared to be believed and perhaps even faking that I even have delusions. I sound delusional but I am not. Look at _PERSON_ and other famous, rich, and smart people. They think we live in a simulation too. I may not be famous or rich, but I did have some ET visits and even got out of the simulation because of it. Musk hasn’t. Anyways, schizotypal autism is one of the thoughts or beliefs I have that may or may not be true/real. I feel a little narcissistic and grandiose. I definitely ran the simulation with help and even was told I was the second smartest person on the planet at one time by aliens. When I was a kid, I had more schizotypal and behavior issues than autism. Then in college, the aspergers or lack of social skills became very apparent and t
hen the paranoid and psychosis much later on came about. Back in 2011, I posted that we lived in a computer simulation run by God (now it’s either aliens or God) and _NAME_’s paper was barely even heard of or mentioned. It would probably have never come up in history if it wasn’t for me. I think I’m a genius because of simulation theory. I was abducted by aliens several times because of it. They definitely don’t want us knowing about it. I think there is computer code or psychology preventing people from figuring it out. I can help if need be. Don’t know how though. My thoughts and beliefs are being suppressed on the internet. Initially, I had _PERSON_ but over the lives I’ve had, it morphed into paranoid psychosis. The aliens hurt me pretty bad before. They also sometimes help. I guess there are good ones and bad ones. It’s all about controlling the people, including me. They’re messing with my soul/consciousness really bad. The whole _NAME_ story makes me think I ?????? up my life a trilli
on or a billion lifetimes ago by posting that crap online. Not sure why it’s still up there. Maybe I discovered aliens along the way with that story. I think I did. There are powerful people and groups that really run and control this planet. Money and social skills (networking) make the world go round. I think there is more good than evil on this planet though. I tried saving the planet several times before, but I think I should have just minded my own business and shut up. Not sure how I remember all this stuff. I think energy drinks are enhancing the mind uploading and quantum physics aspects of my consciousness aka psychosis. I’ve been outside the simulation before a few times out of billions and it wasn’t pretty. I sometimes think I’m in hell. God (super advanced AI possibly) put us in a simulation to protect us. That is all. Thank You. Have a nice day."

176188400,"Yes, that would be the easiest and simple explanation. But I’m convinced I’m really in a time loop. I don’t identify nor am I _NAME_ anymore. Nor do I think he’s still alive, but maybe in a fragment of my memory from a distant past life. Maybe a piece of him still latches on. I can tell you I was brainwashed and forced to watch the TV of the end of the world many times in the future – unknown year. Is that a delusion? I’m trying to get help here… Basically, there was a war (you can guess what kind – I will not say or go into details) but it seemed to always happen – but I have faith it won’t because God is protecting us in this simulation. What people call New World Order was actually just depopulation to keep the people under control. I hope I don’t upset people, but that’s what happened to me over 100 times in my past lives. I’m traumatized still. I believe in freedom of speech, I’m a proud American, a good person, and I love God. Under control from what? I don’t kno
w. Civil War or simulation theory. I don’t remember or recall. I hope it won’t happen again. It won’t. I think this timeline is positive and great and I love my country. I don’t identify as a time traveler anymore because it’s just reincarnation for me. That and I’m not psychic either. Maybe it happened on another planet? I was told I was on the wrong planet before. That and my mom said she wished I wasn’t born because they found out I was _NAME_ in a past life. I suffered. My mom said she would never say such things, but I have photographic recall because of mind uploading. It was a different quantum universe with different outcomes, albeit very similar. The guy on TV said the people who controlled us in the future prefer tradition. I think conservative values. That and we had visitors from a parallel universe. Aliens? I don’t know. Anyways, the _NAME_ story is irrelevant and rubbish. I hope we all have peace and prosperity. I hope I’m wrong."
176188401,I don’t hear voices or have delusions right now though

176188406,Idk if this is the same but I have this thing if my gut gets scared of someone I try to find a reason why they r not perfect so that I don’t feel so scared. I try to also be more careful to try and trust in people’s goodness too so that I don’t feel so scared. Just to give that trust a chance otherwise I’m just living in fear.
174390542,I lost hope when I first recovered…please continue your meds and don’t think you can stop taking them first of firsts…keep in touch with your psychiatrist and see what he or she can do for your lack of interest…med changes will probably occur to find what really works for you…good luck…and welcome to the forum.
176188407,"My symptoms are mild, probably non existent. As for my unusual beliefs they are just exaggerated versions of what many normies think. Any of you finds him/herself in a similar position?"
176188408,When psychotic I see a blue and a black orb (sphere). The blue orb has white eyes and says positive things about me and the black orb has red eyes and tells me to do negative things. (Mostly hurt myself). Usually I see the blue thing during the day and the black thing at night. (This my be sundowning as my therapist suggested). But this is only when I’ve been off my medicine for several months. I started seeing and hearing these when I was eight.

Communicating more efficiently (to my mind) than others is not an impairment. Having no interest in wasting ones time on frivolities is not an impairment (for me). Why do we have to worry about classifying things as disabilities, why can’t we just say, “hey, this is how they roll.” You can be different without being disabled."

I’ll wait and see what surprises or disappointments the next chapter in my life has for me in terms of health and career. My doctor suggested I go on bupropion and see if it will help my energy level go higher specially during the winter months. He also agreed to decrease the dose of my monthly invega injection to 75mgs since my energy is way too low. Has anyone here taken or is taking buproprion?

Anyway, yeah, the conversion happens to some szs he said… _AT_MENTION_, well i guess we should be patient on this and give ourselves more courage. If you can occupy with something, when this happens to you, maybe its the best way to forget about it ."

176188455,"Mobbing has been quite widely analysed in employees’ relations by various authors from different countries. However, the mobbing prevention issue, with the aim of improving the level of management culture in a social organisation, is rarely discussed. Usually, a social organisation is interested and obliged to take particular care of the employees’ wellbeing, with respect to the fact that employees with certain disabilities are working in the organisation. The employees’ health and safety policy implemented by these organizations includes the following aspects: constant provision of information, instruction, supervision with a view to employees’ safety; introduction of systems that allow to implement a quick and effective communication with employees of the company on health and safety issues; the continuously functioning system of identification of the threats to employees, decision-making and feedback. However, most of the means are oriented towards workplace adjustment and employees’ p
hysical wellbeing. In addition, it is necessary to take into account that the relationship of healthy people and people with disabilities working together is affected by explicit and implicit provisions unfavourable to the disabled people. Thus, the issues of managerial staff competencies when organising work processes, maintaining healthy employee interrelations and a positive psychological microclimate are relevant. The research problem is the question of what employee interrelations disturb the activities of the organisation and, after such disturbances are diagnosed, how to improve the management level in an organisation by using prevention means. The abundance of research on mobbing in relations between employees shows the lack and/or ineffective application of preventive measures of the problem. This is also confirmed by _PERSON_ (2014) arguing that there is a paucity of research into effective prevention and intervention programmes. Preventive measures that focus on the whole workplace culture or on ta
rgets alone have mixed results. According to the author, workplace policies and procedures may lessen the prevalence and incidence of bullying, but often competing interests of senior management, human resources personnel, supervisors and workers may mitigate any anti-bullying interventions. Branch, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ (2013) note the fact that the solution of theoretically raised problems of mobbing remains a not fully resolved problem in practice. Based on _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ (2010), it can be argued that the key for mobbing prevention is raising awareness among employees and also in the whole society. The experience of researchers, both directly and indirectly presenting solutions for prevention of mobbing in relations between employees, is indisputable in this area (Arenas, León-Pérez, Munduate, & Medina, 2015; Gillespie, Gates, & Fisher, 2015; _PERSON_, 2014; _PERSON_, 2010; Ovejero, Yubero, & Moral, 2011; Psunder, 2011; _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, & _PERSON_, 2013; 
_PERSON_, Caughlin, Gazica, Truxillo, & Spector, 2014; etc.). However, the persons responsible for the implementation of decisions are not always able to effectively apply them in practice (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, & _PERSON_?ay, 2015). Undoubtedly, not all preventive measures are suitable for absolutely all organisations and all individuals without exception. For example, results of research made by _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _NAME_ (2013) demonstrate the importance of considering individual differences as predictors of bullying and, in particular, it suggests that mental health promotion might play a role in bullying prevention. The authors state that, in addition, findings indicate that organisational interventions for workplace bullying may benefit from introducing elements aimed at improving group cohesion and organisational climate. According to _PERSON_ and Hunter (2013) effective action against bullying involves more than policy-making, rule forming and guideline setting. Accordi
ng to the author, it is important to cultivate the resilience of those at the sharp end of anti-bullying projects, and engage with managers and employees who experience difficulties or confront unpalatable changes to their work situation as anti-bullying initiatives develop. Hutchinson’s (2012) research concludes by suggesting that a multidisciplinary approach to understanding workplace bullying as a work and employment relations issue is a fundamental step in its prevention. According to _PERSON_ et al. (2011) prevention can be carried out only through effective information and training of workers and employers, who have the legal obligation to preserve the integrity of the mental and physical status of their employees and colleagues during work. _PERSON_ and _NAME_ (2011), after analysing risk factors for workplace violence in clinical registered nurses, state that for violence prevention, interventions should be sensitive to personal factors. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_’s (2009) research data seem 
to confirm that mobbing prevention can be implemented starting from the psychosocial work environment and management of relationships, especially involving leaders and colleagues. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ (2007) also maintain that prevention against occupational mobbing must be given high attention. _NAME_ & _NAME_ Management culture and mobbing in a social organisation: whether a special...

174390587,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you’re having a hard time, and that your family isn’t more supportive of you wanting to eat healthier. I don’t know what to even suggest to help you. Do you have any of your own income so you could buy your own food, or at least your own healthy snacks, and keep it in your room instead of putting it where other people could eat it? _AT_MENTION_ I feel your pain. I gained 50 pounds on Abilify before I went off it. I just kept overeating and I was hungry all the time. But, I think if I had been eating healthy like I am now on Zyprexa, I probably wouldn’t have gained weight. Abilify just plain stimulated my appetite! Zyprexa doesn’t do that to me. I hope the Abilify works out for you, it was good to me with regard to positive symptoms! You are doing so well with your weight loss, doing it right and losing slowly. I’m sure you will get back on track! _AT_MENTION_ Good luck! I don’t think I could fast for even one day! _AT_MENTION_ I have to meticulously control wh
at I put in my mouth so I don’t gain on Zyprexa. If you don’t want to make a big effort, maybe just try filling up on raw veggies. Right now I am eating a bowl of 2 cups cauliflower florets, 2 baby cucumbers with peels, and 8 grape tomatoes. I am almost full with only 84 calories (I log my food on a nutrition tracker, so that’s why I know how many calories I’m eating). I will now be able to eat a sensible dinner without overdoing it. You can at least do things like that to make a partial effort. I gained about 50 pounds when I was on Zyprexa in 1996-97, but I have lost 28 pounds so far this time.

176188567,"Does anyone here have reoccurring delusions? By that I mean delusions that have completely gone away for years at a time and then suddenly they return? I ask mostly to see if that could be a common thing. I’ll try to be brief. About 11 years ago I had the delusion that yelling at the top of my lungs could “influence” certain natural phenomena. It left me feeling very depressed for several years. I’ll give an example and explain why. Well, sometime maybe around 2008 or 2009, I yelled at the top of my lungs for no real reason. Sometimes I’d done so to vent. It was a quiet night in a small town. Anyway some.months later there were a number of different natural disasters. There are natural disasters every year but these years were significantly worse than the last 5 or so years. Well, because of the death toll I grew depressed and began heavily smoking cigarettes. Anyway, since then I’ve yelled a few times here and there throughout the years. For the last 5 years I yelled maybe once. In my 
delusions about it, I had imagined that different words caused different things in different locations depending on where the yell originated as well. I’m not necessarily saying I caused them anymore, at this point I feel I may have intensified them. Except once that I felt I caused a big chunk of ice to fall off a glacier with reverberations. That caused a huge flood over the course of a couple of months. In my mind at least. The idea that sticks in my mind is the expression, “Even the flap of a butterfly’s wings can cause a tsunami.” It is commonly used in when discussing the early ideas that brought on the chaos and string theory. Anyway, for several years I’d gotten completely rid of this delusion. I just looked up the worst natural disasters for every year and compared them. It was very to see that I yelled during some of the worse years. The most destructive word I’d yelled seemed to be ""Gohan!’ While the word ?????!” Did seem to have an effect. It’s super silly I know. And yes, this 
delusion began before the popular video game “Skyrim” was released heh. So now to shake the delusion, I’m thinking about yelling something at the top of my lungs from a place that definitely has an echo. At the same time, I’m slightly worried a massive natural disasters would occur overseas within the next 1 to 4 months. I’ve never really felt it was an immediate disaster but more like a snowball causing an avalanche thing. However it has happened sooner before. I say overseas because part of my delusion involves another person who can do the same but to North and South America. So any thoughts? Should I try it to get rid of the delusion? Or just forget about and hope it goes away? My thoughts are it would affect somewhere in the east of the Pacific ocean because I am on the west coast. Or would it be west in that case? I mean basically near South East Asia. Though since I’ve been in San _NAME_ it seems to affect Chinese provinces more probably due to location. Oh and what direction matters too. M

""About the film The Miami-Dade Criminal Mental Health Project (CMHP) comes to life in this documentary, following a team of dedicated public servants working through the courts to steer people with mental illness — as their court cases hang in the balance — on a path from incarceration to recovery. An exploration of the Miami-Dade Criminal Mental Health Project (CMHP) — a novel approach to solving the mental health crisis that could be a model for America. Shocked by how people with mental illness were treated in Miami-Dade’s jails, Judge _NAME_ works with a team of dedicated public servants, as well as former adversaries 
in the criminal justice system, to help people with mental illness navigate from lives of tragedy to possibility. The documentary follows a diverse group of people committed to the common goal of helping people with mental illness who enter through the courthouse doors. The film reveals a humane criminal justice approach to mental illness that is orchestrated from the court outwards into the community. From court dates to group therapy, the film follows Miami’s community-based experiment to solving the mental health crisis, where incarceration becomes the last resort and everyone from the police to prosecutors works together to support the notion that “recovery is possible.”"""
176188571,"Sep 363856 it is thought to be an agonist of TAAR1 en.wikipedia.org SEP-363856 | Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of SEP-363856 in the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear. However, it is thought to be an agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially dopamine receptor D2). Thyroid hormones are a natural agonist of TAAR1 en.wikipedia.org TAAR1 | Thyronamines Thyronamines are molecular derivatives of the thyroid hormone and are very important for endocrine system function. 3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is the most potent TAAR1 agonist yet discovered, although it lacks monoamine transporter affinity and therefore has little effect in monoamine neurons of the central nervous system. Activation of TAAR1 by T1AM results in the production of large amounts of cAMP. This effect is coupled with decreased body temperature a
nd cardiac output. So the moral of the story is to check your thyroid out. I know I have a bum thyroid. Does anyone else have a bum thyroid?!"

174390601,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Stem Cells for improving the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Stem cells and development, Feb 2020 01 Treatment options for neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and autism are currently limited. Antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia are not effective for all patients, do not target all symptoms of the disease, and have serious adverse side effects. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs to treat the core symptoms of autism. In an effort to develop new and more effective treatment strategies, stem cell technologies have been used to reprogram adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be differentiated into neuronal cells and even 3D brain organoids. This new technology has the potential to elucidate the complex mechanisms that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders, offer more relevant platforms for drug discovery and personalized medicine, and may even be used to treat the disease. Unfortunately I cannot fi

They told me they’ll know once I have another episode so here I am. One pdoc said there is no way I have sz because one episode is not enough to dx sz. So here I am now 10 years later with another episode? So is it sz? I am pretty annoyed they took me off the antipsychotic ,… I was alright to stay on it, not keen though but wasn’t objecting to it."

174390602,"It was just one symptom I found online. Thought broadcasting. It made me think of my telepathic experiences. And I’m still experiencing it. I found this symptom online because I thought I was diagnosed with autism in the first place. I did a lot of research about it. I know in _NAME_ book, boys are more prone to autism schizophrenia and all this stuff. I did went online paranoid for a few months. I was afraid some girl was making fun of me online or some kinda cyberbullying. What does telepathic experiences have to do with this symptom? I then found I was misdiagnosed. I did search online about autism in psychology today, and found someone who commented was diagnosed and realized he/she had lost courage because of his/her diagnosis. I was diagnosed with selective mutism. How did I know this girl? I’m diagnosed with selective mutism, I didn’t know that I thought it was autism or social anxiety. That means I don’t talk at all. One day at a science project, she gave me a letter because I can
t talk at all. I did reply her. Than it all became very awkward. My attempts trying to talk… Awkward. I even remember when I was going up the highest floor at school just to talk with her. But the prefects stopped us. She always blushes like she has social anxiety. In music whenever I heard something related to me, like run away or help me… I think my reputation is bad. At the restaurant yesterday, I just talked about it with my grandmother. Thought broadcasting. I’m not sure whether the others could hear because the table behind, I spoke some Cantonese when I heard them speaking Cantonese (to my grandmother). Sometimess it makes my head feel bad (in other places). When they left… I had experiences of this so I didn’t think in the way it was going… In a YouTube tedtalk I saw online. _NAME_ the physician made a talk about visual hallucinations. Blind people could have that syndrome. It was because a part of the brain becomes hyperactive. In another YouTube video, scientists were making research ab
out creating brains. There is even a part that said we could heal the electrical signals in our brains. I try to forget it… I’m healthy and why I would encourage negative thinking?"

He doesn’t want to seek help. Because, all the things that are true to him are actually false. I mean the fact that you are medication compliant implies that you have doubt. You are seeking treatment because you have doubt."

176188628,"It’s 02:10 where I am and I’m EXHAUSTED. Ready for bed but wanted to tell you guys first all what happened As you know from my previous threads in this last day, my husband and I been having problems in our marriage. Firstly with my sza/borderline symptoms scaring him - now with him scaring me! He’s got temporal lobe epilepsy real bad and besides his seizures he gets sz-like psychosis. This past evening he started getting really delusional and laughed and talked a lot to himself and paced around upstairs whilst I was anxiously below hovering by front door. In end it was too much for me and I called his dad to come help me. And went to security guy in our complex to ask him to help too. Whilst we waited for his parents to arrive, my husband was on phone to his cousin, warning him against “them” and then finally his parents came with his uncle too. His mom stayed in car and his dad and uncle went in house to talk to him. Then things got violent and hubby pushed his uncle and dad and finally 
his uncle had a choke hold on him and security came to assist. His dad left to get police and came back with armed response guys who decided what to do. Called state ambulance but they took so long they called police - but they took so long so we decided to call private ambulance even though it would cost. Whilst waiting hubby was still ranting and trashed kitchen and opened and upset bird cage and Sky flew out. It was a mercy he didnt fly away out the door! But he was safe and later i cleaned cage and caught him. Phew! _PERSON_ also screamed OPEN THE GARAGE DOOR!!! over and over and woke up whole neighbourhood. He talked to neighbours who had come out and upset and confused them. Confused me too! He told me earlier on this evening that the street near another uncle’s house would cause a spiritual splitting apart of us. That the area is polluted. He spoke of us being in plot to rob him - that’s why he attacked his uncle. He also attacked his dad a second time when he was praying upstairs and disturbed him 
so much his dad cried. I was in pieces myself. Outside I spoke to his uncle and told him that this is the end of our marriage. This night-psychosis crisis happened before - in Dec 2013 - and I was ready to leave him but now that it’s happened again I decided it’s the end now. For my own safety. His uncle agreed. It wasn’t only this that made me decide it’s best to leave him, but the insidious poisoning of my mind against others - his family, my family, Muslims in general, and our neighbour. He called him names to me and tonight the neighbour was so kind to me that I knew hubby was wrong about him. He had habit of speaking ill of others and making me believe they are bad. I’ve finally realised he is even more toxic than his mom. I love him but I can’t cope with this anymore So while he’s in hospital I plan to adjust to idea of life without him. I’m poor so I have to apply for disability, and I want to approach mental health organisation to ask their advice, and I’d like to be put on waiting l
ist for group home for mentally ill as I doubt I’d make it on my own. Then I’d stay with my parents till I get a place, and try to get job in their rural town if I can. Hoping things will work out and I can make a way in world on my own… it’s hard to think my marriage is over but it just can’t continue anymore… I don’t plan to marry again. I’m not suitable for marriage because of my sza/borderline and paranoia and my lack of interest in sex and kids. I guess single will be better. I hope I will be strong enough to break up with husband when he’s better and all soft with me. I’m terrified because it will break my heart but I just can’t live with his toxic behaviour anymore… Oh God help me!!!"

I needed to alert the masses anyways and i had buncha writings in my notebook about what was going to happen. Eventually i just went to the hospital after my mom got sick of my ramblings lol.
176188673,There’s a lady on the family forum who keeps going on about how homeopathy cured her child of SZ. Like she won’t stop. There’s zero scientific reason to believe it does anything but she still swears by it. Correlation by causation or something. She’s literally just lucky to function without meds. This technology is studied though. It’s not just crystal waving or something. It totally deserves more of the spotlight. A working theory for SZ is that it’s a weak blood-brain barrier issue.

I dont fully understand the differences between paranoid personality, schizotypal, and schizophrenia, but j know personality disorders are more fixed and ingrained much like autism though to a lesser extent. Schizophrenia is more chemically driven disease and can be treated with antipsychotics. Treatment resistant schizophrenia exists too though so I dont want to make blanket statements.

I suppose the depression could be to small compared to the psychosis for sza if sz with depression is used or maybe it could mean the sz and depression occur in separate episodes. paranoid sz is when delusions and hallucinations are prominent and other symptoms aren’t a main component of the presentation. sza depressive type means there hasn’t been a manic episode, just sz and depression."

176188716,The only time I’ve been in the hospital was when I first got psychosis. I was hearing voices of the devil and my mom told me to go to the hospital. At the hospital they didn’t really do anything but tell me I probably have sz but I thought it was due to the fact that I had been fasting (only drinking water) for 14 days. I was in an extremely religious phase (that I’m out of now) and I thought fasting would give me blessings from G-d. The voices really hated fasting. Apparently it’s said that if you have a demon fasting is a way to get rid of it which was consistent with the way they were acting. They were extremely erratic commanding me to get back to my apartment as fast as possible so I could eat. And I did. Sometimes I wonder if the spirits would have been killed or banished if I kept fasting a little longer.

It took me thirty years but now I can relax and have peace of mind often. I feel on edge sometimes but except for a two day blip 5 years ago, I had not been hospitalized since 1990.

Out of these only 15q13.3, 16p11.2, 16p12.1 and 16p13.11 deletion/duplication regions did not throw up any obvious connections to EGLN gene targets nor to genes that flank EGLN genes. I guess they significantly increase risk rather than cause. I did also look at Marfan disorder, porphyria and xanthomatosis and Nieman Pick disorder which all cause psychosis or have it as a comorbidity and they all have one or more of these four flanking genes. The Parkionson’s genes I looked at were LRRK2, PARK7, PRKN and PINK1. Only PINK1 did not follow this pattern but it does link directly to EGLN3 function. The pattern hol

You just have to look at the big picture: there’s literally billions of both men and women who are every size and shape, of every nationality, ugly or just plain looking, who are having regular sex all around the world. Looks or size does not exclude you from finding a mate or a sex partner. If you treat women decently and with respect the odds are you might stumble across one that really likes something about you and might give you a chance to get to know her and you might both hit it off and it might go further."

My vision was off to the right and if I didnt already do a lot of vision therapy I wouldnt have noticed it until I got prism glasses. The prism glasses brought me back to center. They alter your perception and you only need to wear them for a few months for the therapeutic effect. I highly advise anyone on this forum to find a doctor who knows how to treat with prism glasses. My theory is that everyone feels the way they do based on their visual perception. You dont know how much your vision can improve until it does. You tend to not notice when your vision gets worse and you end up with a diagnosis like this. Another thing that helped me tremendously are iv antibiotics. I have lyme disease which most people with mental illness have and iv antibiotics have helped clear up my brain so much. Btw I have been hospitalized 20 times with psychosis and I’m only 28 so it’s been a nightmare but I’m always looking for 
ways to treat this condition because I value life so much and ever since getting I’ll it’s not really living. Now up to today. I’ve been taking CBD for the past 5 days. 25mg everyday. I felt nothing until today. All of a sudden around dinner time I felt extremely sleepy and after that all of a sudden my world opened up. The derealization depersonalization cleared up 90%. Its incredible. I was looking for antipsychotic effect or something to just numb my feelings and the CBD makes me feel actually just normal. Not numb, not sedated, not relaxed, just absolutely for the first time in 10 years normal. Theres a huge misconception that because the studies used 600+mg that you need to use that much. I got this advice from many people. This stuff is absolutely INCREDIBLE. You have to try it. It doesnt work right away. It could take a week. But you have to try it."

176188789,"The best way I know of to quit smoking is using the patch and the lozenges at the same time. Use the patch for your baseline nicotine and then every great once in awhile, when you just can’t take it anymore and think you’re going to have to have a cigarette you have a lozenge instead. That worked for me to quit. But I started again. But when I stop I’ll do the same thing again and I know it will work."

176188792,yea my brain/memory is messed up too but i think it’s better than being psychotic though…
176188793,I don’t even look at myself barely. I catch a glimpse when I brush my hair and teeth. Other than that I don’t look. I hate the way I look so I know how you feel. But it’s more important to be a good and kind person and to be beautiful on the inside than to be beautiful on the outside. So focus on being kind and good and forget the mirror.
176188794,"I do! Ive been in Sweden for a year. First time I came here from the US almost 2 years ago I had a major breakdown and ended up in the hospital, but the program allowed me to come back, and this time (despite another hospital stay) I’m doing great!

174390693,"So I haven’t been studying this past week at all. Instead I’ve been focused on the relationship between my brain and the environment. Schizophrenia has a genetic component, I think that is well established, however I don’t think that genes determine behaviour in an absolute sense. How genes relate to the environment and vice versa is what determines behaviour. This can be seen by the racial skewing of schizophrenia. It is not because of genetics that certain groups are more prone to schizophrenia, it is because of how the environment relates to these genes. The psychiatrist _PERSON_ was famous for saying that mental illness was a breakdown of society in relation to the patient, not the other way around. The problem with this analysis is that it is very hard to change one’s environment except in a limited way. One person against the world is not likely to succeed. Thus we have to accept our environment to a certain degree, but that doesn’t mean we have to condone it. Being very careful wit
h nourishment, what comes in and out of ourselves becomes ever more important. This is true of diet but it is also true of words. How we craft our communication is one of the hardest challenges that schizophrenics face. What comes out of our mouths comes back to us so long as we are attached to our discourse. Shaping our words through juxtaposition, trying to always be positive, give good things to the world at large, and not try to take from others without asking, whilst trying to survive is that much more difficult for the schizophrenic and it is this that I have been focusing on this last week. At some point, I will have to return to study. I want to start my shiatsu course again after missing half a term due to relapse. I also want to start studying maths again in preparation for tutoring. Practicing physical activity is largely something I want to do to help me with relationships. I want to do yoga as well as shiatsu but am less inclined to t’ai ji at the moment although I am more attracted to it as a 
challenge. Muscular exercise like running or going to the gym doesn’t appeal to me at all, but perhaps that is my failing. I will start studying again, but for the time being I am focused on developing my capacity to love and accept. I hope everyone had a happy new year. Thank you."

No one said anything so I’m assuming I’ll live to see another day. I go to see the cardiologist on Friday to go over the results of all the testing.

174390687,"If you believe your boyfriend is the devil that is not “making up” your problems. It is common for people with mental illness to be worried they are faking or being dramatic. Trust me, mentally healthy people do not experience such beliefs. Also schizophrenia and psychosis is not as uncommon as you might think. 1% of the population has it (that is just counting sz not all psychotic disorders if you did that incidence would be higher) which i believe is far more than 1000 out of 7 billion.

176188887,"The real key to anger management is accepting that you’re responsible for your own actions at all times. Even when you want to rage, you need to make sure you don’t hurt others with your words or actions. There are all kinds of coping skills, but they all rely on you taking personal responsibility for your effect on the world around you."
174390701,"So I’ve been taking a crapload of vitamins and supplements every day and also getting a lot of healthy omega fats and beans (beans help the gut and people w/ schizophrenia miss things that come from beans). Anyways, I was having a rough time this year, and it always leads right in to me having an episode and going to the hospital. This year, out of the many times I have been hospitalized, I was actually able to pull out of the nosedive, and it’s also the ONLY year I had been taking all of the supplements and healthy things, but also the ONLY year I have been able to correct myself and stay out of the hospital. It’s proof enough to me that the supplements and healthy diet affect symptoms and maintaining directly and I just wanted to share."
176188888,"I used to look forward to food time and coffee break time specially when they let me out to go to the cafe and buy a coffee. The food was delicious in the last hospital and think it was good in the other two I was in as well. I was usually so scared and messed up but food felt comforting but I’m usually anorexic when I first go in hospital I stop eating and drinking thinking the water is poison etc but once I start eating again I really enjoy it and look forward to those times of the day and waiting for lunch for instance. I wasn’t the only one who waited for food longingly. Two people at last hospital I was in ordered pizza delivery and ate pizza in the psych ward. At the last hospital I was in we got hot _NAME_ at night but only if we asked for it. This was a special treat we enjoyed and sometimes there would be a line up for hot _NAME_ at night. It’s good they had art therapy,music therapy,relaxation and exercise etc at the psych ward. They made great coffees at the hospital cafe and they 
were nice."

176188901,I used to have the same delusion but meds got rid of it.
174390709,"no one prescribes benzos they are addictive.anyway im rambling on,sorry."
176188902,Im disaster. I feel so pain. Like i dont have a clue does anyone of you is feeling not ill but all of your family members tells youre ill. So confused. So in pain. Like every thing that i have in me was stolen. I cant breath. Im trying but its hard. Can be alive for long in this way.
176188903,"Its just addictive, smoking is much worse with smoking chemicals, studies showed vaping nicotine is 95% healthier than smoking."
174390711,"Its definitely a Brain disorder, Thought Disorder"

176188906,"Oh yeah, I whole heartedly believe I’m an oddball. Normal people don’t have my experiences that changed me. They haven’t seen what I’ve seen, learned what I’ve learned. I’m odd, but that doesn’t mean I’m bad"
176188907,"You said it yourself _AT_MENTION_ , it’s never too late."
174390706,"My first diagnosis was simply major depression; that psychiatrist was wayyyyy off. Then it was bipolar with psychotic features, then schizoaffective bipolar-type. It took me many years before I would accept schizoaffective as my dx; I didn’t want to be schizo- anything, but I eventually accepted it. I just can’t believe my first psychiatrist couldn’t see the psychosis in me; looking back I’ve had psychosis since I was 15, just didn’t get on an AP until I was 23, but yeah, really I’ve had schizoaffective for 26 years. I’m 41 years old now."
174390708,I used to drink 2 liters of diet coke or Pepsi a day for years. I think it gave me schizophrenia.
176188908,I think that is gorgeous! But I bet it would sell better as a square than a rectangle.
174390710,Does anyone have any idea when roluperidone might be availiable in the UK?
176188909,I looked more like this before moving in 1 year ago. I’ve aged years in 1 year here.

176188911,I know I’m just a ?????? up sh!t joke artist.
176188912,"Dont think about when you should sleep Its stressing. I take two common sleep meds, they never get me to sleep, they are calming. Obs, My opinion."
176188913,I’m trying to start going to the gym. It’s been difficult with all the snow I’ve been getting here
176188914,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with depression. I truly believe that if you just hang in there, you’ll eventually feel better. I used to be very suicidal from the time I was 16 until I was 37. But now I have a great husband and I’m on Celexa and I’m no longer suicidal. It really can get better. Please call a hotline to get through what you’re feeling right now. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_"
176188915,yeah! Thank you very much
176188916,I have slept good and now I don’t feel very sedated. I’m ok. I have done 30 minutes exercise like every day and I have showered.
176188917,"I don’t know what I’d do without the forum. You guys are often the most normal part of my day, given the situation I’m living in right now."
176188918,"No need to be sorry, languages are good, in my physical life I never use English, but this forum helps me to maintain my English abilities. I read also many news in English."
176188919,"I had a drawing of my DnD character commissioned. I gave a description and the artist sent me a rough sketch, then a finished drawing. I paid about $20 for it."
176188920,Happy to hear the klonopin helped. It helps me too.
176188921,"The turkey means nothing, in the long run. Look at it this way. She insisted on things, and they were utter failures. Just more proof that she is wrong when she bosses you."
174390717,Are rexulti or vraylar available there ?
176188922,Congratulations! I’m so happy for you
176188923,"Thanks for the replies guys, I have calmed down a little bit. Im going to see my dentist on Monday and hopefully he prescribes me a antibiotic. I think I have an infection in my swollen gums."
176188924,I don’t know. You’d have to ask _PERSON_.
176188926,You didn’t know that? Maybe it’s something you and I should work on in therapy. Do you go to a counselor?
176188927,"Thank you, everyone, for your well wishes. I will keep them in my heart."
176188928,People are rude One time my mother dated a guy and was sleeping with each other. I was in the closet. And I could hear them Then I had to speak up about it He didn’t listen
176188929,I’m definitely interested.
176188930,I have an ongoing phonebill with my phonecompany. They always find something to charge me with and i cancelled months ago. I just pay and pay. They are so big as it belonged to the government before it got privatized. I wouldn’t stand a chance in court.
176188931,Does anyone suffer frequent headaches? I have a headache everyday. One wakes me up every night in the middle of the night. A tension headache. Sometimes they turn into migraines if I don’t treat them right away. It’s been this way for many years. I also have sinus headaches at the same time so it’s pretty miserable. Makes me grumpy.
176188932,"Thanks for the frankness. Food for thought. Partly philosophical (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, solipsism etc.), partly drawn from gnosticism, partly other private beliefs. That’s what I’m trying to find out. Your response about duality (“without bad no good”) has been the dominant explanation of the existence of evil in a universe purportedly created by an all-loving, all-powerful god, but it is very problematic so unsurprisingly there have been even within christianity challenges to this view. But let’s not go down the path of religious discussion. It’s precisely the obsessiveness of it that makes me think sometimes that it has more to do with OCD and radical doubt than with delusional fixed beliefs. Let’s see what the doctor says. In gnosticism the real god is good, but he didn’t create the universe. I love this, but I’m not sure I’m entitled to! We are too weak to withstand too much ‘tough love’. Thank you everyone, even if the replies paint an inconclusive picture."
176188933,i hope you can get in contact with your caregivers otherwise i’d go to the ER like others said.
176188934,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . I am glad that you had achievements, but my tip is to try to steer your psyche into future feats. Looking at the past is counterproductive. I am glad that you feel driven."
176188935,"2012 I weighed 37kg… 2018 I weighed 96kg 2021 I weigh 72kg The plan is to get to 55kg. Basically, been all kinds of weights!"
176188936,"_AT_MENTION_ , please work with your doctor to address side effects. Please stop posting misinformation about prolactin on this site."
176188937,What is a capgras delusion?
176188938,"More Dopamine Hits or Withdrawals? Does that seem like bipolar drugs to you, to who?."
176188939,Where I worked people were talking about going to the raid. I guess they don’t mind going to federal prison for trespassing.
176188940,"Personally, Since COVID hit last March, I look forward to going to work. I work as as janitor in an office building and almost all the soldier/office workers are working from home. Even before COVID hit and there were a lot of the office workers I liked going to work because I got to work by myself. But since last March I’ll have whole wings of the building to myself. It’s quite and peaceful and the work has always been easy anyways but now I can take my time and just kind of daydream or try to solve problems. On my days off I’ll go to one of the numerous drive thru restaurants around here and order something and eat it in my car listening to music. I just need to get out of the house."
176188941,Stress is probably an epigenetic factor it’s just so difficult to control. Cos anxiety gives you stress and I got that all the time cos of personal reasons.
176188942,Yes I do… At times… I’ve learned how to deal with it a little
176188943,"I have listened to 40hz sounds via youtube. Have read that 40hz lights are not valid via a computer or tv. Supposedly, these devices do not hsve the capability. Strobe lights however can be set at real 40hz."
176188944,Just came off call from him. He upset me so much I yelled into the phone and paced the floor. My sister is upset at him too. I blocked his number again after her advice. He’s claiming there’s no one to help him and he can’t go back to his parents because he doesn’t get along with them. He doesn’t understand why I want a divorce. He’d do anything to keep me. Begging me to reconsider. I’M SO SICK OF THIS RIGHT NOW. He’s acting desperate and it’s upsetting me. He’s always been an indecisive person. Settles his mind - then changes it. Then settles then changes. Damn it! Am I to be stuck with a man (even though I love him) who doesn’t have any family on his side? I don’t want to be in a ???? family like his. And I’m not responsible for looking after him if I want to leave for my mental wellbeing! How do I deal with this??? I start to feel guilty for wanting to leave him. But what else can I do? He promises he’d do ANYTHING for me and even for my sister etc. AAAARRRGGGHHH! I ca
n’t deal with this right now! He can’t force me because he doesn’t get along with his family. Surely someone will help him??? He said no but I don’t believe that. How can there be nobody in his big family that would help him??? ????!!!
176188945,It’s 4:30 am and I just had a piece of salmon and a glass of grape juice.
176188946,yeah i guess i just have to get over it
174390725,"I take CBD for anxiety and paranoia (gummies and capsules ranging from 20 mg - 50 mg), and it’s been a wonder drug. I have some hemp flower on the way, and I can’t wait to try it. Hopefully it gives me a higher dose of CBD, and really puts my anxiety away. I’ve told my pdoc and case manager about me using CBD, and they’re supportive of it. But I would ask your pdoc about it – each doctor is different."
176188947,"Yo mama so fat, her blood type is rocky road."
176188948,"I wouldn’t answer either. If it takes a little lie to keep a job, so be it. I wouldn’t say anything to my new employer."
176188949,"Hahah Love it mate. _PERSON_ had a yorkshire tea today . Been doing the coffee, but ill remember that in the morning when i have one lol."
176188950,Calm down a bit and you’ll feel better. You can share this at your group therapy tomorrow. What do you mean you start school tonight? You at school at night? Sorry i dont get it
176188951,"Piano gal, just curious do you play piano? Also ever heard Yiruma “a river flows in you”"
176188952,I just called to make sure my ride was coming and they said group was cancelled for awhile due to Covid. Why? We sit 6 feet apart and wear masks. I hate Covid.
176188953,"Time consuming and expensive. It’s a fun hobby, but expect to go out of pocket a few grand a year. I don’t make a penny back as there’s no advertising revenue and I don’t sell merchandise."
174390732,Its probably due to side effects of AP medications I think as I too have severe negative symptoms for many years now but not taking any medication and my BMI is around 19. Few years back its even lower than 17.5. Exercises and activity is very less and also having normal food three times a day.
176188954,The only time you’ve been flagged was when you requested us to delete an old post of yours.
176188955,I was allowed to mix that orange flavored water bottle powder with mine. It really does help. The procedure goes well but gosh that whole prep business is horrible. Imho.
176188956,They say this hasn’t been affected by the virus but I know they are trying to sell me a franchise.
176188957,"do you think it would be better like in the sense there would be more free thought association and the patient would also not see if the pdoc is judging you, just talk freely and openly"
176188958,I suffered childhood abuse when I was younger. I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was around 14 years old.
176188959,"When I had these problems, I would cut the process. I would be watching the TV but be listening to voiceless music at the same time with the TV muted. Hope it helps you too."

176188963,"Reading more thoroughly, you also maintain a job during a time of serious worldwide trauma. That is huge. Technically, you have two jobs. Just managing psychosis is a full time job in itself. Anyone with a mental illness and a job is working at least twice as hard as their peers."
176188964,"I need more support one counselor is not enough, i finally got license therapist that is willing to work with me, with paranoid thoughts, delusions and anxiety, and my fear of dyeing in my sleep."
176188965,I had an IQ test once. The tester flat out told me that mental illness can impact scores and cause people to score much lower than they actually should. My own IQ was quite high but the tester said he felt my score should actually be even higher but certain elements of my illness had impacted my performance.
176188966,That’s something to bring up to your Pdoc immediately. Blacking out is dangerous.
176188967,I still have a job but i don’t want to go back… still feel people hate me… it shouldn’t matter as I shouldn’t care but I do… im tempted to look for another job and I probably will after I feel well enough to be working…
174390720,I don’t think you have to tell anyone that your schizophrenic. You could just say I take meds to calm down and act funny if I don’t take them. You don’t want to scare them. I mean like if your just dating and not living together or that serious. Even if the relationship is serious or you are married I don’t think you have to be so like o I have schizophrenia I hear voices like just play it cool some things are best kept between yourself and your doctor.
176188968,I feel like the guy in the video alll the time.
176188969,I have no idea. I was supposed to get benefit when I was diagnosed but I was homeless and ended up going back to work as it took too long to get.
176188970,"Now he’s reading this thread, Now he’s sending signals with his mind (i don’t). He is playing the kazoo"
176188971,"That sounds delightful! Make sure to bring a phone or a buddy if you’re going out alone Ain extreme weather, and stay hydrated! In the winter, it’s easy to get dehydrated because the air is so dry, and because we aren’t getting hot so we don’t get thirsty as often."
176188972,How old was everyone when you started having symptoms? I had an imaginary friend when I was 6 that I still see to this day. My symptoms came in stages. I was around 8 when I started hearing voices sometimes and I was 12 when I started having delusions. My first psychotic episode was when I was 15. I’m now 18 and hearing and seeing things is part of my everyday life. Delusions come and go I never know when I’m delusional until it’s over. I also smell things and feel things but they are harder to tell if it’s reality or not.
176188973,"My sister told me that men find hard to stomach that a woman does not wish to go further. For men, this means questioning their own identity. I don’t know what to think about it. I must say that i dread to be completely blanked. I really don’t know."
176188974,My shift at work wasn’t too bad. I feel good. I’m off tonight.
176188975,"Uh, and other chemicals. Put some straight orange juice into your vape and see if it still works. I only vape as a means of controlling urges to smoke that refuse to go away. Wouldn’t have started if not for that. I don’t think it’s as dangerous as it’s being made out to be, but it’s certainly not safe and if you don’t need to use it, don’t."
176188976,"Good days are possible. You’re getting healthy. The pills are working well. You successfully use your tools. It’s ok to feel good, it doesn’t mean you’re faking."
176188977,But a little girl showed up and picked up the book.
176188978,The different shaped bottles collection are they of one kind like medicines or perfumes or do you like them for the color
176188979,"I almost relapsed last year from the stress of having a lousy roommate who constantly harassed me. As soon as he moved out, I recovered completely. So my little advice is deal with anything that’s stressing you. Sometimes something as simple as going to park to get some space and fresh air and a nice walk might be a good way to cope. It might at least relax you for a short while."
176188980,Nice one _AT_MENTION_
176188981,Why would I take lithium? My antipsychotics are working great for me.
176188982,"Its for bipolar disorder. I took it, didn’t help with sz. Its a very strong med, it caused me tingling, tirendness, made me sleepy and caused eyelid tremors. Be cautious with it because it can cause hypothyrodism and weight gain."
176188983,"I left my mothers care when I was 9 years old after she gave me and my middle sister another beating and put my middle sister in hospital. Me and my middle sister got put on Full Care orders and put in foster care while my older sister stayed with our mother. We stayed in care until we both tuned 18. I spoke to my older sister recently and she told me she’s been diagnosed with psychosis but is reclusive. I wished my mother a happy Christmas just today and told her I’ve been attending online church sessions. She wrote this back on fb -_NAME_ (my older sister) made her choice and like what I told her …Satan will come after her and he did…’’ My mother posts over-radical Christian stuff on Facebook and is outright against gay people. She’s not a good Christian. I live my own life without much input from my Mum. I have traveled some of the world, am dependable on myself, been through a lot of hardships and come out of them a better person and stronger. I coped without my mother and managed 
to have a good life even with SZA, My older sister has always been with my mother, never been abroad. My mother telling her that because she hasn’t accepted Christ that’s why the Devil is after her, that must play into her mental health… I’m glad I left my mothers care and got put into foster care, I’ve had a much better life. My mother is toxic. I feel sorry for my older sister."
176188984,"Lately I have been simmering with rage. Not exactly sure why. Could be a combination of things. Such as, I’m worried about starting a new job in a few days time, I have an appointment soon for seeing someone about dealing with psychological trauma I endured when I was younger. I also switched the type of nicotine replacement therapy I have been using. I have no money for a while. I also have shizoaffective disorder so I could be having a bit of a mood swing. I’m usually such a chill person but I’m so angry. I feel anger rising up and then I twitch physically. It’s probably just all these things mashed together making me feel completely out of control and pissed off. I almost just wanna go stay in hospital for a bit but I’m not psychotic at the moment so it would be hard to get in. If you’ve read all this I apologise for the rant but I don’t have many people I can talk to over this weekend about this stuff."
176188985,"This happens to me as well. The voices consist of various deities ranging from Catholicism to the Occult; They tell me to do things to avoid negative outcomes and I never knew they were hallucinations until 2 weeks ago. All this time I swore they were real and I should listen to them up until this happened. I was having a episode and I heard similar voices that told me previously they were there to help me in life. Suddenly the deities started to tell me to hurt myself and to die. After it all I asked them “why did you talk to me like that?” they said it wasn’t them that it was my mind… But the voices originated from my mind, even if the metaphysical was from a external force, it still filters through my mind. It has been like this on and off to the point where I accept death as a truth and live the best way I can."
176188986,Huh???what do you mean? _AT_MENTION_
176188987,You ever tried British style black tea (with/without milk/sugar)? It kinda refreshes my body and I think gives a bit of mind clarity. Might be just me though
176188988,It turned my sexuality very feminine I started crossdressing and wearing adult diapers after. But I would never sleep with a man I’m just a freak attracted to beautiful women haha.
174390728,i like to see it too =3 really curious about it
176188989,"I liked the hospital, met some nice people there and food was good"
176188990,"i called my sister and asked her what to do in an emergency, and she gave me some reassurance, it seems to be a bit better now, i think a lot of people will be very worried even with minor symptoms of colds and things over Autumn/Winter bc of everything that has happened with covid19"
176188991,I tried getting off meds once and I relapsed and had to go to the psych ward again. I think my meds are stable now and i won’t get off anymore.
176188992,"The funniest was in high school Some kids were browsing the web when the ‘this site is blocked’ message came up. The teacher walked behind, saw the sign and said 'O, look! We are on Big Boobies.com again!"" That was funny"
176188993,As to what kind of parents they could be to us. Nobody’s that wonderful. I wish they had known it.
174390726,"I had religious delusions, and severe paranoia. I also suffered from severe depression, before taking clozapine I was very suicidel."
176188994,"I was a dental assistant for years, They’re going to take good care of you tomorrow. You’ll feel a lot better in a couple weeks with all those infected teeth gone. Be strong, _AT_MENTION_ , you can do this."
176188995,"Yeah, these are the best symptoms I’ve ever had."
176188996,"i was prediabetic, but i lost forty or fifty pounds and changed my diet, and now i’m normal"
176188997,"I have loved you. And from the beginning to the end, I have loved you. I dare not to place the burden on my brother’s shoulders. But please do not dare to place the burden on me. If love has a place for you, then you should have known That your shame does not come from the love of my brother. One day, if the Heavens graciously allow me to go before him He will know, eventually, the burden. His children may carry it, and the next, to the next. Why does our burden rest in the riverbed, then? You say that you are truly sorry for my physical illness; Fear not. You have done nothing. But you have dropped the burden wrapped in my clothes And threw a part of me into the Han River. Fear not. You will spend your entire life thinking about me in love, And I, thinking about you in love, and my part drowned in the river."
176188998,Ah ha…_PHONE_NO_
176188999,"I feel this way too. I don’t know how I’ll ever live without my mom. When the time comes, we’ll just have to find a new normal."
176189000,I still enjoy alcohol in social situations. I still drink regularly but I don’t drink to get drunk. A couple of midstrength beers to relax isn’t too bad for your health. Overdoing it or drinking to get drunk really is the start of a problem. For me. Replacing negative things with positive things is the way to go. Instead of smoking I’d walk. These days I’m into exercise. It is still a chemical rush but it’s way more healthier and leads to better things. Try some positive exercise. It gets easier and even can be addictive. Way better than the booze.
176189001,"And sometimes lyme disease mimics sz. When treated with medicine, sz symptoms diminish."
176189002,"What do you do with your free time if you don’t mind me asking? Is there are something that prevents you from cleaning it? I know depression and negatives all too well. But I make myself a time once a week to maintain and clean my apartment. Perhaps there are some serious distractions in your life that are preventing you from taking an action. Television? Computer? This is not a discriminatory post but rather call to action instead. Take care yourself, because nobody else will."
174390729,"Do you have things that trigger your psychosis? For me its religion, horror movies/video games, blood, violence, diseases like Dr House etc I cant see someone sick even on TV as it triggers me. Dr House was my favorite show before sz."
176189003,"Thanks! I try lol Dont think Ive seen you here before, do you make music?"
176189004,"I don’t believe this is anti-meds, _AT_MENTION_ . It’s pro-options. If it’s not an option for you to go off of meds, then it’s not an option for you, but under supervision and care it certainly is proven to be an option for some percentage. Even if it’s a low percentage, it exists. As understanding for this disability grows, there are inevitably going to be new ideas, etc. I think keeping an open mind is important. We wouldn’t want to still be stuck in the days when lobotomy was considered standard treatment. If we move towards least invasive treatments, if they are effective and useful, it’s progress. Also, I have suffered immensely at the hands of sz. It’s not something I sought out or that I wish I had, etc. It’ been the most prevalent and real experience of my life (unfortunately). However, I have stumbled through the years, not committed suicide, stayed vigilant in working towards function and have survived and improved without medications. I actually don’t recommend it, bu
t here I am, alive and functioning…"
176189005,"Psychosis isn’t a one size fits all. For some people it is a living hell where they can’t function at all due to a constant barrage of hallucinations and distorted reality and they struggle to find the right medications. For others it’s not so bad, their meds work well and they have found good ways to cope and live their best lives. Be it volunteering, holding down a job, or just being at peace with their situation. I think a lot of us fall somewhere in the middle, but I definitely think it is okay for people to think its cool and okay to have this illness if thats what they experience, and I think its okay for people to think it is the worst thing that has happened to them. Psychosis is a very personal thing. Its like a fingerprint or a snowflake, meaning that my experience with psychosis is personal to me, and it is an individual experience. It isn’t right for anyone else to tell me how I should experience it or feel about it."
176189006,So they aren’t robots.
176189007,It’s here: Thread’s locked though. We shouldn’t talk too much about it ok. DMs only please.
174390738,"Zyprexa is good, closest to Clozapine in strength. Its one of the strong APs like Risperdal."

174390731,You’re still young so you got that going for you. I’ve had schizophrenia since I was 19 and I’m 59 now. All evidence seems to say that I’ll have it for the rest of my life. I’ve gotten better though and my symptoms have improved.
176189013,I’m a 51 year old woman with mobility issues and sza. I think there is no chance I’d find work. I don’t think I could work anyway. I would like to take a creative writing course some day.
176189014,I sometimes get urges to jump out of moving cars as well. I am glad you calmed down before you got home
176189015,"that there as apoint to all this schziophrenic suffering…i used to think there was a goal (mission)…i used to think all this experience was leading somewhere eg be a psych nurse, social worker ot therapist…but now after 18 yrs of this sz madness and suffering, ive come to believe that there is no point…that my life is wasting away…that i feel im helping nobody …but i feel im just wasting away for no point"
176189016,The price I pay is $1.25 with Medicare part d extra help. Under masshealth medicaid alone it was 3.65 Zyprexa alone costs nearly 600 dollars a month without insurance.
176189017,I was 54 years old.
176189018,Idk. I like myself though. I have good self esteem but I definitely couldn’t say that years ago.
176189019,"Really wish mental disorders could be diagnosed with blood tests. However if that were true they’d probably also be communicable by blood, which would suck so much it would outweigh the benefit of testability."
176189020,I got some TMG yesterday. The stuff is great. I’m taking 500 mg once a day. Definitely has an effect. It’s nice.
176189021,You sound like you need to do some breathing exercises and chill out. Take your meds as prescribed - and dont sweat it. I doubt very much anyone is gonna track you down on this website so just relax.
176189022,"About 9 times, once a year for the last 9 years. _PERSON_ are really hard for me."
176189023,that’s a big dramatic.
176189024,I do. I can’t read books. I have major problems reading novels and other stuff.
176189025,"I miss being able to eat meat, but I’m allergic. Stupid lone star tick. Ruined steak forever."
176189026,I hope you like it
176189027,Were you able to exercise off meds?
176189028,"About a month for me, then I get worse fast"
176189029,I’m not sure _AT_MENTION_ . My husband and I share a car. How often do you have to go if it’s in store?
176189030,Take your medications. Create a support system. Learn your stress levels. Eat a donut once a month.
174390734,i had the same delusions and my psych said those are not mild. She said those are the worst ones to have
176189031,I thought the same thing; that there is a chip from a computer or/and a camera implanted in me. Have you seen “A Beautiful Mind”? I fight the delusion every day. I’m on Clozapine for my symptoms. Keep fighting!
176189032,Not sure _AT_MENTION_. It’s a random pic I got online
176189033,Funny thing is: I actually wish what you are saying was true. If I could get smarter from psychosis that would be great. Unfortunately…I believe in facts and studies and research. None of which you can provide. Just making wild statements.
176189034,"I’ve been on aps since I was 19, when I went to the mental hospital. So it has been 23 years."
174390735,"I don’t have emotions at all, my brothers often hit me with aggression so I understand. Also I have inappropriate emotion, I laugh at sad things, kinda sadistic and silly. Sometimes I laugh for no reason."
176189035,"I get it, a lot also, delusions of persecution! I wonder why people won’t get off my d#%$* Also. I hope it goes away for you!!!"
176189036,Yeah…Nothing good came of that but _NAME_ did the right thing even with _PERSON_ passing. So sad … Was a horrible story.
174390739,"btw If you ever get full psychosis again, your previous meds will probably not work, you’ll need stronger meds my psychiatrist told me. He also said changing meds reduces efficacy of meds. I was on low dose Abilify before I stopped meds. They put me on stronger antipsychotics after my 2nd psychosis, Olanzapine and then Risperdal."
176189037,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. My weight seems to be coming down so I should regularly check my BP from now on. Thanks for the heads up.
174390736,"If I were you , I’d quit thinking about your glorious past and take baby steps in a new beginning. Doing one small thing to begin."
176189038,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ I’d keep it but I’d feel bad since I made it for my friend
176189039,Today I weigh 56.7 kg. Just 1.7 kg to lose to get to my goal weight of 55kg. I just don’t want to eat less. Love my food. In February I was 63 kg. I am happy with my loss. I lost by eating a little less. I exercise less too though.
174390743,"Because my memory was erased I didn’t remember that I was tortured with an unbearable feeling, but my schizophrenia still remembered to torture me (and when to torture me) after that memory wipe. That means my schizophrenia has a different type of memory to use, which can’t be erased (the way my long term memory was erased). There was a period of time when my eyes were moving left-right-left-etc. They were moving at a fixed frequency and amplitude. They moved much more rapidly than I could move them. The voice told me the drugs (antipsychotics) wouldn’t work, even before I found out (after the memory gap) I’ve been given many different ap-s already and none of them worked. It has told me it would be ridiculous if they worked, because my schizophrenia is actually a condition of the consciousness/soul, not the brain. As I have written earlier, it appears to me my body is moving on its own. Due to this, I can’t tell for sure if I am controlling my body or something else. Sometimes my body do
es things I would never do, sometimes it behaves as I would. However, when an idea came to write “I, the writer, don’t know if I am _PERSON_ or not”, then the voice said “We cannot write that, because the spirit knows whether he is you, or not.” I would admit that I don’t know whether it’s me writing this or not, so if the writer cannot admit that, then it seems the writer is not me. In other words, I (_PERSON_) am unable to control my body. In that case, whatever is writing this here on my behalf and from my perspective, is not me. But if that is true, how can my body sometimes behave like me? After talking with my relatives I heard I apparently had some strange delusional beliefs. I got an inserted thought saying it could have been the spirit (that took control over my body) acting, not actual delusions. I heard I (or the spirit) was also not acting/talking like me during one of those times."
176189040,Battling the disease. I’m winning ! “Oh really” Says the disease.
176189041,root beer is my favorite flavor.
176189042,"I’m on 4.75mg. When I started it, I felt sick like I had been poisoned for 6 hours a day for 6 months. I was in very bad withdrawl from a .25mg cut for 2 years! I threw up a dose, and went into a painful scary crisis for a week and a half, now I am extremely sensitive to co q 10, sea kelp, and xanax. I go into scary painful crises and am extremely bad for months over these. I have anhedonia and nothing is interesting to the point of discomfort. Risperidone has ruined my life and I am afraid I won’t eat or sleep if I try switching. Nightmare med."
176189043,"I see in to the pale opaque sky with its many ponders I wander down the lonely road in search of dreams the sky in my inner eye I want to look past the clouds scan the horizon with its beautiful blushes into different realms wait for the night to shows its starry light caught through the passing of time and will our light shine just as bright? will we light the sky one day? forge our souls into the heavens as the hammer falls? maybe, i hear a whisper, ‘maybe’"
176189044,Not taking the 60k per year salary to be an IT tech for a medium sized business. I couldve had a good job and stuff. Oh well
176189045,"Hmm, I’m not good with sad songs …"
176189046,"Oh, well if you’re sick just rest and watch tv! I just meant when you’re well and are staring off, try to think of things you’d like to do and then do them. Also if your energy is low even when you’re not sick, have a blood test done. Check your thyroid and vitamin levels, and make sure you’re drinking enough water. Dehydration can cause fatigue. It could be the change in your estrogen has taken away energy too. I noticed a stark contrast in energy after having my ovaries removed."
174390740,"In trials it improved schizophrenia by 21% , in 6 weeks. All the trial patients were taking olanzapine."
176189047,I feel I need some so badly this morning. I will try and resist Mornings are very hard for me at the moment Not worth taking it. It’s a placebo more than anything and I should know better
176189048,the doctor who checked me out at hosdpital didn’t recommend the coffee enemas either… But lots of old waste came out…
176189049,I’m single and happy. I don’t think I’d be happy in a relationship. I’ve tried.
176189050,What is the administrator’s email address?

176189053,It has been going on for two years consistnely. All external voices. Seem to come in the direction of which they are. With their own thoughts and opinions. Telling me im a terrible listener because I cant stop thinking long enough to let them finish. I was sexually abused as a child and now I sexualize the people I believe the voices are coming from. Its ruining my life.
176189054,I do try to journal I find it a good way to collect my thoughts! But I mainly keep it in the form of poems and such. Why do you ask?
176189055,I think you need to stop checking her photos etc. it’s obsessive and unhealthy
176189056,"I had many Drs, they tried everything, only Abilify works. My last pdr said he can’t help me anymore."
176189057,"Do you have a wife or husband? If so, I would talk to them about it first, tell them specifically what’s happening (as much as you feel comfortable sharing) I actually haven’t gained any weight on it, but I do smoke cigarettes (a pack a day). I do drive. I’m pretty bad at it but I haven’t been in a major accident for years. I meditate, which helps me."
176189058,I spent arguing with my ex who wont leave me alone and let me raise our kids who I have been doing a damn good job of raising by myself. I told him that hes ugly and I’m not attracted to him which is true I didnt get with him for his looks but then he told me that he dated more beautiful women than me with better jobs this made me feel bad. He keeps using our kids as pawns to say things to me he wants me to do things his way and we are divorced. He brings my mental health down. I dont know how to get away from him. I try my hardest not to hold any conversation with him but he tries his hardest to hold conversation with me. He tries his hardest to flaunt his life in front of me and to let me know a little on what hes got going on. This isnt healthy for me and I really dont know what to do. He always criticize my life and put me down this is the main reason I divorced him and he is still doing it and we are divorced how can i get him to stop and leave me alone
176189059,"If there was it would be all over the news and we’d all know about it. While there are some supplements that some claim help alleviate symptoms somewhat, APs are still the most effective way of managing psychosis and I would not recommend trying to treat psychosis with supplements alone."
176189060,thanku so much _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_
176189061,There was a kid who after he got sick he started having symptoms of OCD. Once he took a course of antibiotics his symptoms cleared up. His mother wrote a book about it called Saving _NAME_: https://books.google.com/books/about/Saving_Sammy.html?id=I2W9wAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description
176189062,I dont really care what other people are doing. its a waste of time to think jealous of them. Better to put that energy towards doing something even if its small. But i would like to win lottery so i can just sleep lol
176189063,"I used to think the same about meds - my advice after finally getting better is DON’T STOP. The longer you take before you comply, the slower and less effective your recovery will be I was on/off meds for two years, until I finally broke down and cried and realised I have a mental illness which is why I failed medical school When I made the decision to fully comply things started to look better for me"
176189064,"Have you ever thought of making a movie of what you know about one of your subjects, you can look around the internet and get ideas of screen shots and articles to make it look it cool. Then you can play it back for yourself every once in a while and re-_USER_ID_ it with new information that you learn."
176189065,They are when I don’t take my meds. They are not when I do. That’s the difference between taking my meds and not taking them.
176189066,"Thanks _NAME_. I’m only 30 and don’t have any real serious consistent heart problems so idk what a cardiologist would do for me. In fact I went to the hospital for heart pains 3 times in the past at a time when I was experimenting with medicinal herbs (took way too many). Doctor send me away and said I quote “there’s nothing wrong with you”, even though I was on the brink of a heart attack. Not sure what they could do other than maybe prescribe me blood pressure lowering medication. Just wondering if anyone out there has any coping mechanism’s?"

176189070,CBD hemp is 100% legal in my country. I bought some cbd hemp a few months ago which I vaporised. It really helped my anxiety. Thing is apparently smoking it is a lot more effective then dry herb vaping. I like to smoke and could happily smoke the herb. Thing is it smells EXACTLY like weed. I mean identical. I live in close proximity to my neighbours and don’t want to upset them (thinking I am bracingly smoking weed which is 100% illegal here) I am on real good terms with my neighbours. I am thinking of asking them permission to smoke the legal hemp. I think forewarning them about the smell might make them not feel uncomfortable. What do you folks think?
176189071,Welcome to our little corner of the world.
176189072,I think my condition is better described as social anxiety than social withdrawal.

176189077,Wellbutrin has been great for me. I take 300mg. It’s helps with depression for me and _NAME_.
174390758,I don’t know what doxing is. I’m on the Olanzapine and Valium too. I’ve been on Olanzapine since 1997. It works for me but it took a long time to recover from psychosis. I no longer hear voices but I still get paranoia and my mind plays tricks on me. Olanzapine took a few years to get use to. I’m in a fog when I wake up because of it. I drink a lot of coffee to fight the sedation.
176189078,"I get panic attacks and increased paranoia almost every night. Trazadone helps some, I take 150 mg. Benzodiazipines don’t touch me. The best thing I’ve taken before for panic attacks is thorazine. But it has bad side effects."
176189079,Ah okay. I get the two settings mixed up.
176189080,I would have a hard time coping with being left in the dark like that. I like getting feedback and being updated on what is going good and what is not.
176189081,"Yeah, the problem with meeting them a few times is that it seems like you are kind of insulting them if you don’t choose them. Seeking out a specific therapy seems smart but again how to find them."
176189082,Nobody gives a ???? about me. Holidays always sucks for me. Like what am I here for I’m sick I struggle to do the basics and I fight so hard to make sure my kids have everything. I’m alone I take medicine just to function but I’m barely living. I’m tired of going to hospitals I’m tired of medication I’m even tired of wanting someone to be there because they cant help me. When my kids grow up they’re just going to leave. Everyone hates me no one sees what I do not even my ex. If I die life will go on. My battle buddy at least she’s at peace no more suffering. What’s the sense in fighting anymore. Maybe this christmas I might be gone for good. Life will move on like usual my kids will be happy. Then I will be at peace no worries and I dont want to come back to this earth no more hardship.
176189083,The TV does that ????. I can see the radio doing that projecting things. Hope you get to feeling better!
176189084,Oh heck yes good idea.

I am just curious as to how they ( meaning DOT ) could possibly find out. When I crashed my motorcycle and broke my color bone, the hospital asked about meds and listed all the ones I was on and asked if I was feeling like I’m going to be violent. (I did flip out at this hospital when i was 18 and didn’t take my meds, I was restrained by the cops and they sedated me). So I am just wondering if my medical records are available to dot or a place performing the physical? Thank you for answering so quick!!"
176189089,I’m happy with my lot and have been for decades. I don’t have to work and get disability but do some regular volunteering. It keeps me in the game and focused and I do some good things.

174390761,"Dear walterchang, congratulations on being a studious person and managing to graduate from what is considered to be higher education in the United States. With that being said, I as a person diagnosed with schizophrenia, am able to drive a car once again after a litigious process involving a revaluation of my cognitive impairment as well as physical ability to conduce a vehicle safely. It was a bearable and time consuming process, yet it is possible in the United State. Welcome to the forums. Considering you mentioned your current nation of residence, when I read your about your relatable qualm, my logic has come to a couple of presumptive (which I apologize for as I should not presume to know) conclusions, One is that you live in a very populous province in the world with all due respect to the Republic of China, and thus, those who are afforded the privilege to drive a vehicle are closely monitored after any erratic behavior which some of our symptoms as people with such conditions like schizophr
enia might experience. Thus, as there are others who would drive a vehicle if given the chance, despite your ability the worry that a college educated person could suddenly have a suicidal thought whilst driving may be a major factor in your allowance to drive. Do not think of it too negatively, instead I would recommend that you realize, this must mean that you are well respected and cared about among your peers and community. The second conclusion would indicate that due to tradition and permediated ideals of parents when it comes to being viewed as successful in the raising of a son, your parents might be worried you could find yourself in a difference scenario such as a traffic fine, or a violation of law enforcement and thus the authorities. Whilst being in such a province, the term, “Saving face.” comes to mind. As parents, they surely want to save face while feeling the normal necessity of not feeling futile in the raising of their child or age. This also is an indicative of their love and respect 
for you. There may be other factors, and perhaps the two coincide, however, all that being said, I believe if you, personally feel ready for the responsibility of having a driving license, then you should be able to seek out a way to travel safely in with accountability not just for yourself, but also for others on the road. Nonetheless, I do not know if you are afforded that liberty, or if you would find that you are allowed to do so. It is only personal input from one fellow sufferer to another, may all be well with you parents and yourself, please, do find a good moment in your day every day."

The basis for that being the mental health team not liking my non crime of needing and wanting more help and support , and believing character assassination was a compassionate and intelligent approach to providing mental health care . There was one pd that would have made sense as an add on to the schizoaffective dx, that being avoidant pd . The current pdoc is amiable and polite . That makes a refreshing change ."

I told my community nurse I know they tricked me and people on the internet have told me I don’t come across as intelligently disabled. He told me that people on the internet especially targeted Individuals websites are not that credible as they have mental illness themselves. I think the psychologist who did the IQ assessment didn’t do it properly as I was in my bungalow at the time convinced my neighbour was trying to kill me, he was evil. But community nurse says they don’t just look at IQ test results they look into school reports as well."

The negative side of being an extrovert is that they don’t like the feeling of not having another person around to “feed” off of so they don’t like being alone. While an introvert is better at being comfortable with themselves and handles being alone better."

174390771,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Analysis of risk factors and outcomes in psychiatric inpatients with tardive dyskinesia: A nationwide case-control study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and A _PERSON_, Heliyon , May 2019 To analyze comorbidities and outcomes in patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD) during psychiatric inpatient management.We conducted a case-control study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. It included 77,022 adult inpatient admissions for mood disorders and schizophrenia. Cases had a secondary diagnosis of TD, and controls without TD were matched for age. Multivariable logistic regression was used to generate odds ratio (OR).Majority of TD patients were older age adults (50-64 years; 40%), and were in nearly equal proportions of men and women. African Americans had two-fold higher odds of TD. TD patients had a higher likelihood for cardio-metabolic comorbidities-obesity (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.481-1.756), hypertension (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.635-1.930) and diabetes (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.414-1.680) compared to controls. 
They also had 1.5-fold increased risk of comorbid drug abuse. Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (depressive) had four-fold higher odds of TD. TD patients had about six-fold higher odds of severe morbidity. They had a higher likelihood of extended hospitalization stay by 6.36 days (95% CI 6.174-6.550) and higher cost by $20,415 (95% CI 19537-21293) compared to controls.Psychiatric inpatients with TD have greater severity of illness, and those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are at highest risk. Presence of TD portends poor hospital outcomes and need for higher acute inpatient care."

Don’t beat yourself up because you did it, but pay attention that you don’t make it a regular habit.

Then he’d almost immediately come up and ask me for something. He even started biting at his finger (like chewing off the skin so it bled) to get my attention. It was just sad really.

174390786,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . You have the wrong attitude. Your attitude is that because other people have assets that you don’t, it somehow makes you less valuable. You have to learn to accept yourself the way you are; I am talking from my own experience, and my position is by no means enviable: I am essentially a stable, low functioning schizophrenic. I have learned to accept my limitations and cherish the assets I do have. And you should do the same."

The hops in beer work directly on your nervous system to calm down. You need to get good nights sleep.

it my pharmacy. I have extras of everything except Xanax. My wife and my sister in law will steal that but I don’t have anything else they want. I have changed doses so many times that I have extras of every thing. I have Geodon in 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg. I have Wellbutrin in 100, 150 and 300. I have Latuda in 20, 40 and 60 mg. I even have extra Lunesta but I have always taken 3 mg so I don’t have variants of that. You can never be too careful."

176189254,"I know most cases are for severe instances. My psychiatrist reached out to a peer recovery specialist to help me with the addiction. I’m worried that my depression and symptoms are worse than for inpatient rehab. And that maybe going to the ER would be better for what’s going on. It would be short term they might keep me longer this time though maybe like 3 weeks because I am starting Prozac and I want to be monitored so I dont become psychotic or worsened depression. I did this before when I relapsed and it helped me. I only stayed three days but I saw the doctor every day and they were helpful and supportive. It was kind of boring, but I did heal and I got back to baseline."

In the states, where this occurred they(I think this is correct) they began giving her smaller rooms, had her take on a roommate, etc., when she didn’t (ahem) die fast enough. Due to family splintering we reconnected late in the game and would give her some money and she was happy bc it meant that she could get a haircut!

For me, feeling very different from everyone around me caused me to question myself and hate myself from a young age. Then, I had many secrets to keep that made me create a facade for others in order to hide my reality. Part of my delusion as a young teen to young adult was an extreme sense of belonging to God and wanting to return to heaven, etc., which made me have no grounding on this planet or sense of common/normal perspective or reference.

174390804,"I think you can certainly improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. I’d suggest not getting angsty, because that can make symptoms worse. For me, when I got angsty and tried to get rid of things out of fear, it was like quicksand. It made things worse. HOWEVER! that’s not to say that you can take steps to get better and reduce symptoms. I’m just saying try not to do it out of fear, panic, and angst. I’d suggest looking into _USER_ID_ (National Alliance of Mental Illness) meetings in your area if you’re in the US. If you’re not in the US, look into support meetings for mental illness in your area. If you’re not on meds already, that’s a good place to start. Meds can really help.

Cerebral cortex is doing that because its wired itself to so try to proceed with your day. When I’m on- medication it happens less / occurs in a way that I can handle. Of course I would recommend medicine.– Worst thing I did on psychosis idk for sure but there was one time I threatened someone with a weapon.–
174390818,"I’m going to agree with _USER_ID_ here. It’s a debilitating disease. While voluntarily suffering as if “taking responsibility” does helps you to grow in some way. Psychosis seems like it’s something else entirely. I could have been an army general in my life if not for psychosis and me getting diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Clearly Psychosis did not helped me to grow in any way, but the opposite has happened. I got sent down to depths of the hell. So in my case Psychosis is the opposite of growth.

174390814,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The genetic relationship between female reproductive traits and six psychiatric disorders. _PERSON_, AT _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Scientific reports , Aug 2019 19 Female reproductive behaviours have important implications for evolutionary fitness and health of offspring. Here we used the second release of UK Biobank data (N?=?220,685) to evaluate the association between five female reproductive traits and polygenic risk scores (PRS) projected from genome-wide association study summary statistics of six psychiatric disorders (N?=?429,178). We found that the PRS of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were strongly associated with age at first birth (AFB) (genetic correlation of -0.68?±?0.03), age at first sexual intercourse (AFS) (-0.56?±?0.03), number of live births (NLB) (0.36?±?0.04) and age at menopause (-0.27?±?0.04). There were also robustly significant associations between the PRS of eating disorder (_NAME_) and AFB (0.35?±?0.06), _NAM
E_ and AFS (0.19?±?0.06), major depressive disorder (MDD) and AFB (-0.27?±?0.07), MDD and AFS (-0.27?±?0.03) and schizophrenia and AFS (-0.10?±?0.03). These associations were mostly explained by pleiotropic effects and there was little evidence of causal relationships. Our findings can potentially help improve reproductive health in women, hence better child outcomes. Our findings also lend partial support to the evolutionary hypothesis that causal mutations underlying psychiatric disorders have positive effects on reproductive success."

I actually first met him in 1978 when I was 17. Later, when I first got clean around 1992 or 1993 I ran into him in a meeting and he had a pretty young wife and a little baby. When I knew him in 1978, I knew his father would beat him up and the father beat his sister too. So when he died I was surprised but I could see a little why he might have done it."

174390828,"Schizophrenia When people ask what schizophrenia is like, I extinguish my voice, silence only answers them. It’s not sepia photos of past lives, not taking timeless pieces of God to eat, taste of Blood-wine on your lips, not pinning you down, stripping your clothes, penis flopping, now tranquilized. Perhaps it’s a kind of crop, not wanting, a fruit of fullness. It doesn’t savor. It’s not chain-smoking, begging to near souls it’s not smuggling caffeine in psych wards, nor dancing at night, raving, to be whole. But if you must know, set holy flames, and see only a mirror while you gaze."

I don’t like taking it because they make me sign something saying I won’t manufacture meth-amphetamines with it. Meth-amphetamines? WTH? That’s the last thing I should be putting in my body. Thing is it really works on your sinuses. So Idk what to do. Anyway, to answer you question, I don’t know why meds cause this, maybe you’re allergic to one of the ingredients."
176189398,"sezbot241: When I was a kid in about 1983 or '84 I was digging in a trash can at a car wash and found a mix tape. On one side was written ‘October’ and on the other side, was written ‘Ghost in The Machine’. I listened to both sides of the tape when I got home. Instantly, recognized the ‘Ghost in the Machine’ side of the tape as _PERSON_ and ‘The Police’ a band I already liked. The ‘October’ side of the tape deeply effected me. It was the first time I heard rock that gave me the same experience as listening to _NAME_ movie sound tracks, where I would have visions and see. While listening to ‘October’ I knew there were 4 members in the band, though I didn’t know who the band was. I also saw them on stage in a place where I had been in my dreams, in a desert like area, with large boulders. There were two dark haired members and two blond hair members. I saw them in a vision while listening. I could never find out for the longest time who the band was. I played that tape until 
it wore out. Then one day about a year or two later, I was at a friends house, he had MTV playing in the background and I heard this band come on, I went to the television set and looked and it was the band I had seen in a vision a year or two earlier and they were playing where I had seen them in the vision, The video was Live At Red Rocks and was 'New Years Day"" I turned to my friend excited and said, “Who are these guys, Is it ‘October’?” He said, “No, that’s U2.”"

174390838,"I’m on risperdal right now and I’ll say that it works better for me than abilify did. It definitely helps with the positive symptoms like lowering voices, paranoia, and clearing up delusions. It does help some with negative symptoms, but my citalopram is what really works for it. But the weight gain is still pretty bad. While it was worse with abilify, I still have increased appetite with risperdal. That’s why I’m probably going to switch to something else if its available. Overall, it’s an ok medication, good for symptoms, but still has that second generation antipsychotic quality to them."

It would be like hacking the electricity + quantum mechanics sort of thing. I feel like despite the craziness and pseudoscientificness of “electric universe theory” it might have some validity if we live in a matrix + quantum is everywhere and I believe is a part of electricty. So there’s that. They didn’t want me to build a simulation and be a computer simulator in a past life. I am no longer that creepy or desperate.

What else could I do to help control the metabolic effects?** Dr. _USER_ID_: In case that metformin is ineffective or the patient does not tolerate it, adjunctive topiramate can be tried.

174390876,"Well I was an independent worker as it was. My mother taught me well and education was very important to them. We were sent to college. I will say that homeschooling isn’t for everyone. If you don’t like to work on your own, and are not much self driven it will not work well. You have to be disciplined and have discipline. I was homeschooled many years ago when It was considered unpopular. The state was much more critical and I had to undergo state testing yearly unlike regular kids. When I went into high school my parents had me join a what we called umbrella school. It was a place you submitted all you high school work and classes and get high school credits that would be accepted by a college. I completed my high school and all high school credits in three years by working very hard. I was able to work ahead unlike regular schools you don’t have that ability really. I was accepted into a private university with a scholarship and graduated with a teaching degree and license. College was a l
ot harder for me because I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in my junior year and had to add a year so I could recover enough to take a full course load. So yes, if you homeschool the right way, you can graduate very easily and get into Ivy League schools. You might have to work harder but you can go far. I am currently homeschooling three of my five kids and I enjoy it. My mother has written many school books for the elementary grade. She was a great teacher. There is a _USER_ID_ that homeschoolers are not allowed to socialize. That is untrue. I was involved in multiple groups of others my age, and I also volunteered in schools as a tutor and teacher assistant. I was also in several orchestras where I was first chair violin at a university and Head chair for two children’s orchestra. I also volunteered at soup drives, homeless shelters, hospitals etc because I had time. Basically I was very involved in my community. My parents made sure I tried lots of things. Many homeschoolers do this. So I feel like I g

176189516,We all stucked in the same problem delusions and hallucinations
176189517,"Yes, it is one of the criteria that defines a delusion. The other criterion is how “realistic” a belief is. I say realistic rather than real or true, because from the perspective of another person, even a real experience of the first person can seem unrealistic, or indeed, “delusional”. For example, I have had an experience of time travel (only a few seconds back), and this would seem doubtful to most people, but it was as real as anything else I’ve experienced in life. Did it in fact happen or did it not? I can’t really answer that question. I believe it was real, but of course I cannot prove it. I can consider different alternatives to interpreting my experiences, without rigidly clinging to my beliefs; this would tend to suggest the beliefs are not of delusional intensity. I don’t have difficulty maintaining multiple mutually contradicting hypotheses. In fact, I have become better at it after my first psychosis. -_NAME_."

174390888,"Wow. Thank you. It’s okay. I suppose we all make assumptions sometimes. Just human nature, I guess. If someone who was mentally well heard a random run of the mill hallucination, and said it was a spirit, then I’d be inclined to believe them. There are things that exist in this world that we don’t yet have definitive proof of. However, a mentally well person who heard voices from their ceiling fan or whatever only when the fan was on would be unlikely to just assume that the voices were spirits and that they were some sort of medium. I’m not saying that it could never happen, but I think that it’s unlikely. When people panic over stuff like that, they tend to think that they have a physical illness that might kill them. That’s what I meant when I said that your thought pattern was illogical."

176189670,"social security talks out of both sides of their mouth. a person could make more or less than the gainful activity amount, 1310, and still be considered either eligible or not eligible. “The biggest factor in determining if work qualifies as SGA is the amount a person is paid. In 2020, someone is generally considered to be engaging in SGA if he or she earns more than $1,260 ($2,110 for blind SSDI recipients) So, for example, if you are making, say, $200 per week doing part-time work, you would not be working over the SGA limit. However, this isn’t a cut and dry issue. If you are working a lot, it’s possible for the SSA to determine that your job duties constitute SGA even if you are earning less than the SGA amount.” www.disabilitysecrets.com What Will Cause Your Social Security Disability Benefits to Stop? a person is allowed to deduct their expenses related to their disability, so that might help me a little, but i have never gone to the extent of giving them all that info. it’s the sam

I always thought it would work best as needs-based and depending on your income earnings fade off, or if you’re disabled stay the same? Financial freedom would be a blessing in the USA. Right now it’s just a bunch of people at the top calling the shots, but that has potential to change and become more progressive. I believe healthcare should be a human right, everyone should have access to affordable care. The system is not so bad, but there is a lot that could improve. With inflation, well the gov. is printing money so they are flooding the system with money but they called the interest rates as Fixed? So that means the systems being kept stable and prices won’t change, meaning no inflation? Or does that mean the opposite? They don’t predict too much inflation from what I read, that the markets will be about the same with a dip in two years and then re-stabilize. I have also read fears of bitcoin crashing the dollar, but I think 
that’s all hype. I dont have any bits of coins lol. Too risky and volatile and I don’t have enough to gamble on it. The rich are getting richer and the disadvantage can’t keep up, we are heading for an inevitable economic system which is unsustainable whichever way you put it due to all the reckless spending and national debts. I’m only sorta beginning to understand this stuff, but if we don’t have a way to take care of people, keep them housed and future generations youth etc. they won’t be competing with anything, as a lot of labor jobs are being automated away…and a lot of manual jobs don’t pay enough as it is, the whole system needs to shift, everyone should have chances."

Maybe it was in a dream or wasn’t real. I just dont know. I hope to be alive and have a long life after i take the cure/vaccine. I have no clue what causes schizophrenia. If it ain’t the norovirus, then I guess I’m screwed anyways and will have to adapt or die like they say. I have to recover.

Because,the hallucinations is form both of the cause structure and functional cause of the condition you call it schizophrenia ,it is the substance and root origin of the whole condition that you call it SZ Therefore,it is supposed that,you do not take the course of sz’s symptoms as an argument or/ identical aspects with the symptoms of any genetic disease or mental illness,and then incorrectly adhere to the assumption that these symptoms of sz are the product of a disease or illness ,because when you go to search for a genetic cause for the whole condition or its symptoms you will find nothing ! Just look very carefully at the thing called hallucination,know what is it ,then match that with the existential features of this thing as the person 
feels,perceives,coexists with and deal with it moment by moment all period time of wakefulness After that ,you are free to ask; Is there a human gene /genome that has creation properties that make it capable of creating the thing called hallucination ? The most a gene can create is to make a copy of itself /make proteins Could this or that create the hallucination ?

176189714,"Hey. I just wanted you to know that I’ve had similar experiences of voices in my head mocking me and my morality or where voices told me I was going to hell or where I was just a plain piece of ????. It’s hard to get through. I think the turning point of all of my voices (not to say they still don’t bother me) is to remember that they are all constructs of my mind and therefore not real in the sense that I am talking to you. I hope this makes sense to you or helps you in any way. If you need to talk I am open. Again, sorry you are going through this, I feel for you. Have a good day"
176189715,I don’t believe these voices are real so when it seems like they’re trying to talk to other people it seems like it’s another thing they’re doing to make me you think they’re real.

And it seems like they’re doing all sorts of things to get your attention.

176189725,"I can’t sleep in the living room anymore. I slept in here for two months because I thought the neighbors were messing with me in my bedroom. Above me, and on the other side of me. The property manager told me that it’s a lease violation to sleep in the common area so I went back to sleeping in my room about 4 days ago. And the first night went OK. But now for the third night in a row, I wake up at 2:00 am or 3:00 am tossing and turning, and with a huge stress headache. I toss and turn for 15 minutes and cannot fall back asleep. So I will not lay down here in the living room but I will sit up for a few more hours until I fall asleep sitting up. To be honest, the neighbors control me like a puppet. I discovered the brat punks, two doors down have been controlling me without my knowledge. They get the reaction they want when they squeal like little girls. I know you guys may not know what it’s like to be controlled but I’ve been thinking I’ve been fighting back but in reality, I’m so easy 
to control that the neighbors do it simply now with just a barely audible laugh. IDK how I grew up like this. I was pretty cool as a kid and a teenager. i had lots of friends until I hit ninth grade. I started isolating but after a short period with no friends when I first entered high school, i made a few friends and after school let out I had really cool friends in my neighborhood. I did everything normal kids did: I fished, rode bikes with my friends, played around with slingshots, flew kites, built model airplanes joined Little League. I mean my life as a kid was right out of a _NAME_ painting. And I hit high school and pretty soon the big kid across the street got to use his parents car and then we were going to parties, and malls and cruising around and sneaking into drive-in movies. Don’t get me wrong, I was pathologically shy and withdrawn but I was just cool enough able to hang out with cool people and do whatever they did. And now I’m being treated like a punk. It’s tearing up my self-esteem a
nd confidence. When you have five year old’s controlling you and getting the best of you in almost every turn it tends to sap your energy. I know this is kid stuff and I try to take responsibility for how I ended up but I still kinda wonder what my family did to me. I’ve been a second class citizen for a long time. And now people who I don’t even like are wrecking my stay here. But I need my sleep, I’ve caught the neighbors red handed messing with me and now I’m off track and I don’t exactly know what their trip is. Someone on here said my neighbors are people who want to be “Big fish in a little pond.” Pretty much sums it up. This sleep thing is disturbing me."

The best fire I ever seen was when I was in high school and part of my school burned. The first fire I remember was when I was 7 or 8, in the woods near my home.

I really struggled with the human interaction part of it . I lasted a week or so.

176189826,"Hello. We typically do not make a policy of sharing the reasons members get banned publicly, besides the customary two or three words the forum software requires. This is because we try to use suspensions as a means of restoring peace to the forum, and not as a tool for public shaming. We try to let everyone start over with a clean slate once they come back without letting their past actions haunt their future ability to make good decisions. We are deciding to make an exception for one specific user, because of the special circumstances involved. _AT_MENTION_ has given us his approval to do so. The user _AT_MENTION_ has a long history of lying to and manipulating other users, and convincing them to go off their meds. They have been warned about this repeatedly, and we have patiently tried to explain why their actions are harmful to others here. They have repeatedly refused to listen, and instead accuse us of discriminating against them for not using meds. I hope you all know that we have many users 
here who don’t take meds, and we don’t discriminate against any of them. The reason Noise gets warned so often is because they have repeatedly encouraged people to quit their meds. The most notable example of this was user _NAME_. For those of you who were here a year ago, you know just how bad things got for him after Noise convinced him to stop his meds. He ended up making that video and deleting his account, and nobody has heard from him ever since. This is the reason Noise was suspended for a year. For actively destroying the life of someone who had been productive and functional. Not because we were discriminating against them. Since coming back, they have repeatedly continued lying to and manipulating other members, trying to convince them that we are unfairly attacking them for no reason. This tends to lead to us getting many angry PMs from other users who are angry at us about the way they think we have treated Noise. We are hoping to cut those off at the head this time, by making it very clear th
at the reason we have suspended them this time is for their pattern of aggressive, manipulative, and harmful behavior. Not because of any personal feelings. I hope that my nearly five years on this site can speak for itself. I have a history of being fair and level headed, I hope this holds true for the rest of the mod team and _AT_MENTION_ as well. We came to this decision together, and we did not do so lightly. We have a long history of trying to make this a safe and recovery-oriented place for everyone. I hope you can all remember that. Thank you."

176189829,Tattoos are so mainstream these days. Over here full sleeves aren’t unusual. As to scars. Say it was a compound fracture or something. Most people will accept things at face value most of the time. As to ideas…plenty of solid coverups that look good. I’m no expert but something you like and a good tattoo artist helps.

I would get a different education from attending the college down the road then I would get from attending Harvard or Yale or Stanford."
174390986,The problem is that they can’t help us as there is no meds for negative symptoms. That’s why 85% are unemployed with some living in the streets.

174390985,I think that CBD is today’s new snake oil. It’s touted as being a cure all for every ailment under the sun. The truth is that it’s most likely useless for psychotic disorders like schizophrenia other than maybe helping with some anxiety. I don’t really trust the stuff either.

174390992,"I can’t sleep with Abilify on its own, it doesn’t do as good a job at controlling my positive symptoms, my agitation, or mood on its own, I augment the Zyprexa with memantine because when you combine memantine with Clozaril or Zyprexa it helps even more with positive symptoms so I would relapse without the Zyprexa. I have been on Clozaril because my schizophrenia is treatment resistant, but I cannot tolerate it properly, so I figured Abilify+memantine+Zyprexa is the next best thing."
176189866,you can also ask for reports made by your old pdoc to give them to your new pdoc… then he/she can read about you and then you don’t need to tell everything again… but when meeting new pdoc you will prob go over everything anyways i think.

It wasn’t difficult to obfuscate the truth because I already had solid experience as a software developer so I could easily come up with detailed lies, if need be. But not everyone has that luxury. Some of us have never finished high school, let alone graduate from uni. Some of us have never had a paid job. If that were the case for me, I would probably be in a very difficult position, with low self-esteem and high avoidance of “dangerous” social exposure. I would live a secluded life and keep to myself. And that would probably be a mistake. Cause everyone is good at SOMETHING. Everyone has skills and hobbies based on said skills. And we all need social contact. Some more than others. Joining an online club or fan group or something similar is a first step.

176189931,Both of my parents are dead. My father died about 7 years ago and about 2 weeks later I found my mother dead. They had been divorced for 45 years. Growing up I never had a relationship with my dad. When I was in my twenties my step mother died and my dad took me to a bar to get drunk. On the way home he was arrested for DUI. The next morning when he got out of jail he tried to sleep with me. I hate my dad. There’s other things but I don’t want to go into them. My mother worked hard to raise 4 kids on her own. She never complained. She was a great mom even though she was emotionally absent who could blame her with all the work she had to do. As a teen with undiagnosed mental health issues I had problems with my mother and blamed her parenting for my difficulties. It took many years to repair our relationship when I got older. In the long run I feel better prepared to handle life because of having an intelligent and strong role model for a mother . My mother had her flaws but I miss her every sing

That means no hexing and black magic. Others follow the rule “do as thou wilt, harm none lest it return 3 times 3” Still others follow “Do as thou wilt” And then you have those that just do rituals and spells as a form of meditation without following any religious aspect. Witchcraft has as many paths to follow as branches of Christianity. Everyone is different in how they practice."

174390997,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Anti-inflammatory Strategies for Schizophrenia: A Review of Evidence for Therapeutic Applications and Drug Repurposing. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology, Feb 29 2020 Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a substantial socioeconomic and humanistic burden. Currently available treatment strategies mostly rely on antipsychotic drugs, which block dopaminergic effects in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. Although antipsychotic drugs help relieve psychotic symptoms, a definitive cure for schizophrenia has yet to be achieved. Recent advances in neuroinflammation research suggest that proinflammatory processes in the brain could cause alterations in neurobehavioral development and increase vulnerability to schizophrenia. With a growing need for novel strategies in the treatment of schizophrenia, it would be meaningful to review the current evidence sup
porting the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory strategies. This review details the key findings of clinical trials that investigate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents as adjuvants to antipsychotic treatment. We further discuss the possibilities of repurposing anti-inflammatory agents and developing novel strategies for the treatment of schizophrenia. http://www.cpn.or.kr/journal/view.html?volume=18&number=1&spage=10 Full free text"

The double-blind RCT demonstrated no significant difference in improvement in polydipsia between olanzapine and haloperidol. Two single-arm trials showed that polydipsia improved during clozapine treatment, whereas the other two showed that risperidone did not improve polydipsia. The cross-sectional study showed the prevale
nce of hyponatremia with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs: 26.1%) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs: 4.9%). Two case series reported clozapine improved polydipsia; the other one indicated that patients with polydipsia who were treated with FGAs had schizophrenia (70.4%) and mental retardation (25.9%). Of 90 cases in the case reports, 67 (75.3%) were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Of 83 cases in which antipsychotic treatment started before the onset of polydipsia, 75 (90.3%) received FGAs, particularly haloperidol (n?=?24, 28.9%), and 11 (13.3%) received risperidone. Among 40 cases in which polydipsia was improved following antipsychotic treatment, 36 (90.0%) received SGAs, primarily clozapine (n?=?14, 35.0%).Although the causal relationship between polydipsia and antipsychotics remains unclear because of the paucity of high-quality studies, antipsychotics with high affinity to dopamine D2 receptors may be associated with increased risk of polydipsia while clozapine may be effective for treating p
olydipsia."

Increases or imbalances in cytokines before birth or during childhood may impact neurodevelopment and produce vulnerability to schizophrenia. The specificity of inflammatory abnormalities in psychiatric disorders is controversial. Similar increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines have been described in 
other disorders, especially mood and anxiety disorders. One of the most important challenges at this point is the understanding of neurobiological correlates of prodromal stages of schizophrenia.Although future research should investigate the exact role of different cytokines in pathophysiology of schizophrenia, these mediators emerge as promising molecular targets to its prevention and treatment."

176190173,"_AT_MENTION_ That is the answer I would say too, except the very end of the post you said, “until you face them yourself.” I would not want anyone to have to face some of what I had. Maybe it would be better to change the last part to, “but can try to understand.”"

176190206,I don’t follow you but my first stay in the mental hospital put me over the edge. There was an investigation into my wife’s drinking when she went to rehab and all kind of strange things started happening and made me paranoid. When I was hospitalized they keep showing news casts about a major hurricane heading to New _USER_ID_ where my wife was in rehab. They looked like they were made in someone’s garage. There was no hurricane. I have googled it. They had fake stories in the newspaper too that were indirectly about me and my life. Those are just a few examples. They went to a lot of trouble to get in my psyche. I was terrified and paranoid and afraid to talk for six years. It was miserable. They don’t seem to bother me anymore though and they pay me a lot of money in retirement and disability. It doesn’t make sense at all.

176190230,Is this the truth? Are you really being sent to one or do you want more attention? I was in a crisis center as a teen for a while. I received a lot of therapy at that time. I slept a lot because I was so exhausted. I was only allowed to attend school for 3 hours a day. I did the rest of my work independently. I eventually got out. I was emancipated

176190233,If PTSD is what troubling you then you need to stop thinking about that past bad incidents. Distract your mind by doing some other things. Get busy so no time to think etc. You are allowing your mind to think about the past and thats why you feeling bad. When you see some boring TV channel what you do. Yes you instantly change the channel using remote. Same way when you get sad thoughts manually force yourself to think about some other or start doing some other activity. If you nto do anything that PTSD thoughts just over floods your mind.

Neuromuscular diseases are very different from CF, but CF is a very tough disease in its own aspect. I hope she is doing ok.

176190235,I gained 40 lbs a month and a half. Had to stop taking it.
176190236,"But, made it to my shrink and on the way home, I stopped at this cool store to mainly pick up some strawberries. They describe themselves as a Farmers Market but it’s all indoors. They have a good selection and I like to browse their bins. They sell bulk food like chocolate covered almonds or dried Turkish apricots or steel cut oatmeal or flax seeds. They have like 40 bins filled with exotic, varied things. And they have shelves and shelves of fancy chocolate covered everything. And they sell groceries too. The strawberries are cheaper than any place I normally go like Safeway, Lucky, Nob Hill, or Smart & Final. Two pounds for $1.98. That’s all I walked in for but I saw they sell blueberries ridiculously cheap too so since they are healthiest fruit for you I got about a pound of those too. Blueberries contain anti-toxidents that prevent cancer. And I bought a hunk of some exotic cheese. Some lady ahead of me in line was bugging me for some reason, giving me unfriendly looks so I glared at her a
nd made her feel uncomfortable. And there was some friendly teenage girl who seemed nice but I guess she didn’t like me either. Me and the cashier had a nice conversation so screw the first two, I’m crossing both of them off my Christmas card list this year until they shape up and be civil. My sister gave me a gift card to a restaurant for walking her dog and keeping him company a couple of weeks ago ( I would do it for free but I didn’t want to insult her so I took the card) And I passed the restaurant so I pulled in and now I have a Turkey Club sitting in the refrigerator for dinner later.

However, functional organization of white matter (WM) in chronic schizophrenia remains unclear.To investigate the WM functional alterations in chronic never-treated schizophrenia and the effects of long-term antipsychotic treatment.Prospective.Twenty-five never-treated, 41 matched antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia, and 25 healthy comparison subjects.Resting state (rs)-fMRI, T1 -weighted images (T1 WI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) covering the whole brain were acquired with a 3.0T scanner.Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in WM and the correla
tion coefficients between WM and GM were examined and compared among the three participant groups by two reviewers independently. Independent component analysis (ICA) was added to evaluate WM-fMRI signals. Statistical Tests: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); Pearson correlation analysis.Never-treated patients demonstrated lower ALFF in splenium of corpus _USER_ID_ (SCC) relative to treated patients and controls (P < 0.001, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected). While the extracted independent component also located in SCC and showed significantly decreased connectivity in never-treated patients when compared to controls (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected). The correlation coefficients of WM-GM displayed greater reductions in the genu of corpus _USER_ID_ (GCC), pontine crossing tract (PC), bilateral cingulum (hippocampus) (CGH), and bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) in treated patients relative to controls (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected).These findings provide new insight into WM functional alterations over the long-term cou
rse of schizophrenia with and without the potential effects of antipsychotic medication. Functional change and abnormal connectivity in SCC were both found greater in untreated patients than treated patients relative to healthy controls, suggesting that long-term antipsychotic treatment may show some protective effects on WM functional organization.3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

They pretty much told me not to post such things on Facebook and that there’s a lot of _USER_ID_ and nothing you talk about. My mum still refuses to believe in or accept my diagnosis. It took me over twenty years to say I have schizophrenia. I wanted to come “out of the closet “ but the family I’m living with said the whole world doesn’t have to know and it’s good to have privacy. I probably would tell people if it wasn’t for my family being against it. A man recently asked why I’m on the pension and I replied I rather not talk about it because it’s so tabu to say schizophrenia and my family would be angry at me if I told him and he was being a bit nosy perhaps .

I’m sorry you fear something bad is going to happen. I always fear the worst is going to happen. It is a natural thing that happens to AA members some times. But when It affects how you deal with it… Maybe you can talk it out with someone. You could learn to trust a little bit that no one is watching and trust yourself when you know the stove is off.

174391117,"I want to express how I ended up with schizoaffective, but in a manner which is slightly abridged but also to include how medications were involved. In 2008, I was diagnosed with either unspecified or generalized anxiety disorder. Later that year, my doc put me on Zoloft/Sertraline, and it made me act slightly suicidal and violent. When I would return to appointments, she often asked me if I was hearing voices, but I said I wasn’t, because I didn’t know if they were thoughts or actually voices, because I could only hear them with my mind, not my ears. After bothering me many times about it, I finally said I was hearing voices, and she referred me to another doctor who, a few weeks or months later, added Seroquel/Quetiapine to the mix. This combo made me even more violent, but it seemed to quiet the “voices.” In 2013, due to a change of insurance companies, my doctor that I had since 2009 or so, called me and told me to stop the Seroquel, so I stopped it after a few weeks. In the fall of 201
3, I weaned myself off of Zoloft, and was finally off of medications altogether. I had been hospitalized two times for being a threat by destroying household items since I started Zoloft and Seroquel. After I stopped the medications, I gradually became less and less violent, but in 2014, my anxiety and OCD symptoms came back, so I was unable to continue my Computer Science degree in community college, so I took Automotive Technology instead. In 2016, I had insomnia and anxiety for several months due to being exposed to mold and finally went back to the doc, and I told her that I was afraid of having sz, and told her that I thought I was hearing voices, but she told me they were just thoughts, and said I only have anxiety. I also had a new therapist with whom I agreed that I would take medications again and change my major back to Computer Science, so I did. In 2017, I changed my doc, and this one put me on Zoloft, as per my suggestion. I suggested it, because in the back of my head, I knew it gave me a cognit
ive boost in the past. I had done my research and found that Zoloft is considered to be a weak DRI (dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although it is mainly an SSRI. After taking it for the first time in more than 3 years, at 50 mg, I heard “voices,” and after taking it for a few weeks, it made me slightly more paranoid and delusional, but it gave me the ability to concentrate, so I kept taking it. In late April of 2017, my doctor, who I changed back to, put me on 75 mg, which made me more alpha, irritated, and delusional. It even made me repeatedly yell at my mom angrily. In the summer of 2017, my mom threatened to kick me out, so I scrambled to get a job, even when I was going to summer school, so my anxiety and stress levels skyrocketed. On the day of my job interview, I arrived late, to the wrong building, and after a worker telling me that I was at the wrong place, I started to do donuts in the parking lot, after which I was arrested. When I was in jail, I told the psychiatrist there about my medication h
istory, diagnosis of anxiety, and my prescription of Zoloft, so she put me back on it after several days of not taking it as a result of being in jail. This time however, after a few days being back in my jail cell, I constantly yelled and showed symptoms of delusions and hallucinations, which the nurses noted and reported to my pdoc. My insomnia came back, and I finally had ongoing audible voices. After a few days or so, the nurses gave me liquid medication which I thought was still Zoloft, but was actually Risperdal/Risperidone. After a few months, my pdoc told me I was on Risperdal, and I finally realized that I was “tricked.” In January of 2018, I was released from jail, but no longer had the cognitive boost that resulted in taking Zoloft. Even worse, when I look back, I feel that I lost 10-15 IQ points (I had a report from the pdoc in 2011 that I had an IQ of 108, if I remember correctly). In 2018, several months after my release, my new pdoc told me that I was either schizoaffective or bipolar. It t
ruly wasn’t worth it going back to Zoloft just to pursue my dreams of finishing with a degree in Computer Science. Has anyone on these forums ever taken Zoloft or another medication which worsened psychosis as a result?"

Mine is Get up, have a morning cigarette (Monday, wednesday and friday I shower after this and change my clothes) Put on clothes brush teeth have morning coffee go to work and when I get home from work, I make dinner. I know too well the overwheling feeling of “I don’t want to”, but the more you let yourself get away with that behaviour, the harder it is to break it. When you think about it, showering and brushing your teeth isn’t that hard, and doesn’t have to take long. It’s way easier if you know “okay, it’s 9am, now I need to brush” or “Okay, today is wednesday, time to shower” And especially if you make yourself do it before you can do whatever you usually do to pass time or have fun. In denmark, they say “Man må yde før man kan nyde”, which means you have to do your duties before you can do fun things."

174391131,Welcome! Here is a liittle tip for you regarding the voices. Remember that the voices are part of your subconscious mind vocalised. How you feel about yourself and presuming what other people think about you is reflected in the voices. There is nothing alien or supernatural about them at all. The people who believe that have a history of sci-fi or religious indoctrination in their life history. Schizophrenia deviates the normal thinking into patterns based on your previous psyche. Once you understand that the voices are only guesses of what other people think and reflections of how you feel about yourself at any given moment you can gain insight and learn to manage it better. Good luck on your journey and welcome once again!

176190354,Is it nicotine cessation or just smoking? That might be worth it to go on it right there. I think I may have quit smoking on it before.
176190355,"I definitely agree that environment affects development. I grew up in a very abusive home. At 19 I was taken from a party and held against my will for 3 months. Then I married an abusive man and stayed with him for 15 years. Just now my life is better with my new husband. I thank God for him every day. I’m pretty sure that’s why I come across as serious, and why I’m so paranoid. I started being followed in 2008. That has made me paranoid."
176190356,That’s exactly it. I feel like idk what he is capable of towards me like I’m some vulnerable person you can toss around and do whatever to. I’m afraid cos he once said he has temptations to join gangs cos he is in a very bad financial situation. This only makes me feel more uneasy if he has ‘dodgy’ people that he may talk twisted stuff to about me. Idk what kind of people his friends are and how they may react to things he may say about me. But at the end of the day I think involving the police will maybe provoke something worse in him. Honestly. I don’t think I wanna go there and step on his toes. His last message to me was more gentle. Maybe he realised how twisted his things were that he is messaging me. I just want this to die off.

Risperidone and amisulpride have both worked for me but have raised my prolactin level - is high prolactin a problem?

176190393,There’s too many traumatic things that happen in this World and too small of a percentage of people with schizophrenia for that to ever make sense. Trauma may be an environmental trigger for someone who is genetically prone to schizophrenia but it doesn’t do it by itself.

174391143,I have a lot of news feeds related to schizophrenia and every few days there’s a big story about a violent schizophrenic doing something bad. Or really bad. The reality is that Schizophrenia can make people dangerous. I think we live in a bubble here on schizophrenia.com in a way.

176190419,"Having sz/sza definitely moves the threshold for becoming overwhelmed. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate that you didn’t used to have, and it’s pushing you beyond your limits a bit. I don’t like the idea of upping medicines, I think it would be a better idea to find a way to require less of yourself by addressing the mother in law issue, but it sounds like that’s not a possibility. Most of us dealing with sz/sza aren’t thrust into a caregiver role like this. At least I know that if it were me, I would get overwhelmed and backslide a bit. I am amazed you manage. Someone needs to step in and help you out though ideally. I really do wish you the best, hope things go well somehow."
176190420,"Yes, when I was new here (15 years ago) and quite delusional, one of the dogs definitely didn’t like me. He’s still here and so am I . As a matter of fact, I’m the one who feeds him.

174391162,"I’m on a cto so no choice of switching but maybe eventually reducing would rather be free of medication, I was getting along okay and functional for years. I just had a terrible mental health team who blew everything out of proportion based on a past episode many years ago and were constantly looking for any tiny sign of psychosis, even lying in reports."
174391164,"I have been mis-treated by psychiatry and I will no longer play their game. The drugs will be hard to come off I know, but I think it’s worth the effort. Each reduction that’s successful is a small victory for me"
176190422,I’m good at making schedules but bad at following them. So I don’t really have one. I eat when I’m hungry and shower when I need one. And go to bed any time between 10pm and 1am
174391158,I tried abilify for a while. I got akathesia really bad when first taking it but it left after a while. Never did pan out for me but I’d say depends on how long you’ve been on it. Side effects may be early but not so bad after a while but we are all so different…
176190423,About 4 months before I have a bad episode and land in the hospital.
176190424,"I can relate to my condition being downplayed. My sister on several occasions, has downplayed my schizophrenia and brain injury as if it were nothing. I had a heart attack about a year ago, as a result of my seizures. But the heart attack happened because of an electrical discharge from my brain, rather than the usual blocked arteries. She blew it off as nothing, simply because it wasn’t the norm. That’s like saying I got shot in the chest with a hunting Arrow, rather than a gun so I feel nothing and there’s no danger or harm … It irks me, but I need to accept other people’s point of view. It’s theirs, not mine. It still hurts though, I get it"

Would you ever pretend to be alienated by him? You know, just to elevate your own self esteem and “have a time” with others? Because we’re already pretending he’s one color right?

174391166,"Sounds like it. My thought disorder is like me accessing thousands or more parallel universes with my mind, similarly to how a quantum computer works, I guess. Like in a past life I remember telling these alien types (looked like holographic pharaohs) that I have ADHD and needed some type of medication like adderall because I can access parallel universes with my mind. I guess you can say I’m an ET contactee, unfortunately, I guess. We are like ants or cattle to them in my opinion. Even when they help us, it’s scary. Not sure they can even cure my schizophrenia if they wanted to. It’s hard to tell what’s real, what happened, what will happen (future), etc. Most likely if I had ADHD meds the common opinion is it would make me even crazier…but it could also work and make me smarter and a happier man and it could change me life for the better. It’s worth the risk to me. After all, they gave me all these other stupid meds I didn’t need or didn’t work."

176190459,Thank you _PERSON_. I’ve never looked at it that way before. But it’s very true what you just shared. I can’t help but wonder if survival is all we’re meant to do. I mean that and bear fruit to perpetuate the species. Perhaps anything beyond that is just secondary. Idk. Maybe. Maybe not.

176190462,_AT_MENTION_ what I more mean is like I used to feel my mind was empty/blank. Then I got supplied with delusions. They made me more attune to the universe and whats going on and fill my mind with things. Sure some of it affected me way negatively. But in the long term its better than my 20 year old very young pre-developed self who wasn’t very aware of much going on and therefore it was more delusional to be that way than to believe in synchronicity and stuff.

174391178,I hide them well. My parents sometimes can’t tell what’s going on. But I just kinda stare into space cause everything starts looking like a certain shape in my head.

176190469,My doc told me that risperidone is used off label for adhd which might be the source of clarity. I think on risperidone sometimes I hyperfocus and think too fast and that causes me to mix up words. Which might be like disorganized thinking?

176190487,Mostly negative. It was fun selling joints and cutting classes though. My freshman year sucked big time but each year got a little better.
176190488,"They have drugged me!! I got very dizzy towards the end of my cycle, my face was still Stingy from wiping it as well, perhaps they put something on the handlebars. The voices were also talking at the same time taking credit for it, it was _NAME_, I also think it’s _NAME_ giving me messages on the phone. Im thinking they can control my body and make me feel anything like the voices said, maybe the voices were real and RNM or whatever it’s called is real and they can control minds, that’s the only explanation for it, I never got dizzy before. Or perhaps they changed my medicine or something. Really thinking the whispers I hear are actually from the _NAME_ and they just can’t put them up loud for some reason. They want to turn me into a couch potatoe so il get really fat and become a diabetic or something, the plan for me is to turn me into a very low functioning human bean. They know I love exercise and want to take that away from me."
176190489,That’s too bad. I think it would help you sell it

176190505,"Some guys love snakes and want to keep them, but a snake is not my idea of a cuddly pet. I don’t like to get to near them, but I’m not terrified of them. I’ve gotten a pretty close look at a few water moccasins and a few copperheads. My grandad had this stock pond that was over run with snakes. Sometimes I would put on heavy boots and get his double barrel shotgun and about twenty shells, and I would go down to his stock pond and kill about ten snakes. One time when we were little we were fishing at my grandad’s pond. A copperhead was swimming right by the bank in front of us, but we didn’t know it was a poisonous snake. My sister’s friend dangled her hook with a minnow on it right in front of the snake. It’s a good thing the snake didn’t try to eat it. Later on that day we saw a couple of other copperheads up on the bank. I think it was their mating season. I didn’t know we’d messed with a poisonous snake until I was older."

174391199,No I faked bipolar I think and they told me I was bipolar or schizoaffective. Now I’m still considered schizoaffective. So they didn’t see through anything. Because I still have the same diagnosis as the one I thought I faked. I still didn’t make up any of the symptoms. I still had them. That’s why I don’t know why I think I faked it. Since I didn’t make up my symptoms. It’s weird.

Whenever I’m in hospital he is shocked by my symptoms, but I have trouble disclosing to him when I see him as an outpatient. I’m afraid of rapid cyclic, I find it more distressing than the delusions and hallucinations. Probably because I get irritable mania and mixed states and that just sucks. Plus I really loose insight.

174391176,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Achieving the Lowest Effective Antipsychotic Dose for Patients with Remitted Psychosis: A Proposed Guided Dose-Reduction Algorithm. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, CNS drugs , Nov 2019 18 Continuing antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia under clinical remission remains controversial. Even though the mainstream opinion declares an outweighed balance against medication discontinuation, recent reviews and critiques suggest that some patients may remain symptom free and well functioning after stopping antipsychotics, but few predictors can identify who can try medication discontinuation, whilst no guidelines exist for reducing medication to reach the lowest effective dose safely. Analyzing the findings from studies employing different methodologies, adopting evidence from pharmacodynamic research, and observing dose reduction in stable patients, as well as taking inspiration from the metaphor of the _PERSON_ set in natural philosophy, we introduce an alternative solution and pr
opose a guided dose-reduction algorithm that follows a set of clear precautions and instructions. The algorithm recommends only a fraction (no more than 25%) of the dosage to be reduced at a time, with at least a 6-month stabilization period required before reducing another 25% of the dose. Patients are empowered to actively participate in decision making when they are ready for further dose tapering, or should they retreat to a previous dosage if warning signs of a relapse re-emerge. An intermittent or irregular dosing schedule can be used to adapt this algorithm to real-world practice. Our preliminary findings suggest that patients with remitted psychosis can do well along this path. We anticipate that this approach can help optimize the risk-benefit ratio and instill a hope in patients with schizophrenia that they can maintain in stable remission under a lower antipsychotic dose without an increased risk of relapse."

174391188,"I had a horrible childhood. Frankly, the reason why I developed complex PTSD is because of my long exposure to trauma. My mother had a rocky relationship with my father because my father did not care for the family but rather went to study. So, she was extremely stressed- she put the anger on me, and I was constantly lashed out and blamed for “acting like a child”. I was afraid of getting in the car after I went out with my mother because she would tell me all the bad things I’ve done at the outing after I got in the car. After that, I was abused at school and bullied because I was a top A student. That would make me at least 9 or so years with abuse. I was diagnosed when I was 17, so yes I was diagnosed quite early. As a child, I was really distant from others but seen as a “kind child”. A lot of my identity was distorted by abuse so now I’m not even sure who I am."

176190620,I’m not diagnosed with schizophrenia either. But I don’t know what they base it on. Why do they tell you that you don’t have schizophrenia? I never asked my doctor why he doesn’t think I have schizophrenia.
176190621,ive done both before. went by myself and went b/c of family

176190628,"_NAME_ picking studies isn’t going to help you figure this out, _AT_MENTION_ . If you’re serious about reading up on the science behind this, you need to start with the most recent _NAME_-analyses and review articles. Regular studies like the one you posted are really only relevant after you’ve read and compared all the relevant _NAME_-analyses and reviews. And that means getting access to the full papers and really comprehending them, not just reading the abstracts. The short version is this: Reduced brain size does not necessarily mean reduced brain function (it could be a healthy reorganization), and at any rate, the effect size is small. The meds do seem to improve cognition in the short term. The long-term effect is, as it always is, less studied, but we can assume the effect is small here as well."

176190640,"I personally think it’s very difficult to malinger true psychosis. I spent years convinced I was a malingerer. I was convinced my pdoc thought I was a malingerer and had it written down in my notes. I seen all my files going back 9 years and learned I didn’t malingerer it. They didn’t think that either. The thought I was a malingerer was part of the illness. I still am convinced when I become unwell. Thing is - If you read all the information on the net on how to to malinger psychosis you wouldn’t be able to pull it off. Especially a 15 year old. There are lots of subtle signs. People who fake psychosis over exaggerate symptoms, they’re not atypical. They have a gain they want. Yes attention seeking can be a gain but I highly doubt a 15 year old can pull that off. A decent pdoc will see straight through it 100%…! I believe _AT_MENTION_-Cotton has a mental illness."

I could recall hearing voices since I was a teenager, and I didn’t know why I was hearing them. I just tried to avoid my hallucinations as much as I can. But I couldn’t avoid them, which led me to continue harming myself and locking myself up etc. Also substances can be really triggering his mental health- so it’s good that you are keeping his credit/debit card away.

174391224,Hi there and welcome to the forum family I have schizoaffective too and also had symptoms since I was 13.
174391228,I like aripiprazole. When I first started on it I didn’t really think I had a good time in life and that was therefore exacerbated by aripiprazole. But now it is better. It may just have been that I’m very sensitive to higher doses of it. Though. But hopefully it was just cos I was not at a good point in my life which is why I couldn’t cope well on 15mg. Id suggest you start on the lowest dose of abilify and give that a chance first?

However if caffeine makes you anxious there is good chance a stimulant might make you anxious as well. I heard an apple can wake you up as much as a cup of coffee can but i never tried it. I once had mint leaves put in water recommended to me as well for a caffeiene alternative but again didn’t try it.

I only started talking abilify to be a circuit breaker. As in I would not do much, be called unreasonable and moody. Motivation was little. Nothing around me attracted me. So I was once again, showing very little affection to my family. I came out of the hospital extremely grateful to be out. Getting along with my mom. But two years later(not on meds). Was not the same amount of affection between us. Seeing flaws in the ones around us. Not mentioning wanting more out of the relationships. Made me edgy. So that is why I started taking Abilify again. You can say I never believed that being medicated was of necessity. I take it because the people around me see that I was not motivated. They did not see that I wanted more out of my relationships. Although, I felt they thought I wanted too much of them. I can say after been on abilify for four ye
ars. Much is the same between my relationship. I still feel its flawed, as its hard to communicate with someone that’s always playing on their phones. Pandemic has stop me from doing much. So no progression. Just coming up to the ten year mark of being first hospitalized. So want some change/proof that I am still doing good. Thanks for sharing some of your experiences."

My dad hates most people that don’t work but he plays chess with a genius who doesn’t work and likes him and he doesn’t think I should work because he thinks I should avoid stress. HE used to think I should work part time but he changed his mind when I tried working and ended up in hospital . He is ok with me being on the pension and volunteering a bit I think.

176190737,I’ve been taking a course in distant learning. Completed it yesterday. Was some stress attached to it because of deadlines. Turned it my last assignment 2 days before the end.
176190738,"But my step-dad really pissed me off earlier today. I’m pretty easygoing and tolerant as anyone in my family would tell you but I said something innocently funny and he picked that moment to belabor the point. Ironically, me, my sister and my step-dad were talking about the ink blot test (the _PERSON_ test for mentally ill people? Something like that). That conversation ended but after a pause I told them that most of the time when I was evaluated to get in a hospital a psychiatrist would ask me start counting backwards by 7’s from a hundred. Or they would ask me what is the meaning of the old saying “People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones?” Another popular question is to name the last 7 presidents going backwards from the current president (in my first psyche ward it started at _NAME_!!) to the older ones. They also asked me if I knew what year it was and what day of the week it was. I always aced these tests, never got one wrong except my last hospitalization three years ago when 
I wasn’t sure what day it was. But during all my hospitalizations in the 1980’s I never got one wrong and impressed the doctors. But I told my sister and step-dad this just to be funny and let them know one of the trivial quirks of being hospitalized which they wouldn’t know otherwise. My sister was amused but my step-dad picked the moment to start belaboring the point about the ink blot test. I had a sneaking suspicion he had an ulterior motive. He often starts conversations with provocative statements where you suspect he is pulling some kind of power but you can’t really tell. He does it constantly and he is an ex-professor and highly intelligent and he lives in a beautiful home and he actually does have power. But I told him I wasn’t talking about the ink blot test. He started pressing me and I just threw up my hands and told him politely I was tired and sleepy and he misunderstood me. I looked at my sister and she understood I was joking but my step-dad wouldn’t drop the conversation and I go
t really, really pissed. To get him to leave me alone I told him I understood his point and leave me alone. I sat there getting more and more angry and tried to politely end the conversation. And he finally stopped and I was put in the position of feeling I had done something wrong. But I hadn’t and he gave me a ride home which was a little tense and awkward. I hate to say it but I was thinking to myself that people can be such idiots. I’ve known him for 30 years and he’s not an idiot but he just picked the wrong time."

176190741,"I listed all the people contacting me for mental health issues on another thread. I basically have a diary of 8 people calling me all the time. I think to myself that I was so much worse before and I got little if any support until it hit crisis and I was in hospital for a few weeks. It just confuses me that so many people are finally supporting me now, but it kinda feels like ‘the horse has bolted…and come back on its own’"
176190742,Hey _AT_MENTION_. Glad to hear from you. I still believe my life is in danger. It is so tough.

176190745,I sometimes feel like stopping meds because I hope I’ll feel this good off meds.
174391251,"Sorry you are having trouble. It may be the wrong med for you, or your difficulty thinking may just be a side effect of schizophrenia itself. In that case, there are a few things you can do, like exercise and sticking to a healthy diet. Both of those are helpful for the cognitive difficulties of schizophrenia. I’ve heard routines help, too, but I am bad with those. So there are some things you can do to help yourself if it is the disorder itself. Good luck."
176190746,"I can press my palms to the floor with my legs straight, go figure"
174391253,Schizophrenia has made me more quiet and less humorous and spontaneous. Might be the meds but yeah I feel it changed me. If it didn’t then it must be me maturing or adapting after my divorce. I feel it’s the schizophrenia though.
174391254,_AT_MENTION_ …I agree the meds are toxic but its a lot better than having sz full blown
176190747,"Insomnia is the biggest predictor of psychosis for me, and it takes a lot to help it. Can you call your doctor? The last time I was starting to destabilize, I had to take 10mg of haldol, 1mg of ativan, a benadryl, and a melatonin gummy before I could sleep (my doctor okayed it). Hopefully your doctor can figure out a way to get you to sleep."

I’ve noticed, if I’m upset about having sz I am significantly more incapacitated at good communication to get what I want out of a dialogue. When I am content with everything around me though, or rather with myself and where or what I am. I am usually more able to get a dialogue to go more in my favour."

Conclusion Our results show an activation of brain areas associated with working memory, including the parahippocampal gyrus, supplementary motor area, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posteriorcerebellum, rolandic operculum and insula.

An increased BOLD activity in the hyperthyroid state, as compared with the euthyroid state, can be seen while performing the 2-back task in the the right supplementary motor area, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left rolandic operculum, as well as the 1-back and the 2-back task in the right parahippocampal gyrus. All stated areas are associated with memory processes. Our data shows that short-term experimentally induced hyperthyroidism leads to an improvement in accuracy of working-memory tasks. In psychological assessment, the alerting effect in the Attention Network Task (ANT) and four out of five parameters of the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) showed an increase from euthyroid to hyperthyroid state.

So “blockbuster” like Prozac, no. On the other hand there’s still treatment resistant depression and something that really works there might be a blockbuster. I suspect that we’re also heading more towards personalized medicine, so you might have something that only a small portion of the market might take, even if everyone in that market has a particular disease. So you might have people who would stick with it for a long time, because it worked, but also you wouldn’t have as many customers."

I used to be one of those people, and trust me, posts like yours didn’t do me any favors. I’m really not trying to be an âsshole, but meds are the only thing that keep most of us sane, period.

Right now it’s up and at age 58, believe me, I understand your fears. My dad had two heart attacks when he was just a little older than I am now. That’s very sobering but it’s also good motivation for me to try harder to lose weight. I just lost 10 lbs. which is encouraging. If you just do one simple thing like quitting sugar or drastically cutting back on it, that would really make a difference. If you cut out fast food and junk food that would really jumpstart your weight loss. (and save you money. Fast food restaurants don’t even pretend that they’re fast or cheap anymore.) And as a last resort, I read articles that say you can be overweight and healthy. So if you can absolutely, not lose weight, you can still eat a little healthy and do other things to improve your health and lower your chances

All the schools around here are expensive small city universitys. Like university of Bridgeport, university of new haven, and university of Fairfield. Are the 3 schools id consider around here. But I dont wanna go to school. Im gonna have to meet girls some other way I guess. Ive always been better at self-taught than school anyways. And _USER_ID_ for a degree ever.

174391287,"Schizophreniform is a temporary diagnosis, not a permanent one. It simply is schizophrenia or schizoaffective, but it’s the interim diagnosis (Schizophrenia requires 6 months of symptoms to diagnose). So if symptoms pass with medication or without, the diagnosis goes away. You’re not schizophreniform long term. After 6 months of schizophrenia symptoms, schizophrenia is the official diagnosis. Bipolar, on the other hand, the psychotic features only occur during mood episodes. Schizoaffective you have schizophrenia symptoms without mood symptoms."

176190868,I seriously can’t tell if you need help. And I feel garbage-like casting you aside. I keep coming back because a protection for my mind is to be the best I can with what I have; like most people. But did I cause trespasses in a previous life my man?

When im on meds, or more specificly when i was on normal doses, i think i was fully without positive symptoms for long periods. I have other issues that im most definitely am never free of. Issues with self worth, trust, etc. I only trust my son. I feel that is more an attachment and trauma thing than psychosis though."

I even heard from some people they trip on aps… For me, nothing like this… I also am tired to be the slave of my pain since 25 years, i never had a life, but this is another story… I have paranoia too though and the aps never fixed this… Is it possible to trop on an ap also?

176190893,On what meds are you on?
176190894,"Yeah, getting your teeth fixed should be your main priority. Do you have a therapist, psychiatrist, case worker etc. who can maybe help you with this? They know a lot of resources and may be able to hook you up with a cheap dentist if the clinic doesn’t work out. Maybe they could find a dentist who accepts hardship cases and does dental work really cheap and allows you to make small payments each month to pay them off. But your teeth aren’t going to get better without treatment and if not taken care of right away they will get progressively worse and harder to fix."

174391302,We all know the label of schizophrenia is a bad one. So if you could rename it what would you call it? I would want something to focus on my very real challenges with visual/spatial tasks and communication. These are the biggest challenges I face along with hearing people call me names whenever I go out in public–especially for unknown reasons-grocery stores. And I am unable to tell if they really are calling me names or I am hallucinating it based on learned abuse. Anyway not to get off topic. What is a better name? I might just call it a communication disorder --thought blocking and all that…

176190900,I have lots of worst days but I’ll mention just two. When my grandpa died. I was 11. I loved him so much. When I lost my baby. She was anencephalic. She had no skull or brain. All of it and all of people’s reactions were just horrible. I’ve had horrid things done to me but this was worse.
174391304,"Sometimes, when unmedicated they even tell me to kill someone or myself. I even tried both more than once. That’s why I will never stop meds again. I am now stable on 4mg Risperdal. Risperdal is strong for positive symptoms but not as strong as Clozapine. Its equal to Zyprexa but with less weight gain. Luckily I didn’t need Clozapine as drs prescribe it to treatment-resistant patients."

176190903,"I hear a bunch of different voices, but always the same ones. I’ve learned a lot through group therapy, one of those things being that each voice has a purpose and represents certain aspects of my being. One of them, for an example, is a older priest named Aamund who talks about God either loving or wanting to punish me. I’ve learnt he represents the unaccepting christian society I grew up in, and how I never felt welcome there. Another one keeps telling me to off myself when I’m stressed or depressed, and I’ve learned he does that because there’s some situations in my life I subconsiously want out of, and death would be the quickest way to obtain that."
176190904,I have been on a year long struggle to find a decent therapist for Starlet. Everyone seems to expect a kid’s problems to be like “I don’t fit in at school” or “friendships are hard” and he needs someone who understands complex trauma.

The ginkgo stopped working for me like most supplements do, but the lion’s mane I am still experimenting with since I ran out. Webmd says ginkgo is likely effective for schizophrenic symptoms. But, like with any supplement or drug, use caution."

176190907,"That’s awful about your parents, _NAME_. They had no right to treat you the way they did. It’s despicable, it really is, and it most certainly wasn’t your fault. It doesn’t say anything about your worth though. The only person who determines how much you’re worth is you. That’s not to say that you should never care what anyone else thinks of you, because like it or not, you do and you should. It’s just that you don’t have to care what everyone thinks of you. There are people in your life whose opinions just don’t matter, and that’s okay. And with all of that said, you still have to play with the hand you’re dealt, even if it’s sh it. Because this isn’t about me or anyone else; it’s about you. Do what you can to make your own life better, easier; do what you can to make it yours. And it doesn’t always have to be about going out. Do you have Netflix? Hulu? Amazon Prime? Listen to some music (I highly recommend Green Day, _NAME_, and Cage the Elephant, to start), play som

176190959,"This morning in bed I heard my husband open the bathroom tap. Then I heard my alarm go off (it’s the sound of birds and wind in trees). But I already had switched off alarm earlier. But I clearly heard it again. Checked phone - nothing. Then when tap turned off the sounds stopped. Is it a hallucination? It’s not first time it happened to me. In Dec when I had my breakdown I heard TV mumbling in bedroom fan. And sometimes when I hear a siren or phone ringing or a doorbell etc, and when it stops, I still periodically continue hearing it. Is this a hallucination too?"

I feel mentally calmer but I have cognitive deficits and I sleep a ton more now and do little if anything. I haven’t seen an improvement in the amount of stuff I do or get done but I don’t know. I think I’m in the recovery phase. If I could make a few hundred bucks a month perpetually, I’ll be good but I’ll probably lose my disability. I think I could theoretically work in the next 1-2 years doing basic work or retail (I hate retail) but I don’t know. I have a lot of psychological and physical damage (brain). I even feel over medicated some times now that I reduced the drinks. My thinking isn’t just there. I think I’ll have to go through the DOR (meant for disabled folks that cannot get fired easily) and do that. Honestly, I cannot code and don’t know how to code or do advanced math anymore. Stuff like calculus wh
ich in the grand scheme of things isn’t advanced at all! It’s basic but it does pay the bills in terms of tutoring and looking smart. Coding is more lucrative."

176190981,"Off topic, but one of my past life hallucinations was I was either _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ from the Matrix. I can’t be both. We had a battle. As you know _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ can have false projections or “clones” where there are multiple copies of them battling it out lol. It felt real but could have been fake or just plain insanity, but I have had _PERSON_ dreams and re-occuring themes in my life. That I was the real _PERSON_ from Norse Mythology. But then I believe in _PERSON_ too, so there’s that. I’ve hallucinated a lot in my past lives. Not anymore. I guess ‘things’ can drive me insane. I rather just be cool and recover though. No point in figuring it all out and going nuts again."

176190991,Sometimes I take a nap with my son. It definitely helps with my mental health.

It’s 10:40 here now and I’m not really sleepy but I’m going to force myself. Sleep definitely is a big part of me making progress. I HAVE to sleep well every night because it’s important that I’m healthy for myself and for my son.

Then of course I re-looked into HAARP and the video I watched made me fall deeper into a state of distrust, then I looked into 5G and it’s supposed side effects. Then of course I mentally tied in current events and had alot of mental wires crossed. This led me to driving into work early in the pouring rain listening to The Weeknd - Starboy album which is my most vivid tie to when I used to be actively psychotic and remembered how I thought I was getting secret messages in music and in numbers. Before I got in the car I took an extra dose of invega because I felt my rationale go down a windy road.

Why wouldn’t she want his perspective??

Just curious when others felt some sort of relief. Can you elaborate your experience from the beginning when you got your shot? A lil before and after. Experience and time frame of how it helped your symptoms?

176191019,"I don’t think that would be weird, especially if notes help you remember and keep you focused on what you need to tell your pdoc so they can better help you. During my appointments, the pdoc just asks my symptoms and how I’m feeling on meds."

176191021,"I’m not a big fan of CBT, this sounds more interesting. You have to challenge your brain. “Narrowly defined, CR is a set of cognitive drills or compensatory interventions designed to enhance cognitive functioning. However, from the vantage point of the rehabilitation field, CR engages the participant in a learning activity to enhance the neurocognitive skills relevant to overall recovery goals.[4] CR programs vary in the extent to which they reflect these narrow or broader perspectives, and there is ongoing research to identify the active ingredients that result in a positive response to treatment. Data suggests that when cognitive remediation is provided to people with schizophrenia, it is most effective when given in the broader context of psychosocial rehabilitation.[2][3] Recent attention has turned to incorporating motivational enhancements into the treatment of cognitive dysfunction for psychological disorders.[4]” Cognitive remediation therapy - Wikipedia"

So far I have had 2 lessons with a pretty good teacher that I found on Craigslist. I can’t believe the things I’m able to do with this instrument after 2 lessons. Here’s to hoping it works out.

CBD oil products do not contain this cannabinoid and do not have psychoactive properties. Products high in CBD have actually been found to potentially reduce symptoms of psychosis. That being said, CBD oil does have the potential to interact with antipsychotic medications. It has been found to reduce the clearance of some antipsychotic medications from the body. Before using CBD oil with antipsychotics, you should discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.” it looks like it can interact with them in two ways: when it contains THC which is hallucinogenic it slows your metabolism (sedates) thus making AP’s stay in your system longer CBD that has no THC its essentially a good sedater then that being said it seems it may throw off your current med balance so its important to talk to your doctor and select an appropriate dose and treat it like you wo

I feel good today more than an hour after and I still feel good. 0 signs of mania or psychosis just good well being. So it’s definitely starting to work.

174391353,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Suicide attempts in people with schizophrenia before and after participating in an intensive case managed community program: A 20-year follow-up. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Psychiatry research , Jul 2019 10 Lack of treatment compliance in patients with schizophrenia is a risk factor that leads to illness-relapse, hospitalization and potentially strengthens suicidal behavior. The purpose of this investigation was to assess treatment adherence, reasons for treatment discharge, suicidal behaviour and impact of route of antipsychotics administration in a group of patients with schizophrenia treated in a comprehensive, community-based, intensive case managed program for people with severe mental illness. And to compare it to previous standard treatment received in mental health units (MHU). An observational, longitudinal, mirror-image study of patients with severe schizophrenia (N?=?344) was carried out: ten years of follow-up (Program) and ten years retrospective (MHU). Reasons for 
treatment discharge, suicide attempts and antipsychotic (AP) medication were recorded. Treatment adherence during the Program was higher than in MHU (abandonment of treatment: 12.2% vs. 84.3% of patients). Forty patients died during follow-up, five of them due to suicide. Suicidal attempts significantly decreased during Program treatment compared to the standard one (7.6% vs. 38.9% of patients). Long-acting injectable (LAI) AP medication was significantly related to this outcome. A combination of intensive case-managed and LAIAP treatment helped to improve compliance and to reduce suicidal behavior compared to standard treatment in patients with severe schizophrenia."

This worked extremely well until I tried to double major in philosophy and economics and then philosophy and math. This put a number of ‘black marks’ on my transcripts, put me into a deep depression, and sent my career into the dark ages. I really do not know what to do for my career. I grew up in a suburban neighbourhood with a middle-class lifestyle. Therefore, I don’t know if I would be able to handle being on disability. I also have a great investment idea, but no money to invest. Really, the only option is to go for my philosophy M.A. and then hopefully Ph.D. But I’m just too depressed about my situation to even think about it… Anyone here have any insights or ideas or even relate to my problems?"

When things meant to make you fall, it’s meant to let you learn something out of it not to destory you (analogy of a baby who learns to walk will never be beaten to the point of sitting on the ground crying forever and be in agony). At some point in life, many whom suffers schizophrenia or a certain mental health condition for a long period of time will tend to forget quite a number of things which we used to do or once be (which might helps your condition, so it’s a vicious cycle if you have forgotten alot of things) when we were rather normal when we were younger. Friends have a lot of different levels and depths,

At this point I don’t really know if I am delusional and imagining it or if my feelings of being threatened are real and if they are, I don’t know how they’re doing it. I can’t describe it. I don’t know if the sh*t they put out is magic or getting into my head or some kind of mental health trick that can’t be explained or some new way of bugging someone that they invented.

When I went into psychosis in 2016, the first voices I heard were that of my children that are no longer with me. After awhile I started watching people and patterns to develop a way of communicating without talking. This eventually changed into being able to read minds. I started hearing not just human minds but that of trees, rocks, planets, solar systems, quantum particles, animals, sea creatures, aliens (from our planet and elsewhere), dragons (they come from earth), I’ve also contacted long deceased people while reading their books. Some of these conversations have been very interesting. My voices aren’t negative, unless I contact someone who doesn’t like me. (ex-husband) I don’t contact him. I don’t base my daily actions on what I hear, that can be dangerous. I like to listen for a laugh or guidance in understanding myself. My favorit
e voice is my dragon, Moonshine. I was able to see him in person once. He teaches me about balance and working with all life around me."

I feel so much better on a low sodium diet which I track using an app every day. I do a lot more yoga and walking now because I don’t get fatigued as easily from having high BP.

My main question of the post was what if even though I’m psychotic this will still happen. Also what if I just think I’m psychotic but actually am not.

176191338,"When you work for a living, if you want to advance to a better role in a company, you generally have to fight for it. Where there’s a winner there’s also going to be a loser or many losers depending on what went down. One shouldn’t do anything unethical to get the spot, but there’s nothing wrong with being aggressive in terms of making it known that you want that position and why you believe you’re the right choice, especially based on excellent past performance. There are people at my workplace who are upset with me for being offered a work-from-home position (starting Sept 3). The reason I got it was because I outperformed them, plain and simple. That’s what happens when one person works hard and others mess around on their phones half the time and then gripe because something wasn’t handed to them. EARN IT, folks."

176191351,"Catheters are always fun, I wish I discovered them in my twenties just for something to do. NOT. So today at the hospital was lovely, I got to spend three hours with a sexy nurse—peeing through a footlong plastic tube she stuck up my d*ck into a bucket naked from the waist down while she watched from two feet away. And THAT was the fun part. Lets just say there was more tubes, spreading legs, containers, lots of discussing bodily functions. The problem started because I drank a ton of liquid a day for a very long time and it affected my bladder so I was at Stanford hospital. It’s actually extremely serious but not life threatening. It’s not the best dinner conversation but I had to talk to the nurse and a urologist about it. The ludicrous part is that they had a computer with just YouTube playing and the nurse asked what my favorite music is so I listened to _PERSON_ for two and half hours straight! Day Tripper my ass."
176191352,"I’m not doing well today. I woke up feeling okay, but now I’m having one of those “I just want to off myself” kind of moods. I’m not going to do it, don’t need a hospital or crisis line. There’s not much they could do for me, anyway. I mean, ????, I’m already on two ADs and a mood stabilizer, besides my two APs. I just have to ride this out, hating my life."

176191354,"As I said, she suggested me to put me on nortriptyline. I am actually on it and I have very bad side effects but she doesn’t want me to stop it. She wants me to be on this medication for a long time.

176191359,"Before judging people might want to consider reading the lives of the saints, including those who chose to live “filthy” existences. Were the desert saints, for instance, delused? Was St _NAME_ deluded? What about Buddha, or the counteless yogis roaming the streets of India? The humblest utterance ever delivered by a saint came from a sufi mystic, _PERSON_, who confidently claimed “I am God”."
176191360,I need to look into changing meds carefully _AT_MENTION_ . I’m going to bring up Latuda and other meds. But she is very reluctant for me to change meds. Last time I switched meds I ended up in the psych ward for 5 weeks. But I need to do something. I think that the risperidone increase is making me feel worse.

I appreciate all the feedback. Everyone is right, this is something you should decide for yourself, ultimately."
176191361,I used to weigh 170 lbs but since I started Latuda I am just under 230 but I am 6’1” and a guy and 50. I don’t feel overweight but I have a belly. I don’t diet or watch what I eat and I am not getting any bigger so I don’t mind. Latuda helps me.
176191362,Yes you need to have a mental health condition
176191363,"Yeah, I get them. They are pretty rare though. The best thing to do is find a supportive person and hang out with them until it ends. That’s what I do anyway. Usually passes within an hour of starting. I feel like if they happen rarely, you don’t really need to change anything. Just put up with them when they do happen. If you’re getting them more than once a week though, then I guess you should tell your doctor and maybe change something."
176191364,It can take time to come to terms with the fact that your mind has basically been playing tricks on you. And that meds have fixed it.
176191365,"OMG, I had a nightmare where I dreamt we all stood close together without face masks and laughed, spraying saliva droplets. It was terrible! The worst nightmare I’ve had in a long time!"

174391433,"Anyone ever heard of this or have this delusion? Scientists talk about it but say it’s not possible yet. I often take the schizophrenic perspective and say it’s already happening and that I can remember because of quantum mechanics. It’s still a guessing and figuring out game because I don’t know what they did or why or how, but it put me in a causal loop in the year 2011 according to my delusion. I keep experiencing consciousness transfer back in time. I call it my time loop. The universe resets. I often invoke string theory and say the universe bounces back but that’s some minority point of view and I have no science or math background. Thank You!"
176191372,I never take the path of least reistance eithr in real life or on a computer but to avoid a ‘cracked out’ feeling there must be a balance its working out i suppose.
176191373,Good to know. My doctor suggested I take it to improve my sleep… ? Anyway I never bought it
176191374,"Vistaril (hydroxyzine) is an antihistamine used for hives, itching, etc. Because it causes mild sedation, it’s also used as an anxiety med or even as a sleep aid."
176191375,I also thought about suicide to give my parents insurance money but I think the insurance will refuse because suicide is not accidental death.
176191376,"I had a strong delusion that I was getting coded messages (like between good friends) from the T.V. during my first psychotic break. I was so sure that they were finally breaking down the barrier between the screen and me. If you’re still delusional I know this may be hard to understand…but that really was a delusion. That sensation is what makes it so. I’ve gone a long way without having another delusion this end of the year but, it can still happen, and just because I know now doesn’t mean I’ll ignore the notion in the moment. There’s some strange quality to those moments that just allow you to think so much is happening out off of so little. Just try to grasp reality inbetween those moments and rationalize yourself into a confident zone so you aren’t afraid of conspiracies or things that could make you feel fear for no real reason."
174391428,"Compared to now, life before schizophrenia was easy. I kind of regret going to school and smoking pot, but I feel ‘divine intervention’ or some crap. Like it happened in 1 day and then that’s that. The drugs, stress of school and stuff must have unleashed toxins and neurotransmitters in my brain and stuff in a perfect storm of things. I strongly believe pot and drugs make me schizophrenic in every life in the universe. Must be some anomaly, soul consciousness reincarnation crap. I don’t know if it was mk ultra monarch or what. Other stuff too from other lives or timelines and then the psychic realm giving me information. I go crazy. I originally had schizophrenia in high school but the aliens changed it to college. I feel worse, but maybe it’s a blessing in disguise… I think it’s a generational thing where my family and relativies were targeted through the generation. Maybe I have witches or warlocks or just Christian folk. I had a step-grandfather freemason which seems to cause all m
y issues even though he was a good man apparently and Christian and upstanding citizen… My dad was abusive and had anger issues growing up and I get this ‘spyishness’ or paranoia about my stepfather who is smart and a genius. It never goes away. He’s also very arrogant and suffers from short man syndrome and lies, is or was a narcissist in some ways and thinks he’s the smartest man in the room as well as the most moral Christian person in the world sometimes…he comes off as a fake and a ???????. My mom is in some ways more disabled than me but is a good person. Sort of ‘cultish’ when it comes to Christianity. My views are I was targeted because of mk-ultra, monarch, bitcoin, _NAME_ titor, and generational and past life incarnations by the government and illuminati and even grey aliens and demons. The illuminati could be the most rich and powerful people and families in the world, I guess. I don’t know. Banks and crap… I had alien intervention my entire childhood where they were watching me 
and communicating with me and getting inside my head. A ???????? christian would say they’re demons or I’m demon possessed. I don’t know."

176191381,"I can’t cry really. It took years for me to cry over my mother’s death. I feel things I just can’t cry. I used to cry at the littlest things. I was a crier for sure, very emotional. Maybe I got it all out of my system already lol."
176191382,Yes. Do you have voices despite the meds?
176191383,Chewy you are famous in my eyes!
176191384,I don’t think we’re that difficult to spot as mentally ill. It’s why a lot of us don’t like to leave our house.
176191385,I think requesting the case notes might be a good place to start. And since you were in that bad a place mentally it would make sense that your brain might try to block it out. Cause that’s kinda why dissociation happens. When your overwhelmed sometimes it’s better to shut off.
176191386,I share some of your side effects but the heart issues you’re experiencing would really concern me. Can you switch APs?
176191387,Not so standard now.

176191390,One day I wrote my story of my life from 17-26 when I was still 26 years old. The longest piece of writing I’ve ever done. 44k words but I don’t know if I wanna keep it even though I got it professionally edited. 18-22 years old was particularly eventful I thought. Unfortunately it wasn’t good stuff but it told a story. Yeah you’re right. I got my story from 18-22 particularly I could write a million different ways. I don’t need more crazy ???? honestly. Would you ever write your memoir?
176191391,You did well today You can handle it The voices don’t define you
176191392,"I do like what you say but I thought you completely ignored the insanity defense. I know that some ppl fake their mental illness like drug dealers or mafia members, they take advantage of the insanity defense and its sad."
176191393,I play enough cricket in the bottom grade to just like playing the game. We often play teams that are way better than my team and we regularly get pummeled. It’s not much fun getting beaten all the time but when you love the game!

176191398,"_AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ , do you mind me asking how old you are?"
176191399,Yes No Sort of 0 voters Was going inpatient useful?
176191400,"It is good news hearing you say this! There is good news, it must be a common symptom because I have it too. My story goes I was one with God as a child, I was becoming a saint, but failed when I gave up on life at age fourteen. My Christ self went bad when I got sz and fell to earth and is now Satan. And I gave in to all the devil stuff so I’m responsible. I was God’s representative on earth and I went bad. I was an incarnation of the ultimate deity, and now I’m as low as an insect. I hope this post is approved, even though it’s about religion, because it really is tormenting and destructive to self and others to think you’re bad."
176191401,My cousin had _PERSON_ too. He’s dead now. No other mental illness in my family except for depression.
176191402,"It helps a lot with the depression. But the sexual side effects suck. Should I ask the doctor to lower it to 60 mg or something or maybe 90 mg? I mean it works but I’m just not so sure it’s worth it. I gotta pick what’s more important: not being depressed or what… No other antidepressants work. I probably wouldn’t even need an AP if it weren’t for my energy drink addiction. I have no motivation anyways even on meds and now I refuse to get ECT. I don’t need it. The doctor is just pushing it sometimes. Maybe he has good intentions. My memory already sucks. I just suffer a lot from depression mainly and being under-stimulated a ton. I think if most people drank 6 monsters a day they would either die from a heart attack or stroke. I guess I’m lucky. Been doing it for years. I need to stop. The vraylar does help a lot. Makes me think I might just have psychotic depression or something. I did score a lot higher for psychotic depression than schizo-affective disorder but the intern psychol
ogist decided to put schizo-affective disorder instead. I guess I was super depressed, ashamed, embarrassed, sad, and felt inferior for getting Cs in my math classes, ruining graduate school, and getting Ds and Fs on my math test sometimes. That and dropping out of a prestigious college with 5 classes left to graduate. I’m pretty much over it and have moved on so not sure why I still would have psychotic depression… I do feel sad that I am obese. I used to take pride in my appearance. Thank You."
176191403,Untrue. I am a professional. I have eight years of experience in direct behavioral therapy and another five years of experience working on the administrative side.
176191404,"You know how these things work, one man’s delusion is another man’s unusual belief. I’m intrigued though about what you understand as “value” of a delusion."
176191405,Hey I’m wondering if anybody else has had bizarre delusions before one time I thought bugs were eating my brain that was a long time ago but I’m just wondering if anybody else gets issues like that I wonder if I’m the only one ?
176191406,"Oh I didn?t know that, sorry. I am sza depressive type so I don?t deal with mania. Maybe the Depakote suggestion is better. I hope you?re able to get it sorted out so you feel better!"
176191407,"ok so college is kind of like A and AS levels in the UK, perhaps, as that is what we do just before entering university, typically, and is also 2 years. I meant treasure it mentally. and perhaps save the certificates can I ask which one?"
176191408,"_AT_MENTION_ Presumably I was schizotypal for decades until I got upgraded to full blown SZ -always according to the doctors. During your existential musings, did you also redefine your place in the universe and establish a special relationship with god and mankind’s fate?"
176191409,I was in the throws of psychosis and paranoia but still working and hadn’t figured out I was sick yet. Bought a house in Texas that year. Renting it out now.
176191411,I have an urge to do that though
174391435,That’s odd that it increases dopamine. L-theanine always calmed my positive symptoms down.
176191412,I feel you man! _AT_MENTION_
176191413,It’s the annual inspection. It just so happens that I just moved in. I have boxes of unbuilt furniture piled up. I have stuff I need to take to the dumpster like broken down boxes and other packing material. I have half unpacked boxes lying around. I need to finish more furniture so I can put some stuff away. It’s kinda a mess. I hope I have enough time and energy to get it to where I can pass inspection.

176191417,"Thanks, I will talk about it to my mother when she comes from work. We usually go all the family together one apt, its better than going many times. Also I am not patient so at least I will have my mother to pass time in the blood test waiting room."
174391442,My past God delusions made me an atheist. Religion is bad for my positive symptoms. During psychosis I thought I was God and tried to kill myself twice to prove it. I stay away from religion.
176191418,This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
176191419,"_PERSON_…i hate when that happens. Are his reflexes normal? There’s also a thing called functional neurological disorder and it can cause paralysis because the brain doesn’t send signals well. It’s a real condition and my friend is suffering from it herself, and she is having a lot of trouble. Despite not having dx, see if you can get him to see a PT because exercise can be helpful. Also I’m not a doctor but I just wanted to help!"
174391441,"I still don’t know for certain, but I began to suspect schizophrenia when I started hearing voices regularly and then those voices evolved to having a telepathic connection to them. I researched schizophrenia and realized that I have most of the symptoms. A doctor has yet to give me a formal diagnosis but I fear it’s only a matter of time. Or, maybe I have bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or something on the schizophrenia spectrum. Whatever it is, I wish I could get a clear diagnosis and that way I’d have a better understand of what’s wrong with me. It’s really isolating."

176191423,"I also had several diagnoses - bipolar, sza, undifferentiated sz, paranoid sz and borderline personality. But my latest two pdoc’s agree with me that I have sza bipolar type and it fits the best."
174391446,"None of my family had schizophrenia too, but i was diagnosed as one, many argued that it’s generic. At some point yes, but mostly are because of the environment that we are in, twisted, illogical and contradicting reasonings that caused our manifestations of their crap load. We have become haywired, that is true, but by facts and truth is also that, the environment around us are just bad. _NAME_ a.k.a lordarous"
174391438,"I’ve worked pretty steadily since about 1983 when I was 22. I have had mostly unskilled, entry level, labor jobs. I did very good at some of them but if I had never become schizophrenic at age 19 I would think that I would have had skilled, higher paying jobs. Funny enough, I got my first job at age 17 and after three months I quit and then I had a string of about 15 different jobs and never lasted more than three months at any of them until I got diagnosed at age 19. I also just barely graduated high school and my senior year I flunked almost all my classes and got kicked out of school. I got my diploma but just barely. In 1983 after three years of being unemployed I got a job and stayed four years. Then in 1984 I also enrolled myself in community college. What’s funny is that I’ve lasted longer at jobs after being diagnosed. I’ve had a few jobs where I’ve lasted more than three years. And I flunked a lot of classes in high school but in college I’ve gotten more than a few A’s in cla
sses and many B’s and C’s."

176191425,well yeah i get that
176191426,"Yeah I have trouble thinking due to just crazy or bad thoughts or voices. I’m not really sure who I am as I sit here now, but I’m thinking a bit more clearly today. It’s hard for me to set aside all the strange thoughts I’ve had."
176191427,my doctor office called me.
176191428,"_AT_MENTION_ I sometimes wonder, if I’d behaved better in high school if I would be better now. Though, it was a very terrible stressful year that actually pushed me over the edge.

176191433,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ I’m hoping this med change will help
176191434,"I tell you, my brother the other day just brushed me off he said something along the lines of “well I worked today” and I cursed up a storm when he left the room, and then told my mom “you know I wish I could work, when I could work I did, and I still got ???? for not working full time.” I just wish that people would keep in mind, that me not working isn’t a choice. When I’m stuck in bed till 2-3pm its not because I wanted to. Its just my brain not being right. I can’t help it. I swear its eye opening to just see how oblivious people are, and then they expect you to give them respect back, like they haven’t glibbly pooped on you blithely through the work week. An hour later I’d calmed down, and just moved past it. I don’t keep the anger in. I just let it out when it happens and then I’m done. I just don’t have the option to keep negative. There’s no way forward otherwise."

176191442,"Today, and earlier this week, I went out for a run/jog/walk/shuffle/…by feel, my feet are still in recovery after all these months. I and recklessness had previously had me getting injured a lot, especially on the left side of my body where my knee foot and shoulder joint had been out of business. Now I’m strengthening those things, and I’m learning new stretches. My shoulder is better after years, I stare at my phone in my left hand and have bad posture. I got over a flare up of plantar fasciitis, and I’m starting to work through the other issue with my foot; sesamoiditis, inflammation where my big toe joint meets the long bones of my foot. My knee was asleep, many components were asleep. Anyhow, I walk briskly, then I walk slowly, then I build up again to a moderate pace, and I go by feel, to allow my left side to start engaging without feeling too bad. I jog and I run. It may be premature, but I did it today. I ran faster than I might have liked, but I achieved my goal, as I push past a 
street, or a mail box for example, then stop, or slow down the pace, my will strengthens. I picked up the pace toward the end because I saw a guy out there really moving smoothly. I tried to imitate him for a block, staring at my shadow on the pavement. He took steps which were short and quick, not strides, not a shuffle…he ran “deliberately”. Moderate cardio…I think…improves thinking…if not permanently…at least transiently. And concerning ”as to why?” :here are non-scientific guesses: -It pumps blood to the brain -Climbing a hill takes “will” -Jargon: Breathing, Chemicals, Biology, Executive, Spatial, Processing, Working…”Visuospatial sketchpad“ I left my gloves sitting in the rain and had to pick them up so I was going somewhere anyway.

176191484,"That’s where I want to live. Seems pretty conservative and nice, but I cannot live alone. I don’t know why we stay in California. It’s overpopulated, smoggy, crime ridden, and expensive. It’s nice if you have too much money and live in a beautiful area like the beaches or mountains, but most people like us are poor and live places where the roads are full of holes, it’s turning ghetto, people cannot drive, and more. Taxes are extreme and the only thing I look forward to doing is going to university because they are actually ranked pretty good even the local ones. Much better than most states and they are really affordable. I heard _NAME_, Texas is good and anywhere in Florida pretty much. I cannot live or survive on my own and I get too lonely. I would have to live with my mom and brother or something. My dad is moving to _NAME_ and I cannot go with him because we fight. It’s also kinda of in the boons and small and nothing to do. If I had money, I would own a ranch in Northern _NAME_ o
r Wyoming. Like Lake Tahoe or somewhere by _NAME_, Wyoming. _NAME_ seems tech-y and more conservative than California, I guess. It’s civilized, I guess. If I recovered, I would go to UNLV, Texas-_NAME_, Rice University, or some UF in Florida. Pretty nice places all ranked and prestigious, especially Rice and Texas-_NAME_. The UCs are great and sort of better like UCLA but then I get my fear ramped up and PTSD stuff from whatever happened to me in college like alien abduction or bad drug trip (2011) from pot or something I smoked like that. _USER_ID_ or some messed up stuff I bought online that gave me a bad trip. I think it was legal in the US but I’m not sure about California at the time back in 2011; I don’t even remember what it was or the name or if it was just a bad batch. Similar to the _USER_ID_ laws. Then I also wouldn’t be surprised (or imagining) that I tried synthetic pot (or was that in a parallel universe?). One therapist said I had brain damage from synthetic pot even though I had no mem
ory. For some reason, I was targeted by grey aliens and I thought there were humans involved…but it’s all so not there anymore and I’m grasping for straws all the time trying to figure and remember things out. I think monster drinks ramp up my OCD personality and make me think back a lot to those days and not recover. Like I’m constantly searching for answers and clues about what happened to me. I’ve been to other parallel universes in my past lives so it all is non-linear and apparently (true, I guess) God or the higher Being does not want me to remember or figure it out for some odd, unapparent reason(s). I remember seeing a spacecraft above my house in 2016 (several) and other things too and it makes me think I went to Mars and maybe saw a similar craft at _PERSON_ back in 2011, but I don’t know if that was a different planet Earth lol… I hope I can go back to school without being harassed or my reputation being ruined, I guess and hope… Obviously a different school altogether.

176191485,"Why does it make you feel bad to be on welfare? Welfare is a good thing. It keeps society from collapsing. The people in power didn’t start welfare programs because they were feeling generous. They did it because the lower class was gearing up to revolt and overthrow the ruling class. They then started a narrative of people on welfare being evil lazy leeches so the middle class would start blaming the lower class for their problems instead of uniting with them against the people in charge. The fact that you’re vilifying another section of people receiving the same benefits as you is proof that their rhetoric is working. People who get SNAP, TANF, and so on are not evil, they’re not leeches, and they’re not stealing from hard working people. They’re just trying to get by. Same as you. Again, if you want to talk about lazy, entitled leeches, look at the people who set minimum wage so low that people working full time jobs still can’t afford to live without assistance."

Voice is telling me hes god and of course when he told that one girl I never met said to me did you know god is bad.

176191549,"The harsh truth is that there is no quick fix. Diet pills are dangerous on the whole, especially if you get them on the web. There is a risk of dying from them! Become serious about a diet. Count calories and exercise. This will take a few months! Not weeks or days. If you put in the effort you will see the gains. There is no other healthy way! It is possible in that I lost 10kgs in 4 months. Without meds, I’m sure I could have lost it a lot quicker, but those are the breaks. Forget weight loss pills, they are dangerous."

176191557,Yeah doctors want to cover their butts so at times will keep people as long as possible. I remember when I did php they didn’t want to let me leave even though I felt fine when I did and I had to sign an AMA. I left and had no further issues. That sucks about your doctor going on holiday. Hope you get out soon!

176191562,It may not matter what your dx is. If your current meds help you function then your on the right track. The dx is to help the psychiatrist have a good profile of you to prescribe the right treatments.

I said we should buy frozen rolls, but she insisted on making yeast rolls day of. Now she’s saying her back hurts and she needs me to make the rolls, I knew this was going to happen! I’m not making the goddamn rolls, its too complicated and I want to enjoy Thanksgiving too."

And I can’t go to sleep until he does because I sleep on the couch usually.

176191586,"So I’m hearing an exaggerated shifting sound when I make large movements with my eyes from right to left/other way around. I think its rather neat that, a physical sensation is causing a hallucination of an auditory shifting sound. I’m glad I can pinpoint it to an associated movement because before I figured it out it was this weird sort of …wtf is that? Now I know its associated with eye movement. Either way its absolutely bizarre what these stupid malfunctioning brains can toss at us."

176191589,"Well I’ll tell you about one experience I had tidying my bed room rather than the experience I had cleaning my bathroom. I don’t know if these experiences were exactly the same, but it seemed to me that rubbish kept appearing as I tidied up. Mopping the bathroom was a more extreme experience in that I was conscious as well rather than just observing. I don’t really want to talk about it, or at least can’t put myself in that frame of mind at the moment to remember exactly how it was. There was urine all over the walls which was nothing to do with me, and I had to mop the same areas of floor several times."

I take it first thing in the morning and it gives me a lot of energy to get through the full day without napping. I like it, but it doesn’t actually make me hyper. Maybe you’re just getting used to it since you started on a higher dose. If it keeps happening, you should mention it to your pdoc and see what they say.

176191592,"I have experimented with certain drugs like MDMA, mushrooms and LSD, and can tell you that these drugs can bring on an episode, which I believe LSD and mushrooms contributed to my last episode. I have never tried cocaine, as I am aware this is one of the worst drugs for bringing about a psychosis. Even weed will increase your chances of having an episode, especially if you smoke it regularly. That being said, I have never had a problem with alcohol. Drinking in social settings, even to excess, has never been problematic for me. Just keep your drinking to every now and then, and you will be able to enjoy several drinks on occasion. Keep in mind I emphasize the every now and then."

I came close to death a couple of times when I was off medication but managed to not get harmed. It was scary how out of touch with reality I became. There are still side effects of the medication that I’m dealing with like high prolactin levels, slightly high cholesterol, sleeping too much but overall I’m doing a lot better than 2 years ago."

I like the shading, I don’t usually put any shadows in my sketches, which are usually colored fine tip pen and colored ball point pen. In the hospital I used crayon and it looked a little like paint to me. I actually like crayon a lot. When I filled out my questionnaire about my stay at the mental hospital I mentioned they need new art supplies - they would not even allow us to have regular pencils and pens!

176191612,"Well, there is essentially a plan to put me into a high quality care home in North India. We’ve always lived in South India and looked at care homes here but they are all low quality. When I became aware that I was sz, I agreed to be put into the best of the garbage during states of high psychosis. It was not a good experience(no running water, no therapy, no doc, no english speaking staff etc) and it was really hard at first…but I learned to adapt. The first time I was taken out by my family after 4 months. The second time after 2 weeks. But sometimes, as I sit here in my room at home, I even yearn for it. The gem it offers for me is an environment where I could talk with others vs the home where I can use a computer, eat good food, and browse the net…but where I only know 3 people(mom, dad, bro) and none want to talk to me. Current indications of our financial status is that a care home in North India may not be possible. But I’ve learned to integrate with my reality and dont need much to 
be happy. Prime states for me: Using graphics apps on my laptop Watching movies, reading books, listening to music Eating tasty food Intelligent conversations with others(not just habitual chatter) Volunteering If I move to a care home, its very likely I wont have access to a laptop and almost certain I wont have access to Internet. I’m also pretty certain I wont have access to something like my folk’s great cooking and I am unsure if other patients will want to have conversations with me or even how much access I will have to outside world. So my projection of a likely ‘horrible’ future currently is: just access to books and music So from time to time, I unplug from my laptop, and from internet on my smartphone(no SIM card) to try and see how I handle living without the only tools I have to distract my mind from harsh present moments. I have more than 200 books on my phone and about 300 MP3s. I am able to get by okay for about 2 days(max!) before the urge becomes too strong. But I keep trying(sometim
es multiple times a month)…because I believe I can…in fact, now that you’ve reminded me, I just realized that the ones that dont work are cold turkey unplugs…no tech whatsoever. So this time I’ll try sticking to just books and music. Got a good feeling about this. Hopefully there will be no posts from me for at least 3 days…"

176191649,"It has long been debated in transmasculine circles whether going on testosterone can make you suddenly attracted to men. It is pretty common for a trans man to only be attracted to girls, then after starting hormone replacement, they suddenly start being attracted to guys. Some say the people were always attracted to men, but didn’t realize it because they felt so uncomfortable with their bodies before. Some say the heightened testosterone makes them have higher sex drives, and then they start noticing people they were only mildly attracted to before. But the reverse doesn’t seem to be true for transfeminine people. Lowering testosterone and raising estrogen does not seem to have an effect on sexual preferences."

174391520,Some days I don’t hear nearly as much voices as I usually do. This only happens rarely. This is going on the 4th day that I’m not hearing as nearly as much voices. I don’t know why. It could be because I’m taking more abilify(9.5 mg instead of 7.5 mg). One time when I went to the beach I didn’t hear nearly as much voices for 3 or 4 days…so I don’t know if it is the medicine or it is just happening.

But when I get stressed out my functioning takes a huge nosedive. For example I can shop online for groceries. I can cook for myself (microwave meals not actual cooking). Etc. I think I present myself as higher functioning than I actually am. I can pass as a normie for short periods socially. So to answer your question I’d say lower-medium masquerading as higher-medium.

174391514,"Respect per se is not a bad thing. But in the context of this post it pretty much illustrates what is wrong with the way schizophrenics are treated by society and each other. You didn’t have to put that line in. In the bigger picture and in my own personal picture, it does me a disservice by you not only negating my struggles as a schizophrenic and what I’ve gone through with these people and lowers and dismisses their part in it. It chooses them over me. And by saying that simple line it lowers my status in an apartment building where I pay rent and makes me seem not as “good” as them and makes it seem like they deserve respect and I don’t and makes it look like I am the bad guy and that I’m wrong in fighting back against them. When we do that to each other, it makes us less than. Respect isn’t wrong per se as I said, but in this case you’re almost choosing them over me.

174391527,"I know that people with schizophrenia can have limitations in social skills, but I somehow think that my problem with conversation may not be explainable by just saying its part of schizophrenia. What I mean is that when it comes to casual conversation, I never care about what anyone has to say, and I never want to share anything about myself. So in other words, I don’t mind situations in which someone has to say something in order to “take care of business”, or if I feel like I want to hear advice from someone and I have to reveal something about myself in order to get it, but beyond that there’s something about conversation that I don’t like. The thing is, I feel like over time I’ve been conditioned to feel like something’s wrong with me for being this way. Yet, despite thinking this, I seem completely unwilling to give conversation a chance, to try putting up with small talk in order to possibly get to know someone and genuinely connect. If I’m in a situation where I have to soci
alize for a little while, I can sort of manage to do what’s expected of me, asking basic questions and sharing basic things. However, if I had to actually attempt to make a friend (yes, I have no friends), and keep in touch, and keep talking at length on numerous occasions, I wouldn’t be able to do it. I’d run out of things to say. I think I somehow never learned to make normal conversation, since back when I had friends our “conversations” were mostly just coming up with random things to joke about. I guess it worked back when I was a teenager, but now that I’m older I feel like even if I could think the same way again, it wouldn’t work for me because once you get older conversation is supposed to be different from that. At the moment, I don’t do enough on a day to day basis to have much to say about myself, and my lack of interest in people makes it hard for me to even come up with questions to ask people about themselves, so I feel stuck. Has anyone here had similar experiences? If you have

I go once a month now as maintenance"
176191778,"I saw that a few of you are doing this, so I have decided to share my story as well. Trigger warning just in case. My story starts when I was 8. I was heavily abused by teachers and students who did not like my attitude and my high grades. I was a top student in my elementary school, so students apparently hated that. They bullied me to the point that I was contemplating suicide. Added to that, my teachers were abusive. Even after graduating and moving to Canada for school, Korean students started to bully me in my new Canadian school. I struggled with my abuse for a number of years before actually talking about it. I would get horrible flashbacks of it. It was horrifying. When I was 14, I saw my first hallucination. It was a shadowy-like figure who was just wondering around. He didn’t do anything much. However, I got extremely depressed and I started self-harming. My mom and I had a huge fight because of it. That’s how my mental health started to fail. Time went by, and I went to high school. 
However, the voices became so unbearable to the point that I couldn’t handle life. I kept seeing things whom asked me to harm myself, jump out of a window, etc. I struggled with this for a while before actually seeking help. At this point, my psychosis became extreme. I was in danger to myself, and I kept hurting myself in secret. My mom went back to Korea so I didn’t mind harming myself more. My guardian, who has a daughter with anxiety, decided to send me to psychiatric ward for youth. I owe a huge thank you to her. My time there was tough. I was having a really hard time. I kept seeing shadow being pooled in the corner, and that freaked me out. However, with the help of my friends there, we developed a really strong relationship. This then became to a mother-child relationship. I was the mother, they were the children. I’ve written a lot of poetry for these “children”. When I graduated from the program, I was able to go to my guardian’s place. My mental health seemed to stabilize but I was fall
ing into psychosis again and again. My university years were horrible- I kept having voices in my head. This became so extreme that I was convinced by a vision to commit suicide. I went to the hospital but the voices didn’t stop; they had to tie me up from harming myself. After hours of struggling, I was put into a psych ward. This process repeated itself for many years forward. My friends were trying to hold me back together, but I was just…broken. About 3 years ago, I returned to Korea to recover as I became paralyzed (interesting, right?) and we struggled to find a cause to my sudden paralysis. After years of talking with doctors who don’t know anything, we concluded that it was conversion disorder. But I was adamant that it was something else, so I and my parents fought a lot. Even after I relearned how to walk, I was never able to recover my twisted joints, stiff legs, hypermobility, and loss of strength in my muscles. I worked hard in physio, but it never worked out. We were dumbfounded. We decide
d to seek a last opinion from a geneticist who knows a lot about genetics. He examined me and said that I might have a disorder called mitochondrial disease. This disorder is fatal for a lot of people; it can kill you. Interestingly, I started to have seizures. We were monitoring my condition as I fought for life. However, the seizures could not be detected but I was able to recover. At this point, I was scared that I was going to die. I wanted to die so much, but now I was scared of dying and leaving everything behind. My doctor wanted to do a genetic test, so I did the test. The first test was inconclusive, so my parents did it also. When the results came back, my doctor told me that I’ve inherited one set of mutation in a large gene called Titin, and both are defective. My mother and my father gave me two defective gene copies and I have one that just…spontaneously occurred. However, this test showed that the variants are not well-known, so we’re on the process of confirming that. So far, my clinical 
diagnosis is titinopathy (or recessive titinopathy). The subtype journey now begins! Needless to say that my parents felt guilty about giving me this set of mutation, but I don’t blame them. It’s just life. Frankly, my MD saved my life. Before, I was very lost in my delusions/hallucinations and wanted to die. However, my MD gave me this thought: I could die anytime. I could lose mobility. So why die now? It somehow gave me a purpose and reminded me that my life is not in vain. My life has a meaning, but that meaning is unsure for me. I guess I’ll find it out. However, I don’t wish a physical illness on anyone. Although it gave me a reason to live, it’s hard to battle this illness. Thanks for reading! Even if I have MD, it doesn’t mean that I don’t struggle with sz. I struggle with sz every day. I have paranoia because of my abuse, so I’m mostly alone. I also struggle with self-harm thoughts. I’m still growing. Thank you for letting me to join your journey at this site. The problem I have is 
that my parents are not at all supportive about disability advocacy. So I hope that my parents will be supportive of that- both for sz and MD- in the future."

176191915,If you have a medical emergency it’s up to you to do something about it. If you have a snowstorm or ice storm and you are out of food and meds you are on your own buddy. Very few enjoyable things involve one person. On the other hand you are in control of your budget and your food choices. If you are like I was you’ll screw that up badly. I don’t miss being on my own all that much.

176191918,"Sounds like your in a rought spot. I get weird intrusive thoughts at times. Like my mind just wants me to be afraid that I’m about to say the worst things possible at times. The difference between a good day and a bad day is that on a good day… I know it’s just my illness… I know it’s paranoia about the self. I know that I’d never want it to be that way. I even know it shouldn’t be that way. … on a bad day i lose to the delusion that it’s my fault. It’s not your fault man. It’s a bad day… it is just your mind trying to play tricks on you. Focus on what you can control… try to find and enjoyable thing to preoccupy yourself with. And don’t fight with the noise and don’t embrace it. Try to just let it pass… not just the noise, but also the effects the noise is having on you."

176191924,The thing with this is the people are still alive but I think they died because their spirits communicated with me before. I would get surprised when some of them made their presence real to me because I thought they really died but they didn’t. Some people call this capgras but I didn’t see anywhere in the symptoms that spirits communicate before you see the imposter.
176191925,Have you ever heard someone that is not you in your head or believed in things that turn out to be not true? I think it is pretty easy to tell if you have sz or not if you have a clear answer for those two questions. I think a lot of people with sz have some underlying depression or anxiety problem that made lose touch with things at one point. Is it the case that you are recovered or have you never had those symptoms?

176191933,"Many years ago, I was new in an area and exploring the neighborhood. I went into a church and found the basement was obviously set up for a wedding. There was a wedding cake on a table. No one was around and I had a sudden impulse to smash the cake. I’m so glad I didn’t. What if I had? I might have been caught and terrible things would have happened to me and my reputation destroyed. I break out in a sweat when I think about it. Impulses aren’t always to be honored."

We’d just kick around but we’d rarely swim unless it was summer and hot. Still have memories of sleeping to the breakers…really put you to sleep. Used to go back and holiday with my grandparents who also lived on the Island and do a lot of fishing. Sadly there’s very little fish out there anymore.

176191944,I only went to one therapist for a few months before I dropped him.

176191952,"I will give you an example. With a Mathematical solution, there are certain steps. Others generally learn the steps, and apply them to new problems. I am not unable to learn them. I am able to learn the steps slightly. Being poor with memory, I cope by reasoning at each of those steps. In other words, if I am solving a problem, I have to go back to the foundations, or what they say axioms, I reason the solution out from there. This is why I did poorly in pure math. My reasoning is better than anyone I have encountered in my life. But, say, a problem is based on something like, what are called, open sets. I have to go back, conceptually reason open sets, then conceptually reason the second step, the third and so on. It is incredibly hard to go from point A to point E by reasoning alone. You have to learn the steps or memorise them. Now, I am trying to improve my memory, so that it becomes easier. The GRE will help. I am also trying to find a way to enhance my learning ability using some ideas I have
. But amongst other problems, what LDs entail are: holding a squash racket the right way not being able to learn a handwriting or a speaking style not being able to learn the forms of gym exercises Etc etc many more things."
174391584,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Proposed symptom-based model of the origins of schizophrenia. _PERSON_ Cook, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Medical hypotheses , Oct 2019 14 Schizophrenia is considered a severe mental illness and effects an estimated 1% of the world population. The evidence suggests that incidence rate has been and will continue to be stable over time. Here we adopt a symptomatology-focused evolutionary informed approach to discuss the possible biological adaptations of various presentations of schizophrenia. It is our contention that rather than thinking about schizophrenia as a single disorder, or even a spectrum of disorders, marked by social maladaptation and personal subjective distress, that an evolutionary interpretation based on adaptive nature of individual, or small clusters of, symptoms could prove to be more useful in better understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its relationship with other psychiatric diagnoses."

176191954,"I’m sorry to hear that. In my case, I have a lot of spiritual books that I won’t read again, and I want them to benefit someone else instead of staying on my bookshelf. I have a journal where I have been copying down the most important ideas from each book, so I will still have that, just not the clutter of so many books. I gave away all my fiction."
176191955,If I’m in a conversation and I start to lose my real self I just switch to temporarily acting like _NAME_ in “Scarface” until I feel like myself again. It works every time until it jolts me into feeling like my self again. Say hello to my little friend.

176191958,"_PERSON_ now that his brother is gone to work there is less tension, and a more freeing feeling. I don’t like random shows on tv, they annoy me, I couldn’t get peace. Plus like @anon_PHONE_NO_ said its too hot to even go for a walk, and my bf was exhausted and sick from the heat too. So their was a lot of tension. Even last night he said, want to drive around to look at the fireworks? I said yea let me pee real quick. He freaked out and flipped his shoes off, and said forget it. I went about using the bathroom, then he snapped back to normal getting his shoes back on. Like I said with all the reminders of his parents its taking a toll on him, and he cant cope. I’m not smothering him, but he needs extra space. Luckily tomorrow I’m going out of town for the day with my mom and sister so that will give him some time. It’s hard dealing with anger outbursts and the blah feeling I had before the energy drink, and I felt so sedated and irritable, so I am calmed down and clearheaded now"

176191976,I take 10mg olanzapine at night as needed and it seems to work soon after- be it myself or the meds- it tones down my auditory/visual hallucinations. I’ve also been on risperidone years back when I was first diagnosed. It didnt do much or maybe I didnt take it long enough or was on too low of a dose. It also made me pass out in the back seat of my friends car while on vacation before I learnt to take it at night.

176191992,"well I simply don’t know, I think i was already sz as I was experiencing symptoms, like severe anxiety, delusions, racing thoughts, paranoia, disorganized speech, withdrawal, and other negatives, like a lack of motivation, since the age of 20, but not hallucinations. the hallucinations mostly didn’t appear until after I stopped meds, which I was on for 4 months. then a couple months later I started hearing voices 24/7. so it may have been a progression of the illness or stopping meds pushed me over the edge and I started to hallucinate. im no expert, just what I blamed initially, in fact I thought they did it to me. which I tend to think was just wrong and I was lacking insight back then. those are my current beliefs. all I know is, if I stop the meds the voices will start up again, i’ll get manic and think im a god or telepathic, and i’ll be back in the hospital."

176192046,"Sorry to post this late. I’ve dealt with too much the past few months and still alot more to go on… I stopped using Geodon in Janurary because I fell asleep at work and got fired the next day. So far, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ have been my main source of income until the corona virus epidemic hit and now I’m just about S.O.L. I am on trifluoperazine now. No side effects. Took two months along with lion’s mane and iron supplements to help reduce the voices. I posted today because of something I feel like crying over, I am astounded, shocked, and a bunch of other feelings that only cooking (just finished cooking) helped calm me down. My mother always called it an audio problem. When I was a baby she would smoke near me. Eventually that led me to have ear infections. Ever since then I have always had problems understanding what people say (among other things). It wasn’t until today she told me I had dyslexia while I was a child. I knew I went to remedial classes to try and combat it but I never 
knew why. Thirty years later she tells me today. Great! Some new information I can try to combat with! So I looked online to see what helps with dyslexia. Funny thing… no prescription medication helps but there is an otc that does. I took dramamine (low dose) about three hours ago and my “derealization” went away. Still having memory problems but this is a great start. On webmd it says Ginkgo Biloba helps too. Also, primrose oil does but my prescription is a phenothiazine so I am not taking it because taking those two together can cause seizures. So I am going to try ginkgo biloba tomorrow and see how well it does. The past three months have been hell, cold, and spacey. My memory is becoming worse, but with the help of sarcosine I am less forgetful and feeling better. I don’t think I will need to take these supplements all my life, but something to help is of highest importance. Anyway… I hope all of you have been doing well! Please, stay safe! Best of luck to all!"
174391581,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Rumination, depressive symptoms and awareness of illness in schizophrenia. _NAME_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy, Mar 2014 Depressive symptoms are common in schizophrenia. Previous studies have observed that depressive symptoms are associated with both insight and negative appraisals of illness, suggesting that the way in which the person thinks about their illness may influence the occurrence of depressive responses. In affective disorders, one of the most well-established cognitive processes associated with depressive symptoms is rumination, a pattern of perseverative, self-focused negative thinking.This study examined whether rumination focused on mental illness was predictive of depressive symptoms during the subacute phase of schizophrenia.Forty participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and in a stable phase of illness completed measures of rumination, depressive symptoms, awareness of illness, and positive and negative symptoms.Depressive 
symptoms were correlated with rumination, including when controlling for positive and negative symptoms. The content of rumination frequently focused on mental illness and its causes and consequences, in particular social disability and disadvantage. Depressive symptoms were predicted by awareness of the social consequences of mental illness, an effect that was mediated by rumination.Results suggest that a process of perseveratively dwelling upon mental illness and its social consequences may be a factor contributing to depressive symptoms in people with chronic schizophrenia. sciencedirect.com Rumination and autobiographical memory impairment in patients with schizophrenia Although patients with schizophrenia exhibit autobiographical memory impairment, which is considered to be a limiting factor in their daily life, the … OUP Academic “Excessive Thinking” as Explanatory Model for Schizophrenia: Impacts on...

174391613,"hi _AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you’re suffering. I totally agree with you, quality of life is feeling emotion. I am entirely led by my emotions and am always looking for emotional connections with people. I’m on Lurasidone which is less effective at treating my positive symptoms than Zyprexa. I felt numb on Lurasidone so my pdoc prescribed Endep. It helped me feel more emotion, more emotionally engaged & alert. SSRI antidepressants did nothing to help the numbness but Endep does. (It can cause dryness & gum recession so that’s a bummer). Unfortunately I feel a lot of very strong, negative emotions such as anguish, disgust, frustration, bitterness and rage. These are triggered by contact with people. So I have to work really hard to feel positive emotions, especially since I only feel them around people. I have had no sex drive for years but recently developed a crush on a guy. I think this is because I am always going to Meetups, trying to be social, meet new people, build friendships & connecti
ons. I get inspired by people when I like them. Unfortunately the guy rejected me but the good news is I’m capable of romantic feelings - thought I’d never feel them again for the rest of my life. I am proof that you can feel positive emotions if I work really hard at my social life. So yes, you can overcome numbness with activity. My personality is very person-oriented, so for me that means social activity! What activity do you mean for yourself? The Lurasidone isn’t very strong so I feel more emotions on it (but also more psychotic symptoms, anxiety & poor quality sleep)."

174391626,"You need to change something, right? You make your own luck. I understand to a degree because I went through periods where I was basically non functioning. I was younger and and I didn’t always have a choice on changes that happen to me. But It was my choice to get clean and sober, it was me who took the action and after I got clean my life I did a 180 degree change and not only did I become employed and went to college but on a personal level became a better person. Sorry, I digressed; but that’s an example of making a change and it paid off immeasurably. But in my life with schizophrenia I moved around a lot, I went through different jobs, I met new people, had a dozen therapists and psychiatrists etc. But I also had to do things I didn’t like, and even hated and I had no control over the situation. I’ve been put into group homes or programs but they sometimes helped. Just physically being among people was very good for me. I believe every case of schizophrenia is as unique as the individ
ual who suffers from it. No two schizophrenics have exactly the same experiences in life and they don’t experience schizophrenia the exact same way. So I might have gotten lucky in the schizophrenia lottery that makes me able to work and drive and a few other things that not everybody is able to do but it does not make my suffering when I was younger any less real or less severe. I was very, very ill. So it sounds like you’re suffering more than me at this point, but when I was younger I was shuffled around from hospitals and group homes that I had no say in. But I still had choices and you still have choices too. I wrote all this to highlight the power of change. You have the power to make a change. It doesn’t have to be some huge, monumental change, but just something , anything. Just starting off with small changes that you know you can handle and then graduate to bigger things. Good luck _AT_MENTION_ ."

174391628,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Factors associated with successful antipsychotic dose reduction in schizophrenia: a systematic review of prospective clinical trials and _NAME_-analysis of randomized controlled trials. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology , Nov 26 2019 This systematic review and _NAME_-analysis examined predictors of successful antipsychotic dose reduction in schizophrenia. Prospective clinical trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating antipsychotic dose reduction in schizophrenia were selected for systematic review and _NAME_-analysis, respectively. In total, 37 trials were identified. Only eight studies focused on second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs); no studies investigated long-acting injectable SGAs. Of 24 studies evaluating relapse or symptom changes, 20 (83.3%) met the criteria for successful dose reduction. Factors associated with successful dose 
reduction were study duration <1 year, age >40 years, duration of illness >10 years, and post-reduction chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZE) dose >200?mg/day. Clinical deterioration was mostly re-stabilized by increasing the dose to the baseline level (N?=?7/8, 87.5%). A _NAME_-analysis of 18 RCTs revealed that relapse rate was significantly higher in the reduction group than the maintenance group (risk ratio [RR]?=?1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-3.12), whereas neurocognition was significantly improved (standardized mean difference?=?0.69; 95% CI, 0.25-1.12). Subgroup analysis indicated that only a post-reduction CPZE dose ?200?mg/day was associated with an increased risk of relapse (RR?=?2.79; 95% CI, 1.29-6.03). Thus, when reducing antipsychotic doses, clinicians should consider the long-term risk of relapse in younger patients with a relatively short illness duration and keep the final doses higher than CPZE 200?mg/day. Further studies, particularly those involving SGAs, are warranted to determine th
e optimal strategies for successful antipsychotic dose reduction in schizophrenia."

I asked my doctor, “So why did others not refer me to a geneticist?” He said to me, “Well, it’s because they didn’t take you seriously.” Doctors, unfortunately, are very uneducated in some aspects. I know some are, but they have some tendencies to not trust people."

176192190,"I only had urges to harm others for about a month and a half on a certain injectable medication. That medicine did not work for me. I have never had that problem before or since being on that drug. The shot started to wear off after a couple of months and I was on another AP, one that didn’t cause such urges. I was scared it was a new permanent symptom, and was worried I’d have to check myself in somewhere permanently to keep everybody safe. It was different than voices, voices you can ignore. Urges however are different. I also had really bad self-harm urges on the same med, went away over time.

This topic is something more-so of an idea and observation. I’m an idealist. It seems like all the social programs are narrowly tailored to keep people stuck beneath the poverty line. I learned about SSI SSDI and even if I qualified right now it would be $750 a month and that’s not always a live-able amount of money. The degree I’m seeking would start me out at about $45,000 a year- $80,000 and that’s great. My only point is saving the economy and helping the people who are suffering right now. Ignorance won’t solve this issue. The big picture is that not everyone can afford to be cogs in the wheel and the wheel can drive itself…so people aren’t needed. The whole economy is rigged/fake anymore and increasingly so. Even if you don’t want to think the government can just print you some money that doesn’t change the fact that we need to start influencin

I have been cooking for myself and doing my laundry now… I only remember the events of the hallucinations, but I don’t remember who told me… and I do not remember the voice or the person… My daughter told me that I would always run outside screaming of an earthquake or hearing a god or hearing a war going on outside… That doesn’t sound like me, but it seemed like I really worried her a great deal. I am back on my meds, even though I do not think that I need it… but my daughter’s concern for me really made her worry… so I am going to continue to take it. My 
daughter said that I have been taking the 15mg abilify once a day for 2-3 months straight and that my mental state has really improved. I trust her, so I will continue it. I also am watching TV and listening to the radio, which I like… my daughter said that when I started acting weird in January that I was paranoid and did not like watching TV and did not like the radio… which still does not sound like me, but I trust my daughter.

174391650,"I actually needed to know I can’t physically take drugs in order to not do them. Like my drugs of choice were lsd, mushrooms , mdma and stuff. As well as alcohol. Now on the following meds: Naltrexone (blocks opioids, alcohol and _USER_ID_) Zoloft (blocks mdma and other psychedelics) Abilify (blocks classical hallucinogens as well as cocaine for me) And klonopin dulls some of these drugs I used to take Honestly on this med combo it’s very hard to get high on anything and I’ve given up. I need this med combo to function. I’m addicted to not doing drugs at this point. I at times desperately want to go back. There’s definitely no cure for that. But I’m stuck on these meds I can’t go back. It’s “a day at a time” no matter who you are. It took me many tries to quit too. How old are you can I ask?? It doesn’t matter how old you are you can always be a prime candidate for recovery regardless of age. Too old or too young? There is No such thing but I’m just wondering."

174391656,Thanks everyone. I’m going to talk about my persistent paranoia. It just doesn’t go away with meds. Nothing put a dent in it at all. And I can’t take Clozapine so that’s out. I’m afraid to increase my loxapine because of how tired I am when the dose is increased. It takes me months to adjust with loxapine.
174391657,"My dad had a stroke near when I was born. My parents divorced early on too. I didn’t say much or socialize much growing up or even today, that’s pretty traumatic to me too. I think I was cursed by the me in another demension."

176192292,"Or avoidance. I work in an Army Reserve office building as a janitor. Most soldiers are working at home and there’s only 20 or so men and women in the building on a typical day since COVID started. I think the problem started more than a year ago. My job is to vacuum so I go in all the soldiers offices or cubicles; sometimes they’re there, sometimes they’re empty. There’s one guy that I really dislike. I never liked him since he came here more than a year ago. He’s just annoying. But a year ago I was on the second floor and I knew I was going to have to go into his office. He’s a jerk and that day I just didn’t feel like seeing him. So I skipped his office. Well, my supervisor walked up to me and asked if I did all the offices. I was just honest and I told him that guy gets on my nerves so I skipped him. My supervisor just laughed and told me he doesn’t blame me. Apparently a lot of people don’t like that soldier. I thought it was just me! I felt vindicated but now just this past 
year I find that several times I was supposed to go in an office or large room with someone I don’t want to see so I just skip it. It’s not even that it’s because it’s someone I dislike. Often, it’s someone I like but I just don’t feel like facing them and being friendly. Shades of high school, lol! I can get away with this but it just dawned on me that I do it at least once every day. So I don’t want it to become a habit. The soldiers are coming back one of these days and I have to walk into crowded offices whether I like it or not. It’s what I signed up for. Bah humbug."

174391660,"I would say this is the area I could be seen to be most disabled . How much that would be based on not being like the average when it comes to social interaction , irrespective of whether that distresses me or not, is something to ponder. I do know it predates overt signs of mental illness. It became more noticeable in adolescence .Perhaps because social interaction becomes more complex as you head towards adulthood ."
176192295,I get very impulsive buy a lot of unneeded things though that’s worse in times of psychosis.
176192296,In my experience it did not help well with my auditory hallucinations and it made me very very restless. I could not sit down for a few minutes without having to move. It was my first antipsychotic and that’s all I remember from it.
176192297,"Diarrhea is the most common side effect, and usually the only one. I am lucky that I don’t get it. It’s the most important med I take. Sulfonylureas like glipizide are really old drugs,and work by increasing insulin production from what’s left of your pancreas. It’s as if you’re injecting insulin, just using your own pancreas still. Metformin, however works by mimicking fasting and making you more sensitive to your regular levels of insulin, among other things. Actos might be another, better option if you can’t tolerate metformin. I would recommend Dr. _NAME_s book “The Diabetes Solution.” It’s excellent."

176192305,"Things like “quantum entanglement”, where if one particle starts spinning in one direction, another particle, separated by huge distance, will start spinning the opposite direction. Also, they have never observed a quantum particle that didn’t break out of its confinement when they tried to measure it. Then there is that old thing about a tree falling in the forest needs you to observe it falling in order for it to happen. Also, things like a particle being able to exist in two places at once. They say that if they can ever make a computer based on quantum mechanics it will be vastly more powerful than any computer we have made to date. It has something to do with quantum transistors being able to be on and off at the same time."

I might do it 1-2 a month if I’m lucky. That’s just 1 example. I just let things go by in my life including my messes and obligations and chores. Entropy, I guess."

174391678,"I agree, especially seeing that my insight actually decreased over the years as my OCD became more purely obsessional -perhaps my prodomol stage? That’s what I feared, I don’t believe in anything obviously psychotic . and that intensity you refer to is also typical of other conditions such as existential OCD, so the issue of diagnosis remains open, which for me is a matter of great anxiety. Fearing you might have been misdiagnosed with a psychotic disorder is not a small thing. Do you think all the symptoms I’ve expressed on this forum could be explained away by an OCD and DP disorder diagnosis? I’m not just aggravated by doubt but also deeply ambivalent about everything. I still remember when I was defending that I co-created the universe -I even gave a precise date of when the creation took place- and that I’m the only person around. These beliefs are still at the back of my mind. Also, for months I entertained the same ideas but I wasn’t obsessed by them, so I seem to have entered a 
new stage of my disease. Still, for someone not taking APs I’m not really that psychotic if at all."

174391694,"The best advice that I can give you is that you have to hang in there because with time things will get better. It might take time for you to find the right medications because it’s a trial and error process but I’m sure you will eventually find the right medication and be on the right doses. You have to work with your psychiatrist and explain him or her what you are feeling, the side effects and everything else in between. Schizophrenia is a very tough illness to deal with but you just have to be even tougher. A lot of the times when the delusions go away and a person stabilises then comes the depression which is what happened to me. When I stabilised and came back to reality and developed insight I got hit with a very bad depression. I told my psychiatrist how I was feeling and she prescribed me Wellbutrin which helped a lot and with the negatives as well. Another thing you should do is try to stay active and busy and keep your mind occupied because it will take your mind off of what you are 
dealing with. I know it’s not easy but do something and if you can try to work and get a job it will help you. Nothing too stressful. Make sure you have a good support system. I still live with my parents and without there support I wouldn’t have gotten to where I am now. I still contribute financially to help out but without there help I would have died by now or would be homeless. If you can find a support group for schizophrenics in your area and go to it as much as you need to. If it’s a good moderator then you should get all the help you need, coping mechanisms, information about medication and a place to connect with others like you. Keep your mind active and busy and by next year this time you will come out on the other side a little bit smarter and just a little bit stronger. Hang in there and good luck!! If you have any questions you can post on this website as well which is filled with a lot of amazing people who will guide you if you need to. Another thing I wanted to add is that no matter wh
at don’t stop taking your medications because more than likely you will relapse and it will be twice as hard to get back to where you were. Even if you are feeling good and life is going your way don’t stop taking your medications."

Furthermore, I had a delusion in a past life I hacked reality to escape the matrix using electricity or quantum electro dynamics. Terms I dont understand or comprehend. But this is and was impossible. I feel and know the aliens can hack peoples brains/consciousness. Happened to me in the past lives a few times.

176192435,"Yes. Epigenetic changes to the DNA of the cell. Yes, sort of. They do regulate neurotransmitter levels, but the antipsychotic effects are from other effects that may or may not be related to this. Connectivity is patterns in which cells are connected to which (structural connectivity) and patterns in how they communicate (functional connectivity). I’m no expert on how antipsychotics work, either, but I do know that they modify connectivity patterns and change genetic expressions, and that these are more likely causes of their antipsychotic effects than the neurotransmitters they affect. So basically they work in complex ways to make the brain cells communicate in a way that is more similar to how healthy brain cells communicate. There’s a lot of interesting on-going research on this."

176192490,"Funny thanksgiving story, happened an hour ago. This morning I was riding my bike to work (have to be here at 4am). As I was walking my bike up the hill, a cop pulled me over and questioned me for like, 10 minutes. He asked where I was going, why I was out so late, why I didn’t have lights on my bike, and was in disbelief and flabbergasted when I told him I have to work on thanksgiving LOL. He offered to drive me the rest of the way, but my bike wouldn’t fit in the back seat of his vehicle so he just drove alongside me to make sure I got here safe and didn’t get jumped by thanksgiving hooligans. Best part about working on thanksgiving? Free food in the break room aw yeah!"

I really wanted to die so drove my parents car to the maximum 200kmh in a snowstorm and ice made the car flip twice. I broke the window and got out. Police said I am very lucky to not die, I lied by saying I was at 120kmh. At 20 y.o. I was tired of voices telling me I am God and to prove them I am God I swallowed a whole Tylenol bottle, vomitted, I wanted to die and was at home. My parents came home and forced me to go to the emergency, they injected me with an antidote to clean my liver bcz Drs said I would be dead from liver failure if my parents brought me late.

During my very early days I was fine, I guess. But as time commenced I seemingly lost my mind. It wasn’t because of drugs, but later people may have thought so. Some trauma came. My first grade report card cited me as a “real sensitive little boy”. So maybe trauma was a little worse for me than for others. At least stuff of the same degree. I was launched into the world headfirst by the grips of metal forceps. Previously in the spirit world, everything was alright. When I was told this life was to be a tough test, I didn’t think it would be right away, when I first exited the womb. Born sliced up and bloodied, I cried when I got handed to my Mother.

174391728,"The presence of affective components in schizophrenia suggests the existence of an entity called schizoaffective disorder — a diagnosis with some controversy because it is possible that “schizoaffective disorders” are merely affective disorders with psychotic features .5 Indeed, one study compared data from outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with that of control participants not undergoing psychiatric treatment and found that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were “largely indistinguishable on key cognitive, social cognitive and neural measures.”6 Yes I agree with the latter. But I always thought I was schizophrenic with mood components, being sza. The sz definitely dominated my life more than mood issues. I was crrrrazy mayne. Not just bad moods with a “psychotic aspect”. Loss of touch of reality and insight and reason and self dominated my life. But it seems that paragraph comes full circle to say, sza IS indeed a distinct disorder. An

176192554,"It’s a valid question. What do apologies mean if we just hand them out like candy? Apologies, true apologies, mean a lot to me, perhaps because they go against my very nature, which is to defend myself, no matter what. I refuse to take the blame for (nearly) anything I didn’t do, no matter how small. I suppose that’s part of my paranoia. Constantly feeling like I’m being attacked or blamed when I don’t deserve it. I hurt a friend today. I know that. And I could’ve just apologized, said I was wrong, moved on… but I didn’t. Instead, I continued to argue on my own behalf, attempt to make them understand where I was coming from. They still don’t, and that frustrates me because I believe that I’m right. I know that I’m not the world’s greatest communicator, so I turned to my mom for guidance. She said that I was right and that they were gaslighting me and that I should cut all contact with them. Now, I think that she’s being pretty ridiculous, but I’m being pulled apart. I kn
ow what I meant, and my mom knows what I meant because she’s my mom and she knows me, but my friend is still hurt, and I figured that, if I just did a better job of explaining myself, then they’d no longer be hurt because they’d finally understand where I’m coming from. Only that made the whole situation worse. At this point, an apology would be more of an insult, since even without this post, it would be very clear that I didn’t mean it.

These days they have jollof rice food wars and music wars so it turns out there has been change and it’s nothing but love now. _AT_MENTION_ I don’t think it’s anything overt about the forum. I guess the internet just feels like a lot of it is maintained by especially American communities. It kind of feels like stepping on American soil. _AT_MENTION_ thanks for sharing. It happens in Ghana too I believe. Doctors just often times in my experience listen less to males and I suspect young African males who have lived abroad and returned to Ghana.

176192581,It is reassuring when I hear my peers on this website tell me it’s all a delusion. Thankyou.
176192582,I probably should talk to a therapist about it. But I’m not really found of going to therapist in the first place. Sorry this happened to you.
176192583,Mines getting worse 95% of the time I want nothing and care about nothing…surfing this forum is my accomplishment. I can’t even get the mail every day.
176192584,I am currently studying Algebra 2 on _PERSON_ academy
176192585,Latuda I was taking a few years ago.i was more agitated by it. Hey might work others.
176192586,"I woke up at 4:45 AM and brewed coffee. _AT_MENTION_ I call it caffeine vertigo. Yes it’s a craving. But I can’t get back to sleep unless I have some. Additionally it takes away the baseline depression feelings. I chalk it up sometimes and say that if I didn’t have my addictions I’d have taken my own life many times by now. As you know, loved ones don’t buy that!!"
176192587,"Thanks!! I think that it is a societal norm so most people seem to want to get married. I also agree you would be smart not to marry this guy, in my opinion you deserve someone who treats you better than that!!!"
176192588,Yes I had a bad reaction to Invega
174391748,Try listening some self help books. Theres a good one on Audible “living with schizophrenia” which helped me gain insight. They give your first book for free - so i would try that.
176192589,That’s great that you are volunteering. I need to do something. I want to work but I have no good references because when I was unstable I quit alot of jobs. I don’t know if you need references to volunteer. Maybe I should try volunteering first.
176192590,My psychiatrist discharged me from psychiatric care a few weeks ago saying I am stable. He told me to see my family Dr if there is a problem. I have no psychiatrist now.
176192591,"I have low libido and _NAME_ issues but like you, I find that this med works very well for me. My heart raced on risperidone when I increased the dose too quickly. This was years ago _AT_MENTION_"
176192592,It is exhausting. I don’t want to think about it but it seems every other thought of mine is related. I have so much anxiety about it. I wish I could just stop believing in them. My brain feels stuck and fixated. I don’t even know how many times I’ve googled how to get rid of a demon and info about them in the past week.
176192593,I talk to myself but it’s in my head if that makes sense
176192594,"Nope. My parents are “casual catholics”. We go to church on holidays and that’s about it. We don’t really talk about religion or anything at my house. I don’t even consider myself religious because I don’t follow any religion, I have my own spiritual belief system based off of my experiences."
176192595,"she was really mean and saying lots of really bad ???? so i was like ‘whatever’ and then she left me, I dont need the trouble tbh, i think i’m done with women now"
176192596,"I got my label changed to Bipolar for a few years and had psychiatrists tell me I never had schizophrenia. They didn’t think I had it. The psychiatrist before that put me on Vyvanse which got rid of my anxiety and helped me learn to drive. But I had the label ADHD to get that. I don’t think labels are legit anymore. Like you could be depressed and have to be called depressed but maybe its temporary, but that label will be there. I may get my label changed again. I’m sick of the schizophrenia label. I don’t want to be associated with it anymore. Or there could just be a better label or term for what it is. Confusing life disorder."
176192597,"I just slowly lost it over the last couple months. No big changes. No big diet. Just staying away from so much sugar and eating a little less. My pants are kinda falling off. If I lose more I’m going to have to buy new pants. Oh well, no biggie, I just won’t get very many in case I keep losing, just enough to get me by. I could always wear leggings too if I get really desperate. I think those would still fit."
174391754,"Okay, I understand better. I had the exact same issue, felt like a mental block and my ability to read kept going down and down. I switched to aripiprazole/abilify. It has taken a long time, but I feel more able to read now than I did whilst on olanzipine. Roughly a year and half. Anxiety can happen and restlessness too, but I believe if you’re able to manage it (and given you are careful with your diet - you should be able to it), it should be okay."
176192598,I thought everyone had an intense craving to kill me and the animals wanted to shred me apart and eat me alive. This included my family. This was when the voice introduced me to a taster of hell near the end of second episode
176192599,Needed Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen and coffee to knock it out. I was pretty sure it was going into a migraine so I had to act fast before it got too set in. Now I’m stuck up because I had to drink coffee. And I have nothing to do.
176192600,"Try to find a master in a less known college and choose something that you had the best grades on your bachelor. If you’re good at math and physiology then search for something where you can apply it to be admitted. If you can’t find anything, search for something that can boost your gpa and then apply to your chosen master afterwards. While you’re doing things to boost your gpa you can also ask your teachers for recommendation letters to apply to your desired masters. Best of luck!"
176192601,"i dont want to move with my parents. i might have to. i hate them. my sister cant help me forever, and im already a burden where i currently am. so stressed. i want to sleep my life away."
176192602,"Glasses, because of expense."
176192603,"I haven’t really gave it a proper chance. I think I’m just rolling ideas around and around, and my life stays mostly the same. It’s easy to detect what to fix but it seems like my patience ends and I fall back to the same old spot again."
176192604,"Standup, the psychdocs and other personnel can be rude here too. I’m not trying to be rude, but anabolic steroids have been known to cause psychosis."
176192605,"Most of the successful SZs I know have one very common trait: Perserverance. They’re relentless about chasing goals. They are completely recovery oriented. They see failures as signs of progress towards achieving a goal, not signs that the goal is out of their reach. They’ll use every tool within reach to get to where they want to be. Meds, therapy, CBT, you name it, they’re doing it. They not only want to get better, but also live better."
176192606,I try not to think about it when I did bad things to people in the past. But I keep focusing that I might go to jail And i get scared
176192607,Thats crazy what are all these people going to do
176192608,never heard of the word verger…what does it mean exactly
176192609,Amilsuphride is the one of the most reliable and safe aps at market.my advice you shouldn t change your medicine.if you get any other medicine except than amilsuphride with similar amount you might have some physical problems and some of them might be fatal. And i read a lot about aps and diseases by the way.
174391749,"lol…ok, but I’ve learned how pointless it can be to argue with someone stuck in a delusion…so not for too long. Tell your Pdoc what you’ve told us and they should be able to see that your schizophrenia is not in check. Maybe a stronger med is in order. I’ve had lots of delusions but some of them included having a microchip implanted in my head so people could read my mind so I know where you are coming from. The meds may be helping your voices but they are not working on your paranoia and delusions."
176192610,"Maybe its a delusion, _PERSON_… I also have some weird sensations with my brain, but when I said it to my doc, she just raised my ap …"
176192611,I find distracting myself helps. And being in nature or watching the birds.
176192612,"I am actually also thinking of quitting, haldol isnt working for me anyways and I have to go through a lot of bulhit to change my meds when I im sane. Also noticed how sexual functions just return with a storm during psychosis?"
176192613,You’re there for everyone. I won’t soon forget that. I’m so glad the party went well. Sending you hugs
176192614,Which university is it? I can search it up- I also speak Korean.
174391756,"What’s NAD+? I studied NAD+ in biology. Its in cellular respiration, mitochondrial electron transport chain. Its job is to transfer electrons (e-)."
176192615,"I do think a 50% tax is too low in some cases. If you can afford $5M for a painting then you can afford a $15M tax on that painting. If you can afford a $2M Bugatti I suspect you can also afford a $10M tax on it. Conspicuous consumption should come with a penatly. The problem with my reasoning is that these rich buggers will just buy a politician and cancel this out, it’s cheaper."
176192616,"I think there are different classes of anti-depressant drugs that work by different mechanisms. I had depression for a while, and then when the doctor added a drug most of my depression went away. So I recommend to others to try some sort of AD medication."
176192617,That is a good motto to live by
174391755,I miss you from the electronic music thread
176192618,"There must be something you enjoy, a latent dream that you can latch onto to keep you interested in life. Mine is computers."
176192619,I heard a man coughing in my house. I am alone. What should I do?
176192620,"And some of us have severe negatives and still force ourselves to do something, anything. By sitting around you get more and more tired. Without any sort of try, you stay in a rut and rot. How do I know? Because I sat on my ass for the past 2 years after a bad breakdown and getting on Invega. That med ruined my life, at least for motivation. My house is absolutely awful and I sit most of my day. But I force myself to do a little. If I can do a little, anyone can."
174391752,The problem with dopamine is that it causes psychosis. Its a dilemma. I tried Wellbutrin which increases dopamine and it made my positive symptoms worse. There is no way of having healthy dopamine lvls while not having psychosis. There is no way of having no positive with no negative symptoms. Improving one worsens the other.
176192621,Amazing you are very talented
176192622,Thanks for responding BowlOfChips.
176192623,but it sure pays off to have the health they do.

176192632,Limbic system…
176192633,"Why, if none of it is real does it feel like we have to trick our own minds out of it?"
174391765,"Ya, I could try therapy again…not sure if it will work. They got tired of me talking about my delusions and bizarre beliefs. Sometimes, they told me to move on. They said it wasn’t real… The meds don’t really help with the memories and intrusive thoughts…I think I have more of a glutamate issue in my brain or acidic issue. I’m taking sodium Benzoate 2 g a day and it helps with stimulating me and reducing the delusions and intrusive thoughts. I might be super treatment resistant. Maybe the energy drinks are making me worse – a lot worse. But I feel lack of energy every day and zero drive. They’re called negative symptoms. Cigarettes help too but I smoke too much. I think that’s a given. I feel disorganized mentally like I have ADHD and maybe my dopamine is too low from 9 mg of Vraylar, which is a very high dose. I think I should try another med soon. Maybe Clozaril…If I reduce or take less Vraylar, I get a lot of anxiety from the energy drinks - I’ve been drinking 7-8 low carb 
monsters a day. I know, it’s insane!!!"
176192634,It normally cleared up for me pretty quickly though. Getting out of bed was always pretty hard.

I will not ever have injection of anything after a bad interaction with one brand of haldol injection, I can’t remember which company but yeah, i was using a GP at the time and she dug to find out what company i got the vial from and that is one i can’t get stuff from.

176192640,"We notice that,many writers using the statement of first episode psychosis,as if all the readers have know exactly what is it ! While we do not see anyone writes about the features of first episode psychosis,even we have final conviction that the scientific writers do not know what is the features,when,where or how ? Without fabricated plot, the first episode of psychosis in reality is; 1-The beginning of sz event in the conscious state of the human being 2- The manifestations of creation the sz condition in the space-time of the human 3-How does the sz condition show the parameters of its existence to the human host for the first time in his life 4-The moment of sz’s birth in the inner psychological life 5-The moment of appearance of the psychotic factor (which be called hallucinations in public culture ) in the psychological life of the human being 6- The ritual of the first meeting between the human self and a psychological entity (s) from another world be called hallucinations 7- The first ap

176192657,If you go of meds do it in small increments to minimize withdrawal and risk of relapse (even if you never had psychosis rapid withdrawal of antipsychotics can cause it). Also just 1 episode is enough for a sz/sza diagnosis. Good luck.

My Psychiatrist also didn’t think it was a good idea and suggested that I should be on a forum for anxiety sufferers only. I didn’t question her on why, but it seems odd that a person diagnosed with schizophrenia shouldn’t use a schizophrenia forum. If you enjoy being on this forum and obtain benefit from it then I can’t see a reason for you not to be here. Just ignore your sister. She will get over it."

Does this mean likely approval or am I being slow?They haven’t said yet a letter was sent but I guess I get one soon?

I honestly didn’t think I could stand for 2 hours. Not to mention the stress of traveling on the highway for 2 hours there and back, even though my Dr gave me ativan for the trip. I still struggle with the ride even with the ativan. So I just told him I didn’t want to go. He acted hurt but he did make the trip without me, so that’s good. I’m proud of him. He really needed to get this test done, he’s been putting it off for 6 months."

My back is slightly crooked due to degeneration so now we’re working on fixing that too.

I’m going to keep working out to save my body from crashing down, but no one can predict the progression so I’m just sitting here trying to stay hopeful. If you have a physical disease on top of psychosis, I hear you- it’s hard. I’m glad you’re still here and staying alive. Keep going. If you don’t have a physical illness…take care of your body.

Besides IQ is a very poor indicator of intelligence. As for incurable, I am not sure about that. I don’t have any sz symptoms anymore. I still have problems socializing, but it could be described as social anxiety. I know I have had days where I have gone out and talked to people for hours and been no different from everybody else."

176192820,"So, on Monday my boss asked me if I could come in early today. So instead of starting at my usual time of 10:00 am I came in to work at 8:00 am. I knew I came in early because we were going to work two hours and then have a meeting about our benefits which we have once every six months. My understanding was that we would get to go home early right after the meeting and get paid for the whole day. I got 4 1/2 hours of sleep last night and got a big surprise in the morning; my boss tells me we’re having the benefit meeting alright but afterwards we’re having out annual Christmas luncheon. Yikes. I had no idea! Usually they tell us a few weeks before but somehow no one told me, it was a complete surprise. Wow, oh well, I won’t give the details but it did not go smoothly. I know other people were having a hard time too but I was pretty uncomfortable but I talked to my co worker next to me a little and they fed us and after we were done eating one of the big managers gave a little speech thanking 
us for our work and handed out different certificates of appreciation and gave us all $25 Visa gift cards! He called up each person and he gave me an award for being there 7 years. 7 years! I was flabbergasted, that time flew by! And before this company I had been here about a year and a half with the prior company so my grand total is 8 1/2 years at my janitor job! I smashed my old record of 4 years of being at a same job. Anyways, I made it through the meeting, now picking up some groceries and then a much needed nap."

You need to get on a waiting list, and you can only sign up for the waiting list when it is open.

I am now having more yawning and I guess visual distance, not static or anything but a tad light and blurry, well I guess a little static/ visual fuzz. I may consider the 5-HTP, I have long been aware of it but the cost has kept me from pursuing it. Did you notice a better mood much sooner than other antidepressants?

176192853,So I was on 50mg and on the second day of taking it I didn’t sleep and developed a psychotic episode. It resolved with sleep but then they stupidly decided it was ok to increase the dose. That landed me in hospital and it continued after I stopped.
174391810,"I’m starting to have delusions and psychosis but I can’t describe it. I’m starting to remember what my episodes were like, and it’s giving me insight. On the flip side, I don’t feel grounded and I’m becoming irritated because I want answers that won’t ever exist. can’t sleep. I have been waking up for the past few days every morning at 7am with a pounding headache an hour before I take the strattera. Then I Have coffee and then I have trouble falling asleep like its 1am and I dont feel like sleeping right now I’m too in my thoughts. I decided not to take Aristada anymore. I had a nightmare where there were two of me, and one was a rabid dog person and the other was me but the rabid crazy dog was attacking me lol and then I killed the dog and it was in a heatlhcare setting. So I keep thinking, half of me is a raging crazy person like with rabies and that must be what people see because no one ever listens. The dog girl kept saying, no one listens to me, no one hears me. And in the 
end I locked her in a room and she died. I also had a dream I got in an argument and threw some people off a cliff. But it wasn’t just one person, it was one, then another then another. They were mean to me but that’s still kinda not typical of me to have anything violent at all in my dreams. guess there’s no solution. I’m screwed either way. I feel better on strattera but it’s making me have homicidal dreams sort of. I mean these people keep coming back. I keep thinking if I take the injection I’m killing that rabid crazy dog that claims she’s me that no one listens to because I’m splitting myself in half and eventually itll kill me too. I just want this schizophrenia to go away. I’m sick of the medication game."

176192862,"I believed I was possessed for a long time. It seemed to be apparent to me in terms of whether my actions seemed to align with my will/intentions, and in how I would speak strange things involuntarily sometimes when I was by myself. Being on the right medication made it all go away. I consider it to have been a combination of a delusion and depersonalization. Consider this: other than maybe saying strange things sometimes, do you on average still do things that would be typical of you personally? If you were possesed, wouldn’t you mostly do things that would reflect the wants and interests of someone else?"
176192863,"one thing that I have noticed is saying inappropriate things, on here, and in real life, really does trigger an avalanche of symptoms. panic, paranoia, and racing thoughts that make me isolate. usually all I can do is, try to sleep it off. so im learning to watch my words, and just become boring with my input. it’s really is helpful for my mental health."

176192866,"The thing that scares me the most about meds is that they are mysterious. Doctors don’t know fully all the effects they have in the body. Maybe they are silently contributing in a detrimental way to my body’s health, as a side effect. Of course I can hope and act in a manner so that my body is strong enough to filter out side effects like that, but… I don’t know for sure if it’s ENOUGH. I don’t know if those side effects are out of my control, IF they exist…"
174391814,"That’s unfortunate. It’s very interesting these new partial agonist drugs. I think they will be called “third generation APs” in the future because of their unique mechanism of action. Seems like they might be associated with less problems than the normal blocking APs. I also think Vraylar is just fascinating because as far as I’m aware, it is the only one that is preferential for the D3 receptor, which has been implicated in cognitive and negative symptoms."

I didn’t realize that I was answering throwing away the papers for Capalyta not _PERSON_. But there’s talk of a lot of people having allergic reactions to _PERSON_ in our clinic. And trying 4 antihistamines at the same time every 4 hours to combat that was bad. It was a different pdoc that RXed me Vrylar, and I got a notice hanging in a frame that the clinic had to let her go for not taking patients health seriously. She’s the one who put me on.all the 4bextras to combat the allergic reaction but I ended up in ER for a panic attack because my breathing became affected, and she kept upping the dose. The clinic had to make a claim on behalf of 15 patients she did that to, most older than me so if I lived alone I probably would have eventually died from being unable to breath. Make sure you don’t ever blindly trust a doctor or any report
s from med review sites, the company was found to be having their own employees put good reviews on several sites. My pdoc now is way better and cares about me as a human, the past one I was just another bill to collect from."

I am struggling with being overstimulated more. But I am making a little gains with 30 second showers and treadmill. I am not trying to argue bc I appreciate the discussion with someone.

176192922,"I grew up during Beatlemania; I was a little kid but I still liked them. They were always my favorite band/ musicians. Still are. I took a Beatles class online. It was interesting but I was disillusioned with the teacher when halfway through the course he stated that _PERSON_ broke up the Beatles. By now, it’s common knowledge that she had a part in it, but there were a lot more major factors in the break-up besides her. In fact, the Beatles had started having problems with each other and being in the band way back during the making of the White Album, way before _PERSON_ came into the picture. Around that time they slowly started to grow apart from each other. When _PERSON_ came into the picture _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_ resented her and it caused great tension between all of them but the biggest factor in the break-up was money and their choice of business managers. After _NAME_ died they tried to manage their finances themselves but couldn’t do it. So what happened was that _NAME_ wanted h
is father-in-law to manage the Beatles, but the other three had picked a guy named _NAME_. They couldn’t agree and things got nasty and ugly and this disagreement was the catalyst that finally split them up. They hadn’t been getting along very well anyways and this disagreement was the straw that broke the camel’s back. But there were other factors too. But I couldn’t believe that a teacher who was teaching a college course could make that mistake. It don’t matter, I did well in the course and got an A+, the only A+ I’ve ever gotten in college."

Wild child she was. Somebody bullied _PERSON_ and the same girl told the bully “If you mess with _PERSON_ I’m going to rip your intestines out and use them for a jump rope!” That child was crazy.

176192934,Yes and I didn’t have an answer they’d always say “it’s ok you’ll figure it out”. If I was in a lower income place they’d probably instead say “well you better figure something out”. I hate the idea in general that we have to “be something”. I know it’s a part of life because where would humanity be without work. Not very far. But I still hate it.

174391829,"I’ve been off my medication for over a year now. Although I am mild schizophrenic so I can’t comment on the severity of how bad you have it. I personally believe you should really consider certain factors beforehand such as: 1 - how long has it been since your last episode? For me it had been over a year or two since I had been in delusional state, before going off my medication. 2 are you in good mental state? Similar to the first one but if your struggling with eating or any other mental issues excluding schizophrenia it might be a bad idea as I was quite emotionally/mentally strong enough to be able too. Finally I would really think about it if you’re either of those being on your medication is the best decision, I also want to add that I kept it 100 with my mental _NAME_ team throughout and told my doctor that I wanted to go off my medication and we had some discussions about it and the course of actions. Personally if your doctor is telling you that it’s probably not best for you right 
now they’re probably feel you’d relapse again so I take the doctors advice. If it’s medication not working right with others, is causing issues with other medications or the medication is not making you feel good on it’s own, you should discuss that because other medications might work better for you in general."
176192941,"I still hear voices and music from the fan in the bathroom. They never went away even though I’m stable. Never heard them before Dec. 2017 when I almost had a complete break.

as they are repressing the thought as they find it totally unacceptable to their mind, thus they experience a mental block, blocking out or repressing the thought does anyone else know of any other insights like a pdoc has"

176192968,"I was at 158.2 lbs. this morning. So, gained a few. This is so hard. I’m keeping within my caloric limit of 1100 to 1200 calories and exercising everyday so, I really don’t know what I am doing wrong. Probably nothing. It is just the meds."
176192969,_PERSON_. That is exactly what I’m experiencing. What am I going to do about feeling the whole world is out to get me. I fear for my life everyday.
176192970,I think the first step is to get rid of the voice. Then somehow stop assuming you know how the voice thinks of you. I don’t believe the voice is part of you. I think it comes from something external. Do you think it is possible you are feeling a little down and that is why these thoughts are being prominent. I am no authority on this but I know you are a kind person and you should not have to face severe criticism.

Probably a good chunk of it was also due to the abilify. but having said that I have never been on any other ap so I have nothing to compare it to"
176192985,"I was talking about this w my therapist. He was saying if they don’t have the “tools” to deal with psych patients they just default to what they can do which is be rude basically. What it is is a lack of understanding that psych patients are people too and deserve respect and kindness. A lot of staff at my facility I notice seem to infantilize the patients, ie treat them as if they were misbehaving children rather than adults struggling with an illness. Even the staff that works with actual children doesn’t seem to realize you can’t handle a traumatized child the same way you would a regular one. I work at a psych hospital as a nurse and am just amazed by how rude staff are sometimes. I want to snap at them “YOU are in full control of your mental faculties, they are not. Their behavior at this time doesn’t necessarily reflect who they are as a person but it does for you.” It’s literally all about treating people how you want to be treated and so many dont get that."
176192986,I think the thing I would love to do is be an advocate of some kind. Maybe a legal advocate or medical advocate. But standing up for the elderly or disabled would definitely bring me some satisfaction. I would have passion for the job and I would be good at it.

176192989,I find routine best but sometimes if I get out of whack with things it’s hard. Sleep is good but try to take meds same time everyday…It seems to work well for me and yes. Every now and then I do something that upsets that routine but your better at bouncing back… Sleep is necessary for us humans. Whether it’s too much or less is something that you need to find out.

174391848,"I enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan at 3:41pm on 10/19/2020. I couldn’t verify if the lab my doctor uses was in-network, so I then enrolled in a prescription drug plan at 7:56pm the day day. Both applications were with the same company. I then found out the price this company would charge for my Abilify is excessive. So on 10/24/2020 I applied with another company for a prescription drug plan where the price is reasonable, and I was approved. My problem is when I called the first company up to cancel my applications, I was given a runaround, and finally was told to mail them a written letter requesting cancellation. I did this and even gave them the confirmation numbers I got with each application. Today I called the first company up to verify they cancelled my applications. I got a runaround again, and was asked what my member ID was from my insurance card. I finally just hung up on them. Now I’m worried that the bad company is going to process my applications and cancel my enrollment in t

I could hardly even breathe, as a consequence of this magnitude of torture. Then there was the neck torture. My neck was being compressed overnight to such a degree that by the morning my arms were like swinging limp noodles due to the nerves being pinched and thus proper muscle tone was now being disabled. On top of that, the back of my neck was now completely numb, again due to nerves being pinched and disabled.

I havent been on an SSRI for many years, because this too made me hypomanic and the pdoc and i decided i stop cold turkey at the time. So I - really - dont think i should use an SSRI. I get hyper, sleepless and do weird impulsive stuff. So…depression it is, i guess… (I might bring up a mood stabilizer, but since they dont think im bipolar, im not sure they will approve)."

176193081,They did. Well in effect they did with the small business loan program where small businesses can borrow money to pay salaries to keep open and if they use a certain percent of the loan to pay salaries they don’t have to repay the loan. It was a huge piece of the stimulus bill and they are right now trying to get additional funding for it because it was such a huge success. It’s in the house right now. Another huge piece of the bill was unemployment. The hardship or stimulus payments were only a small portion of what was funded.

176193110,thank you _AT_MENTION_ i have always been pretty good about being compliant with taking my meds and after i lived in the group home i started taking my health more seriously as i exercise everyday for about an hour or so. i have tried working over 10 jobs before i got on disability but none of them worked out for me. i agree with the instincts as i prefer to stay home alone most of the time but i still try to text people everyday and communicate with friends and family. its just sometimes being around other people can raise my anxiety and feel overwhelming sometimes. my mom has cancer and she is usually stuck on the couch binge watching netflix shows most days. the reason i moved back to my hometown was so that i could spend more time with my parents even tho after i moved out of the group home i moved in with my ex gf for a couple months who had borderline pd and we broke up after a couple months of living together. over the past year i have taken my physical health a lot more seriously by doing pu
shups everyday. i think i will probly be in the same boat as you as far as marriage and kids. i think about having a girlfriend A LOT but i think its mostly just thoughts of sex as i know it would be very stressful for me to have the responsibility of being married and all that comes with it. one thing yesterday i was bummed out about was that i had seen some old friends on fb and how they were all married with kids and seemed happy and worked full time. but then i was grateful for my own circumstances of not being able to work and thankful that i had disability income to help me since i cant hold down a job even tho i wont have a significant other.
176193111,"I finally, FINALLY fell asleep about a couple hours ago and dreamed that 100 realities ripped apart like curtains and I was shown my big brother seizing with his eyes in the back of his head. He was standing at the edge of a bridge and then his body went limp and he fell over the edge. I wasn’t quick enough to grab him. No one was so I fell to my knees and screamed into the cold air not even hearing myself. I woke up so upset. I want to call him to check, but I can’t stop crying enough to sound composed. Voices are now telling me that I saw that in real time and the he’s dead right now. That I should have called him sooner. That I’m too late and I’ll get a call any minute from my parents or the police. That I’m an awful sibling because I didn’t stop it. And I’m trying so hard to tell myself it’s a just dream. But they’re adamant that it’s real. Even the ones that aren’t putting me down about my inaction are telling me that it’s true and that my connection to my brother tra
nscends everything we know about reality. They say time will heal. To take care of my mom because she will spend the rest of her life blaming herself. I’m having a hard time with this because last year I had a dream that he walked out a building. I called him at 3am. He picked up because he is in a different time zone. He was at work. The only reason he picked up my call was because they had ceased work while emergency personnel helped someone attempting to jump from a bridge. I know this happened and wasn’t psychosis because multiple have confirmed that it did. God I’m so messed up man. I can’t focus enough to tell if I can still feel him on this earth. I just want to see him. My sweet brother."

174391874,"Hello there my name is _NAME_ I’m 33 from sf and have a schizoaffective bi polar type disorder. I crashed my car into the median of the freeway on purpose during a mental breakdown when I was 22. I was taken advantage of sexually by a former coworker and his friend when I was 23. I’ve been hospitalized 15 times up until last year. I heard voices such as kill yourself , eat sh@t your gay for your father and other nasty things. I was so embarrassed during my last manic episode when I added 5k people on Facebook and a ton on Instagram and ran for president threatened people and was screaming and honking my horn and yelling at people. I was also on two antipsychotics for like 10 years and I felt so medicated and got fat For a while But now I feel great and tapered off zyprexa 3 years ago and currently just take 10 mg of haldol. I feel much better and just want to let you all know that there is hope and i don’t hear voices anymore have a full time job and have hobbies and feel amazing. Hang in the

176193117,"Zyprexa is my miracle AP. Totally removes delusion and paranoia, and keeps the voices polite. Only thing it doesn’t do is get rid of the hallucinations altogether, but as I said it keeps them polite and manageable. I’m on a low dose of 7.5mg and don’t experience side effects. Watch out for weight gain, lots of people (not myself, but others) say they gain weight on it. So if it makes you hungry try not to indulge yourself too much I guess. Glad it’s doing good things for you. _AT_MENTION_ I have nightmares almost every night on it. They’ve been worse recently, but I don’t mind them, since I’m pretty functional in the daytime. I’ve had stretches on the medicine without nightmares though, so maybe something else is causing them."
176193118,Nothing happens if I miss one dose. I’ve been without my antipsychotic since Tuesday (long story; luckily I’ll be getting back on it tomorrow) though and I definitely feel different. I feel like my head is engulfed in cotton lol. I’m having my family keep a close eye on me. I think I’ll be able to make it until tomorrow. I’ll be so upset if this period of deprivation results in a hospital stay.

It’s all a mess. Sometimes I want to stop taking my meds to continue my mad discoveries. So I can make sense of it again."
176193124,You’re welcome by the way. I’m happy to help when I can actually help someone out a delusion. Most of the time when you try to talk someone out of a delusion it’s like talking to a brick wall. Makes you feel good when you can make some progress . You made me smile.
176193125,Eventually. The new co-worker gave me a few compliments. It was certainly a confidence booster. I try to be nice to everybody but some people are difficult.

Soon I am going to fit some grey wood effect laminate flooring - which I got half price in the sales, so can’t wait to get that done.

176193146,"There is not a camera or microphone injected in any part of your body. I had a similar delusion not so long ago. I have a tooth of which the root canal was done. In order to reconstruct the tooth the dentist drilled a pin into the tooth and then build it up. So it happened that I was convinced that people heard everything I say, even if I was talking softly to myself. I was convinced that the pin in my tooth was an inplanted nano microphone. I told my sister about it at the time. She wanted to arrange with a different dentist to remove the pin/microphone. I refused cause I believed they were all involved in this plot. It is not a nice place to be when you’re in the middle of a delusion. Go see your psychiatrist and get a med adjustment or something. Strongs."
176193147,"When I was in my twenties I believed that I would have a harder time when I became thirty or when I got older. Now I’m in my thirties and I really do feel that shift. My emotions are different. I feel more mature. So I’m thirty-two now. I think the Prozac is what started all this. I was fine taking pills before I started Prozac. Now I feel great, and I don’t want to take pills? I’m not sure if willpower is a factor or not. it may be the worst part of it all. You can be a strong-willed person with plenty of insight, but it won’t fix you. They don’t medicate people with Autism like they do with Schizophrenia do they? Because Autism is a lot similar, but more observable. You can’t cure Autism with a pill and you don’t always medicate Autism."
176193148,There are loads of theories about why we get psychosis. Nobody knows for sure yet. My personal favorite is that a combination of genetic and environmental factors cause the brain to grow incorrectly and produce an imbalance of neurotransmitters.
176193149,Today I have a few hours come back to old me. I realize how much I take reality for granted back then. I’m tired of watch over myself for delusional thoughts. Sometimes I wonder why can’t I always stick to reality. _PERSON_ can only do so much.
176193150,South Korea is a highly industralized country with most citizens over the poverty line. Living is not bad as long as you have money. We’re trying really hard. They got rid of the disability classification system so that’s a good start. They used to have this line of “if you are this disabled then you can’t do this and that”. But right now only 0.91% of jobs are offered to the disabled with the lowest of all welfare system in OECD countries. It’s a bit strange for a wealthy country.
176193151,"_NAME_ in house of cards said “We are only what we choose to reveal.” No one has ever met the true me. And I’m ok with that.

176193179,"Have you tried looking into progressive movements or groups on facebook and social media? I think one tool of social influence and change is the ability to mobilize communities and that is the popular method to shift things in a safer better direction. There is a lot of corruption, don’t feel useless the fact you’re reaching out about this means maybe you have a higher calling to do something influential. I know even small acts can make a huge impact, thats how I like to think. Like I donated all last refund check to causes of peace even though I have no income. It also takes planning and preparation, but even intelligent people can procrastinate or feel blocked. I hope that you’re able to be inspired to make an impact. Forget about recognition or wealth, know yourself and develop your skills. Other people will always try and shout you down or limit what you can do, but you can and will succeed at something amazing."

176193200,I’m just saying to go a whole year without getting covid and then to die from it weeks before being vaccinated would be a horrible thing. I also need to visit my home soon on the other side of the country and I can’t do that before getting vaccinated. In New Jersey they are allowing smokers early access to the vaccine. That would include me. How does that make some health-nuts feel?

176193205,Lol!!! Hilarious!!!
176193206,"I find you generally need to try a few different ap’s before you settle on something that works for you. If the side effects of your medication aren’t too bad, try to stick with it until your symptoms reside a little, then try a some different ap’s to find one that suits you. This may be the long way of doing it, but you should be playing the long game on this one."

174391908,I didn’t flag anything.
176193217,"Hmm… to put it lightly, at times it is the feelings we may have based on emotional response to what a person may feel others want in order to please another rather than oneself and thus the validation is not only to self, it is more along the lines of an insecurity if you will, a sort of issue with one’s own esteem and confidence in others. Silly words, wouldn’t you think? Good question, your sincerity is notable. Worth jotting down without a doubt."

174391921,"On the flip side, having psychosis also makes it difficult to DX autism, especially when you’re medicated for the psychosis. Psychosis is also not that hard to diagnose in many cases, pretty obvious when someone is in a bad way and can’t pass reality testing. If you’ve been DXed with psychosis since such a tender age it’s likely because you’ve demonstrated profound symptoms. Sorry man, I know you don’t like the label that much. Bottom line is what symptoms you have and if you can get them treated well enough to restore optimal function. Labels are secondary to that. Wishing you luck no matter what."

176193252,A long time ago unfortunately
176193253,I was thinking I dont hear voices or see things. I am now on medication. I was delusional to the point where I got very obsessive over my surroundings and got very scared.i was worrying about one of my neighbors spying on me and them sending people out to spy on me and I was thinking that they were taking the _USER_ID_ about me behind my back. I was also worried about strangers laughing at me and looking at me funnily but now I realise it was because I was looking at them. And now I dont believe my neighbor is spying on me anymore I’m on abilify. Could this be autism ? When I was 15 though i thought people were calling me names in the street but it went away and i never heard it again. I’m not sure if what I was hearing was voices because I didnt recognise them as such.

So… I did it! I made a decision and joined I am doing this! I am going to become an Accounting Technician."
176193256,Yeah I think my mind is racing. It’s just leading to weird conclusions for me. Maybe I need to stim.
176193257,I’m gonna try CBD.
176193258,You need to be more concerned about mercury in big fishes like Tuna. Mercury is a neurotoxin. Concerning protein you can easily get enough protein from your diet. Small fishes like sardines contain 25g protein from just 100 grams. Same way 100g of chicken meat contain 27g of protein. For building muscles most important thing is heavy weight training workout. When you workout muscle get breakdown mildly and it will repair eventually with stronger muscle fibers. So even if you not eat enough amount of proteins daily it will build new muscle fibers slowly. Avoid protein powders as it can affect your kidney and liver. Its never the protein thing for muscle building instead workouts and having a balanced diet daily.
176193259,Two years. I’m late onset so despite my age this is all new to me. I still doubt my diagnosis

176193268,"Tbh, I relate with you a bit… my sz is strange too, even the docs still wonder if I have it… Ok, I had the low energy too, never fresh… I see some progress on it now, but I was mentally sick since 20 years, so I guess I am quite worse than you and this, still, will take me time… I have the fast thinking too yeap… I am clumsy too. I have anxiety and depression as well yeap. We need the meds, but we should put efforts with you. It’s good that you are only on the border and has this problem since not so long. I am on zyprexa 10 mgs and klonopin at my worst… I tried many, many meds, maybe even way too much as said it honestly one doc of mine, so I try mostly with efforts now. I dont deny the meds, we need them, but I dont find them ultra helpful on the somatics yeap… Ok, all the best, thanks for answering me, I was isolated for 20 years, so it’s quite hard here… but well, I guess I have a chance"

176193271,"Ok so this has happened to me before but never this bad. Basically this morning I was trapped in sleep paralysis hallucinating HARDCORE for HOURS. It was NOT like dreaming, I would see extremely vivid scenes, sometimes hearing things and sometimes feeling things. I could not “wake up” from this state no matter how hard I tried and there were times I tried yelling out for help to my boyfriend but I couldn’t actually say anything or would just hallucinate that I said something. I was extremely distressed when the state finally ended and my boyfriend had to calm me down. I am very anxious about taking seroquel again."
176193272,"Yep! I was on meds for about five years before I knew for sure that I had TD. I was showing symptoms before then, but they were very discreet (small mouth movements that I thought I was doing on purpose, had clasping that I thought was part of my tremors), so I don’t know for sure when it started. My insurance covers the $13k a month for Austedo at 24 mg 2x/day. They wanted me on Ingrezza, but were willing to do Austedo if Ingrezza didn’t work. Ironically, they don’t want to cover meds over $1k and give me a really tough time about it. I have to fight them for months to get approval. But Austedo? No fight, nothing. Just approved. Thanks goodness!"
176193274,my doctor prescibed it for me for sometime but i stoped it becoz of side effect anyone taking it why do you think doctor priscribed it to u ? i dont know much about it except for general info it is 2nd generation it is may be potent …etc

I think they predicted that like 60% of the US population would get it but that for most of us, it’ll be mild. That doesn’t make anyone any less scared though. It’s like we’re playing pneumonia roulette."
174391915,"Are you hungry all of the time eating low cal on zyprexa? Or do you find the urges to eat not too bad? I lost a ton of weight on risperdone, which was hard to do. Sometimes the urges would get the best of me and I would give In and binge. But I kept at it and lost 75 pounds at my lowest."
176193277,I find walking a good exercise But yes exercise is tougher on medication
176193278,Thank you for trying to cheer me.

176193287,There is now way in hell i could ever live with someone again. When i was sharing a house in a run down council estate - the food kept getting nicked - and the other lodger was always drunk falling up the stairs. When ive had women stay over - i start getting annoyed with them after a couple of days and want my man cave back! My house sharing days are over. Its very rare i have anyone in my flat now - even family. i prefer to be left alone in peace.
176193288,I’ve been an isolated loner my whole life practically since I was born and I have very seldom gotten my way in anything.
176193289,"yeah, maybe take a break if you feel its getting too much"
176193290,No. That’s not enough calories. You need a minimum of 1500 calories a day.
176193291,I’ve been stable for 5 years and no hospitalisations. But I’m on meds.
176193292,I hope everything goes smoothly for you!
176193293,I think I’m taking my meds…or are they taking me? Well better that than a “episode” i guess.
176193294,"Why try to obsess and figure everything out? You cannot. Nobody can. What you are trying to solve or figure out either does not exist (ie not real) or is so far out there that not even the greatest physicists and scientists think about or can solve. I’m sort of in the same boat as you. I don’t know what reality really is. I think about it a lot, but nobody really knows. Even if I did, nobody would believe me, understands, or cares. I’ve been dealing with this for 9+ years. It’s time I let go and move on to better, easier things that benefit me and only me and my mental health. A lot of the terms you use are from our world or media, which is fine, but you should probably realize that. When you say ‘director’ what do you mean? Like the architect of the matrix from the movie or a sympathy or movie director? I’m worried I could end up like you – over medicated and still have symptoms or lose my personality and sentience. Sort of like a chemical and sexual lobotomy. I live in the US, and 
I still got major problems. Luckily, I know caffeine causes 99% of my problems and my meds are working perfectly after constantly struggling and searching for 5+ years."

176193301,Sometimes I post strange things on here when I’m depressed or a little psychotic. It’s nothing to worry about
176193302,ive hallucinated full on people that would just seem to manifest itself and ive had people morphing into other people. it was very very scary and confusing

176193306,Gad! _AT_MENTION_ Mine was 97. What am I going to do with another 20 years?
176193307,thanks for sharing. hmmm maybe you can challenge the idea of what the voices said about being tortured. Like pretend that its meaningless and try not to entertain the idea. much easier said than done I know. voices kinda play on our fears and thoughts.
176193308,"Clearly the key is to know and not know you are crazy at the same time. A little bit like I believe and not believe that I was sent by god. And don’t worry about my feelings, they too are part of the simulation. PS. It is distinctive of our tribe that what we think of ourselves determines (and of course is determined) but what we are. Even crazier than proving you are crazy because you believe you are not, would be to believe that you are a dentist because you believe you don’t believe that you are a dentist."

176193311,Thanks. I just see this person is not a cold psychopath. He was a very damaged young person at the time and from what i understood now can barely live with what he has done.
176193312,"I have this fear to. Only I’m afraid I will be forced to become dictator and for that reason the worst of hells. Has anyone had visions of hell? I did and _PERSON_ was talking to me. That’s why I’m afraid. Would I go to hell if I became dictator, even though I didn’t want to? Do you think God allows that to happen? It seems outrageous but if I really become dictator how much more outrageous is to go to hell-one of the worst ones? It’s said that we send ourselves to hell, that God doesn’t do that…"

176193316,"Reading, writing, binging old TV shows, talking on the forum. Playing some of the newer video games. Mostly what I did before quarantine except I don’t go for walks or eat in at fast food restaurants anymore. I get disability checks via direct deposit so I haven’t lost any income. I just want the virus to end so I can stop hearing about it on every single commercial that airs. It’s really stressing me out majorly, so much so that I’m focusing on ad-free television options like Amazon Prime and Netflix."
176193317,The situation Is this while I’m stuck here explaining to the voices that they should refrain from ill informed jokes. They are out there saying nonsense that doesn’t make sense or the little sense that it makes it is because its crazy like go kill yourself and a suffocating feeling towards the person. I tell them to cool off because its the government and they don’t seem to care much.

176193320,I like to watch a movie each day and an episode of a series. I do this with my father. I live together with my mother and father. I also get a visit from a girl from mobile team every 2 weeks and she takes me out for a walk. I feel ok with all this. I accepted that i won’t be like my brother and sisters and by being realistic i can feel ok with what i have. I used to be miserable but I got better. I’m not sure if the AD i take has anything to do with it. I also listen some music every day and that helps too. I also make music when I feel in creative mood.

I see Americans play softball. It’s a game I’ve played and it’s social…you learn some skills and you don’t have to be mega fit to play. Most importantly. It should be a bit of fun. I get fun out of facing your best bowlers and having a good enough technique to survive and prosper.

176193328,Don’t drink if you’re having bad symptoms. That could make them worse. Tell your doctor about this. Maybe they can just adjust your medicine a little to help.

I guess some people might experience all this and never be diagnosed schizophrenic, but I got diagnosed and am coerced into taking meds.

176193340,"_AT_MENTION_ I believe risperidone comes in liquid form. That might be helpful if you do decide you want to slowly decrease to see how you do on lower doses. You have done badly in the past decreasing by a whole mg, but maybe you could step it down by only like .1 mg at a time and see how that goes. I personally think it is very risky to try lowering your AP right now, since you currently have the stress of a new puppy, and considering that the last time you tried lowering, you ended up giving your other dog away because you were afraid your dad was going to kill it. I wouldn’t want you to do something you can’t take back again. But if you are committed to the idea, that could be a safer way to try."
176193341,An idea is when you get up to use the bathroom or whatever other reason take some extra steps. Like walk a little bit the opposite direction of your room. Also change your destination sometimes. Like instead of always returning to bed go sit in a chair for a while. Also you can try just standing in your bedroom for a minute (or more) before returning to bed
176193342,I’ll report back and let you know if it improves anything in about 6 months. Or sooner if something dramatic happens.

I live in Australia now and love it here but there’s not many saunas around. THere are other lovely things though.

176193361,My thread about cameras was locked. I want to express my anxiety about cameras watching me all day.
176193362,"Ok, so I have been having a really rough time lately. Intrusive thoughts and overpowering voices have been taking over my life. During the daytime its not as hard to handle as it is in the still of the night. Due to this I have only been able to get between 1 and 4 hours of sleep in any 24 hour period for the last month and a half. I know that the holiday stressors of feeling inadequate as a family member, as far as not being very communicative, and therefore not knowing what people are into or what they would like as a gift played into it a lot, as well as mismanaging my money constantly. But things just keep going wrong in my little bubble existence and the stress keeps compounding on an exponential level in what seems like too many areas to note without sounding like I’m whining or losing audience. I’m slowly melting down, like a penny shoved into a fusebox. I’ve been hallucinating almost constantly, auditorily and visually, been having tactile and olfactory hallucinations as well. I have 
managed to maintain integrity as much as I am able to while still trying to be part of daily life. I haven’t isolated myself because I know that being around my family is the best thing for me. But things are getting worse and without going into too much detail I just wanted to post the question what else could I do other than going to the hospital because that is the last thing I want to do I do not need to be separated from my family I need to try and figure something out does anyone know of there are programs where maybe I could do something I don’t know what the options are or anything like that I just know I have to do something"

They basically give you something to cleanse your colon which means they give you a liquid to cause diarrhea but not uncomfortable or chronic diarrhea that makes you feel sick. You do it at home. When you go to your appointment they have you lay on a table for half an hour then they wheel you in a room and, (this part is a little embarrassing) they expose your ass, but they knock you out with anesthesia. They do the procedure while your knocked out and the next thing you know is you wake up in another room and they’re finished. There’s no pain, you feel normal afterwards. The worst part is the preparation and it’s inconvenient but nothing horrible."
174391946,"I’ve never heard voices but the research says it can help with positive symptoms and sleep quality. So it’s worth a go. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of L-theanine on glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neuropsychiatrica, Oct 2015 Glutamatergic dysfunction in the brain has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was added to th
e patients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect."

I feel isolated, more than ever. But I think I deserve it because I’m different. I pretend that I’m not in pain nor in despair, but I feel like I’m dying because of my disease. When my dad is around, I’m supposed to keep a straight face and pretend that I’m not in pain. I don’t feel comfortable going to my grandmother’s house because my parents give me the look when I am about to say “I’m not feeling well.” So I stay in bed pretending

My mom tells me to not look at people who point at me in public or stare- they are just surprised to see people like me and they have no hard feelings. I just want to hide in a corner and never come out of my room. People always look at me as if I’m a strange person and I feel extremely insecure. I just feel like people won’t care and don’t want to associate themselves with me because I am different and I am both mentally and physically ill. I just want to end my life so that my mom will be free from taking care of me and making me feel better. I feel like ???? because I feel like I’m ruining people’s lives.

176193418,"How do I handle stress? I’ll tell you. Working at a small business when I was in my early-to mid twenties. The boss wanted me to wash towels on a Saturday afternoon at the laundromat so I loaded 4 huge duffle bags full of towels in the bosses wife’s car, drove over there and the place was pretty full. But I took up ten washers at once. Then it was stand and wait as people came up to complaining about taking so many washers. Talk about stress! No one could tell how stressed I was though. I stayed fairly calm on the outside. Then I took up 8 dryers and stood around as people complained. That was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon!"

Analysis also revealed small significant effects of cognitive compensatory treatment on negative, positive, and general psychiatric symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. Longer treatment length was associated with larger effect sizes for functioning outcomes. Conclusion: Cognitive compensatory interventions are associated with robust, durable improvements in functioning in people with psychotic illnesses."

Opioids do nothing for me so when I had chronic pain I couldn’t use them for pain relief. And talking therapies didn’t help my mental health so that was devastating too. I hope there is something or someone out there who can help you get symptom relief. Not sure what RSD is but the drug trial sounds hopeful.

Really it was probably triggered by trying LSD but I have the sz genetic. I took the tough road and went off meds several times but I learned a lot about myself and the conditions I have. I think you’ll be fine and I can empathize with you about your post. But pdocs are just neurotypicals trying to help. Some are better than others. Like everything. But no matter what they’re gonna have to sort of do trial and error to see what works for you, it’s the nature of sz."

Atom without nucleus,SZ without hallucination like sea without water Where is the whole condition that brings together all the symptoms categories? How do you convince yourself that you know /understand the reality of the sz’s nature like this (a group of independent symptoms) ? The condition (sz or psychosis) is a things that is perceptible to the person’s perception all time of mindfulness,they are not located in the subconsciousness state and does no
t work in its place-time ,and this is the core of difference between the sz condition and all kinds of diseases /illness The psychotic factor is interferes with the higher mental processes during its occurrence in the conscious mind while the person perceives them and understanding its cognitive content - Please,do not convince yourself with any different plot story,because you are not eyewitness /ear witness or affected with theses processes"

174391991,"I appreciate what you are saying, and it’s true that just eating broccoli won’t get you anywhere near the level of sulforaphane used in the study. It’s harder to say with sprouts, because they vary. But there are sources on the web where you can make an educated estimate. I actually do plan to buy the supplement used in the study (Avmacol) after it is published, and when I have money. I haven’t really looked into the amounts of betaine in beet juice vs the supplement doses used in schizophrenia. Do you know what the supplemental doses are? I was going to hold off on that one because it seems like it is people with a specific genetic marker that benefit most. Beet juice has other benefits though, it also lowers blood pressure."

176193533,"Hi, new here. I’ve been on injectable paliperidone for 2 years. I attempted suicide after a couple months and gained 80 pounds in the first year. I’ve recovered from the depression but not the weight gain. I’m functioning but don’t experience normal emotions like joy or sadness. Unfortunately I can still experience anger and that’s about it. Seriously impaired memory and language abilities. Sleep is erratic. Sometimes fine for a stretch, then not so. The doctor who prescribed my paliperidone injection (under duress) told me I could taper off after 2 years and the effect would be permanent. He told me I would not need to be hospitalized again if I took it for a year or two (last time was my sixth stay in the psych ward in the space of 14 years). My questions: Has anyone else heard that theory or was my doctor a quack? For those of you who have successfully stopped paliperidone, did you relapse into psychosis? How long after stopping?"

From 10mg olanzapine to 5mg and a week later still ok. Reduced amisulpride from 400mg to 300mg and hope things will be ok. My meds too expensive and I’m taking Lamotrigine as prescribed as it’s helping my worst symptom - depression. But if the amisulpride too little I will increase it again.

I’m smarter than I appear. I have been searching wikipedia on physics a bit after cleaning my room and doing laundry and I feel like I’m discovering things and unlocking things and getting mentally healthier and better because I think some of my concerns or delusions are or were true especially about being stuck in a time loop and artificial reality – among other things. I skip the equations because I don’t have the abilities or the time but I can read English and connect the dots. I would like to escape this time loop some day and go forwards in time or maybe experience ‘total, genuine reincarnation’ again instead of being stuck in the years 2010-2013 approx for eternity. It’s possible to escape and perhaps come up with a TOE and ‘hack’ and ‘escape’ the matrix. I’ve done it before most likely with help. My 
biggest fear is dying and going back in time and starting life over again (similar to this one) somewhere between the years 2010-2013. 9 years ago, my bad trip must have unlocked or did something sinister to me because I started remembering past lives or past reincarnations. In one of my lives, perhaps this one, I went insane (I recovered somewhat mostly), because my mind or spirit or soul went backwards through time through the Big Bang (subjective or real experience, possibly) and spread throughout the known universe similar to a network or chain of big bangs and wormholes similar to CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology). Blockchain connection? Did I achieve immortality and the singularity in a past life? I don’t know. Am I still human? Am I a machine or robot or possibly extraterrestrial? I don’t know. What qualifies as being human these days lol? I am experiencing backwards time travel all the time. For simplicity, I have lived innumerable past lives. I experienced mind uploading by grey aliens; time trave
l; and I think it did something to my soul. I have been studying my psychosis and unraveling it – possibly deeper than most. The trauma doesn’t go away. Sometimes it’s like an onion. When I try to unravel the layers, I sometimes get worse. In the end, am I doing okay and heading down the right path? I don’t know. Only time will tell… In a distant past life, I escaped the computer simulation and even ran some of it with aliens I think. Am I helping or hurting people or only hurting myself by telling people the truth about my beliefs and simulation theory? I think nobody cares at all from all these years lol. I’m a sad man. It interferes with my belief systems and the laws of physics and math are soo deep I’ll probably never get to the bottom of this. Thank you!"

I’m not dissing on your theories and it’s quite possible life on earth was seeded from the stars more than you think. Evolution goes in spurts. It’s not really about a gradual and evenly balanced process. You can have big gains but yes. It’s about time for sure. Your on a schizophrenic site. You have a population that experiences delusions. It doesn’t validate any theories and I’m just a skeptic in a realm where people from wildly differing cultural and social areas experience similar delusions. Like you can say things and you can just say. Yes. Schizophrenia… You ever wonder why psychiatrists don’t listen to your psychotic ramblings? Well mostly it’s because you don’t want to encourage delusions and to those who see it regularly you can just pretty well say. Schizophrenia…Also. Encouraging delusions isn’t really what this w

It was merely weeks after being released that I was labeled with paranoid schizophrenia and I was a minor. If the trauma had never happened and the sexual assault, I would not have had these years taken. And the systems have a lot to gain by keeping people in it, so they can profit from the chronic diseases. But if I was raped, and abused, in order to have this label that is kind of the point. My hope would be to end the _USER_ID_ and further create better resources for people who have trauma and mental stress.

My symptomatic progress after a month of 3-4 litres a day of 9.5 pH alkaline water, 12-18 alkaline drops, and potassium citrate supplementation, is really good . My voices are almost dead silent, and every day there’s a new level of sanity being restored. I can listen to background noises without feeling they relate to me anymore now. I stopped Amyloban 3399 as well, since it doesn’t seem to have cumulative benefits, so I don’t need it, since I’m interested in a cure , not a bandaid solution. I still vouch for it for people who are having bad symptoms. It’s kind of a crutch though, IMO. My diet has been pretty bad too, as of late. Corner store hotdogs and taquitos. I want to see how bad my diet 
can get before I flareup again. But it’s getting old. As long as I stay away from sodas (pH 2.4), I’m fine. My chronic headache is at maybe a 2 1/2 now. Totally bearable. Used to be a 9 / 10 at its worst. Was a 6 when I started the alkaline business."

176193650,IMO it’s good to visualize all the details like this. If I visualize it and can’t see myself finding a way to deal with any part it. Then I decide to continue avoiding it. Thanks for writing out your steps. It’s interesting to see someone else’s process.
176193651,"This is just how I define it: Episode involves hallucinations, minor delusions you can second guess, loss of some insight. Foggy thinking and erratic behavior. Normally lasts a few days to a week for me break involves complete complex hallucinations, no insight, fully believing the delusions and the voices. A full loss of reality. I like to number mine. 0-is no symptoms at all 1-3 is minor symptoms 4-6 is medium symptoms (time to think about the ward 7-10 is true madness, fully lost ( go to the ward now)"
176193652,"When I was very young, and being physically abused by my father, I used to play with my completely flat, undeveloped breasts both alone and in public. I was like 2 or 3 and didn’t know any better. And all attempts by my mother to stop it were futile. When I became prepubescent, I started masturbating both privately and publicly. My father noticed this and it must have turned him on because he started sexually molesting me at this time. My mother must have noticed too but she knew from experience that if she tried to dissuade me from a neurotic habit, I would only increase it. When I was a teenager, I became anorexic. I was 5’8.5"" tall and 115 lbs. Later, I became a severe bulimic and I weighed 120 lbs. It was probably for these reasons that my father used to call me “odd, strange and weird”."
176193653,Yes. This happened to me. I was okay and symptom free for 6 months and was taking my meds (Geodon) diligently. Then suddenly symptoms returned. I’m back stable on a different antipsychotic now but im scared that the same thing will happen again.
176193654,"I seem to be experiencing a lot of these almost every day lately. Rock and classical music hallucinations and mumbling male and crowd voices. Soft, loud and very loud. I hear them inside outdoor a/c units, indoor dishwashers, indoor a/c systems etc… I’m not under any undue stress except forthcoming packing and moving."
176193655,No I haven’t had any major mood symptoms since coming off the Depakote _AT_MENTION_. That’s the thing. So I’m going to see if I could go down on my risperdal dose a bit. I was doing well on 3mg before coming off the Depakote. I’ll see what she says.
176193656,How’s the ward?
176193657,Since december 2013 diagnosed.
176193658,I can’t relate because from age 11 I got mixed up with gang violence and drugs. When I got drug-induced psychosis at 17 that ended all of that. Got Dx’d with SZ at 23. To be honest my life is so much better now post-diagnosis than it ever was before. I hate who I was before psychosis came along. This is actually an improvement.
176193659,That’s admirable. I’m nice to those people so I don’t wind up in trouble.
176193660,When was the last time you were in hospital? I was worried about a relapse for the first 2 years after my last hospitalization.
176193661,ok. Wouldn’t you run if you could?

176193663,"It’s still the morning, but it has been nice so far, so I already have three positives. I had another wasp visitor in my room. I see them often. I like arthropods, so it makes me happy to see them. They’re very cute. Like I always do, I cupped him and put him outside, so he can go back to his nest. I like to imagine he tells his friends all about this weird, giant, scary monster who helped him return home Wasps aren’t bees, but bee kind to every kind, that’s something I believe in. I finally finished my Eevee collection in Shield! I evolved my Eevee into my last missing Eeveelution, _USER_ID_. My mother (who is currently in another country) sent me a video of these funky animals called pizotes! She was feeding them. They’re super cute and the video made me happy."
176193664,Call him again and tell him that. This is serious.
176193665,i felt scared and confused… being hunted the whole time and everybody was in on it. Didn’t have a second rest really.
176193666,I can understand your pain as well. Mine never call by my name. They only say she and it really makes me want to break down at times. But i know i can’t at times. As well as some facters i been binding and packing and thats when i feel most comfortable wuth myself. As welm as dressing in mens cloths. But i do still like wemons cloths like skirts and dress. Though when i was a child i used to wear them. I’d start to cry cuz i didn’t like how they made me feel at all. All we can do is stay strong and we both can get through this.
176193667,I also want to move from my home town. One of biggest mistake in my life was to meet a girl. In 10 days after that I felt paranoid and my love feeling mixed up with my schizophernia genetic problems. It caused great pains.
176193668,I think it’s my ability to be a dork in pretty much any situation.
176193669,"I agree with that…i feel very sorry for having hurt the people i love in psychosis and through stupid choices and behaviour. I hate how they suffered because of me and it makes me feel deeply ashamed. It is something i kind of avoided because i felt so bad about it. Also others (psychiatrists etc) tend to say “ohhh…you couldnt help it, you werent yourself”. I think i disagree with that. I should have prevented it and taken more responsibility. Im working through/on it a lot at the moment. I think part of my hurt was because i genuinely couldnt remember and thought i never said it, and felt very ashamed when he told me."
176193670,How hard is it to just stick to the rules of the forum.
176193671,"Thanks, _NAME_. I’m good now. Getting ready to take my dog out she is staring at me begging because I started a YouTube binge. Work is in 1.5 hours and I feel I will be fine. I took a fish oil capsule last night which I realize actually intoxicates me which exasperates my anxieties. I will not be taking any more vitamins and hopefully I can get a few hours decent sleep later. WIsh I didn’t have to go to work but it’s a good thing. Doggy is staring daggers. I’ll be back later. Thank you everybody"

174392031,I’m not sure this is the cognitive impairment from antipsychotics or the negative symptoms of Sz. I’m struggling with poor memory and short attention span.
176193673,Do you have depression?
176193674,"Yeah, I don’t like him for sure. that’s why I often refer to him as Y donor. That entire side of the family has done absolutely nothing for me. Tbh I don’t know his face. I mean all that literally. No responsibility."
176193675,"Thanks, what did your friend say to you that made you feel bad, you dont have to say it if you dont want to, i understand."
176193676,But I bounced back quickly and then I left. Im learning great methods to getting over him.
176193677,Thanks! Happy to hear you passed!
176193678,"I’m working on relaxing and, of course, meds help."
176193679,I wish I exercised way more when younger. I’ve been doing the sz thing since 1999 and I was 29 when diagnosed. It’s one of those chicken or the egg moments. I spent a lot of time existing which is fine. You can do it on the meds and I think I’m in that transition phase anyways. I’m soon to be 49. Positives are way low and leading a rich and realized life is good for me. I’ve no complaints. Still. I would say to everyone to increase exercise and don’t load up on things like nicotine. Healthy choice is the way to go. That is my silver lining at 48and 11 months.
176193680,I hope you are right _AT_MENTION_.
176193681,And it’s not just the pink paper or the sparkles imbedded onto the page!! But I’m proud of my resume. Just printed it out. Wish I could show u guys. But waaaay too much personal information on it.
176193682,"thought blocking o yes that is it. i forget the term, it used to happen to me when i was unmedicated more frequently. but i experienced it again last night and my mind just went blank for a couple minutes, and i couldn’t remember what i was thinking about."
176193683,"of course not , once the excess secretion os over , i think the illness are over, also who knows what would happen when the dopamine keep staying in our brain when the receptor is blocked? more recetoprs are created? and that’s what cause a over-sensivity of dopamine when the Aps is withdrawn because more receptors are created trying to balance out the effectcfrom the APs"
174392036,Yeah it wasn’t good for me either. Was getting major sensory overload and getting anxiety attacks from city noise. Then things were looking like I was in some video game
174392034,You can’t just reverse schizophrenia without meds.
176193684,What size pan is that?
176193685,"No worries, it’s in the past."
176193686,Just in case you need a reminder of how suicidal you were last time you quit meds _AT_MENTION_
174392032,I never heard voices but I’m on abilify. Beware of abilify 5mg. 10mg is the minimum dose for schizophrenia. 5mg works as an antipsychotic for about 5 weeks then poops out. That’s what the clinical trials say. So don’t be fooled into thinking it would continue working long term at that dose. But meds are all personal trial and error so I hope it works out for you. Also it takes 2 weeks for abilify to reach a steady state in your body. It actually took months for abilify to bring my psychosis under control the first time. But I was really acute. Best of luck with it _AT_MENTION_

176193688,"I feel that people can get furious at any moment. Actually, I feel that something bad can suddenly happen at any moment I feel safe that involves people being angry."
176193689,It was stupid to risk my neck because I didn’t say “No”.
174392039,"I get myself out of a funk by doing something I love like listening to good music, or watching something funny on tv. I feel like schizophrenia thrives when it can control your mind. Or when you have no choice but to listen to the voices. (I just posted New York by _NAME_. Everybody should listen to that song at least once.) When your focused on something you love it can’t do that. I watched a couple episodes of _NAME_, and maybe _NAME_ one day and it totally helped. I also meditate (there’s tons of YouTube videos on it) or read my bible. It’s helped me so much."
176193690,Maybe time to trade up for better friends?!?
176193691,I need to know what _NAME_ will “guarantee” that I will sleep?
176193692,"Part of me thinks if I moved away they wouldn’t be able to send me to North Korea. My rational mind tells me that there’s a possibility that they could still get me. But part of my gut feeling tells me what if I just moved away? Do you think I’ll go to hell for allowing myself to be taken away to North Korea by not killing myself first or at least not moving away? But part of me thinks that my boyfriend can protect me here too but I guess it doesn’t feel as strong as my gut feeling. But if I’m psychotic I can’t trust my gut feeling, so I take that into account. Overall, I feel guilty because maybe the reason I feel psychotic because I feel like I faked it before. So I’ll be guilty in the end. But then I see a lot of people feel that way here. So I feel stuck in the end. Almost like karma is biting me."

176193698,can you have both schizophrenia and autism?
176193699,Ok but you dont see him which is good. Perhaps all you need is a med change what meds are you on.
176193700,"If you have, has it helped? I want to ask my doctor for it as its suppose to help negative symptoms.It works on glutamate. Im currently on abilify but abilify doesn’t help my negative symptoms. Only wellbutrin seems to improve my negative symptoms."

176193706,"Solipsism, Cartesian Theater, Brain-in-a-Vat To amend them it wouldn’t be just you or I - you would also have at least one antagonist hosting the show and I’m pretty sure a few other subjects; no one would waste this effort on just one person. Now as for Solipisism referring to ‘no one outside of us’ because we might be god and all of this ‘a prop to occupy our time’ (see: Breakfast of Champions or Zero Theorem ) I wouldn’t buy into that either - it was the last head shrink used by the _PERSON_ in attempts to turn Number 2 in _PERSON_’s ‘The Prisoner’ series and it does seem like a sure-fire way to assimilate and synchronize a large group of people to one other person’s will ( ie; Nazi soliders )"
176193707,Lol - dont worry about it.
176193708,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , I am so sorry…losing someone is so incredibly tough. I personally lost several friends to various conditions. Please remember them in your thoughts- if their memory lives in you, that means that he still remembers you by. I am thinking of you."
174392046,I feel i would be at risk of losing my life i get into dangerous situations - run away with no shoes and got in a mans car smoking all night etc i get violent command (and i’m in the box called ‘complier’ to these) so id officially be at risk of prison and GBH or although I’m a woman i get very strange or abusive sex behaviours which could get me in trouble I could get hit by a car - my schizophrenic sister died like that although that makes me more aware of traffic my mum was hit by a car in front of me as well but this is another story It’s endless how i can get in trouble - if i drive - if i go drug seeking (not a current thing - just experimented as a teenager) but it’s there and it can get a bit sordid and dangerous I’m not really trying to tell my life story here - sorry i know it happened anyway these are ways a schizophrenic can get into life changing or ending situations
176193709,"I have extremely negative self-image. I can’t seem to get out of it. I just keep thinking that sz is embarrassing because the society perceives it so, and therefore I am embarrassing and disgusting. I think that no one will love me and everyone will hate me because I have two disabilities. Education doesn’t matter because I’m sz and it downplays all value… How do I get out of this mindset? It’s killing me and I just keep thinking about killing myself. My mom told me, “Do you want to die together with me?” because I just keep repeating my negative self-image. She told me to stop going to therapy because it won’t help and I won’t get myself out of it. I don’t know, I want to cry. Life is hard. And I just feel so alone. And I feel like a failure. Thanks for reading."
176193710,"She said they were all waiting for me to wake up. I woke up at 5 am and along with it came my awakening. I know for sure that two people I thought were friends don’t exist. And I realized my neighbours arent talking ???? about me or screaming cruel things through the walls at me. I walked around with my pants sagging, shoulders in a shrug, that went away too (yes I’m a big boy now, pants and all). Saw my pdoc today and he said I could go to the hospital tomorrow morning, via direct admission to sort out my meds to help me more with being able to detect what’s real and what’s not. He says that since I’m quite calm and my behaviour does not resemble someone in a full on crisis, I’ll possibly be able to make good, meaningful progress this time. I feel hope for the first time since my diagnosis."
174392056,"Hello everyone, I am new to this forum. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 and I am trying to figure out the cause of my symptoms. I have tactile and auditory sensations. I was told that it could either be caused by a build up of glutamate or because of a spill over of dopamine in the limbic system. I have been researching and evidence points to an issue with mechanotranduction and mechanosensing networks like PIEZO2. I have not been reading anything where dopamine or glutamate triggering touch, but where touch triggers dopamine. Also have been reading that specific g-coupled protein receptors can modulate mechanotranduction profoundly. I think it is cause by exposure to Magnetites because they can have a profound effect on magnetism of nerves and the brain which can effect mechanosensing and mechanotranduction, plus I have taken many meds and got little to no relief. Can someone help?"

The female voice is constantly second guessing what I do “you didnt lock your car, your windows are up, you left the stove on.” Its so intense I have to check my car and etc. At least twice an hour.

174392050,"I know next to nothing about Saphris. Once I was no longer depending on drugs, and they were out of my life, my life opened up. I had a part time job near the end of my addiction and soon after I was clean for a month or two I enrolled myself in community college. I soon made a friend and we hung out and went places on the bus. But I’ll fill in some details that flesh out the story. I smoked crack four years in the late 1980’s. I had been going sporadically to AA and NA for a year before I got clean for good. I was 29 when I got clean and living in a temporary residential treatment home where they had an AA meeting in the dining room every Tuesday night. That meeting was the start of my sobriety. Soon I moved into a board & care home. I had my job, I found more meetings and that’s where I was living when I enrolled in college. I won’t make this a long answer but the five years I lived in the home were my most productive years. Basically, I was employed the entire time, took two classes each 
semester the entire 5 years, I had the friend I mentioned, I went to AA, CA, and NA meetings 5 or 6 times a week and socialized with my family on most weekends. I should say here that I haven’t been to a meeting for a few years but I have no cravings for drugs. I hope you’ve heard the saying “Nature abhors a vacuum”. Basically it means that if there’s space in nature it will always be filled by either animals or people or vegetation. And once one species abandons an area, it will naturally be filled by other humans, animals or plants. It’s fluid and ever changing. And that’s why my life blossomed after I got off drugs. Once I had the absence of drugs and all the time, money, and negative things that goes along with doing drugs, basically all the areas of my life that were vacated by negative things, I filled them with positive things. Instead of spending all my time getting drugs, now I spent my time working. Instead of living in that negative haze of being drugged and tired, I was more clear-mi
nded (well, relatively. Remember, I have schizophrenia) and I started working out and doing sports at school. So when I got clean, my life snowballed and more opportunities opened up and I now did fun things. I have to say here that just because I was off drugs didn’t mean I was happy all the time. But I was sure happier more often. I still had symptoms and I still had problems and schizophrenia raised it’s ugly head many times and caused me distress and stressed me. It made things difficult. But I plowed through it and did my thing and I was so busy that it didn’t dominate my life. So to sum it up, they tell you to break a bad habit by starting good habits. Doing good habits will push the bad habits out. I had a drug habit which is a negative things but I started good habits like going to AA, CA and NA. I started hanging out with other positive, recovering addicts, I hung out in nice places where there were no drugs. And that’s how I got clean and this is how I stay clean."

176193796,"I started hearing voices a few months back or not. I challenged voices by making fun of their existance them like not giving in to their demands and cursing them. They strike back by threatening to kill me and my family. Keep in mind they say they have something on three of my family members and myself from hacking them and me. Other things: A guy stays outside talking about me for 18+ hours straight everyday talking about embarrassing things of my personal life. Gives away hacked passwords and tells people just passing by about what I do all day (stay at home in one room most of the day). They have microphones (hacked android) that can pick up a pin drop. They can see and hear what’s going on in my mind. I can hear my voice come from a spot in the upstairs hackers room electronically reverberating back to me. Situation: They say that I better get out of this room I’m in for the majority of most days or they will kill my brother(s) leak passwords or call the police to reveal hacked information 
about one or all of us. They say that I’m not supposed to eat food in their “house” because they have mics that they don’t want to turn off (I have intestinal gas not farts) that the mic can pick up even the sounds that are under 2 decibels. They talk bad about me “all” day even while I’m sleep and have nothing good to say. I’m constantly berated by the neighbors insults like: “you stink” (intestinal gas) “get a job” “you’re a fat a$$” ""small dic* “ugly” “bitc* a$$” “dumb a$$” “you’re stinking up the whole building” “???” They threatened to shoot me in the bathroom (they hate when I go to the bathroom). They follow me around everywhere including the bathroom (shower number 1&2) where they insult me and threaten me. They shared the hack with others so now I’m being spied on by others not just the “close” neighbors. They talk to me through the walls and never contacted me or my roommate directly with a note or a knock about the problems they have with u
s. They have hidden cameras all over the apartment which they sometimes deny but slip up other times. They only contact me and not my roommate through the walls. Does this sound like actual reality?"

176193818,"Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Oral administration of lumateperone caused systemic intracytoplasmic accumulation of pigmented material in dogs,rats, and mice at clinically relevant exposures (AUC). Intracytoplasmic pigmentation appeared to be localized in lysosomes. Accumulation of pigmented material persisted without reversal at the end of 1- to 2-month drug-free periods. Pigmented material was observed in the brain and spinal cord of all three species, and in the heart and eye of rats. Although the composition of the pigmented material was not established, the material is likely polymers or protein adducts formed from aniline metabolites of lumateperone.In the dog, accumulation of pigmented material in the brain and spinal cord was associated with neuronal degeneration and necrosis, followed by axonal degeneration and histiocytic inflammation after oral administration of lumateperone for up to 9 months. In the rat, accumulation of pigmented material was associated with degenerative changes 
and signs of an inflammatory response in the spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, eye, and heart after oral administration of lumateperone for up to 2 years. Although overt degenerative changes were not observed in the rat brain, the presence of pigment-containing infiltrating macrophages is consistent with an inflammatory response. The role of intracytoplasmic pigmented material in causing these lesions was not definitively established; however, the colocalization of pigmented material in tissues with degenerative changes and signs of inflammation is supportive. Alternatively, the aniline metabolites of lumateperone may undergo metabolic activation forming reactive metabolites that contribute to the observed toxicities. The role of intracellular accumulation of lumateperone or its non-aniline metabolites in these toxicities could not be ruled out. The aniline metabolites thought to be responsible for these toxicities were detected in dogs and rats but were not present in humans at quantifiable levels. Bas
ed on all the available evidence, these toxicities do not appear to be relevant to humans"

176193820,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

176193844,"The 1st one set the tone of my relationship with MH professionals for decades . Like you I was in very bad shape mentally . Prior to hospitalisation I had this idealistic idea of how psychiatrists were . After a week settling in on the admission ward I was told I was being sent to make doll’s houses . At the time I was incapable of doing the things I was usually good at ,let alone something I had zero aptitude for . I went into major panic mode, and had to be dragged from the path of a hospital bus . I then saw a pdoc who instead of doing the compassionate and intelligent thing ,i.e finding out what caused the reaction, very unsympathetically and angrily told me I was an awkward and troublesome teenager . I was then put on a medium stay ward . A suicide attempt on that ward , due to being distressed by that pdoc’s callous attitude , had me put on the closed ward . All through this I was on heavy doses of largactil and then mellaril with nothing for the side effects. Cue a horrendous case of aka
thisia . After 3 months there my mother and father got me transferred to a day centre near home ."

176193858,"I don’t think you understand the idea of “credibility”. The constant lying, deceitfulness, saying you’re faking, etc is gonna make people not wanna talk to you or help you. You can’t do these things, then wonder why you’re being ignored. You’re young, you’ll figure it out, but sometimes there are lessons to be learned."
176193860,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176193861,Just a lot of eastern European countries …
174392073,"I guess I’m not a doctor. But I know that is what _PERSON_’s previous doctor did, and she got fired for it. He was also at or over max of 3 other meds, too. He now sees a different doctor."
176193862,"Psych meds, especially AP’s have a lot of harsh side effects but I’ve learned over the years to accept the meds. I simply cannot function in society without them. I become a danger to myself and others without these psych meds."
176193863,i still do not know if i should listen to them. i want to do the right thing but i dunno wat it is

176193865,"Today was the 7 day mark of me being on Cipralex. My depression seems to be a tinyyy bit better. Key word , tiny, cause I swear these take 2-6 weeks to fully kick in. Am I imagining things or do I actually feel a benefit after 7 days. Is that even possible from a AD, so quickly?"
176193866,"It’s a little odd that he is doing pills and injection, I think talking about it is a good idea."
176193867,"I worked for over a year as an overnight security guard. I was on my own 90% of the time, and there was no real danger involved. Us guards were essentially just narcs, and if anything DID happen, we logged it and called the police (if necessary). I got great exercise walking all around, and took off 70 pounds in about 6 months. Another job I did (immediately prior to security) was as a bookkeeper. I processed the daily sales of stores and ran the numbers through an Excel spreadsheet. Easy-peasy. If the numbers didn’t match, I ran a report, and compared the two, found the discrepancy, and that was mostly it."
176193868,I hate it how my bf tells me that I’m too controlling and doesn’t know how to be with someone with aspbergers
176193869,"are you holding back out a general disgust over people who do so, share everything and don’t follow keeping everything to yourself?"
176193870,Even non mentally ill people have violent thoughts… Which is common in people. Not exclusive only to mental illness .
176193871,"yea no problem, thats skill you have, i wish i can draw like that i dont have capability, i suck lol. keep drawing your really good at it."
176193872,That stuff made me insane. I was bouncing off the walls and became instantly OCD on it. So glad I’m off that drug!
176193873,Not sure if I want the voice I can’t decide lol

176193876,"Is your awareness of surroundings reduced as years went by or is it constant? Mine worsened progressively. 10 years back intrusive thoughts were very severe, it not go from mind easily, always haunts whatever activity I do. But nowadays even though the initial obsession and compulsion urge is high it quickly vanishes away due to rapid forget. Thus those urges not able to become intrusive thought."
176193877,"Psychiatric Times Is There a Link Between Exercise, Cognition, and Schizophrenia Aerobic exercise has been found to exert a positive effect on global cognition and some, but not all, cognitive domains in patients with schizophrenia."
176193878,"Thanks for serving. My first delusion was “I wasn’t real”. And then “nothing was real” like I didn’t exist at all. Then I had “matrix delusion” and stuff. Had it since 2011, 10 years ago. Happened instantly from bad drugs (probably a bad batch or pot in college). Felt like some sort of trauma invovled directed towards me without getting into the details or being specific again. Thanks for sharing. Regarding the AI, it means you are sick but also inquisitive I think. I think I had some AI and alien involvement or hostility directed towards me. Makes me think _PERSON_ is right sometimes, that AI or aliens are directing the show and getting into our heads. It gets better with time and therapy. I am going back to therapy again after a few years absence. It’s hard to get good help. It took 6+ years to find a right AP that would work and keep me out of the hospital. At one point or another, I was going every 6 months. Now, it’s like once every few years."
176193879,Im sorry to hear brother. You should it can help a lot. But when you start on them again try to take it easy and rest. Same here I’m on olanzapine 20 mg
176193880,oh ok . i dont much about that stuff
176193881,That’s encouraging.
176193882,Thanks all of my valuable friends… I am very greatful to u all…!!
176193883,You might need a tutor at least. Nobody can self study themselves all the way through ninth grade. That’s a hard year.
176193884,No one in my family has sz except me. Other than depression and anxiety I’m the only one with mental illness.
176193885,That’s me too! Every day is the same for me too and I try to enjoy the little things Guess all we have is now so might as well make the most of it. Thanks.
176193886,Never seen an issue from you and please continue posting. We are successful as a website because we support each other and I and most people here don’t care where you come from if you follow the basic tenets of being civil and supportive. So sorry you feel threatened _AT_MENTION_ but your in safe hands here!
176193887,It feels like if I shut my eyes there going to pop out of my head. There twitching real bad wonder if anybody has any experience with that and what they did to stop it
174392072,this drugs touching nmda receptors?
176193888,We’re in this together!
176193889,The only thing that helped were benzodiazepines. Unfortunately I spent 5 years severely paranoid before I tried them. I tried them by accident. I was paranoid as hell one night and I was sitting up in bed and couldn’t sleep. I hadn’t slept in days. My wife tried shoving a Xanax in my mouth and I thought she was working for the government and I was going to fail a drug test but I was desperate and swallowed the Xanax. I calmed down and slept like a baby that night. The next day I went to urgent care to get a prescription for them. They would only give me 5 pills so I got in to see my PDoc and got a script. Been taking them ever since. I think they are a wonder drug and I am pissed that my psychiatrists never tried me on them before. My wife has social anxiety and takes .5 mg of Xanax 3 times a day. She can’t talk on the phone or leave the house without one. That was why she drank so much before she was medicated. I take only .25 mg once a day and it works fine for me.

176193891,"The goal of every psychiatrist is to assimilate and make people function normally in society. They police the patients so they are not a harm to themselves or others. It is as simple as that. In general society sees us as madmen/women and as dangerous due to the szs that commit serious cases of violence as reported by the media. Those szs who can pass off as eccentric may be able to get away with it and live a peaceful life, but they too will always be seen as outsiders by neurotypicals, and are they not? An inclusive dream of unmedicated szs being part of the general society isn’t really viable due to the abnormality of their ideas and actions. Zombify them, take away their spark and make them passive with strong aps and then the psychiatrists deem you fit to live a small life on the outskirts of society for many; while a few can thrive on aps. Just my two cents."
176193892,"Yes im grateful to have my phone at least. Thanks for all the advice! I might order a puzzle, book or a deck of cards online. They havent got a tv or puzzles or interesting books here. Id like to play boardgames too."
176193893,Why do you think I’m a psychopath?
176193894,sure what is it.

176193896,"Aside from your therapist seeming uncaring and unprofessional, your therapist also seems dishonest if she was billing insurance for time she wasn’t actually spending on therapy."
176193897,"yeah! You should. That would be all black and white and gray, right? I like some of that. Mainly in photos though."
176193898,"I’m sorry, _AT_MENTION_ , constant pain is hard to cope with. They say toothaches are one of the worst kinds of pain. I have pretty bad chronic pain, but toothaches are definitely worse. I’m sorry it’s lasted so long. Are you taking the codine on an empty stomach? If so, you could cause yourself more problems. Could you try crushing up and crackers and mixing it in with both and drinking it before you take your meds? Will help the stomach ache some of that’s what’s causing it. And, bonus, no chewing."
176193899,I’ve had my experiences with invisible people. I totally get that.

174392087,No infact I have lost most of my skills post-schizophrenia.

174392077,"Early on in my illness, before my medication, I was a full-blown catatonic schizophrenic. To me it was like not being able to speak, feel emotions, have no facial expressions, hardly move, and have a lack of thought. And this would be the case most of the day, especially in the afternoon. What helped me was a antidepressant, it didn’t fully cure it, but I regained some emotions back and thoughts back. Hope this helps, and I hope you get better."
174392083,Are you sure you didnt pick up the flu or something? It doesnt sound like something abilify would cause.

176193907,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 15
174392076,I made a thread about this but no one knew anything about it. Anyone knows or has studies about Vraylar’s efficacy vs other antipsychotics? Is it more or less effective than Abilify and Latuda? I still had positive symptoms on Latuda 80mg. Maybe I should try 120-160mg? My negative symptoms were better on Latuda. I think even better than on Abilify.
176193908,I suspect that being in the realms of taking the medications improves things somewhat for you and thus why your hospital stays you suffer less.
176193909,"With me, there was often an element of plausibility with my auditory hallucinations. It’s very plausible people might talk about me when I was in a restaurant, but I’d be the only person in the place."
176193910,"you are smart, i believe in you, you just need to find the right situation for yourself."
176193911,"Yes, I just googled it. I think I get one. They are very small."
176193912,That’s what I have read. I’m hoping as there was a lot of stress involved and a reduction in antidepressants maybe I can try again and also give up work. Probably not realistic then?
176193913,Alien tries to get me to kill my loved ones too. He puts images of axes and ropes and knives in my head to torment me. Sorry you’re struggling with it too. I know how horribly tormenting it can be!
176193914,Oh. Yeah. I still hear voices but I’m kinda used to them now

176193918,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . I think that exercising aerobically on an exercise machine is more professional than running outdoors. Even if your preferred activity is running, running on a treadmill is more professional than running outdoors, because on treadmills you can regulate speed and incline. And you can exercise in any weather conditions. Also, there are aerobic exercise machines like indoor rower and stepper(that I use) that are difficult to simulate in a “natural” environment."
176193919,I took antidepressants for a month 2 months ago and stopped them. Might be that or the antipsychotics.
176193920,Yes then its fine.
176193921,IDK. Molestation is a deal breaker in most cases. You must have a big heart.

174392084,"So here’s what I’m thinking of telling my doctor Monday…I feel it can’t wait any longer: I have depression, I am unable to feel happy normally. I thrill seek, have too much unhealthy energy, and feel disconnected from people and the world. My schizoaffective makes me sad, even depressed. I have mood swings, but usually feeling low lately. May I have an antidepressant prescribed? Do you think an antidepressant is right for people experiencing this or who have schizophrenia/schizoaffective?"
176193927,millions Minus Most of them
176193928,"I say its good to be careful with anything at all. A caffeine drink can make me psychotic or manic sometimes. Occasionally I take kratom, which isnt known to make you psychotic, but it does if I take more than 5-8 grams. It’s best to stay away from anything that made things worse as usually its not coincidence, just independent brain/ body chemistry."
176193929,People talk about moral implications when talking about masterbation for three days straight; they talk about their battles with morality and masterbation. So talking about morality development in a healthy way would help alleviate that dissonance. That’s just one example. You’re projecting being condescending with the article. The article is non biased and culturally appropriate.
176193930,"_AT_MENTION_ I understand you perfectly and you have all my understanding. In my opinion it is not enough not to have delusions and hallucinations or to be motivated. Certainly that is a starting point but it is necessary to have a full life so that the withdrawal of the antipsychotic does not cause the detachment that can be the trigger of the relapse. About 82% of patients fall back after a psychotic episode but this percentage can be reduced by positive predictive factors such as work, friends, relationships, family, sports, etc. Speak about it with your psichiatrist"

I stay out of relationships so that I don’t have to deal with the abandonment issues, but every single day I am constantly wondering whether people are criticizing or rejecting me in little conversations that shouldn’t matter. It makes me weary and I get to the point I don’t want to keep trying and working in therapy. That’s when I start getting self-destructive and begin sabotaging things."
176193941,"I set alarms too, I would go crazy without my meds pretty fast then after a while I get violent and suicidal."

176193949,"My advice is to try and seek someone in your life who you can talk to about this face to face. I went down this road a few months back when I had bad stress and anxiety from my job, and I ended up taking a load of my prescribed meds with red wine to end things. I ended up in the emergency room, and they did loads of tests before letting me see the duty pdoc I hope I am making clear from what I just said that you need to speak to someone you can trust to dispel these thoughts, and go past the barrier"

176193953,"With PTSD the way I finally started getting better is by putting the past down. It was too heavy to carry anymore so I put it down, but it’s hard to get to that point and a lot of work and healing goes on before you get there. As for the general emotional pain, stress, sadness and grief that you have just from being sz I know it’s hard. Anti-depressants definitely help, I don’t know what I would do without my Cymbalta. Well actually yes I do, I would lie in bed all day, withdraw from others almost completely, have changes in my appetite, be mentally tortured and suffer, think of killing myself and on and on it goes. My advice is to get a better anti-depressant and then start tackling the other issues if they are still issues once you feel better."
176193954,Did you ask your psychiatrist about it?
176193955,I am grateful that I am taking more showers and going on the treadmill a little. And that is how I show myself self love.
176193956,"So I’ve read the post on DMG vs sarcosine and will have to ask my doctor about it, so far I haven’t had the all clear to take either, so am just trying to motivate myself as best I can without. I didn’t read anything yesterday as I had quite a busy day seeing various people. The book on chakras is interesting and relevant to my meditation classes, but it’s not going to help me much with work. At the moment I just want to get into the habit of doing something everyday. I’d like to try volunteering again, last time I did that, I only managed about six months or less. I don’t actually have to do anything at the moment, which is what I keep telling myself to sooth my anxiety through acceptance. But as I said elsewhere, acceptance doesn’t mean condoning. I think I still care to much about being judged a success or failure. I also care about being a burden on others. Both of these things are good things to care about, but accepting reality is also important. Success and failure are relative 
as is being a burden on others. Even if we are supporting ourselves, we are usually consuming things that are produced through some form of exploitation, so our demands are in fact a burden. Perhaps burden is the wrong word, but my point is we are always dependent on other people in some way. I still think that minimising this and maximising success, are both ideals to aim for, but as someone once said, “ideals condemn” in that they can never be lived up to fully. You can see I’m quite confused. I think I just need to remember that this is a journey, there is no point where I will have reached 100% success or 100% independence. Finishing the book on chakras will be a success, so this is what I want to focus on for the time being. I want to continue reading at least five pages a day before 2pm, despite having missed one day yesterday. I haven’t been going to my mediation classes recently, which is what the book relates to, and reading the theory, I do wonder whether it is worth it. It is a very convolu
ted path to spirituality. I’ve studied many spiritual systems and Islam seems to me to be the most direct. The theory of chakras seems to be much more about developing ones abilities energetically and mentally which are not really necessary. One doesn’t need abilities to appreciate spirituality. If I enjoy it then there is no reason not to pursue it, so long as it doesn’t destabilize me, but it is also not very practical, at least with regards to making money. Still I want to finish the book at least, so will try and read another five pages today. Thank you."
176193957,"He may mean that he will always love you, but he is unhappy with your behavior at this time. I’ve never told my daughter I hate her and I never will, but I have had to tell her at times that while I love her, she’s currently disappointing me with poor behavior. Kids can do that when they push boundaries, make mistakes, and lie to you."
176193958,"Have any of you that tried Rexulti had really bad nightmares with it? Last night was my first night taking it and I was having nightmares all night long and way more visual hallucinations than normal. I assume they’re just sleep hallucinations, like hypnogogic out whatever they’re called. But still. Not looking forward to going to bed tonight for a repeat."

176193961,"Thanks for posting the article. I remember seeing that _NAME_ in the news. So sad that this persons simple idea of creating a space for lonely people has been highjacked in this way. I still don’t fully understand the incel mindset. I have managed to find peace being a bit of a hermit or loner, and I have learned to enjoy my own company. That applies to men and women in my case. If I have managed to find acceptance without the need to blame other people for not wanting to be friends with me, then I am sure others can too. I am fully culpable for my current position, and I am not afraid to deny it."
176193962,Lol that made me laugh. Thx for that.
176193963,_AT_MENTION_ Is the Loxapine not working? I was so hoping you’d get some relief!
176193964,yes speech impairment was one of my early problems
176193965,The rules are strict for a reason. We have people who are triggered by certain things. We strive to make a safe environment for all. And welcoming to all. No one else has a problem. If they get flagged they move on.
176193966,"Maybe. I think it’s normal for schizophrenia. I cannot do most things anymore. It started right after _PERSON_ for me. The meds take time to adjust. I don’t have dementia, but initially at 22 years old I thought I did. I had little insight or knowledge of what schizophrenia was. I never thought I would get it. Makes sense though. I have to deal with the hand I was dealt with. Schizophrenia for me is both a blessing but a major curse. I feel metaphysical stuff all the time like different dimensions and past lives. Like inter-dimensional stuff like time travel and reincarnation and esoteric stuff or knowledge. I know it is real because I go in and out of it. It’s a curse though. I rather be normal and stuff and have a life and not suffer. Seems to be a current thing in my lives to just always get schizophrenia. I happen to think aliens and stuff gave it to me because I did stuff like create things and revolutionized things and did a lot of innovation. Some big delusions I have had recently are 
I was a time traveler (it’s going away and getting better) because I have memories (I guess I worked on time travel and possibly built the machine) and I created bitcoin (no money, no proof of course-- just flashbacks); escaped the simulation/matrix and met the people or AI running our reality. Immortality stuff too like quantum AI and transhumanism like consciousness transfer into parallel timelines (worst ones) and mind uploading. But the truth is it wasn’t worth it because I suffer. I can’t do basic tasks that most people or even most schizophrenics can do and take for granted…like brushing teeth; showering; and even changing clothes. I lost all memories, experiences, and abilities. I was a top (one of the best) community college students and then lost it all and ended up being a freak show. Truth is I don’t even know how to program and do things and I struggle with motivation and basic math or grit and determinism and goals. I lost the ability to recognize objects and things in my environment. M
y listening skills are messed up and sound like nonsense and I lost the ability to read for years. I have improved. My body image issues I always had got worse because I gained so much weight so quickly. I had really bad DP/DR and 2 dimensional vision that looked and felt (physical feeling too) of a low resolution, crappy video game from the early 2000s. When I dream, I get to go to other realities for a bit and remember my past lives and get information and knowledge. But mostly it’s me living in fear and afraid for my wellbeing and life and my loved ones. I have fears and memories of being tortured in my past lives and I guess I remember it from my schizophrenia and nightmares. How is this possible? I then live through it during the day and I become delusional, I guess. I suffer a lot. But it’s just schizophrenia. I feel and know I died over a million times and came back alive. I even was targeted by extraterrestrials too in my past lives. No proof or evidence of course. It’s all in my head. I am a Ch
ristian because of my situations and circumstance but I think it’s based on trauma, fear, extraterrestrials, and stuff but I would like to think for myself some day and choose it based on free will and not fear of hell (other timelines) and fear of aliens hurting me again or having tragedy befall me again."

174392102,"In the US there is 3.5% unemployment and not too long ago they were talking about having more jobs than people applying for them. So as you may not be surprised to hear that there has been an effort to employ people from prison and yes the mentally ill. There’s now talk however that the economy is slowing and a recession may be near. However for the time being austerity measures are in progress like block grants for Medicaid, and work requirements as well. Naturally these jobs are the less desirable jobs in general and I expect that if the recession occurs they will go back to some of those who lose better ones and the mentally ill will be back where they started and the ex-cons will end up back in jail with the exception of those who perform well. It’s a part of life."

You can follow some tips: No artificial sweetners; Prefer eating whole foods; Less processed foods; Less sugar; Less fats; Eat fruits and vegetables. Drink at least 2 litres of water a day; Organic foods when possible.

Thanks for accepting my compliments that day/because in the real world I’ve been called a “flatterer” and someone who “tries too hard”. BUT a lot of women could take a page out of your book and absorb more candor sometimes without going directly to the ‘creep’ word. A lot of times men blurt out flattery prematurely bc they can’t think on their feet. My secret is a weight and (an obstacle) in that regard. But women look for this trait because it equates to success. I’ve enjoyed mixing it up with you a lot, and with my ramble style you chose to make me feel like it was a happy accident… and I like that bc it makes me feel like I’m really intelligent when I might need to, or can actually benefit from that. I’m trying to feel like less of a fraudulent guy though(a lot of people have that complex). The levels of the mind assist 
people in lying to themselves. I meant it about Karate _NAME_ from that “scary” movie, maybe I just like spiky hair.

However, the listing says that only about 10% of people experience significant side effects. Is this a case of a vocal minority that is always complaining about their side effects? Or, do the disclosures downplay the percentage of people who experience these problems? I will be starting antipsychotics pretty soon, and the medications seem almost as scary as the disease."

174392118,"Here in Us I get 804 a month after 156.50 taken for Medicare. I got put on disability before I turned 30 for 9 psychiatric and chronic pain disorders. Because I had not worked for 10 years, my payments equal to about $3.75 an hour I don’t make minimum wage, my husband makes 20.48 an hour as a prison sgt, but we still are using food pantries to supplement because we are 200 dollars over the limit of 5 people for food share and Medicaid. We make 52k a year total, but even with minimal Bill’s, my medical bills. His insurance premiums to cover me for rx coverage and secondary, plus having 3 teenagers we just can’t pull ahead. I am currently drug resistant schizophrenic as main cause, bbn I have failed or had an allergic reaction to everything out there. I am only on xanax for anxiety until we can get me into a drug trial program, but most won’t take me because of my other health problems. I haven’t slept in 4 days, they’re gonna up my xanax every week until I’m on 10mg a day, I’m at 1.5 
a day now. But we’re in a battle with the health system because when I had my last allergic reaction to vraylar on august 7, I went to er because my panic attack was so severe I threw up for 6 hours straight, had such violent shaking and other things they treated me as a drug user and accused me of withdrawing from hardcore street drugs. When the blood tests came back clean, as in not even tylenol in my system, they gave me a hip injection while I was sitting, and injected mlm it into the cartridge and blew out my hip joint. So now I can’t walk. I had xrays and my regular doc said I am either gonna have a hip replacement or will be fitted into a hard hipbrace for 6 months, either way, it’s the ER’s fault. I see avsoecialist on Oct 1st, to determine which ig will be, but nobody will give me pain meds because of WI’snopiod crisis in our county where we’ve had 40 deaths this year alone. S o I suffer. But they put me kn complete bedrest until I see the specialist. So hubby is essentially my caretaker, 
only provider working 8-16 hour mandated days because of the prison shortage, and he has to DC o all the kids stuff. I feel useless, and I saw my pdoc yesterday, she is at a loss as to what to do. So we up the xanax, hope I pass out every few days, and meanwhile I told her I just want to die. I am 34, married 16 years,together with my husband since 15 in 2000. Our kids are 15, 14, and almost 13. Sometimes i wonder If the life insurance the prison took out on me would be worth more to my family than me being useless like I am. I won’t go back to a psych ward after being sexually assaulted in one in 2008 I SD, I told my docs they will find me dead first. So they don’t even suggest it ever.

I have improved mental state and starting to feel better. I started taking it because it can help lower blood pressure a little and schizo often die of heart disease so we need it bad. Was not expecting it to help my brain so much. I found online that the American psychiatric association now recommend that patients take it for almost any mental illness. Funny how I’ve seen several psychatrists for 10 years now and not one ever mentioned fish oil. I feel like I’ve really been robbed not knowing about how good fish oil is for so long.

By the way, your clear and present hatred of religion, just means you would rather think of us nodes in collective, not actual beings, but subject to what ever TCP\IP\UDP constructs you would constrain our communication toward and away from communication. I wonder if you understand argument really, its not the sophist asserting a position, communication is the asset that bridges even so called “holy” and “right thinking” divides."

176194081,I took this combo for many years when I was a kid (12-16) for insomnia and Oppositional Behavioral Disorder I guess. I was a minor so I really don’t know all the details they would only tell my mom. I was on a bunch of stuff before that but that’s the the combo that stuck. It knocked me ouuuut when I took it at night. It would always be a very rough time getting up it was a weird kind of semi deep sleep. I randomly googled the combo and I was intrigued when I stumbled across this.
176194082,Not sure if I had absence seizure or what but it was terrifying

176194084,It’s strange I took mdma with alcohol once but didn’t experience psychosis til about 3 months later starting with delusions. I wonder whether they were connected somewhat. I’m sorry to hear about your experience with the bad trip Wave.

176194088,"Are you having bad side effects? If you are then I would recommend trying to taper down and see if that helps. Explain to your doctor that is why you want to wean down. If you are not having any bad side effects i see no reason to taper down. If it aint broke dont fix it. Your stability isn’t worth risking for some ideal of being on less meds or no meds. This is like saying “Well the new tire i put on my car has been letting me drive well for 2 years now, I think its time to take a tire off just to see how I do”. Maybe the reason why you’ve been stable for 2 years now is because you finally found the perfect dose for you?"
174392122,I think that is a pretty awful thing to ask someone with schizophrenia.
176194089,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I have been trying to get a doctors appointment but my old pdoc retired in October, and his replacement leaves this month who I never got to see. I have to wait until the end of this month for the new doctors to start so they can assign me to someone and book an appointment. It’s really frustrating. I was supposed to have follow up 8 weeks after I started Sertraline in October"

176194091,Wow. That’s great to hear.
174392121,I was saying I never heard that Clozapine stops TD. I didn’t discuss it with my dr. I read about extrapyrimidal symptoms vs TD. _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ was the one who was told Clozapine stops TD.
176194092,I hope you get it
176194093,I remember going into the ER for a cyst in my ovary. Holy crap it hurt so bad. They put me on morphine and I swear it made me feel like they were putting me to sleep. I cried out… “They’re killing me! They’re killing me!”

176194096,"I went to Cuba in 1998, flying Cubana, to study Spanish. I also wanted to take piano lessons but ended up studying percussion with a Santeria priest. Just before I left, he asked me to participate in a session(?) with his wife and a man from the street, playing clave. I remember sitting to his right, at one point, the man from the street shaking his head, and then sitting to his left as his wife gasped. After I returned I had my breakdown about a year later. There are many reasons for my condition, indeed, in some ways I appeared in this world with it, but I still obsess about this particular event and Cuba in general"
176194097,It’s been recommended by a good doctor to my father. It’s backed by some decent science and good for the liver.
176194098,I’m sorry the experience triggered you… I have experience in homeless shelter also in Seattle and I’m sure I freaked many people also… I was in midst of psychosis and rambling religious nonsense and sometimes grotesque remarks?

174392132,"Imo, love is just an idea."
176194102,"I’ve been to a couple of bad ones but not as bad as that I don’t think. One I went to didn’t have group, or therapists and the pdoc was some weirdo who didn’t seem to know what he was doing at all. All I could do was lie in bed and wish I was dead and try not to kill people who were making noise until they let me go home. One place was giving me so much ativan I was blacking out and took 2 doses of milk of magnesia because I couldn’t remember taking it and ended up crapping myself. One place kept letting this girl steal my things until I had enough and took matters into my own hands and confronted her and got my stuff and put an end to it. One place put me on a sodium restricted diet and the food was terrible which doesn’t sound that bad but food is a coping tool for me so it was horrible to have to eat this bland, lifeless food for 7 days. In one of the hospitals the shower could be seen from the hallway and had gaps in the curtain, you had to leave your door open even when you showere
d. I didn’t shower when I was there because of this."
174392135,That’s interesting. My sister has/had scoliosis and had to have corrective surgery. She also has schizophrenia.
176194103,"To me, it seems like you just traded one crappy situation for another, but only you can decide which one was worse for you. Either way, just because something is less bad, doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s good. Your delusions may be destroying you more slowly or differently that the abuse you suffered did, but they’re still destroying you. I don’t want that for you. It would be the greatest of tragedies."

176194106,"Depersonalisation. I think if I had to guess, this is very common and actually Wikipedia says it is in the top three most common mental health symptoms along with depression and anxiety. I really truly do not like this symptom because it suffocates my feeling of wellbeing. IMO it goes hand in hand with anxiety and in the long term leads to depression. if it is severe and chronic enough oh sorry, it is a ‘symptom’, not a ‘disorder’"
176194108,"It’s a hallucination and possibly a delusion (if you believe if). You’re not going to hell, a lot of people hear that. It’s just noise. I don’t believe in hell personally. If two wrongs don’t make a right, then whatever number of wrongs you did and then eternal infinite wrongs also don’t make a right… if that makes any sense."
176194109,I just wanted to ask if you have gotten a worse cognition while treated with seroquel. Because I have. At the moment I have suggested to my nurse that we raised the dose of Clopixol to 500 mg. every 3 week and lower the seroquel dose to 300 mg. Seroquel from 600 mg and we keep geodon at 160 mg

176194125,Well I’ll be around in 10 years so this doesn’t help me.
174392137,Fish oil didn’t work out for me at all. It just made me really anxious. Maybe it interacted with abilify?
176194126,I had odd experiences also.
176194127,It blows my mind that she thinks anyone would want to plagiarize her stuff in the first place. I’ve seen better work from grade schoolers.
176194128,"_AT_MENTION_ that’s the thing, no I haven’t. I’ve been like this as long as I remember. I’ve been in and out of therapy for it since I was roughly 12. Yes, it is a rough break up. I am almost 32, however. I am not 16. I have had several rough break ups in my life. I am searching for answers to the root of the issue though. Which always seems to be this lack of self love."
176194129,"I had a huge editorial paper on election today that I needed to translate. I didn’t know that translation was so hard! The prof gave 5 students F and C to two people. He said he’s being hard on us because it’s our first assignment, but I think I’m getting better at translating. I finally got the translation done 30 minutes ago, and now I’m just fixing some words. I asked my dad for some help and he had a lot of criticism for me. He said I did a great job, however, but it kinda felt like he was telling me that I was a failure. I started to feel like I needed to punish myself by hitting myself on the wall because I made mistakes. I don’t know why I do this- I don’t know why I get urges to hurt myself when I make mistakes. I always tell myself that mistakes are bad, and it’s a horrible thing to make mistakes. When you make mistakes, you must hurt yourself and hate yourself until you improve. I used to hurt myself when I got a bad grade at uni but I was able to hold myself together and 
not harm myself. My mom told me that everyone makes mistakes, and that it’s ok to make mistakes because you’re learning. She said no one is good at something on their first few tries, and it may take years to perfect a skill. But I couldn’t accept her words because I felt like I should be perfect. I’m trying not to harm myself or write hateful words on my diary about myself but I’ll be ok. I’m really excited to receive my next translation assignment. Plus, I get to read different editorial articles about all kinds of things. My prof said that he’ll mostly focus on newspaper articles and current events. Also, I told my assistant professor of the department that I will be specializing in translation and interpretation, and not just translation. He said, “Ok, so be it.” My assistant professor called again on the next day to confirm. So everything seems to be in place in terms of concentration and I’m really grateful for my professors for being so kind, especially for my assistant professor fo
r explaining EVERY SINGLE CONCENTRATION available in the department. Thanks everyone for being so supportive, even in my darkest times."
176194130,"Sounds like the wellbutrin did it. Early on I was on heavy meds and was less functioning. Latuda was good, but got weak, I was on 180+ mg of Latuda + risperdal. I notice the improvement in IQ and stuff with Latuda before and now. It’s all situational with a lot of factors. I can only take cymbalta for AD. Rest give me psychosis or whatever. I also felt like Latuda didn’t work for the longest time but now it does. You gotta take it with food and stuff and I felt like aliens were targeting me back in 2015/2016 or something and the meds just didn’t work at all back then…now they do."

176194138,"At work it kind of plays second fiddle to getting the job done and dealing with people. I work on my own at work and have many moments where I feel calm and have peace of mind and my mind stops racing. It started about two years ago, it is something I craved for years.

It’s worse than any of my other delusions. I try to rationalize it by saying it’s isomorphic to one meaning it shares all the same properties of an artificial reality, but isn’t one. In 2011 when I had drug induced psychosis, God was talking to me in my NDE, and told me I’m stuck in the matrix. Now, years later, I have memories of being outside the simulation and running it. I’m trapped here as a schizophrenic in a time loop for eternity. That’s my delusion anyways. It causes so much fear and anxiety. I don’t think any amount of medication or therapy will help it. Deep down inside, I think it’s partially true. I google it constantly, and it makes sense scientifically. That and I think you can have an artifical reality WITHIN a real universe.

176194190,Sounds like paranoia to me though. 99.999% of people wouldnt do that and it is pretty illegal. If they were doing something illegal the last thing they would do is talk to the neighbours about it.

176194201,"_PERSON_ was 4 or 5 when they tested him for autism spectrum, they said it really seemed liked he fit the requirements, but tests showed otherwise. Now, he did go into kindergarten what they called an “early 5” as his bday is June 29, school began Aug 18th or something, so he was technically the youngest 5 in the class. He did have to repeat, but they had an IEP made for him before school started even without the autism diagnosis. He had fine motor issues, like even now at 14 he has trouble writing, so since 3rd grade in this district he types all his assignments, plus he gets extra time on tests, etc. He’s now on a 504 plan, which is an IEP without special education classifications, and he’ll start high school next year. He’s gotten all A’s and B’s this year, which for him, is amazing. So he wasn’t on spectrum, but they knew he had other needs so that test showed us those. But that’s from a parent with a kid, I don’t know if anything will change as an adult with a diagnosis. Th

I encourage you to start a crystal help thread like before. You got a lot of responses before with that. You might have better success than having them all locked as spamming. It’s just a suggestion if you are upset they are being locked."

174392182,yeah I’ve become a bit obsessive after being on clozapine for such a long time
176194247,Maybe you’re not reading faces and voices so you’re reacting off? Being too literal? Perhaps?
176194248,"I’m telling you guys, after all of the time I have spent on here, and the dozens of people talking about their delusions, not once did someone listen to someone giving them advice. Hes not going to listen to you."

176194251,I would like to know what solutions you guys use to consistently take your meds regularly without forgetting and without double dosing.
176194252,Trazodone is a sleeping med. It’s really strong. I used to only take about 50mg and it would knock me out for hours. I have some left over from when I used to take it

176194255,"If you can afford to shop around you might find a therapist that works well with you. Psychologists are not God. They cannot understand everyone. There are more certain types a psychologist might help, and another psychologist might understand and help another type. For a long time I thought I would do better with a female pdoc than a male pdoc because I fear intimacy with a man. Women have their hazards for me too, though. It all takes money, though. If you don’t have money you have to take what you can get."

176194262,Welcome to the forum! I also have paranoid schizophrenia.
176194263,Seems to me that most therapists are a bunch of money grubbing narcissists interested in only their self interests. It’s like this for like a HUGE chunk of people in general in my opinion. I just try and keep track of the few people who aren’t users and opportunists. In the meantime we can all be therapists for each other.

176194266,"If I didn’t read so many people wrong I would be the nicest guy around. I just feel threatened sometimes. The checkout girl at the pharmacy was looking at me. In a split second I judged her and thought she was trying to get something from me. I got defensive but then realized my mistake and I was more friendly and even though I had forgot my coupon for what I came for, we ended the conversation on a high note and I walked away smiling and she was smiling. Whew! That was a close one!"
176194267,But i don’t need the shots they kill my brain
176194268,"I didn’t have a specific reason for leaving actually. I was just doing well psychosis-wise and not doing well at all eating disorder-wise. I didn’t have any questions or art to share, so I really had no reason for being on here.

176194271,What kind of difference?
176194272,"Hopefully you won’t relapse, take care and you’re welcome back at any time."
176194273,"Wow, I think it’s a perfect diet except the fact you could eat more. Low carbs, enough amount of protein and fat(cheese). And 1 hour of exercise is great! Even, you didn’t eat milk, which is bad for health, but soy bean milk. I’m sure you probably would get something achieved!"
176194274,i have a social worker to go to but there’s a problem i need to seek advise on and maybe someone here has ideas. she is kind and helpful insightful and smart. however whenever i complain about other people being nasty i.e. at work or in the community she says i am delusional and it isn’t real. i believe it is as real as daylight. what should i do? this aspect of treatment is the opposite of supportive but i need the other aspects that she provides. any advise? _NAME_
176194275,I am glad the AD works for you. Always happy to hear someone doing great.
176194276,That advice seems good to me.

176194280,"I believe you, I will retry therapy one day. I only tried once and it was too stressful, it was an occupational therapist. What type of therapist did help you? A psychologist? I feel like I need to improve myself a bit before retrying therapy. Hopefully one day it will help."
176194281,It sounds great. I think you should give it a go. Understanding of yourself but encouraging and supportive and pep talk to go. They don’t seem to have that type of thing where I live. There are was a activity house for mentally ill in Sweden that I used to go to when I lived there and it was such a great place.
176194282,Why what does it sound like??
176194283,Motivational / mental health memes online sometimes keep me going
176194284,"The reason is you believe in every impulse, urge, thought, feeling etc even if its true or false. Then another factor is habit. When you wash hands for some dirt or some other you are compelled to repeat every time when faced with that dirt. This then become a habit or automatic response. So now two things one due to believing and other due to habit."
176194285,I cancelled my appointment I just felt that I couldn’t risk losing all my benefits on an attempt at employment

176194288,It won’t shrink out of existence and I reckon even with 4 in on these meds if your going longer your in the game. It’s not your manhood. People have smaller size and still satisfy their partners. It’s not a deal breaker your making it.
174392175,Nobody is ever 100% sure with anything…
176194289,I think it’s a good idea. I would call your counselors secretary. You’ll be fine _AT_MENTION_ . Don’t panic.
176194290,"Well it’s worth trying, you know."

176194292,"Yeah, it is a never ending torture, to be honest. But with medicine and therapy they can subside, but not leave. You can’t ever stop thinking as long as you have a brain, but over time and with support you grow to accept these images. It is hard but you got this."
176194293,I highly disagree Anybody can follow a spiritual path No matter mentally ill or not And meditation and kundalini helps tremendously for anxiety and depression for anybody!
176194294,"First step is recovery. Until you are really stable, nothing else matters. IMO if you really want a stable relationship, trial an error is the way to go. This was an error, keep learning from your mistakes. Your experience will be invaluable for future relationships."
176194295,Peace. It’s a sensitive topic but it’s worthwhile discussing triggers sometimes. No need to fight or such. I’d agree it’s not my cup of tea but keep it civil and supportive. Locking threads don’t help a conversation. All’s I’m saying is a so called normal person confided in me some pretty dark stuff so these thoughts might not be common but out there…

176194297,"Because there is no statistical relationship between smokers and SZ. Smokers get SZ at the same % as non-smokers. If smoking was really causing SZ like weed, the government would put a warning on cigarettes boxes about SZ like weed. Here in Quebec weed (Marijuana) is legal and on the box it says “Weed can cause and worsen schizpohrenia”. I would have posted a picture here but I stopped smoking weed last year."

176194304,Both you and _AT_MENTION_ need to know the situation I came from. My mother kept the house spotless - you could eat off the floor. But we kids suffered from neglect. I know from experience that I’d rather live in filth and to have a chance to realize that people are more important than a mess than to try to have the ways of my Mom.
176194305,They think I’m a spy for another country. They’re Navy SEALs
176194306,Feels good doesn’t it. I’m happy for you.What kinds of predictions about the future? And what kinds of things did you have to do for them?
176194307,"Are you familiar with the term “derealization” at all? It is when the world around you seems distorted in an unrealistic way. Do you think this is what you are describing? It is an overlap of psychosis and anxiety, and it is common in trauma survivors. Grounding exercises can help. Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate s
omething with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers."

176194310,"What do you mean _AT_MENTION_? Are you referring to a kind of light duty, brief (few minutes to a few hours) kind of quasi relapse? Where you feel dazed, kind of groggy and not really processing your sense of reality very well for a while? If so, I get those sometimes. Stress, lack of sleep, not taking my meds are regular times or bad lifestyle habits seem to trigger it."
176194311,Are you the guy that doesn’t know or are you one of the ones that knows about the guy?
174392191,This whole idea that people are “extras” in your life is pretty narcisisstic. It’s just random people doing their own thing. Earth is a big place. Only reason you feel like the center of attention is your partially treated schizophrenia.
176194312,I couldn’t read it all. But I have many experiences with crazy coincidences
176194313,"So these are a total disaster, but I thought I would post them anyways. It was my very first attempt at working with chocolate, aside from candy melts. The chocolate wasn’t tempered properly, so it turned a bit chalky and speckled instead of solid dark. They taste good, though. The inside is a cinnamon cardamom ganache.

174392183,"Welcome back! I haven’t tried Clozapine because I feel okay on what I take now and I’m fearful of another bad reaction like I’ve had with some APs in the past. I hope it works out well for you though, it’s the next option for me if I ever choose to take it. My psychiatrist thinks it could be effective for my voices, which haven’t been successfully silenced by any medicine yet."
176194316,That’s good news. 300mg is a big dose. I think you are lucky.
176194317,they are not proffesionals on your cleverness

176194324,"Gods, don’t follow any fad diet. Just don’t. You see a popular diet offered as advice, run the other way. The only thing that actually helps with weight is using more calories than you take in. Carb restrictions help short term, but when you add carbs back your weight balloons and it throws off your blood glucose. Complex carbs from vegetables are the best carbs and needed for health. Refined, processed carbs are not. You can restrict refined and processed carbs and see a big change, but again, you are using calories more than the empty ones taken in with that restriction. I lose weight with portion control and exercise. I walk, weather permitting. So it isn’t major exercise. And I lose 40+ pounds doing that. My portion control is eating whatever I want as long and the portions are the size of the front of my fist. So in a regular meal I had 3 things that size to eat. Added up to enough to sate my hunger but not stretch my stomach organ."

176194362,"Depression: I treat myself like I would treat a depressed friend. Put on some music I like, treat myself to good food, make sure I’m comfortable and that I have something I enjoy to watch or do. Anxiety: I find breathing in squares to help when I’m having an anxiety attack. What I do is, I find a sqare to look at. Computer screen, door frame, mirror, doesn’t matter. Then I slowly let my eyes wander across one side while I inhale, another side while I hold my breath, the third side while I exhale, and the last side while I hold my breath. It keeps me so focused on the breathing I forget to have anxiety, and the deep breaths help calm my body down. Psychosis: I make sure there’s as little external stimuli as possible. I stay away from noise and strangers, but make sure I have someone online to talk to should I need it. Sometimes I even shut off the lights and just listen to music. I find music really helps."

176194394,"Hello everyone I want to give insights into this new AD medication as I have used previously Lexapro (cipralex) and amitriptyline and bupropion for major depression. I was on lexapro for 3 years, but this SSRI was giving me anxiety, panick attacks, but elevated mood, also had diarrhea and insomnia. 10 Days ago I started to withdraw from Lexapro and had dizziness, high pitch noise in my ear and anxiety. 4Days ago I started Brintellix: Day 1: no noticeable effects Day2: Lowered anxiety Day3: Started feeling calm and having 50% less anxiety, started being more talkative, washed dishes and cleaned the house for 4 hours. Day 4: Woke up after 9 hours of sleep, (slept badly, mom kept me waking up in the morning) overall, in 1 hour i prepped meal for my grandmother, drank coffee, set a blaze a furnice and started EXECISING first time in 5 months for 2 hours, 50% less anxiety still persisted and 30% anxiety converted into excitement and the rest was 20% anxiety which is really minor. Started listening to ne
w songs, my limb weakness disappeared and started positively daydream about my future, what I am going to do and felt positive. So far no side effects, besides still consistent insomnia (can be from Lexapro withdrawal still) I am on 5mg brintellix, one of the lowest dose (maybe I am sensitive to it so it works at this dose) Worth mentioning that it causes nausea more than other SSRI’s but I did not experience, often reported are headaches and itchiness. I might experienced mild itchiness, but it is just a small part. It is worth also mentioning it causes least sexual side effects from all SSRI’s (besides bupropion, which actually caused my _NAME_!)

I get upset when I hear the schizophrenia ads and now since I was diagnosed with HS I only searched it once but I don’t get ads for things I don’t have or haven’t dealt with. I just think this goes too far!!! There’s something called Hippa for a reason but the Internet gets to use your search history to Diagnose you? I don’t want to offend the people who work on these ads but they actually feel demeaning and hurt my self esteem.

174392238,"Negative symptoms and the brain The underlying brain malfunction in schizophrenia is complicated and not well understood, but it almost certainly affects the interaction between the centers of judgment and planning in the prefrontal cortex and the centers of emotion and memory in the temporal lobes and limbic system. One theory is that the brain’s noise level rises when the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate becomes overactive in the prefrontal cortex and at the same time stimulates receptors for another neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the limbic region. According to this theory, negative and cognitive symptoms result directly from the glutamate activity — in part as a defense against the noise — and psychotic symptoms are a byproduct of dopamine activity in the limbic system. But the limbic system also contains the brain’s reward circuits — the place where we learn what to desire and how to recognize the cues indicating that something desirable is on hand. If patients with schizophreni
a often seem to want too little (avolition), it could be the result of malfunctioning in the reward system. The original antipsychotic drugs, introduced in the mid-20th century, worked exclusively by suppressing activity at dopamine nerve receptors in the limbic system. Since the 1980s, a new generation of drugs has taken first place on prescription pads and pharmacy shelves. Because these drugs act on the brain in different and more varied ways, some psychiatrists hoped that they would relieve negative as well as positive symptoms. The results have been disappointing. None of the drugs now available is a specific treatment for schizophrenia. All of them are roughly equally good at suppressing psychotic symptoms and equally ineffective against negative symptoms — whether the source of these symptoms is schizophrenia or another disorder. No drug treatment for negative symptoms is on the near horizon, but the search continues. One approach involves stimulation of the NMDA receptor, which regulates the release 
of glutamate in the prefrontal cortex. If drugs that affect negative symptoms are found, they might be tested on people with schizotypal or schizoid personality, or even on genetically vulnerable family members who may be in the early stages of schizophrenia."

174392249,Are you on meds? Life can be rough sometimes. I’ve been in a funk lately. Just tired of being sick and feeling so tired and numb. Not much can take that feeling away. I’ve tried medical marijuana. I wouldn’t recommend that for anybody though. I’m lucky and don’t have positive symptoms anymore.

Right now I’m in a kind of low mood but nothing severe."

I don’t know how it works.
174392245,"I think Abilify is more effective at treating negative symptoms: Wikipedia Rexulti “Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness. Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the D2 receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, whereas brexpiprazole is the opposite.”"

176194568,"Hello, I started hearing voices 9 years ago. I have doubts about the origin of the voices. I’ve always thought it was a spirit or something else somehow unnatural. i dropped my medication at the beginning of November, and in the middle of mars i started hearing voices more than usual. I had some mystical experiences where i saw a spirit taking off my body and turning around me. I waited a long time to raise my meds because for me it was just true as i’ve always thought, but now i take the same medication than before November and voices are lower. But that doesn’t mean my experiences were not true. I think the spirit have an action on my energetic body and this have an effect on my brain. So meds can have an action on voices. Anyway, i will try to live a life as normal as possible despise all that. Thanks for reading me."

He’s 16 years old now, healthy, not overweight, not underweight, perfect size, he still goes outside everyday, has the energy of a kitten and still likes to play.

During his funeral I played a song. It reminds me of him to this day. I still miss him as well as my other grandparents. I’ll always miss them.

I read the first five pages of chapter one again. Took some notes on the first section. I’m going to spend a month on each chapter, and complete and hopefully master the book within a year. Reading five pages a day is barely anything, together with a little t’ai ji I have a routine that keeps me grounded without stressing me out by lots of work. To be honest, even sticking to these two things, barely half an hour’s worth of concentration, has been difficult for me. The most I’ve ever managed for a daily routine is about an hour a day of study, and then only managed to keep it up for about two weeks max. So sticking to these two little things is a challenge and also something that I should be able to do within my limits. I will be super pleased if I can keep it up for a y

176194694,Who are the forum members on there?
176194695,"Welcome to the forum Queen. A part of me suddenly wants to get married and longs for it but why…really… Before my boyfriend I did not want to marry because it’s to much beauracracy involved and too difficult to divorce if wanted. I have only been with my boyfriend a couple of months and already he has been controlling and called me fat, accused me of cheating, he has a bad temper and pictures of his x wife all over the walls etc But I adore him and can’t stop kissing him etc I can’t marry because I would lose my centrelink pension if I did and they would expect my husband to financially support me which my boyfriend can not afford to do and does not want to do. He made it clear all his money goes to his sons. If I wanted to marry I would have to get a lawyer for prenuptial agreements of seperate economy and also apply for exception to keep my pension. I don’t know why I want to marry all of a sudden because I want sacred union ? Things are good as they are but my boyfriend might have fi
nancial difficulties and be living over his means because now he might rent his place out and wants to live with me rent free which my land lady said no to and if he does anyway which he has said not to tell her I could lose my home. That’s not fair on me and sounds like he is using me or wanting to. He refuses to talk about it. I wanted a gothic wedding with my x boyfriend and his gothic home is the most loving peaceful home I ever had . If I’m smart I wouldn’t marry my boyfriend. It could be a bad thing and his catholic and was married but cheated on his wife.she forgave him but then he cheated again when she had cancer so she divorced him."

176194697,Dude. You’ve been down this road before. You already know you just don’t like the answer. Absolutely no one likes the way they feel on meds. They suck. But it’s worth it because they keep us out of the hospital and at least marginally safer than we are without them.
176194698,That’s an interesting theory. I wonder if it’s true.
176194699,"Yes, this is a big key point, here. If you were her boss, her teacher, or in a supervisory position over her, it would be a problem. The reason that would be a problem would be because she might be afraid to say no to someone who had power over her. That is where it becomes sexual harassment, because she has less ability to say no. But if you were two equal friends goofing around, then she has the right and responsibility to tell you to knock it off if she doesn’t like it. I have had a friend try to play wrestle with me before when I didn’t want it. I froze up, screamed “STOP NOW!” and he backed off and apologized. We both moved on, and remained friends. He wasn’t trying to take advantage, he simply misread my body language and immediately corrected himself. If she didn’t give you any indicator that she was uncomfortable, it’s probably because she wasn’t uncomfortable. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, if she didn’t want you touching her, she would probably have told you. At the very least, 
she would have told a friend who would have then confronted you about it."

176194748,"To be truly free you shouldn’t really need the approval of others, so diagnostically this need for a sz’s, or a psychiatric nurse’s or a psychiatrist’s is self defeating. Most nurses wouldn’t grasp the existential nature of your enquiry and a psychiatrist simply doesn’t have the time to explore these deep and long debates. ‘Let go or be dragged!’ is an expression that comes to mind. ‘Existential ocd’ isn’t really found in the DSM manual, I believe and that is the bible for psychs In regards to depersonalisation, do you lose time? Are you always conscious, except when you sleep? Or is it that you feel spaced out, surreal and alien to your surrounding and body? If it is the latter, then grounding techniques is the first tool any psychologist would advise you to do. And finally, why would this be one of your last posts? You make an interesting debate and are fun to read."

176194763,My experience with anti-depressants is that if it works in the morning to reduce sleepiness you should leave it that way. If you switch to night it will change the time of day you are feeling activated.

174392298,"Hello! First of all I am not a doctor but I’ve searched a ton on genetics because I have a genetic disease. First of all, the gene EGLN1 (OMIM #606525 ) has two entries of conditions on OMIM: familial erythocytosis and high altitude adaptation of hemoglobin. If I am aware of this gene correctly, this gene supplies oxygen to prevent hypoxia (lack of oxygen in blood). Actually, one is a familial genetic disorder, and one is rather a variation that allows someone to adapt to life in high altitudes. Therefore, people with a variation in this gene can adapt better to high altitudes, not have low hemoglobin (unless you have erythocytosis). So rather, the hemoglobin functions well in the variation. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder . Unlike other connective tissue disorders that does affect the bloodstream and the heart more seriously (such as vEDS, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), Marfan does not exclusively cause aortic root dilation or things like that. Anemia is a blood-related dis
order. The gene that targets marfan syndrome is FBN1. Marfan syndrome is a fairly rare disorder, with probability of 1/10,000- 1/20,000. It’s actually rarer than we think. EGLN3 has no OMIM entries on schizophrenia susceptibility. Psychosis and _PERSON_ are said to be related, but it is most likely _PERSON_ syndrome, a very similar disorder that looks like a combination of _PERSON_ and psychosis. In _PERSON_ syndrome, psychosis or any other mental illness is to be expected. It is due to a completely different gene called MED12 ( #300188 ). But I’m not a doctor so I cannot say for sure. However, with the _PERSON_ syndrome and psychosis, a research paper says that the case is most likely referring to a misdiagnosis of _PERSON_ syndrome."

I just sneezed one day and now I’m like this, and it’s been 2 weeks and nothing has gotten better. Seriously. What on earth is wrong with me?"

What should I have done or I am just paranoid his comment was out of line or should I have gotten out of line and went somewhere else?

Good luck!"
176194838,"…why I have such strong physical reactions and emotional feelings when I watch the news, especially about mental illness. This leads to chain of other reactions, such as my dislike of others. I think it’s due to my synesthesia. When I watch a news that exasperates and makes fun of mentally ill people, I get a heavy, burning feeling (literally). It feels like someone is putting 10 pounds of stone inside my chest and pressing it down. My heart drops down and I feel like I have a hole in my chest. Then I keep thinking how cruel people can be. I finally figured it out, I think. All I need to do now is to learn that this is just a way of me feeling pain. I don’t need to think about the injustices of the world, and I need to develop coping strategies around it. I think I have a clearer picture now as to what I can do to work out my negative feelings!"

176194843,"Well, the word “swimmy” is a new one on me, lol. Never heard that word before! The only time in my life that I was too high to drive was after taking mushrooms. I drove drunk and stoned all the time when I was a teenager and once even drove sixty miles at night on LSD but mushrooms were too much for me."
176194844,"So I applied to be a Samaritan. My brother says I wouldn’t be able to cope with the emergency situations that Samaritans are called upon to attend, but he did say there was no harm in going to the open day if I wanted to. I also looked into training to be a councellor, but its a long term commitment and expensive. Right now I want to focus on shiatsu. Given that creations can’t create, there is not much point in learning theory in an effort to create, creation requires no effort, the point of learning theory is to share in creation, creating theory is what I am interested in most, but this is largely a hobby. I think I’ll try to practice my shiatsu routine on my family once a week. My brother was certainly enthusiastic and my father expressed an interest too. That should give me some satisfaction. Thank you."

176194852,"I had a period of tourette’s-esque behavior when I was really psychotic years back. The voices used to instruct me to make signs with my hands, the most common one is the right hand, touching your thumb to your index finger tip to make a circle then extending your other three right fingers out, kind of an a-okay sign. I would do this randomly, and sometimes my body felt willed to do it against my will. I also have said a few things when the voice was “speaking through me.” It’s not tourette’s but it was similar in a lot of regards. I barked something dirty to myself once in the backyard only to turn my head and find my neighbor staring at me from the backyard, she was calling for her dogs to come back in, I was so embarrassed. Glad those days are behind me. I don’t get the ticks anymore like I’ve described, though sometimes my hand will make that sign if I’m really upset. I still don’t understand it."

176194961,? used to have delusion about cleaning the class. ? had a delusion that my cleaning is bad.finally i gave up and accept that delusion. After accept that delusion my cleaning became really bad. So it s important to not believe your delusion.
176194962,I want to know if the older med with new applications got any change in it or just a same old med.

176194966,I realize that my delusions and voices become more intricate as the time passes. It’s a complex system.
176194967,"Everyday. We no longer have a bath so I miss that after sport. Still. In a hot, humid climate you’ve got to shower regular because it’s just so sweaty and nasty. I even washed my hair the other day. Should do it more but I’m not the worst!"
176194968,I would ask to see someone else if its possible. You can’t confide in someone you don’t trust.

176194971,What discouraged our dreams from appearing in the form of a workable plan. Were all of our dreams illegal?
174392344,I really believe there will be a med for negative symptoms because I didn’t have serious negative symptoms when unmedicated or while on Abilify.
176194972,I don’t think it’s FDA approved yet.
176194973,lol nice man your never to young to learn to shoot. dont shoot people or living things okay thats bad i mean targets nonliving things.
176194974,"I hope you don’t die at your desk. Try and have some rest if you can. Personally I think people who have issues that can be life limited should get some form of retirement like those who live to be old. To be fair, I don’t think being super old is that great. You finally get a break from working, then your health slowly crumbles until you die. Not nice. Anyways, on a lighter note, I am pretty sure you like to keep busy like I do working. Plus the money helps!"

These features is the things that you know them be term (hallucinations) !! They are the pathogen of the condition you call it schizophrenia ,and you can not find any other pathogen"

174392347,I feel the same way. Living life as a schizophrenic is so hard. I don’t have hallucinations or voices but the constant agitation. A slight change in my routine completely ruins me for days.
176194988,"I haven’t posted in a long time and I needed somewhere or someone to vent to. Personally I feel like I’m a tormented person… no matter how amazing of an artist I become or a person I become… I’ll forever long for a connection that satisfies my soul! Right now I am madly in love with a woman and I feel like everything I do is wrong and everything she does is wrong! I have a reaccuring theme in my life where I will always choose my art over any woman that comes along… no woman can ever be more important than my art or my journey!! I can truly say the woman I’m in love with now is different, I’ve never cared so much about a person… we’ve hung out plenty and gone on dates but have never hooked up and I’ve known this woman for years now and she has been a part of my journey since I’ve started tattooing… even being like the 5th tattoo I’ve done on a person and since then I’ve done 3 more tattoos on her. I genuinely love this woman unlike anyone else that’s come before her 
but I’ve reached my rope and the theme of my life must play out and I have to let her go in order to move forward… I’ve honestly done everything to keep it together in my opinion… otherwise I think she would’ve done more! I think this is a sad and tragic end . Anyways… here’s a few tattoo pics to go with this vent of how my careers been going lately.IMG_20200710_153520_5303072×3446 1.88 MB"

They said they’ll find a cure in 20 years time, but gene therapy is in the beginning stages and you can die from going into trials with those. I don’t really care, to be honest. Of course I want a cure badly so that I could do the same thing like others! I probably won’t see the cure for both schizophrenia and muscular dystrophy.

176195000,The Gab was prescribed for me by my doc who knew what meds I was on. I didn’t realize there was an issue since I doubled up by accident. It wasn’t intentional. I just missed a point. Point taken. I was under stress.
176195001,"Yeah, my psychiatrist told me about patients on 80mg. That is insane. The recommend max dose is 20mg according to the manufacturer. If I remember correctly… At 40mg I was 240lbs, diabetes, sky high cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar. I wasn’t doing good. I took the initiative to lower my dose on my own cause I was worried I would die from the side effects. I’ve since lost all the weight I gained, my blood work is now normal. I became psychotic again but refused to take more zyprexa. pdoc put me on lurasidone and that has no side effects for me and works way better for my psychosis…"
176195002,"This doctor I speak of has retired now. Not sure there is much point in complaining. I have a new blood test booked for 11th September when I get back from holiday Once I have the evidence, I can then use this to trap the pdoc into actually doing something about this. My problem is that historically, my mother goes into a spin about me messing with my anti-psychotics, so we have agreed to do it this way. I need her on board, as she acts irrationally when it comes to this, as before I have just quit my meds cold turkey This time it will be different. We have a plan. A few more weeks shouldn’t make much of a difference as this has been going on for some time now."

All my senses went haywire I guess. However when I got on meds my world stabilized and I was able to go back to music. Now I listen to music almost every day. Got me a LP player which I never had before and the sound is really cool. Everything in moderation though. It’s tiring to listen to music for hours straight, so enjoy having it quiet as well."

176195057,"I’ve noticed that afternoon is my worst time of day. That chunk of time between the end of lunch, when I’ve got the kids napping, and the beginning of dinner had a way of dragging me down. Maybe it’s meds? I take 1mg haldol in AM. My doctor said minimum I need 2mg but that I should take up to 4mg more if needed. But, I think it might just be that there’s nothing really going on. I’m not having to keep up with kids so everything in my brain gets louder. Right now I’ve been spending that time lifting weights or going on a jog while blasting music in my headphones. The over exercising is a problem as I have anorexia and my team doesn’t want me to exercise at all. It’s a struggle and if I let myself slip into the delusions or derealization it can start a snowball effect and take me out of “reality”. Does anyone else struggle at a certain time of day/night?

174392358,Haldol is unique in that it can have immediate effects. That why in psych hospitals they might give you some haldol on arrival to bring you back to normal quickly. I’m on abilify and that can take a month before it works. But if you’re getting those kind of side effects on haldol maybe it’s not the med for you.

174392368,"It’s not the worst in terms of effect, in fact, it’s by far the best. Studies show that - more or less - every AP, whether typical or atypical, has about the same efficiency. Except for clozapine, which is the best antipsychotic out there. In terms of side effects, though, it’s probably the worst. It’s the worst AP for weight gain and sedation, it can cause severe constipation. Most notable though is how it can decrease white blood cells in .8-1% of people. For this reason, in the United States, if you’re on clozapine you have to have regular blood tests. Weekly for the first six months, every two weeks the following six months, and monthly after that."

I don’t know what to do about the hypersexuality, the beta blocker lowers testosterone, which is helping, but I still get bad cravings and it’s difficult to not be distracted by it.

174392405,"As must who have looked into d-serine probably already know, d-serine has alot of uses ranging from cognitive enhancement to treating depression and schizophrenia. In the studies using 30mg/KG in conjunction with antipsychotics sometimes produced useful effects for patients with schizophrenia, however when used at 60mg+/KG it consistently produced improvements in symptoms. The issue of course is d-serine has a side effect of causing nephrotoxicity, however recent studies( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11049-8 ) seem to indicate this side effect results from declining l-serine levels, in response to increasing d-serine levels. In the study linked, administration of l-serine was able to make redundant the kidney related side effects of d-serine. For those interesting in playing with the NMDA receptors for schizophrenia, depression…etc sarcosine is usually touted as being the superior option, however if d-serine is combined with l-serine perhaps this option might be better? Especially c
onsidering the increased risk of prostate cancer sarcosine has been associated with(though still under dispute but other studies). If d-serine it’s taking at 60mg/KG it consistently produces improvement in symptoms just like sarcosine does. Sarcosine’s effects do ultimately stem from increased d-serine levels in the brain, so maybe for those experiencing side effects from sarcosine or just not responsive to it, could benefit from a d-serine/l-serine combo? I have been taking sarcosine to tackle my schizoaffective disorder with good results, however for some unfortunate reason it has caused me terrible gut issues(horrible constipation and weakened pelvic floor muscles/inability to hold in gas, most of which comes out within minutes of eating anything) - taking zinc/copper supplements helps with side effects sarcosine causes me, but not completely. I may try higher doses of zinc/copper in future but in mean time will start experimenting with d-serine first to see if that works, then add l-serine to the mix 
so my kidney’s don’t call it quits. Incase anyone is wondering doses of sarcosine i have taken have been relatively small, at 500mg/day alone(empty stomach)it helps dramatically with negative symptoms. Music sounds great again, desire to socialize, have more energy, mood much more stable, it’s great. The only other supplements that have ever helped with my symptoms is zinc and copper, have tried all the other stuff that was suppose to help. Off-topic but interestingly, sarcosine is known to be a biomarker of prostate cancer, and people with schizophrenia have less likelihood of getting prostate cancer: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Risk of prostate cancer in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Comprehensive psychiatry , Oct 2014 To examine the rate of prostate cancer in a cohort of schizophrenia in-patients in the PSA-era as compared to expected rates. There is conflicting evidence on the relative risk of prostate cancer in men with schizophrenia.the study sample was comprised of 
schizophrenia patients who had been admitted to a tertiary care mental health center between 1990 and 2011. The data for the sample was cross-referenced with the National Cancer Registry. Analyses of Standardized Incidence Rates (SIR) for prostate cancer and for lung cancer (representing an organ system not sensitive to sex hormones) were performed.Of 4,326 schizophrenia patients included in the present study, 181 (4.2%) were diagnosed with cancer at any site. Only 10 of these patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer. This reflects a reduced risk; SIR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.27-1.03). In the same cohort, 33 schizophrenia patients were diagnosed with lung cancer presenting a SIR of 1.43 (95% CI 0.98-2.01) in this sample.The present study suggests a reduced rate of prostate cancer in patients admitted for schizophrenia. There are several possible explanations for this finding including chronic state of hyperprolactinemia induced by antipsychotic drugs. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Prostate cancer and schizophrenia. _PERSON_, 
Urology , Dec 2006 To assess the incidence of prostate cancer in individuals with schizophrenia.A MEDLINE search was performed for all studies of ""prostate cancer"" or ""cancer"" and ""schizophrenia.""Five studies had age-standardized, site-specific cancer data. All five had a lower standardized incidence ratio for prostate cancer, ranging from 0.49 to 0.76. The incidence of cancer at other sites varied among the studies. Possible explanations included ascertainment bias; genetic factors; antipsychotic drug effects, either by being cancer protective or decreasing testosterone, or both; and lifestyle differences, such as prolonged hospitalization resulting in a decreased opportunity for heterosexual intercourse.The results of this study have revealed that the incidence of prostate cancer in individuals with schizophrenia is significantly lower than expected. Perhaps this could be due to anti-psychotic use as articles suggest or changes in lifestyle they make, still found it to be an interesting link. I believ
e high doses of zinc supplementation have been associated with prostate cancer, but truth be told i don’t remember the dose. The articles i have found only studied dietary intake and found no correlation, but with supplemental intake i believe correlations were found. I add this because zinc, an essential mineral can improve a wide range of conditions, including schizophrenia/depression/other mental illnesses. I find it interesting both sarcosine and zinc that can improve mental illness are also correlated with prostate cancer."

So I never thought I’d work for my dad growing up but then… At 19 I worked for my dad. I was previously mentally ill. Probably schizophrenic because I had positive, negative and cognitive symptoms since I was 13-14. But so my dad was an engineer. His dad was a lawyer. The previous generation lived paycheck to paycheck and barely got by. So my grandfather was probably a 5 foot 5 tall Jewish man who fought in world war 2, went from being poor growing up in the Bronx to being a lawyer and eventually acquiring a office building in New York. Somehow, someway??? Idk . But My dad ran his company out of this building and eventually inherited it. Well his co workers would tell me “this building will be yours one day”. And I was really dumb, young, delusional and whatnot I believed them and wanted it to be so. I was already addicted to drugs and alcohol at this point b

Well it was less than a year later I was hospitalized since after I was exposed to my dads work environment. It was really a bad influence on me. My ego took life for the first time in my life. Plus I had lost my v card sort of and that gave me confidence and stuff. And then I fell in love was chasing this girl and she just was cruel and mean. I was wrong but she was worse. I never tried to hurt her but she TRIED to hurt me. And everybody else. And my delusions were coming to life through drugs. And my friend said all this stuff about my ego and I said I knew. And it was a giant conundrum and some people should mind their own god damn business. 6 months later my mom said to me “you will inherit the building and your sister the ho
use”. And so I started majoring in business because I wanted to and it seemed logical. But I was too psychotic. I ended up having a really bad episode and got arrested 2 more times that year and many close calls also (I was arrested when I was 18 already). So I dropped out of school to deal with my arrest and everyone put delusions in my head in my group. And then my parents sold their business like 2 years later. Well when this happened I was actually relieved. Like phew . My parents are really wealthy since doing this deal. They live very luxuriously. I have no idea how much money they have but my dad is retired but says he still has a steady income through the stock market. They spend a lot of money. I used to have financial anxiety about it and would get mad when they spent too much money on our family. But now I’m like w.e I hope they enjoy their selves. Idc as long as I’m in a group home or something if they died and not out on the streets and homeless. My story."

176195209,not you. I was wondering about _AT_MENTION_
176195210,It hasn’t really been that scary. The symptoms started slowly and my doctor caught it early enough that he thinks it will reverse on my new med.
176195211,"It’s a mental illness. Our minds aren’t functioning properly when we’re in psychosis or suffering from delusions. It’s a troubling thought for me. Before the onset of my symptoms, I had a reputation for being very smart and dependable. This was a huge part of my self-image and self-esteem. My life was very difficult when I was younger. Among other things, I was awkward and terrible at sports, so I was badly bullied for my appearance and lack of athleticism. For me, my brain made up for that. Now I have to accept that I’m pretty severely mentally ill at times. I know for a fact that my delusions are not real though. I’ve had enough experiences to prove them wrong and to make me look foolish when trusting them as well. It hurts."
176195212,"I don’t see any “evil” there but 18 years old seems too young to marry and take on all that responsibility of a wife and two kids and all that goes with it. And no offense but I kind of wonder about a 28 year old woman who would marry an 18 year old. I wonder if she had issues with men her own age and I wonder a little if she had some motive that wasn’t apparent. I’m just speculating. As to the good vs evil thing. I would just say that you’re troubled, but you’re troubled in your own way. After talking and knowing people who were homeless, I would say that maybe you had to do things you’re not proud of just to survive. It is what it is."

Definitely you should come to this site more often to interact with others so you can have a little socializing and support. I do reading almost everyday which makes me connected to the author’s thinking and feel less lonely and isolated, especially when you read those articles that talks about the philosophies of human existence, happiness, love, ignorance, misunderstanding, etc. Often I felt like the author is one of my friends when I was reading. For example I used to read _NAME_ books. He thinking gives me insights and strength."
176195216,"Hopefully the fact that you have shared this will take some of the edge off it. I can relate to a number of things you’re saying, the ones makes me officially ‘psychotic’ in the eyes of my doc. All the best."

174392431,"No, it ain’t that easy. Never heard of anyone curing their schizophrenia by will power or positive thinking. You will not "" think yourself"" out of this disease. The reason is simple; if it was possible, then it would have been done by everybody a long time ago. And it would have been publicized all over the world, and every psychiatrist would treat their patients illness by recommending it. That said, living by those principles for someone with schizophrenia would probably help. Living by those principles could help someone live a better life. It’s good to have a purpose in life and be a good person and help others and improve yourself etc. Speaking from experience, I was a drug addict and lived that lifestyle for four years. During that time, I didn’t give a damn about anything except getting my drugs. I didn’t care much about living a clean productive helpful life. I didn’t care about helping anyone or being a good person or having a purpose. But I eventually got clean in AA and a hug
e part of AA is self improvement. The AA program is not just about quitting drugs; there’s much, much, more to it. It’s about being honest and living by a set of principles. It’s about improving yourself and your life. But I’m bringing up AA because it changed my life. And I’m bringing it up because I turned my life around and I lived by what they taught me. I was gung-ho in the program the first 5 years. I tried to live a principled, moral, honest life. And I succeeded in many ways. BUT…all the positive changes made me happier, and I got a lot out of it and made good things happen in my life but it didn’t cure me. Living a good life helped my recovery in many ways. Like a said, I was happier and more productive and living a principled life brought me many good things. It helped make my life better and it put me n a position to help other people. That’s why when I walk around in public now, I get smiles and approval occasionally. People can spot that I’m not out to hurt anyone or cause troub
le. And that makes me happy too! So yes, there’s definitely benefits in living a good life and working on yourself. But my last advice when it comes to improving your life is don’t take on too much. None of us are perfect and trying to be perfect will just frustrate and cause it’s own problems."

I would say it just takes a lot of work and you have got to have some hope that you will find someone who is good at what they do, has a kind heart, and is emotionally stable themselves. I think I was very lucky to find good doctors over the years. The one I found today and met with is great for several reasons."

176195349,"_AT_MENTION_ I’d just be careful of RSI (repetitive strain injuries) which can occur when working full-time on CAD. That unfortunately happened to me as the work was so repetitive & continuous 40 hrs/week. I worked in an office full time for about 8 years. I found the pressure to perform socially was immense… maintaining workplace relationships, managing office politics, keeping a difficult manager happy. It caused me a lot of stress & tension. I was told I was not approachable enough & too withdrawn. So keep in mind that you may be expected to be approachable & social to some degree 40 hrs/week. I also found it difficult to concentrate. It was very stressful to force myself to concentrate 40 hrs/week, sitting at my workstation in front of a computer. I used a lot of coffee & sugar. Personally, in my mid 40’s now, I prefer to work shifts in a library where I’m on my feet doing physical labour (manual handling) or serving customers. I have a different manager each shift so if I have a mean m
anager it doesn’t upset me. Same goes for office politics, I’m not there long enough to be savvy about who’s doing what. I don’t need to concentrate long as my tasks are short & change a lot. I enjoy serving customers - a lot of them are kind & appreciative which improves my mood. My responsibilities are simple so I don’t get stressed about that, I can always hand any major issues over to my shift manager."

On the other hand if you love you start to forgive people for what they did to you and you no longer need to carry those bad incidents in your head. You start to trust people and fear reduces, you feel peace in your life. Ultimately when you die which one gives peace to your mind and body and its love only. Also think of this fact. When someone do a crime like murder, rap@, abuse etc what they have in their mind at that time towards the other people. Its hate and not love and their action is simply the after effects of their hatred towards him. If its love they would never do it and instead care for the other person. If you carry hatred your actions and the results you achieve will also be like this."

176195366,"As an antipsychotic user, I am worried about movement disorders and diabetes. This is why I find the following interesting: There have been clinical trials performed where patients took their medication every other day for 6 months, and there were no relapses. This would SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the amount of drugs we have to take. So why has there not been more investigation into this? And would you be comfortable taking your antipsychotics every other day? “Participants stabilized on their antipsychotics were asked to take their antipsychotic medication every other day for 3 months, with a second 3-month window in which those who remained stable could reduce their dose to every 3 days. The study included 13 participants, 6 of whom completed the 6 months; only 1 participant, who stopped antipsychotic treatment entirely, relapsed.68 Among the remaining 6 participants, 5 withdrew consent over the course of the 6 months, although in no instance was withdrawl tied to symptom exacerbation; the sixth indi
vidual was withdrawn because of active substance abuse, an exclusion criterion. These pilot data set the stage for a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial69 in stabilized outpatients with schizo phrenia comparing extended dosing (n = 18), here defined as alternate day dosing, with treatment as usual (TAU; n = 17). As in the first study, eligible individuals did not have to be asymptomatic to participate; it was only required that they be stabilized on their antipsychotics. Individuals in the extended dosing group did not show an increased risk of symptom exacerbation (Fig. 2) or hospital admission; more individuals in the TAU group required hospital admission over the 6-month interval.” jpn.ca 39-4-223.pdf 353.81 KB"
176195367,"I came back to school 18 years later and got an associate’s degree in History. Getting the degree amounted to deciding when to kiss the teacher’s ass, and knowing the material ahead of time. I also took one class at a time. I ended up with an identity crisis because I didn’t always write the way I believed (ass kissing) and when my father died and my Mom got very sick I began to relapse. I got the degree but ended up in the Psych ward and came out never able to function at the previous level again. I also became afraid to teach with the growing political partisanship in my country. When I also found out how difficult it was to get around living on my own without the ability to drive the degree became pretty worthless as my mind atrophied, I learned what the purpose of the Ticket to Work was, and I became immersed in the welfare system."

174392459,"They’re different but you could have derealization and psychosis at the same time. Derealization I guess for me was caused by real trauma and severe anxiety. Nobody believes it though… It can be induced from smoking pot, migraines, temporal lobe epilepsy, and personality disorders. I looked into DP/DR extensively. I would see a doctor. It’s pretty telling you might or think you have schizophrenia because you identify and are on a schizophrenia forum. I used to be on an autism and dp/dr forum before realizing I had severe, unrelenting psychosis. My dad used to think I would be normal if I quit the energy drinks. I’m currently being treated as a schizophrenic. I have the diagnosis as well as others. The APs can make DP/DR worse. It depends. Certain SSRIs and mood stabilizers can help but there is no cure or med exclusively. It’s an extremely common condition but lacks recognition and treatment and support. I would talk to a doctor. I had it so bad I thought I was in a hell-like state or exi
stence. I don’t think derealization has anything to do with past lives, which I assume remembering and believing in them is a delusion. Simulation theory, on the other hand, could end up being a delusion but also could be philosophical. I had OCD and philosophical rumination 24/7. That’s pretty common with DP/DR. Childhood trauma is common too."

176195400,"I wouldn’t think to much about physical things. I mean if there’s nothing you can do then forget about it. People have stolen things from me in the past and it does suck, but in time I let it go and now I only use those experiences to not make the same mistake again in the presence, by trusting the wrong people or being careless so that my things get taken. I remember when I was in my early 20’s, my girlfriend left me in a very brutal way and I just wanted to die for a couple of weeks. I think it took me about 10 years to let it go, maybe 15 years. I thought I couldn’t live without her in the beginning. And even though I don’t want her any more, the experience has left a scar on my soul forever. But I still want to meet somebody new and try to have a life, but it’s very scary, and also very difficult because I’m disabled with psychosis. Many people will drop you like a hot potato if they know you have issues. It’s true. But there are also other people who know the pain I have known 
and are willing to accept people and things that most wouldn’t. Although my life has been a ramble, hope sustains me. I believe there is something better out there. If I stopped having hope I would be in a very dark place. Life can be hell, it’s true, but it can also be heaven or something nice. But the journey begins in our mind.

174392466,"Complex delusions are exactly that. Complex. Some of them are more complicated–and some of us just wish people could see what we can. I don’t know some people can tap into my conscious energy so I don’t believe that all of existence is inside a personal box–meaning that perspectives can change and not everything you believe in is a “delusion” its just not conformed with the social norms. A complex is a fixed belief that aren’t breakable often our own beliefs shape them and they evolve. Everyone has a complex, though. The so called social normal people have the very same complex identities like us–but are more likely to watch CNN and believe what the government tells them is true over thinking big picture or stepping outside the box. _PERSON_ wasn’t normal and dropped out of high school. Not everyone is perfect–but sometimes its easier when a person whose been through episodes themselves can tell you that the consciousness of a schizophrenic is adaptive to the current social syst
em. Maybe my delusions are more complex–of course my actual delusion is that there are only beliefs–and delusions are just beliefs that others don’t recognize as real–because the world is an illusion and the only way to see beyond the veil is to believe in a different perspective. Does not actually solidify any of our personal fears or beliefs, often the less fear-based are more likely to be true."
174392470,I think finding the correct dose of AP will help to reduce as much negative symptoms. Little more dose creates more negative symptoms.

I take 1 milligram as prescribed and don’t abuse it and it simply works, I don’t like it cause of it’s _USER_ID_ side effects but decided out of all the meds I’ve tried in my life time this was the best. Now what can I do? Just go down with the ship and lose my life? Get a new Doc? Lose my income just cause a doc wants a med change or doesn’t want to prescribe it. Albeit I’ve read how addictive Klonopin is but I’m not an addict I’m using it to live , maybe I’ll have to die now? I just don’t know who to talk to or what to do?? Going to another doctor seems deceiptful but also talking to this one to beg or plead seems desperate. I’ve been on Klonopin ( after trying every med available to mankind ( I’m 52 years o
ld) abiding to the doctors recommendations on sticking to the meds even though the side effects were horrible) for about 5 years, never abused it cause I’m not an idiot - I’m just trying to survive in this world … and now just like this, I have to feel intense tension , irritability – I know I may have built up a slight addcition to 1 milligram of this med, naturally as it is a benzo. Is my minut addiction even harmful compared to all I’m accomplishing while on this med? If it works why change it!?

176195440,"I had that delusion. Thought I had a brain chip. Turns out it was just adrenochrome buildup from chronic brain inflammation due to a weak blood-brain barrier and intestinal lining. The chronic brain inflamed state triggers the release of adrenaline, which accumulates in the brain and doesn’t metabolize properly due to the inflammation. It instead oxidizes and forms adrenochrome, which causes you to trip 24/7 much like LSD does. LSD’s mechanism of action is increasing adrenochrome secretion, so it’s basically the same thing."

I can’t explain this to this day. and also that same night, I was hiking along the side of the road and the overhead road signs kept changing. one moment it said “fort royal” the next moment it would read “Vienna”. this messed with me. and lastly that same night, there was a security wall that continued to grow taller. going from like 12 feet high to 40 feet high. I was hallucinating quite a bit that night, visually, I usually don’t hallucinate visually. just hear things."

It’s a life skills program that includes a nutritionist and a personal trainer for those of us that need to lose weight. I’m really excited about that part.

176195455,"Lumateperone has very low D2 activity. It peaks out around 40% at the usual dose and rapidly diminishes through the day - that is probably why it doesn’t have the same side effects as others that are in the 60-70% range. MIN-101/Roluperidone acts on serotonin and sigma receptors. No known direct dopamine action. SEP-363856 acts on TAAR 1 and probably others. Although it does not block dopamine, in mice it normalizes presynaptic dopamine synthesis. So rather than block it after the hope is to make as normal an amount as possible in the first place. KarXt is an M1 and M4 agonist with a blocker to prevent the peripheral side effects it would cause otherwise."

176195459,"Yes, I have often felt that way. And also immortal because I’ve tried to kill myself twice. The first time the nurses and doctors have no idea how I survived. It’s still a mystery. The second time, I was physically stopped, syringe already in a central line with my hand on the plunger. I wrestled to try to get it, but ultimately ended up in the hospital only for a week that time. I’ve been hospitalized 9 times for suicidal ideation. Each time I had a plan, but made it to the hospital in time. Death by suicide often feels inevitable to me. But, I’m trying to be positive today, so I’ll stop that. One positive thing that came out of my last attempt, which was less than a year ago, was that all the things I’ve been anxious about (dumb things like speaking to a dr I think doesn’t like me or worrying what people think of my parenting) sort of vanished. I could have been dead. Then it wouldn’t have mattered what they thought. I’m not sure I’m making sense, but a lot of anxiety went awa

One thing that finally made me feel less center stage was the (and I’m gonna butcher this) but it’s that black holes keep a copy of the info aspect of what falls into them in their perimeter, their circumference more accurately. This was my dad regurgitating what he read a couple years back, at any rate. I spoke two days ago about how wherever we gaze at the stars with our telescopes it appears that we are the center of the universe. But in me; with the black hole weirdness it actually takes pressure off of this feeling that we are center stage. Does that make you wonder at all?"
176195481,Well they had me on zyprexa haldol and depakote and I stopped depakote myself and my doctor tapered me off zyprexa. And so I just had haldol 10 mg but in January I cut the haldol down to 5 mg myself I still have to tell the doctor but now I’m trying to switch to something weaker!!

174392481,"Funny you should mention that. Many mental health workers are trained not to call a person “schizophrenic” the idea is taught that we are people first. Trust me, should a person ever disclose their illness to someone who is unaware of it, unfortunately, saying, “I’m schizophrenic.” gets a worse reaction than saying, “I suffer from schizophrenia.” The first one invokes thoughts of numerous news articles to some while others think “schizo” (or as sometimes they pronounce… ‘skitso’) which has a negative connotation and is viewed as a derogatory term by many people afflicted with such an illness. While the latter might make the listeners slightly more sympathetic in their judgement because after all, having schizophrenia does make a person suffer. Either way usually nothing good comes of it except newfound reasons to be judged and I do not recommend informing anyone of such a thing unless necessary. What else can we be called? Lunatics? I guess it would make life significantly e
asier if I could just say I have an illness, without having to add the word “mental”. Heck, we should start a movement. Having a “brain disease” sounds more scientific and less like a psychiatrist disorder. Technically, it wouldn’t be a lie either. We should all just say, “I have an illness.” And if pressed or asked why it isn’t visible, answer, “It is a brain disease.” (For some reason “disease of the brain” sounds worse heh.) People will likely think we’re slow or have some mental impediments, but eh, it is a cognitive disability. Maybe we should say, “an incurable brain disease”… then people will likely think it is some form of cancer. Just don’t forget to add, “Oh but don’t worry, it’s not contagious.” On a side note, it might actually start as a disease in the gut that later affects brain function."
174392479,Just obeying the law is your best bet. Accept you can’t own a gun. Why specifically do you want one? Are you under attack? Are you being threatened?

One is natural, other is altered. Eating is really that simple. We don’t need an authority on how to eat. We can just eat what’s found in nature. Just throw away factory/junk stuff and we good. Clever marketing weightwatchers. Round em up and take their money."
176195540,When will it end? I’m guessing never.
176195541,it could be paranoia but it also could be real huh… why do you think this?
176195542,I sleep all day if I don’t drink 2 cups of strong coffee in the morning and 2 cups of strong black tea around 6 pm.
176195543,"Uh, the last time was about 8 years ago. In the long term hospital around 1981 I had been in for several months and this new patient came in. He was huge, from the looks of him I thought he must have played a little football in college. I didn’t think I had any problem with him but one day we were out on the back lawn and he had a paper cup with a little lemonade at the bottom and he dumped it on my head and then got in my face. I was surprised and my first thought was to punch him. But I knew I didn’t stand a chance so I just walked away. Funny thing was that after that, he seemed to like me and was friendly. Well, just 8 years ago I was living by myself in a studio in an apartment complex for seniors and the disabled and that exact same guy moved in. I hadn’t seen him in over 35 years and we both had gotten old. Actually, a friend of mine there saw him first and the big guy told him the lemonade story and my “friend” started bugging me about it and laughing and wouldn’t let it go. But 
I used to see him and I would sat hi and there was no animosity. My friend told me that the guy told him that the reason the guy tried to start a fight in the hospital was because he was hearing voices telling him that I wanted to hurt him."
176195544,"Well, I mean this in a nice way but, you never know until you try."

176195548,"I just wanted to hear, has any - one else experienced these side - effects, some of them a quite miserable, just sad . ."
176195549,"I get odd looks all the time, and _AT_MENTION_ im known for going down the corner shop for milk in my slipppers with no teeth in, in the morning lol. Alot of people stare at my half an ear - especially little ones."
176195550,Yes thank you. It’s been stable and good for atleast a year. I was my best I’ve ever been I think till I lowered my medication and got a bit depressed but i nolonger have voices and nolonger am delusional. Thankful for the forum and you guys.
176195551,"I’ve tried squared breathing, meditation and talking to my husband and treatment team. Nothing seems to help"

176195555,Some days yes and some days no
176195556,"It depends on the person with regard to side effects. Mine were not dramatic at all and just caused symptoms to disappear gradually. Hope its the same for you. The most other drugs did for me is make me sleepy, lethargic or not have periods…until i found the right one thst didnt do any of those things."
176195557,Oh i would love to get into woodworking. Even going so far as to be a cabinet maker would be a lot of fun i think. Its hard doing woodworking though in canada because of all the long winters and i dont have a garage. Not sure what i will do yet thats hands on…was thinking learning about wilderness survival skills at one point.
176195558,"Just recently I’ve started to cancel out the worries in my life that I can’t do anything about, and this includes political and social issues. The only thing even remotely political I’ve thought about recently was whether or not to wear a mask. I decided I would wear one, which I’ve been doing for a few weeks now. But that is something that is in my control. I’m really happier now since I started to become less. . . opinionated. I don’t even know if I’ll vote this year since I just turned 18 on monday."
176195559,"You’re right. I am in a much better place than I was last year. I shouldn’t psych myself out or I might get psychosomatic symptoms. I will stay on top of things and keep being cheery. On the plus side, if I do get depressed, it will be a good opportunity to talk about depression with my son. He has depression, and it would probably be a comfort to know that adults can feel that way too, and we can still live the lives we choose despite that."
174392494,I’m really going downhill since I stopped Beta Alanine. I’d no choice as I was getting muscle pains. But geez. My negatives have got really worse. Also there’s been a cognitive decline. I’m taking abilify really early in the day now to compensate but it’s not really working.

176195561,Does any one have it where there voices create crazy stories like with me I thought I was talking to egiption gods and a princess from another planet and the earth was going to ascend and we were going to get another moon that was red and that the illuminati was trying to stop all this with their minds and would have battles with heaven with the mind. And every time I smoked a ciggoret it would open up heavens defense cuz I was jesus the body of heaven and the illuminati would create hell there. I also thought in the begging of all this that there was a syndicate of evil psychis that where trying to control me cuz I had power and my dad was behind it cuz my mom told me he used to do voodoo and that my grandma cursed me. I was also thinking I was talking to all these different lizard spririts and angles. This went on for years now the voices say that they had put ever one in separate domes and that they did this to test people and would torture them for varying amount of types of tourture and time so
me got it for billions of years some didn’t get tourted at all and they say I am the only one that didn’t pass cuz I smoke ciggs and cant do certain things with my mind like block thoughts they send me or think. They say for smoking so much iam going to hell for ever and the one that they have ever done this to and they hate me more than any person ever. They say that iam gonna get rapped and eaten by dogs for masterbating after I die and when some one passed the test they kill them send them to hell then make them a god. Has any one else get crazy stories from there voices or is it just me?
174392501,"I think that there’s some part of you that’s still holding onto reality, because if you were absolutely certain that this delusion were true, you wouldn’t be discussing it on this forum in the first place. If you can log onto a website that literally has the word “schizophrenia” in the title, then you haven’t completely lost touch with reality. Please. I’m begging. You need to get yourself to a hospital right now while you still can."

176195564,"I don’t know if this is available near you, but I react poorly to SSRIs so I had to do a nonmedical treatment for my OCD. I did neurofeedback for 12 years and it was so helpful! I no longer even have OCD as a diagnosis anymore, and I used to have an awful case."
176195565,"i am not even going to entertain any of this further. You need to go see your psychiatrist about this, possibly a med adjustment. i mean its possible to function with delusions, ive done it myself. but when it gets in the way of your functionality thats when you really gotta get sorted."
176195566,"I am almost ready to become a full blown vegan. I will just finish eating the cheese etc I already have in the fridge but I plan to only do vegan shopping from now on.see how it goezzz.might help me lose weight I gained this last year (over five kg).i gained weight when I became vegetarian because of cheese perhaps. I received my vegetarian starter kit. I met my father who is visiting from interstate and my sister. He looks older and more frail since he injured his back and my _PERSON_ probably looks younger than him based upon photos I’ve seen despite that she is older but he still looks good for his age and for having been in hospital probably over a month. She calls him dad.(my sister) Why can’t I call him that? I have had delusions that my parents were not my parents but mainly that my father is not my real father. He always used to complain about me when I was a child …that I was not smart enough,not pretty enough etc Everything he complained I wasn’t my sister was. He told his x girlf
riend that he only wanted one of his children and that’s her. She is everything he ever wanted and I’m everything he did not want. He has become nicer to me the older I get though. Apart from him disliking my hair colour he only had kind words. My sister was thoughtful and kind to him which is good. I just don’t have that relationship with him. I believed he molested me and had memories of him taking my virginity and telling me if I lived him I would not scream despite that it stung and I was only a child but they told me from the start that is not a real memory it is a delusion. Maybe it’s because of all my delusions I have had about him… Maybe it’s because I don’t have his love like she does … I love him. I do. I never felt loved by him though. Never felt it was mutual but just me living him unconditionally. I was his mother’s favourite grand child she always said so. I can’t be everyone’s favourite. Some people may hate me Hate is such a strong word .so forbidden. I felt very hated by 
my x boyfriends friend and his fiancé. Maybe my father and I have a good relationship “in spirit”. He told his x girlfriend he wishes he only had one child and that’s her. He did not want my bro n me. She is thinking of becoming pregnant. My father said to me I should never have children. But not her. She should breed because she has the qualities according to him that says she is good enough to breed/have children. I am not comfortable with my brothers and sister. They had a different upbringing. They seem to think I should salute them or something or that they are in some higher rank than me or something but I’m the oldest. They have careers and education. I am on disability pension. Who am I close to… My sacred neigh… The “invisible one”…who is with me in spiritual way? I’m definitely not daddy’s girl. My sister is. I don’t know if he likes me. I’m everything he hates. He hates people that don’t work but the last few years he said I had it difficult and that it’s ok for me. I 
hope he loves me. I never felt loved by him as a child or young adult but he has been so good to me sometimes and really helped me. He gave me a job ok admitingly I thought it was strange that he wanted to make his girlfriend rich (he made her a millionaire)(but would never try to make me rich because he believes I do t have it in me )and not me but I was grateful then I got drunk and told his colleagues and etc he molested me and embarrassed him and he still forgave me and said he still loves me and still wants contact with me. Maybe he really does love me. I like to think so.hope so. I do love him and when I was a child I adored him but he hurt me so much when he was always complaining that I was never good enough etc I want to have a good healthy relationship with him. He has a relationship with my sister very different. When I had cancer he held my hand and cared for me and said he is proud of me. He has been good for how good is that to care for me when I had cancer, to hold my hand when I was afraid . I 
feel so lonely. I need to talk with my sacred neigh and the woman who said she’s my mum and a few others. Also my mum I may of laughed with her in spirit the other day. I hope my father loves me and that our relationship will get better but maybe we are close in spirit but not in person and wonderful news is we laughed together on the phone. To laugh with my parents is very very precious to me as I don’t laugh very often and as to my strange relationship with them . It was perhaps a couple or few months ago but my father and I laughed together on the phone. Blessed it be. I am very happy for him that he is better from his surgery and that he is so happy with his wife. It was sad to see him more frail looking than last time but he had spent a long time in hospital and the dr said it will take many months to recover."

176195583,"So I have always had this problem, but it’s getting much worse at the moment. When I am thinking, I get intrusive thoughts - which according to my psychologist a year ago, everybody gets them However, what I find is they’re pretty much just like audible voices in the way they behave They give me advice, comment on everything, criticise me and make me do things when I am not sure what to do. It’s almost like any lapse in the intensive thought processing, this seems to happen. They’re so clear cut, it’s undeniable that this is an issue. I do not appreciate the psychologist being so dismissive, but on the other hand I don’t want to talk to my pdoc about this due to my drivers license renewal in a few months. Is this SZ? ASD? GAD? Depression? I lose track of what does what."
