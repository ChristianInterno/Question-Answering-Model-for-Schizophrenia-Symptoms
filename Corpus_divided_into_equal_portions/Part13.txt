176020080,"There was recently a topic, but i couldnt find it anymore, and couldnt remember if it had a poll, where people talked about needing to always increase the dose of meds. Sorry it is double, but i was wondering with a poll how many of you actually experience this. Im contemplating whether i should try withdrawal (not now) or staying on this dose or upping the dose. I think more meds would make me more stable and thus give my parents a sense of stability and safety. I know i would personally hate it, but it might help them. Im especially afraid though of getting addicted and needing ever increasing doses and eventually not benefitting from meds anymore. Do you? often need to up or change meds because they stop working sometimes need to up or change, or need to make minor changes, because they stop working need no such thing, have been stable on this med and dose for a long time use meds too shortly or not at all 0 voters"

Clozapine 100mg, three tablets at night Cogentin 2mg, twice daily Levodopa 25/100mg, three times daily They have diagnosed me schizoaffective, with Parkinsonism because of the effect the anti-psychotics have on me, for ten years now. The clozapine is helping me sleep but not helping with the voices. Is anyone here, formerly on clozapine, that switched to Caplyta and had a good result? Thank you everyone for your time.

"" Cancer Registrar Job Duties They make abstracts of medical records by translating the medical terminology into standardized codes that record the patient’s diagnosis and treatment information. Cancer registrars are responsible for compiling and reporting data from all the medical facilities that treat a patient."" Pay scale is roughly $30-60k, hourly wage is roughly $15-28. USD. Sounds niche-y enough that there might not be a lot of competition, but important enough that you’ll get paid a good amount. More than minimum wage for remote work sounds pretty good for entry level. You need the Certified Tumor Registrar (CTR) credential to do work with this. There’s also REV , which allows you to make money by captioning videos.

176020099,"I’m sorry. Grief is a total nightmare, and it doesn’t follow a linear progression to recovery. You will have periods of feeling better and worse about it for the rest of your life. For now, like _AT_MENTION_ said, there are lots of grief support groups and grief counselors around. In my country, hospice networks provide them as a free service. Talking about it seems horrible, but it’s so helpful. Even non-psychotics have delusions like that when it comes to grief. My mom was 100% convinced that my dad would be furious at her if she didn’t leave fresh flowers on his grave every day, despite him saying he didn’t even care if he had a grave. When you talk with others about it, you’ll see that you’re not alone, and that your thoughts aren’t so uniquely crazy. Other people can relate, and can help you move forward. I have loads of grief left from my dad, and that was 13 years ago. You can message me about it any time if you want. I have had some really weird and sucky experiences with gr

It sucked but I felt super accomplished after. And each job was only 5 minutes of effort, a break, 5 more, a break, and so on. Work is limited to 5 minutes, breaks are however long or many youneed.

176020125,Yeah unfortunately Tylenol is pretty weak. Hopefully your doctor will give you something stronger.
176020126,Yes it really suckd
176020127,Something that might help you is just accepting the symptoms you have and working on them individually. Cause the label of diagnosis can be comforting and helpful but the most important part is treating symptoms.
176020128,"i have had a couple, one in a study for SZ, they sent me the pic’s, which is why I agreed to the study"
176020129,Its easing but there is still advice to avoid going out unless very necessary we can meet people but not inside their home and we still need to maintain the distance.
176020130,My pdoc just asks me the same round of questions every time I see her then prescribes meds. It’s pretty routine. Almost unnecessary. So I could see how I could easily get by without her as long as I was able to get my meds. If I was switching meds I could see where her advice might be valuable though.

I have yet to experience a day/night where I don’t hear the entities speaking while hearing a machine/computer noise throughout my body/head/region above my head. It has moved my body at times while making these noises which irritates/frightens me greatly. Interesting information you have mentioned! What/who relayed this information or what led to these conclusions for you personally? I’m intrigued to find out if they run parallel to anything that I experience day-in-day-out.
176020132,I wish that thought would go away.

There’s negative and neutral ones too, but they are the minority. Other than that I try not to think about it too much. I’d hate for everything to go blank and there to be nothing more, and I worry about how I’d handle a terminal diagnosis, but hopefully it won’t come to that. It’s out of your power to control, that’s the part that’s probably important to grasp. I have problems with it too sometimes."
176020164,"It was a strong memory for me. N happened during my first episode of psychosis. I was trying to escape the hospital and I was very passionate about getting out of there,for specific reasons. The police person tried to stop me with force but I believed that I needed to get out of there for specific reasons. So I bit the police person. It didn’t work. They are very strong and fast!!!"
176020165,"The father of my maternal great aunt’s 1st husband was an alcoholic who ended up in an asylum, He had severe memory problems.

176020166,"I know the feel. I was dependent on this supplement, Daily Essential Nutrients, to give me an even mood. I stopped taking it for cost reasons for a few days and it was like the joy of anything was sucked out of my life. Life felt emotionless and robotic. I would gladly pay $120 a month not to feel like that, so I went back on it. I’ll take it for life, I guess."

174346841,"I understand your reluctance, I’ve been there, and so had my aunt. I’ve told her story before on here. She had schizophrenia and didn’t take meds. One day she woke up seeing men in black suits that weren’t there. She got in her helicopter to run away and ultimately ended up in a fatal crash. I know medications could be better, but please be patient with them. New medications are in the works but it will take time. Until then we have to do with what we have. I hope you feel better soon, and know that you can trust your doctor, he just wants to give you medication that will quiet your mind down. Making it easier to think."

Maybe it’s worth trusting this NHS trust more than your previous one, as you have said yourself they were the ones who sorted the ASD issue the other Trust in Essex missed for all those years… Sometimes these things require some fine tuning. I suffered majorly due to a diagnosis of Drug-Induced Psychosis when I was 17, as I was on AP’s for a couple of years, and eventually relapsed off meds and was placed in a very vulnerable and dangerous situations where I was lucky to have no been killed or put in prison - but got told I had Paranoid Schizophrenia. That’s why I view the diagnostic process as very significant, as without it people treating cannot get it right. If the mood issues exist, but are more of a side issue, they may not diagnose it, or in your case, they might review. They tell me I have depression and anxiety, but I have no official diagnosis, and I am treated with meds for the anxiety
. Either way if it results in better treatment and understanding I don’t think it’s a bad thing. I would however be making a complaint about the mis-diagnosis - if that’s the case, as this can cause so many problems with being put on potentially damaging meds you don’t need. Overall I think you have more faith in this team vs. your previous, so I would consider if it was me how strongly I felt the quality of treatment where you are now is vs. what the others were like, and whether you can have faith I cannot answer that, as I have only been treated by the same trust all my life as I have not moved out of my hometown yet Wish you the best with it _AT_MENTION_ I am just giving you my thoughts on the issues relating to your thread. I hope it doesn’t come across wrong - Just trying to help you if I can as you have my respect."

176020185,They didnt give you an SSRI at first?
176020186,"The meds work in completely different ways. They have a good chance of working, and this time they will be working on the specific problem you have. If you no longer have symptoms that could be combatted by aps then it will probably be a good move. I want to do it myself at one point. In fact I am getting a bit inpatient waiting for my next pdoc appointment and I might go to my gp."
176020187,yeah great job matey. I do physical things and it’s hard work but I’m 50. Makes it so much harder on these pills to lose but I appreciate your effort and results. That does inspire me to do better!

It’s just I feel like a robot sometimes, just going through the motions, controlled by the meds. I’m not real anymore. Oh well, gotta take them I guess. I’m an ass without meds so I better take them. Do you ever just not want to take yours even though you know you have to?"

176020204,Hello all im sure some of you will remember me for the shocking side effects I got from Risperdal and other meds I am 30 years old now and came a long way since I first started posting on here Well I have been away for a while trying to fix my life and its still real tough but I have a new lady love in my life now I have other health problems now which I’m trying to sort I have been getting messages regarding the genital effects of risperdal to which I can confirm it does have a lasting effect but… things are much better and sex is pretty great again I do still suffer from effects but its much improved I think the best thing is to give yourself time and rest and certain supplements work well to Its mostly in the standing position that the effect happens now but when sitting resting it goes away mostly also weight gain still remains on me to and my breasts are bigger a bit still but tbh I had high estrogen anyway How does this effect happen? Its a rare side effect it can happen from blood flow is
sues and prolactin its not fully going to impact you because you will regain some power down there its a matter of time and also using supplements or meds to help I do not use viagra or any other medicated drive drug Ok so what can help this genital effect? Try taking saw palmetto and horny goats weed is good stuff also is zinc and many other supplements also lots of protein to and eat red meat and chicken It may seem not as impressive but becoming a grower not a shower is not a bad thing Abilify did restore my sex drive permanent with increased genital size but I did have a bad reaction so had to stop it however… I found Mirtazapine/Remeron was the go to med for me also things like ativan are good to Mental health is a long term for life battle all we can do is try are best to stay strong I hope this thread brings comfort to others who have been posting about this effect and messaging me since I have been away from here The best thing to do is to remain positive and to try your best to improve your situati
on and not fear or worry over things like _NAME_ When you find a women/man who loves you things will also improve So young men keep your head up! I strongly recommend seeing your GP/Doc if you experience urology problems with Risperdal or other meds of same type he can refer you to a urologist and also get your bloods checked to Sometimes these things happen and it can also be because of weight gain and general wear and tear and lack of blood flow as you get older Anyway I hope everyone is doing good here and wish everyone peace and love Thank you

And that can cause a lot of trouble and make the problem or situation worse. I find just tackling it as soon as possible is the best route whether I feel like it or not. My dad tried to teach me to do things as soon as they come up i.e. if the tread on my tire is worn go that same day to get a new tire installed. If I get forms from the DMV or Social Security fill them out right away etc. I never learned but I do well enough on taking care of business.

They’re not going to single you out for abuse. Something like a support group would be a good first step to getting some kind of life.

You do something to attract the attention of someone unsavory, and you know that what you are doing is going to potentially attract the attention of someone unsavory but you do it anyways because you’re curious if it actually will. And when it does, you end up getting involved with the unsavory person even though you know you should probably have nothing to do with them, again because you’re curious. You end up getting horribly abused by said person for a good period of time. You finally escape from that relationship. And you meet another person who definitely seems sketchy and potentially dangerous. But you’re intrigued by them and they offer to comfort you from the abuse you suffered, and basically offer a way to distract you from the pain. So you get involved with them. And you very soon realize you have gotten yourself into yet ANOTHER horribly abusive situation. Yet for some reason you can’t cut it off with this person. You even call them to come 
over at times, even though you know it will end in you getting abused. Do you see how I ended up hating myself? This isn’t even taking into account at times physically enjoying the abuse, because I really know you can’t control that. But seriously, just look at how many points in that story I was a complete idiot, and got myself into the bad situation. I literally set myself up for what happened to me. How could I not be angry with myself? How can I forgive myself?"
176020299,To yell at people. I am _PERSON_. I’m a string vampire. The ceiling is saying hi. _PERSON_ says a nap is good for you just don’t break shitt.
176020300,"They are in general thoughts like ‘‘i’ll never do it’’ or ill never recover…I also am trying hardly to concentrate on the info around me, I think quite a lot on it. But I have lowering of the energy too so I cant even move. Those worried thoughts are so intense, that it hurts, yeap… I find that I close myself in my head, maybe its a reason… But I am worried from this, cause I have this since kid…"
176020301,Maybe Good Rx will have coupons and discounts available for this medication at your pharmacy . I’m not sure I get mines free because of my insurance but it’s something to look into.
176020302,hot diggity damn !! good !!
176020303,Thanks. Im sorry you lost your mum already. Thanks for your support…
176020304,When I was switching it was a nightmare trying to get the GP to read the psych notes when things changed so I could go to the pharmacy to get my new doses. Does your pdoc give you the prescriptions?
176020305,It may not have been psychosis. Feeling disconnected is a sign of disassociation. What were you experiencing _AT_MENTION_?
176020306,_AT_MENTION_ I wish you all the luck but it seems you already have it lol maybe I need some of your luck
176020307,I still get symptoms every now and then. And I just press on one of my playlists. I have celtic punk with flogging _NAME_ dropkick murphys and real _NAME_’s. Pop punk with fall out boy panic at the disco and new found glory. Last punk the Ramones the clash and misfits. I tried to explain to none mentally ill people that the loud ruckus music makes me feel better. I also listen to grunge
176020308,What do you eat?
176020309,I wouldn’t lower your meds. It is not worth it. Your just going to get symptomatic and then the doctor will have to raise them again. Why do you want to lower them anyway???
176020310,I’m about 80 lbs. over my ideal weight. The ap’s played a major role in this.
176020311,"Smart plan!! I use to cook elaborate, healthy and gourmet meals. I even made my own ketchup and mayonnaise! Since I’ve been struggling, it’s REALLY hard for me to follow a recipe. This is a GOOD plan. When I’m feeling clear-minded and able, I can do the cooking! It will help! Thanks! And glad you will be okay! Hang in there!"
176020312,I found staying away from caffeine and creating a nice personal kind of heaven where you can chill really helps.
176020313,I wish I could have an able account but I worked until my upper thirties. I’m happy for you that you can do it.
176020314,I want people to stop hating people and if I could kill myself or be killed to reduce _USER_ID_ I would do it. But I’m afraid of ending up in hell and that’s why I am afraid to kill myself. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.
174346881,"For people suffering from thought/speech disorders: you may want to supplement with vitamin D2 as people with schizophrenia are known to have a vitamin D deficiency. Purely anecdotal, but I took an RDA dose of vitamin D2 with oil 10 hours ago and the effects on thought/speech are still pronounced, something I have never experienced on any of the meds."

176020323,"I was 160.2 lbs. yesterday. Today, I am at 158.4 lbs. So, I’m down 2 lbs. in one day!! Yay! I have completely cut cookies out of my life. And I think that is going to make the difference in my weight from now on. I was eating almost half my caloric quota in sugar before now. I think it’s going to make a big difference in my health. Kind of like when I cut diet pop out of my diet."
174346887,"So I haven’t done any t’ai ji for nine days now, but today I went through moves 1-40 without the video. I really need to practice with the video and make the effort to do so. It means setting it up, and like anything where I have to prepare in anyway, I can never bring myself to do it. I am always looking for things I can do with minimum effort, such are my negative symptoms. But at least I did some t’ai ji today and I’m going to try and do some every day again from now on. Thank you."

176020327,Wanted to add: I understand their fear. It is logical after all that has happened.
176020328,"make a list. Tidy up when you do something messy. It’s not easy friend but it’s doable. If you see something that needs doing that you need done. Put it on list. Basics. Toilet, shower, kitchen. You can do your little things there too. It’s not hard. Write down or someone else to write down what needs doing and do it. Cleaners can be used to some hard work. I wouldn’t say drown em but I’d say please…what I can’t do!"
176020329,"I am terrified of the dentist. Having that fear I know is there only makes it worse. What I mean is when I was a kid I went to the dentist every 6 months and occassionally something was drilled and even pulled, had braces, but now that I am 31, I have sensitive spots all in my mouth, I blame all the drugs I did in my 20’s, I’m damn lucky I even have teeth lol. Now I’m scared of some scrapy thingy hitting a nerve. UGHHHH I need to get over it though."
176020330,That’s my situation right now.
176020331,I drink wine on a regular basis. But in moderation. I never forget what I’ve done or get sick and it doesn’t interfere with my life. If you can’t drink in moderation best not to drink. Also I don’t know but if you are taking any benzos then best to stay off it. That can be dangerous.

176020334,"Hi _AT_MENTION_. Welcome to the forums. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Volunteer Moderator _PERSON_."

176020343,"Sex releases dopamine. Allegedly. My question is, since scizophrenia is an ilness characterized by the excess dopamine can having sex worsen my condition? Does it worsen yours?"
176020344,"Yes fairly sure as I took neuropsychopharmacology. Risperidone is one of those with the total blockade. (Well not as much as the typical APs but still almost total) I have no idea what you are referring to about receptor side effects No med permanently blocks anything though, if you go off an AP it will eventually leave your bloodstream and the dopamine channels will become unblocked. If you link me to where you saw this maybe I could figure out what you’re talking about??"
176020345,_AT_MENTION_ I think _AT_MENTION_ had mentioned something about using a grip or posted a picture with it and that gave me the idea. And wow! Sounds like you’ll be really busy with the coasters. Do you buy ur paintings from a store or online?
176020346,"I think that sounds great, is that a support group? Oh no worries, I’m ok, I have happy moments, it’s not all bad, I guess I should say I’m never satisfied rather than say I’m not happy, maybe that’s more to the point."
176020347,"In fact i somatize so bad in the evenings, that my body gets very low in energy… I cant move much then. But i am fed up. Probably its the case, cause my thinking is ill still. So i decided to just say “stop” to this torturing thinking… In fact, i did it today and it worked a bit… I really should stop feeling my brain in my head and just be in my zombie land in my head… Ill hope ill suceed the coming days too… But its a pity i wasted 20 years in this . My thinking will need time to recover after twenty years of _NAME_ land… At least now i know its an illness, i am on meds who lessen a bit my fears, but i guess now its up to me to recover this mind… But i am old… i am 37 years old and just the madness behind me… Lots of isolation and loneliness too. But i’ll continue trying. What do you think on this “stop” strategy? I didnt find nothing better tbh… Thinking more and more as possible helps but i try its not way too much either… In a way, now i try to balance my thinkin
g… The meds never did this… And because of this, it was very painful emotionally and physically too. I also go out a bit more, but i walk with my delusions still. But whatever, lets fight Who else was a big loner because of his illness too? Ill hope that 37 years old are still nice years…but yes, its a pity all this wasted time… Lets hope for the best now.

176020358,"reddit r/CoronavirusFOS - Olympia is getting apocalyptic. 69 votes and 20 comments so far on Reddit ""I work in Capitol Mall, in Olympia WA. Today was nuts, let alone the emptiness of a huge mall seeming apocalyptic: -people are stealing toilet paper from the bathrooms. -they are busting open the dispensers. -they are stealing hand sanitizer from stores and also busting open the sanitizer dispensers around the mall and taking out the bags. -there are people wearing paper towel masks taped to their face -there was a woman I’m 99.9% sure had the virus in my store, she was sweaty and dry coughing, after she left the store with her son and husband, she was having trouble breathing, she collapsed in front of _PERSON_ Cheese and her husband helped carry her out. No one wanted to touch her. My store called security and all they could do/want to do is look at her sitting in one of the pay massage chairs getting her sweat and coughs all over it. After she left I told security, I demanded they get someone 
to wipe off all those chairs NOW. I had to go back into my store, I don’t know if the chairs got wiped down, an hour later I saw all three chairs filled by an older couple and young girl. Wtf. I’m getting kinda scared here. -I was told by several people that there ain’t any toilet paper in the city. This is not being reported. Why haven’t they closed the mall?

176020423,No I don’t remember.

176020429,"I took off all my clothes and went naked into the living room. I would lay naked in bed, if a male came in i stayed under the sheets if it was a woman i would stand up. I also jerked off by the window with buildings on the other side. One nurse came inside the bathroom while i was peeing ( they arent allowed to do that, are they?) she saw my ding dong. Some of them seemed to like it while others “pretended” to be like “nono this is strictly forbidden” but in reality did not care that much."

176020434,"I do like to think it is that , something where our change in thinking and doing can rescue us from psychosis. i still think it is a disease too, an alarm call from our bodies to change some ways. i cant speak for others necessarily but i speak for myself. Although there are diseases where too much damage over time, or too acute damage, is done and it is TOO late , I hope that is not the case for me."

I assume ignoring them hasnt worked since its been going on for years. anything the voices say is meaningless. this sorta stuff is like do it yourself CBT"
174346916,"What’s your idea of recovery? I think recovery means different things to different people. For me I’ve already recovered from positive symptoms. I have no paranoia or delusions or hallucinations. The next step in my recovery is the negative symptoms. I’m already 60 % better. But my attention and memory could get better. I want to go on to have a family, a successful job and a house."
176020446,Probably not the same thing - but thats why i changed my name to _NAME_. It used to piss me off with the connatatoins on it that would make me sound thick. I also came out as Bi-Sexual to my twin Brother as well. He just replied “do what you gotta do mate”. lol. Ive always been more comfortable around gay fellas - rather then woman anyway lol.

176020457,I tried orthomolecular therapy instead of my prescribed meds. And I relapsed. I’m stable on antipsychotics now and it’s safe to say I won’t b trying alternative meds again. I was taking high dose methionine with vitamin b6

174346914,Which med did you feel better with?
176020461,"It made me drowsy and dopey when I took 1000mg, had to have a long nap. So I’ll be taking it at night instead. It really does provide an excellent, upbeat mood. Less social anxiety as well. I fit in well at a little get together and had no problems socially. I am taking it for the social effects so I am pleased so far. Will update with how it feels in a week or so."
176020462,"You could be right. I was, or at least felt very much like, a social outcast in high school. I spent most of my time alone in the forest, trying to figure myself out or just being angry at the world Maybe being alone didn’t cause it, but it probably was an early sign of psychosis"
176020463,"Internet itself is like Ebola when it comes to your privacy and your personal data. Smartphones is an upgraded version to that. Now you might say: ""I’ve nothing to hide so let them spy on me"" Fine… Maybe you don’t care. But I don’t think that’s a good outlook on it, since all your activity, your passwords, your emails, all your communications, the places you go, is stored on somebody’s servers forever. Also your smartphone camera, and microphone can be hijacked by agencies without any warrant. Even you aren’t on any watchlist? I still don’t feel comfortable with it. Take an example this forum. People with sufficient access rights (usually administrator/moderator) can read your private messages on this forum. How cool is that? So imagine people on the other end can spy on you in similar manner, since I’ve mentioned already, you no longer own your information once it’s stored on whoever’s server."

For not choosing kindness. For rejecting me because of my disability. I want people to feel responsible that I’ve died. I don’t want my close ones to feel this way, but I want people, everyone who is able-bodied, to feel responsible that I’ve died without love."

176020483,"Concerning memory of time or the notion I’ve been living longer than my age I remember when I first panicked it was back in 97 and I woke up one morning exponentially smarter than I was when I went to bed the evening before. I started finding meaning in a lot of things (and not just my personal associated meaning, I confirmed those understandings afterwards) Like Stairway to Heaven never made any sense to me but that morning I somehow instantly knew it was addressing the metaphysical theory that marijuana produces a stronger connection to ‘god’ I knew that ‘Talking Heads’ wasn’t a reference to strawmen serving only as image for the true politicians but rather it was addressing telepathy; ironically the album I was staring at when I made this connection was titled ‘Stop Making Sense.’ I had not previous studies in quantum or _NAME_ physics so I was under the impression that I had somehow began channeling from some external disembodied mind. But Then I wondered, what if I lived right 
up to my sixties, died, lost memory but retained knowledge of what I had learned and then reentered my body back in 97 with that new information. In such a scenario you would have a diorama mostly comprised of automatons, almost like a Disney exhibit. As you pass certain check points during our time frame we get shift from diorama to diorama progressing onwards into old age. We might get to a point where in we ‘fail’, like failing in a video game and having to start from a previous save point. In games each proceeding play through is going to be easier because you’ll have more experience and know, at least in subliminal memory, what to expect. Also there may be long periods of down time before the diorama is fired back up again and we get reintroduced to pick up from our last checkpoint. If such then this is either some strange game which we won’t be allowed to finish until we make it to a goal age and die of natural causes the only mercy being that we get better at the game because of retaining knowl
edge even if not memory. Or We might be doing this to ourselves as some form of experiment; living a completely different life outside the diorama that we forget when resubmerged again."
174346920,This is exactly the type of behavior that makes people scared of schizophrenic people. You seriously need to seek help before you hurt that person and end up in jail. Telling people your sz makes you hurt people is despicable. Take responsibility for your actions and behavior.
174346915,"Everyone functions differently with sz, and you will be fine as long as you take care of yourself and take your meds. No shame in getting help. I personally don’t have sz. I have a severe form of depression called psychotic depression. I tend to go on long periods of remission because of my condition. The first step is to get an accurate diagnosis.

174346930,"This research aim primary to prove that there is a chemical factor (substance) that is the cause of all that is diagnosed and classified under the category of symptoms of sz It seeks to erase the existence of the psychological theory that says that it is a symptoms of mental illness that arose from early childhood and that grew and exploded the moment the onset of Sz in the third decade of life And these symptoms related historical causes represented in scenarios / dialogue details of past events memories of the person’s autobiography and his outlook towards oneself,others,the life and beyond …etc This means,the chemical substance creates all symptoms immediately in the human being or even the animal ,and does not need years to show its effect, nor the details of the psychological story as the psychological theory assumes Consequently,any symptom that you classified as a symptoms of schizophrenia (whatever it is called) in relation to the research ,it is merely the result of the effect of a che
mical substance BUT see how we put the knot in the front of the saw,when we determine the nature of the sz nature as the hallucinations in complete isolation / independence from all symptoms ,where as the hallucination forming the actual existential symptoms for the condition be called sz So,we challenge all chemicals in our human nature or in the materialist world to create the existential symptom of the thing called ""hallucinations of schizophrenia "" Because,the hallucinations is not created “chemically” and does not destroyed “medically”,rather it is created from impending nothingness (Zero) ,and its chronological life ends with the death of the human host and we know,the human beings are unable to diagnosing the hallucination or knowing what is its nature ,or creating it ,curing it…etc becuse it is not from our natural world !!

176020497,"I am new here and am in my first year of taking antipsychotics. My doctors started me on Invega after I wouldn’t take pills because I believed that they were trying to poison me. I was on 156mg of Invega but I was getting a lot of muscle spasms and I was sleeping so much. My Psychiatrist switched me to 117mg and I am doing pretty good on it. I feel I am on the cusp of being able to be active again, but with this dose most days I feel so unmotivated and extremely tired. I sleep 12 hours or more. While some days I wake up at a decent time. I dunno…I just don’t want to sleep my life away. So we are trying 75 mg this coming month. I was wondering if anyone is on the 75mg invega sustenna shot and how are they doing? I’m a little nervous as I don’t want my symptoms to return. My family and I really went through a lot during my last manic episodes. I’ve alerted my family of the coming dose change and told them to watch me carefully like what I say and how I act. When I was manic I was running 
everywhere even inside and I wandered all throughout the woods, through town and on the side of the highway. Without getting into more details…lol I want to be more active and motivated as I want to attend school again. Please let me know how you guys are doing on 75mg Invega Sustenna."

176020500,I think our illness experiences are similar. I have a voice that calls himself Satan and talks and acts like the devil himself. Do you have anything similar?
176020501,"I can relate to the feeling. It’s a terrible feeling, and not much helps it. I do hope you feel better soon"
174346929,"Only if able to control those, negative symptoms can be improved. Another option is adding things to your current risperdal to improve negative symptoms but in that too mild positive symptoms can appear. These things include omega 3, tyrosine etc. In this too need to self control as it can quickly cause anger, anxiety etc. But not as severe like ablify as you still on rsiperdal."
176020502,I’m glad you’re doing so well! It’s great that you were able to get treated so young. Now you really have a strong foundation for recovery!
176020503,I blame myself for my mental illness and related problems. It was 100% drug induced. Karma for being a bad kid

174346927,"I was helped by such a system and my life has indeed turned from tragedy to possibility. On the day of arrest by the police, they told me “let this day be the worst day of your life”. I was very fortunate I had kind and compassionate police, crown prosecutor and judge. Through my crime, I also met my current psychiatrist. They all had a huge role to play in where I am today. Perhaps one day, I would be able to reveal myself to the world with the support of all the people in my life. I hope my story from insanity to working professional will one day inspire many others, especially people with schizophrenia and help spread the love and kindness I desperately needed on the darkest days of my life to the rest of the world."

Ready to drop procyclidine now as the jerking movements were from the Levomepromozine I was taking as a sleeping aid Just a mess.

176020534,My shrink says to his interns that it’s an art. It really is. You start somewhere and move through whilst looking for signs. It’s not rocket science and it’s hit or miss but a good shrink will get an idea about you and what works… Other than that I agree. You just have to try and start somewhere. That is what makes it hard.

Maybe sometimes I should not feel unique but should try to socialize."

She says her sociopath diagnosis is wrong that she is actually manic depressive instead and she doesn’t need medicine for it. She brought her childhood into it too. I felt so overwhelmed listening to her. I felt that all of it was fabrication. I felt she was trying to illicit sympathy in order to get me back on her side so she could start getting money and cigarettes from me again. I feel so guilty thinking the worst of my own child but I have no choice. Everyone has been trying to get me to see her for what she is for years and I’m finally starting to see it.

Most studies to date have been conducted in naturalistic settings in which the outcome may have been mediated by factors such as poor adherence and substance abuse. We compared the effects of high vs low childhood trauma exposure on the treatment response over 24 months in 78 patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders who received standardised treatment with a long acting injectable antipsychotic. Compared to the low childhood trauma group (n = 37), the high childhood trauma group (n = 41) received higher doses of antipsychotic medication and were less likely to achieve remission. When age, sex and cannabis use were controlled for, patients with high levels 
of childhood trauma had a slower treatment response for positive and disorganized symptom domains, although differences did not differ significantly at 24 months. While there were no differences in functional outcomes, self-rated quality of life was the domain that most clearly differentiated the high and low childhood trauma groups. High childhood trauma exposure was associated with lower quality of life scores at baseline, a lesser degree of improvement with treatment, and lower quality of life scores at 24 months."

176020713,I avoid ibuprofen and NSAIDs as much as possible. Instead I have found the supplement MSM to be very helpful with inflammation. I also almost totally avoid lactose and egg yolks which I seem to be allergic to. I take calcium citrate to get more calcium in my diet since I avoid dairy. Also lately I noticed that eating a very low sodium and relatively low protein diet makes me feel better after I developed high liver enzymes about a month ago while eating a rather keto diet. Another thing that seems to help my inflammation is if I avoid taking my Risperdal in the evening and take it during the day instead. Not sure why this makes a difference but it seems to really help.

176020765,Do you think your speech became impaired after becoming mentally ill?
176020766,"Well, probably because you’re advocating violence when you say you wish he got beat up more. Non violence here, if that’s what you’re talking about."
176020767,"I was quoting you, but that was, near to, my experience also. However, at least with regards to the (Western) self, it is argued to be the result of an internal conversation by a number of authors. E.g. _PERSON_ points out that children’s early nurdlings (he uses a different word) that become quiet “thought” later in life, are thought by the child to be heard by someone. He demonstrates this by putting nurdling children in rooms with children who do not speak the child’s language. The child then ceases to nurdle on. This, he claims, is demonstration that children’s self-narrating nurdlings, and later human thoughts, are not entirely self-addressed but rather a conversation someone he refers to as a (intra-psychic) helper. _PERSON_’s Other is opaque but I think similarly for _PERSON_ the symbolic self is created in comversation with another in the heart. _PERSON_ claims that when we talk to someone else, a real or imagined second person, there is always also a third person listening in t
he wings of stage of our heart (my phrase) a “super-addressee” (his term). If there were no such third person then when the second person of our conversation does not understand, then since meaning is created in communication, there would only be miscommunication, and we would lose sight of our own meaning. But we subconsciously believe that someone else, who understands us perfectly, is listening in. _NAME_ claims that it is only through the vocal gesture that humans can hear themselves from the point of view of others, since otherwise they would need a mirror or audience. We can hear our speech, and we hear it as if someone else said it, which allows us, by internalizing a “generalized other,” to identify with the first person of our self narrative. _PERSON_ incidentally claims that European languages have this third person somehow built in to the language (or culture) but that in Japanese “I” (the first person pronoun) only ever means “you for you.” _NAME_ in “Others in Mind” argues pre
tty much the same thing, that the self is created in “negotiation” with “others in mind.” _NAME_’s “impartial spectator” (and perhaps “invisible hand”) is not specifically linguistic but subsequent theorists have suggested that the “split” we create in ourselves when evaluating our own behaviour can be interpreted in a conversational/linguistic way. _PERSON_ is all about “hearing oneself speak” and the effect that this has on us and Western culture. His book “The post card” is a parody of the internal narrative, converted into a series of (I think self addressed) love postcards (as in love letters). The dualism that we think inheres in the linguistic sign is not really a dualism but a temporal deferring or simply a taking it in turns to speak and then, with the ear of the other, hear. _PERSON_’s very short paper "" A Note Upon the ‘Mystic Writing-Pad’ (the name of a child’s toy, nothing mystical exactly) uses the analogy of writing notes and then erasing them, as the mech
anism of consciousness. _PERSON_ in a nutshell. There are many more eg. _PERSON_ “The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity,” mentioned previously. Bruner “Life as Narrative,” Gottshall “The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human” (not yet purchased). _PERSON_ “Time and Narrative” (i have yet to get through it). The first book I read was _NAME_ “Narratie and the Self.” _PERSON_ is now a musician, I think. I don’t think that this is the only way we construct self though. We also see self in the mirror at least when we are young (as _PERSON_ argues famously) and I think that the Japanese continue to identify with their imagined/visual self, which it is possible to imagine even without an audience or mirror. E.g. see “Video _USER_ID_.” _PERSON_’s “devil” is hidden in the depths of sight, rather than as interlocutor. When I was psychotic I seemed to discover that I was thinking to someone nasty (or nastily) but it was no devil. It was rather someone far more familiar but th
e nature of the conversation made the conversation extremely distasteful, to say the least."

I have BP1 w/ psychosis, schizotypal, and GAD. I suffer really bad deadening affects from my meds but I need them to live life better than I was. Either that or the MI has just totally changed and limited me. According to my nurse people change after mental illness so I have to accept myself. Accepting the down time to rejuvenate is nice to hear. That’s why I’m here nobody else understands what it’s like. Thanks. Hope you have a good day."

174346999,I was relieved because it explained so much of what was going on with me
174346997,"My voices tell me that the connection they use to communicate with me is inherently flawed. Specifically it means that I sometimes hear several synonyms for a particular word almost at the same time, or that I.can’t receive some particular practical information. Some others I struggle to describe. Generally voices agree that I have elements of schizophrenia, but it is only part of the method used for connection , and that my brain being altered does not imply that there is no entities behind the voices. +++ One voice mocks me for trying to get rid of it, and gets angry when I look at women or get drunk or tried to smoke. Others usually quietly disappear when I start hysterical and beg them to leave. Those usually try to comfort me telling that it will be fine in the end."

But that doesn’t preclude development of a drug in the future that can restore synaptogenesis. Some foods may even increase synaptogenesis. PubMed Central (PMC) A Nutrient Combination that Can Affect Synapse Formation Brain neurons form synapses throughout the life span. This process is initiated by neuronal depolarization, however the numbers of synapses thus formed depend on brain levels of three key nutrients—uridine, the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, and choline....

But I guess people do change over time. I’m not even sure I need an anti-psychotic. Maybe 2mgs of risperdal for a little while and then nothing at all. Im just tired of the bs. My issue is now substance use moreso than schizophrenia. I dont even think I have schizophrenia anymore, its gone like it went away. People with fixed delusions or hallucinations yeah they need meds. I went off them for a year and was coaxed back into the system when they called it Bipolar disorder. So it was Bipolar and then they could just call it a little manic, then a year later they called it schizophrenia. My psychiatrist is lying about my issues and the whole system is freaking messing me up. My issue is now substance use, not even that serious. But I contacted a rehab, and I’m going to get things set straight. I dont want to be on meds if i dont need th
em, and at the same time I dont even freaking know what to call anything I experience, because its all under some clusterfx system that makes no sense. I feel pushed to get this SSI too. Its something nice to depend on, my parents act like this will be a hand out. I am trying to become financially independent and they wont do a damn thing to support this effort constantly demeaning me. I want to get the f out of this situation, and away from the controlling stuff. I cant stand the system, I am tired of leaving voicemails and not getting through to anyone at the office for help. I’m up all night drinking coffee cuz f this. I dont have schizophrenia, could’ve been PTSD or a breakdown. But they created this disease by the sexual assault and abuse that happened AFTER I attempted suicide, right after they were forcing me to take risperdal every day. I DONT FEEL HEARD. I DONT FEEL LISTENED TO. IM TIRED OF THIS."

176020952,That’s what I hear when I’m told I’m wrong for getting angry at my daughter when her bad attitude started the fight. Is SHE going to apologize for laying on the floor directly where my feet would be if I were sitting while my feet were up and I was taking a nap and then screaming at me and berating me for not watching what I was doing? Nope. _PERSON_ her daddy came to her rescue when i yelled back. That’s like lying in the d a m n driveway behind a car you know is about to move. She is eighteen.
176020953,I think being single feels really nice when you just got out of a bad relationship. You’re like dang finally its over and im free!!

Yes I still have pain but it’s different now. Now it’s bearable and doesn’t trigger me. If you are experiencing so much pain I would encourage you to ask your pdoc about a good long trial of Cymbalta. Why suffer if you don’t have to. Good luck. p.s. it works good for depression too"

Also I see mentally disabled ppl work in university, they seemed happy and once a mentally disabled girl spoke to me in the cafeteria and asked me what’s my favorite sandwich.

I also had a thing for RTS games for years, but the BFME type game stop being made on consoles. Recently I bought a gaming laptop, and I ended up selling it as I did not use it enough.

176020987,"Comparison is the thief of joy! Don’t do it, unless you want to be depressed. Make your own life better by understanding yourself and your needs, Identify what you love and do it. Forget everyone else, as it is only you living your life anyway. Financial success isn’t necessarily happiness. It is merely the measure by which a capitalist society measures itself, and have you looked around lately? Everyone is increasingly depressed and isolated working as wage slaves. If you are jealous of that then so be it. I could understand a lack of having your own children or a loving partner more so than financial success, but attachment is a source of unhappiness anyway."

He is in touch with medical workers because he writes software for data collection for hospitals. So schizophrenia is not a risk factor for covid19 mortality according to the data. He’s sending me the studies right now and I will forward them if I can. I asked him to find some research on the safety of the vaccines also. So I hope to hear back on that soon.

176021031,"As some of you know, I am working currently as a day stocker for a grocery store. But as of late, I am doing quite unwell. My schizophrenia is acting up, along with depression and other stressful issues. Some of you may remember when I said I was going to get a castration recently; I have plenty of thoughts of nocous considerations. Suicide, harming myself, and other difficult things is what I’ve been served lately. Unfortunately, I cut myself on Monday, and while I have not done it since, it is still unnerving to think about. My plan of restitution, needless to say, has not gone in my favor or liking. And this brings me to the issue of work. It is inseparable to my poor mental health. The stress is getting to me, which I fear may not go away if I improve rapidly. But we are working on that by increasing my risperdal dosage, which has helped nominally, but still has helped. And my parents are really discouraged to get me hospitalized due to some “bad” experiences by people they know. I’m in 
such a pickle as I am expected to still work 3-4 days a week. Its something that has been on my mind, and hopefully I’ll get a medical leave, but I don’t think my parents are big on that."

176021036,Oh Xanax. Good luck.
176021037,The problem with psychiatrists is that they haven’t taken the medicine they’re prescribing to others. I’ll take my 20 years of experience vs a dr any day when making choices for myself. I do think it’s extremely important to get the dr’s view to so that you can be as well informed as possible
176021038,Yes I will be convinced then.

174347046,"I don’t take only clozapine, I also take risperidone and an antidepressant (agomelatine). These 3 help me lowering my voices volume, feel less depressed and sleep 9 to 10 hours. They also help me focus on college and avoid me feeling less motivated to school chores. That last thing ruined me 2 years on college. I wasn’t always with this meds."
176021048,"Seconding the clubhouse idea. My old psych nurse really pushed me to attend my local one but stubborn me resisted. I really think it could be a good thing for me now so I’m way more open to the idea. Do you like bowling? From what I hear, bowling leagues can be pretty accepting. Something else I’ve been meaning to look into."

It doesnt help that i have EUPD traits as well as Sz."
176021057,I agree. You should try to get a new therapist. Hopefully you can find a good one who can help you through this. Don?t give up on finding one. You might need to see a few to find the one who is just right for you.
176021058,"Anxiety, fingernails are ravaged, can’t get thoughts of past failings out of my head. Hurting myself over and over with thoughts I can’t control. They burst like sparks inside my head, have to actively fight them. Gets tiring. I just don’t believe it’s real. Everything is just a light show, and shadow puppets. I’m having a hard time convincing myself. Don’t like that. Still believe I’m a dimensional entity stuck in a human form. I don’t know if I’ll ever get over that. Zyprexa has helped my voices immensely. I still get them but they’re a lot less intense. I’m happy with that. So that’s something. I’m med compliant. The duality is funny to me. I can be simultaneously a god, and the worst consciousness to ever exist, by my own standards and volition. It’s grandeur and self loathing. Need to figure a way out of the thought patterns, constant _NAME_ regulation of thoughts, a filter and screen. Exhausting. Keep my strength up, keep fighting, don’t folly, don’t waver. Tha

174347048,"Before my illness in college back in 2011, I had over 200 Facebook friends, most of them “fake”. I now have zero friends, and 1 acquaintance now. I figure that one friend I have now is the only true friend I had. I figured he moved on or something. Maybe rumors or some ????. He’s really busy with work and life and I’m busy with my struggles. I really don’t trust anybody outside my circle of family members anymore…not after the past life memories of betrayal. We barely talk anymore or see each other. I think he blew me off a few times and it bothers me. I don’t like that. But he’s the only friend that stuck with me with the illness. I respect and care about him for that. I blew a lot of people off too. It’s my fault. But I also figure there are a few girls that like me if I gave them the time of day. I don’t think isolation bothers me that much anymore. I have had friends, albeit late in life. My dad is a total hermit so maybe it is genetic. He said he had friends growing up and 
doesn’t need them anymore. I think schizophrenia changed me for the worse. How do I deal with isolation? I self-medicate. Not really helpful, but it’s the truth. I’m looking into getting out more. Maybe go to a library or coffee shop with a laptop and study or read a book."
176021059,I didnt notice any big changes in losing weight. Maybe just mainting it. I dont have the best diet…i eat a lot of unhealthy stuff still. Being vegan will definitely help with your weight though especially if you include exercise.
176021060,"Hmm. It’s really up to you. I once saw dead bodies and the bathtub and for some reason fell in there. I ended up passing out for some undisclosed amount of time. I woke up and I remember choking on some water from the shower(this wasn’t on previously), but my body made me get up. I never had to wear earphones. But despite me going through all of this, I was still happier than I was when I was feeling really bored. Way happier. I don’t suffer from paranoia much though. I just react to what happens to me. It’s interesting that APs help your OCD get better"

176021063,Same as I ve been doing but also meet a disabled girl once a week for socialising for both of us . I want to loose a couple of kg and eat less pasta and bread. I want colour my hair bright red. I want a new tattoo. Hopefully save some money if I can. I would like to have $1000 in savings in case of emergencies. I have no savings now but am not in debt.

Don’t be too proud to say that you are only coming out with a hundred bucks in profit a month and that is motivating you to move. Perhaps, they will give you some more money so they can be worry free and keep you close to them. Living anywhere takes work to clean and maintain, so moving won’t alleviate it that much. My two cents…"

176021070,"Life is tiring for everyone, even for the rich. Life itself is tiring- that’s just how it is. Even if someone doesn’t have schizophrenia, they could be dealing with family problems, domestic abuse, children not behaving, death of a family member, bullying, physical disability or disease like cancer, etc… People say that life is a series of trials, and many religions have various theories as to why we suffer. I thought that rich people didn’t have problems. I thought that being rich solved everything. But the family who owns Samsung has various members who have inherited a neurological disability so they must suffer from poor health for the rest of their lives. That alone is just a lot of suffering. We just have to cherish the good and learn from the bad. That’s basically it."
174347054,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Omega-3 fatty acids ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Fan, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Fan, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain, behavior, and immunity, Apr 2020 15 Our previous study showed that metabolic abnormalities reduced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and deteriorated cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia. Inflammation may play a key role in this process. Omega-3 fatty acids have been documented to ameliorate inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may be of value in enhancing BDNF levels and improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia with metabolic syndrome (MetS). We recruited 80 patients with both schizophrenia and MetS who received long-term olanzapine monotherapy. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis f
actor-alpha (TNF-?). The patients were randomly assigned to the OMG-3 group (n=40) or the placebo group (n=40). Of the 80 patients who consented to the study, 72 completed this 12-week RCT. The primary outcome was the changes from baseline to 12 weeks in clinical characteristics and the levels of BDNF, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-?. There was a significant correlation between omega-3 fatty acid treatment and enhanced delayed memory factor in the RBANS assessment (Fgroup×time=6.82; df=1, 66; P=0.01) when the patients completed this study. Along with cognitive improvement, omega-3 fatty acids enhanced BDNF (Fgroup×time=4.93; df=1, 66; P=0.03) and reduced CRP (Fgroup×time=17.11; df=1, 66; P<0.01), IL-6 (Fgroup×time=9.71; df=1, 66; P<0.004) and TNF-? (Fgroup×time=6.71; df=1, 66; P=0.012) levels after 12 weeks of treatment. The changes in BDNF levels are negatively correlated with the changes in TNF-? levels (r=-0.37, P=0.03) but not with the changes in CRP and IL-6 levels. Our findings provide suggestive evidence that 
omega-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects on cognitive function in patients with MetS, which is paralleled by enhanced BDNF levels."

176021092,"_NAME_ wrote a book about how some cultures are more socially hierarchical than others, and the hierarchical culture is reflected in the structure of their language. E.g. Japanese and Korean languages have a lot of words for ‘Honorable Sir’ etc whereas English is a relatively unhierarchical language. _PERSON_ also referred to something call ‘the power distance’, which is the average difference in hierarchy levels across the whole population. In the USA the power distance is zero, and in the UK (a notoriously class ridden society) the power distance is 5. I’m proud to say as an Irishman that Ireland ranks second only to the USA in having the lowest average power distance, at zero point five. This explains why social standing is perceived as more important in some cultures than others."

There are genetic factors such as copy number variance and single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to various neurotransmitters,voltage gated calcium channels and the immune system. There are neurochemical issues such as excecive dopamine activity (specifically D2R over activity) in the striatum, others say excess dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway and to little in the mesocortical pathway. prenatal infections are another. brain inflammation is another thing. There is also often an abnormally thin cortex and enlarged ventricles in schizophrenia patients. then there is drug use. And of course there are social/environmental factors such as being raised by people with sz and low economic status."

To be honest I blanked out and lost time. I don’t remember any of the things they said I did. This all ended at 18 and I had aftercare till 19.

If your hearing voices - just tell them to piss off, they will probably get worse and louder, but with practice they will go away. Its about developing a “second brain” that filters the crap coming from the first one. And most importantly - Learn to manage your anxiety. Thats the biggest killer for the voices cropping up. Do some breathing exercises - or if they are too bad, shove some banging tunes on your headphones."

My body dysmorphia is probably considered more delusional because of my SZA dx, but over the years, I’ve REALLY fluctuated weight-wise (thanks meds), and so when I would blow up fast, I would stay convinced that the weight was only noticeable to me, like I was still thin. Obviously it hurt when i would get asked about the ''baby’s"" due date or my clothes wouldn’t fit or tear etc… and when I lose the weight, I’m convinced I haven’t. In fact, I’ve gone WAY the other way and feel like I must be WAY heavier than I think/feel/see. It’s way more than just weight though. Buckle up lol. About 50% of the time, I have a God complex lol, I think/feel/see a 9.5 that could destroy the world with my knockout looks and personality.

I’ve looked through a bunch of pictures of myself the past few days and thought “Holy ????, how did I think this was a good picture of me?!?” Like, I’m seriously seeing a haggard, disfigured looking woman, and I’m EMBARRASSED for wearing sexy clothes or feeling like when men look a little longer at me they’re not thinking “WOW!” (what God-complex me thinks), they’re thinking “What the ?????!? ” I also flip back and forth on whether my husband exists. One of my big 3, my main psychotic delusions. 1. I think I’m dead/dying violently. 2. I think my husband is imaginary, or a split personality of mine. 3. I think I’m actually WAY crazier/sicker than I am, maybe even in an institution, and everyone is in on it and knows but me. So I’m filing this one under possible body dysmorphia and delusion… Maybe I AM him. Maybe HEATHER is a split personality.

Reflexes still pretty good and find it’s mostly eyesight failing me.

Schizophrenia vs ADHD - Catatonic Stillness Demonstration Search above term in youtube as unable to give link here. The distinguishing difference between schizo and bipolar (apart from type 1) negative symptoms is the lack of positive ones like hallucination, delusions etc. So if negative symptoms are prominent without any positive its likely not schizo. Negative symptoms might be attributed to the cognitive impairment brought by the bipolar."

176021279,"I want to feel certain that I am sane, but I’ve been experiencing this bizarre occurrence for a many months now: People are literally repeating my inward thoughts to me. Based on everything I’ve read, it would appear to be a delusion. However I’ve had irrefutably uncanny experiences where people have almost verbatim repeated my inward dialogue. It feels as if people somehow have access to my mind. I’ve experienced people using my own logic/thoughts against me. Also when I think the most obscure things, I somehow witness some type of manifestation of it, either A) someone will repeat it to me shortly after, or B) I will come across it somehow in like an advertisement online, or a social media post specifically relating to this very peculiar thing I’ve thought. I know these can dismissed as mere coincidence but the frequency of it feels uncanny. I’ve also been experiencing a lot of “synchronicities”, also sometimes the things I think about happen (I think about a person I haven’t he
ard from in ages and call or text shortly after). I have been seeing a psychiatrist for a year now, but still no diagnosis. The last time I asked him if thinks I have any condition, his response was that he feels my symptoms are a little too mild to suggest anything severe… Because of this I’m increasingly feeling frustrated that I’m unable to get any answers or help for my situation. Another strange thing is that my a few days before my last visit to the psychiatrist (which was early this month) I was reading in forums about people with my experience. Somebody mentioned something about it relating to Divine Providence and and spirituality and whatnot. The bizarre thing is during my appointment with the psychiatrist, after I discussed with him my experiences, he literally repeated what I had read about. He said to me he believes in Divine Providence and that sometimes God can intervene in the universe and things can happen etc etc. Initially I felt comforted that he wasn’t telling me I’m crazy, but 
in retrospect I feel like: why didn’t he give me actual medical/scientific advice??? Why is he talking to me about spirituality and why did he literally repeat what had read about a short while before? (divine providence and all that) It’s almost like he’d seen it in my mind. I feel a little trapped in that it’s as if I don’t get real perspectives from people when I seek help or advice, even professionals. People literally tell me what I have thought to myself when I ask questions. I strangely feel like things are an outward expression of my own mind. Have any of you experienced this, and how have you over come it?"
176021280,"I have no right to complain because I don’t always understand me, myself."
176021281,"If I were well enough to be in public, I’d just have a neutral expression. I’m not the type that can sport a smile for no reason. I’d try to have decent posture though, that seems to color interactions pretty substantially. Predatory types pick on those with weak posture, but tend to not engage with people who look like they know what they’re doing. Club or workmates, ideally try to keep your mind pure, no intrusive thoughts, and just go with the conversational flow. Try not to dominate it too hard, or talk about yourself too much. But schizophrenics are at a huge disadvantage since their minds are so noisy, and it feels like everyone’s reading their mind anyways. Really messed up situation."

176021287,If everyone is keeping you in the dark that is 100% classic delusion. Surely the live feed is easily found if it was real Delusions usually can never be proven because there not real. I hope you overcome it one day. I was a prophet on ‘secret’ missions. So I was ‘keeping people in the dark’. I wasn’t allowed to tell people what I was doing. Just up your meds till your delusion mellows with psychiatrists advice of course

176021293,At 18 I had a bad break but recovered and eventually got married and had a child without taking medication. Later on the stress of job re-organization gave me another bad break. I was given a terrible pdoc that I was finally able to fire. I was a mess but all on my own I found the greatest pdoc in all my sordid tales. After two years I was able to pull myself together and get another job. And that one lasted until I retired. My husband betrayed me but I forgave him and took him back. I paid off his credit card debt and I thought we would live happily ever after. Then he screwed himself by divorcing me and losing all the retirement I had saved for 40 years. My son recently got engaged. They may move in with me because I have a four bedroom house I paid for all by myself with no help from my _PERSON_. I just thank God that he had mercy on me.

On the other hand, a lot of people with SZ feels isolated in company with certain people who can’t understand how they feel and their different ways of thinking. They get angry or hurt, and use the word “normie” to feel that they at least belong to someone - the group of non-normies.

The great thing is that once you cook it you can store it in the fridge with some of the juice used to steam it/cook it. It keeps for at least a week or so so you don’t have to cook it often. Then, you can eat them on some bread/buns that you like. Or, if you don’t make them into patties, you could eat it on a platter with gravy and some fresh vegetables – or maybe a baked sweet potato? I love sweet potatoes. Otherwise, in the morning I do a good cereal or I eat a snack/something filling. Just make sure you enjoy whatever you eat.

The latter position presupposes the impossibility of divine revelation. As such, it is a denial of the validity of faith and most theistic traditions, except for deism. LaVeyan Satanism teaches self-deification. A version of egotheism exists in the pagan cult of Antinous, where it is known as homotheosis."

Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically. “Maybe,” the farmer replied. The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbors exclaimed. “Maybe,” replied the old man. The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy for his misfortune. “Maybe,” answered the farmer. The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him by. T

174347137,"Ppl always ignore negative symptoms bcz they don’t have them and they blame it on the person as a result. Even if they have SZ. A minority of SZs get negative symptoms, that’s why its ignored. My psy told me all the SZ story since 1950 when pdrs saw that not all SZ are able to function after taking antipsychotics: Negative symptoms are less responsive to medication, and are the most difficult to treat."

176021436,Although they closed our playground because of covid we still had a good time playing out on the grass. And when we all got too hot it was back to my house to trash the place and see what was breakable lol. It seems as though my storage ottoman was a good investment because my grandson loved playing with it the best. He even figured out how to get in it. Dad had to help him get out though. We got special little cups for them to get water from the water cooler. That was my granddaughter’s favorite thing. And she really likes my stair stepper too. I can’t wait till next weekend when hopefully I’ll get to see them again.
174347141,"Where I live, the demographics are split roughly a third each between “Asian”, “Black” and “White” according to Wikipedia. My father’s ethnic group makes up around 2% and is largely concentrated in my locality, but they don’t in general work for the hospital. The nurses and care co-ordinators are mostly “Black” and the doctors and psychiatrists mostly “White”, this is not necessarily wrong, but there must be fewer than 100 people with my particular ethnic mix, and I find it hard to get the support I need from both the nurses and care co-ordinators and the doctors and psychiatrists. I feel nobody understands me."

And then my 2 year old goes on a destructive streak yesterday and well you know the end. I may post the after though. I didn’t get any sleep last night so right now I’m gulping down some very strong coffee and trying to force myself to eat something so I can take my ultra mega vitamins with caffeine so I can get started. I was so tired this morning that I missed church… But I really didn’t feel well because my house wasn’t clean. That may be why I couldn’t sleep… Because I knew I had to do stuff when I woke up! LOL

You are not a bad person, we it is a mental disorder that affects our health and abilities in more ways than one. It was not your choice to develop schizophrenia. Nobody chooses to have a mental illness. With that said, take it in stride and use it as a learning experience to better prepare yourself for the future. You can still live a happy and fulfilling life, it is not too late. Maybe being employed just isn’t on the cards right now, but that does not make you useless or inept. Try to remain positive. You put yourself out there attempted something that many of us find difficult. I think you should go back and try for a little longer. Unless your mind is set, then try to remain positive. Like, keep in mind you’ve been stable, life is not all that bad, you made an effort to try. It is better than not having tri

176021502,"No, that’s the last resort and it’s my psychiatrist’s plan when I get back from CA if the voices are bad on the trip, and so far they’ve been pretty bad. This is the last time I’m going to try a new medicine, I’m tired of the stress it causes me. In the past 50% of the times I tried new medicine it resulted in a very negative side effect, one drug made me want to amputate myself and another resulted in me planning a suicide and trying to get ahold of a gun the day after taking the first pill. I’m sure there’s a chance it will work, so I’ll stay optimistic, but after this I’m just gonna fend for myself on 10mg of largely ineffective Zyprexa. I’d be anti-medicine if my symptoms weren’t so severe. I hope these doctors know I’m really trying."

Really anoying, it feels like ???? without my smokes. Cigarettes make me feel better. The only thing I’ll do without smoking is laying in my bed the whole day. It surely has an effect on my behaviour. I have nothing left to live for. I’m done with life. I hope I get terminally ill because of smoking. But bad news are, my father smokes and drinks heavily and he is still not dead. If I’m unlucky even the smokes can not kill me like I want to."

But everything before that since the big bang is the same. I’m always schizophrenic and have the same family and the same events fold out until 2015-2016. It’s annoying. According to some guy, wormholes are on the same worldline/timeline, which could explain why I keep reliving my life over and over again in the same reality. It’s multi-faceted in my opinion: We live in a sim that is in a loop my mind has gone through wormholes and escaped and gone back in time the universe might bounce back exactly the same. I don’t know. Anyways, that’s what’s going on with me. I would like to experience a completely different life and never come back to this reality again. I don’t think it’s possible at all."

So i began wondering, if there was anything else antipsychotic but available in a more natural form like vitamine c. I stumbled upon _PERSON_ megavitamine theory and vitamin b3 dependency for many schizophrenics / malvarians, and then this website where they are considered doubtful or so. Are there any studies available on nutritional / supplemental support of schizophrenia lowering both positive and negative symptoms? Would be pleased to read more about that and any personal experiences on that topic. Best wishes and health StableOne"

But you won’t catch me disclosing much these days to anyone really, as I learnt the hard way that you can lose people in your life if you’re not careful I have been doing this since I was 16/17 years old.

Im sorry you had such a bad experience and they arent helpful."
176021594,"It’s just as I suspected. I’ve been studying classical piano for the last 14 and a half years and largely failing miserably at it because I wasn’t raised on classical music, I never listened to it my whole life, and I’ve always been a rocker. Don’t get me wrong. I love classical piano today but that’s not what I’ve been about my whole life. So, Ive decided to shift my focus a bit and study some rock songs along with my usual classical pieces and I’m finding that the rock songs are a lot easier and more natural for me to play. I feel that all that classical study has been great preparation. For instance, right now, I’m playing _NAME_ All Along the Watch Tower."

176021611,Doctors are extremely cautious about prescribing scheduled drugs like klonopin or other benzos. Should they be more sympathetic to your situation? Absolutely. But you asking them for klonopin if they already said no is not going to change their minds. If anything it will make them less likely to prescribe it in the future if they think you are drug seeking.
176021612,"This really stood out for me _AT_MENTION_. I’m obsessed with being right irl and putting things “right” when I’ve been offended by someone invalidating my feelings, being passive aggressive or aggressive. I simply can’t let it go & it triggers my psychotic symptoms and my imaginary conversations big time… I’m arguing the “right” path days later. I hate it.

176021696,My gp emailed a reference to the hospital with a psych ward one time so that they made sure they had a bed ready for me that day then from there they got me psychiatrist and reference to the mental health community team im in Australia so dont know if its different where you are but here letting them know your coming will help you get a bed easier. Have also been in an emergency room because of symptoms they looked after me quite well in the local hospital until a bed opened up in the hospital with the psyc ward.

176021704,you mean they really put you in there because of your talk on stalking? There’s got to be more than that.
176021705,Before diagnosis I read lots. Three books a week sometimes. After psychosis I have struggled to read. These days I try to read everyday and make time before bed to read. It’s still an enjoyable thing to me just my concentration can waver. Reading everyday makes it easier and I try to read a chapter a day if possible.

176021713,"I shave my head bald from time to time. Either grow a small beard or shave it off. For clothing I’m lacking money to get what I would like to wear. My clothes are a shameful mix up from sales. Just last week I ordered some military boots, the new german sports pant as used from the military they use in the Bundeswehr Army where I have served twice, and two camo t-shirts. I only bought the clothes because the pants are 9.99€ and the shirts are lesser than 8€ for each. My biggest problem is, that I’m so heavy overweight, that I don’t fit in the clothes they sell in the city at the stores. So I’m always searching for deals and they has to be my size. What I kind of disslike nowadays, in germany they started selling pants which get thinner the further the legs go down. I can’t fit in them. And I don’t like to wear tight clothes. I’m not a dildo and don’t wear a condome."

176021715,"I’ve just had my second episode of psychosis. My first was in February 20.20. I was on antipsychotics until September of that year when I came off of them following a reduction. I remained on 50mg of sertraline. I then had a stressful period at work, with family and my partner from January onwards. I then reduced my sertraline to 25mg and had a relapse of psychosis within two weeks of this. I suffered from delusions but no hallucinations, for nearly six weeks, and was placed on Olanzapine at the start of this time. And have only just now realised the delusions were not real. During this time I was off of work, but was caring for myself. As I had those months off of antipsychotics. I now want to work my way back to a reduction and stop them again, but stay on sertraline and reduce stress this time. Does anyone think this is possible?"

176021718,"I’m on Invega as well. I feel depressed a lot. What helps me is watching Netflix, talking to people on Facebook messenger, sitting in the sun. Sometimes I find myself just stuck in my own head. Thinking “what am I gonna do for the rest of my life”. Usually when that happens I go for a walk. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it’s just a sad walk. It’s just important to remember that things are going to be different now that you have a disease. The good part is you’ll be on medication and won’t have to deal with the fear of voices or hallucinations."
174347206,Do you think they will approve it easily if the company betters the coating process? I’m on olanzapine and mostly my only side effect is weight gain. This would be a good med for me
176021719,No and I think it would riun the whole point of checking. As I would see and automatically would know. This is strange a coin in the shower and look a like cannabis leaves all over the floor. It freaks me out after a sleepless night when I am especially vulnerable

176021722,My low self-esteem and confidence is making me very depressed. It’s painful to meet people. Just going out the door and throwing out garbage is making me nervous.

176021729,"For what it’s worth. I only think and remember writing this portion of the letter. Not sure why, but it could be that I wrote controversial stuff. I don’t know what I wrote. I had a friend, _NAME_ (former best friend), tell me in a past life that I was either Horselover Fat or that girl (horse something) from Netflix. I don’t know or remember. I’m sort of guessing. I just remember horse. Some people were convinced I was the literal reincarnation of _NAME_ too, which I deny and say I never was… There’s a lot of similarities between me and _PERSON_. I even think I helped MiTHC get picked up by Amazon as opposed to Netflix because Amazon Video would have gone bankrupt imo…controversial stuff. But I’ve been pretty much insane for eternity – even while time traveling. Like I had no control over being sent and where. Like it was unstoppable and inter-dimensional I’m guessing. Maybe I was invisible sometimes too. I don’t know. I’m sharing this because I’m convinced I split off th
e universe (watch the video) and was the computer programmer _PERSON_ talked about in the letter. It’s possible I even wrote Man in the High Castle in a parallel life. It’s possible he wrote it first, I don’t know or recall. I have a photographic memory and might be in a causal loop. Hence the Horselover Fat connection. It’s like the chicken and egg metaphor or w/e. What came first? It all makes sense and plays back to Augustish 2011 when I had my spiritual experience and God told me I’m stuck in the Matrix. It goes back in time or a past life where we created our own universe or simulation – something a type 4-5 civilization would do or be able to do. I don’t know what or who runs the simulation anymore. It could be the real God in the Bible or something more sinister like an ET/AI species. Thank you."

We had a picnic lunch and talked and looked at the chickens and roosters near us. The weather was perfect; it was great to be in the mountains and the forest again. It’s been too long since I’ve been there. Then some kid led us and some other families on a trail and took us where a few goats and cows were. We got to pet them. I never thought goats liked to be petted but these goats loved to be scratched; they were in ecstasy. We all had a good time. I talked with everybody and put my two cents in on issues whether they liked it or not. But mostly I was in fine form, if you can make a tablefull of adults laugh it feels good."

It can’t be a coincidence that every black person in this city reacts to me but then i don’t get this reaction from any other type of people anywhere else. This is what makes me believe. Because I did _PERSON_ in 2012 when I was arrested and made a big scene. And everyone made claims like I was god and I WAS really delusional at the time but it’s like god was guiding me, guiding us. Guiding everything. It seemed too real."

If your withdrawal is like mine there is a silver lining. At the end of the three months I felt like a new man for a month (before starting the next reduction). After the last reduction I felt great for about a month then my symptoms came back so we went back up to 5mg. But I lost 20kg and was doing really well on it.

176021814,I’ve found this place to be good to my mental health overall. It’s a nice crowd and ultimately peer counselling really does help those in need. And your one of those to continue that by helping out those who need it…Makes it all worthwhile.

176021818,"I agree with shellys12. Two weeks is still early and 20 mg is a low dose. I am on Lexapro, it started helping in the first two weeks, but didn’t reach maximum effectiveness until after a month. You have plenty of room to increase your dose if you need to, but give it a bit of time at the 20 mg dose to see if you need it. It’s always good to take the lowest effective dose."

176021820,At the time my GP was being really difficult with me. Saying I needed to change surgeries because I wasn’t in his catchment area and that he had budgets to worry about - but simultaneously he was happy to see my parents who lived 3 miles away (where I was close by) - so he clearly just didn’t want to treat me. So I didn’t want to make problems worse. It was when I saw a GP more often (at a different surgery) that I trusted that I asked about it.

It’s sad that people can’t just be who they are with love, peace and freedom. I live with someone right now who believes that transgender people are sick and it makes me sick to have to listen to it. This whole area that I live in is anit-pride and anit-ethnicity and I can’t wait to get out of here and get some color back into my life. The new town I’m moving to is so full of diversity and people expressing themselves and I can’t wait to go enjoy it and be myself for the first time in 20 years."

176021843,"I think I see myself as what the society sees us. The dangerous, criminal-like “nature” of our illness. I have a degenerative disease. There’s no way that I’m going to hit someone with my weakened arm or leg or anything. _AT_MENTION_ I don’t have proof- maybe the proof is the news and the comments on the Internet. _AT_MENTION_ I’ve been abused as a child so I have a very poor self-image. I’ll stick around. I don’t really have anyone. Everytime someone says nice things about me it just goes right through the ear. I just don’t believe any nice things people say about me. They say that I’ve helped them, and that I’m an emphathetic, nice person…but who cares if the society will always think you are dangerous based on your illness? I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to do anything…I just want to drown in sorrow and pretend that I don’t exist in this world. But I understand that you’re trying to make me feel better, and thank you for doing that. I was taught to never list
en to the good things and always criticize myself. I was abused when I get questions wrong in my test and got yelled at by my mom if I didn’t do things right. I was abused at school when I did something wrong or when I couldn’t control my emotions. Nothing was ever right at the beginning of my birth. I was basically a mistake and I was supposed to be just abused I guess."

It would take more than a single molecule based drug to holistically benefit the ecosystem of bacterial populations that complex. What diets could help this?

174347262,"PubMed Central (PMC) Multidimensional Connectomics and Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia: Linking... Schizophrenia is a very complex syndrome that involves widespread brain multi-dysconnectivity. Neural circuits within specific brain regions and their links to corresponding regions are abnormal in the illness. Theoretical models of dysconnectivity... Hyperglutamatergia may be a distinct feature of TRS and be differentiated from treatment-responsive disease since greater abnormalities in glutamate function have been found in those patients with TRS while maintaining a relatively normal and intact dopamine function. Neuroimaging measures using fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) as a PET radiotracer found a higher level of striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in patients with schizophrenia who responded to treatment vs. those patients with TRS who had equivalent striatal dopamine levels found in healthy controls ( 72 ). The same group later utilized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(1H-MRS) imaging in TRS to examine glutamate changes that may be specific to antipsychotic treatment-resistance ( 73 ). This was the first group to report high glutamate and glutamine levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in TRS as compared to those with schizophrenia in remission, and another group has since replicated this finding ( 74 ). Increased concentrations of glutamate found in the ACC that are specific to TRS are consistent with both the glutamate hyperfunction and the NMDA receptor hypofunction hypotheses of schizophrenia. Normally, glutamate is responsible for regulating inhibitory tone in the brain by binding to NMDA receptors on _USER_ID_ interneurons. The structural mechanism that may cause NMDA receptor hypofunction in TRS can lead to disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and excitatory pathways by the understimulation of inhibitory GABA interneurons ( 75 ). The downstream effect can then cause an increase in glutamate release from presynaptic pyramidal neurons and binding to ?-amino-3-hy
droxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors and may be a compensatory effect of the NMDA blockade ( 75 – 78 ). The hyperglutamatergic state can initiate calcium influx and cellular toxicity which, over time, can be detrimental to neuronal networks ( 79 ). In treatment-resistant disease, excitatory inputs from pyramidal neurons within the ACC circuit could also be disinhibited, leading to increased glutamate efflux and generating symptoms that fail to respond to D2-blocking medications. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may be responsible for the widespread brain abnormalities and severity of symptoms that are found in TRS."

176021937,"Don’t read me if i bother, please… My plan was never to stop my meds, no… I don’t go in this direction, so you are wrong on this… I just wanted to know if somebody was relieved on his physical ill sensations by his ap?.. If its possible, but it seems that this will be hard here… Cause my brain doesn’t work properly and I guess its hard to recover on the brain, the thinking etc…"
176021938,"I have trouble coming up with things to say since antipsychotics. I prefer to text. It’s sad, I don’t want to talk to my long distance friends because I’m afraid I won’t have anything to say. Its keeping me from being social and trying to make friends."

176021941,"Who says it’s public record? I’m actually not even sure what that entails or what it means. I’m excused from jury duty for life starting about 6 years ago. It doesn’t sound right that anyone can find that out about me, it seems it would be information that would be kept confidential. It’s no ones business. I would call the court anonymously and ask them these questions and ask who exactly has access to the information and doublecheck to see who could find out if you gave them a diagnosis. It shouldn’t be a be a big deal or public spectacle; the court has a million people to choose from to serve jury duty, they don’t need to wreck anyone’s life or reputation."
174347275,"So glutamate levels may also be too high in schizophrenics? And broccoli may reduce glutamate levels by converting it to glutathione? Is this maybe why adhd meds are bad for schizophrenia if they increase glutamate, or one reason for being bad for scz?"
176021942,"_AT_MENTION_ , I’ve never heard of Risperidone causing acromegaly. But, I know that acromegaly is caused by a non cancerous tumor of the pituitary gland in the brain. This tumor then stimulates too much production of growth hormone, or GH, which causes enlargement of body parts such as the face, hands and feet. Risperidone can definitely cause prolactin levels to increase."
176021943,"The same thing happened to me. It really hurts to go through that process. When I got mine, they had me recover on the maternity floor. I don’t want that to happen to you."

176021945,"I know some days will be horrible, but remember this cliche saying “it will pass” everything in our lives will pass nothing is forever.

Feel those emotions but never stay there forever or your life will pass you by. You can do this! Hope this helps."

174347264,My psychiatrist said the same! There is no meds for negative symptoms like apathy and avolition. It sucks but at least we got ride of positive symptoms. Right?

176021951,I don’t want a family. I think it is achievable though but takes a lot of hard work and self care so that you feel able to care for a kid too. I have all sorts of fears regarding family and so I’m better off as a person who has had psychosis to just avoid it all together. Tbh even if I wasn’t ill I would still not want a family But it is possible for you

174347268,I take Invega Sustenna. On 156 mg I had no symptom relief. It took raising to 234 mg to see results. My negatives were severe until my doctor added Abilify 10 mg a day.

176021985,_AT_MENTION_ I was the golden child in my family too. I was the favorite. Good grades and good in sports. Then I started doing drugs and alcohol recreationally.

I also sometimes had the feeling that someone is talking about me behind my back but it never went as far as you describe. There are cases when people go to great lengths to exploit someone. The victim of exploitation must be someone with shovels full of money for that. Otherwise it is not worth this effort.

I am losing patience so much as I’m sick of trying to be nice and accept everything . All he does is smoke and pace and that’s his life. I have convinced myself that the mediation isn’t right and he can only function at a basic level. I don’t know how to handle things any longer. Walk away and he has no one .

176022069,"At first,in the case, if you belief that the Sz condition in its basic nature is a mental illness ! It is understood that ,the disease or illness is a change in the basic inherited structure (component ),which in turn leads to the functional disorder which in turn lead to the inner suffering or the symptoms that can be diagnosed by the external observer Therefore,in order to say the sz is mental illness,you should know the main change which occurs in the basic structure of the phenomenon that you call it the mind (mental) ? This means that,before the searching for a change in shape of the organic brain,size …etc at first ,you should prove that there is a change in the mind’s structure itself !! What is the change that occurs in the mind’s structure and precedes the functional disorder /symptoms outputs and causes both of them ? In sums,what is the mind and the change that has been occurred in its basic structure and causing the disorder /symptoms ?"

176022072,yea that sucks… if you really feel like you are a danger to others or yourself i’d talk about it with your pdoc and see if you have to be admitted to the psych ward to get better. But maybe you can wait it out a bit till your meds fully kick in. But only you can decide that really huh… you know if it’s too bothersome or not. how often does it happen?
176022073,Yes thanks _AT_MENTION_ I’ll be careful.
176022074,I do exercise when nothing works
176022075,It sounds more like you want to yell at people than discuss anything.
176022076,I used to think I was the devil then I turned later in deeper psychosis as the right hand man for Jesus…you are delusional and need to see a psychiatrist so he can fix your meds if you are on meds.
176022077,That’s correct. I agree
174347298,"I am on clozaril for ten years now and i still feel hungry all the time, never went away really, i just eat a lot of fruit and veg excercise every day and dont eat any junk food, it is really hard to avoid junk food but your weight can be managed!"
176022078,"I guess we have to, I wouldn’t do it right away so they can have a open mind. Get started dating first so they get to see who you really are and then tell when the time feels right in the right manner. Like it’s not a big problem and that you’re managing the situation."
176022079,First episode I came off within 9 months. I think once you’ve had a second episode it’s 3 to 5 years if not life.

176022081,"I take a whole bunch of meds, so it’s hard to tell sometimes which ones aid and which ones hinder me. But I’d say my most helpful is Prolixin. At 2.5mg 2-3 times a day, most if not all my positives are gone. I also take Latuda, lithium, Prozac, prazosin and remeron. Latuda for the psychosis, lithium for mood, Prozac for depression, prazosin for ptsd, and remeron for sleep."
176022082,"Yeah, pretty close. My skin became super sensitive to even very light touch. Everything hurt. My joints felt swollen but they weren’t. They were very stiff. My muscles ached all the time. I couldn’t sit still for very long or I would get stiff. Sleeping the whole night in the same position made it almost impossible to get up on my own the next morning. I can recommend a really good cbd oil lotion with magnesium and menthol that really helps my fibro pain if you’re interested."
176022083,I’m also sleeping less even on a higher dose of seroquel lmao
176022084,"No real support here, see the doc twice a year, thats about it"
176022085,i’m glad i don’t have to take the lithium anymore. It is like only med i ever had to take that i’m really grossed out with. It tasted weird when i had to take it and then it messed up my thyroid too.
174347302,"My nurse told me that the way ive been talking makes her think whats happening rn is less schizophrenia (though it plays a significant role nonetheless) and more ‘grief over the dx’. I have a thought like “did i fake it”? Normal brain: no. Schizophrenic brain: “hell yeah i faked it! See im not sick and to prove it to ‘normal brain’ im going to obsessively think over this for the next couple years or so” …??? Sz is a ?????, and a mother ??????? Now I have to try and remember this. Will I? Probably not. In fact _PERSON_ willing to bet ill even forget to tell myself to forget. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, change comes naturally for me. I hate that thats as true as it is. Its my reality."

176022090,Did you have trouble exercising while on geodon because of the qtc prolongation
176022091,Not saying I have intent or anything. Just a thought Ive been hung up on a while.
176022092,Call up your pdoc and tell them.
176022093,Nah. Drugs take a while to kick in and work effectively. I would say it could easily take two weeks before they are working. Often even longer (4 or 5 weeks)
176022094,Please give me some information about which antipsychotic has been proven to have the least amount of side effects! Also generally what AP does everybody take And why?and how does it help them in everyday life! Thank you!
176022095,"I definitely need to exercise more . A not too long distance walk makes my lower back hurt. The GP has said it’s weight and being very sedentary that’s the issue. That yes-it will hurt more at first but over the long run being more mobile will make it better. Now we come to the tricky part. I only feel safe,due to my poor sense of direction and possible mild agoraphobia walking in an area about 1000 steps from my flat and back again ."

174347297,"Most important thing managing negative symptoms is to have daily schedules and following them strictly whether feel like to do or not. For example go to sleep at fixed time and get out of bed at fixed time on morning using alarm clock. Not nap during day time, even if nap use alarm clock to limit your nap less than to 20 minutes or suitable so that it won’t create insomnia at night. Bath at least once every two days. Workout or exercise at least twice or once a week. These kind of small small daily schedules make and follow it strictly this help to fight against the negative symptoms. If there is any energy issues then its worth to rule out any thyroid issues, vitamin d , b12 deficiencies."

176022098,I agree with all three

174347310,"You must answer the first question not any one ,because the answer is related to yourself While the objective question that is supposed to be asked is; Is there anyone of you who knew why the sz had happened to him ? Why there is no cure from schizophrenia ? There are many causal factors related the nature of sz itself ; 1- Sz itself,is higher in rank and development than the phenomena which they are called the human self,the mind or the human conscious state 2- The internal logic of the phenomena,processes and events of the sz condition is radically differs about the logic of the disorder / processes that occur in the classical diseases which be studied and known by human medicine 3-All forms of changes,mutations,disorders and symptoms which related sz is differs from A to Z about what occurs in all types of diseases 4-Sz itself,is more smarter than the human reasoning which is used to identify the disease and its causes 5-The sz has higher intelligence than the content of all casual / therapeutic 
theories that have been said / written about sz throughout hundred years ago 6-No pathogen of any known disease can do what the sz’s pathogen does in the chemical and mental nature of the human host,at least the sz’s pathogen is a conscious pathogen ,it is more developed in structure / function than the mentality of the human being ! 7- the pathogen has a properties of structure and function that make it much stronger that the human host during the bilateral conflicts that occur between them during all waking hours 8-When you underestimate the capabilities of the sz’s pathogen and think that it mere an imaginations of things that do not actually exist,the price paid will be the constant complaint that there is no cure for sz ! 9- unexpected ,the capabilities of sz’s pathogen are used with a purpose of demolition,inability,deficiency,incapacitating and failing the mental functions of the host that operate normally ! -Failuar to employ the mental function as desired by the psychological will and achieve 
the personal interests -what distinguishes a person with sz about all people without sz ? Having the inherited / acquired natural abilities to perform any successful mental task that achieves personal interests,however, the intervention processes of the sz’s pathogen with the kinetic paths of mental processes and with their cognitive content causes loss the ability to direct the attention arrow towards the subject that supposed to treat its data mentally in order to carry out successful mental processes that serve the personal’s interest *"

And they begin to drop Faster and faster Pen flying and paper crushing The words out one by one A jumbled flurry Of expression The ugly process Tearing at the white page Filling with black ink Flowing from my head In demonstrative form Falling and falling Til the final breath of life Has been bled from the quill.

There’s thousands, maybe even millions of people in the same boat as you. So for those reasons you aren’t a parasite. The problem isn’t being a parasite. That’s just a matter of opinion. Parasite is just an insult, and not apt to call people who can’t work. The problem, unfortunately, is your family and their attitude. They seem to be very intolerant. It’s unfortunate, but people on disability aren’t parasites. Do I think you could do more than you’re doing? Yes, I do. I think if maybe you tried harder you could do a little more. But I have no idea what that would entail. Off the top of my head I think you could take walks. And with some help and encouragement maybe you could do more. But I think you’re situation is that you were just unlucky to have the family that you do. They have their good qualities of course but 
they are intolerant and ignorant. NOT stupid but they are just uninformed about mental illness. You probably love them and they probably love you in their own way. But they seem uninterested in helping you or understanding you. It’s too bad, it helps to have a supportive family."

For example, I am a 180 pound man and my basal metabolic rate is 1700 calories. That is the proper amount that I eat to maintain my weight. Most people falsely believe 2000 calories is standard.

Last Tuesday I was buying groceries in the Dollar Tree, and I forgot I had a snap card, and I paid for my groceries with cash.

Last night and today I’ve thought a lot about it and even spoke to my parents last night about my theory. Has been on my mind a lot today. The strangest thing just happened, I opened a book on an old book case of my now deceased grandfather, it was a religious book but it was quoting the exact text in the Bible about false prophets. How can that be that coincidental, 6 months ago that would have triggered me, now it doesn’t me as much, but I still find things like that very coincidental and strange. Any thoughts?

174347330,I signed up on social media about 5 years ago. I got flooded with friend requests from all the people I once knew. They were all up to the same stuff. I deleted my facebook page after a month. There were people I’d like to of kept in contact with even if it was only on the internet but there were to many people I wanted nothing to do with. I figured it was in my best interest not to be on there.
176022232,I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . You need to go to the ER if you’re harming yourself and thinking about suicide. It doesn’t matter who doesn’t like it. Your safety is the most important thing here. And i would find another pdoc who takes your symptoms a little more seriously. Suicidal thoughts aren’t just a normal part of life and shouldn’t be ignored.

I hear it takes two years to get comfortable with it. I In 2017 I couldn’t do it. I tried working full time as an aircraft mechanic and I was always late for work. Constantly late. Just couldn’t get out of bed some mornings. In 2018 I worked only three months out of the year but I didn’t really do that much. I had to leave early a couple of times because I forgot to take my meds. Most days I went in and hung around an hour or two and left but still logged 8 hours everyday. They were paying me really well though. The few days I had to work a whole day I did. I tried to go back to my aircraft mechanic job but they didn’t need the extra help anymore. I was just an independent contractor for them. I went back to work full time this year on March 16th and I haven’t been late once yet. I didn’t really expect to be able to do it b
ut I have surprised myself. It took a long time to get here. I hope I can continue to cope."
174347335,"Hugs. My husband had a hard time at first understanding my condition. It helped him to read books on the subject.

That one also has a series of blog posts."

I didn’t really talk to her but when we got home she sent me a friend request on FB and regularly likes my posts. I don’t know when the group is meeting up again. It was supposed to be on the 28th last month, but our province went back to not allowing groups that size because cases went back up. But I will definitely see her again.

176022245,"I was never like that until I got to my two dissertations as I majored in History and Sociology. At the time I was very ill, but somehow I managed to sit myself down, and hyper-focus on these two 15,000 word projects, and still do a half decent job of them. Before the psychotic symptoms came about, I used to spend a lot of time in the library, and I would skim through the indexes of every book on a subject we were focusing on, and digest all the relevant information or theory. My work was very original, and that put off some tutors, but in the main it pleased more people than it disappointed These people with ‘student syndrome’ are those going to Uni for the ‘experience’ of living away from their parents, and getting their hands on thousands of pounds to spend on getting messed up - who then realise at the last minute that they actually have to do some studying to justify their existence at the uni. All this was happening around me and I thought it was such a waste. What I did was stay at h
ome with my parents, and drove in each day, and I saved every penny of the loans that I could, and worked like hell in the down time between semesters. Net effect was I left Uni with half a deposit for a flat, and not a damaged liver and ???? grades."

176022260,Exercise has no effect on medication and it doesn’t increase your physiological metabolism. Its your thyroid hormones that controls metabolism. Hypothyrodism is low metabolism and hyperthyrodism is fast metabolism. They are both dangerous. Taking lithium and certain medications can alter thyroid hormones and hence metabolism. Lithium can cause hypothyrodism and indirectly slow metabolism. I have a physio degree.

176022319,Alot. I have the voices of two male police in my head saying constantly the police are going to shot me in the head. Also there is demonic cackling outside my head. I see the hands as black because the police removed my hands and put an evil persons hands there. I feel very angry and homicidal. There’s intrusive thoughts that command me to do stuff or I’ll die which are put in by the police. I can hear in my head what others around me are thinking like telepathic powers. I believe I am being crucified like Jesus but I am more important than Jesus because I know more e.g. about the aerials on the police cars that transmit electromagnetic waves to my electrical brain signature. That’s a fraction of what’s going on

176022321,"What does age matter here? You say she’s not in her twenties anymore, but that has nothing to do with having hook ups. Ultimately it comes down to this, are you living in her home or is she living in yours? I live at home with my folks, and even though I’m 28 I still follow their rules. I live in their home, and as such there is a certain level of respect I try to maintain, because the other option is to live on the streets. She has every right to have sex. You could talk to her about trying to make a compromise about not making loud noises when you have to wake up early, but ultimately its her choice. When we get to a certain age, regardless of what conditions we have preventing us from living on our own, we become guests in are parent’s homes. They are no longer bound by law to provide for us or offer us shelter. If she has demands that you simply cannot meet then I would recommend having her talk to your treatment team about making reasonable goals. The other option is to start making othe

176022327,"It is very common and normal to dissociate a little. People do it if driving to work or doing mundane or repetitive things that are common to that individual. To lose a few hours and not be aware of the time is pretty normal. If you do it all the time then i would be a little worried and mention it to a doctor, however, not losing consciousness so to speak and becoming unaware of “I” is dissociation to the extreme. This happened to me and is called a fugue episode and i was unaware of myself for 3-4 weeks. I wouldn’t worry too much about a few hours of mild dissociation at all. Good luck."

Women get older too though…most get way less critical about looks. I personally wouldnt end a date if a guy is overweight or bald or depressed or… And you dont look bad i think!"
176022330,Plenty of people have had this. It’s been called “solipsism” through out history. Nowadays people bring the whole simulation thing into it. There are certain things and thinking about them will drive you bananas and the meaning of life is one. It’s probably best to leave things like that to philosophers. Concentrate on surviving the day to day stuff. Just my 2 cents.

176022333,"A new draft NICE guideline published today (20 December 2019) on the rehabilitation of adults with complex psychosis and related mental health conditions says they should have access to rehabilitation services in their local area and the use of out-of-area placements limited. The draft guideline says those commissioning services should aim to place people locally and limit the use of out-of-area placements wherever possible, except for people with particularly complex needs. And commissioners should only provide an out-of-area placement after a local placement funding panel has confirmed that the person’s care cannot be provided locally. The draft guideline recommends that when people are placed in out-of-area rehabilitation services, they (and their family or carers) should be told the reasons for this, what steps will be taken to return them to their local area, what support will be provided to help them keep in contact with their family or carers, and the advocacy support available to them. ht

But I’m losing the battle, I don’t clean, but most of my thoughts are focused now on the smallest (and absolutely natural) imperfections around us. One of the reasons I stay most of time in bed is because I can’t stand the slightly uneven floor in the living room.

174347351,"My schizophrenia can make me cry - not at random or inappropriate times, but when it wants to. More precisely, the process controlling the voices seems to be able to control crying as well. The voices have told me in advance that “We’re going to make you cry now” and then I started crying. There were fake/inserted thoughts related to the “reason” that would make me feel sad (I saw an item that “reminded” me (via fake thoughts) of the owner of that item, the good old times, and that she’s now living her own life, while I have the most pointless life ever). But since they were fake thoughts I could not react to them in any way (become sad or cry), and even those fake thoughts weren’t there when I started crying - I had a completely blank mind at the time. Then the voices told me to associate the crying with the sad topic (of the fake thoughts). That was another way for my schizophrenia to mess with me - the voices/fake thoughts have already earlier wanted me to “associate” thing
s, for example that walking equals less torture (which appeared to be true). They’ve said it would impact me badly (in the afterlife) if I associated things that appeared to be related. The voices have told me more than once that “they’re” going to make me cry, and indeed I started to cry - for no reason (other than the process controlling the voices wanted me to), and while my mind was blank."

176022365,probably the thc _USER_ID_. pure cbd does not much at all for me while when i smoke “hemp” flower i end up doing it every day until i get symptomatic. i think its messed up how people actually believe its under 0.3% thc. at first lab test would show 0.2% delta 9 thc and about 0.7thca which is convert to delta 9 thc when heated. now i notice even on the same products the lab results have been changed to being conveniently right under 0.3 total thc right after the fda clarified that its 0.3% total thc and not just delta 9. im sure they are mostly fake labs so they can sell high cbd weed. im surprised its still a grey area. probably because the majority of people think weed is harmless. i dont think cbd is bad but i think faking lab results and selling products with more thc than legally allowed is kinda shady

It sounds like a case of trial and error, try it and see if it helps you. But it seems from what others have said it would be an expensive venture Are you in a living situation where you could grow a few plants? You would have to do your research online, and make sure you were getting seeds that produce high-cbd plants.

I just realized today that I have other options: I could get levers on certain keys, like c or f, instead of a full levered one. That would reduce the cost to 800 dollars, or even use a used one. I’m keeping my eye out for levered harps that are used. I had one person who wanted to send the harp to me but the shipping was too expensive."

I struggled to keep my job. I managed. I hung on. It wasn’t easy. One of the reasons I don’t pop in here as often as I used to is that you are all so young.

176022448,How did the switch go?
176022449,Mate. I still play competitive cricket with poor eyesight and a good bit of learned co-ordination. I learned from endlessly doing it and I’m not too bad. Lot’s is muscle memory and just doing it. Lot’s is mental discipline…that is sadly lacking sometimes but when I can put it together I go all right! Martial arts isn’t so stressful but it does involve some muscle memory. I think you’d be surprised if you tried it. I found it good for my co-ordination. As a child I had troubles with that for sure…

174347377,"I read the story on the dailymail earlier this afternoon. I thought the exact same thing about the negative connotations it portrayed of Schizophrenia, It was disgusting how they portrayed that the killing was down to the Schizophrenia when it totally wasn’t, He was deemed safe to be in public by a psychiatrist just 24 hours before he killed that person so the stabbing wasn’t down to mental illness at all. It is totally sensualised news, This causes _USER_ID_ to people with the illness. Its disgusting.

174347373,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . Get disability and take it easy for awhile until you feel confident enough to go to work. You can be on disability for a year or two and then get a job and still keep your SSDI. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to find work. Just work on getting better now; jobs will always be out there when you’re ready. It’s good to take risks and try working but you don’t want set yourself up for disappointment by trying to take on too much, too quickly. Take it easy (if that’s even possible for someone with schizophrenia, lol) and when you are feeling better then take a calculated risk and slowly prepare yourself for employment by searching the job market and getting an idea what’s out there and maybe fill out a few applications for practice and practice your interview skills by going on an interview or two even if you don’t really want the job you are applying for."

176022489,Homeopathy is magical thinking that is unlikely to cure anything but also unlikely to harm anything except emptying your wallet. Homeopathic “medications” are made by repeated dilutions so that the ingredient is not really in the medication anymore (just the “essence” of it remains). That means there is no active ingredient left to cause any benefit. For instance 30x (on the label) means one molecule of active agent per ocean of water.

176022510,"Thanks _PERSON_, I think there is something to be said for the idea that it comes from a desire for people to care about your life and issues as much as you care about them, a desire to be famous and people to be talking about you, also to know what people really think about you behind your back. It always comes out negative though, which is one of the biggest problems. I’m not saying that there isn’t a bio-chemical component, that it isn’t caused by a malfunction in the brain, but I really do think that our reality begins with our desires and imagination, including the bio-chemistry, which is why I’m hopeful I can heal. Another issue, is that when I experience it, one of my strongest thoughts or desires is to know “how can this be happening?”, which is related to the desire to experience it in the first place, however traumatic that desire may be. I want to know a chain of cause and effect that explains the phenomenon. I don’t really know why I desire to experience it other than to u
nderstand what causes it. It is always negative, it always feels oppressive, at best it is a form of infamy, rather than fame. Perhaps I want to know how I would cope with fame, but I haven’t done anything in my life to be famous for in a positive way, whereas there are plenty of things that I am ashamed of that I have done, and these are the things that people seem to talk about. I think practicing forgiveness, both of myself and others, can help. I have only just started to get into such a practice in a conscious way. I’m not Christian, but I do think that there is much wisdom in the idea. Thank you."

I didn’t trust my mind anymore either and questioned every sound I heard to make sure it was real. I saw a trauma therapist for this, and you’re right, it’s a little different than other traumas. But talking about it repeatedly in a safe space helped to “deactivate” the memory a bit. And learning how to cope. Time helps too. Things are much better now. If you have access to therapy, I recommend looking into it, if you’re open to that. But most importantly, is your psychosis being treated? It was unclear from your post and you said you’re headed into an episode. I hope you’re talking to your treatment team so they can adjust your meds or if you don’t have one, getting yourself to the doctor asap. You don’t 
need anymore trauma. Take care."
176022551,I take lamictal 125 mg in the morning and 125 mg at bedtime.

174347407,"Never tried latuda but im on risperidone myself. I started with pills but changed to injections after. Honestly the first thing i remember when taking risperidone was the constant pacing, but i think that was from the psychosis. Anyways i found the injection form to have way less side effects than the pills. Plus i was able to lower my dose to the lowest one. The other thing i notice is the twitching of the legs and eyes. Doesnt happen often but its noticable when it does. Its not that good for sleep tho, it used to help but slowly i got used to the drowsiness. Im thinking of asking my doc for 5mg of abilify to help a little with the sleep. On abilify my sleep schedule was normal for 3 months. Woke up at 6 in the morn in bed by 9. Anyways hope the new meds work out for you. What dose you gonna be on?"

176022561,"It’s like when we are dreaming, we are hearing things that aren’t really there isn’t it. So the voices we hear with psychosis is kind of like that too, there not really there although they are created by our brain due to some chemical imbalance in our brain.that is what the antipsychotics are trying to re balance in our brains Good luck with ur med adjustment"
176022562,"I told my family dr that I am hearing voices not there and he ignored me. I saw many drs and asked them to refer me to a psychiatrist, they all refused. Here in Canada you can’t see a paychiatrist without another dr’s referral. I think its because healthcare is free here. Even with a dr’s referral you need to wait 1-2 years to see a psychiatrist. They’re like diamonds here."
174347408,i’m successful now i think… i’m doing well on my meds except for negative symptoms but i do feel like it’s success. When i worked i should have been successful but i couldn’t cause of the positive symptoms i was dealing with.

176022567,"Take your meds early, like 5-6pm. I had a hard time waking up in morning when I was taking resperidone. But I’ve switched to invega injections and I’ve been waking up really early now. Without drowsiness."

176022572,It was effective for me but I think Risperdal is more effective from my experience and according to Wikipedia. I was on 80mg for a year but it gave me bad nausea and bad akathisia. You might not get these side effects though.

176022574,Maybe I’m totally off on this. I think there should be some accommodations. The problem is that all people do things differently. You need to do it your and your bosses way. If he does something that doesn’t work for you that’s fine. You have a disability and a way that works for you. I’d figure out what works for you and makes your job more pleasant. It seems when your new autistic or not coworkers want you to do it their way. I don’t think it has to be that way. I don’t know that kinda makes me feel like an inconsiderate prick. Was what I stated inconsiderate? What do you think about the above _AT_MENTION_ ?

I know I’ll go to heaven. I get paranoid a lot. I see my strange IP addresses and different locations. Maybe a mod can explain how it says I’m from a city 30+ miles away from where I’m typing. It changes constantly. Happens on my cell phone too and the advertisements I see. I see more than the normal amount of helicopters in my area. I’ve seen weird wifi names on my wifi and crap. I’m actually surprised what people say on these forums. I’m assume they’re either floridly psychotic or just have no common sense at all. Not to be mean. I try to think before I type. I actually believe most of what I write. People say my reality isn’t based in reality at all. It’s shocking to me. Regarding college, I saw some UFOs in 2016, and they said something about something happening to me in college. I’ll stop there. I just 
cannot figure it out. Maybe I got abducted. It’s a common story. You hear about it all the time. Mine is just really wacky and extremely absurd. I sort of went insane but I’m recovering.

So my son got a free pizza out of the deal. Later in the day she asked me and my ex for money to which we both said no. Then just a few minutes ago she called and asked me if I wanted to go to the casino to which I said no, then she asked why and I said I have no money so she hung up.

As needed if you are going through something traumatic and you need an emergency line of contact to another person to stop yourself from harming yourself or another. In my opinion at least.

As a casual - I work 2-5 hour shifts and that’s the most I can manage due to low stamina (pretty much no sleep). Personally, I’m able to mask my psychotic symptoms at work, I’m just sure not to talk out loud to myself while on duty. I have way more fancy uni qualifications and have had 2 other more high-end professional careers (one was social work) but pubic libraries is where i work these days. What I love about it that my colleagues treat me with kindness & respect. That’s a mood lifter & does my mental health wonders. Plus it’s cheerful work - social work was problem saturated & working exclusively with a deeply negative clientele. I volunteered for 15 months to get good references & eventually got public library work. I have a TAFE qualification (useless in terms of applicable workplace training but cou

Given it is indeed hallucination and not some kind of minor disease or uncomfortable clothes, the following advice may or may not help. I suggest you attempt it when it is the last option you can think of. Some who take celibacy extremely seriously do the following, among other things. When they wash their body they cover their waist and therefore genitals with thin cloth. Then they wash the body relying on touch only to guide them. I understand that celibacy is irrelevant to the question. However, I suspect that tactile hallucinations in privates have some vague relation to the person’s sexuality.

174347449,"I don’t know if your statistic is right or not. Here’s what I have heard for years: Statistics show that people with schizophrenia are no more violent then the rest of the “normal” population. It’s about the same percentage. If this statistic is still valid, the second half of it is that when a schizophrenic becomes violent, it is usually due to three factors or a combination of three factors. Violence by schizophrenics is usually due to not being medicated, because they’re drinking or using drugs or they had a history of violence before they became schizophrenic. In a related statistic, the violence by schizophrenics is usually committed against people they know i.e. family or friends. You can blame it on the media that the general public has the idea that schizophrenics are all dangerous and could snap at any time and attack who is ever near them or that they all commit random violence against innocent random strangers. This misconception is due to the occasional gruesome, bizarre mur
ders that the media reports and sensationalizes and the only time the general public read anything about schizophrenics all they hear is about these rare incidents. So several years ago a young guy with schizophrenia killed a woman sitting on a bus next to him and beheaded her. Something like that is rare but it was really played up in the media and was in the news for weeks. That was an extreme incident that rarely happens but that’s all the general public hears about schizophrenics. It’s the only thing about schizophrenics they are exposed to. It doesn’t make the evening news or it doesn’t go viral that I have been working for the last 35 years or that I baked a perfect pasta, beef, cheese casserole tonight. It’s the rare violent mass shooting committed by someone who might be schizophrenic that the world hears about. And since that is the only thing they hear, it is no surprise that they associate schizophrenics with violence."

The current study examined whether childhood dyspraxia predicted later adult nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders. From a standardized neurological examination performed with children (aged 10-13) at genetic high risk of schizophrenia and controls, several measures of dyspraxia were used to create a scale composed of face/head dyspraxia, oral articulation, ideomotor dyspraxia (clumsiness), and dressing dyspraxia (n = 244). Multinomial logistic regression showed higher scores on the dyspraxia scale predict nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders relative to other psychiatric disorders and no mental illness outcomes, even a
fter controlling for genetic risk, ?2 (4, 244) = 18.61, p < .001. Findings that symptoms of dyspraxia in childhood (reflecting abnormalities spanning functionally distinct brain networks) specifically predict adult nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders are consistent with a theory of abnormal connectivity, and they highlight a marked early-stage vulnerability in the pathophysiology of nonaffective-psychosis-spectrum disorders."

I went to theatre to see Thor when it first came out. I was so afraid, because it was very loud. Also I couldn’t even see kungfu panda 2 because it literally was evil to me. Now I can see TV and enjoy, but the thing that bothers me now is when I am in my room and my parents are watching TV in living room. I hear demons speaking through TV, sometimes it’s better sometimes not. So I usually either put earphones or just come sit in living room because when I sit near TV I don’t hear voices as much.

In that the sense of agency is, furthermore, implicit in the action or thought itself, there is no need, for one to introspectively determine whether or not one is the agent in terms of one’s overall intentional psychology” “Agency, for _PERSON_, is built into our voluntary actions and is not something one decides upon or verifies after the fact. Neither the appeal to intentions to think, nor the notion of a feeling of conscious effort in thinking, is in keeping with our normal phenomenology” I often find myself detached from my own body and natural sense of self. Im thinking about thinking and what thoughts are (the quality, not the content) When im in a good period i rarely ask these questions, i have a nat

Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

176022774,Maybe just find a apartment with nice neighbours and make friends just to keep mind safe on conversation. I dont like to have roommates.
176022775,"When I was sick like I had been poisoned from risperidone, it took me 6 months for it to go away. It took years for the foggy drugged feeling to go away. Maybe less, I was in bad withdrawl for much of it. Dont know how long it will last for you, but what you are describing with risperidone went away eventually for me."
176022776,"Doing better now , first few years were what i call the bad old days!"

176022782,I just quit mine. I am trying to go without. I was only on it for a few months this time but I also find it helpful in taking the edge off. Because it is so hard to get hold of I need to look after the supply I have left for emergencies.
176022783,"This is kind of a side argument, but I recently found that it helps to understand why people do us wrongs. Like recently some guy complained to me at the shop where I work about the prices even though I am just a guy on the floor. So I told myself he must have had a really bad day to bother doing something like that. I mean deep down he must have known that his complaining wouldn’t make a difference. He was just venting at a random employee. I’m not making excuses for him, but appreciating and understanding why it happened made me feel good. I was able to let it go with no hard feelings."
176022784,Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

They have never affected my SZ other than lowering the pain level, which can contribute to stress and ramp up my symptoms. Given how addictive they are, I use them as sparingly as possible as getting hooked on that crap would blow a hole in my recovery from SZ. Got enough trouble in my life without buying more."
176022786,I’m not sure why it helps me so much and not other people. Possibly because I have never consumed fish in my life and still really dont. I have begun to wonder if I did consume the right kind of fish throughout my life would it have prevented the psychosis .

174347469,"Low dopamine is linked to negative symptoms this is why negative symptoms get worse when increase AP dose. Also another major factor is duration of illness. Negative symptoms get worse when this duration increases. If take dopamine and epinephrine boosting things like wellbutrin, strattera, tyrosine etc then negative symptoms can be reduced but it can bring positive symptoms too which need to manage without medication. Omega 3 can improve negative symptoms but it too carries the side effects like said before."

176022826,Another idea is to get admitted to a psych ward of known for good doctors and fully agreeing for treatment they offer and medications they pick. It will take minimum of one month to 3 months but the result will be that you will be put on the meds you will fully function

176022832,"With a c3.5 year age difference and the fact that _NAME_ went to boarding school when I was about 4, I was not really aware of _NAME_’s behaviour being particularly different until he was about 7 or 8. From what I heard from my parents however, from the age of about 4 he started to become more quiet and perhaps withdrawn. _NAME_ was always very shy and quiet, and did not typically join in play with our other brother and me - I think partly because he did not seem to be able to engage in imaginary play, and found it difficult to truly ‘play’ as we did. I also think that _NAME_ had a difficult time in ‘reading’ the emotions or feelings or reactions other people outside of the immediate family. When he was home from boarding school _NAME_ again preferred to spend much of his time alone. _NAME_ could be quite obsessive over certain things- like collecting baseball/ football cards even though he had no interest in playing the sport. As _NAME_ grew to his teenage years he became more socially a
wkward and reclusive.It was around this time that he was badly bullied at boarding school due to not being a ‘normal’ kind of teenage lad. _NAME_ was always very intelligent, and when younger was quite obsessed with facts an figures etc He had no close friends in childhood or his teenage years that I am aware of. That was my sister’s description of me as a child/teenager for the ASD assessment ."

176022834,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ My Mom died from advanced dementia in September.
176022835,Yes you should. Even if you are fine sz wise you still have a problem of sleep walking so u should definitely tell that to your pdoc.
176022836,I never thought of that. I was told I am getting a new doc and am thinking I should try to fake being normal. I dont know how to _USER_ID_ a poll though. Let me try.
176022837,"Good luck, man. I hope you start feeling better soon."

176022842,The thing is that I had everything I want now before my SZ. I was better/smarter than them. I have a degree in physiotherapy which is better paid than them and had a gf before them.

174347473,Shouldn’t the title read “Antipsychotic drugs increases risk of late life Parkinson’s”? …
176022846,Yeah I have prolactin issues. I don’t feel pregnant. I take these drugs with side effects because I don’t want to be psychotic. You have to decide what’s worse being really psychotic or having your nipples a bit enlarged. If you don’t like it you can change to another drug. I don’t think taking your psychiatrist to court is gonna have any good outcomes. Obviously you need to be on meds.

Recording your dreams in a journal upon waking is an excellent tool to study and recall dreams; and enhance your lucidity/mental sharpness. Memory recall has also been a key factor in recovery from my thought-disorder symptoms. Recovering from the hallucinations took more of a chemical- re-sharpening awareness and evolution. Neuroplasticity was introduced to me and I also attempted Neuro-feedback and found almost instant results although a painful and shocking process/hard to explain. Letting go of ideas/concepts can also be painful/traumatic. Neurofeedback would be useful, neuro-plasticity seems a realistic concept.

174347485,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Hyperfocusing Hypothesis: A New Account of Cognitive Dysfunction in Schizophrenia. _PERSON_ Luck, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_ Gold, Schizophrenia bulletin , Jul 2019 18 Impairments in basic cognitive processes such as attention and working memory are commonly observed in people with schizophrenia and are predictive of long-term outcome. In this review, we describe a new theory-the hyperfocusing hypothesis-which provides a unified account of many aspects of impaired cognition in schizophrenia. This hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia involves an abnormally narrow but intense focusing of processing resources. This hyperfocusing impairs the ability of people with schizophrenia to distribute attention among multiple locations, decreases the number of representations that can simultaneously be maintained in working memory, and causes attention to be abnormally captured by irrelevant inputs that share features with active representations. Evidence supporting the hyperfocusing hy
pothesis comes from a variety of laboratory tasks and from both behavioral and electrophysiological measures of processing. In many of these tasks, people with schizophrenia exhibit supranormal effects of task manipulations, which cannot be explained by a generalized cognitive deficit or by nonspecific factors such as reduced motivation or poor task comprehension. In addition, the degree of hyperfocusing in these tasks is often correlated with the degree of impairment in measures of broad cognitive function, which are known to be related to long-term outcome. Thus, the mechanisms underlying hyperfocusing may be a good target for new treatments targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."

176022877,"‘Reversal of Epigenetic Age with Diet and Lifestyle in a Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial’ medrxiv.org 2020.07.07.20148098v1.full.pdf SUMMARY Manipulations to set back biological age and extend lifespan in animal models are well established, and translation to humans has begun. The length of human life makes it impractical to evaluate results by plotting mortality curves, so surrogate markers of age have been suggested and, at present, the best established surrogates are DNA methylation clocks. Herein we report on a randomized, controlled clinicaltrial designed to be a first step in evaluating the effect of a diet and lifestyle intervention on biological age. Compared to participants in the control group (n=20), participants in the treatment group tested an average 3.23 years younger at the end of the eight-week program according to the Horvath DNAmAge clock (p=0.018). Those in the treatment group (n=18) tested an average 1.96 years younger at the end of the program compared to the same individu
als at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066 for within group change). This is the first such trial to demonstrate a potential reversal of biological age. In this study, the intervention was confined to diet and lifestyle changes previously identified as safe to use. The prescribed program included multiple components with documented mechanistic activity on epigenetic pathways, including moderate exercise, breathing exercises for stress, and a diet rich in methyl donor nutrients and polyphenols."

But it wasnt my fault either, I had a terrible past. My decision to fight now is since an year. But I still suffer so much from my false beliefs, the rejection from the others or just their despair about me, that it’s still a hell.

In the beginning of this site there was an accompanying chat room which was moderated and there are still some people that come here that came back in 2004. Lot of people died from then to now. There were no advertisements back then for “supplements” or “vitamins”, the mere discussion of those topics was forbidden. Now its “allowed” to discuss various chemicals masquarading as natural remedies, in fact, there are banner ads for them The thing that fascinates me the most and probably the reason I keep coming back to this old “mine field”, is the fact at this point that is really not discussed or disputed here … Just how many kids they grind in this meat factory, Year Upon Year, Decade Upon Decade … its never satisfied and always uses the same marketing TRICKS over and over AGAIN on the most vulnerable of our species.

176023017,"Sz can be very debilitating. There’s no shame in feeling unable to think about your future. Take it easy on yourself, and try to ignore dumb questions. Get your treatment sorted, it’s the first and most important step. Your brain is young and powerful, don’t doubt yourself. You will get better. Hugs !"
176023018,ah that sounds interesting =)
176023019,"_AT_MENTION_, I think there is a reason alternative medicines stay alternative medicines. It is because people who research treatments have deemed them not viable as treatments. If some of these outlandish treatments actually worked, they would be administered by doctors. I mean you can try it if you want, but I think it is just one of those things you will waste your money on."
176023020,A fun one is the multiples of 9 9 * 2 = 18 : (1+8=9) 9*x|y| 2|18 3|27 4|36 5|45 6|54 7|63 8|72 9|81 10|90 The individual digits all add up to 9… when you roll into the next decimal set… 11*9=99: (9+9=18) 9*12= 108: (10+8=18) This demonstrates something strange in how it treats 10… as it treats it like a single digit number… this pattern continues where the first two digits added to the last = 18 11|
176023021,"I want to be an engineer – work with my hands. Like EE or CE. Preferably CE because I like computers, the pay is higher, and it sounds cooler. You get some more programming. EE is harder, more hardcore physics and theory, and more job prospects but lesser pay. I think. I want to be ‘a man’ ie work with my hands, build things, be self-sufficient, make money. I convinced myself I’m _NAME_ titor so I’m trying to prepare my severely disabled self to take care of myself in the not so distant dystopian future. I don’t think a real company will ever hire me. Maybe a small company or a local one. Maybe I’d have to be an entrepreneur or do a start up. That’s why I like engineering over CS because CS is better for money and jobs and the theory is intense and cool but you don’t learn hands on skills like building houses and fixing cars and building time machines haha."

174347522,Schizophrenia sucks. No way out.
176023026,Coincidence and things like ideas/frames of reference can make things seem fantastic. You shouldn’t be paranoid about it but you should tell your doctor these things. An adjustment with meds may help you out.

176023031,Welcome aboard _AT_MENTION_!
174347533,I do worry about your meds _AT_MENTION_ I hope Clozapine works well. It’s seen as a gold standard here. Just make sure you get blood tests for the first 6 months
176023032,"I’ve gained weight. A lot. He thinks it’s contributing, And thinks I should abstain and see how I feel. I’ve always been under the impression you can’t be really addicted to cannabis, But if you can, I would definitely qualify. I need to lose the weight, but really don’t know how to navigate life without cannabis. It’s really the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I don’t know how to proceed."
176023033,"Well then by definition they wouldn’t be delusions then, right? You don’t believe mine and I don’t believe yours. Let’s keep it at that. I believe mine whole-heartedly. I just wish I didn’t remember. It’s like the origin of human suffering. The root cause of my psychology and behavior."
176023034,The term is “self-fullfilling prophecies”. Whether it’s just a pop psychology term or if you believe in them and the concept has been proven true. IDK.
174347529,"Abilify made my paranoia, and voices worse. When I was on it, I couldn’t read without hearing VERY loud voices. I also wanted to put my head down in school and there sure wasn’t blackness… I fell in another dimension with lots of colors and started screaming in my head, held onto my desk. On risperidone, it happened, but toned down. I didn’t like anything about abilify"

176023040,Then ask your psychiatrist if you can get out?
176023041,most people in my life know what goes on with me so not telling or telling is not really a thing. I don’t think i would tell people that don’t know about me…

176023049,_PERSON_ definitely! Music for sure touches on something within. I don’t get them anymore now that I’m on meds… But those visuals were pretty neat for the most part.

176023051,"There is a time and place for it. When someone shares their struggles and gives me a real emotional brow beating sometimes I cry. I’m often touched by the stories on here and the problems we share. I don’t think that I’m held back by empathy, I’m just changed for it. I chose to be an empathic person, and sometimes the world beats me back into apathy, but I still hold that emotions have a powerful force in teaching us lessons on an instinctual level that you wouldn’t find any other way. The struggle is to know when to cut off your emotional attachments when problems won’t be solved when plights of suffering will know no balms. I think its cynical but necessary to live on and feel anything other then anger or sadness or hopelessness."
176023052,Worst years 2014-2016. Mainly 2015 due to paranoia and psychosis. Still didn’t hallucinate except when falling asleep but I was close. Dissociation was horrible until 2017 I think.
176023053,"I had intense religious delusions in 2015 in the mental hospital. I thought about everything. I would pick apart words and conversations. I was extremely delusional and paranoid. I had super hearing. Thought everyone was talking about me. Thought the cia was following me back then. When I went in, my doctor gave me Adderall. ?????? me up. I had severe delusions about my step father at the time. Feel like he gas lighted me. Made me freak out. I got severely triggered at the gaming center where I played video games…that started all this… I thought I was _NAME_ the _PERSON_ because I died like that a few times. Went back in time…I got called a fake Christian and Jesus freak. There were a ton of losers/criminals when I went there. A lot of people from the streets. I probably pissed them off. Psychosis can ruin ones life… It was comparable or worse than college. I feel like some girl I was interested had a parent that worked for the government. Could be more than one. Maybe a freemason connectio
n too. I dont know… My mind was spinning and broken. Cognitive decline. I couldn’t figure out the phone it was so bad. Basically I remembered my past lives. I said some rude, insensitive things there. I think they knew stuff about me. Something happened in college. I think the government targeted me for unknown reasons… Probably mk ultra - monarch. I was told this in a past life. Cant do ???? about it. In my other lives, I self destructed millions of times. Just trying to get help. I wanted to join the military in 2015, but glad I kept my mouth shut. I was delusional/crazy. I thought I was a false prophet even the antichrist because of simulation theory… I could go on but I won’t. They even sent ufos after me. See i got abducted by aliens like 10 times in my life. Not just this life but others. Its because of simulation theory. I think im _NAME_ titor the real one."
176023054,"I hope this medication works out. Can you tell me how propranolol is? Such as side effects or anything, I might have to go on it."
176023055,Can you call tomorrow? I’m sorry you can’t sleep. Going without sleep is awful.
176023056,OCD rarely causes psychotic features and it doesn’t cause delusions. But it is possible for you to have a primary psychotic disorder along with an anxiety disorder like OCD. This is what I have.

176023061,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I copied and pasted this: ‘The discovery that between 9% and 17% of patients in psychiatric facilities and emergency departments met criteria for catatonia’ - that is surprising. My concentration isn’t great so I couldn’t read it all.
176023062,"Sorry man, I know how it feels to have the world against but I get the feeling your a really nice person with a lot to offer the world. There’s so much fuuck heads in the world and your def not one of them, your just having a bad day."
176023063,Mine had this problem. I just called the tech support number and they sorted it out within a few days.
174347542,It’s common for those with schizophrenia or schizoaffevtive to have their hallucinations come and go sometimes even for months. That’s how it was for me at first. To avoid relapses you have to stay on meds all the time whether theres voices or not. It can be tempting to stop treatment but it must be maintained.
176023064,I just took more\ I have had half a bottle of red and 8 zopiclone tattles
176023065,I will do that. Thanks. That should help. I have been accused of diving too deep into my ‘delusions’.

174347543,Do you think you could afford something like abilify? It is weight neutral and has been out long enough now to where it may be more affordable. I am not sure. You are definitely in a tight spot and I’ve been there before myself…to buy some more time you could ask your doctor if he has any samples of your current med you could get…or even just samples of any AP…I’ve gotten tons of free meds that way doctors hand out samples like candy.

176023110,"I think people have a right to be scared. I’m scared too. I think it could go both ways. It could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing. I’ve been to private and public hospitals. Private are much better. Sometimes, abuse goes on and such. Scary people and such. The public hospitals are overcrowded and smell really bad. Scary people there too. People that belong in prison not a hospital. I don’t think it’s necessary the dark ages. It could be a good thing. I can’t really work and some of us are low functioning and have no future, really. I just occupy my room and get a small ‘pension’. If these hospitals and government really cared about us, which they probably do in SOME ways, others not so much, it could be a good thing. If you’re high functioning and can work and want to stay home and are a good person, sure, it’s scary, or if you had a bad experience in one years ago. Just my 2 cents. I think less government is better in this case/some cases and that government is the probl
em with some of these violent people and nobody really understands. It’s not just about hunting and stuff. It’s about gun rights and protecting you and your family. Violence is out of control. As a (delusional) quasi-immortal time traveler that knows we live in a sim and I’m stuck in a causal loop, I’ve seen _PERSON_ be president billions of times or more. Probably seen the best and the worst in different timelines/parallel universes. Fortunately, he is the best out of the two – believe it or not. I think this forum is run by _NAME_ fans and such and MSNBC constantly hates on _PERSON_ and twists his words. I have memories in the future/different timeline where I could live at the mental hospital and then see my mom and family on the weekend. It was awesome I guess – sometimes. I probably had limited cognition/awareness though. I worry about WW3, Cold wars with Russia and China, and fake alien invasions, and government experimentation (again, and again) (look at our history-- it ain’t a delusion)
. Long time ago (before 2014/2015) I had fantasies that I could live at the private mental hospital for eternity. It was much better back then, like a private resort. We could smoke, use our phone, have family hang out, and get any kind of food. It was awesome. But then 2015 hit and the paranoia, severe psychosis happened/_NAME_ and such and I started remembering horrific things like being murdered and tortured in montauk/monarch millions of times. I remember my private psychiatrist in a past life ask me if I wanted to participate in mk - ultra time travel program for $100k. I said yes. But my life ended up being only worth $10 or less on average and I never got the money – my mom did BECAUSE I cared about her more than myself in a past life. I’m not making this up. I must have done something bad/minor in a past life to be put through mk-ultra type ???? or at least to think this. But I’m a good/changed person. I always wanted to serve my country but not like that. I wanted to join the military with a bi
polar diagnosis. Something about a Cold War… I’m a proud Republican and stuff. No one understands me at all. I’ve seen _NAME_ win a million times or more and I’ve seen _PERSON_ win a billion times or more. I’ve seen it all. I’ve seen everything, but cannot remember everything. _PERSON_ was definitely the less of the two evils. He’s saving this country. I expect a lot of hate but I speak the Truth and this post was political to begin with. Honestly, we’re probably heading under fascism/aristocracy in the long run, but I think it’s better than communism in the long run. Just my thoughts. God bless."

176023117,"You should know that everything in life is a game. The purpose of games is education. Forex trading, done properly, teaches one about the nature of the various national economies at a given time. One does not do it for profit, though that is part of it, one learns to judge which nation’s economy is in ascendance and which is in decline at any given moment. This allows one to consider the dynamics of the world as we know it. However, for myself, I am worried that I have devoted too much time to such things already, having spent years paying attention to history and the news. The combination of these two things has been one of the biggest triggers for my psychosis in the past and I am somewhat apprehensive of trying again, even if I am legally entitled to do so in my present condition.

For ten years, there was no med who pulled me out with being in peace… Currently, I make my small walks around my building and the rest, I try to be active at home… Theres also my broken heart about my ex, but I got, that I can be happy with somebody else… I cant force this, when theres no love lol… But yeah, its strange the aps never sedated my brain till the point, that it feels ‘‘relaxed’’.

174347560,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Use of tobacco in schizophrenia: A double-edged sword. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Brain and behavior , Oct 2019 11 It has been identified that the smoking rate is higher in schizophrenic patients than general population. This study aimed to explore the association between schizophrenia and tobacco use, and provide rational recommendations for clinical care of schizophrenia.We recruited 244 patients with schizophrenia and 225 healthy controls. Of schizophrenia patients, 54 patients were untreated with any antipsychotics over the previous 6 months or first-episode and drug-naïve. These patients (nonmedication subgroup) were followed up for 8 weeks. The associations between tobacco use and susceptibility to schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms were analyzed.Although there was no significant difference between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in the entire sample, stratification analysis showed the rate of smoking was higher in 
male patients versus healthy controls and that male smokers exhibited higher odds ratios for schizophrenia than nonsmokers. Next, when we repeated analyses in first-episode patients and healthy controls, significant differences were not observed, indicating tobacco use is an outcome rather than a cause of schizophrenia. Furthermore, among nonmedication subgroup, smokers presented with more severe psychotic symptoms at baseline, and better improvement after medication than nonsmokers, suggesting patients with worse symptoms tend to smoke to relieve symptoms.This study supports the self-medication hypothesis. Nonetheless, considering the serious health hazard associated with tobacco use, we should encourage patients to stop smoking. Further investigations are warranted to determine the tobacco constituents that are beneficial or harmful to schizophrenia."

176023253,"The neighbors are scaring me. They do low stuff and it makes me wonder how far they will go to destroy me. Today, I even mused at work that would they kill me. That thought came and went fast though. I had plenty of time to myself at work today and came up with a theory of why I can’t make myself clear as to what they’re doing. I think it’s because I’m always assuming that they’re doing stuff that all rotten people do. But now I’m thinking that what they do is particular to them. Last night I was sitting on the couch and reminiscing about my teen years. It dawned on me that a particular incident was a form of power. I can’t remember what it was. I think I was thinking about when I won some confrontation. I thought, yeah, I have a little power too. Because these guys for the past year have been bugging me and manipulating and flat out intimidating and always win. I mean wouldn’t a normal person try to assert themselves every once in a blue moon? The guy upstairs immediately *ucked wi
th my mind and erased me experience like it never happened. This is how I live, these people don’t care how much they mess with me or when. They do similar stuff all the time. Frankly, that scares me. I think, how much further will they go to have whatever hold they have on me. They already stamp out any sign of life I show. Is my fate to be the victim of these losers because they think they know what’s good for me and they want me to be this lifeless, dead body who they can use at will for their own personal use? I’ve never experienced stuff like this in my life. They have no regard for fairness or common decency."

176023254,"I used to drink coffee in the morning - used to give me anxiety and a slight euphoric feeling Since taking AP meds, I can drink as much coffee as I like and I will not feel anything at all - no anxiety, no buzz - nothing!"
176023255,If I don’t take meds I’d be a roller coaster of mood swings and violent urges and I’d hear voices more I guess I’d be in and out of hospital all the time in my bad phases And have to rely on therapy in my good phases
176023256,"Ya this happens. Most people don’t get it at all. Basically there are two camps, the type who think schizophrenics are just weak minded and those that are terrified of the illness and think we’re all psycho killers. There are a few odd folks who empathize better than others, and maybe I exaggerate when I say ‘most’, but a lot of people just don’t get it. Sz makes one realize there is much about our brains that is relatively out of our control."

Also if you arent going to report all tips you probably want to talk out a strategy w your coworkers, otherwise it would be extremely obvious. Now im jist rambling…ok…that is all."
174347591,I cut back when I switched from 10mg Zyprexa to 5mg Abilify last May. I started hallucinating and got paranoid. My pdoc had to up it to 10mg. I occasionally hallucinate on 10mg.

I find it remarkable actually that the same drug is used to treat different disorders. I read something yesterday and it said the FDA had approved amisulpride for injection - but it wasn’t for schizophrenia. I wish I could remember what it was now, but that’s still a step in the right direction for mental health in the US - if true"

You cannot extrapolate that data from those studies. Completely impossible except in a delusion.

176023356,That sounds nice. I hope to have a date soon. The girl I’m talking with is watching a movie at the beach I didn’t understand what she meant till she showed me a picture of a giant screen on a beach. Maybe we’ll go out tomorrow. Saturday.

The key to break the negative symptom is to develop daily good habits or schedules and follow them without fail. Ex: sleep and wake at same time everyday, bath before going to sleep at night, exercise for at least 20 minutes daily etc. Important thing is to follow them daily without skipping. When you do it it becomes easy to follow though at first it seems tough. These habits, schedules help us to remain productive even though negative symptoms like blunted affect, lack of emotions, anhedonia there."

176023364,Have you read a schizohrenia symptoms list? Do you identify with any of the symptoms?
174347627,No drama’s. Problem is that if it’s schizophrenia like most of us around here you’ll hit psychosis and then there’s little choice. Yes. People survive and move on without antipsychotics but for those who are multi episodic it’s usually something you need to function… Function is the key to the whole question. If you struggle and go psychotic again. Take the pills. If you survive without more power to you…unless it’s like insidious onset. I just moved from doing ok to psychosis and it wasn’t any fun at all.

Usually I don’t take them in an amount that causes addiction, but this time I was trapped by the drug, so now I have to quit that too, and im fine with that too, but also a little anxious. This time the withdrawal is just annoying, im not sick, like when I was given pain medication (ultram/tramadol) by my doctor for severe bladder pain. I end up as a monk in monastery."

It still gives me satisfaction and avoids a lot of stress. Ideas for writing often come out of the blue and I can go long times without doing it or write several things in a short time.

174347647,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Relationship between self-disclosure to first acquaintances and subjective well-being in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders living in the community. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PloS one , 2019 Focusing on people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders living in the community, the present study aims to examine the characteristics of and gender differences in self-disclosure to first acquaintances, and to clarify the relationship between self-disclosure and subjective well-being.Participants (32 men and 30 women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders) were examined using the subjective well-being inventory, an original self-disclosure scale for people with mental illness, as well as the _PERSON_ self-esteem scale, the Link devaluation-discrimination scale, and the affiliation scale.The self-disclosure content domains in descending order were as follows: ""living conditions,"" ""own strengths,"" ""experiences of distress,"" and ""mental illnes
s and psychiatric disability."" There were no significant gender differences in self-disclosure in the total and domain scores. Multiple regression analyses by gender revealed that: (1) in men, decreasing feelings of ill-being were significantly predicted by self-disclosure about ""living conditions,"" self-esteem, and perceived _USER_ID_; (2) in women, increasing feelings of well-being were significantly predicted by self-disclosure about ""own strengths,"" self-esteem, and sensitivity to rejection.Self-disclosure to first acquaintances was related to subjective well-being in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders living in the community. This result supports the recovery model and the strengths model. It suggests the importance of interventions targeting self-disclosure to first acquaintances about experiences as human beings, such as ""living conditions"" and ""own strengths,"" as it relates to subjective well-being in community-based mental health rehabilitation."

176023473,My legs just want to dance constantly two hours after my night meds. Is really frustrating. I take procyclidine but it’s not doing much. Heard beta blockers can help
176023474,"i too, agree being honest to your psychiatrist. If your doctor are really there to help you, he/she will access you better with your honest opinion on yourself with truths and facts of yourself. it really helps most of the time. Just for references, my psychiatrist is abit pushy, but i do know she just wants to help me. that’s for me, but if she goes beyond that, i would tell her that i am uncomfortable with that. A doctor and patient relationship should be built on mutual respect and not just someone who forces some meds down the throat of what they called a patient (just an analogy). as for now, your psychiatrist might understands the situation of you more than you do, as psychiatrist have their theory and most of their theory are right. So telling the truth to your psychiatrist might help for now as i read your message _NAME_ a.k.a lordarous"
174347650,"Yes. It is a general rule, so it holds for all possible disorders that can explain the PD symptoms. Sz/sza and other psychotic disorders are especially relevant alternative explanations to PD symptoms, though. The DSM mentions sz, mood disorders with psychotic features and other psychotic disorders under schizotypal PD and antisocial PD, but the rule still holds for the other personality disorders through the general criterion E: “The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.” The ICD-10 has a similar general criterion, and an unstated rule is that a PD must predate sz/sza to be diagnosable. Schizotypal is not diagnosable alongside schizophrenia/schizoaffective in the ICD as the ICD classifies it as a psychotic disorder and not a PD, and all other psychotic disorders are an exclusion criterion for schizotypal."
176023475,It’s incredibly common and can be complicated by things like negatives and depression. I always rely on routines to get through my week.

176023481,If you are looking for a good natural anti-depressant I would recommend a high dose vitamin D. Say minimum 5000IU. It has done wonders for me. I think everyone who are depressed should try this first since there are no side-effects. I think I read that 5000IU is equivialent to spending just under 1 hour in the sun when comparing to the body making D-vitamin on its own.
176023482,You’ve been acting out the last few days _PERSON_. I would make sure to check in with a Pdoc and check that everythings going okay.

I’ve met these people at the mental hospital many times. I dont think I’m that egocentric to think its all for me. But I think I’m in a simulation for various reasons like punishment or hell or to study me because I have memories, I’m in a loop, and i have had schizophrenia thousands or millions of times. My family died many times due to me thinking I was _NAME_ titor and being targeted among other things in my past lives and i met the computer simulators asking for them to re build or keep the ancestor simulation around. I wish i could go back to my childhood. It was perfect. It feels like a quantum _NAME_ simulation that runs almost indefinitely. I’ve lived through nuclear war and the end or near end of the world hundreds or thousands of times. It seems like hell. I think I even helped run the simulation to help us. I put it on repea

My mommy doesnt care about me, please dont touch me there, after dinner clouds out if the blue. I always hear them internally but heard some schizophrenic people have internal voices as well. Do they sound like thoughts? Could this just be random thoughts? I get in fights internally sometimes. Is that common with schizophrenia?"

Just because a person can speak well or excels in a particular subject such as math does not mean they are able in all areas. A person with high functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome may appear more capable that he/she really is. Executive functioning skills ( the ability to prioritize tasks, organize, or see the individual steps in a routine), are often impaired in the autism population. The lack of these skills can make independent living difficult. Don’t assume a person can organize his day just because he has high intelligence.

176023508,I’m glad you get to see your sister! Are you close? Does she know you struggle?
176023509,Withdrawal symptoms will come and go in waves for a few months. Probably.
176023510,I wish I wasnt diagnosed with psychosis
174347658,_PERSON_ sounds more serious to me. Schizophrenia AND bipolar symptoms? Noooo thank you
176023511,"I mean I’m not your doctor, but yes. Yes you do."
176023512,Does the general population need to wait till July?
174347662,1 months or 2 until now. I have psychotic disorder NOS. Sometimes i think i’m almost normal and sometimes i think they not found what i have and don’t know how to medicate me yet… I love this low dose because i feel so normal. Ooor without insight ahaha i dont know
176023513,"In the beginning I was cheerful, polite, outgoing, pretty, and these days I am more shy, still polite, private, and not as good looking like I usually was. Also I suffer from panic/anxiety attacks and intrusive thoughts and I feel like I have people in my body."
174347660,Yes. It’s a different world these days. Back in the day it wasn’t healthy. We had people who didn’t have schizophrenia who really preyed and did things contrary to our community. I think those days are past but we still have peep’s who push the boundaries. Trolls aren’t so much our problem anymore which is good. Still. Schizophrenia should be our primary concern and those who fall around the boundaries should be conscious of that. Thus some good moderation.
174347665,"It has lessened my positive symptoms of psychosis, and I was fairly symptomatic before going on it."
174347663,for me the positives are worse… i have some negatives now but i wouldn’t trade them for positives.
176023514,I have caffeine pills that equal two cups of coffee. If I need to get going but have no time for coffee I pop one.
176023515,I can’t finish my last one… I’m invested in Flames of War a WW2 miniatures game but I’m eyeing off Warhammer 40K new boxed sets…I need to finish one project than moving onto another but so many cool things to buy and I love games…
176023516,Seriously that 741741 text line is great. I use it frequently. They just brainstorm coping exercises with you.

176023518,I will never come off my medication unless my pdoc thinks it is a good idea. My last psychosis I was horrible to deal with. I don’t want to put my partner through that again.

176023520,I was misdiagnosed with a lot of things until I actually admitted to what was going on in my head. Then the proper diagnosis was reached.
174347667,"_AT_MENTION_ Some users here were diagnosed with sz at 15y.o or earlier and had symptoms as early as 10-11y.o., _AT_MENTION_-Cotton for example and another user I forgot the name. I had sz positive symptoms since 15-16y.o. but was diagnosed at 20 after 2 suicide attempts. I wouldnt have tried to kill myself if I was diagnosed earlier, since 15y.o. I told 3 general Drs that I have voices and feel unreal, they said its stress. Its sad that here in Canada we can’t see a psychiatriat without approval of a general Dr who isnt trained to detect and treat mental illness."
176023521,"That’s alright _AT_MENTION_ you practised and that’s what matters. Practice doesn’t necessarily mean perfect, but it’s a step forward."
176023522,"I would be happier having one or two close friends I could count on, who know me fully, and want to be in my life. A gaggle of acquaintanceships? No thank you"

174347672,I imagine a website with the only word in it being “schizophrenia” is a target in many ways. But only 3 IP(?) bans isn’t too bad i guess. Thats totally ridiculous someone tried to sell suicide pills wtfz.
174347670,If you have voices alone you can be diagnosed schizophrenia. But if you have delusions too you’re even more likely to get the diagnosis. Or cognitive or negative symptoms. Or disorganized speech. Or visual hallucinations. I think you have to have at least 2 of them if you don’t have hallucinations to get sz diagnosis. Sorry if that sounds confusing
174347666,xTry to detach from these conditions/and deprogram from the illusions you tell yourself.
174347664,"Both my positive and negative symptoms are very severe but luckily my positive symptoms are 90% treated with meds. I have mild to moderate cognitive symptoms too, I forget a lot and I am only 30 y.o."
176023524,Did you try clomipramine?
176023525,I used to delete and anonymize all my forums accounts when I was off meds because I was scared of ppl. I regretted it after I was put on meds again.

174347675,"I am surprised nobody mentioned “akathisia” yet. It’s a form of restlessness induced by some antipsychotics. I used to have it on amisulpride and risperidone, but not on aripiprazole."
176023530,Don’t worry about the Godzilla they know where to find you me every ??????? day.
176023531,Welcome! I tend to smoke after my psychosis and I do a while then quit when I’m straightening out. I think it’s anxiety for me causing me to smoke.

176023537,Thankyou! Madamouselle
176023538,"Oh well, it is not the end of the world! Has the pdoc medicated you for his diagnosis? If you can live as an ‘eccentric’ without meds it is probably the best case scenario imho. If you can function and live normally without meds without your bizarre beliefs impinging on your life then good luck to you. I say bizarre because beliefs in angels and demons err on the side of eccentricity in normal society. Personally I think that believing in the supernatural and or religion is a massive complication when it comes to living with sz, but each to their own. This is certainly the case for a pdoc who relies on the scientific basis for reality. Welcome to the club of sz anyway. Try not to let it overtake your life."
176023539,try to hold on to hope the best you can.
176023540,Are you doing it yourself or going to e.g. a clinic?
176023541,I have fears about Navy SEALs wanting to torture me. I totally get your fears. I’m sorry you’re going through this
176023542,I was thinking about alternating between taking and stopping meds. I take meds when I feel paranoid about students in school then stop. Idk if its possible or if I will completely refuse meds. Last time I refused after stopping but maybe now its different idk.
176023543,So this file it is not from your pdoc? What is this about the government?
176023544,"did you ever think of joining a mental health club…im a member of one and these places are good for meeting likeminded people…mental health clubs are places where mentally ill folk can go to participate in art creative writing, drama, yoga or group therapy to name but a few activities or else you can just drop in for a coffee or a chat…as i say there is no pressue to participaate."

176023546,"I get fatigued/depressed if I spend too much time online, but this forum is ok. The more “quiet” my online activity is, the better it is for my psyche. Surfing or rambling through searchengines and the likes is bad for me, so I’m trying to always have a plan before I go online now."

176023563,"Metafoline is folinic acid. There is a hypothesis saying that the presumably low levels of 5MTHF in the CSF in some patients may be treated with folinic acid, which gets around the usual blood-to-CSF transport route and thus is able to better increase the folate levels in the brain: # The basis for folinic acid treatment in neuro-psychiatric disorders Mind that it’s only a hypothesis at this stage. Further, 5-MTHF supposedly helps some patients with resistant depression, also by sidestepping the usual blood-to-CSF route and increasing the levels of folate in the brain and the spinal cord. There is also no definitive proof of this. No definitive rebuttal either. It’s an interesting sphere of study, “folate-related single carbon metabolism in psychiatric disorders”."

174347691,No one here can tell you if you have depression or negative symptoms. Even Drs can have a hard time differentiating those.
174347690,"I think best is to allow yourself to feel some positive symptoms so that your extreme negative symptoms can get better. For this you need to ask your pdoc to reduce already taking risperidone dose. But you must be prepared to self manage some of the positive symptoms you might experience due to that. If get voices, thoughts then must not respond to it nor entertain it."

174347693,I believe a chip or some type of nano device is inserted in us and thru manipulation they can give us the symptoms of schizophrenia And because we don’t know it We go running to a pdoc with these symptoms and get the diagnosis of schizophrenia and then we lose all credibility Because of the diagnosis in case we find them out.

176023580,"I’m a nurse who has worked on the general surgical ward, and had a lot of experience with people who had colon cancer. While it may be gross to send away stool samples and getting a colonoscopy may be embarrassing, believe me, it is a damn sight better than not doing those two things and the colon cancer isn’t picked up. Two things could happen then - you could require surgery to remove the affected part of the colon, and you may need a colostomy bag. The surgery will be painful and embarrassing as it isn’t uncommon for people to soil themselves after the surgery as their body hasn’t yet gotten used to the changes post surgery. It is 10 x more embarrassing being cleaned up by nurses than getting a colonoscopy. Then of course, there is the risk you don’t pick the cancer up in time, and that would just be so sad. Colon cancer is such a treatable cancer, and if picked up early, you have a high chance of recovery. So send in those samples, and take a deep breath and have that colonoscopy. It 
could be worse. I wish you all the best…i apologise if i sound preachy…i don’t mean time."

176023635,"i need people to understand me , feel me, and stand by my side when i talk to them at least. i am a person deprived of correct love yet not given. with this condition i was made to face the cruel life of feeling being alone in spiritual and soul yet surrounded by many people physcially. as if it’s ok to be devoided of feelings, misunderstanding, being labelled, not being loved correctly, living in an environment full of lies and uncertainty. the main “medicine” for me at least is love, the others are only supportive attributes. but no one arounds me ever gets it. they are like fixing me like a broken furniture with no feelings in regards, a broken leg of a chair just needs to be fixed and restored, others are unnecessary."
176023636,Lol! That’s funny _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ !!!
176023637,I stopped using Melatonin because of the restless legs. I’m pretty sure that some sleeping meds don’t do this while some others do.

176023639,"It was recommended here for me with invega, but I went with prozac because of depression"
174347716,You stated you had ‘delusions of reference and hallucinations’. To me that is in the schizophrenia ballpark and needs to be investigated more closely by your psychiatrist. Nobody knows your own body better than you. Perhaps seek a second opinion from another doctor (if you are able to).
176023640,"_AT_MENTION_, That’s interesting. Taking classes on a noncredit basis. I wonder if they will let me do that since I’m out of state?"
176023641,I would walk and talk to myself for hours . I never became violent luckily. I did while walking travel to other states and cities… Then pass out from the walking then get up and do it again. It wasn’t fun.

I take 10 mg of Haldol, 20 mg of Celexa and 3 mg of Cogentin"
174347709,I had some issues like this the voices were really evil and said it wasnt schizophrenia they made sure to make me think it was telepathy and that it was a sign of the end of times they said if told someone about them they will make sure i got locked up on the asylum forever when i answered to them they always got angry at me and made me look like the bad guy.
176023646,This is my sza symptoms - Alien and _NAME_ the spirits live in my head and talk to me and each other sometimes. Alien puts his thoughts in my head and occasionally steals mine. My mother in law will try to poison me eventually Seeing an ambulance is a bad sign that something bad will happen to me Deadness Depression Self harm Irritable mood Short periods of Hypomania Lack of insight sometimes Chronic avolition (inability to start and finish tasks and goals) My brain becomes like water Agitation Shower only once a week (although I do wash my private area and face and hands regularly) Brush teeth once every three days No libido (this could be the meds not the sza)
176023647,"Yes. There are people who think I am odd. It doesn’t matter if I’m psychotic or not. I consider myself diferent, but not odd."
176023648,That’s fine my friend. I will back away. I have expressed my feelings about it. We agree to disagree.
176023649,"_NAME_ says he would have to know what you’re selling, says there’s lots of groups on Facebook that are very active. I’m on one from my area, Quad Cities, Buy, Sell and Trade. so, I guess you’d want to look for yours too."
176023650,"Doctor’s would have prescribed it long time ago if it cured these symptoms. But its always good to have hope and I am thinking about trying Risperdal+Sarcosine. I personally don’t care about prostate cancer because its not dangerous and will only happen when you’re old, 60+. I just turned 30."
176023651,yes I did very well on it actually. I should try to get on it again. just going to a clinic feels impossible
176023652,We had a lovely day today. It felt great to sit outside in 70 degree weather.
176023653,Cable news doesn’t trigger me but the local news can be triggering.
176023654,"Never had this before, so is there any sort of treatment the psychiatrist is going to put you on to help?"
176023655,"You do realize that’s ridiculous, right? That’s like me saying that I want to be borderline grandiose and deciding that an acceptable solution is to quit my AP. What happens if you stop your meds and then you have a fully blown manic episode that results in involuntary hospitalization? No one knows they’re bipolar 1 until they hit mania. Do you really want to take that chance due to the slim possibility that you’ll be borderline hypomanic?"
176023656,you say that now but not back then…
176023657,The max I can do now is play video games with friends.
176023658,Yes I worry about it. I’m nearly 50. Apparently eating just 300 calories less than youd normally eat is great for your cardiovascular health. So I’m sticking to 1800 calories a day. I’ll also be losing weight at that level.
176023659,Ever since Little LED was a baby my most persistent voice is a crying baby. It’s so hard to ignore.
174347717,"I’ve had symptoms as long as I can remember. Even before I can remember as a toddler my mom tells me I was very fearful and always reported there being ghosts in my room or other weird things. My earliest memories are literally of hallucinating at age 3. I wasn’t diagnosed with a psychotic disorder until 19, but my parents also didn’t let me seek professional help when I lived at home and I was scared to share the full extent of my experiences in therapy until then as well. I had my first major episode at age 16."
176023660,"I had a period of time where I couldn’t read. As a voracious reader, this really made me sad. But one day, it came back. Was about a year or year and a half of no reading more than online posts."
176023661,The voices are hyping me up. Idk how to describe it. They’re like talking me into doing dangerous stuff like speeding and just being impulsive. I feel great and I just can’t believe why they’d try to hurt me. If this book doesn’t take off it’ll be the end of all three of us and that isnt what he had in mind from the start
176023662,I am one of them.

176023667,"en.wikipedia.org _PERSON_ effect In the field of psychology, the _PERSON_ effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability.

174347730,I’m not sure if I mean private practices but more like your mom or care provider meets with a 50 year old schizophrenic guy or girl who’s been through a lot (you possibly when you’re 50) and you figure if you’re a good match. Like some type of database where the less experienced person seeks out the more experienced person. But yeah I know what you mean. Private practices is the wrong word. It implies that you’re on a different level w/ one another The whole point is to be on the same level.

Constantly questioning people’s motives, and deleting them out of my life. It feels terrible and I often regret it. But so does the anxiety and paranoia. Anyone else?"

176023688,"It takes a lot of practice. Instead of writing a letter to my alter self, I pretended I was writing to a future foster kid I might adopt who might have gone through similar things. Since that was a very real possibility for me, it felt easier and more realistic. And, as it turned out, I did end up getting kids who were VERY similar to me and that practice paid off when they started asking the tough questions."

176023694,I got SSDI easily. I went through 7 jobs in 6 years and failed at all of them. I had no lawyer and they gave me no exam. My medical records read really bad though. I have had many inpatient hospitalizations. My reviews were scheduled for every 5 to 7 years which is supposed to mean they don’t expect you to improve. I applied in 2014 after I quit my last of 7 jobs. I got approved in less than three months but I didn’t get any back pay because I had been working. They made my disability date the day I applied. And then you have to wait 5 months for benefits. You probably shouldn’t work during that time so you have to be able to afford being unemployed for 5 months. I started working a little again in 2017 and now I have gone back to work full time and I am not going to get anymore SSDI payments anymore so long as I keep working. I should have applied in 2010 or so though but I refused to believe I was sick then. It was good to have for a few years while I put myself back together. Your payment i
s based on how much you paid into the program and I had paid a lot so my check was a decent amount. It depends upon your work history.

My main concerns at work are completing the tasks I’m assigned, being friendly and talking to people and having fun, in that order. The disease kind of comes and goes, and ebbs and flows. Luckily at work, most of what they tell me to do I don’t mind. Work ain’t always a picnic but it ain’t bad either."

Whatever they say about what sz is ,The sz health condition (structure / function) remains NOT the sums of diagnostic symptoms or any types of change,disorder or defect that occurs in the basic nature of the human being Like you say,sz is a perception of new psychological user (s) in the youth age without corresponding of creation factors ! It is coming from absolute nothingness ,or it is coming by its temper ! Finding a casual relationship between any genetic mutation and a new living health condition of a new psychological user (s) that they are not human, be considered a mission impossible for the geneticists,because the sz is a living entity in nature and is not any type of disease symptoms at all ! The sz health condition is represented in the psychotic factor who is called hallucinations-in the public culture,and the hallucinations as be felt by ALL people 
with sz is a whole living entity like the human psychological self BUT it is more advanced ! the mechanisms that are responsible to creation the human psychological self in the first decade of life IS NOT the mechanisms that create the new psychological user (S) in the third decade of life ,because it is not a part from the psychological component of the human being ,it is strange and have different cultural background and personal behavior ,it acts and behaves in the human nature as a parasitic psychological user (s) !!"

174347756,"Hi _AT_MENTION_, Yes, I was trying to cheer you up and make you feel better. But I was also trying to maybe give you tangible help that you can incorporate into your daily life. Or maybe even help you change your perspective and change the way you think about yourself and life. Like I said, we’re not professionals or magicians and can’t solve every problem but we have a lot of experience with schizophrenia and a lot of people here have a lot of life experience. I’ve had schizophrenia for forty years, it doesn’t make me an expert on it but I’ve learned some things about living with it and coping with it. I just want to say here that many people, schizophrenic or not, have your same problem with self-esteem and poor self-image you do. More than you would think. And over the years, I’ve met many people who have a hard time accepting compliments, myself included. Now at age 59, I still have a hard time accepting compliments but sometimes I just listen and yeah, I believe a lot of good thing
s about myself that people have told me. I mean, compliments are free but they don’t happen every day so when they occasionally happen I learned to sometimes accept them. Even if I don’t believe them at the time that someone is giving me one I will think about it later when I’m alone and give myself permission to feel good. It’s OK to feel good about yourself even if some people don’t like you or have a low opinion of you. Believe it when people say you’re a nice, empathetic person. Don’t worry about your whole society, that’s a huge, vast subject. It’s like worrying about stopping war or world hunger. It’s not something the average individual can change. Society is made up of individuals and even if your society is ignorant and condemns mental illness there’s still plenty of individuals who are decent people who are nice to the more unfortunate members of society and look past the illness and see the good in people. Lots of people, myself included, have (or had in the past) so called no
rmal friends. I’ve had friends who were schizophrenic and I’ve had or hung out with many people who were not schizophrenic. The people I knew without schizophrenia never bugged me about it, We were too busy having fun and doing things. But it just goes to show that there’s people out there who aren’t jerks or ignorant. Far from it. I’m luckier than most because I can work, and an added bonus is that I’ve got to be around a lot of ordinary, “normal” people . I see people aren’t that bad. That’s what I’ve learned. Worrying about something as huge as society is non-productive. Worry about how you are going to help yourself or find help is a smaller, more manageable,r more realistic goal. All this stuff you write about yourself is common. It’s also changeable with the right help. You’re not responsible for all the abuse and bad things that have happened to you but now you’re responsible for dealing with it and making changes that can help you get over it. You were dealt bad cards but i
t’s up to you to make the best of it and live your life better. I hope all this makes sense and maybe gives you hope or inspires you to make some changes for the better. Maybe it will give you a better perspective on people or life. This is a horrible disease but it doesn’t mean we can’t get a little something out of life. It is not always degenerative. Hell, I’m 59 and I’m still taking college classes online and in my current class I am making an A so far. I’ve been at my lowly janitor job for seven years and drive some of California’s most congested freeways on a regular basis. I am still sharp. I take care of myself and I put up with a lot of crap from people but I give it back often or just laugh it off or say a joke that defuses the situation. I’m not perfect and I’m still learning about life but I’ve felt the same way you do at certain periods and deal with it a 100% better than when I was younger. I don’t know what else to tell you. I could go on for awhile but this is long enough 
already. I’ll leave you with this: Change and recovery is a reality. I’ve done it and seen many other people do it. Your bad feelings are real but so is the potential to change and have a good recovery. I wish you the best, good night."

176023745,"en.m.wikipedia.org Sorites paradox The sorites paradox (/so??ra?ti?z/; sometimes known as the paradox of the heap) is a paradox that arises from vague predicates. A typical formulation involves a heap of sand, from which grains are individually removed. Under the assumption that removing a single grain does not turn a heap into a non-heap, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times: is a single remaining grain still a heap? If not, when did it change from a heap to a non-heap? The word ""sori..."

You might consider trying lower doses of your current med, maybe taking a lower dose every other day might help you. I’m gonna ask my doc for both 5 and 2.5mg zyprexa so I can alternate my dose between 7.5 and 5mg. Even small changes can better life quality."

174347755,"I have all these same symptoms and have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Pain/discomfort and muscle spasm or pain in muscle or loss of muscle control are very common for me. Also the hyperreflexivity I have causes me to over-aim in shooters online, where I react too aggressively and basically throw my mouse way too far in the direction I need to be aiming, not because I don’t know how to aim correctly but because my body doesn’t do what I tell it to."
176023778,"I was on 300 mg once per day at the time. We tried 150 but the voices were pretty rough and I just wanted them gone so I went to none after a couple weeks at 150. So far Cymbalta is doing well for me as an anti depressant with no side effects. When I took it with my strattera it caused really bad insomnia, but my doctor removed strattera because he said it was redundant since Cymbalta serves a similar function with dopamine, and since doing that I haven’t had insomnia and I haven’t been too depressed."

I watched documentary, _NAME__PERSON_ son, and his struggle, and it turned abruptly to this son’s adult son, or Nash’s grandson, and he said, in the interview, Yeah, I’ve heard voices. His dad made it seem like he didn’t have it, sz. and had never known he was hearing voices. I sure hope this wasn’t stardom, but I started to wonder, if the direct link was more prevalent in this grandson, than his dad. maybe both, idk. The grandson had an attitude of being blown off by his dad, he left the room."
174347757,Oh Abilify is much better with lesser side effects…you’ll like it. And more expensive too.
176023780,"Not like SZ. Anxiety has a low heritability, and anyone can experience it. Anxiety disorders are among the least biologically based mental illnesses. There really aren’t many researchers who think SZ is a psychogenic disorder, and there aren’t many who think most cases of anxiety are genetic."

174347770,"One thing I realized is that if you don’t have goals and are steadily working towards them you will be a drifter in life. For me it’s the small things now that make me happy. Less side effects, stability of the mind, no more constipation, eating healthy, maintaining my hygiene, dressing good and smelling good, having a job, being financially stable, having a support group, a good family, a roof over my head, staying motivated, no more depression, staying motivated, staying active and busy. Don’t get me wrong I still have my bad days but I’ve been stable and out of the hospital for about a year and a half now and making sure I never go back. But overall these are the small things I appreciate that make me happy."
176023787,"Do you mean your voices? Sorry, you’re not making a lot of sense."
176023788,Maybe you could take a little bit more. For example 11 mg or even 10.5 mg and see what happens. If that is possible. I’m the same way. I get scared of side effects. I don’t want to change medicine either. The side effects stress me out a lot.
176023789,"I’m so excited right now. I was stalled for so long (a whole month), but this week it’s all just fallen off! Almost 10 pounds (9.6 lbs) in only 7 days! Makes me feel better about eating so much yesterday. Let’s just hope the holidays don’t ruin all my progress!"

The improvement consists of 5 components: I have had the idea that when I ride a car, it is better to be in a rear seat. My body is better able to handle a car ride when I am on a rear seat. And it seems to work. I have had the idea that when I try to fall asleep I need to close my eyes. This idea so far seems to work and it has improved my capacity to fall asleep. I have returned to health club after a long period of absence. Recently I only did aerobic training at home and now I added to this strength training at health club. I have returned to studying mathematics after a very long period of not studying, albeit the studies were several minutes a day. Voices and intrusive thoughts have stopped bothering me.

I have had some weight gain but the biggest side effect is loss of libido which I understand is caused by elevated prolactin levels. I’m lowering my dose after getting ok from psychiatrist. I’m lowering to 2.5mg for next six months and then to 2mg. Want to know if I can expect any improvement on 2.5 or 2mg. Tried ability and it didn’t work and there’s no other meds my medical aid will cover that I’m willing to try. I’m high functioning on the risperidone.

I personally don’t have a pathogenic variant- and that’s why we’re still looking. And yes, I think it’s genetic too. Also, see a genetic counselor/geneticist."

174347792,"_PERSON_ seems to imply that the truth is too traumatic to be faced, at least because it results in the dissolution of self, and that coming too close to it leads to schizophrenia. So, I think he is saying that schizophrenia, including all the related delusions (of grandeur and irreality) are escapism, from a sort of fundamental human trauma (_PERSON_, 2009, p.207) - of having an ‘other in mind’. That might reiterate the last two posts – schizophrenics were smarter, then took a big hit. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ (2009). Others in mind: Social origins of self-consciousness.

My mindset is generally much more bearable. Before I was so negative all the time I got really low. So I see this lexapro as kind of a safety net for my mental health. It will bounce me back up if I need it. Also. I should note that I am schizoaffective current depressive type. I was worried about going too far up into mania, but that hasn’t been a problem yet.

Now I’m like fairly normal as far as that goes, it’s remarkable. Prior to that I was craving the benzos like crazy and mad that I couldn’t get all I thought I needed. Now I don’t want them at all.

I started to have seizures and now I am developing some sort of contracture on my knees, and it’s so hard to bend them now. The conclusion is, if your physical health declines, the rest declines as well. Please take care of your body before it declines, so that you could make sure that you are healthy physically to continue your recovery again.

176023903,"Is it in my head? The counselor (in reality) acknowledged that it must be hard not to be able to defend my own apartment. If the neighbors aren’t doing anything why would she say that? I told her the jerk-off upstairs was really nice to me yesterday and we cleared the air and maybe we can get along. I talked to the counselor today and I went a little overboard about how things are going to change and I’m going to change. But her parting words were, “Well, if they laugh loudly past 10:00 pm then report them to the property manager.” I can’t fight these guys. They can take one of my experiences and totally nullify it. Erase it. That’s what happens when you let just anybody in here. Can I forgive someone for the sh*t they’ve done to me, while they are still doing it?"

I quit my meds after my 1st psychosis and I experienced another psychosis before 6 months has passed unmedicated. Then my psychiatrist wrote SZ with negative symptoms, apathy, avolition and anhedonia in my diagnosis report. I tried quitting meds another time and I had paranoia, hallucinations and delusions for a year until I experienced acute psychosis and was brought the mental hospital by 4 cops because I was aggressive. After that, I decided to never quit my meds again to avoid killing or suicide."

174347800,"My schizophrenia gave me relief of about a half an hour to 1h during which I felt no unpleasant feelings at all. Then it continued with intensified unpleasant feelings. The voices said they know what’s happening to me is very bad - at least to me (then an inserted thought came saying they referred to some extraterrestrial species benefiting from my torture), but that they don’t care - they’re indifferent and emotionless beings, and then kept repeating “It does not make any difference!

176023925,Hello. I’ve been on Olanzapine for a few years now. They started me on it when I got put into hospital and I didn’t like it so would put it out the window of my room there I’ve been on it a few years now though and even had the dose increased to 12.5mg. I still don’t like it and think if I was off it again I’d be happier or something but I’m staying on it (even if it’s such a huge dose). I can’t remember when it started doing whatever it’s supposed to be doing but it does do something…you just have to hang in there

So I say ???? you And the wringer You put me through . ???? you And the ledge You lead me to Just ???? you.
174347809,I was in the same boat as you. Then I thought I actually solved my “spiritual” problems and came off meds. I got worse again and realised I had to go back on meds. So I came to the conclusion that schizophrenia is a physical illness of the brain. I still have unusual spiritual beliefs though. That’s my 2 cents.
174347808,Well i have Major Depression and Schizophrenia…so for me it is probably a combination of the two. There are times where i do absolutely nothing because i have no drive or because i feel to miserable to do anything. Hope you are able to move past this.

176023956,"yeah, why is that"
176023957,It’s a gamble. Sometimes you drop dosages or come off the psych meds and you have problems getting back on them. You may need a way higher dose and all the associated drama with side effects etc and you may find they don’t work as well or if at all… Everyone has the same issue when on psych meds and it’s not unusual but you should trust your doctor some and keep looking for better function even on the meds.

176023959,"Nobody is saying you can just one day decide not to be sick anymore. It doesn’t work like that. But you CAN work on making small changes that snowball into bigger changes, and improve your life significantly from where you were. Meds are an important part of the puzzle, but they aren’t the only piece. Forming good habits DOES change the shape of your brain in a real, measurable way over time. It isn’t necessarily a cure, at least not today, but it can improve things significantly."

176023966,"I suffered several psychotic episodes over a period of four years. All this time I kept arguing that there was nothing wrong with me, and I believed that the mental health authorities and my parents were just hospitalising me because they feared my presence. I felt like everyone was against me, and that people were using the label of mental health to cover for their ill wishes. After my third psychotic episode, out of nowhere, I realised I was seriously ill and I complied with my treatment. I started taking Olanzapine Today, I have full control of my mind - no delusions, no voices, nothing at all that bothers me However I feel I have ‘lost’ a lot - I feel I lost my personality. I no longer feel like the charismatic young man I was. My ability to sense energies and situations is absent. I used to love mathematics and the sciences, and I scored very highly on all college exams but I can no longer appreciate the beauty of mathematics. Since I’ve been on this medication I can’t seem to operate

Does anyone else feel like this illness robs you of your entire mind and personality? I feel mentally stuck, I can’t start positive routines or actions? It feels like a permanent padlock on my brain"
176023967,Thanks for listening my problems with patience for years… It helped me not to burst at my family…
176023968,"Can you look for a roommate? I’m not sure what you should do, but I’d like to read the advice you’re given"
176023969,Because the family relative who got me into the job blabbed about my illness to other co-workers.
174347816,i tried many times but cant that’s the problem…maybe i am supposed to be alone all life long haha
176023970,I talked to my pdoc over the phone today and she said to stay home…
176023971,"Better ask your Dr, he knows more than all of us here. I know nothing about Xeplion and the kidneys."
176023972,Yeah got ptsd too.
176023973,"I’m all for gun ownership rights for sane, law-abiding citizens. (in the US.) Once a person is diagnosed with a mental illness, s/he should not be allowed to own a firearm, since the people who do mass shootings have a track record of being mentally ill."

176023976,"I went to a therapist for a couple months and he acted like I made him uncomfortable and he would always ask me at the end “So do you need to come?” So I let him go, and have a appt with a new psychiatrist in the 4th and hoping it will go well because if it doesn’t my insurance won’t pay for any other one so I’m kinda nervous about meeting him and trusting him enough to talk I always think their going to put me away. It’s very nerve wrecking to start with a new one I hope you find one that is tailor made for you"
176023977,I completely get that
176023978,For me I get suicide thoughts kind of randomly. I just know not to act on them. Idk… I think everyone’s different. If I had homicidal urges I’d check myself in… You’re probably the best judge of you tho. Or if your not ask someone who is. IMO
176023979,"No, I’m pretty open about it. It’s a big part of my life, and I’d like to think that it’s helping to break the _USER_ID_"
176023980,"If I remember right, he released a gospel album a few years back. Must be a large part of his life. Good story _NAME_!"
174347824,It is hard to say-- A Psychiatrist would be your best counsel. You could have delusions. This would be most likely because of Schizophrenia.
174347814,I like her way of showing different perspectives. Even the ones that many people in the mental health field dont want to see. I wonder about the book.
176023981,"I have a large patch of hypersenstive skin that is painful to touch. It is not inflamed or itchy. It just hurts to touch. It is not an agonising pain, but rather a small wincing pain and a litlle bit nagging. This is not the first time I have a sensitive patch of skin, but this one is larger and by my backside and upper leg making it awkward to sit. I looked it up as any internet hypochondriac does and this could be related to fibromyalgia. Something called allodynia. Can anybody relate to this? I mean could it be related to my paliperidone?"
176023982,Dr _NAME_ either sensationalizes people’s misery for tv ratings or he raises public awareness of taboo topics.
176023983,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ I appreciate your support. I’m glad I reached out to the forum to get it off my chest and come clean. I’ve decided not to tell my husband. He doesn’t need to worry about me any more than he already has had to over the last 10 years. I’m just gonna let this one pass by and tomorrow start clean again. I feel physically ill. The norco is giving me a bad tummy ache and I figure that’s my karma for over-indulging. I don’t want a repeat and feel really done with the whole thing. I think I’ve learned my lesson and feel safe that I won’t repeat the same mistake tomorrow. I feel strong now, resolved as you said."
176023984,"I’ve looked into to. I receive ssdi but under $900/month. it is possible to receive ssdi and ssi at the same time if you have under $2000 dollars in resources and are paying rent. I will apply for ssi by the end of the summer. im currently under $2000, and pay $500/month in rent. leaving me only enough money left over for groceries and little else. it’s worth a shot I figure but I can’t save my money over $2000 or else I would lose ssi."
176023985,Im debating whether to goto the ER - and get my jab. I really dont think i can stand another crappy night with me paranoia - and jumping out my skin everytime a car horn goes off. My coping skills seem to have bogged off. “vicky” has been taunting me as well. I would probably be alright - if i had someone sit with me and keep me company and distract me. But im a _NAME_ no mates (thru choice in the past) and simply dont know anyone anymore. Im sure the Quetiapine aint working no more - or its not working as well without me jab to compliment it. Ive been doing so well lately as well
176023986,"it would have been picked up by now, i have been checked with an endoscope and all they said was i had constipation (which i didnt think i have) i just tense my stomach up because of stress which probably tightens everything up but i guess its made it stick out idk"
176023987,Great photos. They make me feel good.
176023988,"I had some reservations about coming back on the forum. What happened about two years ago might have been me having some hypomania or even narcissism by proxy as I think my behaviour mostly was rather attention-seeking. I really hope I’m making a positive experience for not just myself, but everyone here, without being so over-the-top. I’d like to think I’m here to stay."
174347815,"_AT_MENTION_ I think its the Glycine giving me energy. I had a burst of energy yesterday night but now its gone in the morning. Yesterday I really wanted to do things like reading, audiobooks, bicycle, talking with my family, etc It reduced my anhedonia and improved motivation a bit. When I was working on Latuda I was taking 20-30g Glycine powder daily. Stopped it due to nausea. Yesterday took 3 pills x2, today I am taking 4 pills x2. I didn’t take carnosine today as I am pretty sure its the Glycine. Let see if I get the energy burst again. The burst of energy happened after my second dose at night so Glycine blood levels must have been higher. But the energy burst is still not as strong as Abilify for me. Did you try Glycine?"
176023989,"In the next world, I hope to have a pet white tiger. And a pet baby lamb. And they will play with each other, gently. And I’ll have all the cats that I’ve ever owned, back at my side. And I will be a supremely confident piano virtuoso. And I will accompany an orchestra. And I will have my strong, capable, sz free, son back in my arms. That is my dream."
176023990,Yes I don’t know how some people can take half of their dose in the morning.
176023991,"Seriously though, I know the feeling. I don’t watch T.V. often either…not because it makes me paranoid but because I can’t concentrate on/can’t get into the plots/just don’t enjoy it. Sucks because TV is an easy way to pass the time when your able."
176023992,How extreme were your past delusions? And when you talk to someone how does that help?
176023993,collecting and caring for bonsai trees
176023994,No problem. Have good day no worries.
174347826,"Daily Essential Nutrients is helping with a 150% dose, I take it like 5-5-5-6 capsules. I will drop back to 4-4-4 since I am taking Vit C/no flush niacin though. Based on my research I believe it is healing my weak/permeable blood brain barrier, which is in turn reducing the level of chronic brain inflammation happening. There is not much Vitamin C or Niacin in it so it is isn’t antipsychotic per se, it is just facilitating healing of a damaged system which seems to cause schizophrenia."

176024003,Honestly I’ll be dead so I don’t care what happens. Write anything on it.

176024020,"Since learning I am not going to graduate on time because my TB test results were turned in 3 days past the deadline even though my last year’s TB test hadn’t yet expired. I feel like I am being overly punished for a basic mistake. I did not check my email for a couple weeks while I was dealing with serious health issues because I was going to doctor’s appts sorting out new meds etc. It was a lot to deal with and the first time I’d really had time to deal with it since I am on break now. And not checking my email because I just didnt think about it with all that was going on cost me dearly because I missed the email about the deadline. I do not feel my school is handling this well at all. I already had positions for my clinicals. I already passed all my background checks etc. And now they’re just going to say I can’t do any of it even though my TB test results have been confirmed now and I already have the positions? So now I have to lose out on job opportunities (I had an interview I w
as really excited for) and be stuck living at my parents house for who knows how much longer? I wanted to get engaged to my boyfriend after graduating and now that will be postponed as well? This is just absolutely miserable. I have been paralyzed since this occurred struggling to function. I emailed the _NAME_ about it who took a week to get back to me, literally waiting until the day the university closed, and then when I responded to her asking questions and about a time to meet up I just got the canned university is closed I’ll get back to you in 3 weeks happy holidays message. How am I supposed to have a happy holidays with this hanging over my head? To me it signifies such a lack of caring on her part that is frankly infuriating to me. I’m just feeling so down right now guys please wish me luck."

176024063,I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine the struggle with MD. Do you use a wheelchair? Would giving your body a break from the effort it takes just to e walk around help? Or would that just lead to faster atrophy? I know for me it really helps to use my wheelchair on my bad days. Otherwise I’m useless the rest of the day just from checking the mail.

174347856,"An inserted thought is when most often a sz patient believes a thought enters the mind from another agency. ’ Thought insertion ’ in schizophrenia involves somehow experiencing one’s own thoughts as someone else’s. Some philosophers try to make sense of this by distinguishing between ownership and agency: one still experiences oneself as the owner of an inserted thought but attributes it to another agency."" An intrusive thought is a thought that one has that causes distress that often gets stuck in the mind. As you believe (wrongly) that your thought comes from an alien then it is an inserted thought. Taking away your belief in aliens possessing your mind is probably unpersuadable to you, but it is your belief that sways the definition."

So she had great results in cycling lithium once a week. I’ll post the video, I watched it years ago. A little goes a long way with lithium. I have some lithium aspatate in the freezer from years back which I’ve been saving to try, and I took one an hour ago. But only once a week I’ll take it. Talk to your doctor before taking it.

Keeping my distance is the best thing I have done over the last 6 years after my last friends left me alone. When I had friends at school, they got me into drugs and that was bad. Then I made some new friends, and they ditched me when I was left psychotic for over a year, and I was acting out. At no point did they take me to hospital. Must have seen it as a joke. Anyways, my advice is to trust those you can rely on, and keep a safe level of trust with anyone else. If you don’t invest your loyalty and trust heavily in people, you can’t be let down. It’s better to do this than have an unhealthy hate that boils up inside and makes you more distressed and upset."

To be honest, it’s the physical disease that destroyed me, not psychosis. Sz is a medical illness, and so is my physical disease. It’s just of the mind. You have an extra burden to carry but that agony is not in vain. Your suffering is not in vain- and I’m sure your brothers and parents would love to have you."

176024159,A short video clip about online brain training for Sz patients. Worth a look. The training is available at www.brainhq.com
174347880,"I had a low 2 point ish GPA or something in high school (underachiever, I guess – hated school a lot never studied – ditched and was depressed and bullied). I went to community college at 17 or 18 years old and got a 3.89 UC gpa and a 3.9 CSU gpa. I transferred to a top UC (got in all of them that I applied to) with excellent ECs and work experience and awards and scholarships. Then I switched from economics ba to math ba and my life went spiraling down. I wasn’t smart enough or prepared really. I was slow, stupid, prodromal symptoms, cognitive decline, studying too hard and not studying smart, partying a bit, poor, and stressed to the core. I also lacked female relationships and was slightly made fun of constantly and was failing tests and almost failed courses. Was thinking of changing majors after abstract algebra or probability class and thinking of doing a non-stem degree like history or latin/greek studies or some ????????. I could have dropped out and went back, but then things changed
. I started posting stuff about my thoughts, beliefs, and experiences and what I been through and remembered. I’m embarassed and I believe people know what’s going on with me. I will never go back for sure. Basically, I got into UCLA and UC Berkeley and chose Berkeley. I missed the deadline for ROTC full ride. I then got deathly sick from schizophrenia and pot in a bad environment. I think powerful grey aliens are ??????? with my life. Sending me back in time through wormholes or causal loops and even trapped now in a time loop by nordic aliens. I believe I have trauma but I think some of it was grey aliens too. I don’t know. It’s a good thing I didn’t join. I would have had to drop out, repay the scholarship, etc. I would have joined the Navy or air force. I had a problem with energy drinks and I could barely pass a pe course. After my bad trip, I stayed away. I think I could have got hurt or something. I don’t know. I ended up physically fat and weak from poor decisions like eating mcdonalds sev
eral times a day for a month or so based on bad advice. I used to be strong in high school and community college and was athletic. People thought something was wrong with me but it was always my autism and stuff. Part of me thinks I was in the military in a past life or parallel universe or even Berkeley’s ROTC program (possibly Navy) but I ended up dropping out. I remember going through a wormhole back in time. I talk a lot of ???? and get no money or benefits. It happened a trillion or so lifetimes ago. I went crazy or insane in my original life. Maybe it’s wishful thinking or a dream that I wish I made it. Seems like time travel or consciousness transfer back in time by grey aliens. Then I was blind and thought about joining the marines back in time for government benefits, but probably didn’t. Like a do-over in life. I always end up schizophrenic. Even went back in time to prevent or try to prevent the smoking of marijuana but something happened and the memories didn’t come back fast enough. It’
s like I smoked pot to fit in or to relax or to have sex… I never got any benefits and probably was a bad idea to reincarnate back in time to get government benefits like disability because I’m too disabled and SSI isn’t enough money to live on. I had this rare ability to time travel back in time and change my life or reincarnate like an immortal time traveler. Some celebrities and royalty have it I think according to the internet/youtube. Anyways that’s my story. Now, I’m stuck in a causal loop for eternity or time loop and I keep waking up severely dissociated and schizophrenic around 2013 I think forever like the universe keeps coming back for infinity…"
176024160,Anyone dealt with this. I’m unable to eat anything my family makes and it is getting expensive. I eat mostly packaged food.
176024161,"I think the stress/anxiety thing is the biggest obstacle we have to face especially regarding work. I honestly don’t know how this can be completely overcome because even people who don’t have this illness usually feel stress around there job. It’s just an unpleasant fact of life. For example I am working at a job teaching English as a second language in a foreign country. The job itself isn’t/shouldn’t be that stressful and I know a lot of people would laugh if they told them I was anxious about the job, if they experienced that it’s actually pretty easy. I think taking care of your overall physical health and getting regular exercise can help reduce stress."

176024165,That what I understood …
176024166,"I can relate to this a lot, especially from when I worked in an office. It used to be incredibly tiring when I had to explain things that are simple to me in terms of getting the picture, but complex to others. Lost count of how many times I used to have to go over things in such detail, when if I was just able to produce the work, it would have been done much, much quicker. This skill works well for me from a planning perspective, but as soon as you start adding in people from other areas, things get super complicated really quickly. A few times I got in trouble for being rude to people on email especially, as it used to frustrate me so much dealing with the stupidity of others who make mistakes, as I frequently had to give up my weekends to fix serious issues with the companies software portal caused by carelessness. (_PERSON_ may be the wrong word, but I was to blunt and direct - was told off for this for my whole 6 years with that company!) Never got one apology for it, people expected me to fi
x stuff even though I had much higher level work to do than focusing on operational problems. Now I will be continuing my self-employment, and not have to deal with other people so much. I admit the company could have its benefits sometimes, but now I am in control of my own projects, and I do the best job I can for my customers - without all the background pain of office politics!"

176024180,I don’t know. I prefer to live.
176024181,During an episode the hallucinations can be so intense and convincing that you might have seen and heard things (like your friend telling you weird stuff) that didn’t actually happen. Best bet: keep taking your meds and avoid stressful situations or other known triggers (like an old flame who left you for another) whenever possible.
176024182,"I went with my kids to see a Pokémon movie today. It was a remake of the first Pokémon movie, with exactly the same plot. The only difference was that it was made using Pixar-like CG rather than drawn anime pictures. The overall theme focused upon conflict between clones/copies and the real thing, and it felt to be, like other Pokémon movies, and the whole Pocket Monster theme, to be related to the topic of this thread, except made cuter, in a typical Japanese way. The CG version that I saw is not in English yet but the original, from 1998 has an English language trailer. It has a happy end."

176024190,"I wouldn’t invite strangers into my house, for the record, whether I live with people or alone. Also, I’m not into casual sex anymore or stranger sex, if there’s a difference. My private parts can’t take it lol"
176024191,"My college piano teacher said, “Most of the co-eds just want to find a husband, get married and raise a raft of children. But you’re different.” I already felt like a misfit and that didn’t help any. But it was true. When I was little, the dream mother put in my head was about going to college. As if it was a thing in itself. No life before and no life after. Really, it taught me a very limited idea of life."
176024192,You are amazing _AT_MENTION_ ! Almost 100 lbs. lost! That is incredible!!! I wish I could get “addicted to the crunchiness” of veggies. The crunchiness is exactly what I don’t like about raw veggies. They take too long to eat in my book. That’s why I much prefer well cooked and seasoned veggies over raw.
176024193,Ok _AT_MENTION_. Your answer did not help me much but thank you for your reply.
176024194,Does it go to the last web page you are on instead of loading? I am having those problems with Firefox.
176024195,I’ve just recently taking a look at the creative section again that I’ve neglected
176024196,I wear my sz pride shirt and work for a mental health organization working towards battling _USER_ID_ and other barriers to treatment.
176024197,I would love to have you over. You’re welcome anytime.
176024198,UK schools are closing from Friday now. Hopefully I can scrape through my college interview.
176024199,"No one at my Church (parish), ever asks or has asked me about my job or what job I retired from or asks if I am married or even dating anyone. Never. As a matter of fact no one ever does, not even outside the Church. Am I that obviously MI that people just assume I don’t have all these things?"
174347888,"It’s hard to lose weight on APs, But I’ve had success with diet and exercise. However, I’m on Abilify. I think _AT_MENTION_ is on Haldol and has had significant weight loss. We’ll see if she has something to say, I tagged her."
176024200,I get suspended when the wind blows. I’ve lost count of how many times. It’s usually because I don’t suffer fools very easily…and tell it like it is.
174347889,They can lower the seizure threshold but unsure about clozapine. I had a gran mal but it was related to me stopping xanax abruptly. I wasn’t on a lot either…it was like 2-3 mgs a day. Your medical team will work it out. I went through a ton of tests etc. I know it’s not easy but stay in the system and see what turns up. You really need to follow through to rule out other things as well…
176024201,You’re known for your humorous anecdotes and helpful stories. A good attitude goes a long ways. Congrats on the sobriety. “Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue.”
176024202,I live with my wife. Used to be my wife and son and all my sons friends. My wife really misses having kids around.
176024203,He has agents and emissaries. So he might not be the devil but my boyfriend the fallen angel is an agent of his.
176024204,I´m glad you didn´t _AT_MENTION_!
176024205,"oh I don’t know, my husband keeps it locked up with the rest of the meds. It’s just little red pills. I’ll find out later what mg it is I guess"
176024206,Yes because people online just call me ocd so i think its that never hallucinated so
176024207,I had serious suicidal thoughts during my divorce. Had thoughts about jumping off a cliff but backed out of it. I was severely depressed during this time.
176024208,"Thanks dude _PERSON_ at home, I’m on my lunchbreak. How are you?"
176024209,How many times can We say toaster? The word has lost all meaning
176024210,"I have dealt with this, even to the point of hospitalized supervised water restriction. I’ve heard that it’s unlikely to occur outside a medical condition or severe mental illness, even specifically schizophrenia. So, I was curious if others here have battled with it?"
176024211,Someone you barely knew
176024212,close to symptom free on invega still get paranoid sometimes but its been a while since the voices have been bad
176024213,I used to really suffer from catastrophic thinking and excessive worrying. It’s kind of stopped lately.
176024214,You are not an attention seeker I just feel you aren’t getting the answers you want to hear but we can only tell you what we feel… I think the most important thing is to focus on the symptoms forget the diagnosis as it does not matter that much at the moment…
176024215,"You’ll be ok, just relax… We are all very real and not in the matrix, everyone here has free will"
174347887,So it probably is the abilify then. Ugh lol well hopefully they can just decrease the dose because I think the hospital went over board with the dose trying to get me stablized.
176024216,No I’m not. I’ve become quite cold and uncaring. This is squarely due to the fact that I was left high and dry when I most needed help. My motto now is “The more help you need the less you get The less help you need the more you get” That’s the way it’s been for me.
176024217,"I stupidly listened to the radio which I haven’t done for 10 months. I began reading double/ triple meanings into songs and lyrics…getting mixed messages, etc. How am I supposed to live if I can’t even listen to music or test social media? This is the only forum I come to now. I’m in a box and I swear I’m going to crack pretty soon again. Or perhaps I’m cracking up right now. It sure feels like it."
176024218,But I do have insight to realise I’m not delusional There’s a very small chance of me being delusional but i think im not
176024219,"Not sure if this will help, but when I was about 4 years old, my older brothers used to gang up on me and do whatever mean things they could to make me cry. They would pursue it until they got the satisfaction of me crying to my mom, which didn’t take too long, and my parents did nothing to stop them anyway. My mom told me that she couldn’t be there to protect me 24/7 so she needed me to learn to protect myself. How? By not reacting to them, or engage with them no matter what. They were only looking and loving a reaction from me, and the more I cried, the more thrilled they were to know they bothered me. To get them to stop, I just had to learn to not respond to anything they did. Took a lot of practice, but they eventually grew bored with me not crying and moved on to torturing someone/thing else."
176024220,I don’t understand. Why do you want to get worse?
176024221,"I’m a recovering alcoholic. I drank quite a bit while I was on med’s, and I’m sure it caused damage. I don’t think a small glass of wine will hurt you, but I absolutely would not want to make it any more than that."
174347882,"My pdr is saying that how come I have the energy to know a lot about medicine, the brain and schizophrenia from reading medical articles online and having the energy to post here but I am unable to get out of bed. He doesnt understand."
176024222,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ ! The strawberry was actually my first attempt of a semi-realistic digital drawing, so I’m quite proud of it"
176024223,"A lot of us struggle with weight. Don’t worry about that now; keep doing what you are doing to stay healthy. That is what really matters. As for your grief, I agree with _AT_MENTION_ that it is natural to feel this way after losing someone. Were you close to your dad? If so, the loss can be tremendous. If not, there is always the question of what might have been. Give yourself time."
176024224,lol cold shower reminds me of the time i was in boot camp in the army for some months and just to mess with us they cut of the hot water so we had to take cold showers.
174347893,It’s not the guy in the distance. You’re hearing voices due to schizophrenia. I’m sorry you’re still suffering _NAME_.
176024225,I am full of it! Ha sorry _AT_MENTION_!
176024226,What is your dose of invega?
176024227,"You’re not going to be able to raise money until you have listeners in the hundreds of thousands. 5K listeners a month isn’t going to buy a cup of coffee. I think you’ve got inflated ideas of what is possible with a small amount of listeners. First the content, then the audience, then the fundraising. Voicemeeter is donationware, you decide what you’re paying for it."
176024228,"Yeah, that’s a good thing that you were not able to cut deep. Try not to listen to the voices. Cutting yourself doesn’t solve anything. Sorry you had to go through this."
176024229,Funny thing was I thought they were tracking me through ciggies. _PERSON_ smoked one in 5 years cause of that fear I used to have. Suppose I can call that healthy paranoia haha
174347878,"If u are still with a cpn and you still struggle and can get them to write a supporting statement u might be OK. We can still get pip even if working, as long as life is affected Their supporting statements make a lot of difference"
176024230,You underestimate the lack of social skills and that some autistic individuals are also prone to aggression. Anti-psychotics are sometimes used to treat autistic people.
176024231,It happened when I was an infant but it hurts to this day. A doctor burned off a hemangioma. Ouch.
176024232,I doubt most people hate you. The fact is most people are probably indifferent to you like we are to most people. You need to stop caring what people think though. Look at all the people on this forum that come out in support of you. They don’t hate you. Not everyone hates you.
176024233,"I think pharmaceutical companies, as well as psychiatrist are only concerned with bringing symptoms under control. They really don’t know what causes it, or at least their information seems to be sketchy at best"
176024234,Are you safe? If you are suicidal please tell someone. That’s serious stuff. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_
176024235,"Hooray! She responded right back, just now! I have an interview this week!!!"
176024236,_AT_MENTION_. That’s what I thought too. Are you a drinker?
176024237,That’s amazing _AT_MENTION_. The figures are so dynamic and fluid.
176024238,Nothing cool about it – for me it’s psychological torture
176024239,"I started ignoring them when I realised they talked utter crap, very rarely one of them will say something of value"
176024240,"I had quit alcohol(10 years till present) and smoke(6 years), In this span of 6 years was very productive life even though some symptoms, but was not so severe."
174347896,My mom has sz and I’m the oldest child. But no one else has history of mental illness
176024241,"He called me over yesterday to come see “HIS” vegetables for his garden he’s starting and he surprised me with it. It’s like a miniature lily of some kind. I can’t remember or pronounce it’s name. But it matches the big lily he got me for my birthday last year. They look fantastic together. Yellow flowers. They big lily will have yellow flowers when it starts blooming in July. That was so sweet of him. We all agreed to keep her there with _NAME_, the big lily, because I have a tendency to kill outdoor plants."
176024242,"It helps my social anxiety when I talk about the embarrassing thing I did. Then others can assure me they have also done embarrassing things and everyone is usually so worried overthinking about their own embarrassing moments that they don’t have time to think of other people’s. And when they do, it makes them feel better about their own embarrassing things. I will share an embarrassing moment with you about me working as a waiter. I spilled a drink all over a customer when I tripped. Not just water, it was iced tea. I was so humiliated. Thankfully, the customer was chill about it, and did not yell at me. But I couldn’t sleep that night because I kept fretting that I would get fired over it. I ended up quitting that job in a few weeks anyways, because I moved away. Another thing that helps me is thinking about the likely outcomes of a scenario. In your example, suppose a customer did overhear you make that joke and leave a bad review. What is the worst thing that would happen? Probably your m
anager reminding you not to make jokes in front of customers. It would be fine. You won’t lose your job over making a joke that got taken wrong. You will survive this incident."
176024243,I went to grocery today with my dad. As we were leaving a guy behind me said thats not her dad she’s a hoe.
176024244,My grandmother died from alzheimers slowly. I dont want to go like that. I would choose to die younger if its painless.
176024245,Thank you. You are very kind
176024246,Didn’t do shít for me. May as well have been a tictac.
176024247,I’m not fussed all I want is to be well and get a part time job
176024248,… I feel like you aren’t understanding my problem. I’m literally saying it sucks to get interrupted. Like its just courtesy to not talk over people. Like yeah it happens especially since we have such a big group. But honestly there were times where it was just like dude let me finish my sentence
176024249,"Its ok. You couldn’t help it at the time. And like you say, you’ve come a long way since then"
176024250,"I think there are some on this site, probably some of the people who don’t ever post."
176024251,"I get it. I think luck is a definite factor in how you respond to meds, but there does seem to be a difference in life philosophy between those who are happy with their lives and those who aren’t."
176024252,Pride froze me up like a cube. I could only fail.
174347892,"I had the paranoia issue on olanzipine too. Resperidal helped. Maybe worth a shot? Currently using abilify. It’s okay too, but as has been mentioned, can cause akithisia, excessive impulsiveness and anxiety."
176024253,Probably just a sleeping pill
176024254,"Thanks for your comments _AT_MENTION_ The stress was too much for me to handle, and after my failed suicide attempt on Tuesday, I have a new perspective and I don’t want to feel that way again I was good at my old job, but I was also good at landscaping. We’ll see what happens. I will keep everyone on the board posted, and share some pictures when I build things"
176024255,I think it’s a good idea for you at this time. Blessings.

176024257,I’m a Level 2 licensed insurance broker specializing in solutions for small to medium sized businesses. Now in my fourth year. My boss arranged for me to continue working for them from home rather than lose me when I moved last summer. I’m considered very high performing.
174347894,I’m on an effing ‘sub therapeutic’ 2.5 mg of abilify and I STILL am unable to jog. It shows me that even such low dose is effing powerful.
176024258,I don’t know why but I think you’re not hideous because of that. It’s just nothing if at least this is a problem.
176024259,It’s a horrible feeling. I get it sometimes. Nothing ever happens though.
174347898,Mine are in denial too. They think I just have depression with “tendencies”. Schizophrenia is totally different. My mother regularly encourages me to go off meds and use more holistic methods. It’s ridiculous.

There were more adverse events at 42mg.than at 28 mg. in one trial."
176024265,"I am not saying anyone who can manage is free of problems. This is specifically about depression and anxiety. Something like SZA or SZ is something very clear cut. These things seem wooly in my case. I am not trying to diminish other peoples problems. I would never do that.

176024277,Always found benzo’s good for getting me to sleep but not for long hours. They are curious things though and you may be more susceptible to them. I’d try titrating down. Take a little less and see how you go. For me the best results for sleep I got from just doing regular exercise…I’ve moved from sleeping 10 hours a day to 8 or less. Just exercise. I gave up benzo’s years ago after having a gran mal from stopping xanax abruptly. That wasn’t fun and I found other methods for dealing with anxiety and I think my sleep improved more from regular exercise!

Certain people or groups have just presented themselves on earth but they are really ancient aliens / God’s people. I am able to manage all other aspects of my life expect I harp on this topic and people argue with me. I have gotten angry when they will not listen but I have learned to just let them come to their own realization of enlightenment.

I try to remind myself suicide is selfish/and extremely emotionally manipulative. Many victims falsely think you get to peer down and watch things unfold after you’re gone, and that doesn’t help. I recently took in Dead Poet’s Society and the son gets back at his old man by using his gun. But it’s a heartbreaking reaction that both parents have.

174347909,"CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that L - theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia . ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of L-theanine on glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neuropsychiatrica , Oct 2015 Glutamatergic dysfunction in the brain has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was 
added to the patients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect."

174347916,"One of the concerns with sz is that psychosis can tend to hit right when you feel your life is taking off. There are delusions of grandeur involved a lot of the time, I’m not saying this is happening in your case but it’s something to watch out for. Feelings like you’re “destined for success” or like you’re the “chosen one” can quickly escalate into something that can really mess one’s life up. Do you have telepathic delusions? I say delusions specifically. I know we can call them beliefs but do you believe people are able to communicate telepathically with you but are denying it in order to achieve some end goal? For me this is the clincher. I did thought experiments and determined that telepathy was not happening but my brain will not let it go. I can consciously block myself from obsessing about it when medicated but otherwise it’s a mess. If you have that then you have sz in my opinion. But if you can function without meds, well. You may be functioning but you might be even 
higher functioning on meds, or reverse, it’s a tricky misunderstood condition. Time will tell, if you’re in your early twenties as most are when it hits you may have a psychotic episode. Those are terrible, but fun, but terrible. Idk. Be careful is all I’m saying."

176024338,"I don’t think people hate sz’s, but there has been and always will be a fear of the unknown. A lot of prejudice has been broken down with time for example when it comes to sexual identity and racial stuff. That is kind of easy in comparison to sz because it just relates to the fact that people should not be prejudiced for being who they are. What makes sz a little different is that people can’t really relate to what it means unless they have experienced it personally. That is not their fault. I remember before I got my first episode I always thought that having a mental illness like sz or psychosis equalled being crazy all the time and being totally unpredictable. I didn’t know anybody personally who had it either, so I couldn’t relate. Now that I have had the illness myself for over 10 years I realize that it’s more about having bad spells and falling out with reality. Having sz just means that it’s hard to be present in reality all the time, it doesen’t mean that we are bad or evi
l or want to hurt anyone deliberate. But things are definitly moving in the right direction when it comes to making mental illness more understandable for those who don’t have it.

I told him a few years later that the diagnosis was wrong so I could be around the family again. I don’t talk about anything with my family that I’m told by my psychiatrist is psychotic.

176024432,"Love is a nebulous concept, often twisted around. It is the crux of worldviews and should be defined well. A well established love isn’t just superficial “good feelings”. There is a depth to it you can’t summarize with soundbites. My best definition is actions conducive to the betterment of others, but not necessarily geared towards immediate approval. If you want immediate approval you just reinforce social norms and get a pat on the back. But that seems like low effort virtue signaling. Doesn’t amount to much. Intelligent love may require distance from the masses, to better and more honestly guide and orient your moral compass, free from the distractions of overriding political / peer pressure. Because if you set that compass to random, average people, you will become exactly that."

174347951,"I’ve been on 1 tablet a day of Mushroom Wisdom’s ‘Super’ Lion’s Mane for about a month now. Within the last week, I described some of my hero-name ‘delusions’ to my psychologist. I included many of them leading up to psychosis and many of the present ones. He didn’t seem very concerned, and basically asked me to focus on how to improve my career, and to not define myself with a negative label like ‘schizophrenia.’ I believe I’m still doing well at the same job that I’ve had for over 2 years. So, the Lion’s Mane, and the additional neuroplasticity, does not seem to be making me delusional. Still no hallucinations. If the first test of a self-treatment is ‘do no [serious] harm,’ maybe it passes so far. Thanks for starting the thread _AT_MENTION_"

176024448,"Dear _PERSON_ , you often posted about hearing voices when you were on medication. I think it is common knowledge that hearing voices is a major symptom of Sz or Sza. So you’d better stay on medication. However you can ask your Pdoc to switch meds if you are not happy about the medication you are currently on."

I tried multiple times and always gave up because the beginning was too hard. It just shows you how intelligence can fluctuate intensely from schizophrenia.

I’m just not sure if my symptoms are leaning towards schizophrenia . I will ask doc but these medications, are not usually prescribed for somataform disorder is what I gathered from just reading up on somataform disorder on the web. Thanks for your thoughts. Hope you feel better soon."
174347997,"Synchronicities are sometimes real events, but when a person is schizophrenic, they happen to an exaggerated degree, mainly due to the sufferer’s compromised mentality looking for synchronicities where there are none, due to a declining mental state compelling the subconscious to look for answers in the environment for why the person is suffering."

174348005,Zoloft combines with naltrexone to make me not drink. When I was on naltrexone alone not only did I have depression but still drank 15-20 beers per week but since adding Zoloft. I have maybe drank 4-5 beers total in 2+ years. And no depression anymore. It also seems to help my cognitive skills. When I stopped it I had terrible brain zaps and anxiety. Zoloft is a miracle!! Not as much a miracle as naltrexone and abilify. But nevertheless. A freaking muricle!!!

Vitamin B(6) is a potent antioxidant and takes part in almost all of the possible mechanisms that are suggested as being associated with appearance of TD. The aims of this study were (1) to reexamine the efficacy and safety of higher doses of vitamin B(6) versus placebo in a greater sample of patients for a longer time and (2) to evaluate the carryover effect of vitamin B(6).A 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic from August 2002 to January 2005 on 50 inpatients with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and TD. In a doub
le-blind crossover paradigm, all study subjects were randomly assigned to start treatment with either vitamin B(6) (daily dose of 1200 mg) or placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment and then a 2-week washout, subjects were crossed over to receive the other treatment for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in Extra-pyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) scores.The mean decrease in ESRS clinical global impression scores from baseline to endpoint was 2.4 points in patients treated with vitamin B(6) and 0.2 points in patients treated with placebo (p < .0001). The mean decrease in the parkinsonism subscale score was 18.5 points and 1.4 points, respectively (p < .00001), and the mean decrease in the dyskinesia subscale score was 5.2 points and -0.8 points, respectively (p < .0001).Vitamin B(6) appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of TD. The specific mechanisms by which vitamin B(6) attenuates symptoms of TD are not clear. I don’t have TD but I do have high levels of iron in my b

176024671,Ok that helps clarify.Very confusing for me. Your recovery state sounds like I am but I am functioning higher so I don’t know. Biggest reason I care is because if it is some kind of catatonic state that would be good believe it or not because then that would mean there may actually be some change for once with the TMS or ECT. Thanks for your reply. _AT_MENTION_

176024673,"Pfft. My mother was blind. As in had both eyes removed from degradation, two glass eyes, and the world’s stupidest Seeing Eye Dog kind of blind. She would have killed to have the life I’ve had, to be able to work, drive, read normally, SEE. I know that she’d have traded my SZ symptoms for everything else in a heartbeat."
176024674,i think if you move away you will still encounter the same problems…
176024675,"Just my opinion, i could be wrong, but i get the vibe from people that its ok to say what you feel on here. I often forget that we all have an illness on here and are just trying to cope and when we can -help others cope. Speaking for just me, i have zero problems with what you post, nor do i have a problem with anyone on the forum really. Sz.com is probably the nicest forum on the internet."
176024676,"Just follow their instructions, you’re in it now. Just ride it out."
176024677,It might be a good idea to reach out to your psychiatrist if you are feeling that unwell just to be assessed. There might be something they can do to help.
176024678,"I don’t know if it ever helped my symptoms, but the side effects weren’t bad for me as I really never noticed them much. I preferred going in and taking a shot every once in while to taking pills every night too. But, really I would rather not take an AP, but people coerce me into it."
174348037,"I don’t know your situation, but a belief that someone is putting cyanide poison in your food or the poison gas in your room kind of seems like a paranoia. Why did you believe that?

If you believe you were misdiagnosed, then go to another psychiatrist, so you can get more precise diagnosis or go to the psychologist and you both find out."
176024679,I think so too thanks for the answer
176024680,i am willing to improve
176024681,good to hear you feeling a bit better =)
176024682,I’ve started seeing shadow people again. And they watch me all the time. I can’t shake that feeling. Im at work right now and it’s just unbearable. With them watching and the feeling of cameras watching me too. This med switch is awful so far. Idk what to do.
176024683,Yes I get all kinds of bizarre and scary thoughts and images. These intrusive thoughts and images are common with OCD. That can be downright scary!

It was my first time using the expensive lo-dough and to be honest it wasn’t that impressive, but at least it was low cal and a change from wraps!"

176024695,my voices were bad but then I learned to listen to them without reacting like a spiritual practice - soon the vicious commentary had next to no sway on my daily activities
176024696,"If you think you have symptoms you should stay on meds. Perhaps if you believe clozapine isn’t doing the trick, you should research on other meds that you think that is more beneficial and type it out and show it to your doctor to evaluate. And see what he/she says"
176024697,I was spending $300 a month on cigarettes. I’ve been vaping for 6 months. It cures my craving for cigarettes. It was hard to find a flavor I liked. My mom is 62 and has lung cancer. I’m 44 and they found 2 growths in my lungs. They said they were 2mm too small to be considered cancer and to come back for another screening next year. I smoked for 30 years.

176024699,"I do but it’s been a struggle. i am self employed and that works the best for me. I basically work when i feel good. I never really felt like i should be on disability. i remember when i first got on. we had gone out to eat and i had a BIL say sarcastically that they had to pay for me. I had been hallucinating for over a year consistently, hadn’t worked or paid bills, had thousands of debt. I also got criticism for living with my mom and not paying rent even though i couldn’t afford too. also i felt like i had no control over my life. Because i had debt. All my money went to debt. my family basically could tell me what to do and i have no control over any decision. SSDI is very rule based. I didn’t learn enough about it. DONT GO TO DISABILITY101 if you are on SSDI> DON""T GO TO THIS WEBSITE db101(dot) org they try to act like they are for you but their ulterior motive is to get people off disability. i wouldn’t be surprised if it’s run by a conservative type organization."
176024700,"Drs won’t force you to do anything bad,"
176024701,"Then you’re likely unable to do those things because of mental illness, not because of an intellectual disability."
176024702,"Just recognize that anything out of the ordinary probably isn’t real and ignore it for the time being. Just pretend the delusions don’t exist, don’t believe them, ignore them. I know they can’t stop bothering you but by recognizing what wasn’t real I was able to live normally while meds were being switched. You’ll find something that works, sometimes it’s a higher dose that’s needed or two meds together."
176024703,"I know from experience that living in fear can be terrifying. I get more angry at my stalkers these days. Which is probably just as unhealthy. You’re still very young, so hopefully your symptoms will mellow out with age."
176024704,There is yet to be a credible source that provides pure CBD. Everything you find on the internet is either mixed with THC or is hemp based.
176024705,"Same, people say its better for someone to quit but i would rather keep taking coffee its one of the few real pleasures i have, when i dont drink my morning coffee i get a headache."

176024711,Risperidone was an excellent med. Brought me into remission for five years or more. When I eventually relapsed I resumed taking it but stopped because it was expensive. When I went to hospital I could have resumed it but they chose to introduce me to amisulpride. Which worked wonders for me too.

176024734,"I’m trying so hard, but I’ve done some stupid stuff to others when I was ill. That is unacceptable to me to do harm to others. Even with this stupid illness. I cost his family 500 dollars. And I committed suicide 3 times when I was dating him. Do you think that is acceptable to a charming, young, aspiring man who tried his best to help his girlfriend? Absolutely not. What I’ve done is unacceptable. I’m unacceptable. I’m done with myself. At least for now. I don’t exist."

176024737,"I had this feeling of everything being clear and just as it should be, or perhaps as the only way it could be and me fitting perfectly in the slot i should be. Perhaps it is similar. I could not not elaborate it into theses though, and I did not feel the need to. Maybe it’s similar. For me this only lasted an hour or so. Then things went back to ye olde psychotic banality. I suppose it’s possible to stay in that state. To me it’s too risky and I don’t see much value in it, even though it felt like bliss."
174348052,"The schizophrenia diagnosis is withheld for people who don’t present in a violent, imminently dangerous manner. Usually.

176024747,I don’t think I could work full time because even medicated my symptoms will most likely come back again and I may need time off work. So having SSDI income is helpful. I have been hospitalized 5 times for mental illness within the last seven years. I fear it’s bound to happen again. I addition it would give added stress of having to rely on a job for income. Right now I don’t have to rely on my job if something were to happen. Although the extra income does help.

For the last 2 and a half weeks I have plateaued even though I continued to exercise and starve myself. I am at a loss to know what to do as I can’t eat any less and get dizzy from anymore exercise, except try a keto diet for a month and see if that works. Has anyone any experience of this?

To come to the realization that we are spiritual divine entities, and this world isn’t real. To become aware of your own will and self. Products of the chaos experiencing itself through consciousness itself created. I still don’t believe it’s all random, still hard to believe it’s real. We will entropy back into uniformity. Someday this universe, this realm, will end, black hole decay, absolute zero, heat death, even the smallest of things will cease to exhibit the spark. Can I escape in time? Why did I choose this? Why can’t I go home? Why am I still in the light? I want more, I’m both enthralled and nonplussed, depending on the instance. Craving a journey again.

I like to think I’m still intelligent but I have to admit my mental power does seem a bit reduced but that’s because of the anti-psychotic I am on

176024810,"hi. sometimes it seems like people there are purposely hurting my feelings, but in a big way. i come home from work so exhausted. my super and i discussed it and i might get some help with it. i feel so relieved. after all these years of suffering. have they no shame? hurting a person with sz of all things? and cancer? _NAME_"
176024811,Thanks for the compliment _AT_MENTION_ . Glad you like the color scheme
176024812,I’ve been more stressed so my voices have been worse. Been argumentative but since apologizing things have been better
176024813,"I dunno. Groping someone isn’t the greatest thing to do (not the worst, but still pretty crappy). Causing mischief at a mall?..doubt anyone remembers it by now. I wouldn’t worry about it. Unless you’re _NAME_ driving around burying people all over the state, I’d say a lot of actions by the mentally ill can be excused away. Even a lot of victims will understand and reframe the incident in their mind."
176024814,Well there’s no debate on whether or not the inanimate objects can feel it lol

174348073,"I got 10mg Abilify Monday from my PCP. That’s after taking 5mg for three weeks prescribed by my pdoc. I started hearing noises on the 5mg. I’m hoping the 10mg continues to work. I’m seeing a new pdoc July13 who does telehealth. The arthritis in my left leg has gotten worse, and it’s a challenge to walk. When I went from 5mg to 10mg, my leg hurt worse. That, and sleep problems are the only side effects I’m having."
176024816,"I used to take 800 at night. One of the 2, the other thorazine, that helped. Doubled my body weight and was still gaining when they took me off of it. All I wanted to do was eat and sleep."
174348085,"Hey, I couldn’t read through all the comments but I decided to buy this for my occasional positive symptoms. All I heard was that it reduces voices from this thread. Someone care to reply if their negative symptoms have been affected??"
176024817,"Sz raises dopamine and stopping meds raises dopamine even more, thats why psychosis the worst when you stop your meds. Why did you stop your meds?"
174348078,It’s absolutely wise to let go of anything once you have weighed it in the balance. I sure hope I didn’t tAlk you out of something that you might really like to do. It’s just that our illness comes with so much baggage that I don’t want it to come back and haunt you either.
176024818,? m not strong person.i m living for my wife.my only love with me for 22 years.
176024819,I’m not going to the er. I have been nearly a dozen times. My father had his lungs operated on . Had two heartattcks.

176024821,"I feel pretty normal on meds. Off meds I either have brainfog and a lot of symptoms, both positive and negative, or I’m almost manic. On meds I feel alert, present, and relatively normal functioning"
176024822,"On meds I am an atheist. Without meds I think that I am Jesus and that I should kill myself to prove that I am God. I fell to those delusions and nearly died in the emergency from poisoning overdose. They pumped me with an IV antidote as they said my liver is failing and that I would need a liver transplant if my parents brought me late to the emergency or if they came home late that day. I was vomitting for an hour, at home, in the car, in the street and in the hospital."
176024823,"Last time I had an intense issue with my heart being controlled by the voices was the last time I smoked weed. That put me off massively. Sucks, as I used to enjoy smoking it!"

176024826,I believe I was targeted unfairly. I dont want to talk about it. But it saddens me dearly. My life was destroyed and no one cares except this forum. I tried getting help for 10 years man. The world is unfair and sucks. Even aliens lie.
174348075,"sza, saphris, rexulti, Topamax and Cymbalta. That’s the bad thing about sza is there’s usually a cocktail that goes along with it. But I do pretty good. How about you? You doing pretty good? Any breakthrough symptoms?"

176024828,its alright move to Kansas.
174348076,It makes me so frustrated when I tell my pdoc about the side effects I’m experiencing from the medicine and they just say it’s negative symptoms of sz. I am so positive it’s the meds.
176024829,"I don’t leave my house, and I have no reason to. Everything I need I get delivered or my wife gets like meds, though the pharmacy delivers too I like to drive too. I have a sports car. But it just sits in the garage going up in value."
176024830,"I don’t like watching videos of people with SZ, it’s just depressing to me. I’ll read some books on SZ anecdotes as research for my recovery book though."
176024831,"When I was a teen, my heart started beating so hard it scared me. My mother called the doctor and he told her to give me one of her tranquilizers. It worked. I wonder if that didn’t start my long dependency on pdocs. This morning, I noticed me heart was beating fast and it started to scare me. It’s only my mind remembering something scary or fearing something scary and so I was able to avoid asking for help. I feel this is a big step in the right direction. I also found I could breathe deeper with this new self control."
176024832,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ 1515
176024833,"_AT_MENTION_ That is a GREAT opportunity! It will be excruciatingly painful, but you will have so much love and support from others. You will also be able to come alongside other strugglers and help them to heal, and that will fulfill you as well."

176024838,"I’ve been on Lithium, Depakote, and Lamictal. I am on Lamictal now and hated the others. Lamictal can cause a rare rash and might cause you to feel more stimulated I think. I like it a lot. Helps with my DP/DR and mood."
176024839,I remember having symptoms as early as 16 but psychosis didn’t sink in until 20.
176024840,"If she doesn’t have an office, I guess texting is the best way to get in touch. In that case, I’d text her."
176024841,tbh imo all people with psychotic symptoms should actually do all tests like blood tests/ stool tests/ ct scan/ mri/ x-ray just to rule out the possibility before having any Ap treatments bc i honestly think there is a pathogen making our brains go wrong no matter parasite / virus etc. Our brains wouldn’t just suddenly go wrong out of no reasons
176024842,Metformin is being recalled due to cancer risk so be careful don’t risk it for weight gain only if you have diabetes

176024850,I don’t know how long I’ve had fat surrounding my organs (gallbladder liver) But I just found out about it through an ultrasound recently.
176024851,"yeah, but for Everyone, though. When a person asks you, could be anywhere you go, How ya doing? Most people respond with, Good."
176024852,"I would suggest adding an antidepressant. They’re are a ton of options. There’s also a blood test you can have dinner to see which ones will work best for you if you want to skip to the end. Meanwhile, I suggest getting a therapist. Look up mindfulness and practice that. Journal and list your 3 favorite things about each day. Mantras work for some people, you could try that. More than anything, though, you shouldn’t try to be happy. You should aim for content. No one is always happy and having that be your goal is unrealistic."
176024853,"You really need to stop the street drugs, coke, etc Its likely making you psychotic and worse as they boost dopamine and antipsychotics block dopamine."

176024858,I’m sorry. I think you’re pretty awesome. I can always count on you to make me laugh. That’s gotta count for something. Sorry you’re not as appreciated in the real world as you deserve to be.
176024859,I’m not harassing anyone intentionally.
174348093,Reminds me of that famous joke by the Marx Brothers: “I’d never want to belong to a club who would have someone like me for a member.”

176024865,"I do wonder if I didn’t do drugs and alcohol if I would not have got psychotic. I guess I will never know it is to do with serious stress over a prolonged period or maybe serious acute stress It can be predisposed by genetics, at leas one of my uncles had it There are studies that in a sub group of szc people, gluten can be involved. possibly even casein. both two very addictive things hard to take out the diet."
174348101,"I met my wife off meds,after we dated for a year,I went back on meds consistently,which I will face difficulty getting off them one again. I took fish oil,melatonin as a replacement for antipsychotic as I had been on meds for so many years…my brain need time to adjust to its natural system again.The supplement could help,or maybe just placebo effect"
176024866,Recorded 3 3minute long guided meditations for myself.
176024867,It’s just a delusion. Why are you so special the government would want to spy on you? Are you a KGB agent? My guess is no. So why would it be worth their time to take pictures and follow you?
176024868,"That’s what I feared. Still, I’ll give it a chance."

176024873,Coping strategies are always good and sounds a worthwhile process. I’d like to suggest exercise to anyone young. I think it really can add to health both physical and mental. Adding exercise and it’s results would be something I’d like to see and how that affects younger folks with mental illness.
176024874,"well, I had heard voices and illusionary images that looked like a person but is actually a compound of different items. i believe these were due to the life experiences that i had, that i did not resolve at that point in time which led to the current state of mind. It embedded into my soul but other than this feeling all else is manageable"
176024875,_AT_MENTION_ thank you
176024876,I’d much rather it stay as gang crime. People with mental health problems are stigmatized and demonized way too much already.

Last night I realized this will either control me or I will be the hive leader and control it. Even tried to make people think they were aliens last night and some people posted it on here. I think im the most powerful schizophrenic. I know im crazy as ???? but it feels like im also making other people feel this way, it is like were repeaters for peoples thoughts and they all get louder when this gets worse, locating people and objects I do that too and have told it schizophrenic (telepathically) so its odd seeing it repeated here. Mental experiment I play is to figure out if this was real why would it be suppressed, well those that dont have super powers would get jealous so they make us think were crazy but its possible that i am, just odd my thoughts get repeated here or on reddit almost always the day after I have them."

It’s a blunt thing to say, but I had to accept my condition too. It’s not all circumstances. Schizophrenia is not the end of the world or a death sentence, although it certainly feels that way sometimes. Clearly, you are a smart man. Maybe it’s just anosognosia or something. I’m a conspiracy theorist but I’ve toned way back because it’s just boring and not my thing anymore. But I gravitate towards that group and way of thinking. You may not like it but I enjoy some of it. Millions do. You may not like the way I think, but that’s okay. See, I’m convinced I was experimented on, drugged, and more. Maybe something like mk-ultra at college. I’m mostly scared about talking about it like repercussions, and I doubt there’s any proof, but I’m sort of trying to move on because there’s nothing I can do. They diagnos
ed me with schizo-affective disorder – depressive type. I get flashbacks of getting ECT and riding the lightening and going inter-dimensional while under it and being told I have schizophrenia or them trying to lessen my schizophrenia (probably increase it). I can’t work or do anything. I’m okay with that. I feel like this isn’t my first life at all so I can’t do anything; prove anything; remember details. I really don’t care or believe _NAME_ is a man. But I had memories I was in the Illuminati in a past life or left. It was a long time ago and I don’t care or want to be a part of it anymore. Maybe the Illuminati/government did this to me.

I’m a lost cause, statistic, and have a bad fate. A fate worse than death in some instances. My brain is like scrambled eggs sometimes. I got memories of being hurt, time travel, aliens, mars, etc. It sp

176024999,"I take the Invega Sustenna 156mg monthly injection. I started with the max dose of 234mg and got it successfully lowered after about 9 months. It took some time but my delusional thinking eventually went away. After I came back down to reality I got hit with a very severe depression and started having nightmares. My psychiatrist put me on 100mg of Wellbutrin and I started feeling better immediately and got my motivation to do things back. That lasted for about a year during which I tried a lot of different medications for sleep but they only worked temporarily. As for the injection it cleared away my delusional thinking, I don’t hallucinate as much, voices pop up randomly, I’m firmly grounded in reality, I can formulate thoughts and speech clearly which I was having problems with, I still have racing thoughts and my memory is pretty good not as good as it used to be and my cognition and thoughts have gotten a lot better. I read books, listen to podcasts, take regular showers, maintain my hygien
e, work a little bit, talk to friends and socialize when I can. Even though I get hit with depression from time to time and sleep 12 hours a day I’m in a much better place where I was almost 3 years ago. I’m hoping the injection continues to work and I can maintain my stability for years to come and things continue to progress as they have. As for the side effects I have low libido, sexual dysfunction, low semen volume, high prolactin levels, slightly high cholesterol, and twitching in the face sometimes. Hopefully this helps and I hope you are lucky as I have been to find the right medication that works for me the second time around. Good luck with everything and hang in there!!!"

174348133,"So I’m going to be _NAME_ and say something in a way I don’t usually tend to say things. I am completely disgusted that someone with schizophrenia would use it as an excuse to act violently. The only time mental illness is a reason to act violently is when one is deemed legally insane, which in the United States means that you cannot tell right from wrong. You can clearly tell right from wrong. You knew what you were doing is wrong, and you even said you don’t care if you go to jail as long as the outcome was what you wanted. You would be lucky not to be in jail yet alone keep your job, and as someone else has stated I’m shocked that the police weren’t involved and it is a major failure with the system. Please own up to what you did and stop blaming your illness, as it degrades the work many of us do to try to limit _USER_ID_ associated with any mental illness. There is absolutely no reason that schizophrenia would make someone who is of sound mind, and knows right form wrong, walk toward

Her reasoning behind it was because I haven’t been taking the Abilify on a consistent basis as of late, she thinks I should work my way back up to 15mg by taking 10mg to get my system used to the meds again. I’m kinda leery about all this… It’s not like I completely quit taking the Abilify or anything-- I was just taking the 15mg on work days (which has proved not to be a very wise decision on my part).

They’re playing catch up with the virus. There’s an awful lot of covid misinformation out there. Stick to the main media outlets would be my advice. Avoiding conspiracy theories is probably good advice for a schizophrenic at the best of times anyway.
176025038,"I treat everyone with respect… however, for example, it’s looked down upon for a movie to cast a white person for a black part. That’s called white washing and oooh it’s so bad and evil. But when you take a white part and cast a black person in it, that’s considered progressive, inclusive, and good. I call bull-????. Blackwashing is just as offensive to me as whitewashing is to them. You can’t have a double standard like that. I don’t think that’s racist but I’ve mentioned it to others and I get the feeling some people might see it as racist."

When I was at my lowest deep down in psychosis I never would’ve thought I’d be in the headspace I’m in today. I’ve been psychosis free for 2 months now, when it was at its worst I came close to taking my own eyes out. Today I have a loving family back and a boyfriend who I love more than anything. I’m happy and healthy applying to continue my post secondary education. I’m putting this out there because I know what it feels like to not trust your own senses and people that you care about the most. Believe me that with the proper medication and support you can come on the other side and be the person you believe you once were before psychosis striked. Keep in mind that nostalgia is a lying b*tch and you might already be that person you are trying to go back to being. I love and appreacite you all, please have faith and stay strong. It won’t always be like t

176025091,"Growing up, my schools always had the custodians who came in after school was let out and most of the kids went home and swept and mopped the empty classrooms or came in on weekends to clean. Yeah, janitorial work ain’t bad, it’s the easiest work I can think of. Certainly the easiest job I’ve ever had and I can work at my own pace and work on my own 90% of the time. On a typical day, I rarely work with any other member of our crew. It’s not physically hard for sure except at age 59, I get a little tired near the end of the day from being on my feet all day. I think the biggest objection to the job most people would have is cleaning toilets. I think that is the number 1 objection. But to be _NAME_, cleaning toilets is a very small part of the job. To be honest, occasionally some slobs who were born in a barn won’t flush a toilet after they use it (even the women) so we have to flush it. But I figure it’s like being a doctor, you get used to seeing bodily fluids and you get numb to it and 
you get so it’s no big deal. But my company buys us good equipment and they got us a toilet brush on a 18 inch handle so the procedure for cleaning toilets is to squirt toilet bowl cleaner in the bowl, let it sit for ten minutes, stand there and scrub it with the brush which takes about ten seconds, then flush. No getting on your hands and knees and no bending. I only clean restrooms once a week and like I said, cleaning toilets is just one small task that needs to be done. Anyways, I do a lot of vacuuming and mopping, not the worst jobs in the world."

176025104,"Because I think it’s usually (not always) used as a socially acceptable way of bragging about being good. Because you’re not actually saying you’ve done great humanitarian acts, it doesn’t come off as bragging, even though the implication is pretty much the same (because we equate empathy with being a good person). You don’t often hear people who actually are exceptionally compassionate and kind brag about this or about being extraordinarily empathic. I think maybe because the motivation behind acts of compassion is rarely bragging rights. It’s intrinsically motivated. The only goal is compassion itself. And claiming to be compassionate is something that can be scrutinized, but a feeling such as empathy is not. So you can easily get away with bragging about it."
176025105,Now I can understand part of this mindset cause I feel like therapy is extremely beneficial especially in the long run. But medication has its place. I think the ratio of meds and therapy varies from patient to patient on whats most effective.

Plus, discuss it with real life people who know you well in advance. Doctor-people too, preferably. I just know ME: with less meds i feel more energetic, though nothing like before meds. I do spend a lot of that new energy on managing my more tumultuous inner life. My moods are less stable, which has good and bad sides. I never had mania, but life fu*king hurts sometimes with less meds. I simply have more feelings."

I’m scared if I tell him or even the pdoc that they will tell her - and that will be even more dangerous because then she will want to poison me even quicker.

176025300,Uhhh no but I came close when I was on geodon. It didn’t really work that well and I think the wellbutrin I was on at the time aggravated my symptoms.
176025301,I usually sleep well. For some reason last night I was nervous and didn’t sleep. I’m really upset with what’s going on with me. I don’t know what it is and trying to figure out where to go for help again.

So you are ahead of me when I was your age. I did OK later, and I’m doing some productive things now, but up until I was 30, I had up my ass until I got clean in 1990. I’m kinda on my own schedule, I’m 59 and still working on getting my college degree. Will I get some great job with a humanities degree? Highly unlikely, but when I finish my last three classes I’m going to feel really good and like I accomplished something. My job ain’t high status but it’s good enough for me.

174348198,"I am not completely sure when it started but I have been thinking things are gods sign. I have been thinking especially during falling asleep stages that I am being spoken to. It always comes down to religion and a Christianity vs me thing. This theme is recurring. For some reason this was common for sardar an inpatient in my first and second hospitalisations. The theme of being attacked by satellite or in wall technology or aerials is recurring. I will go tomorrow to buy abilify / aripiprazole as I’m out. Is this going to save me though? Because the voices were only audible in the sleep situations Otherwise I’ve had rare cases of them being audible in the faintest as feelings within and the idea of nanotechnology being used to infiltrate my body is back again. (Right idk if I’m being seen as serious here but, I’m in danger of psychosis - there’s no other way what is going on is not psychosis - I don’t know why I appear sound mind - I am definitely paranoid - I am trying to be logical a
nd balance my thinking with as many juxtaposed thoughts to the thoughts I have with whatever sense of self I have) I feel the Internet is the cause of a lot of my problems. Either god punishing me in an easy way through psychosis or I’m legit being attacked from somewhere with sophisticated means The next thing that that’ll happen is I’ll be super focused on who’s a sociopath and who’s not. Who’s god guided and who’s not. And a lot of other stupid things. Is thought reversal a thing? Is mind control (self induced) and thing? These things have to be real because there’s not many other ways for me to justify that it is neurologically possible to out do psychosis. (Allah, god, yhwh you’re either autistic or you’re a psychopath - give my mind back please)"

176025311,"so recently I’ve been looking for jobs. it’s probably best that I start off part time, but im feeling ambitious and well and I want to make some money. the only problem with full time work is I would have little time each day free. for example from where I live now, it would be an hour commute each way, so 2 hours on the road. and then 10 hours at work. most of the warehouse jobs hiring are 5 days a week 10 hour shifts, with overtime as needed. so in a given day, other than my 2 days off, I would only have 2 hours free. since I take about an hour, to shave, shower, get dressed, and use the bathroom. I only stay up 15 hours a day, and get plenty of sleep. 9 hours a night. I guess in a way it would be nice if I have the weekends off, and I could get excused absences for dr. appts. and my depot, to give me a day off during the week sporadically. if I had weekends free, I would probably have more of a social life and could get together with friends since they all work weekdays. I know it’s probab
ly smarter to go back to work part time but im feeling so ambitious, I want to pay off my place, and fix it up some, and I could do that faster if I worked full time. I might also consider getting into a trade, as it would pay better than warehouse work and I would probably have more vacation time."

I haven’t heard voices for 14 weeks but this is, I think, because the people doing it to me are giving me a break (but it also corresponds with a med increase) .So I believe by stopping my meds I will get my voices to return thereby proving that I have sz. What do you guys think?"

I also listen to a lot of music, or have it on in the background as I do things. I also like to clean and organize, which seems to make them happy. Painting, cooking too. What they don’t like is me sitting at the computer a lot; I can get really caught up in that."
176025329,"Just to correct you. My stepdaughter noticed I had swollen feet and legs. I’d also mentioned chest pains. My stepdaughter made me an appointment with the practice nurse. When heart failure was mentioned by the nurse not me. As a result of that when I experienced more chest pains my stepdaughter took me to the out of hours gp service at the small,local hospital. I was then told to go to a bigger hospital for more tests. That was based on the available info at the time. In no way was I being a hypochondriac over that. I wouldn’t have noticed the swollen feet and legs if my stepdaughter had said nothing. Luckily the tests were normal. It was better to be safe than sorry. Your response to this thread is exactly the kind of response that could stop a person having something checked out, with possibly serious consequences. In essence you are being irresponsible. I certainly don’t think I have every illness it’s possible to get. The dry eyes and mouth are very real. It could be due to mild dehydra

If she like to stick with me,I’ll be very happy,but if she’s unhappy and want to leave I’ll let her go because I hate holding on someone while she’s not perfectly ok with me.Part of reason she’s married me is because my family can provide her with a good life,no need to worry for clothes,food or shelter.If all she bet on is this part,I don’t think our relationship will last long,or if it did last,she wou

176025338,"I don’t know what it is like in your country. In my country, I was never violent, but I had a psychotic episode for 2 months 13 years ago, and I ended up going driving in a confused, psychotic state. I didn’t stop for police soon enough for their taste because I thought I was in a different universe, and didn’t think they were real police. When I stood before a judge, I told him I was going to keep taking my medication (at the prompting of my lawyer). I got 2 years probation instead of 1 year in jail. After about 2 years on medication, my psychiatrist gave me the option if trying to wean off medication. So, there is a story of how these things go sometimes. In some countries, if you can show yourself stable for a year or two, you can get some options opened up. I hope that helps."

I mean there are some apps to protect kids, but most of it is easy to bypass if they know a little about computers. If I was in charge I would have all the adult stuff on a different platform. I’m not saying I would make it illegal, I would just make it easier for people to choose not to have it. They expect us to have will power like a zen master 24/7. Some asian countries regulate that stuff. Thailand and China are protecting their populations, maybe others too. I think that is the right way to go."

174348223,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Ketogenic diet for schizophrenia: clinical implication. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Current opinion in psychiatry , Jun 2019 11 The aim of this article is to review recent findings on the efficacy of ketogenic diet in preclinical models and in patients with schizophrenia. This review will also highlight emerging evidence for compromised glucose and energy metabolism in schizophrenia, which provides a strong rationale and a potential mechanism of action for ketogenic diet.Recent transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic evidence from postmortem prefrontal cortical samples and in-vivo NMR spectroscopy results support the hypothesis that there is a bioenergetics dysfunction characterized by abnormal glucose handling and mitochondrial dysfunctions resulting in impaired synaptic communication in the brain of people with schizophrenia. Ketogenic diet, which provides alternative fuel to glucose for bioenergetic processes in the brain, normalizes schizophrenia-like behaviours in transla
tionally relevant pharmacological and genetic mouse models. Furthermore, recent case studies demonstrate that ketogenic diet produces improvement in psychiatric symptoms as well as metabolic dysfunctions and body composition in patients with schizophrenia.These results support that ketogenic diet may present a novel therapeutic approach through restoring brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further show the efficacy of ketogenic diet as a co-treatment to manage both clinical symptoms and metabolic abnormalities inherent to the disease and resulted by antipsychotic treatment."

Most of the time I’m experiencing mood symptoms like either very low and thinking thoughts like no one cares about me im worthless I’m a fraud and thinking something is myfault, like _NAME_s death , But then an hour or so later I’m high and thinking I am God and psychic. Sometimes it’s a mix. Earlier I posted I felt like I was God but I wanted to die. Now I just feel anxious and j cant sleep but jn extremely tired. Every time j close my eyes I think of something I need tk do right now on my phone or something. I never have insomnia issues so idk what to do with myself. Is this a mixed episode ? I’m currently diagnosed sza depressed type but I think I’m bipolar"
176025381,Im not sure. One of them was a life skills group with heavy group participation and going off topic and sort out personal problems. Ive never done cbt so im not sure what it should look like.
176025382,That sounds like a little serious side-effect. I would get that checked out with your doc.
176025383,I cant drink more than a big cup of coffee in the morning. More and I get agitated. I just had a big cup of black tea its 6pm and I feel agitated. I wish I didnt drink it…
176025384,"I guess they are more the anti-ppsychiatric types, bless them."
176025385,Are you seeing a pyschiatrist? You should find a good medication and a pyschiatrist. What you experience is very similar to what I’ve had. The physical hallucinations have been described to me as tactile hallucinations. You also appear to have auditory hallucinations but I really am not someone to diagnose you. You should talk to your mental health providers and seek treatment. When I had them it was absolute torment for me my experience was very similar and I suffered for years. You really need to see someone and get on the proper medications. It’s helped me tremendously.
176025386,"I have been having this unusual perspective or feeling lately that I will try to describe. It feels like I am just partially in the cockpit of my life sometimes, like I am only halfway attentive and otherwise hazed out. I can’t tell if this is a focus issue that I am experiencing for the first time or if it’s some different mind state. It isn’t really that much like a dissociation but it is like somewhat of a disconnect. It sort of seems like it’s an issue with being in the ‘here and now’ which suggests to me that it is some kind of issue processing my reality. It is so hard to describe though and when it happens it’s pretty hard to put it into words. Does anyone have any idea what I am talking about? Do any of you get weird mind states where you don’t feel normal? Please try to describe what they are like if you can."

176025401,You definitely have a point there _AT_MENTION_ . My gf said the exact same thing.
176025402,I’m not quite sure. I think you would have to eat fish 4 times a week to get the recommended amount. Omega 3 is supposed to be beneficial for schizoprenia so you might consider supplementing with it anyways. I do.

176025412,You obviously have high blood sugar. Based on taking the glucose control pills. Abruptly stopping them can cause high blood sugar and the shock that can come with that. You could end up in a diabetic coma. Please take your meds. At the very least the risperdone and glucotrol.
174348236,"did you have a delusion or something? what would cause the psych to give you an abilify shot. that seems pretty serious to warrant that. So maybe something was going on that you were not aware of. When you first get an episode, usually your not aware that you are even having an episode. This is because we lack insight that anything is even wrong. So you may need to dig a bit on that. For me after each episode i had more negative symptoms. Lack motivation, avolition, flat affect. Try drinking coffee, maybe it will help perk you up. If your planning to go to college, then do a bit of prep by learning a bit each day. That might kick your brain into a better gear, as doing nothing will make it worse. kind of the use it or lose it sorta thing."
176025413,"i read that almost half of schizophrenics have an anxiety problem. i dont know if they have a full fledeged disorder comorbid, or if it’s just part of the sz. also. how many of you have an anxiety that feels physical? more than just worry or fear. what do you even call anxiety that feels physical? when i google search anxiety, it’s often described as a mental thing, like worry and such. but for me, it feels like a physical problem. i feel like i cant sit still or i want to explode. i tend to just call it anxiety but like i said google says that’s for things like worry and such. my therapist said anxiety feeling physical is often due to the _USER_ID_ in the brain."

176025459,No. You did the right thing by telling. Giving people the wrong meds is dangerous. It could even be lethal. There’s a reason we need prescriptions from a dr. Don’t feel bad. She should apologize to you for screwing up your meds.
176025460,It really manifested at 22. Don’t get me wrong I was in la la land before. But I was very reserved and not grandiose. When I was 20 I first had a delusion my life was an experiment and my doctor and therapist my real parents and people in my life paid actors. I got arrested for the way I was acting in the moment. Then I went to the psych ward the delusions got way worse. And changed to aliens and god had chosen me for a purpose. Then I stopped believing them for a while on meds. But I was off meds in iop and people seemed to be feeding into my delusions or that’s what I thought. And I really believed them again on my 22nd birthday. Then it was exactly 8 years later. On my 30th birthday I stopped believing them after being completely convinced for a while. And with that came other delusions. But I’m pretty sure i still have persisting delusions. But it’s like I don’t believe them anymore. It’s just a habit in my mind to think that way. But they’re still there. But I can live my life now

It was embarrassing ultimately but my point is I always pick up the pen, not the sword. Always. A tidbit from Wikipedia is that those with sz are more likely to have violence done to them than the other way around.

176025550,Insomnia can occur due to several reasons. If you take a stimulant medication it can cause insomnia. Coffee is a stimulant so is tea as both contain caffeine. Several medications come under stimulant category. For example adderall used for ADHD is stimulant. So the first step is to eliminate all stimulants from your diet. The next reason for insomnia is day time sleep. Avoid using bed unless its night sleep time. Try these two tips and see if its helping your night time sleep.

Its been going on for years now, probably a few months after the dx i just cant have more than one hobby/career interest. And when i have that one thing i obsess over it and quickly burn myself out. I personally think its because i want some structure, or to have something that i can always go to. Besides that its also because i want to be really good at something, but only that one thing so that i can be something of an expert on the subject. Of course since nothing ever sticks i end up knowing a tiny bit about a lot of stuff, which is the opposite of what i want in life. Anyone else have this? Did you overcome it? How? Thanks."

176025608,"It was a very good med. I suppose I may as well share my new med plan. My doctor believes my psychosis was primarily caused by the severe insomnia I have as a side effect from my brain tumor. So he is treating me for a sleep disorder rather than direct psychosis. I have to follow a very strict sleep regimen that includes going to bed at an exact time, waking up at an exact time, never napping, wearing my C-pap machine every night, no screens after a certain time, an hour of exercise every day, no caffeine, etc. I also am taking about 5 different sleeping pills on rotation as well as a super low dose of a mild stimulant to keep my brain fully awake during the daytime. I am being monitored very closely because there is a real risk that my psychosis will return. I am nervous about trying something so different, but it has been going well so far. The doctor I am seeing is considered to be the top expert in my area for unique brain disorders. Following my sleep regimen is super hard, because some days I 
just want to take a nap. But I can’t deny it feels so much better to be sleeping 6-9 hours a night consistently instead of my previous usual of 4. I want to stress that this plan is not a plan for others to follow. It is specific to me because I had a brain tumor in the sleep center of my brain, and removing it caused severe damage to that area."

176025625,"_AT_MENTION_ how are you dear friend? I’ve been better. I REALLY need a friend who understands right now and I thought of you. Just so you know, my book JWS&SAI is F R E E right now if you get there within the next day or so and order it so that you can have an actual digital copy that might be a little easier to read if you haven’t already finished it. So back in April as it happens around every Easter I was suffering from the loudest of rude voices for the first time in the two years since I started taking my Vraylar as prescribed (and then some on bad days as encouraged by pdoc). The voices kept telling me to stop taking my Vraylar and I remember on multiple occasions getting vocal with them about it. They laughed and reminded me of all the fun times I had listening to them from 2014 until (again April… this time 4/20) 2016. I sure did enjoy hearing from them but after the 2016 blackout that got me banished from my family home and found me sleeping on the streets I wasn’t about to jeopar
dize all the healing my mind has done in the last four years. I am as mentally stable as I think that I will ever be at this moment right now but the peak of my mental stability is just a hair above non-existent. I’m not kidding. I seriously hear voices that claim divine & celestial origins and they beg of me “just listen. Just write.” I really don’t mind writing in defense of the existence of Gods but it’s the other guys that get me all snared up in the most ridiculously awkward and simple of snares set by fools following an even bigger fool. 2Corinthians 11:14 And no wonder for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. He’s not even the worst of the worst that I have endured. Good ol’ _PERSON_. He sees it coming seeing as I suffered extreme brain damage in a dangerous fall I took as a two year old toddler. The fall broke my neck so I’m all kinds of positivity and cheerfulness, don’t you know it? I’m really just trying to be funny because I enjoy making people smile. When the voices 
started in 2010 I never told anyone because they were unfathomably benevolent in all of their words and all of their sensations that they caused with the simple power of their graceful words. They were beauty. They were loving kindness. They explained if I wished them gone I must say quite simply a formal & genuine prayer to the Gods to be gone for a time always with the understanding that they were welcome back at a more convenient hour. That was 2010 to 2014. Quite possibly as early as 2013 “_NAME_” as I was writing had popped energetically into my world and I instantly fell in love with the most fun & entertaining voice that I have to this date (08/29/2020) yet heard. I F R I G G I N K N O W I don’t need to see yet A N O T H E R “It’s a delusion. Here let me give you the formal definition of delusion because you seem sadly misinformed about what is happening to you.” To hell and back with that you rude a s s prejudiced people. Just because I call it a S P I R I T U A L A T T A C K and you call 
it delusion does not make you right and it is very sad that there are so many ignorant tattle tales that are going to attempt to void my words with theirs. The demons tried that on me too. Maybe YOU’RE demons… I know better. I’m far from stupid but your continued LACK OF RESPECT is kind of disgusting. Seriously? How hard is it to f×××ing STOP READING? Like what is honestly wrong with you people that you jump to hide trigger posts. For the love of the Gods people just stop reading! Like it really isn’t hard. Not all of YOUR posts are relevant to me so what do I do? I don’t f×××ing read it because it doesn’t pertain to me."
176025626,I feel so numb and dead. I don’t know why I’m getting symptoms again. Since June my depression finally lifted after months. And my voices were very infrequent. Now since end of September the depression feelings returned and lately been hearing _PERSON_ and _NAME_ a lot. They would argue about me. And _PERSON_ still threatens me and laughs in my head. Like yesterday. Today been on and off low. Everything is so pointless. I actually managed to paint but it didn’t take my low feelings away for long. Now at night I feel like going into my dark studio downstairs and taking the knife I keep there to defend myself in case and cutting just to feel real. God I’m terrified that I’m a fake. I feel like I’m really a hypocrite like _PERSON_ says. Am I really real? Or not? I don’t know. If it weren’t for my husband I would come off my meds. Just I’m terrified that if I do and I’m ok then I’ve been a liar all along. Maybe I’m scared if I would be well that it would mean I’m not me anymore
. WTF?
176025627,Yes the above suggestion is best. Take the minimum amount of AP to give you enough insight or control of your illness and then manage the rest by use of therapy and other coping mechanisms. This way side effects of APs can be minimized to maximum extend. Also damage from psychosis is mostly likely when the individual fail to function or indulge in psychotic thoughts and feelings rather than take part in daily activities and other goals in life.
176025628,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ ! Yes I think he will _AT_MENTION_ . My mom told me we would have alternating weekends on with my sister but that I would be here during the day and week. I think they’d take the pressure off me. But I just worry about my ability to farm with sz. It’s super defying the odds to be farming with a major mental illness but part of me is just being realistic. I got voices bad a number of times this year from unexpected work I had to do and I had plans to expand the herd and that work would only increase making symptoms worse. It also puts me in a bad mood sometimes and the last thing I want to do at the end of the day is care for somebody else being honest, the work is just too hard on me. I don’t know what to do, part of me thinks family first but then the sz might fuuck me over anyway. I would make a good bit of money being a Carer as well. Possibly the same as farming."

176025630,"I’ve never thought of “speaking out” as a dangerous thing until I developed sz. I’ve always wanted to advocate for people with disabilities. I wanted to speak out about having a physical disability/mental health issues. I wanted to help others who are going through the same thing. But it isn’t so easy. The moment I risk speaking out about having two disabilities, I risk to inflict danger to my family’s reputation. I don’t know what will happen to my father’s job because I’m pretty sure they know how I look like, and my brother can become an outcast if his classmates know that I am disabled. My mother suffered enough because of my disability. My brother didn’t tell others that I was paralyzed for a year because he was ashamed. He blamed me for “not trying enough” to “fix” my disability. He doesn’t know that I have sz, and if I tell him, I’m banished from the family for life. Maybe things will be different if I do, but for now, I can’t talk about it. I don’t know i
f I’m supposed to work out like 24/7 or never talk about pain in front of my brother ever again. Last time I did, my brother snapped and yelled at me. I can’t moan, speak about pain, express my emotions, or talk about my disability. To be honest, I’m scared of my brother. I’m scared that someone is going to snap in my family. I’m afraid of going to the hospital because I feel like my mother’s going to hate me. My family is kind of like a love-hate relationship for me. I just feel like I’m an embarrassment of this family? As if no one wants me? I know that I’m full of worth. I had a good education, and I speak two languages. And I know my parents love me, in a way, to provide a good education and support me financially. I work full-time, and I have the power to manage a lot of my finances on my own without my parents’ control. I have a dream of becoming a speech language pathologist. I know that I have a lot of dreams and hopes, but it feels like I’m just nothing (or as it seems, according 
to my family) and I’m not worth anything. Sometimes, I just feel like killing myself is the only answer to free my family from pain. In the meantime, I’m going to watch recipe videos from food wishes. Here’s one of my favourite recipes."
176025631,You’re Funny _AT_MENTION_… . …
176025632,"I feel like this with my husband’s family - like I don’t belong and that they think I’m crazy one. I feel a little paranoid around them - especially his mother. She tries to control my mind. With my own family I feel safe and loved. Especially with my sister who’s had mental health problems as well, although not psychosis, she understands anxiety and depression very well."
176025633,Yeah. I worry about brain washing etc. it scares me _AT_MENTION_
176025634,_USER_ID_ if you dont like something just change it. It wont be easy to do but you can do it if it bothers you enough
174348285,Did you try raising your med dosage?
176025635,"Just curious to know, figured I’d ask, I chose the unmedicated route, which has been okay so far, but I worry about the ocd part of the illness being unmedicated? Any help?"
176025636,Yeah the voices make breath into words to and the cars passing by and all the noises in the house
176025637,It could be. I hadn’t thought of that.
176025638,"Start by looking at the world scientifically. Everything that results in answers such as the unprovable and imaginative spirit world should be automatically dismissed as nonsense, which it is. Your beliefs need to be questioned as to how you arrived at such imaginations and beliefs. Once you deprogram yourself then you can understand that it is your previous beliefs that have tainted your hallucinations. Hallucinations caused by the scientific diagnosis of sz."
176025639,"I actually think this kind of proves my point… I’ve had very long and severe depressions. They suck a lot, yes, but there are millions of things that suck more, including Ebola."
176025640,"Worst: “Hey, do you want to kill me? Do you like Insane Clown Posse?” starts playing a song by them on their phone and puts it up against my ear Best: “omg, you’ve been psychotic? I never would have guessed - you seem so put together!” And then the subject was dropped and we went on with our lives in blissful harmony."
176025641,I just keep thinking is this over yet lol
176025642,"i pray, im going to wear mask just in case at home just in case."
176025643,i doubt you can fake psychosis for 3 weeks just because of alcohol…
176025644,Have you tried Zyprexa? _AT_MENTION_
174348287,"I am not as social as before psychosis and have much less friends but I am still a bit social. I just talk video chat with my 2 remaining friends now since having severe negative symptoms. They keep insisting about picking me up from my house but I tell them I have no energy, maybe when a better med comes out or if Vraylar works. We play online video games together."
176025645,I was supposed to take it twice a day so that makes sense
176025646,"I get that when I am coming off an anti-psychotic. It feels good. It is a dangerous temptation for me, because the manic phase always escalates until I get in trouble."
176025647,"I can relate to your experiences _AT_MENTION_ . I completed college for computer science and received my diploma. I wanted to progress further so I applied for the software developer degree at a university. Bad move for me. I was overwhelmed with the amount of work and pretty much failed most of my courses. I fell into depression and turned to drugs for the second time. I kept telling myself to go further and further to advance my education, but I burned out. My advice to you is to take it easy. If you want to go back to school then do it, but just take part time only. Hope this helps."
176025648,"No people think I’m hard looking I think, no one would know I’m sZ. My hair is a bit crazy nowadays with the barbers being closed so I do prob look crazy as f fck nowadays, my eyes are googley as well which is even worse, I also look like that _NAME_ cuddihy buck who killed his parents which also an omen"
176025649,Virtually no one here has that. That’s like asking a cloud what it’s like to be a basketball. After it’s been doped up on ‘basketball’ drugs to ‘heal’ it.
176025650,_AT_MENTION_ I know it’s hard to leave someone you feel comfortable with. But he may not be helpful for you. You are strong enough to do life without him if you decide!
174348296,"okay, im going to tell my pdoc to put me on abilify, hopfully i wont have anymore heart problems. I dont think its my preworkout before i was taking preworkouts my heart was fine, after i increase my geodon then it all started."
176025651,I recently started Abilify on top on my Clozapine and I’ve been very irritable and I’ve had an extremely short fuse. Could this be the Abilify or is it more likely to be the start of a manic episode? My sleep has been lacking and I’ve also had a lot more energy and motivation as well as a lot of anxiety.
176025652,You are your own frame of reference right now. It is making you believe really ridiculous stuff. You won’t change without meds.
176025653,Another great one! That is a super impressive amount of detail for such a small drawing
176025654,I’m glad you have a stepmother now that you like.
176025655,When I’m by myself I always have company!!
176025656,I am left handed and creative. I use to be also good a math.
176025657,I would probably call the police
176025658,"Honestly _AT_MENTION_ I don’t want to dis your beliefs but if something is making you ill - stop doing it. Maybe this is uncalled for and too political but part of what made me an atheist is the idea of heaven V hell. To me its a way of controlling people. Make sure you know the voices are just a hallucination. They’re not a messenger from god. Try filling that space with something related to reading. Maybe you ought to try to find some books that aren’t directly related to holy books. Fantasy novels, books talking about certain subjects from history, or even philosophy. I found philosophy really holds my attention when I am feeling slightly psychotic. Psychology is also very interesting if you move away from academic books on the subject. Mindfulness mediation is highly recommended if you want something to soothe your nerves."
176025659,"Just time, tried Prozac once, and had a bad experience myself, but it had changed over time"
176025660,"Not true, _NAME_, You’re not a waste of space. That’s just the illness talking. You’re a valued member here and I want to see you get better."
176025661,This is so tempting to do. But problems generally don’t get solved unless they are addressed. Are you having symptoms?
176025662,Maybe that’s why there is not enough information in my mental health records they probably covered their tracks.
176025663,That was during psychosis
176025664,I am glad you are stable … Will you see them on a regular basis ? Usually I see a pdoc when needed and the next time i see one when needed but its never the same pdoc…
176025665,_AT_MENTION_ We all change as we grow up. It’s great you two could connect. So meaningful!
176025666,"it’s like a fire. some times big and long and some times small and worm. but sz is always there, will never live will never end. well. voices counts? then many, many years. long, “hellusinative” delusions? 4"
176025667,"I’m glad he is doing all that, but honestly no 18 year old can handle all that for too long. People said how amazing I was at 18 when I took on serious adult responsibilities, but I was half a second away from breaking down at any given time. Please get that boy some therapy and some help."
176025668,"Also, not interacting. It’s good to be able to walk away from a confrontation as well."
176025669,Go art classes but don t quit your job
174348295,"Yeah, I have to go completely off of it when my positive symptoms are bothersome because it makes me paranoid, anxious, and hallucinate more. But for some reason it doesn’t really affect my OCD like it does for my older brother."
176025670,"I do a packet a day. So it’s probably a couple every time I’m out for it. unless I’m particularly enjoying myself/stressed, I’ll generally stick to a packet a day."
176025671,"I’m so mad right now, the nurse or whoever assists the doctor asked me about my shoulder and says the doctor probably can’t see me about losing weight. I don’t know what my mom said when she scheduled this but I took off work for this and everything and ugh I am so pissed."
176025672,I struggle too. Brain fog.
176025673,_AT_MENTION_ do you have your old Theory of Law (Philosophy) books with you?
176025674,Im pretty straight forward. I dont tell every little detail but cover most things. Shes very empathetic and all for helping the patient

176025676,"It’s ok, none of us are that important to be watched! But, there’s no way even if you were important to be watched (such as big time drug dealer or something similar) nothing can read anyone’s thoughts. I always wished there was a device to record my dreams because I forget them and some of them are really cool, but sadly this technology doesn’t exist!"
176025677,Cogentin? What is it for?
176025678,"Aerobic exercise improves mood and focus. Take it easy if you are out of shape, otherwise you will get exhausted and abandon it before you can reap the benefits."
174348300,"Recovery was not too great to me either. I dont actually get negative symptoms though anymore, and my wellbeing seems to get back on track mostly. It is not without its caveats though."
176025679,"Oh right, not atm, gotta be in the mood to draw, which is not really every day. Now that I’ve given up coffee for new years, I dunno if I can still draw. Hopefully, lol"
176025680,Well I do it when it hurts to much mentally or to punish myself for something I did.
176025682,It took me 6 to start relapsing. Was not fun at all. 0/10 would NOT recommend.
176025683,I also stopped talking with friends using weed. I deleted and blocked them.
176025684,I’ve heard what’s it like and it would be better for me than meds… I hate taking meds personally
176025685,"It gave me nothing but the shakes and hypothyroidism, it’s supposed to be good for manic episodes, i took it for resistant depression and it just blew my metabolism. The only drug that has helped my depression, is isocarboxide, an mao-inhibitor."
176025686,My longest lasting bands that have stuck with me over the years — Modest Mouse NOFX Sole How ever I don’t have much time for music anymore
176025687,Yes. I also try to be open minded about mental health and i’m reserved about it because is none of anybody business
176025688,Olanzapine made me into zombie and fat. I hate that drug
176025689,"Well ,I have thought about telling him that I am going to sign up for my psychology courses to meet other boys and thus to see if he reacts and wants to keep me by his side but I’m afraid he will only want a sexual relationship with me like when I had my boyfriend"
176025690,"Jesus _NAME_, you were drinking 12 pints a day??"
176025691,"I love my mother, in spite of what some of you may think. We’ve always had a special relationship ever since I was a child I always felt so safe and comforted with my mother. She could put me at ease with just a one or two words. But I want to be able to do the same for her, I don’t want her to feel any doubt over her mortality I want her to be happy. I think My mom is worried about dying. I know she is. There was a programme on tv about a local guy who’s an undertaker, she suggested it but She said she didn’t wana watch anything to do with funerals. I wanted to comfort her but I’m worried I won’t say the right thing so I said nothing I just asked her if she was ok. I wanted so bad to reassure her, but I was worried something would come out wrong and it would make her feel worse.shes no dying so Tell me, what can I say to her to comfort and reassure her?"
176025692,Ok thanks for your help _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_
176025693,Lions mane got rid of my anxiety. But you cannot claim it will work for everyone because everyone is different.
176025694,"yep, i said we could rearrange it and that i’d invite her over for netflix but i didnt want to put her at risk"
174348299,"I’m sorry I’m writing this after so long but I really wish you’d respond to this post. I was just wondering how much time it took for you to finally get well (I suppose you’re doing alright now). I’m struggling with pretty much the same problem as described in the topic. Almost 4 months have passed since I was given a 400mg shot and to this day I feel terrible; I feel like I became really dumb, can’t understand people talking to me and I can’t even talk without stuttering, feels like aphasia. I’m really looking forward to get at least a little bit better because so much time has passed and I still fell awfully. Well, at least akathisia is almost gone, but every other side effect is still with me. I was given the shot 2nd march this year and it seems that 69 mg out of 400 are still remaining."
176025695,I just have one monthly cost me 7 dollars
176025696,I was paranoid before age 13 but it only started as a result of bullying. And someone trying to cut my hair. When I was about 5 or 6. People used to think I was weird because I used to talk to myself and have odd scenarios for my imaginary friends. I remember when I was younger the children in my class used to run away from me and that was why i made up my own imaginary friends with weird names and all. that I used to have.i had discovered myself quite early in my life and as a result was inappropriate at school i used to smell as well due to someone in my family smoking heavily in the house and the washing not being taking out in time. And I was also friends with a special needs girl because I felt sorry her because they were picking on her. But I learned to become a loner from a very young age.I was a very odd child. I did make friends with some others like me but that slowly dwindled due to me wanting to play the same games all the time.for example cats and dogs and things based off the TV it and 
games like that
174348301,Yeah are you on Abilify? This can cause hyper sexuality
176025697,Yah you seem to be doing really well lately. _PERSON_. I think it is going to be awhile before I can work.
174348302,"No sex drive, can barely get it up, yay ap meds! When I was psychotic I had a few encounters and had like superhuman sex drive."
176025698,"Ok, today some stronger, saner and positive emotions hit me for a few, without even that I expect it… And it was great, pals I realized suddenly, that all these past years, I was emotionally disabled. In what way though? In the way that I mostly was feeling hurted emotions, they were weak, unable to come more on the surface of my being, negative too I guess… You know that I fight. But will I be able to recover for longer times on my emotions? Who did it here? I wonder also if the zyprexa kills the feelings, but I need it, so… I even realized that I turned neurotic and womanizing, cause my emotions were precisely this mess all hurted, weak and negative yeah… This thing with the emotions is a negative symptom, pals? I guess I’ll help them more if I continue my activities and efforts… music, books, movies, moving around, being positive, be virtuous, letting go etc… It sucks, but I am again in pain now and I’ll be it still in the future, cause the shock from my sz was big… I wish that 
the things start to improve already bit by bit Is it hard to fix the emotions? Take care all"

176025701,"I was wondering if I could hide my Gmail account from my profile, how do I do?"
176025702,"I’ve lost my mind and going insane. I don’t know if it’s sz or just plain crazy here. It does all calm down sometimes or I focus on something productive, but then it just goes crazy. So much random nonsense going on. Like, a robot malfuctioning. I know I’m schizotypal personality disorder or maybe schizoid."

176025706,"I used to get bad cases of poison oak when I was growing up. When I say bad I mean all over 2/3 of my body including my face and my nether regions. Oh man, it felt so good to scratch it but that makes it worse and makes it spread. I remember getting poison oak all around my mouth so I couldn’t eat; I had to sip soup through a straw. I don’t want to give TMI but nothing feels better than scratching poison oak on your crotch. It was ecstasy but you pay the price later."

176025713,I didn’t think I was bullying. Take care and have a good day yourself.

176025715,Anyone else get fed up with the voices and start mouthing off to them? So sick of their stupid commentary every freaking day. Gotten to the point where I’m cussing them out and telling them off and what hypocrites and insightless things they are including the ones who are claiming they’re Jesus. Really fed up.

I did that, my portions are the size of the frot of my fist, and I’ ve lost 41 pounds! That’s since October and o ne max Invega of 234. That’s withput exercise. Can only imagine what moderate exercise will bring!"
176025722,"I was out on my parents boat and we were sitting anchored near an island and I was reading a book and it talked about nature…and it talked about Jesus. And it was beautiful in a way. But Without getting religious, But I thought about how I don’t wanna be Jesus…or ANYTHING. Like that. At all. . And I was in this beautiful scenery. And for 10 minutes I thought there is no pressure to do anything in the world. Whenever I go back to too much ambition and destiny I think I will revisit this happy place. It will be a sort of mantra for me to think about this. I hate being tortured by delusions but for a second everything was perfect and if I can recapture that when I need to maybe it’ll decimate with time. What a great day it’s been. Have u ever found something similar. A happy place where delusions go away??"
176025723,scrambled eggs!
176025724,Welcome to the forum!!! I agree with _AT_MENTION_. It sounds to me like you need a different psychiatrist.
176025725,Gotta appeal to authority here. You can’t be the only sane person in the world. Also you were a lot more together pre-SZ. You can remember that.

174348306,"I find this as well. My suspicion is that we’re some of the lucky ones who respond well enough to medication and have not suffered too much brain damage during psychosis. After having a few people do this to me, I have been asking to be re-diagnosed and it irritates everyone in my care team who keeps telling me I have Schizophrenia, and no amount of asking will ever change that. I used to quit my meds cold turkey a lot, but I have stopped doing that over the last two years. So not been to hospital in that long. Now the psychosis has been kept under control, we’re now dealing with underlying anxiety, Akasthia and now Autism. It has been a _USER_ID_. I have no idea how I managed to get through all this ????. I guess it’s a journey we’re in together, and everyone is always at different stages at different times throughout a Sz life"

176025748,Honestly im feeling better had a cry talked to mum im going to call my case co ordinator monday and make sure he knows how bad its gotten and i will do the same thursday with the pdoc. Im gonna start with small steps doing things again. I like your idea of having a list of things to fall back on. _PERSON_ wants more plants and asked me to help as to give me something to do from tomorrow.

In fact, the most effective treatment I’ve tried was the combination of the stimulant methylphenidate with the opioid buprenorphine.

176025773,That’s awesome news _AT_MENTION_ ! It happens to me too. My sza tends to be cyclical - relapse then remission then relapse and so on. I’m in a good stable place at moment. In the last year I was in hospital three times (every four months) and now been out of hospital for six months. My chronic depression has lifted since I’ve been taking Lamotrigine 150mg along with my AP’S
176025774,I was switched from olanzapine to latuda. Olanzapine did help me I believe. It was sedating and I almost drewled and felt very stagnated and slow but it did help me I believe. I put on 24 kg on it so my other psychiatrist put me on latuda instead. They startedme on 40 mg but then another psychiatrist put me on 120 mg latuda and I was really doing well so I’m down to 80 mg now. When I was first put on 120 mg I got severe jaw clenching and it really hurt and was tense and I could t relax. It was so awful I was ready to swap medication but my psychiatrist told me to hold out a little longer while my body got used to the dose and the side effects just went away by them self thankfully. Benzotrap did not take away side effects nor did Antanax. I think both olanzapine and latuda helped me but I had less weight gain on latuda. I am really well and stable on latuda now.
176025775,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , you could try smaller ones and/or doing partials or ‘special drill’ ones. The pencil case one I did only took an hour or two and I was taking my time. I’m glad you liked the elephant one, I actually gave it to one of my mums friends recently. It only took a few days for me to do and is a ‘partial’. For me, time flies when I get into painting mode _AT_MENTION_ , I have sealed 2 of the projects I have done so far. I used a clear acrylic spray on the pencil case and a diary/book that I have done. I do have some ‘mod podge’ that I will use to seal some other paintings I have done, but, haven’t got around to doing it yet. I have read that if you put the paintings under glass that you shouldn’t need to seal."

Her results, presented on Sunday at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in New _USER_ID_ , showed that cognitive stimulation from parents at the age of four was the key factor in predicting the development of several parts of the cortex – the layer of grey matter on the outside of the brain – 15 years later. If I had kids I would force them to do so much learning at an early age that they would probably end up hating me. That’s probably why I will never be a father."

176025786,If I believe my mother in law will eventually poison me is it anxiety or paranoia? What about if I feel others would in general? And what about if I have a fear of being kidnapped when I’m walking somewhere? Or being shot through the window at night when I hear someone outside? What’s the difference between anxiety and paranoia? Once I had a bad episode when I was at mosque last year when I believed the men that came and sat behind curtain in women’s section were gunmen in league with the imam. I knew that was paranoia but if I feel a general fear of being harmed is it?
176025787,"I can relate. My mother was highly abusive to me when I was a child. One of the voices I started hearing was hers but it wasn’t the dark women who beat me or starved me. No, the voice was kind, explaining why I had to go through what I did. It told me how sorry it was to have inflicted such pain. Personally, I like to call that the “Dream” version of my mother. Some part of her subconscious that actually cares and feels guilt. A part that she accesses while she’s sleeping. That voice guided me a lot when I was homeless. It helped me not feel such pain. What’s so wrong with that? It’s how I finally came to terms with my abuse and how I can now talk to my mother (limited time frame). I personally believe that if a voice is a positive in an individuals life, that is to say it doesn’t negatively effect the one who hears it or those around them it shouldn’t be avoided. To me it is a healthy voice, a way that my brain developed to overcome the trauma."

I know we all have cancer cells but I’ve had several biopsies of moles that turned out cancerous and I was trying to explain to them that I have to be careful when I go out and that I DO go out but that I have an extreme phobia of being too exposed to the sun. I have a horrific relationship with the sun. I have a belief that the sun is going to kill me. I don’t know why I think this way, but they both kept grilling me about it.

But dogs bond very quickly with humans, so it’s not recommended to let people take them on a trial basis.

176025896,"I hated it when it happened in terms of my over all spacial awareness. I wasn’t able to remark typical brooding or indolence, then reeling in helplessness. I told so many tales to others, some of them tall tales, however now the voices crowded out the strangers in the crowd. I wasn’t able to hide in the details of a morning newspaper, or late night talk show, or go to work, then. I feared like as much as death, like a new form of fear I had not known, like I was terrorized, when enough was enough. I trembled in anxiety, stress, and trauma, my heart in my chest feeling different, my brain now like black tar, like something used to pave a street, which reversed this fatality about life’s mediocrity, transforming it to a life of misery."

174348363,"When people take LSD and freak out over it in an intense manner, usually they know deep down they have control, somewhat. They play music they like (instrumentals are better), they look at pictures of cats, they go to a comforting room. With schizophrenia it’s really no different so long as you have insight. Obviously since you are posting on this forum and saying what you are saying, you have insight that these are not real. Take control as much as you can, do what you can to comfort yourself. If you have anyone trusted to call, call them. If things deteriorate, you know the hospital or a help line is there. I really hope the voices stop soon, and that you feel better. My sympathies."

And like, it’d be one thing if people thought I was annoying or whatever and just didn’t want to be my friend, right? But no, people want to treat me like absolute garbage, and then ask me for favors and sh it; they only want to be around me when they want something. I was in band for three years, and I got invited somewhere literally once, and I managed to convince one single person to hang out with me one single time. Oh, but then people had no issue asking me for my food or drink, asking for tutoring, asking me to literally buy them sh it, asking for rides; hell, three different people asked me if they could borrow my $3000 clarinet be

176025934,"am I a clean animal who is supposed to be eating a vegetarian diet? or am unclean and need meat on occasion. im not really sure. when I was vegan, I decided I was a clean animal and my natural diet should be plants, fruits and veggies, nuts and seeds, and gluten free grains. if you can tolerate grains like wheat more power to you but I learned to avoid most wheat pastas. then I became vegetarian, decided milk is part of my natural diet, but not eggs. this was fine. I had no problems with this diet, I was hallucinating everyday as a vegan but I wasn’t medicated. as a vegetarian no hallucinations but also medicated. then for the past month I’ve been eating meat again, but I already feel defiled and unclean, even though I have more energy and strength. also I feel incredibly guilty about it. so I think im going back to a vegetarian diet, where I won’t have any guilt. and now I have to detox, and I will once again be a clean animal who can subsist on a vegetarian diet, without the need for meat. 
I feel better already morally, I don’t know why I go back and forth so much. maybe because my family are all meat eaters and I have to ostracize myself at dinner time. im just going to stop going over to mom’s for dinner although she has been preparing more and more vegetarian meals, which im happy about. at least she’s cutting back on her meat consumption to where she is mostly plant based"

Because if you only yelled, it might be a good idea to reach out to her and explain that you’re very sorry, and you were jealous of her and lashed out. If you physically hurt her, she might be afraid if you reach out to her.

176025997,I don’t know and the pdocs probably don’t know either. But if I had to take 10mgs of zyprexa it would make me very sick. I’ve tried many APs over the years because zyprexa makes my cholesterol go high and most APs don’t agree with me at all. As you probably know it’s ‘trial and error’ and you know how it affects you better than anybody. Good luck

176026004,Or is it more believable that you are suffering from delusions?
176026005,"I trust God too, not delusional. Having this illness has made me more compassionate so in some ways it’s been good for me. Just trust your doctors and if you ever think they’re trying to hurt you, that’s a delusion. Try your best to remember that."
176026006,"I agree with this. Creating one’s own reality is actually something we’re pretty good at I get where you’re coming from, and more power to you. I just think about those of us whose symptoms are severe. That might be the only choice they have, so we’ve got to understand that this illness can take away opportunities as well.

174348376,I just got my dmg order. How should I take them? It says to take 1 pill 3 times a day. Can I take 2 pills for breakfast and 1 in lunch?
174348383,"Adrenochrome is the cause of schizophrenia’s symptoms. I feel that is the compound which links a person to the Divine, but too much spiritual influence is disruptive. Neuroinflammation causes it, so stressful situations make a person more spiritually “loud”, in a sense. More likely to be helped in one’s life, somehow. Neuroinflammation can be induced artificially in controlled amounts, so this phenomenon might be studiable. I am sure rigorous exercise can trigger this. Aspartame definitely does, so that’s like a legal psychonaut-ish approach to that. Basically the study would involve one group who prays without stress sincerely once, and gauges the quality of the following week, and another who induces neuroinflammation and does same. Also a non-prayer group who does both things. I suspect the temporarily stressed prayer group will have a better week. Fix your ego too. You don’t influence world affairs in any life altering manner with just your mind."

176026017,Try to think positive Like for every time you have a negative thought. Try to turn it into a positive one. Don’t act like the negative thought doesn’t exist. Just add a positive opinion. Think of a positive quality of what/whoever you are judging. That’s what I try to do. I think more positive this way if I can catch myself

I can’t retain information. It’s so frustrating. I’m so tempted to try anyway but we don’t have the money since we are both on disability. This really sucks.

176026041,"You have tore me apart into pieces. You have abused and hit me. You hit me with a ruler and you have hit me with your fist. I blacked out for a few seconds after you hit me. You accused me of something I didn’t do and subjected me to punishments that I didn’t deserve. You said you were my friend, but you only tore me down as I tried to make friends. You abused me, teased me, and you disfigured my soul. But you are human, aren’t you? And you make mistakes, do you not? And you made mistakes. But you are human. So I forgive you. You are, after all, human. You have imperfections and flaws. You were growing- both at old and young ages- and that is ok. Although you have damanged me greatly, you are- in a way- not responsible. If you ever find yourself in the same situation, please do not hurt another person like you have done to me. I have a scar from an injury you have caused on the top floor of a building. But don’t make the same mistake that you did on me. Don’t long on my tears but move on.

174348394,"I believe the internal mood state is a factor of how healthy a person’s blood brain barrier is. If the BBB is healthy and the brain is uninflamed, the person is just naturally happier since the person’s brain is not being subjected to physical stress. If the BBB is weakened or compromised, oxidative stress reaches the brain and manifests as some kind of mental illness. It could be as little as some anxiety, or as bad as full-blown schizophrenia."

176026079,I been on and off medications for some years now. I take them only because they keep my out of the hospital and my family wants me to. But I feel as though they make me feel sort of dull or just like nothing… I guess it feels like a indescribable nothingness… These feelings are the reason in the back of my head that I always want to stop taking my medications and figure out a way to just deal with my paranoia and delusions without going to the hospital … Is it just me or does everyone medications make you feel sort of like a dull or nothingness… Then if so do we have to accept this to stay functional or should i try a new medication

176026087,"I experienced similar, very rarely. In my case it is more likely that pain came first and hallucinations follow as if to explain the pain. Like ear or eye pain had associated hallucinations. Teeth pain didn’t, probably because it was too damn magnificent for brain to bother with showing me cartoons. Sometimes I had excruciating head aches that were accompanied with severe delusions. Actually when I mention it, I notice that since delusions and hallucinations lessened headaches disappeared too. I also had spirits controlling my body in limited capacity or preventing me from sharing certain information with anyone by controling my mouth… Not sure if its related but it is bodily. +++ My head starts to hurt! As if spirits want to prove themselves real. Its subtle though, so definitely a hallucination."

All my friends come from loving families & have loving, supportive relationships with their family members. If I was honest about my abusive family to my friends they would cut me loose as most people are very prejudiced against people from bad families. I’m guessing your next question is, “do I have a psych to talk to about it?”. No. I’ve done years of therapy and each of my therapists was so appalled by the extreme nature of my childhood family abuse they had no idea what to do with me & ceased work with me. They were hopeless, even the abuse specialists."

These functional changes can be partially explained by an increase of centrality of these regions in the functional brain network. CONCLUSIONS: N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation has a positive effect on functional connectivity within the cingulate cortex in early psychosis patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study suggesting that increased brain glutathione levels via N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation may improve brain functional connectivity."

I feel like I’ve been different people and sometimes I am convinced I am _NAME_ after googling, researching, and reading in to it heavily. It’s a made up name I’m sure. I got strange ??????? memories more than most people here that I think are real and dreams too. I think they’re from past incarnations or lives. I read a book and I might have been _NAME_ too but I don’t remember that life. I might have also almost got a job or had a job at SpaceX and ‘knew’ _PERSON_ in a past life in a parallel universe too. This is just the tip of my story here. It comes mostly in dreams, flashbacks, and memories. Maybe the whole SpaceX thing was ???????? and just a planted memory o
r fake memory, but I feel like they wanted me to work at NASA in a past life and I told them no, I rather work for SpaceX because I was a Libertarian (I’m not a Libertarian anymore – I’m a Republican). I think this whole schizophrenia diagnosis is a cop-out. Like bad doctors, hosptials, and therapists. I don’t want to admit that stuff might have happened to me as a kid and I was cloned or some ???? or abducted by aliens as young as 2 years old but probably not. I had memories my free-_NAME_ grand-father put me in ‘slavery’ via a phone call I got in a past life same thing with Monarch too (same thing? I got a phone call). I was also told I was a worker on Mars in the SSP different than a slave. And all this started way before college and in other past lives and my life has been intervened and changed mainly by grey aliens since birth and I don’t know why or really care anymore. It’s like maybe I was able to induce change in this world and it went against the NWO type people and so they gave me 
a disability and some schizophrenia and some of that crap. If _NAME_ is right and it’s all in the same reality, no 5th dimension or parallel universes, it would boggle the ??????? mind (my mind) and ????. Like maybe I’m not from a thousand different parallel earths like _NAME_ told me in a past life and crap. I believe in many worlds theory of parallel universes but then people say we are can travel along the same timeline too. Weird. It must be advanced technology they developed. Like I learned from Swerdlow that wormholes are in the same reality not a different one, so i’d be traveling in the same universe/spacetime, I guess. Titor was from another universe/dimension. Some of the stuff I created in past lives is here now being run by other people. For instance, I think I helped create energy drinks in a past life. I dated some celebrities et cetera. Maybe I made some money for other people. I don’t know how much but a lot. I don’t know how to make money anymore and could care less. It’s the last 
thing I want and it wasn’t fun or pleasant. I hated it with a passion. It feels a lot like SIMS. I ought to think of Occam’s Razor like a simple 1 timeline and time travel is being used to send things back and forth and even age regressing clones or even sending consciousness back in time (TV Show ‘Travelers’) instead of over complicating things like I usually do and sound even more delusional. I don’t have an elaborate story about Mars anymore or the moon. I believe in that stuff but I don’t have 20+ years of memories or a life there. I’m not even sure Earth is better than Mars anymore. I thought it was. My main problem is dissociation and lack of motivation – extreme lack of motivation. When I bring up painful memories, it hurts and it sends my mind back and my progress back years I think. I don’t know why I do it. To find the ultimate truth? What if there is none? I tend to do little or nothing now in my life and I’m not getting anywhere bringing up these memories. It’s like my mind c
an access parallel universes or past lives according to Many Worlds Theory of Quantum Mechanics. Is my mind in Superposition with my other parallel versions of me???"

174348449,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Do adjunctive art therapies reduce symptomatology in schizophrenia? A _NAME_-analysis. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, World journal of psychiatry , Dec 2019 19 Art therapies are advocated by national bodies, such as the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, to alleviate the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The last decade has however, seen several new larger well-controlled trials published suggesting an update is timely.To asses randomised controlled trials (RCT) of art therapies for reducing the symptoms of schizophrenia - particularly negative symptoms.Searches of PubMed and Scopus were conducted until May 2019 for RCTs examining the impact of art therapies on psychosis (positive, negative and total) symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random effects _NAME_-analyses were used to derive overall effect sizes. Moderator analyses were conducted using both _NAME_-regres
sion and categorical comparisons.We identified 133 articles, of which 9 RCTs involving 948 participants (475 assigned to art therapies and 473 controls) met our inclusion criteria. Using random effects models, we calculated pooled effect sizes (Hedges g) for end-of-trial symptomatic outcomes. Effect sizes both for total symptoms [g = -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to 0.05, k = 6] and for positive symptoms (g = -0.10, 95%CI -0.35 to 0.15, k = 6) were non-significant; however, we did find significant reduction of negative symptoms (g = -0.42, 95%CI -0.70 to -0.14, k = 9). _NAME_-regression revealed that negative symptom reduction was larger in trials with a greater proportion of women and in trials with younger patients. Crucially, the negative symptom reduction following art therapies was limited to lower quality trials and did not emerge in trials that used blind assessment of outcomes.This review presents a comprehensive _NAME_-analysis of art therapies in schizophrenia in terms of both studies in
cluded and participant numbers. We found that art therapies did not significantly reduce total or positive symptoms. A ""small"" therapeutic effect was found for negative symptoms, but we show that the effect is not present in blind trials and may be subject to publication bias."

Anything and everything they find something wrong. It has made me paranoid, severely fearful, of my thoughts, actions, and words. I’m having to be in fight-or-flight mode while walking on eggshells everywhere I go, which isn’t good at all for the mind or body!"

It was really awkward and I didn’t say anything about losing my health insurance I just said “I have a case manager who manages my work hours and I’m not sure how many hours I can work yet”. But then I said I can probably work 19. So I’ll probably do a 10 hour 5 hour and 4 hour shift. 19 hours. He seemed cool with it but I’m not totally sure. I think he understood what I meant about the case manager but I’m not sure. He seems like an understanding guy. Do you think there’s any benefit of telling him I’m disabled?? Can you guys help me.

176026352,"Hi all, thanks for this thread. I’d love to lose the weight I’ve put on with Zyprexa & then Lurasidone. I love hiking, I hike about 30kms a week & it’s pretty high intensity cardio, I get my heart rate up & sweat lots. But I also love my food!!! especially in the evenings. I’m currently trying to lower my daily food intake. It’s hard to battle the chocolate cravings but I think I’m slowly making some progress. My research shows that the best diet for me at age mid-40’s is only 15% protein & 60% high quality carbs (that’s whole grains, veggies, fruits, legumes, high micro-nutrient values like quinoa, not processed foods & cakes/chips), 25% good fats. (This fits the nutrient-sensing pathways for my age, once you get to 65yrs the pathways change & diet changes to much more protein). So that’s a bit of a surprise as most weight loss info says increase protein & lower carbs. I’m a good cook so enjoying experimenting with recipes. I’ve even got some healthy snack recipes - spicy bea
n choc chip cookies use no flour or sugar, instead black beans which give a fudgy texture. I get weighed once every 6 months at my GP. And blood tests. More alarming to me than weight gain were my blood tests 6 months ago showing elevated cholesterol due to Lurasidone. I’ve had low cholesterol my whole life & do not want to board the high cholesterol-heart disease train so considering going back to Zyprexa and cut out all animal-fat cholesterol from my diet. Hope everyone on the thread is kicking goals with their weight today. I hope I’ll see my friend _PERSON_ here and he’ll get some good tips & motivation here."

I live in the UK, mental illness is a huge financial burden on our health service, keeping people medicated and/or locked up in secure units for long periods of time, anything like this suppliment that could help sufferers would cut those costs in the long run.

176026359,Sorry for too much topics in small period of time This the last one for now
176026360,"Been watching a lot of gaia tv. Been learning a lot – tons of stuff about life and myself. Might make a post or thread about my thoughts and updated beliefs later on. I feel like ????. Like a loser and a nobody. I don’t feel comfortable talking and I don’t feel normal or alright. Like my life didn’t and doesn’t matter for some reason. I also feel like a screw up. I really screwed up my life by doing pot, but it might have been out of my control. It was a one time thing, but seems to have been a “life ruin-er” or even a “death sentence” that ruined my life and mental health and everything really for eternity in the multi-verse/simulation. I’ve been a part of stuff like in my other past lives (some cool, some special, and some bad), but in this life I think I was in the SSP (Secret Space Program) and went to Mars and the Moon – definitely Mars (as far as I can tell – sometimes I don’t think it’s real, but the testimony of others makes me think it was real combined with the 
mental breakdown and stuff. Did I go nuts on mars or the moon? I don’t know. I had and have had an extremeley boring and sad and hard life/lives. I’ve been watching educational videos on the subject and it elucidates the subject and it organizes and clears my memories and thoughts I’ve had over the years. It’s not a delusion. I don’t think this website is appropriate to talk about it because people are vulnerable/delusional and people will assume I am delusional, but I’ll be honest – I am scared. That’s why I feel like I ???? up. I could have been an investment banker (most likely not) and could have joined the military on planet earth. But my destiny or fate or my mistake (which cannot be undone for eternity) was me smoking pot among other things and I had a psychotic break. I had some trauma happened before or probably after all of this. I don’t think they enjoy us talking about such things. Fortunately, I just keep to myself. I don’t know if I was in Solar Warden or even Mars Defense Fo
rce – as of yet. But I think I was in at least one 20 year and back program in either the Navy or Marines and went to accelerated learning on the moon and got a degree in something – possibly math. I don’t really have those skills, but it felt like time was sped up and I took pills at the time to enhance my learning. I get this through dreams. I remember getting supplies and seeing aliens. But it feels like 5 minutes and another life mainly. I feel like I get nightmares of stuff and maybe all the memories will come back when I get older. It’s a pleasant feeling to watch these videos and get some memories back and piece together my life and create a picture. It feels great. I remember seeing insectoids flying on Mars, humans and bases, and supplies, and I was getting visions while simultaneously at college in the dorms. When I was at my Cooperative, I remember having nightmares and fear about giant black spiders on the walls. But I read other people’s Mars testimony of giant spiders on Mars. Maybe I 
did the pot and stuff after I came back which ruined my life and everything. I remembered too soon. I don’t know why. It was the housing environment, my weakness, my poor choices in life, and lack of integrity/willpower/morals. I posted stuff about my health and thoughts online on facebook around that time. It could have been something like project moon-shadow because I might have been an officer in outer space (hence the degree), but it just sounds so silly and crazy, but it is most likely real given my testimony and others. It’s like two separate lives and then I went 20 years back in time – 15 minutes after they took me or recruited me while I was attending college, I guess. I worry a lot. It’s a self-discovery process. I may never find out who did this to me, but I may have to settle on NEVER knowing. It could be corporations, military, interplanetary corporate conglomerate, Freemasons, and deep state, etc. ICC (interplanetary corporate conglomerate) makes sense given the altered carbon thing and 
consciousness transfer. Scary people and stuff. Corporations roaming and conquering the galaxy. I just started watching the videos on Gaia TV. I am watching the “Solar Warden” one. It just feels like I’ve been to other planet earths and crap more often not and I just want a nice, peaceful, lofty life. I feel embarassed a lot. Money would be nice, but I only need money for energy drinks and cigarettes. So it’s not something I care or want. Plus, they don’t recognize us and don’t give us money. It could be a worker/soldier thing. I don’t recall being or working on mars that long hauling supplies and going to bases. Most of my life here has been 1989-2011 and then 2011-2020. So I returned in 2011 as disabled and mentally ill. I’m glad I’m still around and lucky to be alive. I had strange lives where I went to the future and nothing was advanced or anything like my house was still there and no advanced technologies but that could have been a thing to help me cope you know - ease me in and relax 
me. I still have a lot of videos to go. I hope one day I could get some money or a pension but that will never happen. A man can dream. I rather be safe and secure and have answers because only I can figure it out with the help of other people’s testimonies and stories. They have the ability to age regress me and send me back in time and my mind is wiped. I never understood the technologies. Was my life really destroyed or was I part of something great and spectacular? Apparently up to 3000~ people were like me as far as I know according to one video. I was taken in college. Not sure how many know, but I had bad luck and a hard life too. Some timelines were horrible and nightmarish. Luckily, God has helped me survive and be happy. Thank you for reading. I might delete this if I feel too uncomfortable or paranoid. Now you see why I cannot get that much help but it was part of the logical course to take meds and see doctors and therapists because nobody has told them or my family. I don’t even trust doctors 
or therapists anymore. If you were in my position, you would feel the same way too. My family never knew I was really missing because I was only gone for 15 minutes 500+ miles a way and I didn’t even know. It all just happened so fast. It’s sort of messed up and sad but I’m a part of history, I guess."

176026374,"No I have had tinnitus long-term though. I have had the covid19 test 3 times and it was negative so no worries there. It was just weird that it went away. Could have been the coffee or something else entirely or just that I was in a good mood! I am waiting for a call back from my insurance about finding a good treatment center for the addiction. My psychiatrist just put me on Prozac. I’m a little scared to start it because of what happened with my mom when she was put on it. Also, not sure if I trust myself to take it regularly and I am not super super depressed. This was a bad idea. Idk if it’ll work right…should’ve just handled the withdrawal from the cocaine. I dont want to give myself serotonin syndrome. Should I have asked for Prozac? Do you think it will help or make things worse? My psychiatrist said my insurance will approve Prozac but not Vraylar."

174348485,"What is the potential state of sz condition itself in isolated and independent about everything in the human nature ? It means,what is the sz itself without saying one word about the diagnostic symptoms (whatever it was) or what is the structural formulation of the schizophrenia condition in the basic nature of any human being ? static state of sz The static state of the sz condition is the existential manifestations of the new living characteristics that emerged,materialized and settled in the conscious state / emotion of the person suddenly in the beginning of the third decade of life ,and the person feels and perceives them internally like he feels HIMSELF ,and you can not diagnosis these existential symptoms by any way or method The Existential Symptoms is self-diagnosing by the person only While the symptoms of disorder ( the details of the diagnostic material ) is different in the subject /content about the existential symptoms ,they are related only the observations of any external observers

If it’s warm enough they can go to the refuge and walk with us and then we can go play at the park. That’s what we did last time and it was fun. Other than that I should try to do laundry if they left the laundry room open this weekend and get the dishes done. It should be a fairly kickback day all in all. What about you?

176026396,"I was on lithium for about 20 years . I was erratic in taking it , so sometimes levels could be below the so called therapeutic range . I’m not sure how much it helped after factoring in a very supportive wife . In 2002 I was switched to Tegretol . I hardly took that because when I asked for more support a nurse told me there was only dependent personality disorder in the file on me they had.

176026417,"I barely know the Khardashian family, I never watched there shows and only picked up a bit about them from the news. I am a regent of the people, teaching everyone to be kings and queens, though perhaps not very good at it. I understand that at least one of the inlaws wants to president, though last I heard he had put that on hold. I think he’s very intelligent and gifted, but thinks too much and has problems with advice. However, it is the males of the family that I worry about the most, they all seem to get divorced. I don’t know why. Divorce is a tricky business, in some sense it is false at the highest level, love is forever, at least as far as life is, but there are discontinuities always, people coming and going, and there are directions to continuity. Besides being a regent, I am interested in just peace, which is kind of the same thing. Though being relatively poor, I have no desire to compete with such a rich, famous and powerful family, I simply want to serve. What do they really want
, they think they can have everything at the same time, a mathematical impossibility. Thank you."

I take medication I see a psychiatrist and therapist. do you guys think it can go out of my head again? any encouragement if I ignore it enough it will leave. or any advice or tips on how to try to get it out of my head again? this time when its gone I wont bring it back. _USER_ID_: oh and from what I can remember the first therapist told me, stay in the real world, if he wants to leave it will be easy to make him go"

174348510,Welcome. I have had schizophrenia for a long time and I experienced a lot of cognitive decline but eventually I got used to the meds and the illness lessened with age. It is very hard to predict how long it will take because there are different experiences. You may not know this but the newest medications are a lot better than the ones they had about 10 or 15 years ago. Sometimes you can’t tell if it is the medication or the disease that is causing problems.
176026495,It sounds like your paranoia is flaring up in my humble opinion. Maybe your volunteer work is putting too much stress on you?
176026496,I’m gonna visit my grandma today

176026507,Really? I’ve never heard that. I was told to take it with Haldol to lower the chances of side effects. It’s also always given that way in shots in the hospital.

I had problems with my emotions before the meds too tbh, so i’ll try to be more active now in order to see them back… But maybe itll be hard, yeap. The aps slow down the thinking too, which slows down the emotions I guess…"

176026511,"I got on my local pharmacy’s wait list for the Covid19 vaccine December 21st. They are 0.5 miles (0.8km) away. I emailed them a statement from my doctor that I have diabetes & emphysema and got my inhaler & diabetes med refilled there. This puts me in the 1-C group for vaccinations, being under 65 and with high-risk medical conditions. Monday, my state will begin vaccinating the 1-B group, earlier than expected. They think they will start my group April 1st. I hoping they will start my group earlier too. I spoke to the head pharmacist yesterday, and he said I was just about at the top of the wait list and would be one of the first to go in April. You don’t have a choice in which vaccine you get, Pfizer or Moderna. You can only have whichever one the Health Department is allowing at the time you go in. I’m hoping I’ll get the Pfizer vaccine as it has been shown to be effective against the variant strains of the virus."

176026514,Around New Years in 2014 I was involuntary hospitalised for Mania. Now I don’t think I have anything mentally wrong with me But I got sectioned again recently and asked a member of staff I know well if he’s ever seen me unwell and he told me about this time in hospital (2014) where I sang constantly for 12 hour straight while extremely elated. I remember it fondly and it was the best time of my life. I always think about it especially when feeling down… Do you think this was mania? I still think I’m not unwell but this can’t be normal?

They did more tests on my blood (don’t know what for) and those results came back clear so it’s obviously the medication causing it. Tomorrow we will discuss what to do. Also going to talk to her about my sex problem. I think I’m asexual. But it could be the medication. I’m not sure if any amount of aripiprazole could lower that level of prolactin so I’m worried about what’s going to happen. However if it can I will go for it.

My total focus is on space exploration. AI is meant for space not earth. I believe that once AI is above human understanding they should exit earth. As we do for the animals in forest. We decide its the nature law for a lion to feed on other animals, for which we are just viewers. AI is like the computer which has less storage of data. At present we are in a stage saying data is everything. But I feel data is not everything. For machine to find a purpose in space, it should not only have data but also evolution of machine. But anyways AI is “one small step for mankind, and a giant leap for evolution” I all ways keep wondering what is the purpose of evolution… Is it something we got to do?

How I get there is different. _PERSON_ might have talked to God and _PERSON_ might have talked to aliens or something like a higher dimension for lack of a better word. I still believe in my delusions somewhat, but want and try and am learning to ignore some of them. Like I feel some of my delusions like I know the cure for schizophrenia and cause; I built a time machine; I created things, etc. are just not worth the time or hassle convincing others or the pain I get from trying to convey my thoughts and feelings and beliefs to others. Nobody thinks I created bitcoin or I’m _NAME_ titor or was _NAME_ (_NAME_) (Rocket Engineer) in a past life and I’m an immortal alien rofl.I don’t even know. I am convinced 
I been to over a billion parallel universes or more and lived more lives than I should have or wanted to and experienced so much pain and suffering as (me). These things come to me from dreams and from past lives and probably ai/aliens and just psychic abilities among other things. A lot of these things I was told by grey aliens when they abducted me in my past lives and I still recall them through trauma and dreams. I consider myself a several/repeated alien abductee. Sometimes, it took millions of past lives to learn these things. I don’t know why I brag or share them here. Maybe I need help. I have no money, which is fine."

176026584,"When you make a topic? I’m so confused, can I make it from my phone or only the desktop?"
176026585,"It’s not your neighbors. You need to find the right meds and the appropriate dosage. I hear voices that pretend to be people in my neighborhood, but they are pretty quiet and because of my meds, easy to ignore most of the time. If you can find the right meds and take them as directed, you will hopefully be able to find some relief from your voices. Good luck _AT_MENTION_ !"

174348534,"Idk I have severe negative symptoms now, I never get out of bed. Abilify improved my negative symptoms including motivation and apathy. It did nothing for my cognitive symptoms like concentration. I am not the only one who has addictions on Abilify, other users here too, one guy here filed a complaint against Abilify and sent me the link to do the same. My psy wrote on my diagnosis SZ with negative symptoms, apathy and avolition (lack of motivation)."
176026588,There are cases of people who are still in remission without taking the medicines for a long time. But it’s not the rule . You probably need to have a very good emotional and mental control. You have to be a very integrated person. I wouldn’t advise stopping medicines without the help of a psychiatrist.

176026594,"Most meds take about 8 weeks before the benefits really show up and the side effects start wearing off. When I first started the med I’m currently on, I slept like 14 hours a night and still heard voices. But after maybe 2 or 3 months, I started going back to a normal sleep schedule as my body adjusted, and the med built up in my system. Now, I’ve been on it nearly six years, and I don’t even notice any side effects. When I added an anxiety medication, I again noticed side effects. That time, I gained about 30-40 lbs over six months, but then I stabilized. I don’t mind being a bit bigger, as long as my bloodwork keeps coming back good. If you start to notice serious side effects, like worsening hallucinations/paranoia, or suicidal thoughts, tell your doctor right away. That could be a sign it isn’t the right med for you."
176026595,"I told my therapist I was not enlightened I just had a lot of knowledge. I’ve read a lot of junk and have a great memory. But I cannot realize split. I don’t use my conscious mind much. I don’t feel like I can comprehend anything anymore and for a long time it’s been this way. I confirmed my existence by reading.

176026605,"In order to receive psychiatric services I have to see a therapist once every 3 months to keep my case open, she probably thinks she’s doing me a favor by seeing me more often. No. I had told her I’m not ready to work on anything right now with my situation the way it is I’m sort of in survival mode and the type of therapy I would be interested in with her would be to go ahead and work on some past stuff and really get in there and dig around and process and that’s more of something you do when you’re established and have the time and energy to put into it. So for now we’re just touching base and keeping the psychiatric part of it open."

174348536,"Ignoring conspiracy theories, something happened to me in college. It was real. I remember stuff. Even my mom and sister are starting to believe something happened. Some people (possibly in uniform) broke into my room, took me, drugged me, raped me, and tortured me. They took me through the kitchen through the back door in a black SUV or _NAME_. So yes, I feel it could happen again. Maybe God is protecting me. Not sure who it was or what organization. It was the government or secret government. They harassed me at the library and at the mental hospital. Even sent a rectangular ufo over my house. I’ve heard many things. Simplest explanation was mk ultra where they tried to turn me into a manchurian candidate or psychic spy. I was so traumatized. I find solace in Christ and take medication. I’ve told my doctors, therapists, social security, and my family. Even made YouTube videos and Twitter about it. My life was ruined and destroyed. There were witnesses. I’m trying to heal. I’m in a loop. T
hey said I looked at some girls ass. That I watched some video in college. Something about someone’s father. Not sure who. In my other lives, I was kidnapped from the mental hospital, severely tortured, and killed over 1000 times. They forced me to watch the TV and I was brainwashed. I remember that there was a war with Russia and the US won. I’ve been to the CIA/Illuminati facilities before in my other lives. It was scary. I could go on but I’m not. I’ve lived innumerable amount of past lives. Been taken to _NAME_ and even area 51. Don’t know what else to say. It’s real. I put my life into God’s hand and hope I go to heaven. I sometimes think I’m Q or was in a past life. Not anymore. I would say some of the things said are true or were true. Q is part of the q anon movement. I have nothing to do with it. Personally, I think it was AI outside the simulation. I’m trying to get over it. Found out we live in the matrix and aliens are real. Felt like I went to Mars where the government/illuminat
i/aliens said they wanted communism. Met some other ones where they wanted fascism. I have delusions about Russia. That the US is working with them and it’s all a mirage or scam. The reason being is they don’t want socialism in America. That there might be a cold war with China, but not Russia. That is my theory. China is the bigger threat. It takes a lot of balls to post this. I someimes fear for my life, but I am sick and tired of living with schizophrenia. They ruined my life. Ive been to hell and back and more. So, no. I don’t think anything is going to happen to you. You are safe and a good person. But me, I was targeted. I’m not angry, but I will stand up for myself and help others. I’m trying to get my story out. Everyone is ignoring me. If I die, at least I’ll know the truth. And perhaps others. Maybe someone can help me. That’s everything I’ve learned over eternity. They said I was an alien or extraterrestrial in a past life. This isn’t my first life. If there’s no evidence or pro
of then I’m from another dimension or earth. I think I might have kids but I’m not sure. It was against my will. I have no proof or evidence. Its just a hunch. I highly doubt it was aliens. I know the government/illuminati works with aliens though."

174348545,"This, as mentioned by _AT_MENTION_ is the phenomena that I am most interested in, sympathetic towards, and want to know about, in myself and others. My psychosis was this - the seeming discovery of something very unpleasant inside me. Rather than reject my psychosis, I have spent the last 30 years or so attempting to explain my psychotic experience in a way this is not ‘crazy,’ hocus pocus or what have you. There are lots of psychologists and philosophers that claim that there is a duality in the human psyche. This theory is proclaimed by very down to earth, rational theorists such as _NAME_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, and _PERSON_ and _PERSON_. I work in a department of economics, so I may be biased, but the economic aspect of these theories, as espoused by _NAME_ seems to me to be the particularly powerful motivation for the situation to continue. _NAME_ argues that it is due to the fact that we split ourselves that we engage in human economic endeavour. If we were not split we would rest when we are 
physically sated, when we have had sex, eaten, we would rest, as animals do. But if we always see ourselves from the point of view of an other which is in ourselves, then their is no end to our desire. We don’t just want a mode of transport to get to place B more quickly, a bike might do, we want a cool car, even a Rolls _NAME_ or Ferrari. We don’t want just an apple, or some rice, but sushi, and caviar. Few, if any, of these theorists explain however, how it might be possible that we can be dual or split. But there are a couple or three theorists at least (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_) that suggest (or hint) that we can spit ourselves only because the other role, other than our selves, is scary, very unpleasant, something that we do not want to see because it so horrific, and in that sense “demonic.” The nastiness-theory-of-human-splitting is not complex, but quite simple, and down to earth. Children get to know themselves from a first person perspective. They then later learn that they are that whic
h they can see in mirrors and that which can be referred to by pronouns and names. At this point, when introduced e.g. to the little person in the mirror, rather than reject their former first person self, they learn to have a relationship between the two selves.Since infants are accustomed to relationships between parents and infants they initially understand their own internal relationship in this way: that they are a parent-child diad. The problem, and nastiness, may come later when this relationship becomes sexualised. Then every taboo comes to bear. If you are playing the role of a mummy and a child and start to feel sexually self-attracted then: This internal relationship if such exists would be incestual, between a parent and child. This internal relationship if such exists would be intergenerational (between a parent and child) and yet sexual so it would be paedophile. This internal relationship if such exists would be a homosexual relationship (there is only one person in which it occurs, a person th
at is necessarily of one sex) This internal relationship if such exists would be a autoerotic (masturbatory) relationship since again there is only one person there. Then, in a paradoxical way, the overlap of all these socially condemned, abhorrent relationships, the very unpleasantness of this relationship, facilitates its continuation. If it were not for the unpleasantness, the duality would be outed, out of the closet, and then disintegrate, be unconcealed. _PERSON_ further argues that getting a whiff of the other in self, can lead to schizophrenia: paranoia, voices, anything is better than seeing the duality that is in us (as _PERSON_ said). But maybe there is a way of accepting, or even being grateful towards, nice to, loving in a non sexual way, and transforming an unpleasant relationship into a pleasant, loving (in a nice way) one."

I am going back to work, my anxiety and depression are mostly gone, and I’m usually positive. Now I feel like it’s time for me to accept the things that make me sad. Some things are that I will always be a little different from everyone else my age and I’ll always have schizophrenia, my parents aren’t going to be proud of me right now even if I work, I am living with my parents, my friends mostly have mental illness, my parents are growing old, my cousin has cancer, I spend a good deal of time on this forum or outside at the library wasting time, I’m single, meds have side effects at night. There’s probably more I need to come to terms with, but I just feel better accepting that not everything in life is happy all the time and things can’t be perfect. Accept reality. Overall I don’t have too much to complain about, though. What are some things in your life that yo
u feel sad about? Some things will get better with a good therapy program and self effort, but some won’t."

That sz is still poorly understood doesn’t prevent psychiatrists from using it in reference to what they consider to be a real disease, complex, multidimensional and highly varied in its presentation as it might be. Sz is not a diagnosis which is handed out lightly, and it has very real consequences in the real world, from benefits entitlement, to banned access to certain occupation, different treatment when facing criminal charges etc. Obviously I’m not very sympathetic towards the sz label."

176026697,I was having the same problem. Being in an environment that has a lot of junk food wasn’t helping either but I basically started drinking more water.

It wasn’t easy but eventually the urge is going away. Now I eat a banana here and there and some chocolate but other than that no junk for me.

176026701,"Hello, I understand Shizophrenia is diagnosed by existence of one or more symptoms including hallucination 2)delusion 3)disorganised speech 4)bizarre behavior coma like speech My question is in relation to delusional thoughts how a psychiatrist decides if a patient is OCD or shizophrenia. In OCD a person may have recurring doubt if he/she has ensured an act of safety as locking etc. Similarly a person may have recurring doubt of certain threat as contamination in a hospital. Could this be diagnosed as shizophrenia. I mean is it suffice to have an intruisive uncommon thought to be diagnosed or should there be conviction in the thought or belief to be diagnosed. Would be great to know what everybody thinks. Thanks in advance"

174348566,Honestly my entire schizophrenia delusion is based off of the illuminati. I’m an artist rapper and I have specific artists in my head their voices match and everything has come around that. I had messaged one of the “voices” prior to being diagnosed and losing my ???? and now it turns out the illuminati is supposedly real and they know everything about me. They are all laughing at me because I won’t “run home” Its a marathon apparently just like some music out there has claimed. It’s crazy because music Is my life and the only reason I am still alive and now I have to fight the “illuminati” every day. I don’t duck with it so I just push that away even if everything In my delusion could be real I’d rather just stay schizophrenic instead of trading in all my values and beliefs on music and people. I get treated like ???? by these voices and I refuse to give them any power. I love myself and my music and I’m not going to allow schizophrenia to turn me against one of the biggest

To top it off the person was probably young enough to be my kid. Google “why are gamers so mean to each other” and you pull up a lot of articles that are pretty interesting, including harassment of female gamers on voice chat.

The primary advantage of veganism is it prompts you to seek out a diversity of foods… And in the plant kingdom that means comprehensive nutrition. Veganism is impossible otherwise. On a practical level it’s boring… And realistically if done wrong you can miss out on key nutrients. However if you ain’t afraid of the veg… then eat them all at any opportunity you get Fruits aren’t nearly as important and meat is either artificially fortified or pretty generic in what it gives you… Protein is protein. Won’t dog on you for enjoying it. But I will target dairy as entirely unnecessary. Milk and cheese… Not really configured for much other than very very youthful life forms. Need a lot of calories and usually very specific dietary needs… Milk has been a sham for profit for some time… But yeah.

174348596,"Around the last week of August, i spoke up. I got some things off my mind that had been in my head for the last 7 years… and now, if the brain were eyes, I can see soooo clearly now. I feel tremendous. Like a new born child, like the slate is clean in my body, mind and soul. Here is how to do it. It will help with psychosis, delusions of persecution, delusions of grandeur, delusions of reference, every delusion you have, DO THIS: Write down in a journal or diary the thoughts that consume you the MOST first. Then, list the thoughts in descending order or close to it that trouble you. What you accomplished is taking the thoughts and putting them on paper, so now, your brain does not have to hold on to them. REPEAT THIS DAILY kind of like flashcards for studying, train your brain to have positive release of the thoughts so they don’t eat you up inside like they did me for 7 years, actually 15-16 years to be honest and I am almost 31. Next, speak up to your family, they are the only family you get. 
Tell them what is going on. I would get told that I need help and, them not being psychologists or psychiatrists, would refer me to doctors. Also, learn to love yourself, you are beautiful people, and being schizophrenic, bipolar, depressed, etc does not define you, it is part of you, it is an adjective yes, but you must be stronger than the illnesses. Regardless of your religious affiliation, pray. Pray now, pray at lunch, pray before exercise, pray at dinner, pray before bed. Start by giving thanks first, then apologize for what has been done second, and then ask for help third. I hope you all have a wonderful Labor Day weekend, and take care."

176026810,I’ve read that people who get sz earlier have a worse prognosis than people who get it later. I’d say on average it’s probably true. But maybe for some individuals getting sz young allowed them to learn how to live with it quicker and that could turn out to be an advantage for them over getting the illness later. So prognosis is a general forecast. But individual situations I think are a bigger marker than prognosis. It just happens to be so that your “typical patient” is a certain way. Definitely not meaning “every patient”

I was never bullied again."

You never know when the bad ones are going to sneak in and pull mental tricks on you. Smile. I know you miss them but I look at it this way.

I feel like I’ve just had a couple of espressos. And this sensation lasts all day long. My mood has lifted also.

174348602,"If I remember correctly, psychosis is a symptom or group of symptoms of schizophrenia. I was diagnosed psychosis NOS for a month or two, then I was diagnosed with schizophreniform, then a while later was diagnosed schizoaffective. So psychosis can be caused by a few different thinks ranging from substance abuse, mood disorders, and even Parkinson’s. Sometimes doctors will not diagnose something because of the _USER_ID_ around being labeled. Psychosis NOS sounds a lot less scary than schizophrenia. I’ve found any time you add the word schizo to anything people freak out. I’ve become very open about my mental health, and still I usually say I have a psychotic disorder until I know them well enough to say schizoaffective. It goes over a lot better."

My daughter’s campus has finally closed, so she’ll be coming home, but I’m a little uneasy about that. We may have a job lined up for her, though. If so, that would definitely be a good thing; she will need out of the house. I’m very, very nervous about all of this. It seems to be all I hear about and all I can think about.

176026871,"If schizophrenia is purely psychological, how does one explain the heritability of schizophenia? About 1% of the general population has schizophrenia, but monozygotic (identical) twins separated at birth (they grew up in different environments) have a 40%-50% concordance (probability that a pair of individuals will both have a certain characteristic, given that one of the pair has the characteristic) rate for schizophrenia.

176026908,I’ve had _USER_ID_. Not on any blood thinners and statins make me feel like someone beat me up. Garlic helps as it is a natural blood thinner and lowers cholesterol. That’s what my gp told me to take. But you absolutely cannot take garlic with thinners because it can thin too much and cause excessive bleeding.
176026909,yea don’t hide your issues… if you are having problems it’s ok to talk about them i think =)
176026910,Do you find the physical act of talking to be easy? I used to get very tired when talking but managed to increase my stamina by reading out loud from a book for half an hour per day. I also trained away the monotone in my voice by singing karaoke on youtube for 20 minutes each morning. If you found it easier to physically speak then this might increase your confidence. Even if the training only gave a placebo effect it might be enough to change things.
176026911,Sz for me is pretty much akin to surfing. You ride out the bad times and you enjoy the good. We are all different how we handle it but if you’ve been doing it awhile you’ll get an idea of what your symptoms are like. You learn what makes you worse or helps and you learn when you really need help. It’s up to you but if you can make it to morning it’s probably a good thing if you can get some sleep. Sleep is so good for resetting the brain and giving you a different perspective… Even then. These days you need to let your doctor know what your going through…keep on your treatment and keep stress low…

Thourough counseling, cognitive speech therapy, spiritual assistance could have had better outcomes and probably would be cheaper too. Meds arent what I believe in either. They are what my mother believed in and she continues with that. She doesnt listen to anything ive said, so i have to lie to her unfortunatly about taking them. And, whats my crime?

176026933,"i was on sustenna for 3 years or more and have been on trinza for 4 months now. the first year and a half of sustenna was terrible. the only joy i had was eating and i put on 30 pounds. all i did was sit on the couch. then after about a year and half i started to get emotions back and my anhedonia started to lift. im still not as joyous as before, but i don’t often get depressed anymore. i love trinza so far, im not even getting night time voices like i had on sustenna. and also im losing weight, almost back to my pre medicated weight. im almost happy i would say, and have been able to workout some even. they say sustenna and trinza are the same thing, but for some reason the trinza is much more effective for me. im on the highest dose though."

176026935,I’m angry about a relationship I allowed myself to get into. Because of the consequences. I don’t like the kind of person he is yet he lives in my area so I’m hoping to not bump into him. Which sucks. I don’t want him on my mind. So I try not to think about it but of course it is in the back of my mind. Apart from that I’m generally peaceful although I do get my angry moments usually connected to my fragility.
176026936,_AT_MENTION_ I get only one week after my one year anniversary and that’s not till August. I do have some money in saving now so I won’t completely bottom out if I take time from work but I’m trying to stay in consistent work. I don’t want to lose my job

176026958,"That sounds very serious and frightening _AT_MENTION_ . I hope your doc can give you helpful advice or meds change. I recently went back on Zyprexa and instantly became a food vacume. Ridiculous food cravings & appetite. (It didn’t help my psychotic symptoms so I’m tapering back to Lurasidone). I try to do age-appropriate exercise every day. I’m in my mid 40’s & from the research I’ve done the best exercise (most benefits, least risk of damage) is short workouts of high intensity interval training. I try to get my heart rate up every day, just in short bursts. Don’t know if something like that may be of help to you? There may be some kind of workout that is safe & effective for you to do with your heart condition. Good luck with your doc."

174348629,"Hello everyone! So, I have been on Invega for a few months now. When I first took it my mind was BLOWN! I had no hallucinations, no delusions, my cognition was so far back on track that I could remember every detail of my past (even with my disorder) and still be normal again! After a few days I started to become depressed because it felt like I had missed out about 11 years of my life even though I participated in much more than I realized. Then a few more days I started having a “flat effect” mixed with depression. My doctor said I was going through psychosis. After two weeks the medication just stopped working. I then switched to Abilify which made me much, much worse being misaligned with reality. So… I went back on Invega and until recently I quit my job because of the hardship the company put me through. I am in the process of getting medical help with the county. I have a few tablets left to last me about 20 days and I have been taking phosphatidylcholine which helps me remember things
. So I have been reading that Invega is an active metabolite is Risperidone. I also saw most people have unnerving side effects of taking it. I have taken it back in 2015 with really bad side effects too but I honestly dont know if the same will happen this time. So I was wondering if any of you have switched from Invega to Risperidone and if it was less effective, just as effective, or more effective than Invega. I am asking because I have a choice between taking Risperidone which is 4 USD or Geodon about 35 USD."

176026980,Is this site hack proof?
176026981,What do you mean?
176026982,Wild running commentary
176026983,I received information that the loxapine I use as a supplement to paliperidone is on back order in every pharmacy in the city I live in. I am out and am experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms. (I take a relatively small amount but it is helpful.) Are you guys experiencing it too?
176026984,Make an appointment. I haven’t been the biggest fan of talking on the phone since getting sick. Stick to meal plan. Shower.
176026985,"I get constipation as a side effect of Zyprexa. I take 2-4 Citrucel caplets a day and now I have started eating a big bowl of raw veggies as an afternoon snack. The extra fiber really helps. My daily fiber goals on my Sparkpeople ranges are 25-35 grams of fiber per day. Before the veggies, I was always around 17-18 but the veggies bump me up to meet my fiber goals every day. Maybe extra fiber wouldn’t help you though - you are on a vegan diet so you must already be getting a lot of fiber. When I was vegan, I would sometimes get as much as 75 grams of fiber in a day! I keep a laxative on hand for when things get bad like you are experiencing, like every 10-12 weeks. As long as you don’t take them too often, they generally work in no more than 24 hours. Good luck!"
176026986,"Also I got 1 scholarship offer, but it was a division 3 school. I didn’t go to that school because it was division 3 and I thought it was a smart school like _NAME_…so I didn’t want to play soccer there. but I did something better. I tried out for a Jr. college, and made the team. I still was only like 11 percent out on the field. Therefore I didn’t start, but I started the first game. I don’t know why I didn’t start the rest of the season."

176027000,23andme says i have a high genetic risk for type 2 diabetes. I guess it figures.
176027001,I think it is enevitable though that it is going to infect a large proportion of people. I think the question is how long are the schools going to be closed? 3 months? 6 months? I think it would be more appropriate to close individual schools at the moment and try and maintain things like people getting their education.
176027002,"It sounds like a interesting supplement. I tried similar supplements that work on neurons in the brain, like GABA and Tryphtophan. Gaba made me more relaxed, but triggered involuntary movement. Tryptophan helped me sleep, but spawned symptoms of relapse. They clash with the olanzapine. I might try this one too though at some point, although I might not be able to use them as it’s in the same category as the above, but you never know."

I was in crisis from it and somewhat didn’t even care to do anything about it. Got to the point where I could barely move. I felt like my brain was dying because I felt no pleasure or motivation, or anything, just stuck. But I tried a new med dosage and I am having a better day. My point is Ive just had 2 days that were a little better so this may be a bad time for now. It sounds hard. Are you getting enough sleep? That can affect me."

176027006,This little boy must be only 4 or 5 years old. But he keeps hiding in my closet waiting for me to open it to jump at me and scare me. I try to just talk to him in a calm voice and tell him I don’t like playing these kinds of games. Then he’ll whimper and cry next time I see him. At work while I was cleaning rooms he just kept standing in the door way watching me clean as he just stood there and cried. I felt bad for making him cry but I’m pretty sure he’s just a hallucination after using my deductive reasoning. But I’m having a hard time accepting that he isn’t real because I’ve never hallucinated real physical people before. Just shadow figures and mostly it’s just voices and paranoia and sometimes paranoid delusions. Is _NAME_ real? He could just be a friend of my roommates kid who is about the same age but that doesn’t explain how he follows me places.

176027012,"It took me 1.5 years to ask the doctor what was it, I had diagnosed with. I currently take aripiprazole 20 mg and olanzapine 5 mg for past 3 years with mg variation. But I was not treatment resistant, I knew from the start there is something off with my thoughts. I was also just reminded by pdoc that if I don’t take my meds he would admit me to the hospital. By the way past 10 years with downs and ups was like a _USER_ID_ ride enjoyed every moment. The best thing I learnt with meds, don’t doubt and face everything, main thing is show up even if its a bad day. I know its easy to say all this but there are people much better experience than me who are living life. Its just that it takes time for the meds to stick with all side effects and hopefully for me side effects did not last for long about 2 to 3 months main one was me shaking the whole bed while a sleep."

176027022,Rouge one is right. When we’re feeling bad a lot of us tend to think in black and white about our lives. How many people come on here one day when they’re having a shitty day and say how shitty their lives are and their whole life has been one constant failure and a week or two later they are having a good day and all of sudden life doesn’t look so bad and they might remember some good times or successes in their life?
176027023,"You’re gonna hear a lot of people telling you never to touch another drop of alcohol again. I am of the opinion that just because you’re on medication or have a condition, you shouldn’t be forever locked out of what is a large part of American society. I drink on Fourth of July every year, this year is actually an exception because I don’t have a car or someone nice living with me that cares enough to ask if I need something. Of course you have to be well enough to exercise responsibility, and if you are really bad off with your sz/sza, which you don’t seem to be, you probably shouldn’t touch it. It’s annoying to hear someone tell you not to do something because you’re sick. You didn’t choose to be sick, and if the other person all of the sudden had a condition, would they never drink or party with their friends again because of it? That’s a lot to ask a person."

176027031,"You have to weigh the your evidence of a balance of probabilities. Ask yourself, do you ever recall anyone implanting a hidden camera inside you? If not, why do you insist on it? I know it is based on your “evidence” of TV and people talking about you. As people have mentioned, why would anyone want to implant a hidden camera inside of you to talk about you? You are not an important person in any respects, no offence. You are not an important political or corporate person, nor a celebrity. You are also not a criminal. Why would anyone ever keep taps on you. I presume, due to your parnaoia, you also stay inside the house all day. When would anyone ever get the chance to implant anything into you? Despite your “evidence” of hearing people and TV talk about you, there has been no evidence of why people would want to do so. You also have no recollected memory of such an event happening. That is why there is no hidden camera inside you."
176027032,My mother said i give schizophrenics a bad name. This is coming from the woman that said for years i was making it up - and it took one of my private clinic letters to prove otherwise that i had it. Now just cos my sister printed off the wiki article on it - she thinks she knows all about the disease and how people cope with it. Her arrogance is bloody outstanding. Shes a damn “ambulance chaser” anyway. Everytime you speak on the phone - shes giving you step by step details on “how ill she is” for half an hour before you get a word in. Its like she wants to play medical Top Trumps - to prove shes more unwell than i am lol. Bloody pathetic woman. lol.
176027033,"As from your previous posts, I can assume you tried every medication on massive dosages. The only thing i can suggest is waiting for new medication being released."

176027035,It’s called synchronicity. Some people think it’s real – even normal people. Some people are more prone to believing paranormal things and the matrix stuff.

174348653,"I have a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I have had two episodes and have been told I need medication for life. Unfortunately I gain 1kg or 2,2 pounds on average per week whilst on medications. I have tried every weight neutral drug on the market as well as a couple of others and they all make me gain weight. I have tried dieting and exercise and cannot lose the weight. I have tried metformin and topiramate and they do not cause weight loss. I have put on 35 kg or 77 pounds in a year. The weight gain does not plateau. I cannot keep taking the medications due to the rapid weight gain. I will end up not being able to work or take care of myself.at some point in the near future. I lost all the weight I gained after my first episode because the psychiatrist said I could come off the drugs. Going off the drugs is the only way I can lose the weight. I am thinking of going off the medication for a couple of months, losing some weight and then going back on them for a couple of months (and repeating this patte
rn until I lose what I have gained). I do not want to go off the medication but at the same time I cannot stay on it indefinitely if the weight gain never stops. My doctor and at least 2 psychiatrists have said they cannot help me any further regarding my weight. Has anyone been in the position of constant weight gain despite trying diet/exercise/weight loss medications/different AP’s? What worked for you if anything? I am at a loss and it makes me miserable and very stressed knowing the only two options I have are never ending weight gain or risking another episode…"

176027086,"This is interesting about smoking: Cigarette smoke contains over 3000 different chemicals. Some of these chemicals can make some of the enzymes in the liver work faster (called enzyme induction, mainly of the enzyme CYP1A2 or P4501A2). This means that any medicine those enzymes break down will be broken down quicker. So, you’ll end up with less of that medicine if you smoke. And also you will have more of it in the body if you stop smoking. However, amisulpride does not seem to be affected so there seem to be no extra problems if smoking with amisulpride."

After my initial break I became pretty stable for years. Later when I relapsed in the late 1980’s I did check myself into some wards a few times. I called the police a few times to drive me to hospitals. The third time I did that the cop told me they really didn’t want to do that and told me basically that taking people to wards was not in their job description and I should not call them anymore. But I did stuff like find psychiatrists for myself, I found the board & care myself that I spent 5 years in from 1990-95."

Having one doesn’t mean you will magically change your mind. I have 6 and still dislike other kids. I even dislike my own at times. It’s hard and messy and awful a lot. Other times it’s amazing and you wonder how you could ever love so much. To have kids is a very personal thing to choose. It is your choice and never let anyone make you feep bad for being child free."

176027171,I think what it does illustrate is(a) How much it costs to provide support and (b) We have a mental health system that provides good support for some while failing to provide reasonable support for many .

176027175,"I’ve never had really dramatic mania like that thank gosh. I don’t like mania though. Frankly, I’m scared to death of it because of the textbook descriptions of it. Mainly, the parts where it describes “wild spending sprees”, and “jumping out of tall buildings”. Those parts scare me to death and I don’t want to go there. Personally, my manic episodes have always revealed themselves in hypersexuality (in the past), (I’m totally asexual now), staying up all night, and composing music every day for years and years, often all night long."

Of course the hallucinations followed me all the way (getting worse) into adulthood.

174348675,I was in IOP and I met this girl and I was reminded of this by the firefighter guy. But the girl was talking about her schizophrenic sister. And like talking badly about her about how she’s no longer her sister to her and it was sad. But I went up to her after the group and I told her I was sza. And I used to be really bad but finding right meds helped me. And I told her about family.sz.com and she was like wow that’s amazing. I don’t think she understood I was sz too. She said something right in front of me later on “she obviously doesn’t think like any of us”. Maybe It didn’t register I was like her sister at that point because I was on meds and doing kinda well and stuff. But maybe later hopefully her relationship with her sister got better. Maybe I helped her understand there’s hope for recovery. Maybe the sister is med compliant now and stuff. She wasn’t. I’m not sure I didn’t keep contact.

176027183,I started flying again. I probably shouldn’t have. I have been twice in the last two weeks and go again next Saturday. My aim is to get a biannual flight review which means you are safe to go flying alone and carry passengers. I have no intent on doing that though. Every time I fly I will be with an instructor. I want to get current again so I can get signed off for my drone license. Saturday I plan on asking my instructor how many more lessons I need to get the check ride. I probably just should have studied for the test. It would have been a lot cheaper. But if you are a current manned pilot the FAA will give you your drone license without the test. You just have to take an online course. I am going to try and get a job flying drones next year. You don’t need a medical for that and it can’t be that hard I don’t think.

176027185,"I don’t think this sounds weird at all. Giving you grades all semester is hand-holding. It’s a higher education and you need to learn not just your courses but also how you deal with this difficult process, with the uncertainty and with tracking your progress on your own, without constant help from your teachers. The most important thing you’ll learn is the mindset and the process, not the facts. We have no hard rule against getting grades before the final exam, but we generally don’t get any, and when we do, they usually count for half the final grade and are large projects. It doesn’t make me question my progress, because I have learned to evaluate my progress on my own. The first exams were very stressful, though, because of the uncertainty."
176027186,"Yeah thanks for the advice! It may have turned out for the better, I sort of hope for the best. According to some of the statistics say 50 percent sort of recover, but in reality I have no idea how accurate that stat is, after all that’s just stats, but hopefully that is true."

174348699,"Abstract Objective: Women with schizophrenia appear to receive breast cancer diagnoses at later stages of the disease compared with the general population. To study this disparity, this report reviewed and quantified the differences in rates of mammography screening for women with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders compared with the general population. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. Each database was searched from inception to September 14, 2018. The search strategy included search terms for breast cancer, mammography, schizophrenia, and psychosis. Two reviewers independently screened and evaluated eligible studies. The main outcome measure was the rate of mammography screening among women with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders versus a comparable population of women without these diagnoses. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and _NAME_-Analyses guidelines were used for abstracting data, and 
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for assessing data quality. A _NAME_-analysis with a random-effects model was performed. Results: From a total of 304 abstracts reviewed, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing 25,447 women with diagnoses of schizophrenia or psychosis across four countries. The _NAME_-analysis showed that women with schizophrenia were less likely than women without schizophrenia to receive mammography screening (pooled OR=0.50, 95% confidence interval=0.38–0.64, p<0.001). In subgroup analysis, this association was not significantly affected by quality of the study. Conclusions: Women with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders were about half as likely as the general population to receive mammography screening. Further research is needed to determine causes of this disparity. https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps._PHONE_NO_"

Can’t say I can recommend this sativa strains to people with anxiety though. It’s not so calming as the indica or hybrid strain. I also had a cbd panic attack in 2015 when I took a “depression reducing strain”. That must’ve been sativa too. But I said “I’m depressed, sounds good to me” without factoring In that I’m anxious too. So if you have the option, make sure you get indica or hybrid cbd if you’re given the choice and you have anxiety. At least that’s what I’ve experienced. Maybe everyone is totally different though.

176027323,"What do you think would settle the question if you pretended or not? Faking or pretending has to do with intention. Ordinarily, you do not come to know your own intentions in retrospect. It is quite similar to how you cannot lie without knowing you’re lying."

174348716,"In hindsight my first foray into mental illness probably happened around 19-20 but it was mild and I didn’t recognize my problems as being related to mental health, mental health wasn’t even on my radar. Things got progressively worse as the years went by and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 26."
176027326,"To be honest, I’m 42 and no I don’t really look it. In response to how young I might go for, I’d say I wouldn’t go for any younger than their mid-20s. There are a few women from my past that have kind of re entered my life in the last several years, but I don’t want anyone from my past. So no, I don’t have anyone in mind. Even though I value looks and intelligence very highly, I also know that she would have to have a heart of gold to boot."
176027327,Yeah it is sad to see my schoolmates that were worse than me at school graduate in important universities and hold good jobs while I have only a middle school graduation because of mental illness.
176027328,"Thanks, sometimes i think sz got seven lives. like cats. I wanted to go to triage in psychiatry, but they can’t do anything. I already had electric shock therapy. And the trauma is coming back."

174348725,"I think CBD works better than antipsychotics, and it will be years before it’s approved. I just got some. I took about 500mg. I think that would be a good dose for me. Anxiety requires 300mg, schizophrenia-800 mg. It made all the things bothering me, seem far away, or way toned down."

176027338,"Yes, flexjobs.com is one place you can find them."
176027339,No you’re not. If that’s how you feel you should work with a therapist for a while. It’s not good walking around feeling like that.
176027340,"The trick is when this happens is not to venture into the entrapment of the voice/s as it seems like they will try to create a trauma bond within your psychological association so you can be triggered by it, it’s like being psychically blackmailed You can also create a psychological deviation by saying something off topic in order to throw it off course, try saying stuff like I don’t have $5 Dollars, and just repeat it to yourself out loud or silently to yourself. Also have a positive avatar something you can fight with, something that means something to you, with which to ride out the storms, I hope some of these silly though free methods help you, as they have with me."
176027341,Mine aren’t funny but they aren’t mean like a lot of people have to deal with.
174348717,Other than more meds does anyone else have any advice on how I can cope with this?
176027342,whats up with halodol why does it look like everyone is smiling at you i took a rispradol the dock gave me and I don’t care
176027343,"Hey everyone I’m new here. I’ve been going back and forth on invega sustenna for years now. It’s been 4 years of hell. The doctors keep putting me on it even though it always makes me lactate. They say it’s the best med for me which I don’t get, because since I’ve been on it my mood has been very low and I feel way more depressed. I was misdiagnosed with pychosis back in 2016. They keep putting me on the shot because my “family” thinks I’m crazy. I ended up getting in a program called fact team thinking they would help me get my disability and get my own apartment and they ended up putting me back on invega. I’ve been on it since Janurary of this year. They wont let me get off it. I don’t wanna be on this med. Any advice on what I should do? My prolactin is very elevated as well it hasn’t went down cos they keep putting me on it. My mom wont let me get off it either. Any advice on what I should do? Thanks for reading."

176027350,insomnia sucks… its super scary for me…
176027351,"Oh you edited it. I meant emotions not necessarily romantic love, I didnt explain good. I do self destructive behaviors and dont love myself anymore, I am indifferent to my well being and health. I stay in bed 90-95% of my time almost catatonic. I had catatonia off meds and on low dose meds."
176027352,Not a good option as it could lead to way worse outcomes. Need to talk to doc. A change in dosage or med could help. It’s common with ap’s. I get it a little on zyprexa but it’s not a deal breaker for me…it’s still there though.
176027353,Too much raises blood pressure which may cause headaches. Moderation is good.

176027360,Good. I will send her a text let her know
176027361,I think anyone who decides they are ready to die in their thirties when a doctor hasn’t even diagnosed them with anything terminal is suicidal.
174348719,I have sza and I suffer from micro-psychosis. Most of the time I’ve spent psychotic has been in small chunks where I would go in and out allowing me to still hold it together mostly. It was an internal torture I was experiencing. Onlookers might not even recognize that something was going wrong with me. I could have it for hours to a day or days. Stress and anxiety triggers it.
176027362,I can suspend you for the time you want.
176027363,the best sleep I get is when I stick to a plan and be productive enough. that is kinda rare!!!

176027371,"This is the fundamental problem of mental illness. It’s also the problem in original music. Do I disclose sch to the interviewee? If so, how forcefully? Maybe I hold on to some dignity by leaving out the 100% truth and be human a little and lie 10%? In music the key not is decided by the very beginning clear tone and the last. In relationships the person who first speaks is the leading person, but they also revealed part of their mistake This probably doesn’t make perfect sense. That’s fine. I can relate.

176027373,I miss cigarettes.
174348723,"I see young people on reddit all the time saying they think they have schizophrenia when even doctors have told them they don’t. I don’t think they want to have schizophrenia as much as their anxiety about illness is pressing them to think they have it. A lot of people really don’t know as well that when one develops schizophrenia, they typically don’t have insight to it, so it’s not like you just decide one day that you are schizophrenic and you start meds, its more like a painful journey of others saving you that we all have experienced in our own awful ways. I think there is something interesting as us as people with madness, but I think people really only like to see it when we are stable. I told one of my friends who is very open to hearing about my psychosis that I had spent much time around her in psychosis, without her knowing. She said it didn’t matter to her, because she was never “scared.” I gave her a stern look, and she quickly corrected herself and apologized for sayin
g that my diagnosis can make me scary. I think my friends find me talking about my delusions as almost a juicy gossip for them, whatever that means, but when I’m actually psychotic they don’t really like it much at all, as I don’t make much sense and jump to ridiculous conclusions."
176027374,No because theres No shops here.
176027375,Or is it none of their business
174348736,"I sometimes have mania and depression. I don’t know if depression is from negative symptoms. Even my psychiatrist couldn’t differentiate them. He prescribed me an antidepressant Wellbutrin for a month but it didn’t change anything. Sometimes I am overexcited, I talk too much and jump from one subject to an unrelated subject with no goal in mind. When I am manic I can’t sleep, I sleep at 3 AM when it happens. I took lithium (Supplement) once by myself and I felt better but sleepy. I don’t see anything about both disorders together on medical websites, only SZ and drug addiction."

176027382,"I was unfortunate enough to be involved in drugs from age 11. My life now is miles ahead of where I ever thought it could be despite my problems.

176027391,I can see why most people would not think a list like this is fun but in a weird way I’m kind of proud of it. It’s a lesson in perseverance for sure. But also a ridiculous number of jobs to be fired from. On the other hand I was successful at many other jobs. I worked three years at HP. Four years at Sears. 2 years as a park ranger etc. What’s your list if you want to give it? 1978-1979 Busboy at restaurant Carpet cleaning Driving job Gas station Tobacco company Gas station Restaurant prep cook Restaurant prep cook again Carpet cleaner again Hospitalized and group homes 1980-82 1983– Hot tub technician Prep cook Clothing warehouse HP warehouse Target _NAME_’s _PERSON_’s

176027397,They put me on the Invega Sustenna shot and started me on Lithium. They stopped my Lamictal and Zoloft.
176027398,They wouldnt let my husband who is my carer in to the room with me and thats when they talked to me like i was crap / the man said YOU DONT HAVE PSYCHOSIS ( Its me thats hearing them not them how would they know ) and i just need to sleep when i have called them they tell me to have a bath or have a cup of tea ( during the day ) and sleep ( at night ) because they need to keep the beds free ( number of beds limited as its the nhs and they get government funded ) FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE REAL PROBLEMS
176027399,"Me too. I love exploring my own and other people’s natal charts, especially when they are sceptics and don’t believe in astrology as being anything other than a scam, because when their charts are spot on about their personality traits and their character and how they deal with different aspects of their lives they have all gone away completely more open minded and accepting of astrology than they we’re before; it’s extremely satisfying."

174348757,"Withdrawal, social isolation, and lack of motivation. I guess a pdoc would call these negative symptoms. The only times I leave my apartment is to attend church, go to my doctors appointments, and volunteer twice a week. Sometimes, I go over to my friend’s house but that is getting rarer and rarer. I have only one friend to my name and she is getting very infrequent. Which is ok by me because I don’t like her anymore anyway. She has proven not to be much of a friend. I really should cut her loose completely. And I know how you all feel about that. My mood is good, which is surprising. She has sent me through the wringer so many times that she really doesn’t affect me anymore. She can’t. I am immune. I don’t love her anymore. I haven’t in quite a while now. She’s just a blob taking up space in this business called life. What I really need to do is learn how to make other friends. That, I’ve never been very good at. I didn’t have any friends in high school or college or in my late 2
0’s or early 30’s. I made my first friend since grade school when I was 37 years old. I hung on to her until I was 51 when my son died. Then, I made a friend out of this current woman I’m having problems with now. I am now almost 60 years old. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had many female lovers throughout my life but very few platonic friends. I don’t know how to make platonic friends. I never have. I wouldn’t know how to acquire a lover nowadays, at my age, either. Nor would I want to. My question is, how do you acquire female, platonic friendships when you have negative symptoms of withdrawal, isolation and lack of motivation? And also positive symptoms of thinking people find you “weird”, “disgusting”, “crazy”, “gross”, etc…etc…"

You can’t go back in time and stop yourself from eating that cake. A wish of mine is I wish I can work and read books. It feels like sz is stealing me.

All my listening experience was in rock and pop music from the 1960’s to the early 2000’s. In meditation tonight, I got the epiphany that the reason I struggle so much on the piano with my classical piano pieces is because I usually have no idea what the piece is supposed to sound like. So, I’m shooting in the dark when I play. I think I’m gonna tell my current teacher that I want to play both classical pieces and classic rock and pop tunes from now on.

Invega for example kicked my butt with side effects but some on here swear by it."
176027521,i hope you feel better soon… you should talk to your doc about the 15mg dose though so you can keep taking it… going back to 10mg when you are feeling bad doesn’t sound good.

They could easily be watching us and making TV shows and putting them in reality. Just like the movie the Matrix.

176027534,"hi _AT_MENTION_ I always feel negative & angry rather than negative & tearful. But I get what you mean. I have always been this way, since childhood. I didn’t find therapy useful either. I developed insights into what caused me to become permanently negative & angry. Those insights were of no practical or emotional use. I rely on meds & avoiding stress to feel ok & manage symptoms. Lurasidone isn’t helping much so I’m considering going back on Zyprexa. Are your meds helpful? Do you feel therapy may get better in time? Do you feel that therapy is doing you harm? Can you distance yourself from close ones who won’t accept you, meet some new people, develop new friendships with people who accept you?"

Triterpenes, known as galphimines, were identified in this species. One of them, Galphimine-B (G-B), acts selectively on dopaminergic neurons by antagonizing the effect of glutamate on NMDA receptors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of G. glauca methanolic extract (GgMeOH), a Galphimine-Rich Fraction (GRF), as well as the galphimines G-A, G-B, and G-E, on the acute psychosis induced by Apomorphine (APO) in mice and on schizophrenia-like symptoms induced by subchronic administration of MK-801.On the first day, ICR male mice were given GgMeOH, GRF, or one of the galphimines. On day two, animals were 
treated with APO, and on day 3, they were subjected to behavioral tests. In a second test, MK-801 was administered daily for 28 days. In this case, animals were treated daily with G. glauca products from day 9 to day 28 and then subjected to behavioral tests (passive avoidance test, open field test, forced swimming test, and social interaction test).The increased number of stereotyped behaviors and grooming behaviors induced with APO were counteracted by all of the experimental treatments. MK-801 induced an increase in immobility time, which was blocked with G-B; GRF counteracted the decreased social interaction, and GgMeOH and GRF prevented the memory loss induced by MK-801.G. glauca and their derivatives products (GRF and galphimines) were able to interact with the dopaminergic and glutamatergic drugs and to block different behaviors associated with some of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of induced schizophrenia in mice. It is necessary to continue with this research, in order to identify th

176027587,"If it’s not just irrational thoughts of suicide, if a person is not able to wait for years for it to end because they suffer unbearable torture, if there is no better alternative because their condition is treatment resistant, and if they want it, then I’d say they should be allowed to end their torture and it would be a humane thing to allow it. There are people for whom medication and therapy hasn’t helped. One could say that in theory those people haven’t tried hard enough. But as far as they’re concerned they’ve tried everything. Lack of knowledge of what would help is as good as treatment resistance - effectively there’s no difference, because either way they’re not getting help. I’ve been even told there is no such thing as a rational suicide. Unbearable feeling is not just an irrational thought. I don’t expect people who haven’t suffered from an unbearable condition to understand this, or to understand how much a person can suffer due to a mental condition, like some ca

The schizophrenia aerobic exercise group showed a significant increase of cortical thickness in the right entorhinal cortex at week 6, and we found a significant correlation between the cortical thickness of the right lateral prefrontal cortex at baseline and improvement of social adaptation at week 12. In the schizophrenia table soccer and healthy control groups, we found no significant longitudinal change in cortical thickness through the intervention and follow-up period and no correlation of cortical thickness at baseline with clinical measures. Our results suggest that aerobic exercise in schizophrenia modulates the thickness of the entorhinal cortex, a structure adjacent to the hippocampus. Greater cortical thickness of the right lateral prefrontal cortex appears to predict better clinical 
response to an aerobic exercise intervention in patients with schizophrenia."
176027615,I’ve had a few end of the world dreams but most of my dreams are like…forshadowing to me or they help me with life somehow. Like once I dreamt about my dad after he passed away that he sent me a message in a bottle that washed up along a beach saYing he was in the heavens overseeing the world. I’ve had one where I was going through flashbacks of bullsht from my child hood and having issues in my relationship because of it. The setting was the same as when my dad sent me a message and I received a giant rose quartz from the ocean. I Google when I woke up and learned that rose quartz means self love and forgiveness. But dreams are your subconscious manifestation so I would think if your dreams are only bad scary and unhelpful you would probably dealing with some unidentified anxiety triggers throughout the day maybe?

174348796,"During the effect of the basic schizophrenic process (psychotic process),the person has becomes in a state of mindfulness meditation ( full thinking process ) The whole psychotic process takes time equivalent to both the inhalation / exhalation process, it repeated periodically one after other throughout the period time of waking . and implicitly includes a homogeneous bundle of a dynamic imaginary scene,an idea pronounced phonetically,auditory perception and ends with a deceptive feeling expression in the general frame,the psychotic process is a united package consist of an image, a motor expression,heard thought and a feeling -One of the important function of the brain has been appeared during the effect of psychotic process, -The brain has seeks to regulating the speed of the signal that carries a mental concept as it moves from one cell to another ( or one region to another ),in order to make this speed appropriate for the person ability to comprehend the concept and understanding its connotati

Rather,the problem is in the regions that receive the self’s signals and real
izing their implicit concept, Because these regions (receptors) are the same areas that receive the malicious signals that emanate from the psychotic factor !! We can offer a materialistic example to explain the secret of the process You have to imagine a virus consisting of a DNA /RNA associated with (linking with) the RNA of a human gene ,in this position it has the ability to receiving the information that it decoded into the human RAN ,then it convert it into pronounced information ,then modifies its concept and send the modified concept to the regions that are supposed to receive the human RNA messages !!

When I am like this I try to keep water in my mouth and not swallow. Please no intrusive thoughts I am telling myself. How do I cope?"

I was a chronic alkie and drug user just before the SZ hit. Being clean and sober makes me a lot more functional than I was even with the SZ as a monkey on my back. No complaints!"
174348853,"Ya, same here. Mine is extreme I think. Borders narcissism. I think I am very, very intelligent, but the schizophrenia affects it so much that I cannot function and express it. I think my IQ before schizophrenia was 130-140 and now it’s 110-120. But I think IQ is fluid and those tests aren’t that representative of creativity, success, drive, and intuition. It mainly is used to see if you can do clerical work lol as _PERSON_ stated. I think I was stupid growing up because I never studied, tried, or applied myself. I felt dumb growing up, especially in college where I could not achieve A’s in my math classes. I felt like a failure. Math is a passion and a field I excel in but there are people who are prodigies and I was never one. Mathematics is a young man’s game. I think I’m good at abstract thought and thinking outside the box. Case in point: Simulation theory. I often think I’m one of the most intelligent people on the planet or in history rivaling _PERSON_ lol. Mainly all of this com
es from dreams and aliens… I believe I’m an alien abductee that has been abducted and experimented on several times. I don’t want to talk about it because it causes issues here… I had dreams of past lives where my IQ was 150-180. I’ve heard of people having IQ’s of 200+, but there’s other things involved like inventions and creativity and success in mathematics and science. _PERSON_ created relativity and revolutionized physics for years to come. I feel like my IQ was lowered purposely and that I was given schizophrenia on purpose by either the government or by aliens… It sounds absurd and narcissistic but I also believe I have psychic abilities. I have thought I had schizotypal autism because of this. I have been diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder – depressive type and Aspergers…on the extreme end of schizotypal disorder, you get negative aspects and lowered IQ. Some interesting tid bits: I’ve been outside the simulation and helped run and develop it. I was in the Illuminati and e
scaped and came up with a lot of interesting and sucessful things that were stolen from me. One thing I came up was Conformal Cyclic Cosmology. For some reason, Sir _NAME_ got it or discovered it independently. While I never succedded in math, I feel like I came up with the idea in college. I believe it was stolen via time travel or the thoughts were inserted into his head. It’s based on relativity and is a theory on cosmology."

Thats my experience anyway. I also deal with the manias and depressions. At one point I actually thought I was no longer having bipolar issues and that id never get mania again. well after 2-3 years without manias they came back and I keep going into hypomanias. So what I am saying is these illnesses never go away, you just have to manage and prepare for the worst. Develop as many good coping strategies as possible. Take meds that help you. Then you will be okay."

174348854,"So I had two really good days where the voices were not as loud and I felt more me than I have in a while. This morning (my monday) I was talking to my mom and I was telling her how it’s been easier for me to be in “control” of my schizophrenia and she asked me if I thought I was finding a cure. I told her kinda, mostly because it’s not really explainable but afterwards she told me “Good, I’m glad you’re not thinking about it as much.” Which… stumped me and left me a bit baffled and emotional. I cant explain how much that made me want to cry. There is not a second that goes by where I’m not thinking about it or simply thinking back to it. I wanted to explain that but realized it wouldn’t be helpful. It’s pretty messed up to think about the fact that people even those of us with schizophrenia will never understand each other or our internal struggles. We can share, compare and help cope but at the end of the day, this is our own battle. Most people only notice something’s o
ff when you are first diagnosed and going through the heavier part of this disease. As we learn to cope the issue becomes less apparent and even though it’s nice to be functioning, others will never know the struggle of actually being able to piece and hold yourself together."

176027796,I was put on propranolol 80mgs twice daily for anxiety and high blood pressure
176027797,"At this point I’m thinking about my future and juggling the facts that with the way my health is I figure even though my life expectancy is 62 which gives me four years to live, I think that these following four years will be my last good years. I mean these following four years is probably the last years I will have energy and both good physical and mental health. So the decision that I need to ponder is this: Do I work for the next four years? Or would it be better to leave my job and enjoy my last good years? My job is great in many ways; I like my co-workers, I like my bosses, I love the company that employs me, and the work ain’t tough. I have extra benefits that I have never received at any other job. The city I work in just raised their minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. I get paid vacation, paid sick leave, they gave us some debit/ credit card to use at precipitating clinics, hospitals, drug stores to pay the cost of medication and other health related costs. So my local pharmacy accepts M
edicare but I still get charged nominal fees for the past two years but I present this card and get my meds for free. And I don’t know if this company is crazy or something but they have this benefit that they add their own money too every month which is basically a program that if I get fired or quit, they will give me this growing fund which now stands at $7000. That’s a lot of rent and food money. It gets bigger all the time and when I leave this job it’s all mine. But the reality is that I don’t like the idea of spending my last 4 good years working at a job that is not glorious or high status and then I die. I am seriously considering quitting and doing something else with my life besides toiling at a job with no chance of promotion. And then after 4 years I retire and I probably will start declining physically. My own personal trend seems to be that my mental health will get better in some ways and worse in other ways as I age. So that’s the dilemma. I’m going to talk it over with my sisters
. I’m self sufficient and not a burden but they still help me in many ways. The question is: can I survive on SSDI alone without working?"

I ended up getting someone suspended, and I have absolutely no way of making it right. This person is God knows where, possibly in the hospital, possibly dead, possibly just fúcking fine. I have no way of knowing, and there’s nothing to be done, so I just have to live with it. I tried; I mean, I was doing well, but then it hit me like a ton of bricks that this person may never trust anyone again. They could just let go and die and it would be 100% my fault.

Over those 9 years mood wise I’ve been quite stable , ie just mild depression rearing its head occasionally . When asked at my last appointment about mood symptoms I responded to how I’d been in the last 9 years ie very little mood symptoms . Historically though I’ve previously been dxed with sz-a mixed type . This is what I posted to someone about my mood symptoms in 2006 . Most probably mixed- Predominantly dysphoric. Anxiety,irritability,inner tension,busy mind,edgy,depression,contentious,impatient, Could I recall that at the appointment ? - no . I couldn’t see beyond the (at the time) 9 years of mood stability since 2009 . Such things might , I believe, distort whether mood symptoms are seen as a part of one’s mental illness or not ."

His meds have been adjusted as of 10 days ago. He’s been using his magnifying glass and collecting hair, fuzz, tiny scraps of paper, etc…that he says are worms. They live in the carpet and burrow into his body at his fingertips and toes. He’s also very paranoid about anything that he perceives as shiny. This includes any metal, semi precious stones, sunlight, smooth surfaces. He gets himself into such a state that he will not sleep—this makes all of his hallucinations even worse, if you can imagine. Watching this is breaking my heart. Do you have any words for how I may help him? Has anyone else dealt with anything that I’ve described? Help me!

174348890,You can learn coping skills to deal with negative symptoms so it won’t affect your day to day living. Almost all chronic diseases is like this for example medicines for diabetics won’t cure the disease but it helps to live with diabetics. For negative symptoms there is no effective medicine like for positive symptoms. In fact medicines for positive symptoms even worsens negative symptoms. Only thing that works is therapy and in that you can learn various coping skills to deal with it. Creating good daily habits and following them strictly whether feel like it to do or not is one of the best technique to live with it.

174348897,"I took adderall once when I was in the hospital at my worst, completely paranoid. The doctor ruined my chances. It was a one time deal. It’s so hard to get adderall as a schizophrenic, especially without a diagnosis of ADD. Even getting a diagnosis of ADD without getting diagnosed as a child is a pain in the butt. I ended up totally paranoid and psychotic after she gave me 10 mg of adderall or whatever. It was one pill. I could get it if I go through with my ADD diagnosis, but it’s not worth it because I cannot quit the energy drinks for a week. Plus, adderall is something I am learning to not want anymore. It’s over rated and can cause new symptoms of psychosis. Anyways, I now take Strattera for ADD. It is a non-stimulant and works completely different. It works on norepinephrene not dopamine. It’s doing amazing for me, but I feel like it’s sort of weak. I’m on 40 mg and I want to increase it when I see my doctor again. Perhaps to 80 mg. I feel safer and no addiction issues or anything

176027920,"Hello, I’m not a master of english but I’ll try to describe this weirdness that comes to me sometimes. First, it happened more when I was young. I can’t tell when it starts. It’s an uncomfortable feeling that I become aware of. From there it’s a 20min tension that’s slowly increasing in intensity. Thoughts race through my life and I become aware of muscles that are working at that moment. Even just my jaws keeping my mouth closed gives a multiplied feeling of me biting harder than I really am. Holding my fist closed feels like I’m applying a death grip. Time seems faster. This continues to, I would say, a 7/10 intensity at which point it subsides fast, like 10 minutes to completely go away. There’s no pain, just mildly, moderately unpleasant. Just needs waiting out. Anyone can relate? I’ve never encountered any term that properly describes this."

I have to be told/shown how to do things many times before I remember how to do it myself. That annoys and frustrates my coworkers and supervisors. I’ve been fired a few times for not catching on quickly enough. I’m experienced in my current jobs, so that’s not a concern atm. The biggest difficulty I have currently is with poor motivation, not to mention anxiety, depression and just all-around feeling crummy mentally; sometimes I call off from work for those reasons. Also, I tend to move slowly. I’ve found I can’t keep up with fast-paced jobs, such as inpatient pharmacy tech or factory worker. It’s hard to say how much of this is schizoaffective disorder and how much is medication side effects."

176028070,I think volunteering is great if your on disability. It’s hard because we are all difference and for someone like me stress is my biggest issue…If I work long hours I start to get paranoid and that goes south eventually. I’m on disability and volunteering is really good for me because it forces me to get out of the house. It forces me to be present and in control to turn up at certain times and do certain chores. If you can work smaller hours with little stress I’d recommend that because money is always nice…if you can get on disability then volunteering can make you feel a lot more involved with work that you otherwise aren’t doing…if that makes sense.

176028079,"Aliens of the Secret Particle Society ""The interesting thing about existing is the never ending amount of questions that have been asked throughout the ages, how we came to be and the other wonders many have had. One question that many speculate about is the hidden particle somewhere by the graviton particles and dark matter. The interesting thing about this particle is that it’s hidden from the worlds scientists, and yet, considered very valuable to a certain race of aliens. These unknown beings roam the universe searching for this rare particle to harvest… "" _NAME_ relaxed his arms and stared at the blinking cursor on the glaring computer screen. He started to think of ways to continue his story that he would publish on his blog. It was a small blog that he kept about the ideas of extraterrestrials and UFOS. _NAME_ was utterly obsessed with the idea of aliens and UFOs so that most of his time was spent reading controversial news articles to find hidden patterns. Recently he had found someth
ing that had intrigued him after walking his dog in the park. No one would believe what he had saw that night. _NAME_ pulled up the old blog post that was more about his experience from that night. ""Hello! Paranormal Task Force readers, today I have an interesting story to tell about my recent encounter with extraterrestrials. It happened just yesterday, actually, I had an encounter with extraterrestrials from another world! I thought they had categorized all the aliens that exist, but today I have met some interesting extraterrestrial beings that live among us humans. It happened just an hour ago while I was walking my dog. A tic-tac shaped object had descended from the sky and shown a bright blue light on me and I blacked out. When I regained consciousness I was in a weird metallic room with all these weird gizmos and lights blinking. That’s when the door behind me opened with a whoosh sound and there stood this weird figure. It had three eyes, a slim body and a large oval head. It made a couple clicking 
sounds before a light shown on its body and, what i could guess, a hologram played over it and the being was now a man."" “Hello, _NAME_” the man said “I have been reading and watching your blog for a few years now, we are very interested in your research you have been doing on what you call “extraterrestrials”” “Whoa…” _NAME_ stood stunned and shocked “I come from a planet a few thousand light years away, don’t worry I am what your species call an “anthropologist”, which means I study other cultures of the Universe for the Particle Society” “Wha… who…?” _NAME_ continued to wonder what was going on. “I have made contact with you to share research with you, you have helped me alot to figure out what humans think of extraterrestrial life, so I will repay the favor. You see, _NAME_, that there is a secret particle your species has yet to discover. There is some theory about it, but nothing concrete has been said about it. So i’ll share the information with you. It’s a pa
rticle that is trillion times smaller then an atom and it’s very precious, many space companies are after this particle and it’s very abundant in your solar system. Though the Federation only borrows the particles from your solar system from time to time, we have tried to keep your solar system safe from space bandits that would steal these particles your species has yet to discover.” “…” _NAME_ felt the room spinning “_NAME_?” The man reached out. _NAME_ awoke to his dog licking his face. “Whoa… what just happened?” _NAME_ layed on the ground for a few moments before getting up and brushing himself off. _NAME_ got home and unlocked his laptop to tell his story about his vision. Was it real? [[First time writing in awhile, what you think? I feel like i didnt connect the story within a story very well. It’s also kinda rushed. I’m writing a couple more aswell, mostly for some practice.]]"
174348942,"Hey man I’ve been through years of schooling with schizophrenia. I’m doing my bachelor’s degree in engineering at rigorous university. If you have any questions or just want to talk, don’t hesitate to contact me. There are a few things that have helped me a lot with schooling while having schizophrenia. The first thing I would suggest is talk to the disability office at your school. They can give you accommodations for school that will help you a lot. Examples of accommodations include extra time for exams, note takers and certain technology. Sometimes schools will have counselors that can help you overcome symptoms that interfere with school. Try to see if your school has one of these counselors. They can be really helpful. After that I’d suggest you talk to your therapist. Go to your therapist and tell them the symptoms you are having and ask for help. The therapist can provide tools and techniques to overcome your symptoms and to do well in school. Other things that help me with school 
is exercise. There are a lot of studies that show cardiovascular exercise helps with mental health. I find my mind is the sharpest after I go for a good run. I’d suggest exercising daily if you can, preferably cardio . Just 20-30 minutes a day is sufficient. You want to do it earlier in the day so the effects last into the day. Another thing is to do the work and go to class. Don’t miss lecture. Do every assignment. Of course if you’re not feeling well or something comes up it’s it’s OK to miss stuff. Don’t get too stressed out. However do your best to go to class and to do your work. I also highly recommend going to office hours regularly. Not only will that give you a better grasp on the material, it will save you a lot of time when doing homework. A huge suggestion I have is to ask for help. This means both for school and mental health. If you’re having trouble with an assignment or concept, ask the professor, ask a friend, go to office hours, or whatever. If you’re having a symptom, ask yo
ur therapist for help. If you have friends you can study with, that will help too. I find my symptoms are less when I’m around other people and not isolating. It can help to be around friends even if you’re not working on the same material. It will help your focus if you’re around other people. It’s also good for you in general to be around others. Also if you’re more comfortable with just paying attention in class and not taking notes, I’d suggest getting a note taker. I personally find it easier to just listen in class and not take notes but it might be different for you. Another thing that many people have reported is that headphones can dampen the voices. This can be useful while studying. However I have to warn you if you have headphones on you can isolate. Which might be counterproductive to focusing. I noticed when I’m listening to music I am not interacting with people. When I’m interacting with people or just listening to the social environment around me my focus is a lot better and m
y mind is a lot calmer. Another thing that helped me immensely was getting on a ketogenic diet. This helped me a lot with my focus and my schizophrenia symptoms. It might be worth looking into. The subreddit on Reddit for keto it is a good starting place. _PERSON_ helped immensely with school. It boosted my energy levels immensely. It’s got rid of my anxiety. And reduced schizophrenia symptoms immensely. Another thing I suggest is to just keep moving forward even if stuff is bothering you. I had a wide array of symptoms when going through school. I had everything from delusions thinking I was Jesus Christ in the world is going to end, voices. involuntary body movements and severe anxiety. The one thing that helped me was just to keep moving forward – go to class, do the work, and don’t give up . At the same time it’s important to know when something isn’t working. At that time it’s good to ask for help and change your strategy for the particular challenge."

176028083,Keep fighting for every single thing about function. Loss of motivation is common but look for methods to improve. Often depression is common with sz. Getting on appropriate anti depressants can make a difference. Also. Adding exercise can make real gains. It’s hard to get going but once your on a path of walking 30 minutes a day briskly it does get easier. I bought a fitness tracker and started small with some realistic goals. I’m not saying it’s easy but I’ve been in your shoes. All’s I can say is fight. I get bored and refuse to let anything beat me…that helps.

174348949,"Currently, I think I was a little German boy with _PERSON_ during Nazi Germany as a victim, then I was _NAME_, and then me (this guy typing). Those 2 are the past lives I figured out. I had a dream or alien visitation in a past life telling me I was a German professor or something in a past life. I don’t know if real or just trying to confuse me with disinfo. I’ve been lied to a lot. I think me (this guy typing) suffered the most because he was involved or invented time travel in a past life. The time lines don’t make any sense, they contradict themselves. _NAME_ was born in 1914 and died in 1952. The little kid you see in the picture was probably 10-12 years old (just a guess) in 1940. How can you be 2 different people at once? Maybe this is my original life or body and then I was experimented on and traumatized… So, I’m guessing it’s a different world or something or maybe soul/consciousness transfer into a new or different body – a new high technology that doesn’t really exist or 
known about. If you google ‘vampire time travelers’ on youtube, you see that a lot of celebrities are clones and have this ability. So essentially, you can be anybody, I guess. But, for me, I’ve been (this guy typing) for billions of times in a time loop in the same body, living the same life, as a paranoid schizophrenia that is extremely disabled and suffering. We live in a computer simulation or what’s called a computer program. I was tortured by Nazis in my past probably due/because of Reptilian aliens. Sometimes, I think I was Jewish or something. I don’t know. I suffered a lot. Anyways, that’s the content of my psychosis right now."

If I handed this report to my college tutor I would have failed as there is no argument apart from this made to link the information together: Rating Scales: You completed the RAADS-R (Rivto Autism Asperger’s Diagnostic Scale) assessment. This is an 80 question rating scale which looks at language, social relatedness, sensory/motor features and circumscribed interests. You scored 187/240 on the scale.

Sure, he annoyed me sometimes, but he acted as the father that I should’ve had. He wasn’t supposed to die this soon. We were supposed to watch all of Supernatural together. We were all supposed to move to the country. He was supposed to teach me to drive. He was always supposed to be there. He was never supposed to die. And my mom’s being a grade A bi tch. She’s been using me as a punching bag this entire time. She believes that her grief is worse than mine because she knew him for 47 years. She told me as much. It’s her father, so her grief matters more. She’s being an ass hole. Oh, and I’m just supposed to accept th
is assholery because it’s part of the grieving process. She just yelled at us for no good reason, then called us back to apologize. Then, when my brother left, she got mad that I was mad about being treated like trash and passive aggressively said “goodnight, circle” as she told me to leave. She just wants to be left alone right now. And I’m somehow inconsiderate because she’s sleepy. Like bi tch, you’re the one who wanted to watch 8 episodes of The Good Place in a row, nonstop. So fu ck her. She can run to her friends and cry to them and go out with them as I just sit here and cry to myself, because I’m allowed to cry, just not too hard or else she’ll yell at me to “stop the histrionics” and threaten to take me to the hospital.

I can’t rule out aliens, but I have memories of several uncountable alien abductions and MiB and camo/milabs type things happening in other lives. I have memories and flashbacks and dreams of grey aliens and ufos and time travel and portals and me being cloned and having my soul extracted from my body and put into a new clone and then sent back in time. I don’t know what could be worse, but I woke up from it. I kind of remember being kidnapped but don’t know if it was real. I hit my head and blacked out and felt like I was severely tortured like mk-ultra monarch programming that a montauk boy would go through. I almost died. I did die before but came back alive…many times. Sort of like ground hog day, my life is on repeat since all

176028159,Yes very same just recently I was pushing myself a couple of weeks to walk an hour every day except Sunday and I was feeling very depressed and irritable I was also doing three Pilates session a week It was too much and I’ve cut it all down exercise wise and I feel a lot better I am calmer and my mood is better I think too much exercise makes you worse

176028169,I hope you are ok.
176028170,"Alot really. I cant really say one lesson is more important than another tbh though. Even now, me being off meds and feeling better than ever… It taught me to never take my mind for granted. I’m cautious with everything I do at this point from stress levels, to physical consumption of what ever. If you look back in my post I use to want to do nothing but smoke and skate again. I’m still down with the skating, especially since I’m back on the side of the states where most skateparks are free, but ask for the weed aspect… been there done that, got sick, got better, smoked again for a while after I got better, and now I’m done with it… for now at least. Thing about sz really is, it’s just a label in society that only makes you stand out from other human beings who most likely have specific labels that describes them and makes them stand out as well… I mean really everybody got some sort of label in a sence rather it be fat, arrogant, introverted, etc… i call it labels cause for som
e people it’s problems while for some other folks it’s just part of there life problably and dont even think about it, still function, get by, all that jazz. People dont even be pre judging like that unless they’re just trying to stand out for whatever reason which could be justifiable or not idk depends but flat out, people generally just keep their opinion to themselves… at least from my experience in life so far. It’s a funny thing about labels for me cause looking back at my records some time ago I’m actually sz on paper??? but I’ve been off meds for months and haven’t had any symptoms come back… and I went cold turkey in a sence cause I didnt ween myself off like how they recommend. I mean really from seeing so many different faces on here from that post a selfie topic, it just shows me all walks of life be dealing with what ever life has thrown at them rather being physical, mental, and or both. I guess in other words we got to give everything and everyone some sort of title and or tit
les. I even had somebody on here question my whole reason on being on here labeling me a pdoc??? but nope… just an average _NAME_ looking for like minds. Isn’t that why were all here and on social media in general anyway? But idk some people might call this whoplah but I’m just speaking from what I’ve learned through these past 4 years of technically being sz. I just know at the end of the day, I’m a fortunate mf for where I’m at now compared to where I’ve came from. Much love and peace folks… I dont think peace signs and heart symbols show up on here?"

176028173,This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
176028174,I notice things… but i think its more than weed/vaccine/prozac combined. I mean I had an episode. I dont often have episodes. I used to not have them/was more blocked and apathetic.

176028175,Yep. I go the 30th for my injection. Always a nice reminder I depend on meds.

176028179,"I think that when i will stay better, i will go to Itaca Project, it’s a place where People with mental Illness can learn and find a Job, i think that I will see a therapist too, since i’ve had a lot of traumas in my life and my family doesn’t help so much. They are antipsichiatryst, and this is so bad for me, they think that you don’t need unless you are in a acute phase, but they don’t know that if you don’t take meds, you go in a acute phase. It’s all so hard, talk with them is so hard, but I think that I have to be strong, It doesn’t Matter that I have this disease, It matters that it’s under control, so i can live a better life. I think that everything will be better for me from now, i really think that. Hope mustn’t die, we have to be strong and work hard to Exit from the worst situations. This is what i wanted to Say, hello to everyone."
176028180,If you spent half the time questioning things and just accept you have something (maybe agree with your doctors) you could achieve so much. Maybe focus that energy and get a college degree or phd in math.
176028181,"All these delusions can be true but I don’t care anymore. I just sit back and smoke cigs and walk and do w.e. It’s fun to think. And I don’t think anything is crazy about me past delusions of reference Leading to grandiosity. I don’t believe movies are made to parallel another dimension. But I believe everything has infinite purposes. Maybe the matrix was designed to entertain people, confuse me, as well as lead one down another path. Maybe my path intertwines with every other path ever made. You can say the butterfly effect. But that means in order for it to be the way it is, everything had to go exactly as it has. I think you’re getting what I’m leading to in this thinking. But either coincidences happen because of the complexity of the universe. And they’re inevitable. Either that or the controllers of it all or god will you say has orchestrated everything perfectly. I dunno the reason. But sometimes I think. I don’t know what I think. Maybe psychosis make you SEE such coincidenc

176028184,"That’s fantastic! I am excited that _PERSON_ is working for you. _PERSON_ is completely safe when only the root of the Noble variety is used. The problem is that all the extracts you can buy in the store and online are likely to be poor quality and potentially dangerous. I don’t use kava anymore. I use Valerian occasionally, and it really helps. I no longer use Ativan. Hopefully you can find a way to manage the feeling you are describing–I think I know exactly what you are talking about. Do you think that raising the dose of your antipsychotic will help or is it already too high for you? That personally helped me with catatonia A LOT, but some people actually report a worsening of catatonia when the antipsychotic dose is raised."

176028200,death after life ? then
174348970,I think the one I posted about is being developed.
176028201,"I think your concept of hell comes from an ‘christian’ ideology where hell exists in a plane all of its own. A place where hell exists for its own sake and all in it is evil. What I am trying to convey is that while some live in heaven on earth, others live either as demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and in the hell realm all here on earth! I do not believe that there is no goodness or that a life can be transformed from one realm to another while existing on this planet, but that while one person may be in heaven another lives as if in hell. I contend most szs live in the hell realm. Just take a look at this site for evidence of that and these are the ones capable of going online. Most humans live in a deluded sense of self and reflect it on others. Perhaps, it is I who is deluded or perhaps I see the grim reality only of the hell realm, who knows? This is Samsara and all hells and heavens reside in it."
176028202,Being broadcasted over tv makes me an influence. It’s hard to believe that for the past 3 years all of this attention was on me and still on me. What’s so special about me?
176028203,"I have checked my ears with a doctor recently and found that it does not have infections and no hearing problems. But i constantly feel like i have a sharp pain which is mild and jarring, not letting me concentrate even on my thoughts. Its really annoying and makes me feel like most of the problem that i face is due to that. Not sure if it is psychological or physical? What test would help identify?"
174348971,"Well, I haven’t tried the tea in years. I drank it once when I was completely dead numb from meds, and it had no effect because I was emotionless at the time. Well I just checked the back of my cupboard and found mulberry leaf tea there. I’ve made a tea and I can say I enjoy it. In mouse models mulberry leaf showed antipsychotic potential. Please ask your doctor before taking it because it may interact with medication. I have no worries with it. I wonder if it’s a true antipsychotic, it’s calming and is known to increase gaba waves and promote tranquility and zen vibes, from what I’ve read. This tea pairs well with holy basil (tulsi), in which it depletes stress in me. I like. I wish they do more studies on mulberry leaf for schizophrenia, seeing how well it performed in mouse models. Then again it probably doesn’t touch schizophrenia, but then again it might stop it. Time will tell hopefully lol. The tea is sweet and slightly tart."
176028204,I’m not recording this one.
176028205,probably. i dont know if it exactly qualifies. all my times with therapists and counselors ive never brought it up. still have alot of violent dreams towards the person but i feel ive let it go and am glad i can choose to never have to see them again.

I haven been on them for 8 years,minus 3 times of two year where I got off meds.I still couldn’t convince myself to stay on them because I didn’t really see any benefit beside making me more tired.Not against people taking them because I never knew what happen to them before they took meds,but I think I’ll do better off them"

176028216,Go to your regular doctor and get some bloodwork done. It could be a lot of things and getting control of your health with things like cholesterol control is probably a good thing. There’s issues with antipsychotic pills but there’s other things to do with health you need to address. More exercise and eating well really do help. Go to your doctor and form a plan.

176028281,"The problem is I live in Eastern Europe and doctors and nurses are safe from any responsibility, once you sign anything and whatever happens to you, it is not their fault. It is a huge social _USER_ID_ to have a mental illness like this in Eastern Europe, it is similar to china: you wont get employed if you say you have it and doctors and nurses treat you like piece of trash and if you try to complain you probably will get called out to be delusional and get a dose of diazepam or haldol."

Their core values were religious ones,” help the poor, etc…” but management was all about quotas and pressuring people to meet targets; some weeks I only worked 14 hours. I was a full time employee. The ceo made and extra 9 million dollars in one year. The doctors gave themselves a $30,000 bonus for one year. You were told even though your hours are based on targets and quotas to come up with more ways to save money. Helping the poor was second, if a patient had Medicaid the doctor would see them last and give them poor care compared to those with insurance."

176028332,"I kinda think younger people should get vaccinated earlier or at the same time as elderly folks, especially younger folks with disabilities. They have much more life ahead of them.

176028337,This is a live feed my bad. Just about to kick off again! Cricket is a game of sessions…You bat. You bowl. It’s like baseball. It’s not intellectual it’s about process and thought to achieve a goal. It is a thinking sport. Setting fields and such is a lot of work and intuitive and it’s not easy. I was a lower grade captain at our club for years. You learn a lot about moving people and it’s probably more like chess. You need people behind the wicket and whether they are catching to get a wicket…or saving a run because those runs add up. Great sport.

176028356,I think they both aim to create some space between the memory or perception and our responses to them. But the way you practice each is very different I think. Incorporating cbt into day to day thinking is in my experience pretty damn argues. The diligence it requires is exhausting. Whereas emdr is a session thing. Don’t get me wrong done right emdr is exhausting too but you don’t have to develop a habit. Which I suck at.

176028361,"I don’t remember specifically whether the _NAME_-analyses I’ve seen included alcohol or what degree of use they looked at. But alcohol abuse and intoxication is strongly related to violence, and the highest increased risk of violence is associated with using multiple drugs at the same time."

176028369,The real audience is you reflected in your voices and I imagine your voices represent people who harshly judged you before. At least that’s my guess as I don’t know what causes this crap any more than anyone else. I’ll just tell you that I’ve been there and it takes years to improve (but it is likely to do so).
176028370,"Are you in therapy? I’ve found that medications only go so far with severe delusions and talking with a therapist really helps keep you grounded. And, of course, you should stay away from websites that trigger you. Its hard for me to stay on track too, That’s something that therapy has really helped. Maybe you can find one and practice some CBT or something."

176028373,Taking advantage of emotionally vulnerable people (like us) is the hallmark of a lowly character. You are 100% entitled to start caring less about them and more about yourself!
176028374,"After almost 20 years I am stable, but not recovered. My old meds stopped working a few years ago and I became psychotic. Switched to new meds and am stable again.

176028377,"I also notice that my one next door neighbor doesn’t wave hi to me anymore. He’s become less social with my father too but mainly with me. These people are sensing that I have a disability and this makes them uncomfortable. I’m being less friendly towards my neighbors. It’s unfortunate because they were very friendly towards us in the past. Oh well, I’ll say hi to them if they wave hi first."

176028386,I had ice cream before I went to bed last night…bad bad…haha…but I weighed at the doctor’s yesterday and I am down to 205! just six more pounds and I will be under 200 !!
176028387,"I’m definitely talking about something stronger than caffeine, but I do keep drinking/taking more and more of that because it’s legal. I need help with: •motivation •lack of energy •accepting that I’m not super-human •abiding by the constraints of natural awake time in each day I’m past the immediate withdrawal stage (well, I’m not completely clean yet, but am on about 1/10th what I was flying high on before and was hospitalized for that coming down experience for a month)."
176028388,I’m on 6mg risperidone and I was voice free for 8 months. I recently started hearing whispers but they are manageable. I’m thinking of upping my dose of risperidone if they get any worse. So I’d be on 8mg. The thing is I’m not sure if my doctor will up it to 8mg I’d say he will want to change meds instead.
176028389,I feel inner peace when I am in right standing with God.
176028390,"Not yet. Been totally disabled for 8 years so far. I tried to a few times but to no avail. I am highly skeptical of people who claim to be recovered and I think either they are super, super lucky or were misdiagnosed from get-go and or are liars."
176028391,maybe your meds need to be adjusted again? Did you say this to your pdoc too?
176028392,"movies used to be all i enjoyed, but i don’t enjoy them like i do gaming for several years. Guess I’ve always been more into gaming. No and then I can get into a movie."
176028393,"Honestly I don’t think you’d need pain relief for there, but it depends on your pain threshold"
174349018,"IDK. I’ve just driven since I was 17 with some long gaps in between. I drive in areas notorious for bad traffic. But I manage it and I’ve had about 8 accidents but only 2 were my fault and no one got hurt. Hell, I used to blast down the freeway at 75 mph with the radio at full volume, with a crack pipe in my mouth, smoking crack. I wouldn’t reccomend it but I never got in an accident but now I’m much more conservative (and smarter). I don’t hallucinate and I enjoy driving."
176028394,I really like your idea of delivering meals on wheels. It doesn’t involve a lot of interaction but it is such a feel good kind of job. My niece used to work every summer for the city watering and mowing and painting picnic tables etc. She got paid quite well.
176028395,You could try iherb.com
176028396,"I couldnt think of anything worse tbh ! I highly doubt any of it was a placebo. they were taking 13 microns !

Anyways, you can count me out !"
174349019,im pretty sure akathisia is not from negative symptoms. its a side effect of medication.
176028397,"i’m an auxiliary nurse so yes, kind of. i work in a hospital and i want to be a nurse, but lately all this has kind of hiccuped my plans"
176028398,"Yeah, my intrusive thoughts are about certain people and the thought acts like it is that person hanging around to troll me. The more I enjoy what I’m doing in spite of the presence the weaker they get, because it’s invalidating their power. I’m not going to put my life on hold because it’s there.

176028400,"Mine started as hallucinations of people/ghosts when I was…15. (I thought 17 in previous posts but it’s actually 15) It started as just mood problems, anxiety, and very rare hallucinations. Then the illness evolved into paranoia about ghosts watching me, haunting me, and following me. I started seeing pictures move and watch me. I thought people were watching me through the windows. Then it evolved further when I was 19, into delusions of persecution, that everyone was out to destroy me and molest me. My point is – mine started out like yours…I think. But it kept evolving and still is throwing new stuff my way."

176028441,"For some reason I have a sharp and immediate downturned response to words that’d usually have a positive connotation like “yay” and to other expressions of happiness like singing happy songs or smiling. Sometimes it’s just unexplainable sadness, other times the sadness is redirected into anger which I think may be a defense/coping mechanism. The moodswing could give me whiplash it’s so strong. I’d never attack someone, but I’ve turned the anger inward, hitting myself, beating my fists against concrete, or yelling in frustration, beyond the ability to contain myself. The anger has to exist or I’d crumple onto the ground in tears. Feelings of guilt evoke the same, but even more strongly. The person I live with regularly apologizes for things that aren’t her fault or don’t matter like using the microwave while I’m getting ready to use it. I explained to her that I have reactions like this to her apologies because they make me feel guilty, and she apologized for being the cause. T
he reaction is so sudden and painful that she would do less damage punching me instead. If I were beyond all sanity then I’d say she was trying to make me feel sad and guilty by apologizing for everything. The point is I’d like to fix feeling this way towards guilt and expressions of others’ happiness, because it’s personally damaging and causes me constant grief. It would be nice to hear if anyone else has similar problems."

176028446,Many doctors and therapists have diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder. A few with bipolar disorder. My current psychiatrist honestly is stumped when finding the correct diagnosis for me. For insurance purposes she diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder but honestly I’m doing better off mood stabilizers like Depakote. I’m doubting whether I’m schizophrenic or bipolar. All I know is that when I’m on certain activating meds or when I’m off of Risperdal I become psychotic. Mainly delusional and paranoid with zero insight. My psychiatrist is certain that I suffer with OCD and anxiety. Everything else is in the dark.

The best way I can describe it is by referring to the movie Avatar, specifically the scene in which the protagonist is walking through a jungle at night for the first time and touching all the plants, which light up with pretty colors—very vivid, colorful, and not linear. There was the sensation of being on a sort of roller coaster, riding through different scenes. At one point, it felt as though my chair was on a cloud. Then suddenly, the chair disappeared and I was floating on the cloud. It was a wonderful experience. Man this must be some good stuff.

It was the type of “sentinel event” that can cause serious legal probs for a hospital…ever since then she’s done everything in her power to not let me on her unit. I think it’s a form of disability discrimination but who’s going to buy my story over hers?
176028533,It’s ok to have different beliefs and political views and still love each other. The best man I know is right winged. He is extremely right winged n wants free gun laws etc I voted greens last year and he hates the greens. Next time I will vote animal justice party and maybe a bit of sco mo but mainly animal justice party. So my favourite man I know of has opposite political views to me but we still love each other. I think I love everyone even those I don’t like. I have similar beliefs as hyperianism but I can’t give up my belief in unconditional love. Why force myself to hate when I don’t? I can have friends with different political views I think. My favourite man I know of is my x in SA. I left him to become vegan and give my horse a better home. It was pretty perfect with him in so many ways but he hates vegans. I am animal rights activist wanna be and I could not stand that he killed mice with glue traps. I left him for the animals. Maybe that equals politics in a way. Stand your ground
. My dad thinks I should not be allowed to vote because only uneducated stupid people vote greens he said. My dad would vote for _NAME_ if he didn’t vote liberal .he really loves her and she is concidered racist. It’s ok to love someone with different beliefs you might not like their behaviour though such as I didn’t like glue traps etc

Maybe getting out of the house and taking a nice walk around the neighborhood would take your mind off your problems.

I also attend very many support groups, see friends, go on the internet a lot, will be attending day treatment once per week for transition care.

176028571,"No matter how simple my to-do lists become, they stress me out. I agree that, in general, they aren’t bad for mental health. But they are bad for my mental health. I do hope to eventually get to a point where I can make and follow them again. I like lists and organization, but right now, it isn’t what’s best for me. _AT_MENTION_ I like “ta da” list. Cute!"

176028573,That bugs me too sometimes. When i moved from Europe to Australia on my own. I hear suddenly familiar voices from my teenage years out of the neighborhood. When i checked it out there was no party going on at all. It was in my mind. Just recently I realized they are voices from deceased people as well. Maybe its just stress and a copingmechanism to deal with present problems which are to traumatic to deal with at this moment . Something i can deal with it later. I feel so much better as i have no stress to explain myself most of the times. Just the penetrating arthritis and some sore nerves. The pain and agony starts. It will be a salvation for me when i pass this life to the next.
176028574,"Yes, I would be absolutely engrossed in this awe inspiring spectacle. lol"
176028575,It’s so sad what has happened. You would have thought we learned from the Malaysia flight that got shot down over Ukraine

Vraylar not approved in Belgium (1 year delay) because of the insurrance not covering Vraylar, so bad my pdoc was ready to prescribe it. very bad! i guess im living on monkey land Is Sertindole (Serdolect) an option? only seroquel and minocycline took my depression away for a few months but thats it the rest isnt working, and then you have that Lyme and co infection thing going on… Do I have it Yes or NO? not good testing wtf is this?"
176028578,Can’t sleep again been going in and out of psychosis
174349062,Maybe mescaline caused the grandeur. Maybe I’m bipolar. And lsd caused the paranoia. And the bipolar caused the grandeur. I dunno my bad trip was that everyone was out to get to me. So it caught a similar theme in my life going forward. But truly I may be bi polar with poly substance abuse. My pdoc said yearssss ago I was bipolar and drugs made me sza. But I was probably ptsd too before if that’s all true with psychotic components to both. But I didn’t think he knew what he was saying. I heard voices before I ever did any drug or alcohol. Sooo In the end we all know it doesn’t really matter. We’ve all made mistakes. We all have issues. We also all wanna be the best we can be. And the chemistry of the brain meeting the environment and substances and meds added too is so complicated and difficult to forecast what’s right for one and what’s the diagnosis for another. Imo. Hopefully one day we figure this all out. For now it’s baby steps

I noticed a real breakthrough when I started being civil with them and not reacting in anger. Take the wind out of their sails by ignoring them (distractions) or being kind to them even when they are horrible. You seem like a nice person, do not compromise yourself by turning bitter!

176028585,The following content is an episode from my early childhood which was written in my diary…But sadly i don’t recall it but it was written in my Personal Diary …thought of sharing it it all started when i was in class 8 in school we had a trekking adventure from sukhiapokhri to sandakphu …as we started the journey from sukhiapokhri …every day we have to hike for at least 7-8 km…i am not gonna explain the whole journey but before our last stop i was too tired was thinking i am not gonna make it as i was fool cause every one has used one rucksack bag with them but i carried two & i was tired to my ass but before our last hike something happened as we had a break i mean the last from our destination but i was curious to finish to see the end of the trek so i left alone just to see whats will be path of our next trip but after crossing road i saw the most beautiful scene which i have saw in my entire life i literally can’t explain it in words like its was the bed of clouds overlooking the mo
untains witnessing the _USER_ID_ it was a divine…the place was very very foggy like if you are standing beside me i cant be able to see you …when suddenly i heard a voice & i followed the voice …suddenly in darkness not fully dark evening like dark as it was mountain their no telling when it will dark & when it will be bright…i saw a very very bright light…& saw a figure so so so beautiful & she was praying & singing & i became so enchanted & started to fall asleep…when i woke up i was in a hut & an old lady was beside me said she found me in the woods unconscious & i told the whole story & she was shocked & was smiling then she told me a story that i never told anyone except you & she said once their a girl & a boy in there village who were deeply in love & wanted to get married but the day before there marriage he was called out for war from like era of WWII & as he was gone she prayed everyday for his return safely & would sing But he never came back & they said that she turned into stone statu
e while waiting for him…& it is said that only a person with pure heart will be able to see & hear her…as i was late enough i was thinking everybody would be worried so i hurried & ran to base & saw no one was worried as i was only 5-10 mins late for the evening counting but when i was there it seems like hours …i know how will you believe this as i also have trouble believing… Maybe it’s an escape from reality or maybe its actually happened …really don’t know but i liked this story very much so i shared…maybe i am still delusional(haha)

176028595,"With quantum entangled particles, which have been assumed theoretically to allow information to travel faster than the speed of light, it seems for some reason that it’s impossible to actually make the information do that. At least that’s what I read some years ago. The speed of light could be more than just the speed at which light travels, it could be the basic clock at which the universe operates, or something like that. So potentially, any transference of information across space is limited to the speed of light, even when you travel in time. Sort of like the tick speed in video games."

174349071,"I like to think about schizophrenia as becoming a shaman. I must learn the stories from the other side and record them. That’s why I write, but I can’t neglect my own needs as a person while doing so because it will effect the quality of my work. I set times aside for my visions, where I concentrate on the ideas I hear, usually right before bed. It becomes the dreams I have at night. In the morning I focus on my daily activities that are non-shaman related. It was about finding balance for me. It’s kind of outside the scope of what most people talk about because many have negative visions and want them to go away. I actually like mine, they help me understand my world.

174349070,I did. I think it was the investigation of my top secret security clearance and my wife’s alcoholism that put me over the rails. It was too much to handle all at once.

One night a knife was thrown across the kitchen. But when I started taking risperidone the voices were hardly every there. And the weird stuff that happened went away. The thing that has helped me the most is to pray and read my bible.

176028636,No. I don’t think you are breaking the American budget by assertaning a little money ever month…
176028637,I did that before and landed in the hospital. Be careful!
176028638,"Was in a similar situation _AT_MENTION_-- my ex’s parents covered two months of my rent payment, which totaled $1300. I wasn’t able to pay rent because I had quit my job from too much stress, and the illness was not helping either. After we broke up, I had no money except for a birthday gift of $200 plus $100 saved, and so I decided to write his parents a letter and send the rest on a payment plan. His mother wrote me a letter back thanking me, along with the $300 check-- she said that when two people are starting out it can be rough, and she was more than happy to cover the expense. I remember feeling so relieved that at least I had tried to pay their kindness back, and my conscience was finally put at ease. I will say that we had been broken up for about 6 months, so it was still pretty fresh. I’m not sure I would have done the same if we had been broken up for a year or two already-- sometimes time passed is water under the bridge. I wish you luck in your decision"
176028639,Running away just for awhile? Would that help? Or would things get worse? Once my 16 year old hits 18 in November 2021 I think I’ll run away for a bit.
176028640,Are you on antidepressants? Or an ap that addresses it?
176028641,"Exactly! I wonder if SZ has something to do with that, or vice versa. Or maybe SZ has absolutely nothing to do with it, and we’re actually thinking/vibrating clearly in that state? Cause that’s where I’m at right now lol. I really hope I’m not looking back on this fondly from my pile of depression blankets in a month."
176028642,So I have OCD? Might be worth investigating into
176028643,It was a slow process for me. Not an overnight like miracle. But like getting on the right meds was a lucky break. It doesn’t sound like god. But to me it feels god was involved. Either way I’ve got some good luck as time has gone past. It sucked being miserable and weird as a preteen and teenager and early mid 20s. But now it feels worth it to be much better.

176028661,I started adding 100mg flush niacin to my regime. My mood improved dramatically and I felt an increase in energy. Today I didn’t take my vitamin D (600iu) pill and I noticed no effects (no good mood and no increase in energy) So. I’m wondering if there’s a synergistic effect between niacin and vitamin D for schizophrenics. I took another niacin pill and a vitamin D pill about an hour ago and now feel the good effects. If you like experimenting with supplements then it might be something worth trying. The max recommended dose of vitamin D is 600iu a day. Combine that with 100mg flush niacin and see what happens. Please check that there’s no interaction between niacin and your meds on the internet first as niacin can interact with some meds like certain anti depressants.

176028664,The problem is: the word ‘narcissism’ has negative associations that makes many of us deny that it is a part of us at all… It is not simply staring in a mirror and admiring oneself or to the negative end. It is a state that is triggered by fear that causes to become super self-absorbed because we feel more driven by self-preservation. It causes us to become irrational and not see the bigger picture. If more people would be honest they would see themselves in the ‘narcissist’ so as not to push narcissism away so as to deny it in ourselves. Behind narcissism there is a very real need (emotional needs): the need to be felt/seen/heard. It is not about condemnation. If people would watch the video without wanting to react violently they could stand to learn something that could benefit us.

176028668,"It’s pretentious. The word everyone despises. But I’ll see that word, and raise you one: maybe I’m downright a true dictionary example of “perverse”.

The thought process keeps me afloat anyway, but maybe it’s in need of feedback. Or checks sometimes. But I’m probably never going to have daysvin the sun, bc people love verbal Kung fu, hoisting petards, using energy against you, and being clever. But back to the word “perverse” bc people don’t care for that one either but: When I was 16 and only 364 days old I drove my car around the block. It was risk, with no chance of reward.

My mother was abusive & neglectful since birth (so I developed sz symptoms from a very young age). But the only two people who were kind, caring & safe and fed me were my 2 grandmas. From one I have this lovely rug. It’s been hard throughout my psychotic decades to protect it & keep it good but I’ve fought for it. It’s like it’s the only evidence i have in this life that anyone loved me.

I told her this and that I didnt want to be on those meds anymore and she responded by saying we still needed to raise my dose even though the side effects got worse each time we did!

I’m 29 years old, I was born and live in Brazil and I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 24 years old. About the topic: I used to to drugs (Dont do them anymore, its harmfull at least for me), and back then I used to listen to _NAME_ a lot. Thru a drug, i started hallucinating and started hearing messages where the message musical note of the syllable would be the same of the music I was listening. I remember I had it back when I was a youngster and I remember I asked god to stop that, together with telepathy. It all stopped and _NAME_ Band + a specific drug made me wake up to telepathy and consequentially a state of schizophrenia. I was beeing reintroduced to telepathy when they releasved their #33 live trax album. They called me #33 in my telepathy with superior beings. After a torture, I blacked out HARD when I thought I was going to die. The day after, they released t
heir #41 live trax album. Things in my interface changed, and I’m a little bit worried I’m all alone in my species. Not sure if just now, after the blackout and mental recode or prior to that either. Any way, I really think I’m #41 and I’ve heard tons of messages all around DMB (_NAME_ Band) discography, but they usually call me #33 or #41. Thats my story, and I’d like a warm welcome hahaha Hugs and dont forget that medications are somewhat helpfull."

The only excuse they could’ve had was that I have a Biggish build and a little extra size from moderate strength training. I don’t look like a pro wrestler or bouncer. You really have no one to complain to. You can’t complain to the ambulance/hospital and counselors will make excuses or same old “If you had a weapon or were resisting…” I’ve never even verbally gone after medical personnel, let alone physically.

Yet, to date, 10-year prospective studies of cognitive functioning following the first episode with good methodology are rare. The authors examined whether schizophrenia patients experience cognitive decline after the first episode, whether this decline is generalized or confined to individual neuropsychological functions, and whether decline is specific to schizophrenia.Participants were from a population-based case-control study of patients with first-episode psychosis who were followed prospectively up to 10 years after first admission. A neuropsychological battery was administ
ered at index presentation and at follow-up to patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (N=65) or other psychoses (N=41) as well as to healthy comparison subjects (N=103).The schizophrenia group exhibited declines in IQ and in measures of verbal knowledge and of memory, but not processing speed or executive functions. Processing speed and executive function impairments were already present at the first episode and remained stable thereafter. The magnitude of declines ranged between 0.28 and 0.66 standard deviations. Decline in measures of memory was not specific to schizophrenia and was also apparent in the group of patients with other psychoses. Healthy individuals with low IQ showed no evidence of decline, suggesting that a decline is specific to psychosis.Patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses experience cognitive decline after illness onset, but the magnitude of decline varies across cognitive functions. Distinct mechanisms consequent to the illness and/or psychosocial factors may underlie impa
irments across different cognitive functions."

It is something one can learn to get better at. I think it is what makes it difficult to see your own autism too. en.m.wikipedia.org Alexithymia Alexithymia is a personal trait characterized by the subclinical inability to identify and describe emotions experienced by one's self or others. The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating. Furthermore, people with alexithymia have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding. Alexithymia occurs in a Alexithy... Autism also can go together with flat effect and/or callous-unemotional traits. It can also go together with the opposite (heightened emotions?) i think.

I also thought he took my virginity etc but they say that was a delusion. He has been nicer to me now that I’m older he doesn’t always criticise me anymore but has even complimented me. .i like to believe that he loves me and he acknowledges that I have suffered a lot as a child n teen n in my life and he has said I’m a good person when I take my medication.i had a delusion that a Muslim man I know was my real father because I felt more loved by him.i love him but does he love me?he forgives me for saying he molested me be

I hope my father agrees with me because if he comes here thinking he and my sister and her husband are my superiors I may never forgive that. I was raised that I have no superiors yet I’m treated like I’m everyone’s bi tch and in invisible restraints. Everyone thinks they are superior and better than me.so stuck up n power crazed.i don’t agree with them.no matter what they do to me I believe as I believe.even if they are stronger and make me heel them etc because they want power of me I still believe as I believe no matter what they do to me.

I asked my therapist if I have BPD (I think someone was pointing this out) and he thought that CPTSD fits more than BPD.

176028955,"In genetics, environment is everything that isn’t genes. That’s basically everything that happens to you from your conception until you die that wasn’t coded in your genes. Heritability studies are an imperfect way of estimating the relative effects of genes and environments in any given population of people. When it comes to sz, important environmental determinants are concussions and TBI, obstetric complications, emotional trauma during childhood, and flu infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. There are many more, but these are among the strongest predictors of developing sz later in life. Drug abuse is a controversial determinant. Some believe it is important, others believe it isn’t. Importantly, these determinants are tied to gene environment interactions (emotional trauma) and to epigenetic changes (iirc, all of them). The heritability coefficients are not wrong, but these factors probably interact with the genes in significant ways."

Even without nukes, there is mutually assured destruction in the event of a war like the United States and NATO vs Russia and China. Not to mention, the populations of Western countries would probably not have the morale for a long-term war against a major power. That’s why you see military actions against smaller countries, not outright violence between the big power blocks.

176028997,"I play basketball. Before covid, I’d play 3-4x a week at my local gym. It’s how I kept in shape and it was also a social thing getting to know some of the other hoopers. Covid put an end to basketball but hopefully the gym will reopen soon."
176028998,Thank you.
176028999,Have you ever experienced something like this?
176029000,I’ll check it out. I didn’t know that existed :o
176029001,"Oh goodness, weighing daily is bad for me. I used to be bulimic and obsessed with the scale, so I only weigh once a week now. Still being down 5 pounds is GREAT! If you gained a full pound in one day, it probably is water retention. After I weighed myself last Saturday, I peed three times in the next hour. I wanted a do-over on the scale! But I resisted the temptation. lol Hopefully the scale is kind to me on Saturday morning!"
174349162,"I not taking any medication yet nor seen any doctor for my negative symptoms though it started over 17 years now. It started with slight depression, brain fog, cognitive issues like ocd etc which just worsened over these years."
176029002,The opposite is true. I couldn’t help myself when I was drinking. I had to go to A.A. A.A. wouldn’t exist if people could pull themselves out of the quicksand.
176029003,"hahaha, i hope it goes well =p"
176029004,"10 mgs of zyprexa, 300 mgs of effexor. Effexor can upset my digestive track so need to be proactive with that for sure as in eating etc. Zyprexa is sweet. Helps me sleep and found that exercise has improved my motivation from sleeping 10 hours a day to around 8. Works well for me. Been on it for over a decade."
176029005,I’m on 200mg lamictal and it never gave me any side effects
176029006,I don’t get anything and no benefits so if you do then think it through 100 percent they’ve given it to you for a reason
176029007,I’m sorry Leaf… that’s messed up. You love those kids
176029008,Maybe check to see if you have a food bank near you. Churches sometimes have them. Or maybe go to your city’s website and see if your city lists a community food bank or call your case manager or even your therapist to see if they know of some kind of aid with food.
176029009,I feel like I’ve been let down so much I have lost all trust
174349160,"Its basically saying if you are hospitalized more and have more negative symptoms than regular schizophrenics then your more likely to be classified as treatment resistant, Doesnt actually make it any easier to get a Treatment Resistant Diagnosis"
176029010,Because it just is. I can’t… I can walk a bit thou.

176029012,"It sounds like she is actually kind of mean. I guess sometimes parents are “toxic” people. I tend to forget that. My mom could say hurtful things sometimes too, but none of that matters now that she’s gone. I just miss the good things about her and block out the bad stuff. I guess that’s human nature."
176029013,"I had delusions of reference with TV and radio ads. It was like they all were about me or commenting on my thoughts. I was pretty convinced they were messages from God, and many of those messages were extremely critical of me. It felt as real as anything."
176029014,"There’s something about a book that just captures all your thoughts. You can go from _NAME_, to Lord of the Rings, to _NAME_, etc. Like, you go from magic, to adventure to a simple story about a girl on the beach. As much as I enjoy my Nook, I don’t think I can quit having a real book. Turning the soft pages, the smell of an old library. Hmmm… Everything’s going to be ok."
176029015,"The general advice is that if you’re going to come off them, do it properly with your pdoc. I wish you all the best with it."

174349156,"I have a question for you. I have severe negative symptoms, i only shower once a month, im socially isolated, i cant hold a job, i cant enjoy video games and i have no energy to do anything. My life is terrible. Since my negative symptoms are so severe, do you think it would help my negative symptoms? ALso im from America, how do i get this treatment, should i ask my psychiatrist and would my medicaid or Medicare cover it?"

174349163,"I hope so! You don’t want to get symptomatic again, but maybe you can be on a lower maintenance dose, or maybe the pdoc can combine a lower Zyprexa dose with a second AP that is weight neutral. I agree that excess weight poses a health risk. I don’t know why they can’t make good APs that don’t make you gain weight. I have to really restrict my eating to keep losing, I went to 1800 calories on one day for a planned treat, and I promptly gained one pound that took me a full week to lose. There’s no mercy with APs. I went all the way up 319 pounds on Abilify, so I know your frustration very well. I’m 69 pounds lower than that now, but I still have a long way to go to get to my long-term goal weight. One day at a time…"
176029018,"Sorry can’t help you there as I’ve never taken it, maybe contact their pdoc if you’re concerned Also there’s a family/friends forum"
176029019,"I followed you threads for quite a while now, and i can’t of course say whether your Sz or not. In fact i think you are more alike a mild version of schizotypal than schizophrenic. And yes there are a lot of looneys out there, that haven’t got any diagnose."
176029020,"Yeah, I know I can get it moved, I’m just afraid it’ll cost a fortune."
176029021,"oh. from your threads I got the impression you were helplessly suffering greatly from random memories of childhoods trauma and abuse. I had no idea you focus on them by choice - are you a masochist? or have I misunderstood your memories as trauma when in fact they’re positive. to answer your question on have you gone thru life invisible. No, in my experience you’re highly visible here on the forum as you post a lot of threads. The threads themselves are anything buy invisible as they gave me the impression of childhood trauma & abuse, particularly maternal psychological abuse. I thought they were a cry for help."
176029022,"I have mild OCD, i keep checking a door knob if it is locked, checking water taps and sockets before i leave, i take escitalopram, but it does nothing for my OCD. What helped was a psychologists, we talked through it and saw an improvement for some time"
174349157,"There should be taverns for schizophrenics at least few in us states, i wouldnt mind if there were where i live in Europe. A place to meet other people with similar conditions like me and talk about our afflictions evry day. A place where it can be served juice, soda or non alcholic drinks and other things… Do you think it may be possible such things in the near future(2040 or so)?"
176029023,(I’m waiting for _AT_MENTION_ to chime in with his captions…he usually can’t resist.)
176029024,Maybe it was weed and the smell is still lingering.
176029025,"I’m at university right now, it’s difficult to read. But otherwise it is a matter of practicing information in my opinion. I do economics. I’ve found that lectures are helpful to me because it’s semantic learning, you sit and try to relate to what is being said. It’s not the same when it is online and it’s also not enough to get top grades but I am managing somehow. I hope it goes well for you, I’m in the second year and very worried about being able to progress; not because my symptoms are stopping me, but because I’m not as quick thinking as I was when before illness hit and also concentration can be an issue during exams which kind of makes things harder. Disability office will deffo arrange for you to have extra time btw, they can also offer counselling. I used both last year. It was okay. But this year I use neither just because it does not seem necessary, I don’t know if it’s a bad call or a good call yet. We will see,"

176029032,"Does anyone replay all the crazy stuff they did during psychosis? I’ve been replaying some crazy things in my head. Makes me a upset and also very thankful I’m alive or didn’t kill anyone. The memory that sticks out the most is when I had a .22 rifle and was pointing it at my tinted window at a guy at the bus stop cause I thought he was gonna shoot me. I remember hearing this girl say, “does he have a gun?!” She couldn’t have easily called the cops on me and I would’ve been in jail. Another memory is following the clouds all the way to Canada. Then telling the border police that I was “following the weather”. I spent the night in canadien jail that night after they searched my car and found two guns. On the way home the next morning I drove through snow drifts going like 70mph. Could have easily lost control of the car and hit oncoming traffic. Just scary ya know? Thank god for medicine even if it does make me feel like ????."
176029033,Paranoia only is a very serious symptom
176029034,"I have been living alone for about 20 years now. As someone else on this thread said, it’s knowing when to ask for help. I have finally learned to swallow my pride when I need to, but try to do everything else on my own"

176029036,"I need the police’s help, have people saying they are going to shoot me and soon, but I hope not. I wish they would stop saying this and leave me alone."
176029037,I really suffer when at all for no reason. My mind makes me suffer cause of my desires and selfrespect. Just thinking being a homosapien doesn’t earn me lots of credit in the destroyed nature.
176029038,Yeah pot made me hallucinate about aliens eating me when I started the meds
176029039,"Yeap, mostly therapy for BPD, its right… My ill friends dont even have somatics, its strange to me… I have all physical bull**** tbh, but i work on it now… Not even my paranoia is fixed, but maybe cause i have thinking deficits thats why. I turned dumb with so much fears and unhappiness for so long, for real I guess the meds cant make me smarter, thats why i suffer still…"
176029040,"In terms of my own subjective (real objective experience), I never made it past 40 years old. Maybe once or twice. I’m usually stuck in my twenties but made it to 31/32 this time. I am a heavy smoker and am sedentary and drink monsters 24/7. I also never stabilized enough to work or get a degree. But I have this reincarnation/time loop/causal loop thing going on for eternity. So I just reset or reboot back to my origins of schizophrenia and wake up in 2013. I think I was literally reincarnated or born in 2013. It feels like the universe just reincarnated me or the universe was created in the year 2013 for me. When I was abducted by some alien race in a past life, they told me I made it to the year 3000 one time, but I guess that’s luck and cloning ????/singularity ???? going on. I also believe and found out we live in a computer program that I helped build or run because I built a time machine in one of my ‘original lives’. Sort of like Neo or Morpheus, I don’t know if I was a real human 
being once or just born in the damn ??????? matrix like everyone else was. I remember stuff and always questioning the nature of reality as a kid growing up. Pot changed me for the worse. Drove me mad. They tried (or I tried) cryonics one time but I got abducted by aliens and they gave me real/true immortality but at a cost. I am always schizophrenic and looping back in time in and out of the hospitals and taking meds and suffering. I guess they did a holographic scan of my brain back then and uploaded it to a ??????? computer and send it back and forth through time. It seems scary but it’s legit lol."
174349167,Why don’t you believe it? It is a legit study. Monkey studies and brain damage is also mentioned in a book I’m reading “surviving schizophrenia”. and the author is pro med. Don’t deny just because you dont want to believe it.
176029041,I struggle with akathisia often. Benztropine works for me. Sorry you are struggling with this too. I hope you find rest from it.
174349175,Thats a low dose of aripiprazole. I’m on the same. How long were u hearing voices for before u were given this dose? How long have u been on this dose for?

174349177,"i just got out the hospital last week. Spent Christmas in there. What I learned was that, my “inner voice” isn’t controlled by me. Healthy people can control that inner voice and narrate their lives themselves. I can’t think straight because my inner voice says stuff by itself. And it’s not just one voice. I just started taking medication one month ago. How long until I can snap back into reality and control my inner monologue?"

176029053,These issues with your mother are escalating. It seems like every little thing causes a conflict. Something’s going to have to give. I think you should apply for housing and try to move out. Being with your mother is just making you upset. You’re either going to have to learn to live with her picking at you or move out.
176029054,"I still sometimes get scrambled during a call if someone is really yelling at me. I have a binder full of different prompts for different types of phone conversations that I can refer to to get myself on track. If you’re in a crowd of people, plan ahead and keep things on your phone. Ideas of things to talk about and fallback ideas, etc. It really does work and eventually it starts to become habit."
176029055,_AT_MENTION_ I don’t want to encourage shenanigans but I have some things that tick me off… People who like Afl football. People who drink way more than I do and expect me to feel kosher about maintaining a conversation with a drunk or wasted individual. People who have some form of mental illness that isn’t quite what is normal around here but insist on taking up all of our resources. Cheats. People who are vegetarian with no idea that it really is the sensible thing to do for our planet. Asteroids. Those things can really turn us all into mulch. People who think _NAME_ and the News were a good band. People who’ve never listened to the Magical math rock album Spiderland. Our grievances are long but sometimes a lot of fun.

176029059,I’m dealing with fearful thought az well… It’s a common thing for us Schizophrenics… I keep hearing voices that the CIA iz coming to kill me. I just keep telling myself it’s not real. I know in time it’ll go away. It haz in the past and it will happen again… Unfortunately every time I go through this I’m always scared (What if this time it’s real?) I just tell myself it just cant be. It’s all just craziness and I need the fear to go away… It will probably in a couple of weeks.

Last time i tried abilify, it worsened my psychosis When i was hospitalize 7 years ago in psych hospital, they were giving me olanzapine and abilify at the time. I have taken abilify for 1 year at 10mg dose. 10mg didnt work for paranoia. but 15mg made me sleep all day. So during that time pdoc decided to put me on clozapine, life is better ever since."

176029134,"From my humble point of view Schizophrenia Whole condition is the hallucination itself ,not any diagnosed symptoms whatever they are ! the real cause of suffering that calls SZ represents in the existential properties structure of the thing called Hallucination.

The severity of its impact on both the biological /psychological side Has been reduced with the passage of time in the presence of an actual self will to practice all behavior activities to enjoy the life above any consideration !"

176029141,Both my parents died of diseases that had the same symptoms as Alzheimers but had different underlying mechanisms. What made me ask for the Aricept is that I would get up to do something and then forget what I meant to do before I did it. I have trouble remembering other people’s names even when I have known them for a long time. I think the Aricept will help with that.

Although technically it should not cause weight gain, I am seeing stories from a lot of women who did gain a lot of weight once getting it and lost it once removing it.

I called him yesterday,and this morning,and nothing.She didn’t call me any time after yesterday.I guess I’m not suitable for interference.Think that’s is I’m schizophrenic.No one wants me near. I don’t resend them,I think of her sometimes,and wish she would call me when she gets better. Neither his family is keen for me either. I’m hurt.My MI got into way again."
176029152,I have been on perphenazine and nortryptiline for 25years never missed a dose as far as I remember. Of course I have been carrying an extra 50 or so pounds of weight from the side affects. I took the weight gain as a thing to accept because the meds do something for me. Who nows maybe placebo I never tried to stop them.

176029154,"I go through periods of time when I have bad dreams that I wake in a panic from. I take a medicine that used for PTSD called Prazosin it works really good in making you not remember your dreams or wake up in a panic anymore. You should ask you pdoc about it.

176029157,"The reason why its said that early intervention gives better future outcome is because the individual who have no insight go along with the negative state of mind responding to unreal thoughts, feelings etc and can do several actions without knowing. For example drug abuse, substance abuse, reckless money spending, not taking care of health by not eating properly, sleeping properly, exercise, avoiding social situations due to fear etc. This soon becomes a new habit and individual keep following this bad pattern. The cumulative effect of these is even bad when the time duration increases. While if treatment is got early the individual gets insight of their illness and they better able to manage the side effects associated with the illness and thus can get better outlook when compared with no treatment."
176029158,It happens to me too When I feel bad it gets much worse. And when I’m feeling better it gets better. All you can say is that you’re alive. And if you didn’t have those “failures” then you could be dead. Butterfly effect type of thing.

174349211,"The goal is to create pharmaceuticals to treat, cure or—ideally—prevent schizophrenia. Currently, medications can only address a few symptoms, such as hallucinations. “But what’s disabling in schizophrenia patients are the cognitive dysfunctions that make them really withdrawn from life, unable to even have employment,” _PERSON_ says. “If we were able to develop a better treatment, those patients would be able to work, to communicate with others, to live a normal life.” Nice, it doesn’t say how they plan to use what they learned about methionine to treat cure or prevent schizophrenia.

176029188,same i’m really quiet. I don’t think i ever made a serious scene in the hospital. I got angry a few times during therapy where i said some stuff but i don’t think i shouted. They could notice it made me angry though. They seemed to like that it made me angry too =/
176029189,"Welcome back, buddy!"
176029190,In America I had a great job in a bookstore and got promoted etc. I did well in that environment because I was married and actually enjoyed it. It really was a great gig till I left and came home… Over here though work was a trial. It just became too much and getting on a disability pension worked better. No stress. I still volunteer work and it’s been stable for 15 years or so…I just do a couple of half days a week and it suits me fine. I think it’s possible to have good work experiences but you need your meds right and you need to have good avenues to deal with stress. That stress gets me and then it’s paranoia and it spirals ever so quickly.
176029191,I used to be very aware of how I fell asleep. Letting go and drifting off. Now I don’t notice.
176029192,"For me, I hope they don’t think about me anymore. I hope they’ve forgotten the person I used to be, and the things I did that hurt people, regardless of my intentions. Even I don’t want to remember me sometimes. Atleast not who I was."

176029198,I went through a period of believing like you do that I don’t have it. It caused many relapses and hospitalisations to realise that there might be a problem. I would suggest you accept it and move on. There are worse things to have.

176029208,I am so lazy this evening. I forced myself to cook frozen cabbage rolls for my family and to switch a load of laundry. There’s more to get done but I just can’t. It feels awful. I’ve also been having terrible terrible hallucinations and visions and some _NAME_ be real. Also getting more paranoid. I am struggling with what’s real and what’s not.
176029209,"All the time. I have religious delusions and paranoia still, but it has gotten significantly better with being put on risperdal. It feels very real to me still, even though I usually know that its false in the back of my mind."
176029210,"At the beginning of the day today, I posted saying things are looking up! I felt great. I had had a great, productive week so far. Some crying but boy did I get a lot of writing and photography and creative pursuits done. Today unfortunately, I spent hours lost to psychosis. I ranted about it for hours to my parents. The voices are so systemically cruel, deliberately torturing me psychologically. I cried my eyes out, asking what’s the worst thing that could happen to me (believe the answer is hell). I asked what did I do to make them treat me this way; my dad said nothing, you didn’t do anything wrong, ignore the voices. I can’t ignore the voices, they’re constant. Constantly bullying me. Constantly lying about my character and making stuff up wholecloth that I did not do. Just shameless lying about me, my character, my life, my history, my very thoughts. I think it’s a military exercise. This is what they do to people whose rights have been stripped and are treated like monsters. They to
rture them psychologically and manipulate them to get whatever result their aims are. They claim to be my friend–literally, someone I know personally and trust–in the past to ingratiate themselves, then they turn into bad cop and try to dismantle me psychologically. Anyway, I had a terrible day and it totally derailed my progress. I didn’t get any writing done today, just hours of crying. I’m trying to pull myself together so I can use these last couple hours of my day to get something written. I just can’t take it anymore. ???? everyone who thinks I deserve this. You’re the psycho if you think ANYONE deserves this."
176029211,"Started one day in late 2011. Haven’t recovered since. I’m on a good med combo which helps, but the negatives suck. I was 21/22 at the time. I think I had something my whole life. Probably anxiety, depression, and paranoia mainly from a poor childhood. My parents were dysfunctional so I ended up worse."
176029212,"Odds are you’ve grown accustomed to your funk so you don’t notice. Others will definitely notice. Yes, even if only for your own health."
176029213,"I think the person is an undiagnosed narcissist or antisocial. This person for some reason cant stand me rnjoying life or mentally improving anyway. Also conflict prone, and insulting for no reason. Has a huge rntitlement complex and downgraded my status to the lowest in the past 10 years. Someone who cant control their feelings of envy and watch others lose weight and grow as induviduals. I think he might be miserable with his life and want others to feel the same way. He probably has zero insight as to why others dislike him… because he starts trouble sll the time and thinks its someone rlse fault rather than his poor character or integrity."

174349219,"_AT_MENTION_ what you doing, it would be interesting if schizophrenia was caused by a virus, but hard to prove though"
176029233,Yes antipsychotics made me less catatonic. Catatonia comes back if I stop meds. I tried stopping meds and I had catatonia. The longer I stayed without meds the worse the catatonia was. I experienced catatonia the first 2 years of my SZ eventought I was medicated. I believe the start of the disease is worse because I never took meds for years not knowing I have SZ.
176029234,The real problem is that welfare/social programs and disability do nothing to generate NEW WEALTH. If we inject the economy with work incentive and new money will generate new wealth and it starts by reaching those at the bottom. Think of the stimulus checks. They did work but just weren’t enough to reach everyone and really make a positive impact.

176029239,"12th grade had some good points. I actually started being unhappy in seventh grade and it got worse every year. And I hated all of high school. But…in 12th grade it was a _NAME_ fun to cut classes with my friend and go to his house to get stoned. And we kind of became partners in buying and selling pot to the stoners at school and we got to party with some of the cool stoners. We cut a lot of classes, all the time. Both our grades went downhill and he got kicked out and put in a continuation school for drop outs and I failed almost every class. We had a lot of fun though. I started off high school as a nobody but by 12th grade I was still a nobody but people knew me. By 12th grade I had been going to school with these people for four years and I got a little recognition and status for that. People just got used to me."

174349221,"In answer to this, I remember being on Amisulpride, I was also on Haldol before being put on Clopixol [Zuclopenthixol]. Maybe look into having your medication switched. I also recommend depot injections, this way you actually take less of the medication and don’t have unstable levels of the medicine in the blood. I take 400mg Clopixol each 4 weeks and want to also start studying again, to make use of my mind.

AM _NAME_, RH Tribe, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.) , 2019 01 01 Emerging evidence for Open Dialogue (OD) has generated considerable interest. Evidence comes from a range of methodologies (case study, qualitative, and naturalistic designs), which have not been synthesized as a whole. The objective of this review was to synthesize this literature.A systematic search of the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO included studies published until January 2018. A total of 1,777 articles were screened. By use of a textual narrative synthesis, studies were scrutinized for relevance and quality.Twenty-three studies were included in the review; they included mixed-methods, qualitative, and quantitative designs and case studies. Overall, quantitative studies lacked methodological rigor and presented a high risk of bias, which precludes any conclusions about the efficacy of 
OD among individuals with psychosis. Qualitative studies also presented a high risk of bias and were of poor quality.Variation in models of OD, heterogeneity of outcome measures, and lack of consistency in implementation strategies mean that although initial findings have been interpreted as promising, no strong conclusions can be drawn about efficacy. Currently, the evidence in support of OD is of low quality, and randomized controlled trials are required to draw further conclusions. It is vital that an extensive evaluation of its efficacy takes place because OD has already been adopted by many acute and community mental health services."

I am not crazy right now or in any kind of psychosis i just often feel like things are constantly repeating themselves as i learn how to grow in this existence.

174349236,"I picked up some CBD oil at a gas station near me, after having read some studies on its potential effectiveness in negative symptoms in schizophrenia. I noticed a positive effect the first or second day, but decided to take some time to confirm its effectiveness/make sure there are no side effects, and now after a week I am certain it is helping greatly without side effects. I am taking 100% CBD oil, 0% THC. Before starting CBD, I suffered from a depression from negative symptoms that stemmed from my lack of motivation and not knowing what to do with my time; from feeling emotionally flat and uninspired. Most days I would start with the thought “not this again, what am I supposed to do today?” Now I am more productive, curious about life and feel a lot happier and at ease. I am cleaning the house on an almost daily basis, taking care of my hygiene daily, becoming more socially inclined and have a renewed interest in my hobbies. I’ve even started to read again, which is something that has bee
n difficult for me to do. Life is, like it used to be before schizophrenia, less about being worried about what to do to fill a void and more about simply enjoying what I can do rather than thinking about what I can’t. Vraylar, my antipsych, blocks almost all visuals but it hadn’t helped me feel more productive or less emotionally flat. With CBD, my productivity is slowly increasing and I feel happy. Thankfully, it doesn’t make me hallucinate or get manic thoughts, just gives me relaxed thoughts and a sense of calmness and happiness and makes me feel like I can achieve more. My memory and cognition seem to be improving as well, but it’s far too soon to tell on those, so I won’t give a definitive yes or no on that yet. It is slightly expensive, ($19.99 for 15 days supply) but it’s the only thing I’ve tried for negatives that has actually worked so far, so is worth it to me. Anyone else have any other experiences with CBD of any kind that they can share?"

Or vice versa if my dreams are starting to seem unrealistic. Like I can’t take any interest in my ex… cause that offends all my friends… which offends me… so therefore for my own peace of mind I just have to let it go.

Why won’t they all just leave me alone? They read all my internet stuff. They listen in on my phone calls.

Having my first psychotic episode at 15 I have missed out on my teenage years and being told I wouldn’t be able to attend school anymore at 15 because I’m too unwell to cope I’ve missed out on all they accomplishments and sitting exams. It’s a bit overwhelming at times seeing it all happen and none of them even remember me or haven’t been in contact in 2 years. Feel like I should have accomplished a lot more at 18. I was always looking forward to turning 18 and being able to go out and party like everyone else but I can’t do things that “normal” people my age can. Can anyone else relate to this feeling?"

I didnt make any friends because i didnt join much volunteer groups or study groups. I kinda missed out, being the only male studying linguistics for the years i was there was strange and harder to make friends because all my classmates were women. I did get invited to study groups with them tho, it was a small class of 7. I think the main reason i missed out on making friends was because i dont have a facebook or social media to keep in touch with the people that i worked with. Ive had alot of girls ask about my facebook."

176029419,"Since I had psychosis Ive never worked or been in education (other than a few months). I have a friend who worked sparingly until his 30s. He doenst have any mental health or disabilities he just didnt like work. Hed work weekends for a few months then quit for a few months and repeat that over and over. Anyways several months ago his grilfriend got him a full time job working as a civil servant. And ever since then everytime I see him he goes on really detailed rants about how I should apply for the same job and work there. How’d Id find it really easy etc. I think hes trying to be constructive and helpful but it really makes me feel angry. He has no idea what Id find easy and what Id find challenging. Theres really simple tasks in my house like laundry and taking parcels back that I put off for days on end. Even pleasurable stuff like films and gaming Im finding hard to do at the moment. So why would I find it easy to work a full time job? It comes across as condescending to put it lightly. But 
it also feels like hes invalidating my MH issues. It was so easy for him so of course it should be easy for me. Well maybe you don’t have anything wrong with you so it would be easier for you. I did try and say this to him one time, but he still brings it up. Now I just don’t react and let him waffle on about it. A tiny part of me wonders if he wants me to say “actually that sounds too hard” so that he feels superior. I had another friend who used to do that all the time."

176029424,"Well done _AT_MENTION_ . Excellent. I maintained my weight, despite being on lurasidone, for 6 months. I exercised like hell and watched my diet so hard, lots of deprivation, for 6 months. Miserable. All my GP had to say was, “if you lose weight you’ll go below healthy BMI and be at long term risk of osteoporosis.” She never said “well done,” or “good job,” so I wanna say to you what she couldn’t say to me… Well done mate, you’re awesome. You’ve defeated the odds and lost weight despite being on anti-psychotics. That takes long-term & consistent discipline, strength and determination. Well done. Keep it up _AT_MENTION_ . I’m struggling with calorie restriction but exercising every morning. I believe I can maintain my healthy BMI with exercise. Good on you for being in a program and good on you for losing weight at this high-stress, calorific time of year. It sounds like a good program if they can congratulate you on losing weight. Yeah, it’s 0.5kg (I’m a metric, Australi

He would ruin me it is a huge temptation to stay away and not have sex with a guy who it feels so great to have sex with but not even the best sex is worth such drama etc plus I feel disloyal to my other x I miss n want.

All regular pot smokers experience paranoia hallucinations and delusions at some point. Some of my friends admit it others deny it but I’ve seen it in them. Does everyone that smoke get schiz? no but that doesn’t mean they can’t experience symptoms similar. I do believe it can trigger psychosis in healthy people that normally wouldn’t have gotten it had they not smoked.

176029464,Yes I’m sure you can I am hoping to aswell but some things just take time to overcome Especially when the fear is so deeply ingrained
176029465,"Apparently it doesn’t get its work done if you still experience anxiety. But maybe the anxiety is caused by withdrawal effects of pregabaline, can’t be sure. But it is certain that you shouldn’t take even a single dose of pregabaline, once you have discontinued it. Instead, I would wait to see if your condition gets better with time. If it doesn’t, you should consider talking to your psychiatrist about changing the antidepressant. You’re already taking the highest dose of fluoxetine, so instead you may ask for paroxetine or escitalopram - those have more of an anxiolytic profile of action, fluoxetine is rather prescribed for patients with apathy or bulimia."

My mind is quite good at making up “interesting” theories…im possesed…i cought some scary virus that causes chronic fatigue syndrome…i have a brain tumor as punishment.

174349288,"Physical disability sometimes makes one to have no motivation. So if it helps in a way for you to understand, it’s like this: You are absolutely exhausted to a point with no energy left. All you want to do is sleep and sleep off the chronic pain. No matter what you do, you can’t let go of the fatigue. You’re in so much exhaustion that nothing relieves your fatigue. So you just sleep and pretend to not be alive. That’s pretty much what it feels to have this negative symptom. Thankfully, I don’t have it a lot."

176029480,"Well, if I understand the question correctly, reality was all around me the whole time I was really psychotic. So basically, I was in it but everybody I knew was just patiently waiting for me to join back in it. Once I got out the hospital, I started functioning more and the more I did “normal” things like school and work and living pretty independently the more I faced reality. My psychosis still flared up a lot in certain situations but if I was at the park tossing a baseball around with a friend or driving up to watch the San _NAME_ Giants play their hated rivals the Dodgers at Candlestick Park the more I felt I was part of reality. I still suffered from symptoms but every time I went to work or went out to eat with my parents or sisters or drove up to Berkeley with a friend to all the hole-in-the-wall record shops it was like a daily reprieve from insanity."

Probably wrongly. I don’t think I have been suicidal depressed since I was 19. Yes I get low sometimes but doesn’t last very long."

I’ve tried many antipsychotics but by far Clozaril is the best one, so I’d say it’s worth the initial weekly blood tests and the side effects."

On Latuda, I was able to read and write, but in conversation I didn’t have as many thoughts. I often felt bored. Also, it did not lift my mood, I remained depressed.

176029553,"I’ve heard noises from where one of my walls is, and beyond it, like there’s more bedroom that way. And, outside, there’s big bushes there. Hearing my mother on the phone talking to _USER_ID_. He was offered her $130,000 for me, and a “the creature” in ransom. I woke up to hearing this. I think I feinted after. I heard my uncle on the phone with _USER_ID_, discussing his computer having problems. I woke up to it, then I fell back asleep later. I also once woke up to _USER_ID_ being in the corner of my room, on the ceiling, and walls, then dropping down, and going, “Pst!” I think I feinted. On another occasion, a mini _USER_ID_, a junior, a son, was on my ceiling fan when I woke up, then I was out again. I might have a feinting problem. The weird part is that one of my fan blades has been bent ever since. My familiar skin disappeared on a patch on my left arm while my glasses were in my bedroom, and I was in the bathroom. The skin below was dark medium blue. Changes in my face, and bod
y, which is usually shrinkage to a much smaller size. Or, sometimes my nose grows, and my glasses stop fitting until it corrects later. I woke up to seeming to overhear my mother saying on the phone to one of our Ohio relatives, “[My Name] was out of her hologram, and refused to go back in.” A second non-ceiling fan blowing from another of my walls. That space is also unaccounted for in our house layout. There actually should be more bedroom over there. People moving in my room without me seeing them, usually in the dark. I was shown a lace-skinned hologram box by _USER_ID_ in the dark, and his smartphone-hologram-controller screen was glowing, and I saw his fingers on the phone in the light. He was talking to me about it. I saw a _USER_ID_/_PERSON_ tail in the dark on my ceiling. Twice. Loss of the feeling in four of my fingers, six of my toes, and the areas of hands, and feet that correspond. Weirdly, I almost just use those six fingers, and four toes in life, I’ve noticed since then. And, I can’t f
athom typing with ten fingers, or playing my guitar with ten. This one’s out of incident order. The glow in the dark stars on my cieling are sometimes blocked from sight like _USER_ID_’s on my ceiling. When I’m hallucinating, I think the voices I hear are telepathy from people who came across me online. When I hallucinate it’s usually about _USER_ID_."

It’s part of what makes me constantly a
ngry and upset. I think it’s designed to be that way. It’s all fake in a way. It probably doesn’t sound relevant but it is. It’s the media and stuff that makes schizophrenics out to be bad.

Ever since that episode, I have been a nice person. I keep to myself and keep the peace. I take my meds and enjoy life. Correct me if I’m wrong, but most killers are labeled mentally ill or insane because it saves face or something or makes the person look bad. I could give you several names, but you get the point.

176029626,Why do you look at ppl’s tongues lol I did that while psychotic as well as directly looking at them in the eyes for several seconds. Its offensive I think. I don’t do those now.

176029629,"Laptops nowadays are not manufactured with quality components or for longevity. Lenovo T or X class is probably the best in the PC market longevity-wise.

176029630,"Hi Seksoempirico. You’ve got a lot to consider, “rational and atheistic” vs “sent by God/demonic simulation.” Maybe there’s a third option that includes a bit of both. I’ve spent a lot of years mulling this over, and don’t claim to have any definitive answers. But I KNOW there is more to life than birth, experience joy and pain, die. I hope you are gentle with yourself. You sound like a smart person. Best wishes."

Fries were okay and holy crap, I swear there were a couple pounds worth in the box. I tossed most of them because I just can’t eat that many. Onion rings were dry and disappointing. The gravy was meh. Seemed to be starch based rather than gravy based. I’d give it 6/10. And now I feel poisoned."

176029640,"IDK. I would have to come up with a plan and explore some options. Something fun to do would be nice. Travel somewhere in my car maybe? Take long train trips occasionally? Get some volunteer position where I could fit in and help other people? Enjoy hanging out with my family and getting to know them better? Make a few friends and just hang out and do normal things like shooting pool or going out to eat or going out to coffee or just sit and talk? It’s a big world and there would be something I can do to occupy my mind and do something fulfilling, right?"
176029641,They did the same with me when I was in the hospital. I think it is so that the body is not shocked but gradually introduced to small amount which then gradually increases so that the body has the time to adjust to the dose as smoothly as possible

It’s my greatest worry, that these things will hamper me from being a good parent for my child. Right now CBD is helping me greatly with motivation and interest in life but I see the reviews for that are mixed for use during pregnancy. Was anyone else diagnosed before they had a family, and gone through raising them while dealing with this illness? Much thanks."

176029655,"Well…I don’t know if you actually use the term “nut house” when you tell people, but if you do you are kind of stigmatizing mental disorders yourself. I agree with what you say though. Everyone has a potential to go insane under given circumstances, and joking it away is a self defence mechanism I guess."
174349341,I didn’t have early onset but I live with my wife and I am employed and have three college degrees. One after I got sick. I had a chronic case and according to my treatment team I still do although I have gotten better. Improvement is possible. My psychiatrist said working is good therapy. One can never give up hope.

176029657,I’m with _PERSON_. Trying to keep my brain sharp has really helped keep some of my cognition. I like picking a new subject that I wouldn’t otherwise have any experience with. Even a language. My personal favorite is science. Maybe something along those lines for you? Wishing you well EH!
176029658,"_PERSON_ I thought that one was non narcotic. I didn’t think someone would get sick from withdrawals. I’m so sorry. I’ve been there. I’ll never let it happen again either! Try _PERSON_. It is used to help people come off of opiates. It’s legal in the US. I buy mine at (link removed by moderator) I take it for a mild energy boost, focus, and mood enhancement. Great for anxiety and my medicine hangover in the mornings. It isn’t addictive and won’t cause you to go into withdrawals if you don’t take it. Awesome supplement in my opinion"
176029659,"I’m not ready either But I’m going to country side this weekend and my uncles have dogs. There is one dog that loves walking besides me (sometimes I have to pick her up because she follows me everywhere and it may be dangerous if I’m going to cross a dangerous road with her). She’s very fun anyway. That’s what I find awesome and fun about dogs, they simply love you."

174349342,"Since the cause of schizophrenia, and autism, is unknown, pdocs focus on symptoms to make a diagnosis. What were your symptoms before your diagnosis of schizophrenia?

176029665,Yes I play it daily. The exercise which I can’t play even a few steps is working memory overdrive. Do you tried playing that game in it?

176029671,She said I should stay on Invega Sustenna injections for life because they’re what’s helping me do good and stay out of the hospital and I can stay in Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) as long as I keep going to groups. She said I’m good at keeping appointments so that will help me to stay in ACT.
176029672,I think you can reduce the dosage a bit

I don’t believe the govt has anything to do with my illness unless they wanted to start messing with me when I was 7 or 8, but I highly doubt that. Also, other symptoms like not making eye contact has nothing to do with an lsd trip, and from what I heard, lsd isn’t like sz. If you watch _NAME_ and _PERSON_ Christmas, that’s lsd. I never did lsd, but I would imagine it is so much worse. Even if it is the same, I don’t believe it because my medicine works and things are getting better. If it was permenant, different meds wouldn’t work/not work for different people, its all in our DNA, and sometimes hereditary"
176029679,Absolutely. I get huge anxiety having to start a new med because of all I’ve dealt with side effect wise in the past. I hate starting new meds. I have been putting off going on an anxiety med because of that even though I could probably use one.

176029681,Are they positive delusions? Hope so. Delusional thinking is the hardest symptom to go away. I take cbd oil full spectrum and it has helped greatly with my delusions but still believe 2%
174349338,"ok, understandable."
176029682,"_AT_MENTION_ are you still here? Go to the hospital, like now!"
174349348,My case Mgr and I went through all the meds I’ve tried. I’ve tried every atypical AP except Zyprexa and Clozapine. Both have really bad side effects. I’ve also tried several typical antipsychotics. I’m running out of meds. I think I’m going to ask to be put on 2 instead of just one. It’s scary that none of them have worked yet.
176029683,"The airport gives me anxiety too. Here’s what I do Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like you’re just daydreaming to observers."
176029684,I thought it was that way but it wasn’t They can’t do anything if I don’t become psychotic or such

176029686,"I was always into sports before and after psychotic episodes but as the years passed by i don’t do any sports. Being fit meant a lot to me. I always been to the gym,swim or run, but not anymore. Maybe its the depression coming sometimes with sz."
176029687,"My current pdoc isn’t bad perfect,but he’s the best one I’ve had by a long way… At my last place things were so bad that asking for more help had me branded as ‘awkward,demanding and troublesome’.

I also saw other colours, like a bright reddish gold, a dark red and a vivid neon blue (I started associating that colour with angels, but the others, with demons). I also saw just black melted eye sockets that looked like they were melting down someone’s face. At first I saw all these just when watching TV but then it started happening in real life with people I was talking to, sometimes only one of their eyes would change mid-conversation, but more often two, and it got very confusing because I couldn’t figure out if the person was aware of this or not, or whether it was like some other entity influencing them or something."

Always seek the guidance of your doctor or other qualified health professional with any questions you may have regarding your health or a medical condition. Earth grounding (“earthing”) is an anxiety-busting technique which has you connect a piece of yourself to earth ground, like your bare feet on grass, or an earth grounded clip on your wrist, or in this case, a chain necklace (since it’s closer to your head.) The mechanism of action is supplying your body with a steady stream of electrons, which the body needs to negate free radicals that are the source of the oxidative stress in the body.

Treatment consisted of a daily 30-minute grounding session with an electrode patch

A few hours after wearing the boot, a blister formed, and then developed into a resistant open wound. The patient had undergone various treatments at a specialized wound center with no improvement. Vascular imaging of her lower extremities revealed poor circulation. When first seen, she had a mild limp and was in pain. After an initial 30 minutes of exposure to grounding, the patient reported a noticeable decrease in pain. After 1 week of daily grounding, she said her pain level was about 80% less. At that time, she showed no evidence of a limp. At the end of 2 weeks, she said she was completely pain-free.

176029732,"_AT_MENTION_ Thank you for explaining. I can tell through your posts that you are very bright and very smart! I wasn’t sure what your lifestyle looks like. I understand the hardship of meds not helping. I still talk to my counselor about delusions, associations, and obsessions each week. Also, I always have severe suicidality. I’ve overdosed three times in the last four years from a combination of the suicidal thoughts, obsessions, and delusions. (I become convinced I need to commit suicide so other people can live.) My psychiatrist is suggesting iv ketamine for my depression. I see you often post repetitive thoughts. Do you struggle with obsessions also?"
176029733,"Hi all Just started a new job yesterday Only thing is, I had some symptoms pop up after a long time of being stable (knock on wood!). Had the thought: Can my coworkers read my mind? It only lasted about 30 seconds, but it was enough to make me worried for a bit. Not only worried about whether or not they knew what I was thinking, but also just the fact that I’ve been stable for so long and now this is happening again. Maybe it was first-day jitters, but things are only going to get more hectic as the holiday season approaches, and I’m nervous that my symptoms might pop up with more intensity. What are some things you peeps do to help you battle symptoms in public? Thanks!"

Regardless of personal feelings, exposing minors to sexual content is, legally, very much not ok. Also many sexual topics are not talked about in a recovery/health context. It’s a very unmoderated section of an otherwise very moderated forum. I feel it should be more strictly moderated like posts about drugs, alcohol, and gambling. Cause sex is a hard and uncomfortable topic for many people. It just seems like a weird thing to be like “no cussing but feel free to talk about getting laid” like… It just doesn’t make a lot of sense"

174349381,"Sorry for the long post. I was somewhat normal before taking an edible at the end of my first year of college. Before college, I would never have entertained the thought of using drugs recreationally, mainly because of my religious beliefs. The reasons why I turned to taking the edible was that I felt like a failure for not achieving the goals I had for myself and my own moral failings. 30 minutes after taking the edible, I had one of the greatest trips of my life. It was almost like a religious experience. When I snapped back to reality, my friends said I was acting wild. Next week, I foolishly took an edible a second time and while I took it, I thought my friends were criticizing me but later they said that they did not say anything to me. I found it kind of weird that I apparently hallucinated while on the drug. Fast forward a couple months, I’m at home. My problems aren’t noticeable at first. I consistently wake up at 5 am. I’m working out everyday, running more than 1.5 miles to my gym a
nd lifting weights, doing squats, doing 50+ pushups and 10 pull-ups, then running 1.5 miles back home. I’m energetic. This is all because I planned on joining the ROTC program at my college. I started to get into a manic state. I joined a fringe political party. I started to write a book about my political philosophy. My parents find out that I’m in a fringe political party, and we start to get into fights over it. I then broadcasted my fringe beliefs publicly on social media and in group chats in the worst possible way, isolating myself socially from my (now former) college friends. This was all as my mental state was devolving consistently. My first hospitalization for a psychotic episode happened on my parents’ anniversary. It first felt like when I was smoking weed, then it escalated into hallucinations. The hallucinations were extremely vivid. I became a danger at the hospital because I kicked a nurse. Because I was afraid of a diagnosis, I lied and said I took a drug. I met with a psychiatrist lat
er and because of my fear of a diagnosis of some sort of mental illness, I refused to discuss anything that might suggest I have any problems. My mental illness was progressing. When my mom got me to trust the psychiatrist, I said something that exposed the severity of my illness. Shortly after, the doctor prescribed me haldol. Since I didn’t believe my diagnosis. I refused to take meds which inevitably led to my second hospitalization in a different, more advanced facility. This hospitalization costed me one semester of my sophomore year, meaning that I will have to graduate in December, not May. My second period of psychosis was different in that this time, I lost memory of what happened during parts of the episode. The doctor that was there prescribed me better meds. I now live a normal life, no delusions or hearing voices, and no mood disturbances. Looking back on what happened almost a year after the first episode of psychosis, I keep thinking to myself, what if I didn’t take the edible? Would it at 
least have delayed my schizophrenia? The meds are a crutch to me. I know I am unable to go into ROTC because of all that happened. I don’t even know what type of job I will be able to take on after college. TLDR: I think that taking an edible either caused or accelerated my schizophrenia diagnosis. My life is ruined."

Overexaggerating how perfect everything is in their lives so they don’t get accused of being ungrateful or whatever. There is a lot of shame attached to admitting you need help, and most people need help right now. So to deflect from the shame of needing help, they throw up these shields of how great and perfect their lives are, or get overzealous about specific issues they can use as a scapegoat for their troubles. It is all just people hurting, and not having the skills to ask for real help."

176029864,Your “truths” about COVID seem delusional in nature. It’s real and the amount of new research being released weekly is mind-blowing. It’s a definite threat to the elderly and those with compromised health. Even those with good health will likely come away from an infection with some heart and lung damage even if they were asymptomatic. COVID allowed to get out of control crashes health care systems. People were dying of heart attacks and delayed cancer and heart surgeries in COVID hotspots earlier this year when hospitals were overwhelmed.
176029865,I promised my little brother I’d go to his band concert. We’ll see how that goes. I’m going to my boyfriends after so if all the noise really messes me up then I know he’ll help around me and keep me centered. I’m sure the drive will help. I’m playing my music right now which is nice. _AT_MENTION_ I haven’t actually seen them since 10th grade. Which I think was about 3 years ago. I dont know how to explain them. Just shadow creatures. I haven’t seen them again yet but I’m scared that with the way my emotions are that I’ll see them. My psychotic symptoms are directly related to my emotional stability. Which is why it’s so important for me to manage stress and anxiety. I’d been doing really good too. But i found out this weekend that a really close family friend passed away and I’m not handling it very well.

174349401,I have some issues with sex. Sexual intercourse and oral sex trigger my PTSD sometimes and I can become psychotic. I think about foreplay though and sometimes want to.
174349396,My psychiatrist switched my AP from Zyprexa to Abilify. I’m taking 5mg which Google says is the maximum starting dose. Yesterday I had a hallucination in the laundry room while doing laundry. I don’t think the 5mg is going to work.
176029882,You didn’t say anything inappropriate. You’re just venting and asking for help and sympathy. Absolutely nothing wrong with that; lots of people do it. I think you’re a good person and I don’t think any less of you.
176029883,"I was worried that I was getting hallucinations as I selpt and because I was so anxious I did get them, but by just being told to not worry about it while trying to sleep I felt a lot of relief and now I don’t worry about it at bed time. I sleep just fine now except I tend to sleep in too much."
174349406,when you get on more appropriate doses of anti-psychotics itll get easier to lose weight. you can have all the willpower in the world but on certain drugs its impossible for some people to lose weight much weight. I know I cant lose any MORE. I’m technically overweight but not by much. But its ok if I dont gain anymore. But I can get down to 160 lbs but then I bounce right back up to 165 lbs. Which I have no complaints of. But abilify doesnt let me get down to 155

I didn’t want to quit drinking but Invega _PERSON_ was making me vomit sometimes when I would drink so I decided to quit drinking because of that and to spend my money on other things. I feel better now and I was able to lose a lot of weight from quitting drinking beer.

174349403,"Hello Everyone, I am new to this forum. Having diagnosed with schizophrenia for hearing voices in 2015. Took medication for one year , and stopped for an year(no voices). Later hospitalised in 2017 dec for hallucinations, since then i have been on meds everyday, Risperidone 4mg, trazodone 100mg and lorazepam 2 mg. Recently a week back i stopped my meds and i tried cbd oil, it was good for 2 days as i took 8 mg/d and later i felt uneasy. Now i am back to my meds. Anyone got better results from using supplements or herbal medicines?"
176029910,Mine have reduced greatly over the years. Currently on what is a maintenance dose of Geodon.
176029911,I really like sales. There are industries where you can work mostly from home and don’t have quotas. I like it because I can take down time when I need but commissions pay well. _USER_ID_: no quota means no stress to make a sale.

176029927,"I don’t have first hand OCD, but I have a close relative who has it, and I know how anxiety inducing it can be to have a ritual interrupted or be kept from performing it. Sending you good vibes and strength <3 Kudos for being willing to work on it, even though it can be quite frightening. Like I wrote in the say anything thread the other day, one of the ways OCD affects my loved one is, for an example, that they can’t grab any drink from the fridge if ONE can or bottle is facing the wrong place or not placed parallel to the other ones. As in, they will wake up in the morning, dead thirsty from sleeping meds, and stand in front of the fridge for 15 minutes extending and retracting their arm with tears in their eyes because they just can’t bring themselves to actually touch the drink, but desperately need it. I’ve learned not to interrupt them when they do that, but they have a specific whimpering sound they make which I’ve learned essentially means “I give up, can you please help me befo
re I either puke from anxiety or start bawling?” at which point I will drop everything in my hands, correct the wrongfully placed drink, and get one and open it for them"

It was like the only interest I got were women who were 10 years older than me. Not bad if you were female but seemed that way…Haven’t been back since but that is simply because it gets too hard to explain I’m on a disabilty pension. I’m not adverse to that as the girl I married was 8 years older than me so I’m cool but it just seemed to be par for the course…

174349436,"I have often wondered about how science tells the difference between hallucination and reality…especially about schizophrenia. I recently grappled with some ideas and was gonna make a post as a new topic to discuss with others but this topic is okay too I guess. How many psychologists or psychiatrists have actually experienced schizophrenia? They tell us that we are having delusions. That voice we hear inside our heads is not real but delusional. How do they know if they have not experienced it also? Scientific knowledge about schizophrenia is based on talking with patients about their mental experiences…and defining their experience. But the scientist cannot know the actual mental experience of the patient. The scientist will only know the scientist’s mental experience. Since they have already defined the patient as crazy and they have already defined the patient as delusional, why are they basing what they claim is the definition of schizophrenia on someone they claim is delusional? Delusio
nal means having a belief that is false. It’s like saying “I know what he is saying about his schizophrenia is false but what he is telling me about schizophrenia is the truth” which is an oxymoron! Maybe he can ask “why would he tell me anything but the truth if he wants my help?” This is a valid point. But the scientist’s understanding of a mental truth versus a physical truth can be very different from a schizophrenic’s. Physical truths can be shared by ALL human beings by using communication. Mental truths can be known ONLY by the people experiencing them mentally. We can both know the physical activity of another person if we physically see, hear or feel to share them. We cannot know the mental activity of anyone since we cannot know the mind of anyone except ourselves. We CAN try to share our mental experience to help another understand ours. But this can ONLY be done by physical communication which may not be always adequate for explaining our experience. Especially if the people we are t
rying to explain it to have already defined us as delusional! I know I am schizoaffective. I realized this when I heard my father’s voice in the real physical world telling other people in a hospital how disappointed he was in me. I totally believed it was real when I experienced it at the time but when I told my bro about it a couple days later, he asked me “Do you really believe our father would talk socially like that about you to others?” and I totally realized that it could not be true. But that is the only audio hallucination I have experienced. The other kind of voices are our inside voices — our mental reality of a voice talking to us. We are told that they are not real but delusional. I used the think the voice talking to me was the devil because it was saying horrible things about me to me and horrible things it was going to make me do. I did not experience as ‘my thought’ because it didnt feel like it. It had different ‘tone’ than my own internal voice and when I tried to make it sa
y something while it was talking, it would say something else. So I didnt control it. And in extreme psychosis it could flood my thinking by talking(internally) over me and preventing me from thinking anything. After dealing with ways to handle the experience, I no longer think my voice is the devil speaking to me. I now think it is my negative subconscious. But that does not mean it is not real. Whatever the source(devil, mind, universe etc.) it can take control of my mental reality and make me lose control of mine still. So it is still a very real experience in my mental reality but when I tell my doctor this he tells me I am being delusional. While I am conscious now, this voice cannot control my body and if I have control of my body then I will not harm myself or anyone else in the physical reality. Since my thoughts cannot harm anyone in the physical reality. But I have to really fight to hold on to this concept in my mental reality when I am battling the voice inside my head during psychosis. So it is n
ot JUST a delusion I can ignore."
176029963,My personality was seemingly or practically “empty” when I was 18. I spent 18-28 trying to build a personality I never had. I think candy crystal has more going for them then I did at a young age. But at 19 I was closest to a narcissist if you had to diagnose me with a PD. I think even being an adult is a little young to diagnose someone with a PD. Cuz I don’t think I’m a narcissist and ???? changes a lot at those ages.
174349421,"From what I understand, schizophaffective is when there is mania or depression on top of the psychosis. My psychosis happens independently of depression. My depression happens also independently of psychosis. Meaning I do not have psychosis when I had depression and I do not have depression when I have psychosis."

Cook on high for 4 hours, shred the chicken, add 3 to 4 cans of white beans and return to high for another 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream and tortilla chips. For the complicated way just add a chopped up onion and bell pepper under the chicken. My favorite salsa verde is from Walmart.com it’s tangy and the bottle is large enough.

Having a few probably wouldnt hurt, but drinking to the point of drunk could be bad. I guess it also depends on your definition of drunk. To me drunk is having my mom and dad shower me off at 3 in the morning because I threw up all over myself. Before I quit drinking I would get blackout drunk 3 times a week. Other people’s drunk is getting a buzz. Just be careful, using alcohol to unwind at the end of a stressful week is a gateway to using alcohol to cope with stress in the middle of the week. Some people dont get that bad, but I did so I just like to warn people. I dont judge anyone who uses alcohol, I just like to spread awareness of its dangers."

Its available pregnancy safety data remain limited, which presents a challenge for clinicians managing women of reproductive age on clozapine. We retrospectively studied a consecutive case series of nine pregnancies where there was clozapine exposure. Our case series demonstrates that pregnant women on clozapine treatment can remain stable psychiatrically, but are vulnerable obstetrically, with high rates of obesity and gestational diabetes. Their babies also have poor neonatal adjustment, often requiring neonatal resuscitation. Furthermore, we report on clozapine-related side effects, changes in clozapine levels during pregnancy as well as variation in foetal wellbeing 
monitoring. These findings have implications for pregnancy care for women taking clozapine and require further exploration."

174349455,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and schizophrenia: A nationwide cohort study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and AD _PERSON_, Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV , Oct 2019 06 Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating, dermatological disease that causes substantial psychosocial impediments with increased suicidal risk. Yet data on psychiatric comorbidity in HS has not been sufficiently elucidated in population-based studies. The current study sought to investigate the association between HS and schizophrenia, a major psychiatric disease, in a nationwide population-based study in Israel.Data mining was performed on the database of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest managed healthcare company in Israel. Patients diagnosed with HS (n = 4,191) were examined and compared to age and sex matched controls (n = 20,941). The association between HS and schizophrenia was assessed via multivariate binary logistic regression, adjusting for demographic f
actors and smoking status.The analysis revealed a tenfold increase in the prevalence of schizophrenia in HS patients compared to controls (1.4% and 0.4% respectively, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HS was found to be associated with schizophrenia (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01-2.07, p<0.05).Hidradenitis suppurativa is associated with schizophrenia. Screening for severe mental illness during the assessment of patients with HS is of great importance, as comorbid psychiatric disorders may affect treatment outcomes."
176030104,"I was talking with my father and he wouldn’t explain what he meant by something he said. And all he came up with is “sorry, I’m confused.” He’s either not real, making fun of me, or becoming a bit off with age. But I’m me and can’t tell…Did he die already? Because I can recall a memory of my brother saying he died in a plane crash. but that felt like a dream, not reality… IDK."

176030109,"Thank you _AT_MENTION_ , such kind words. The things that I’m struggling with at the moment have less to do with psychosis and more to do with the OCD that I thought I didn’t have, lol. I have really bad moral scrupulosity, or, to put it simply, a guilt complex."

176030116,"I try to live right, but I just feel that after 8 years of having this diagnosis, my life has not come back to me. Even before I had full time Sz, I was struggling to be a good member of my local community. I have been exploring trying to get hobbies and interests with the psychologist to try and get me out more, but I lack motivation and end up not following through with our discussions. It makes me depressed, and if I am honest, I would like to improve my quality of life rather than letting it continue to spiral. I just don’t know what the answer is."
176030117,Maybe he’s a borderline
176030118,"It happens to me every day. I don’t know why I get so surprised when people treat me good, I try to treat people with respect so I shouldn’t be surprised to get it in return. Maybe my friends in high school screwed me up more than I thought. But yeah, I’m lucky to work around some very decent people, it keeps my faith in people strong."
176030119,i have full insight and im talking normally in my opinion
176030120,"Yeah, a lot of people get hung up on physical appearance. It’s not all guys, some women do it, too, but overall it seems to be more of a guy thing. Every woman has something about her that is beautiful; some guys just don’t get that, and apparently are unable to look past a woman’s imperfections to see the beauty underneath. This is off-topic, but when did you change your name? _PERSON_ reminds me of my days living in the upper peninsula of Michigan, which is heavily Scandanavian (especially Finnish/Suomi) in heritage."

The separation occured in 1978 during my 7-8 month stay in psych hospital ."
176030125,Oh. 6 months is a long time. I’d bring it up with your doctor. You may need to switch meds. If you can take oral meds then rexulti is very similar to abilify.

176030136,"So a day on 225mgs of effexor from 300 a day. Not too bad. Went out to a friends for a catch up early and had a bit of a nap because I was feeling a little odd but survived. No real stress which is always the leveler but I’m pretty confident. Will try to do more tomorrow and put myself under some stress. Long ways to go. Hoping to get to 150 but will do it slow. Effexor really has a beotch of a withdrawal an wasn’t expecting smooth sailing but wasn’t as bad as missing a dose which happens sometimes. Peace, love and chocolate biscuits."
176030137,"_AT_MENTION_ , there’s no real right or wrong way to work on a DP. I’ve tried starting in all different places now. I find for bigger ones its best to start from the top left and work down (I’m right handed). If there is glue around the outside of the painting you can put normal sticky tape over it (this will keep it clean), and also tape it to the table so it doesn’t slip down. _AT_MENTION_ , did you finish the first one you were working on? I like your puppy PS - if you drop them onto the floor a stocking over your vacuum cleaner is meant to do the trick."

Does anybody understand or experienced something similar?"

I figure I need to be independent first before thinking about a partner and even then I don’t think its possible as I stay in bed most of the time, I would make the partner depressed and sad.

Do you still have to hide in silence from the others? I guess it’s still the road to recovery, not being scared of some temporary paranoias mostly I guess?.. I felt lightheaded with them now, but it will get better in a few I guess… Did you had to accept some symptoms despite the meds? Maybe I am still not used that I am a paranoid sz lol…"
174349486,"Thanks again _AT_MENTION_ . Just ordered a months supply. One thing I hated about Clozapine was it gave me really intense dreams, and I haven’t dreamed in years."

174349489,My mum does not accept my diagnosis of schizophrenia. She thinks I have Aspergers and nothing else despite me telling her of symptoms I’ve had etc And despite that over seven psychiatrists have diagnosed me as schizophrenic. I feel she sometimes has expected to much from me. More than I can do. She is in denial and refuses to accept it. I have done things against my will sometimes just because she told me to just to keep the peace. When I applied for pension first time she would not let me write schizophrenia and they rejected til I applied again as a schizophrenic. She made me leave my disability employment agency because they had links to my dr who had diagnosed me schizophrenic and she wanted me registered as Aspergers instead.

174349501,"Cognitive dysfunction is a core and defining characteristic of schizophrenia ( 1 ). Countless cross-sectional studies, including in large population-based samples, have shown that IQ is lower in patients with schizophrenia, and lower than would be expected on the basis of the educational attainment of their mothers ( 2 ) and close relatives ( 3 ). The intellectual underperformance precedes the onset of psychosis by a decade (e.g., 4 ), with more recent longitudinal birth cohort data showing that the decline in IQ is progressive and starts in adolescence ( 5 ) if not earlier ( 6 ). Surprisingly, despite much more data being available, what happens after illness onset is less clear. Cross-sectional data provide a hint: IQ in schizophrenia patients is two standard deviations lower than that of healthy subjects in samples where IQ is assessed (many years) after illness onset, whereas it is only 0.5 standard deviations lower prior to diagnosis ( 7 ). Thus, one would expect IQ to continue to decline afte
r psychosis onset. However, despite this large disparity in IQ deficits before and after psychosis onset, the cross-sectional data have not been confirmed in longitudinal studies (follow-up studies are needed in view of the confounders inherent to cross-sectional designs, such as cohort effects). This is not due to lack of trying: dozens of such studies have been done. https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp._PHONE_NO_"

I’ve transitioned into more of a caregiver role, mostly with technical stuff and making repairs around the house. My concern is if I were to move, my parents will feel lonely given the less than flattering discourse I’ve observed. I wouldn’t move far, 25 miles away at the most. I’m financially stable and will work part-time (once quarantine lets up) and receive disability income. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? How did it turn out?"

176030262,"When I was actively psychotic I had tactile hallucinations that were reminiscent of molestation/rape and became extremely paranoid that I had been abused as a child and these were flashbacks. Even when I was no longer psychotic I believed this must be true for a long time because I never had my symptoms properly explained to me they just gave me medication and told me that I didn’t have to worry about things that weren’t real if I ever tried to bring any of my past delusions up. Now years later I’m starting to properly recover and I think it would be helpful to talk about it to a therapist but I’m really scared they will think I was actually raped or something even though I know I definitely wasn’t (I never had any proper memories just sensations, the details about what I was worried had happened changed frequently because they had no basis in reality).

If we are lucky (?) the results will be an improvement. Perhaps it matters what your motivation is and if you are ethical. You might form a team with experts to think through possible ramifications I am a little unclear why it is important to factorize. That appears to be just grouping with parentheses. #5 says to solve the example, but it is not an equation. Perhaps if you are really smart you will find some results. It looks promising to me.

I don’t do voices. Rarely if ever although I used to hallucinate music. Still. I have/had a central voice/thought that commented on everything I did. Yes I went psychotic but it wasn’t traditional sz till I was dxed. Positive symptoms are just that. You don’t have to be psychotic to hear voices."
176030377,"I just downloaded the DSM 5 and it specifies when it refers to prevalence in clinical samples. When not specified the numbers refer to the general population. Take this sentence, for instance: “Hoarding disorder affects both males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater prevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly female.” Clearly, when not specified, “prevalence” means “prevalence in the general population”, which is also the standard meaning of prevalence in everything else I’ve read. If you search for “clinical sample” it will become clear to you. There are also many, many more mentions of prevalences in specifically the general population than there are of prevalences in clinical samples. Also, it seems lifetime prevalences of any mental illness are mostly somewhere between 25% and 50%. If loss of function is specified as a requirement for the diagnosis, then the criteria are not met if there 
is no loss of function."
174349536,"Years before my diagnosis I underwent an experience which bears striking similarity to one recalled by _PERSON_ in her book “The Center Cannot Hold”. I was minding my own business as usual when suddenly, completely out of the blue, my sense of “I”, my subjective centre (or “minimal self”), appeared to dissolve completely, leaving me literally paralysed, unable to move. I was no longer “I” and became for a few minutes a “it”. It was a terrifying experience and I had no inkling then that it might be linked to sz. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the context of sz? Could you expand on this relationship between ego death and schizophrenia?"

176030445,in my experience a round about approach to removing the belief causing the “voice” which I really think is your own thoughts “filtered” by a belief. like if you heard a thought and believed it was aliens and than it sounded more like aliens than less like you I think thats how “voices” happens. so whatever the belief is making the voices “sound” not like you remove the belief and see if underneath the belief you assigned to the thought its a more relatable own thought.

176030468,"Are you talking to anyone professionally? For me the meds didn’t help as much as the ‘self care’. First… find things that inspire good, positive, love feelings in you. Music, feel good movies, playing with pets or kids, watching a motivational speaker, making a list of all the stuff your thankful for, or all the stuff you like about yourself. Your _NAME_ has much to do with what you consume - both food and media. I did (and still do ) these 4 things every day and it turned it around for me; I became very thankful, the more you are the more good you notice. I gave thanks on even my darkest days. I stopped being a victim, if the voices were mean I tried to see if they had a point - was it something I needed to work on, if so how? I learn also to show the angry voice compassion…not to let it getting me to defend myself but to see if I could heal it and me. (for me this lead to me figuring out that it didn’t work to argue with the people in my life either, to always work towards the goal of 
healing in arguments). Sometimes like with actual people the anger is OR isn’t about you. Do something healthy. (or few ‘somethings’) make a playlist and go for a walk, cook a healthy meal, do something that you know you need to but have been avoiding etc Youtube something motivational, tons of free great talks (I like to do this while cleaning or laundry to feel like it’s already moving in my system). Your not alone, it gets better - I know it feels so hard at times. Just know that although you have bad voices in your head you have good voices that know you can get through this even stronger than before. Take it day by day and every night calmly be thankful that your clearer today than yesterday…even if you don’t really notice it at first I promise you that it works."

176030475,That’s why I take naltrexone. Not because I’m an sza alcoholic who’s gonna die of liver disease if I don’t stop drinking. But because I hated feeling trapped in feeling like I needed to drink. There are different meds u can try that help you stop drinking. Seriously that’s the only way I ever got out of my head. Was taking naltrexone every day along with my other meds. But if u have an addict mind/craving at all that it’s hard to stop well that’s my best recommendation. U can ask your doctor about it or give it a thought.

176030482,"A big theme in my delusion is hearing people trapped in purgatory, or that I myself am in purgatory. It’s not easy to live with day in and day out. I’ve been in this single delusion for months. It helps to keep telling myself it isn’t true, no matter what I hear or see. No matter how hard it gets, there’s usually some little thing or another, such as meditation, prayer, or asking for help, that I can do to stay grounded."

So youre very well versed in the ideas of time travel? I mostly learn about it so i can one day write some scifi stuff about time travel and be able to explain how its done instead of just “magic”.

176030499,"Thanks guys. It’s so strange to me, because there’s no way that so many people are doing it on purpose, you know? It’s not like I’m being bullied. People just sort of tell themselves that I have other friends so that they don’t feel so guilty about not caring about me. No one asks how I’m doing, no one wishes me happy birthday, no one contacts me first unless they want something. People will literally ignore me for months and then randomly text me to ask if they can use my fûcking Netflix. And look, I’ll be the first one to admit that I often help people in part because the guilt that I’ll feel for not helping is so much greater than the guilt I’ll feel for helping without being completely selfless, but you could say that my conscience has a few holes in it. I used to think it made me a bad person, led to me trying to force myself to feel some sort of remorse, but now, I see that it protects me from being readily duped. It was my clarinet, I sounded good on it, and I wanted to pl
ay it. That didn’t make me feel guilty then, and it doesn’t make me feel guilty now, but you know what? I still allowed people to use it, not out of obligation, but out of love. And that? That is what hurts me the most. I gave them my love. The funny, the determined, and the gracious, the racist, the misogynistic, and the jealous. I gave all of them my unguarded, unadulterated love, and they just used it when it benefited them, and then threw it back in my face when they were done, as if my devotion were a cloth to be soiled, washed, and reused. It’s just so frustrating and unfair, not to mention generally unwise, on their part. Don’t be a goddamn dick to the guy who’s making your food."

Everyone of you have talking about the schizophrenia as a group of symptoms “positive,negative and cognitive…etc” -nothing else This is fatal mistake from all aspects and leads to wrong understanding for anything related the schizophrenia For example, when you said “sz does not function only during waking hours” This statement is contrary to the data of sz’s nature ,and it is so easy to prove ! simply, put the symptoms (positive,negative and cognitive ) instead of the word “schizophrenia” in the above statement ,and you will see the result ! The positive symptoms,negative and cognitive does not function only during waking hours The question: How the details of these symptoms occur while the person in a state of sleep / dream or unconsciousness ? When you said"" my schizophrenia controls my sleeping pattern and produces my dreams "" Put the posi
tive symptoms,negative and cognitive instead of the word “schizophrenia” in the statement ! My positive symptoms,negative and cognitive control my sleeping pattern and produce my dreams ! The reality, the effectiveness of positive symptoms,negative and cognitive control (disordering) my will,attention and behavioral responses during the wakefulness period time and therefore it preventing both of the sleeping or dreaming ! When you said "" I have heard voices in my dreams many time"" If you hear the voice you will lose the ability to follow the dream events and you will wake up to inter the world of mindfulness ,because the heard voice is spoken transmitter causing the wakefulness and attention !"
176030509,Pronoia isn’t a problem until you start doubting it. But the reason for that doubt probably exists because of some prior experience of feeling like you trusted too much. It’s better than paranoia but it pretty much requires you to let go and move on from any potential upset that arises to keep working. I had it for a while too. But its the internal thoughts that make you feel like you aren’t deserving of good things that cuts it off. And that begs the question of why would any think that of themselves?..

176030549,"Is your mind made up that you are going to ask for sure, in some way? If you know the nurse well and she knows your diagnosis and she is understanding and sympathetic to your disease I would ask the question and let them know you’re serious but at the same I would make a joke about it or use a little humor to smooth out any awkwardness. Because checking for a microchip is probably not a request they hear often. If you have not known the nurse very long or you do not know her well it might be a little different. But I would say something like, "" I have an unusual request and I’m not sure how to ask you but I have this weird idea that I have a microchip implanted under my armpit. Just to ease my mind, could you please humor me and check for one""? still think a little humor would be apt because it would show to her that you are aware that it’s an unusual request and that you see the humor in the request. If the nurse already knows your diagnosis it would be simpler to ask her. You could say, 
One of my symptoms is that I think I have microchip implanted under my arm. I know it sounds weird or funny but to me it is serious and it would be really nice if you could humor me and check just to put my mind at ease.”"

176030568,"The page which gave coincidences with Thabit numbers was about additive prime numbers associated with numbers of words in chapters of Quran. I did not check if data presented at that page are true, they did not mention which surahs contains prime numbers of words. There were 7 different bolded numbers: 23 - additive prime, Thabit number with 321 number as sum of digits (5), number of digits - 2 (a Thabit number also). 11 - additive prime. Thabit number with 321 number as sum of digits (2), number of digits - 2 (a Thabit number also). 797 - additive prime. Although not a Thabit number itself, it has sum of digits which is Thabit prime (23) with Thabit prime as sum of digits (5). Numbers of digits - 3 - additive prime, although not a Thabit number. 10037 - additive prime. Although not a Thabit number itself, it has sum of digits which is Thabit prime (11) with Thabit prime as sum of digits (2). Number of digits is a Thabit number (5). 337 - additive prime. It is not a Thabit number and has sum of dig
its which is a non-additive prime (13) which is not a Thabit number, although it is the sum of 1st and 3rd Thabit numbers ( 2+11 ). Number of digits is 3 - not a 321 number. _PHONE_NO_ - additive prime. It is not a 321 number itself, but it has Thabit prime (47) as the sum of digits, sum of digits of 47 is 11, which is a Thabit prime with a Thabit prime as the sum of digits (2). Number of digits is a Thabit prime (11) with Thabit number as sum of digits (2). 11171 - additive prime. It is not a 321 number itself, but has a Thabit prime (11) as sum of digits. Number of digits - 5 - is a Thabit prime. Let’s look at the number which has not _PERSON_ prime as sum of digits - 337. Two sorts of digits appear in 337 - 3 and 7, their product is 21 . Only one digit appears once in 337 - it is 7 . One digits repeats oneself in 337 - it is 3 . Sum of repeating digits in 337 is 6 (3+3). Product of repeating digits in 337 is 9 (3x3). Product of three digits forming number 337 is 63 , which is divisible by 21 and 7 . Numb
er 63 consists of two digits - 6 and 3 . Sum of digits of 63 is 9 . Product of digits in 63 is 18 , 18 = 3+6+9. Let’s look at two numbers which have not Thabit primes as numbers of digits - 337 and 797. Both numbers have 3 digits. These two numbers together have 6 digits. The only digit which does not repeat oneself in both numbers together is 9 . Sum of digits in these two numbers together is 36 , which is built by 3 and 6 and has sum of digits 9 and product of digits 18 (3+6+9). Arithmetic mean of sums of digits in these both numbers together is 18 ((23+13):2), in sums of numbers together ( 23 and 13 ) one digit repeats oneself - it is 3 and it occurs two times, 3+3 = 6 and 3x3 = 9 , sum of digits other than 3s occurring in these sums is 3 (2+1). The digit which repeats most often in numbers 797 and 337 together is 7 , it appears 3 times and 7+7+7 = 21 . Products of digits in both numbers are divisible by 7 and 21: 7x9x7 = 441 = 21x21 , 3x3x7 = 63 = 21x3 ; larger product is 7 times larger than smaller. Su
m of numbers 797 and 337 is 1134 , which has sum of digits 9 and 3 digits other than 3 (or 6 or 9) which sum is 6 (1+1+4), 1134 has also 4 digits with product of them 12 (1x1x3x4); 1134 = ((2-1)x7)x3x6x9 = 1x7x3x6x9 = 7x3x6x9."

The feeling of recognizing something that is beneficial. Something I’m looking for. But I don’t now what. Sorry, kind of getting off topic here …"

You have to have had a flight review in the last 24 months. Otherwise you have to take a test. I haven’t had a flight review in years Going flying this weekend. Will see how many hours I will need to get a review. Then I will get my drone license. Maybe I should just study for the test. You don’t need a medical to fly drones.

But it sounds like you are fighting and coping in the best way you can. I am close to giving up on work too. The stress is starting to get too unmanageable.

Researchers devised “smart” cells that behave like tiny autonomous robots which may be used to detect damage and disease, and deliver help at just the right time and in just the right amount. Scientists are inventing new tools all the time LOCKR, short for Latching, Orthogonal Cage/Key pRotein. Transformative Biotechnology Lets Scientists Build Biological Circuits That Give Cells Unprecedented Capabilities: From modifying gene expression to cell signaling, dynamic designer proteins may usher in a new era of synthetic biology. “In the same way that integrated circuits enabled the explosion of the computer chip industry, these versatile and dynamic biological switches could soon unlock precise control over the behavior of living cells and, ultimately, our health.” Companion papers published July 24 in the journal Natu
re describe _PERSON_’s design and demonstrate several practical applications of the technology. The work was conducted by bioengineering teams led by _NAME_ at the UW Medicine Institute for Protein Design and _NAME_ at University of California San _NAME_. The scientists show that LOCKR can be “programmed” to modify gene expression, redirect cellular traffic, degrade specific proteins, and control protein binding interactions. The researchers also use LOCKR to build new biological circuits that behave like autonomous sensors. These circuits detect cues from the cell’s internal or external environment and respond by making changes to the cell. This is akin to the way a thermostat senses ambient temperature and directs a heating or cooling system to shut itself off as soon as a desired temperature is reached. Once assembled by a cell, these new switches measure just eight nanometers on their longest side. More than a hundred million would be needed to cover the period at the end of this sentence. “The

I’ve really got my positive symptoms under tight control, though I still have a lot of OCD and negative symptoms issues.

176030697,"Like I have said before, you have to wean off an antidepressant very slowly. I was on 375 mg of Effexor, and it took me years to wean off it because of the heavy duty side effects I just went down by 75 mg at a time, waited several months to stabilize at the new level and then reduced it by another 75 I hope you’re okay"

Anyway, to make a long story short, I just realized I lost my mind because of a city I lived in, a furniture making capitol. Never knew the constant reference to furniture was what changed me into such a destructive low life person. That fact made me someone close to being criminal, being a cheat, promiscuous, and in and out of hospitals with no idea why. I am paying the price for mentally ill living now and have to really work to give myself any kind of self respect and dignity. But there is hope now as my bent body already feels relief."

But that, to me, should be more in graduate-level courses where the students have already learned the fundamentals and are being trusted to actually teach lower-level courses. If a student is learning how to do a brand new thing, they should be told whether they are doing it correctly."
176030736,"I actually started to take some of those after coming across this thread. Acetyl-l-tyrosine, inositol, leucine, isoleucine, valine (which I’m not certain is related to leucine), and alanine but I’m thinking of not taking that anymore because it makes me tired.

176030743,"I had an in-depth conversation with my boyfriend earlier tonight about my issues which led to my bringing up how I feel stuck in the past and he asked why I don’t pursue that further in therapy - I mused on that for a little bit and reached the conclusion that maybe I’m resistant to change when it comes to transitioning to existing mostly in the present. There’s also the issue of my being somewhat resistant to therapy despite having been helped by it. I’m very stubborn and it took a lot of work to get anywhere in altering my thought patterns by even a smidge. I know there’s hope for my feeling so much better than I do now if I’ll only risk a little temporary discomfort along the way. I don’t want things from years ago occupying 70% of my thoughts anymore. I ended up promising my boyfriend I’d work harder in therapy but man oh man I know I am in for a ride and I can’t exactly say I’m thrilled about that lol. Just had to get this out, I guess.

174349620,"I had to delete all my social media profiles. My sister told me to because she had Googled my name and found my Quora account. So I went onto LinkedIn and contacted them directly about some bizarre accounts I’d set up whereby I’d used a different name and given job experience that simply wasn’t true. I find it difficult coming to terms with the delusions, but believe me it does get better. At least you’ve noticed that they were present, which is key. I used to believe that my watch was bugged by the intelligence services, that the red light in the television was reading my mind and many other delusions or beliefs that simply weren’t true. It’s important to analyse in your mind whether something is factual or not, by looking at the facts that are presented and seeing if it all fits together or not. In many cases it doesn’t and this gives me no surprise when I hear that schizophrenia or the effect of the medication has an impact on intelligence."
176030747,You might need your meds to be changed

176030750,"I’m scared of changing meds, I worry about relapse. I will be hospital free 3 years in march"
176030751,You have to pay somehow and so called free systems like Australia are under great pressure. Long waiting lists for basic services. As _AT_MENTION_ says…it’s not the total answer either. The free market isn’t really free to anyone unless you have some coin. You pretty much can buy your way in with enough coinage.
176030752,I have a tendency to say too much. I’ll get on here every few weeks or so these days… Crank out a few pages worth of text trying to help where I can or otherwise just spill my own beans… talk about things I don’t want to discuss in the real world. Used to post a lot more. Used to be on here every day… but I have more preoccupation in my life these days. Also tired of my own stresses so much… documenting any of it just feels like I’m feeding the beast all the same. Still living for those small breaks… piggy backing on them to find greater appreciation for life and just being alive itself… The best bits are the good vibes people can’t take from ya… Knowing those things and knowing that they are more important to protect and uphold more than anything else one might desire… beyond food and water that is.
176030753,Lunesta and ambien are hypnotics (or whats its called) its not a benzo but similar. Ive read that People get helped by these. Addictions make doctors careful.
176030754,_AT_MENTION_ Please explain what you are meaning by that . _AT_MENTION_ I hope the assessment goes well.
176030755,I’ve never been able to forget trauma and most of it occurred 35 years ago. But with therapy it can help lessen the impact. PTSD unfortunately just doesn’t go away. Don’t be afraid to go out and do what you need to do. Trust me there are other people out there who feel just like you do. The anxiety will get better if you force yourself to do what is causing the anxiety.

176030758,I drink half a pot in the morning and then I make another half a pot in the evening around six pm…I stay up late so I need the boost at night…I take trazadone as a sleep aid or I couldn’t probably ever go to sleep however. _USER_ID_…to answer the question yes it helps me concentrate…
174349617,"I honestly think if I quit the drinks (one therapist said it could be a ingredient inside like an allergic reaction) I would have less symptoms or delusions or thought disorder and mood swings and hence look more bipolar and less schizophrenia. Just a thought and theory I guess. But I would feel weird inside. I always thought or suspected I had ADHD and the drinks relax me and give me uplifted mood and energy sometimes. It gets me out of the house too, but then it costs all my money. It’s become a problem. I’m hoping my new puppy/dog can help me with therapy and anxiety and get my attention off the drinks once and for all."

If you don’t treat yourself, you’ll start feeling sorry for yourself and that won’t help you or your situation."

176030765,"Right now I’m pissed and depressed about what my living situation has degenerated into. I am oblivious to certain things my neighbors do but I came home tonight and walked into my room and heard the neighbor lady laughing next door as usual. Laughing at someone is disrespectful but I was shocked when I stopped and listened harder than usual at the level it had gotten to. Her laugh was so rude and disrespectful. I don’t know who she thinks I am but whoever she thinks she’s laughing at is not me. I haven’t been disrespected like that since I was the shy 12 year old, not too good looking kid who couldn’t stick up for himself to his friends. I’ve come too far to go back to that, She has to learn respect. Probably 90% of the problem is I’ve been too nice and polite to these people and if they sense even one second or inch of weakness they latch onto it and take the proverbial mile. You just can’t be nice to some people."
176030766,I lifted my arms up and down seven times And stood up for two minutes straight!
176030767,I thought about weird crap like clones or people in vats communicating with me telepathically or inserting thoughts into my head. Like imagine a world renowned physicist telling me ideas or concerns and stuff periodically while I sleep or while I’m awake. Giving me knowledge or even harassing me lol. I’ve thought about this early on and I guess I still do rarely if ever. My problem is I feel these ideas or whatever are suppressed from me or the general public now. It makes me feel really paranoid about life. I’m sure they made an X-Files episode about this phenomenon or even a movie.

176030792,School was great. Always had friends and from 16 on that’s where all the women were. I was a late bloomer. I was in a fraternity in college. We had a blast. Of course I wasn’t sick yet. I got married my last year of college too and had a family. That’s where life began.
176030793,I always had problems with study from mid teens. I was promising early in junior but I it all went to shite during my senior. I got to uni and failed that miserably. With that in mind. I wasn’t diagnosed yet. I had issues with paranoia and didn’t even know that was the problem. I also had a depressive break that made me leave uni. I got back in but that really didn’t help… It’s not a bad thing to stop. Get stronger mentally and move from there. I know that is hard to do. You have these plans and that is good but taking the time to get meds right can help too. If your not on welfare what about a shitty job? I always found simple repetitive work to be beneficial. Pays ok with some jobs and probably not the time nor place with this complex world at the moment… Just another perspective…

176030801,I know our relationship is true Because no one else will do Since no one else will put up with me That’s how it has to be I love and hate you beyond mention As I slowly approach dementia You are there as often as you can be Although I wish of you I could be more free And I wish too That free could be The cost of the meds In order to deal with you I remember how we pretended so many things in our youth That was so disconnected to the truth Forever yours I’ll be Although I’ll always dream of being just me
176030802,I hear a lot of voices but mainly from my alters. When one of them is mean to me though I try to counter act it with something nice about myself.

I ask rabbis, priests, friends, forum members, and they all tell me the same thing, that it’s not real.I presume if I went to a conspiracy site they might say it was true, but that’s to be expected. I never had government agents ever directly approach me, even though I thought I was going to be kidnapped to be tortured about 2 years ago. Nothing happened though, so who knows if it was just all in my head? Still, I feel sort of bad for not doing anything about it."

Also its found most hypothyroid people have sub optimal values of vitamin d and b12 so get that checked too as without correcting these thyroid issues won’t resolve by levothyroxine alone.

People aren’t being judgmental when they demand equal respect and adherence to social etiquette. If you know you have violent tendencies, it is your responsibility to seek professional medical help, so you do not hurt others. You are responsible for your own actions at all times. On here, as with other mental health sites, we do not allow mental illness to be used as an excuse for poor behavior. We all have mental illness here, and we all are held to the same expectations regardless. If you feel like you aren’t in control when you hurt others, you NEED to be on medication and under the care of a professional, so you can regain the self-control needed to stop hurting people. If you can’t do that, you need to be put in a safe place where you can’t hurt others. That’s just how it is."

176031020,"I’ve experienced something similar in my travels. Antidepressants are the most nefarious offenders for me. I get this electrical zapping feeling in my spine that is only relieved by contorting suddenly, and it’s always at bedtime. Some folks have called them “brain zaps” and that’s probably close to what I experience. I’ve never abused benzos (for this reason), so I can’t attest to that. Coming off AP’s is okay as long as I switch from one directly to the other. Some of the second-gen ones really screw with me, so I take a first-gen med and it works great. Of course, coming off them throws my cheese off my cracker, so there’s that. 0/10. Would not recommend."

176031027,"Saw this last night and wanted to post. I think your sister is being over protective of you. But there are probably good intentions behind her actions, and I think you need to open dialogue with her and try and find a balance. My understanding from what you wrote is she probably does take really good care of you, but perhaps you are finding some aspects a bit invasive. I think deleting contacts from your phone and deleting your FB account aren’t acceptable behaviours from someone engaging in a parental/care giver role. A better action would have been to inform you that she doesn’t think those people have you interests at heart and to encourage you to limit your contact with them. I just don’t think its healthy for her to make those decisions on your behalf and act them out, even if she is doing it for good reason. Similarly, I think some spending/shopping is acceptable. But of course only to a reasonable amount. Some people do lose sight of their spending and go over board and thats probably 
what shes worried about. Not sure if thats happening here, but a middle ground where you have a certain amount a month that you are allowed to spend seems much fairer than zero. The way I think you should approach this is try and open dialogue. Don’t get angry or pissy. Try to use “I” statements. “When you do this, I feel __”. I think your sister sounds like a really solid family member and is trying really hard to support you but maybe some of the smaller details could be altered."

In the end I thought what if I should become like this? After all, I don’t know if it’s better to have your head clear of thoughts or to have them, because in the first case I’m afraid of becoming stupid, if I’m in the second case I usually think about things that make me feel bad such as obsessions or involuntarily block the thought (this is my impression) causing me headaches sometimes stronger sometimes less severe"

176031094,I have been on many medications and it’s always the side effects that have caused me to switch. The best meds for me have been Latuda and Amisulpride for side effects. Don’t worry too much. You may have to try a few before you find one that works for you

176031101,But _AT_MENTION_ is obsessed with locking my threads. Why?

I do use modafinil (a stimulant) and I do smoke cigarettes (nicotine being the stimulant) but otherwise I do not even drink."

176031115,I decided to go off of my invega shot and start cbd oil daily So far it’s working great. I’m still having a few rough spots due to weaning off of klonopin which causes my symptoms to flare up But I’ve been about 60 days since my last shot that I was usually getting every 3 weeks at the highest dose with symptoms still. Especially at night. I’ve seen people who have tried cbd and failed but most cbd isn’t quality cbd. You have to go with a good company I’m down to .75mg klonopin at 6 pm for now will keep you updated once I’m fully weaned off. Have an appt to check my invega levels the 20th because I’ve read conflicting reports of how long it takes for it to leave your system. 28 to 45 days is what I found but you can’t be too sure Just wanted to share I also started drinking matcha and taking l theanine supplements a few months ago which helps a lot too

176031117,"The only time I have ever had command hallucinations I was heavily medicated on anti-psychotics. So what does that say about it? The only medication that works for me goes against the dopamine hypothesis. I take Abilify which is a dopamine agonist. That’s the complete opposite of Seroquel which blocks dopamine. And Geodon and Risperdal were medications that made me hallucinate. They caused epileptic seizures and induced hallucinations. So I don’t know if schizophrenia even exists? Or if its a condition that’s being created by the pill companies. Truth / facts do matter don’t they? I mean even if _PERSON_ had me under surveillance and I was being unfairly targeted because they think I’m delusional, I made some points. I am 100 percent aware that I am psychic. I find out secret information easily. That’s why I’ve been targeted my whole life. I’m also the bloodline of _NAME_ Magdelene. Do I believe these things because I have schizophrenia? Why can’t I just erase my experiences? If I 
erased them would I no longer believe that I was haunted my a spectre ghost that I recently exorcised from my house? I never talk about my thoughts because people just will say I’m crazy. I know they’re called fixed delusions but I can’t fix them. I know that there was a ghost and it really bothers me. I can’t forget all that paranormal stuff neither can I explain it. The AI the vortex the electrical glitches and bi-location. I keep thinking it was either a psiop or alien abduction or I was the victim of a cult ritual at boarding school. They erased two days from me, there’s two days I don’t remember but I know I had two flashbacks: a party drinking beer, a boy and the empty room we’re sitting in the back and no one is around, screaming, the bullies… the red streak in the sky The teacher saying aliens had visited the school The knocking from inside the closet and the sleeping pills my roommate gave me. Why can’t anyone ever help or even hear me when I bring it up? They always forget I even s
aid it. It’s like I was under spiritual attack. I can’t explain anything, and just because reality gets messed up is not a precursor to violence."

Its 2nd most effective antipsychotic after clozapine in removing delusions. Plus Solian will not help you with cognition in terms of what you just said like memory. Solian is mostly given for positive and negative symptoms and not for cognitive symptoms. For cognition you can try other antipsychotics like risperidone(will cause sexual dysfunction), abilify, olanzapine, clozapine etc You can talk to your pdoc about finding which dose works best for u on Solian."

I dated a lady many years ago who never had grocery or rent money because she gambled it at bingo and on lottery tickets trying to get more money. Bumped into her a couple of years ago and she hasn’t changed, except that she looks like she’s in her late sixties despite being in her late forties (too much booze and cigs). Her kids have cut her off because she’s useless. First thing she did was ask me for money. If nothing changes, nothing changes."

I can’t say if they were good or not but I was awake for 2 days for the person I brought them off, I managed to get some sleep last night. I missed my depot on the morning I took the pills as the depot nurses lost my medicine card. I took the pills in the afternoon Now I feel all jittery, focused on thinking the staff are laughing about me. I have been thinking the depot nurses set me up. I have been obsessing about all this a lot. I have been crying reading animal adoption stories on Quora… I don’t feel right at all.

I am curious to see the prevalence here. Sorry if I mess the poll up the first time, I usually do just give me a minute and I’ll figure it out.

Special needs trusts mostly mean the person called the trustee is not supposed to allow the beneficiary any money that will stop them from getting help from the government, like in the USA mostly medicaid, supplemental social security income.

Don’t get me wrong - take your meds , go to your therapy…do all you can to help yourself through this but maybe this mental execise can help. But what helped me with the heart thing was internal work, forgiving myself & others for past pain and understanding the lesson in the past hurt - so I wouldn’t have to keep learning it. Also (good thoughts, good words & good actions) go along way in healing - it takes awhile to reboot the brain but it’s completley so much better living in that head space than one of fear and pain. So self correct…daily, it makes a difference. When it got bad I would find things to be grateful for anyway, and then I would find a moment of love/joy in my memories and lay down with my hands over my heart and let that other love memory help heal the current pain.

174349782,"Thank you for posting this. From what I understand, gene expression is a series of codes on how genes work. So if we have a mutation, the gene is not fully expressed. For example: let’s say our gene says (borrowed from a geneticist’s videos) “THE CAT SAW THE RAT BUT NOT THE BAT OUT ” (OUT is the end of the gene code) is the correct sentence, and then something goes on, causing my cell to read (in case of a missense mutation) “The CAT SAW THE RAT OUT NOT THE BAT OUT ” which causes the gene to stop reading the code after ‘rat’ and just ignores the rest of the sentence. I honestly don’t know how it is related to rhythms but it must be related to how our genes work during the day and night."

176031353,"Well, it is your subcconscious telling you that in some form. Possibly because you now self identify as a sz, a lot of mental baggage comes with that such as what you thought szs thought before you got ill, or what society told you to believe szs thought more like. Thus, what your subsconscious is telling you is ingrained beliefs of what you previously presumed szs thought and did. If you truly believed deep down that schizophrenics weren’t dangerous then that subconscious voice would change. I am not a psychiatrist, but just my two cents."

176031421,"Hi I’ve been diagnosed with somataform disorder, I have severe physical symptoms that affect most everything in my daily life. Does anyone relate to having severe depression and anxiety along with the somatics? I am clumsy and awkward and have severe pains in my arms and legs. I have confusion and sometimes feel I am disoriented. Doing things is very difficult. I have zero energy and sleep a lot, that’s my depression I think. I’m taking zyprexa. Its definitely starting to motivate me, but I find doing things still is very hard! I’m only taking zyprexa over a week, so it will take more time to work I imagine. Honestly somataform disorder is very debilitating and stressful. I was thinking for years I have MS, still there are days I think I have MS. I know one other person with somatic symptoms and they too suffer daily. My psychiatrist once told me I perhaps have a delusional disorder as well due to I believing I have MS. At the moment, my psychiatrist says I have treatment resistant depressi
on which is difficult to find the right combination of meds to treat it. I worry about this because I hate being depressed and the sadness it brings with it is just crippling as well. I’m on a lot of meds, so am hoping together they will release me from my symptoms soon. I have a bit more motivation but I’m still not knowing where to start , that awful confused clumsy state I am in, plus I’ve lived a sedentary lifestyle for three years now and have gained weight so am definitely slower as well. I have to do more to help myself my psychiatrist told me. Excersing, eating properly, my diet is bad, I tend to eat as I go, and dont enjoy eating. Have to look after my self care better as well. Theres no quick fix my psychiatrist told me. I’m also going to see a clinical psychologist soon to talk about my past and ways to help going forwards. This whole mixed up situation for me is just so difficult. Somataform disorder is quiet common my pdoc told me. I remain hopeful I’ll get there eventually:) it’s goi

I am 36 and my doctor always uses the fact that it is statistically less likely at my age as a reason it is psychotic depression.

176031465,I’ve been stable for like…6 months I think? I have a bit of paranoia and delusions but my doctor thinks it is stemming from CPTSD. So I stopped my antipsychotic with the discretion of my doctor. We’re still tracking our prognosis.
176031466,"Ya I can’t really verify what is a delusion and what is truth completely but I just sorta take it easier and am less adamant about insisting my beliefs are correct. I still talk about weird things occasionally but mainly focus on doing real world stuff like art and music and…normal life stuff. But at my core I guess there’s something unusual. Not all of my delusions have been disproven and part of me believes I’ll be proven correct in the afterlife, but the majority of me just wants to enjoy my time on Earth quietly. But I think schiz is not a weakness. A disability yes but even the term seems ableist, I prefer to call it a condition."

Additional challenges include non-adherence and adverse effects, especially cardiometabolic dysregulation. This review evaluates new/emerging pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia. Therapies targeting total symptoms include cannabidiol, D3 antagonist/5-HT1A partial agonist F17464, lumateperone (ITI-007), phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors MK-8189 and TAK-063, sodium nitroprusside, and trace amine-associated receptor-1 (TAAR1) agonist RO5263397 and SEP-363856. Treatments targeting negative symptoms include the PDE10A inhibitor LuAF-1
1167, 5-HT2A inverse agonist pimavanserin, sigma-2/5-HT2A antagonist roluperidone (MIN-101), and d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor TAK-831. Agents targeting primarily cognitive dysfunction are the glycine transporter-1 inhibitor BI-425809 and cannabidiol. Therapies targeting residual positive symptoms/treatment-resistant schizophrenia include pimavanserin, dopamine D1/D2 antagonist LuAF-35700, and DAAO inhibitor sodium benzoate. Two new long-acting injectable antipsychotic formulations, Aripiprazole Lauroxil NanoCrystal® and the first subcutaneous injectable LAI Perseris (RBP-7000), were recently approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and positive results were announced for Risperidone ISM®, each achieving therapeutic levels within 24 hours, without need for initial oral cotreatment/loading injection-strategies. Paliperidone palmitate 6-monthly intramuscularly injectable and Risperidone subcutaneously injectable TV46000 are currently under investigation. Finally, the samidorphan+olanzapine combi
nation targets reduced weight gain liability, while maintaining olanzapine's efficacy. Most of these trial programs are still ongoing or have yielded mixed or even negative results. Thus, additional mechanisms of action and agents require study to improve schizophrenia outcomes for total/positive symptoms with reduced adverse effects, but also cognitive symptoms, negative symptoms, and treatment resistance, the areas of greatest need in schizophrenia currently."

Let me count them… okay, there were six of them. All great guys! I tended to make friends with other outcasts.

I dress nice and I am polite and friendly and manage to show I am very interested in the job. Once I get an interview I usually get the job. Not a 100% of the time.

My body is having problems too…I’ve developed some bursitis but I still run and try to get better.
176031585,I know what you mean too. I often look to people I respect to get an idea of how I’m doing. I really need that feedback because I can’t always tell how I’m doing. Their answers sometimes surprise me. My sister has been key in finding meds that work. I don’t want to take meds but because of my sister’s feedback I have been able to find meds that have me acting almost like a normal person and better enough to start taking action to better my position in life. Without her feedback I probably would still be going on and off meds due to not wanting to push through the side effects.
176031586,_AT_MENTION_ That is really terrible and I don’t know how I can comfort you but I wish I could.

It just became obvious that my negative symptoms are primary only (schizophrenia only, not the antipsychotic) after trying the above options.

I was also being watched and monitored, and controlled by signals. And hacked, projected into all different forms of media. I had a lot going on and obviously can’t say it all. But yeah, the worst of the delusions continued for about 3 years. I thought I was sane, literally projected good health and was doing better in some ways than I had done in years.

We aimed to examine clozapine response/non-response patterns in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, as well as determine patient clinico-demographic factors associated with long-term clozapine non-response. Clinico-demographic characteristics of 241 patients on clozapine were collected through a retrospective chart review. The median (interquartile range, IQR) follow-up from illness onset was 25.0 (IQR?=?24.0) years. Clozapine response was assessed 
at median 10.8 (IQR?=?14.0) months (Time 1, T1) and 7.2 (IQR?=?13.5) years (Time 2, T2) after its initiation. It was evaluated by chart reviewers based on the information provided in clinical notes. Binomial logistic regression was used to determine clinico-demographic factors associated with clozapine non-response at both T1 and T2 (i.e. stable UTRS, S-UTRS) compared to clozapine response at both times (i.e. stable clozapine responders, S-ClozResp). Among clozapine responders (n?=?122) at T1, 83.6% remained clozapine responsive and 16.4% became non-responsive at T2. In the UTRS group (n?=?119) at T1, 87.4% remained clozapine non-responsive and 12.6% became responsive at T2. Duration of delay in clozapine initiation (OR?=?0.94, Wald ?2?=?5.33, p?=?0.021) and number of pre-clozapine hospitalizations (OR?=?0.95, _PERSON_ ?2?=?5.20, p?=?0.023) were associated with S-UTRS. Most UTRS patients were non-responsive to clozapine from the start of treatment. Preventing delay in initiating clozapine and relapses could h
elp promote long-term clozapine response in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Future longitudinal studies are required to explore the neuropathological correlates of relapses and delay in clozapine initiation."

174349889,I continue to undermine my value despite having a good education and a top-notch overseas experience. My therapist says anyone would trade that for the world and people would be envious of my expertise. This is true because foreign-educated Koreans have more advantage in the job field of anything English. But I don’t know. Why am I so sought after? I don’t get it because I’m just a schizophrenic and a disabled person. No one would want to hire a person on a wheelchair. I’m an embarrassment. I spent like the next hour challenging this idea with the therapist but it’s so fricken hard. My therapist told me that my parents not telling my brother about my sz is not love. It’s rather based on shame. So it’s up to myself to love me. But loving myself is so hard. I just don’t like myself and I don’t find myself loveable. Like I can’t trust myself. I would be perfectly content at tearing out my pictures…so loving myself is difficult but I am willing to try. I’ve been thinking about my 
ex too much lately and I am thinking of my image as a person who can hurt people easily. So I talked to my therapist about it and he said that it’s not black-and-white; my ex may have been content at loving me and experencing love. I don’t necessarily believe him but I will try to think that he found love towards me as a valuable experience. That sums up therapy for today. Goodnight! Next therapy session is on next Wednesday.

Yesterday last night she went and saw some bumblebee movie with her kids at the beach and she showed me pics and said “this is what I’m doing and I’ll prove it to ya with pics”. Then she texted me when she got home after 10 pm. But by now I have a good idea how much I like the woman. Like when I “sleep on the idea of someone” it really gives me a perspective whether I like them or not and I wake up each morning liking her more and more. And she doesn’t avoid any questions she’s honest and real with me. It’s gotta be a matter of time till she makes some real plans. Tomorrow’s a holiday but idk.

When I was 16 my mood swings started (according to my best friend). Then at 18 had my breakdown and started self harming and I was delusional. Thought evil spirits were trying to infiltrate my mind. At 21 I started recovering. And two years later went into remission and came off my meds. At 28 I relapsed and resumed meds. Rediagnosed with sz then sza. Since then been in cycles of relapses and recoveries. Been on meds ever since. I’m now almost 36.

176031806,"Sure. I lived in a Soteria House in San _NAME_, Ca. In 1980 for a year. I was 19 years old. Their main tenet was that they could treat schizophrenics better without hospitalization and without meds. They just set up this two story house in downtown San _NAME_ and took in about 6 or 7 clients at a time. The guys who set it up and ran it staffed it with young counselors who had no formal mental health training. It was interesting but It didn’t help me. It might have helped others but for me I always regretted living there and wished instead that I had been put on meds earlier. I saw a lot of weird stuff there. One thing it had was that there was a lot of freedom there. There were few rules and I could pretty much come and go as I pleased without having to tell the counselors. I guess I was part of psychiatric history. If you’re really interested in it, the two cofounders who ran it wrote a book about it called, “Soteria: From Madness to Deliverence”."

Anyway weaker ones include aripiprazole (abilify), cariprazine (vraylar). These doesn’t block dopamine fully like strong AP but may not be able to reduce all positive symptoms. There are several non medication substances which have some AP properties. For example some users report lione’s mane mushroom help to reduce positive symptoms. Another one is holy basil (tulsi).

I am taking 3 showers a week now and on the treadmill for minimum 5 minutes those days. Slowly we will be upping it to bigger goals eventually hobby type activities but very small scale. It’s a horrible thing to have mental illness but I am hoping this sticks. I am also getting a little help from a med but not good for _PERSON_, it’s giving me some psychotic experience. The mini goals and reward are huge. It’s only going to take me so far but at least it’s forward.

174349917,"Hello. I like your topic. I find myself as well antihistamin helps. I am not sure 100percent of my diagnosis and I am new to this site. Last year I had kind of psychosis when I had racing thoughts, anxiety, panic attacks, I stopped eating, sleeping and I was always telling myself stupid things with my own inner voice. I do not have halucinations, or hear other voices. When I had psychosis I was immediately scared I have schizofrenia and I was scared I could harm other people. I was always scared of mental illnesses in the past. Psychologist did roscharch test and diagnosis was psychosis with signs of schizofrenia. I got rispen 1mg, I could not handle when psychiatrist increased dose in 1 week to 2mg. I stopped medicine and I got bad side effects. I was dizzy, restless for few months. I could not believe I have something to do with schizofrenia and my friends said its rubish as I did not act crazy. I went to 2 other psychiatrists they thought I have depression I got some antidepressants Citalopram i
t helped me with panic attacks and I used Ambien to sleep. I started to be more paranoic scared that other people poisoned my medicine. Citalopram and Ambien made this paranoia worse. Then lucky was when I used l-theanine instead of Ambien. That was great. I visited last psychiatrist I am with her now she took me off Citalopram it made me feel bad. She was observing me for some time and she said I am on border of pychosis many times and I have something to do with schizofrenia,but its not pure schizofrenia maybe something similar to schizoactive that is what I found reading on internet. She suggested I should try neuroleptics Abilify 10mg. I still did not take it I am very scared of it. So far I use only Omega 3, l-theanine, B vitamins, B9 vitamins, I got from neurologist 40mg Gingo Biloba special pills called Tebokan. I as well have 4 types of herbal drops that is from detoxicologist that helped me with that strange thoughts when I was telling myself over and over strange scary stuff. This thoughts decreased 
80 percent, many days I do not have them, but I do feel strange. I have concentration issues. When I had psychosis last year I had problems to read and watch TV now this is much better. I have polen allergy and when I started to take my medication antihistmamin Rupafin 10mg I had huge relieve. Few days I felt happy, gingo biloba pills helped me as well. I felt more energetic and it helps with anxiety. I found as well there was study done in Scandinavia psychiatrists proven antihistamins to be effective for schizofrenia, but so far no farmaceutical company made pills for schizofrenia based on antihistamins. I said it to my psychiatrist she said she knows of this study, but it was just one study and she said I should take antipsychotics. So far I am scared to take antipsychotics based on my bad experience with meds last year, but I need something. I still have racing thoughts, sometimes anxiety, I sleep worse sometimes I wake up in night scared I saw something in my room, I get concentration issues. My moods we
re up and down and I had suicidal thoughts a lot. After taking antihistamins now my moods are better. I mean I do not cry every 2nd day. Still I know I need help, but I am really scared to try Abilify. I am scared it will make me feel restless and my sleep will be worse. I did job recently, now I look for new job. Last year I did not work since my psychosis. I started to work just when I finished meds and used supplements. To be honest I am so scared now how my life changed and I am scared about the future. Since last year I felt my life was ruined. I had good life so far. I am 38years old and now this crazy times. I as well did a lot of sports I still do. Not sure how it will be once I start Abilify. Any ideas ? Here article about antihistamin ScienceDaily New treatment for schizophrenia? Giving a very large dose of famotidine (200 mg daily), sufficient amounts of the drug are able to penetrate the so-called blood-brain barrier to affect the histamine system in the brain."

176031891,"Hi all, Im new to the website and have read through a decent amount of posts in the Unusual Beliefs section. I am posting because I have some issues that I want to talk about on the web before I talk to someone in real life about them. Am I crazy? I may have meditated my way into telepathy or I am not doing well. I heard someone’s thought the first time when I was 21 and am 27 now. The person walked up to me and said hello, but at the same time I heard on the inside “Beer”. In the sense that I basically heard the persons thought and yet we had a normal conversation the whole time. I was deeply spiritual and into meditation and kind of took the whole experience in stride. It didn’t happen very frequently, but at some point the meditative way became deluded. I was buddhist and the experience has lost its “signs” a long time ago. You think of a friend and the person texts you. You read an article, jump into a conversation and someone brings up the topic. Things like this are gone. I just w
onder how close the subconscious is to the surface. I have lost a lot of friends since this started and don’t know where to test whether this is real or not. I am just trying to keep it classy at this point and I’m in no rush to run up to someone in real life talking about telepathy. I went from an extrovert to an introvert. The only time the thought sharing has been confirmed recently was when I was with a girlfriend and I thought “dang I need to pee” and then she actually says “then just go to the bathroom then.” My jaw dropped. What a magical woman. So I basically want to know if this is schizophrenia or am I actually picking up on other people’s thoughts. Some outlandish meditation groups say you run into sticky territory like this and I cant get help from them. I am wondering how much room for magic there is in this area. What are the chances Im schizophrenic or deeply sensitive. Can I actually hear other peoples thoughts?"

174349945,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cognitive and clinical predictors of community functioning across the psychoses. _PERSON_, TR _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PsyCh journalReferences, Mar 24 2020 Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related psychotic illnesses are common, serious mental disorders that are often associated with functional impairments and poor quality of life, even after clinical recovery. Cognitive dysfunction is a strong predictor of functional impairment; however, findings regarding relative impairments in functioning and cognition across diagnoses have been mixed, as have reports of the contribution of clinical symptoms and other illness features to functioning across diagnostic boundaries. We assessed 211 patients with psychotic disorders and 87 healthy controls using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, clinical measures of state mood and psychotic symptoms, and an interview measure of community functioning. Diagnostic groups were compared on MATRICS composite and domain scores, and clinical and fu
nctional measures. We then examined cognitive, clinical, and demographic predictors of community functioning using stepwise hierarchical linear regression. All three patient groups exhibited deficits in most cognitive domains relative to controls, and significantly poorer community functioning. While scores on most cognitive domains did not differ by diagnosis, when groups did differ patients with schizophrenia performed worse than patients with bipolar disorder. Cognition was correlated with functioning across the sample. The final regression model included negative symptoms, mania, social cognition, and processing speed, and explained 47% of the variance in community functioning scores across patient groups. Residual negative symptoms, residual mania, and social cognition significantly and independently predicted community functioning. These findings indicate that, while all cognitive domains are associated with community outcomes, when considered together and with clinical symptoms, negative symptoms, mani
a, and social cognition are the strongest predictors across diagnoses. Development of interventions targeting negative symptoms and social cognition may be effective in improving community functioning for patients across diagnoses."

174349942,"i’m schizoaffective with an anxiety disorder. in the past, i’ve had full blown delusions before where i refused to believe i could be mistaken. a couple times in the past year or two, it felt like i was starting to become delusional but wasn’t quite there… i wasn’t taking my medication at the full dose, and i started thinking i was going to be assassinated if i didn’t quit my job. i had a lot of fear that i was going to become involved in a national scandal and be shot. i almost quit based on that borderline delusion. it felt like i was physically being overtaken by a delusion. in the past, medical settings made me feel like i was being spied on and such. i went to the ER because of a panic attack, and i just started feeling like i was being spied on and such again. this time it wasn’t like i was being physically overtaken, but it was more like a reflex. does this sound like anything you’ve experienced while dealing with psychosis after being in a slow recovery process?"
176031933,I hope you get better in some way. I cant even cut down because I made a tiny cut and was in very bad withdrawl for 2 years! I kept going because I didn’t want to waste the suffering and I hoped it would be over soon.

I have never taken Invega and I have only gotten the shots of Haldol in the psych ward so I have never been on a depot. The 3 week thing sounds like a good idea though. I don’t know if Latuda does anything for my psychosis but it really helps with my mood and negatives. If you have bad negatives Latuda is advertised mostly for bipolar depression but it is an AP.

176032009,"I am not the best person to give you confidence in this. Think it pretty much depends on your social circle, and whether it survived your psychosis. Mine did not. Did date a girl once, but it wasn’t for me. That was after the diagnosis. I live in a town of about c100,000 people, and not one of them wants to date me! Also, don’t get down. Lots of people are pretty spooked by Covid_PERSON_, so not the best of times to meet people. My advice to you would be to try and force yourself into not isolating. I isolated. Think that was one of the main problems. Once you lose all contact with other people, it becomes so hard to meet any one. Not sure on your history, but I had first psychosis 16/17, and from age 11 to 17 I was into drugs. All the nice people in my town I grew up with at school etc think I am a scum bag. Maybe the best thing to do is live in a city. Your chances will go up I am sure. For me, I prefer living on the outer edges. I don’t like noise. Wish you luck, but I cannot give you a ro

And yes, they were going fast. Yeah… It was a thing for my generation. But it’s exactly what it sounds like, and no, it doesn’t get you high. What’s that? How is it benefitting them in any way, you ask? It’s not. It probably just started as some joke and then people started trying it for “that sweet, sweet internet fame.” Yes. There are some people who say that the positive results of the disease are worth all of the suffering, and that they’d never change a thing. I am not one of those people. Not only that, but I doubt that many of those people are truly schizophrenic. I really do fear being a bad person, but if I could make it so that I was a little selfish but never had schizophrenia, then I’d do it in a heartbeat. I’m not a psychopath. I have a conscience. I don’t have to be schizophrenic to stri
ve to become a better person. I would’ve fu cking learned, you know? Schizophrenia didn’t shape my personality. I had this same personality long before I ever experienced psychosis. I’ve been stable (for the first time in nearly 7 years) on my meds from the hospital last November/December. I still have negatives and cognitive symptoms, a few positive symptoms, mostly hallucinations and occasional paranoid ideas that don’t stick around for long."

176032098,Every day. This is not the life I should be living. I should be flying jumbo jets or at least heavy helicopters. Instead I am a tax collector. Nobody wants to hear from me but you still have to count your blessings. At least I am back to work. That took about 12 years. It wasn’t easy. And I am still on probation so I haven’t made it yet. I used to be able to do the impossible and practically anything. I succeeded in everything I did. Since getting sick I have had to learn how to handle failure. That’s not easy either and I fail a lot. And then there’s the medication and having to sleep half the day to stay well. I used to be good to go with 5 hours of sleep. Not now. I would be nuttier than a walnut. And the side effects. I won’t even go there. It’s an accomplishment just to shower or make a meal. And I used to have a social life. Lots of friends and went out partying at least three nights a week I hardly leave the house now. I go to work and go out to eat and get a haircut every other w
eek or so and that’s it. I used to be a fun guy and had a blast. Now I am a bore. I see my friends about 3 times a year instead of going out 3 nights a week. You still have to be thankful for what you do have though. Life is worth living. It’s a struggle but you have to stay in the game. Don’t grieve too much. You can’t really be happy with this illness but you can be content. That’s what I have learned.

The pdoc said that is why my dx is currently psychosis, not sz. I’m just saying this because I hope no one is encouraged by my low dose to go on a low dose themselves without pdoc approval and feeling comfortable about it, especially if you have sz, _PERSON_. Relapsing because of going on a lower dose could be problematic cos it may end up that the person has to go on an even higher dose or breakthrough symptoms persist… Well Idk about that, perhaps not, it depends on what the pdoc says for everyone’s individual case."

176032142,I’d say mine is pretty high. Not perfect but good. It comes from years of needing to judge someone’s mood for fear of being hurt. Now I am learning to set up emotional boundaries (I tend to take on negative emotions from others) and use the skill of empathy to my advantage. It’s like a little bit of insight into how other people see the world. It can be dangerous though because it is easy to make excuses for other people’s poor behavior when you can empathize with them. I am also learning to not let people walk all over me. It’s a tough thing to learn. Doesn’t help that I generally lose my EQ when psychosis is severe or if I am having a panic attack. Sometimes I wish I was oblivious to others’ emotions or that I was better equipped to not let them affect me so deeply.

176032154,"Well, Shoppers Drug _NAME_ said that they would give seniors the 20% discount every morning for the first hour, rather than having discounts only on Thursdays. So, this morning I was there when it opened, and had finished my shopping by 9:15. Big mistake ! If only this 1st hour senior discount actually worked. But, if you use the self-check-out, YOU DON’T GET A SENIOR DISCOUNT. You have to go to a cashier instead. So despite me doing everything possible to keep my distance from other people, and doing so by using the self-check-out, and then obviously using my stylus pen on the self-check-out screen such that I did not have to actually touch the screen, plus having my tap credit card, which does not have to actually touch the machine to actually work, and the visual scanning of my PC Optimum card bar code, I got no 20% discount. WHAT A WAIST OF ISOLATION EFFORT ! Instead, you have to go to the cashier, who has been standing near plenty of customers, and who has handled plenty of goods. Fat lot of 
good that is for the seniors. Here is trio combo I was using this morning. It is composed of my PC Optimum card back to back with my credit card, along with my stylus pen, all held together with elastic bands.

I dunno what they are doing, but you would think these metabolites they are worried about would have turned up in people if they were going to. Metabolites are the byproduct of the body breaking down a drug into a different substance - that starts happening right away when you take a drug, not months later. That doesn’t mean some drugs can’t have long term effects that aren’t recognized til later, but if the ill effect is related to the metabolite, well, you should be able to measure a metabolite right away.

176032181,They’re going to hold it against you that you worked. There are 3 people from social security. The claims examiner the medical examiner and the vocational expert. All 3 are going to evaluate you. The claims examiner has the final say and she/he can over rule the other 2. My doctor is a MD at a hospital and I was seeing him on an out patient basis. I worked for 8 years. My doctor fully supported my decision. The judge called my doctor a liar and said he was being sympathetic to my cause. The judge railed on me and my lawyer did nothing. The vocational expert said I could work if I had an employer that could accommodate my needs and illness. The medical examiner knew my doctor and declared I was disabled. The claims examiner over ruled the doctor and that’s when I had to go to court. I got denied by the judge and my appeal got denied too. I had to build my own case. I went to my school and got my school records. They tested my IQ and claimed I was smart but mentally disturbed. Then I had my step d
ad get my write ups from my former job. After getting denied I had to reapply. It took me 4 years to get to the judge the first time. The second time it took me 2 years to get to the judge. It was a different judge and he ruled in my favor. The claims examiner still said I could work. She said I was smart and pulling one over on the system. As you work you get work credits toward disability. Those work credits determine how much money you get a month. The longer they make you wait the more work credits you lose over time. Social security wants hard proof on paper. You need to prover everything to them and it’s not easy. I had a doctor from a hospital backing me up. I had school records going back to 3rd grade. I had 2 hospitalizations on my record. I had write up for getting in trouble at work and it still took me 6 years. For 6 years I didn’t have a penny to my name.

The only one that came close (at least lowering the volume of the voices) is halidol.

176032257,"I am on invega sustenna 50 mg. I use to go every 4 days or so then I changed my diet drastically and it helped. Now I go every morning about an hour to two hours after I wake up. And It’s not hard rocks like it use to be. You are on more medications than I am so meds are probably the problem. My meal plan is as follows: As soon as I wake up I drink 2 bottles of water. I am usually up by 5am. About an hour is so when I pee all the water out I sit on the toilet relax and try to poo. Sometimes it comes sometimes it doesn’t I don’t force it. It took some time but now it usually comes. After that I shower and start the day I have breakfast: ( usually 8 or 9am) One pear or apple. Or half cup berries. Steel cut oats and 1tbsp chia seeds in the steel cut oats. Honey to sweeten. Water. Lunch:(11 or 12pm) one cup or more of a vegetable. I usually steam _NAME_, broccoli, or spinach. One orange, half cup navy beans. Dinner:(3,4 or 5pm)small serving meat usually tin sardine or chicken. About half the plat
e of a vegetable. I usually have fried zucchini with mushrooms. Half cup navy beans. Half cup of a whole grain product. I usually have quinoa or black rice or barley. If I get hungry I always snack on a fruit or a vegetable or nuts. Preferably something high fiber. I drink about 5 (500ml)water bottles everyday. Sometimes more. I try to finish my dinner by 4 pm. And I try to eat at the same time every day. Beans have been my saviour because they are high in fibre. I might be gassy but I don’t care. My body loves routine. I use dry beans that you soak overnight then cook. Preferably navy beans cause they are one of the highest in fibre. I cut out all processed foods and only eat whole foods now as close to nature as I can get. Except for the tin sardine but I may not perfect and I have days where I am just plain lazy. Also I don’t eat white rice or white bread anymore. Nothing bleached. Only whole grain. Try to get more than 30g of fibre a day. Sorry it’s so long. Hope this helps."

More weight given to the input of a person’s GP or consultant A higher level of honesty when it comes to the assessors used No directives as to acceptable levels of successful claims . My situation re the mobility component illustrates how dishonest assessors can be . At the assessment , with my brother with me , my brother clearly stated I needed someone physically with me on unfamiliar journeys. The assessor’s report dishonestly said I just needed prompting . No mobility component given . When they reassessed people with mental health problems re mobility I was told there was not enough new information to change that in my case . I put in a MR . I was told because I don’t go out much and not very far from home I don’t qualify . The reason I 
don’t go very far from home? Poor sense of direction and possible agoraphobia . I just don’t ask to be taken anywhere that’s not to do with appointments and shopping because my stepdaughter does enough driving for me without payment anyway . I’ll occasionally pay for a few bits she gets in the supermarket , and she gets the nectar points from my shopping . Hence I don’t go anywhere much because I can’t pay my stepdaughter for such journeys without finding it harder to cope financially . It’s basically a catch 22 situation .

176032433,i feel like since i only get a allowance once a week that when i get money i have to spend it soon. its like since im not use to having money that im not good at saving it. my dad is my payee so all my bills are paid and i dont have anything really to have to buy unless i just want it. but i felt bad for losing 40 bucks because now im 40 bucks poorer lol. and i dont know if there will be anything else i need to buy before next allowance. i still have some left but im starting to get suspicious if i have a gambling problem or not. because if i dont go to the slot machine room then i might buy scratch off tickets at the gas station to see if i win any money. i know once i have a good win that i will stop gambling for a while and i havent had a win yet so thats what im still playing for.
176032434,I would say symptoms started appearing after a month. They gradually got worse.

176032469,good to hear you you got everything straight again =)… i hope things keep getting better.
176032470,We’ve told you a million times the whole world is not watching or thinking that of you. You are suffering from a delusion that is somewhat common in schizophrenics. One or these days you’ll understand that. I get that on a smaller scale sometimes. Sometimes I think everybody around me is thinking of me. But it’s just because I am self centered and I often get a glimpse into reality which is most other people are only thinking of themselves and it pains me that I waste so much time reacting to people when I find out I’m nothing special. I know how exhausting your delusion can be-and mine.

176032475,Invega will leave and lose it’s effectiveness in 25 days and at most 49 days per the tests. After the half life it can’t have much effectiveness. Many people have had good luck with Invega for some time. If you go off try to find another anti-psychotic.

174350076,"The sleep hallucinations is called hypnogogia/hypnopompia, and it is not a symptom of schizophrenia. It can be stress-induced or worsened, and dreams tend to get more wonky when the brain is overloaded. I’ve heard the hypnogogia happens because your brain and body don’t quite agree on whether they’re awake or asleep, so you’re physically awake while your brain is dreaming. Schizophrenia is altered reality when awake. Sensory input that’s skewed or only perceived by you, and things like delusions. It does sound to me like you’re stressed, and it’s starting to get to you. It could be an idea to see a therapist to get help managing your stress better before you take damage."

see. I guess he was understanding and I guess the right person will come along that willing to deal with me and my illness.

174350087,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but I can’t help but think you have adopted nihilism as a personal philosophy. You’re right that something bad or unfortunate about having schizophrenia and going through the hell of it is nothing good. It simply is “damage,” as you stated, but there is an opportunity afterward for reflection and growth. Don’t believe the lie that once a person is damaged he or she is done and that’s it. The human condition is riddled with suffering, but that does not steal your individual will to perceive something good out of all your experiences. Finding the meaning and holding on to it gives people an opportunity to transform and help others in that same process. Nihilism is cool because it is somewhat edgy, and of course, it’s easy. However, it robs the enjoyment of exploring the vastness of human potential with love and forgiveness. By the way, I’m a huge fan of _NAME_ and _PERSON_ !

176032522,"Twelve years ago now I was suddenly struck by a voice within saying clearly, calmly, and forcefully…“Look at what you have become!”. That night I tore myself, or was torn apart. I threw myself, or was thrown about the bed…Going through all sorts of stuff. Firstly, the voice told me that I was Jesus ( I’m not at all religious btw ), told how wonderful, glorious, fantastic…You get the picture. All of a sudden…“You miserable, disgusting, little piece of…How could something like you be…Look at yourself…” Anyhoo…This went on for a bit when all of a sudden…“You are actually neither, you are God!” “IT JUST DOESN’T WORK!!!” I screamed…Then calm, blissful calm, after a night of torment. “You exist in a single instant of time, outside of time.” That was that! Gosh thanks. Anyway, I have thought about it for, well, twelve long years now and…HELP!!! I have destroyed my brain. I have figured it all out. Well, most of it anyway. There is a singularity within three di
mensional time. Real-Time/Imaginary-Time/Space-time Successive “BANGS”, of the singularity produce the “flow” of time, and this Universe is mirrored. I am/was _PERSON_, twins, half and half. I divided (asexual reproduction became sexual reproduction). I met myself and fell in love. In our mirror universe, matter and anti-matter combined/joined, with just one pair of twinned particles becoming yin-yang, and trapping time between themselves. I, me, the me here, let’s call me (a) and I, me, the me there, let’s call me (A) have now become just me. She, her, the her here (b) with whom I am so overwhelmingly in love (never having met - very odd), I mean, you literally could not possibly even come close to understanding how much I love her…I want to spend every instant of forever watching the wonder in her eyes. I need those eyes to see all the beauty that there is to be seen…etc: (Hurts) I see absolutely no way for us to meet, and in my current reality she is pregnant with another man’s child. The
refore; it’s over. No “happily-ever-after” for all. I am destroyed. But on the bright side…I just got told that I’m “Love”. (a) and (b) brought “Love” into the Universe…Can I still just “Turn to stone?”. Do I have to stay on this pointless merry-go-round? I have seen things that you cannot imagine. I have felt emotions so powerful that you could not possibly comprehend. I have lived a life that is beyond belief…AND I WANT OUT!!! THIS IS HELL!!!"

176032543,"BBC News The biggest medical breakthroughs of 2019 The year of treating the untreatable: 2019 breakthroughs that could transform medicine. “It was like [being the] first man on the Moon,” said 30-year-old _PERSON_. He was describing the moment he was able to take his first steps since being paralysed in a fall two years ago. He can now move all four of his paralysed limbs with a mind-controlled exoskeleton suit. His movements, particularly walking, are far from perfect and the robo-suit is being used only in the lab. But researchers say the approach could one day improve patients’ quality of life. _PERSON_’s doctors have performed a seemingly impossible feat - a girl with a deadly brain disease has been given a unique drug that was invented from scratch just for her and all in less than a year. She was diagnosed with fatal and untreatable Batten disease. The eight-year-old’s medical team in Boston performed whole-genome sequencing - a detailed interrogation - on _PERSON_’s DNA, her gene
tic code, and uncovered a unique mutation that was causing her disease. Having seen the fault, the researchers thought it might be possible to treat it. They designed a drug, tested it on Mila’s cells and on animals in the laboratory and won approval to use it from the US Food and Drug Administration. Drugs normally take about a decade and a half to get from the laboratory, go through clinical trials and get to patients. The US team got there in a year. A new way of editing the code of life could correct 89% of the errors in DNA that cause disease. The technology, called prime editing, has been described as a “genetic word processor” able to accurately re-write the genetic code. It is a bit like pressing Ctrl-F to find the bit of text you want to change, then pressing Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V to copy over the new text (or the command key if you’re a Mac user). There are some 75,000 different mutations that can cause disease in people and the researchers say prime editing can fix nearly nine in 10 of them. It 
has already been used to correct damaging mutations in the lab, including those that cause sickle cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs disease (a rare and fatal nerve condition)"

176032573,"Before You ask the question; How dopamine leads to hallucinations ? Ask yourself ; Do you know what is hallucination as it as in its actual nature? As the person feels it inside himself ,outside the diagnostic material of any external observer who feels nothing ! As we say, the main task of the human science is just to know what is the actual Supernatural Characteristics of the phenomena that be called hallucination (of sz condition ), in the case,if you do not know the hallucination as it as in its nature, all your attempts well be fail to find any causal relationships between it And any biological, anatomical ,genetic,chemical ,medical,psychological,environmental factors ,because it is stranger supernatural characteristics from all aspects ! Therefore,the therapist who tries to designs a typical treatment to overcome the bad side symptoms that arise from the influence of the hallucination on the content of the person’s cognitive culture And on mental chemistry background (Directions,Path,quanti
ty,types,instantaneous velocity,repetition rate per unit time…etc of the self electrochemical signals ) He must know everything about the hallucination as it as in itself from A to Z ,a prerequisite that his data knowledge corresponds to the actual reality of the hallucination (composition,function,operating mechanisms,influence moods,the host reactions that arise from the H’s influence on the human basic nature He must know the GPS of the hallucination in the basic nature of the human host ( How the substance of hallucination distributed in the basic nature of the person ) The time and speed of the Main Process of hallucination that induces the endless cognitive change in the self-knowledge that leads to endless functional disorder in the mental chemistry processes And the bad side effects of these processes ( we meant the symptoms that you diagnose,classify, and call them the symptoms of schizophrenia ! ) First thing you should notice,is the essential difference between your outlook of the sz’s sympto
ms and our view of them We view them (except the hallucination) as the final outcome of the metabolism outcomes of the Main Process of (H) which affects on the content of the cultural data which implicited in the self mental process And the associated biochemical background , These symptoms in reality,THEY are bad side effects of hallucination effectiveness that must be eliminated by all means Available to restore the stability to the mental state and the balance to the chemical background ,and make the person in the best condition to resist the successive influences all time of wakefulness !"

176032581,"Hello forum I’m here to talk about my sz journey. A lot has happened since I was last here 2 months ago it always amazes me to look back and see all the events that unfolded. As for my employment, I had to quit retail and go back to food. It was the best choice I ever made though, retail is the type of work that I believe turns people of society into drones, it’s very macabre to see how miserable and how much corporate abuse my coworkers would take from them. Food is a much better career area for me, because in my articular store I always get characters and wild cards that I never would have met anywhere else and I love meeting and hearing their stories. I am now unhireable at my last job because they took my resignation as disrespectful and said I caused a commotion, apparently 5 people quit right after me so it is now my headcanon that they all saw my notice and were like “this dude has the right idea I’m out of here.” hahahaha take that retail overlords!!! As for another event; My wife
’s mother moved in with us and it has been hell on earth. She is very fear mongery and abrasive and I feel like I am living with my emotionally abusive mother again that I moved away from when I was 18. I am now writing up an eviction notice because I will not be having this behaviour influence my 2 year old and have her become messed up in some way because of this nuisance. I have been unmedicated for a while because I no longer have insurance and bills are too expensive, luckily I have actually doing pretty well despite the stressors in my life. My wife has helped me a lot and I have been doing way better at socializing and forcing myself to be a better/happier person (although I still have my wild thoughts and such). I’m very lucky to have such awesome coworkers who aren’t baised against me because of my SZ, they all (at least say to me) that it’s charming that I am myself and don’t care what others think despite my hurdles and shortcomings in life. I have more to say but I must take care of some
