175956425,"I experienced that. I was a patient in a clinic and my psychiatrist was wired, and talked to me only about a minute before going straight to the medicine. I said something like, ""You not talking very much (about my well being, etc.)"" and she said: ""I see 20 patients a day and there's not time to talk!!!"" Her superiors were putting too much of a patient load on her, and she was a caring person, so that didn't fit. I was telling her about taking that ""Three Day Getaway"" from Delta Airlines to the Bahamas. She's since calmed down. So, I think you're right. Sometimes we do have to look out after our psychiatrists. They look out after us. Or as you said, ""So if you work in the mental health field, or if you're a patient like I was, you may see that a provider needs a vacation before that individual realizes it."""

The last time I was there they removed a mole that turned out to be benign. I am nervous they will find something but I hardly ever sunbathe. I find sunbathing boring and I don't like the beach. I never spend time with my shirt off. When I go running or play golf, I will put sunscreen on my face, neck, arms and legs. My family never really has had a skin cancer issue. My grandfather had it on his face but that is because he worked outside alot. I am 30 years old so I don’t think I am at a huge risk for bad skin cancer. In spite of all this, I am worried about melanoma or some other cancer. I was supposed to go back to the dermo to get the spot they removed checked out as apart of a follow up but I never went in (insurance reasons). I figured if the spot had changed for the worse, I would have know by now. Hopefully all will go well but I am still a bit

174343307,"Hello _PERSON_, I'll share my story with you. I have paranoid schizophrenia. For some time in my life I didn't know what was going on until it progressively got worse. I was put out on the street because of it because people didn't understand it. I wasn't on medication, and people thought I was just a crazy person instead of trying to get to know me. I would be hostile towards people that I thought were doing wrong to me. You constantly hear voices that sound like real people telling you to do things or saying things to you that make you feel paranoid. I thought my own family was going to poison me or the world was after me. I had these symptoms for 10 years until it got really bad. I was going to go to jail or prison at some point because the things I did to others and my self were dangerous. I did and said things to people because I was trying to protect myself and those around me. I thought I was protecting myself. People often have stigmas around this disorder. They often think that we are craz
y when if you think about it, you would probably react the same way as well to voices and visuals you think are real. They are downright scary at times. I would see shadows figures on walls, and hear creepy demonic voices. The strange thing is sometimes the voices were calming and helpful. It wasn't always a negative experience but when it was negative, it is REALLY negative. Luckily it isn't like the 40s or 50s anymore where the medication we take use to fry our brains. I take some now and have gotten better, but it definitely effected my life a lot."

I catch myself and shake it off telling myself to get a grip and think of good times. I haven't had this issue for, oh wow close to 6 months. My psychiatrist said I was having delusions (sight or hearing) and suggested individual therapy or he could adjust my medication. Not really wanting to do either, I tried to stay positive and busy.

I was gonna say thank you but I didn't.. Then I said ""Thank you"". I was writing down my dream to put on Facebook as I was dreaming and as I pressed send, the multiple paragraphs and the phone disappeared and I was like ""Welp.. Whatever.."". Then I had a friend ""_NAME_"" that took my med box and put an acid blotter on his eye and became 
blind in one eye.. his eye turned black so he got a handgun and started shooting me and then we got to a place where him and some other guy was holding my head, preparing to shoot my head and I said ""Put the gun under my temple and shoot up towards my brain"" - Then I pushed the gun with the bone under my temple, turned around, pointed at one of their heads and thought about putting the bullet between both of their heads but I shot it in the air and said ""There's no more bullets left"". The night before I owned a pharmaceutical company and I was in a building with fluorescent lights.. Seemed kinda sketchy.. There was about 100 people in desks, drawing molecules with radioactive atoms attached to them.. Must have been my pharmaceutical mind and something to do with my moms radiation...

I had a previous adolescent client ask me to stop using the term BPD while discussing her challenges because “I don’t believe I have that. If I don’t believe I have that, then neither should you.” Stunned by this attempt at controlling a professional, I offered to emphasize only the symptoms and leave the label behind, at least during the hour of psychotherapy.

175956543,"There are a lot of questions implying a kind answer, especially those expressing doubts about yourself or something you did. People think that you want to be pleased, or it's just etiquette to give a nice answer. Sometimes it's okay, but other times I would like to receive a sincere answer, expressed with some tact: I don't like to be hurt, but I need to know the truth to understand how to regulate my behaviour. For example, with a friend: would you prefer to meet X this evening? Didn't you like my gift? Did I annoy you when I did/said/asked that? I get lost in these situations. I try to deduct my answer through indirect observations, but it can become very ambiguous, and if I ask, it's ambiguous too. Suggestions?"
175956544,"I mostly use online recipes but for cookies I use the back of the nestle pkg, same for krispy treats. These days I store my recipes in an app called paprika it just copies an online recipe which is handy because some of the blogs I use have gone under then I lose the recipes...there was a really nice veggie meatloaf I lost that way. Yeah I know what you mean about the huge recipes ...I do rarely bake now because I have no where to bring leftovers and I sure can’t eat it all. The one benefit to cookies is you can usually freeze the dough though....which is great if you’re feeling lazy and want cookies"

175956554,"To each their own, so please don't apologize for doing your best in life and getting less than a desirable outcome. Those of us that have long suffered similar fates may cry along with you every step of the way, but it could be just that keeping us down. Excessive apologizing, reflecting, reminiscing, etc. all put us down as though we deserve to be sad or sorry for doing our best. The ways in which we talk to ourselves, and especially talking down to ourselves, is most common among the depressed. Perhaps a better way is to turn around those thoughts into forward moving goals.. even if extremely tiny, that invert depression into hope. So wish for a brighter tomorrow. Plan to enjoy yourself one way or another with whatever opportunities are acceptable to those whom your actions might matter. Live boldly and proudly because you deserve that much more so than kicking yourself. Even if only just in tiny ways, express yourself.. take risks that don't matter.. Dream of your better days that lie ahead and 
Remember: Most of the time, the only person stopping you: Is you."

God my mom. _PERSON_, but as far as myself, I’m always pushing my limits on my brain. My intelligence. I think, “if I can do this, I wonder if I can do this”. And I go further and further. I just keep going and I can’t stop. I love learning and knowledge and I like to read books and things that push the limits of what my intelligence could do. Idk how to explain it. I have this obsession with pushing my brain to complete tasks, as far as intellectually goes, until I pretty much get sick (nowadays). I seem to have been doing this since I been sick. My brain showed me what it could do with being sick and then while I was sick (you keeping up?), I kept pushing it further and further. And that’s partially how I got into philosophy."

My question is kind of off topic here, but I am most comfortable asking all you... My Dr wants me to take 5mg of Rosuvastatin Calcium at bedtime daily. My cholesterol is high but I'm terrified of statins and their side effects... Please, if anyone is on Rosuvastatin, can you let me know your experiences with it? It's good to be back!

Or it could make it better.."
175956572,"If you live with bipolar disorder, I am sure you have at some point felt the anger and/or irritability that comes with the illness. It can happen with mania or depression. Some of us, myself included, thought that the irritability only came with mania, but I learned we can be feel the same way when you are depressed. I am going to use some movies to help illustrate these symptoms. First let’s take a trip to ‘Silver Linings Playbook.’ First of all, you must see this movie if you live with bipolar disorder. _NAME_ portrays a man with bipolar disorder quite well. There is a scene in which he gets pissed off because he does not like the ending of the book he just read. He barges into his parents room and in the middle of the night and starts ranting and yelling. He then throws the book out the window, breaking it. During this episode the police shows up. In another scene he is looking for his wedding video, getting more and more irritated that he cannot find it. After searching the house he start
s to yell. Then his anger shows when he and his father get into a fight, like fisticuffs. His dad ends up with a black eye. As per usual, the police are called and the cop assigned to his case shows up as the neighbors yell. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/07/28/bipolar-disorder-anger-and-irritability/"

So all should calm down then."
174343498,"*Not Schizoid* Allegedly, but do get very powerful daydreams sometimes. Some are very positive, imagining doing things I have always wanted to, to incredibly violent ones, to constant negative internal chatter and judgement. Sometimes I make myself abit sick and catch myself going to far, triggering paranoia or anxiety. Outside of that I just accept everything I think about as part of me, or a process of dealing with external issues and stress, even if in a disordered way. If they don’t have a negative consequence, Me personally I don’t concern myself that much with them. I’m not sure if schizoids daydreams can blur reality and imagination, like a break in reality like you would see in schizophrenia I could see that being a big problem. I wouldn’t beat yourself up for having ones you don’t actively believe in."
175956577,I quit. It has nothing to do with it killing me. It's the fact it sucks quality of life away. Long term smoking will cause you to miss out on life opportunities and live with more discomfort long before you are ready to kick the bucket. I'm at risk for things that smoking will undoubtedly irritate. It is exceptionally amazing though. I get happy just thinking about it and it's been years since I smoked. Brings a stupid smile to my face and makes me lick my lips. I spent a year dedicating my life to the action. Found a used corduroy bean bag with a hole I sewed up. Pulled it in the corner and people could barely see me through the fog.

So that is a possibility. But the benefits may outweigh the negatives of the medicine. You're not going to find a medicine that is not going to have side effects. It says the medicine can be effective."
175956598,Possible trigger: People are after me and against me because I’m a bad person and deserve to die in traffic.

I went to bed early (for me), about 10:30pm and slept way in, not getting up until 10am. Yeah, the Zyprexa is really making me tired. It'll be another low key day.

Plus I am not able to be at home with her, as I will be needing to work two jobs to support myself, pay rent. In home nurse costs a fortune from what I have read. I also feel it would devastate my Mom to be pulled away from my sister. I asked my Mother over the weekend if she would like to live with me, she said she would love to but not right now. She feels dedicated to my sister still. it is all so overwhelming, to fight this on my own. My other sister, I feel would not be of too much help. she has an alcohol addiction problem currently, so I feel I would not get much help from her. She is very good at starting trouble in the family, but not helping much. She has not even visited my mother since May, and is about a hour and a half away from my sister. as I am 3 and 1/2. I do not ev

When I'm happy, I feel smart in a way where I'm more creative (More than stupid in my perspective of what I believe other people think because I'm losing touch with reality - Also because being happy is a quasi-delusional state where I have more self esteem so I’d obviously have more faith that I’m smarter). Then with my thoughts about how other people see me when I'm depressed, I feel like they think that I'm smarter because I talk less and think more realistically and logically than they do but inferior because I'm less creative (Also that people are concerned for me. People see the opposite in themselves which breaks their own delusion because it’s just faith that is holding onto something that isn’t real. You’d need to be manic for it to be rea

That's why people with no empathy (Sociopaths) to feel what another person feels AND can't see the mirror effect (Psychopaths) and put people down to make themselves feel better (And they never get psychosis). Does this explain why people in mania become psychotic?"

175956650,Groceries
175956651,I was also sleepy when taking a higher dosage about 12.5mg a day. Now they have me on it and it I've been on 675mg a day for the last couple weeks.
175956652,"Hope you're feeling better, LuvMyDad. I had the same issues with my breasts for years. Any scars were thick, ropy, itchy & the old, surgical scar on my neck felt like it was trying to pull apart & then I started feeling like I was choking on pills, food, then even water. Then it started to hurt like I'd be karate-chopped in the front of the neck. I could tell, the scar tissue was growing inside, too. The allopath, (I'm forced to see)wanted to do a endoscope. I realize the dangers because my aunt just almost died from a super-infection from one. Learned about systemic(proteolytic) enzymes and see many natural health experts advising them altho my dr insisted they'd 'injure me'. What they did is cure me. No more choking and front neck pain, breast lumps GONE and all other scars are now tiny, light lines. I don't take pharma drugs so didn't need to worry about contraindications. Blood thinners is one. I use ProOneZyme. They're quite costly and it takes 2 or 3 months before noticing a difference but th
ey work and cause me no stomach troubles at all. They MUST be taken on empty stomach or they won't work. I took 3 capsules every morning and didn't eat for 1/2 hour-1 hour afterwards. They also cleaned my lungs up and I can breathe freely & deeply. To me, they are a miracle."
175956653,Have you talked to your therapist or doctor recently? It might be a good idea to let them know what’s going on
175956654,*hugsss*
175956655,It says 667mg per capsule
174343620,I wish I could ski these days. Living like what? I'm not sure what you mean by that.
175956656,"I am so sorry, newtus. When do you talk to your pdoc next? How about today?"
175956657,No! Make art! It's all we must do.. What you wrote is a good rap lyric...
175956658,I showered this morning
175956659,"Yeah, heart stuff tends to be more morning than night, often, and has no real relationship to eating, so... I forget your age. Maybe get some Prevacid next time you are at store and try it out, see if it helps. It is quite safe. Hugs."
175956660,I wasn’t saying chemicals to judge so much as to be accurate....there is a difference in receptor when you’re talking endogenous chemicals vs what you take.....one has regulation and ebb and flow and the other is one big dose....it can change the way the receptor responds...if you take one dose and the receptor got supercharged it might just down regulate itself.
175956661,I’ve been feeling tired for a few days due to a low quality of sleep. I’ve been having nightmares.
175956662,"I did look at the meds and if I looked hard enough I could find some anger issues that you said you had. You also were taking anti-depressants without a stabilizer, but it's good you're on the right track now. I went through all of that so I know what that's like. So you do have relatives who had emotional problems. Some of them may have been bipolar but got miss diagnosed, which is something you and I know about. You say, ""I would believe I was expert at certain things, so wrong."" You mean like a know it all? And you add, ""I'm difficult in relationships."" Yeah, I could tell you about some of those. If you reach a certain age, you don't really need that. But at younger ages, you think that's real important. That's my free overtime for the day."
175956663,I hope I get my other unemployment check soon.
175956664,Got caught up on the roll call! Boy I miss a lot when I'm not on during the weekend!
175956665,"Went to bath and body works and got a few things. Some foaming soap, and some scent diffuser refills for the apartment. I had a little money left over from when I watched my dads dog when he was gone. Plus I'm back off cigs and have tons of beer. So I dont need the money for that. I havent been drinking at all really. I dont drink when it's super hot outside cuz it dehydrates me more."
175956666,"Yeah, now I just have to deal with all the Christmas presents that need wrapping! I need _NAME_ to come along, sing a song, snap her fingers, and do it for me!!!!!"

175956669,"I remember playing Vice City and San _NAME_ a lot when I was a kid.. Some other ones too. That's when I was feeling mentally well. I was just happy running over hookers and pedestrians, stealing cops cars, buying semi automatics, etc"
175956670,"To the ones that are considering 'ending it all.. (Oh God do I understand?) Being bullied and left out gets too hard!) ..I tried to end mine but sister figured it out,she called 911 and I woke up 2 days later in ICU. I just went off on EVERYONE in my family .. I know if I ever try again-itll work. I have been bullied since age of 4 and then life is just sad for me. I hope NO ONE else feels this bad but I understand Dr. _PERSON_ actions now and if you're sad.. I understand 100%. I love you if you're in pain. Or alone. Or even if you hate.

175956671,"Hey, I'm having a good time down at my parents. Been going out on a few walks. Had nice weather for it. Think we are going out as a family for a walk tomorrow since it's going to be a really nice day. Have lunch out too. Also went to see Detective _USER_ID_ with my sister and nephew. Was good fun. He found it scary at the beginning but enjoyed it after that. Got a few days left down here. How's everyone else getting along?"
175956672,"I feel like quitting graduate school again. I literally have my thesis only left to write. I'd be so much happier without this stupid thing though. Just want to quit. Just sent my therapist an email about it. Hopefully, she understands what I'm talking about. I hate this program. So not worth my time."
175956673,SP just told me something. She said the steroid shot I got for my back might be causing this. She said it can affect vision and cause mood changes and behaviors. That must be why i been needing my glasses more often lately and this mania. Cuz I'm rarely like this. I'm usually depressed.
175956674,"They say I'm a lazy slob... I'm undeserving of everything good. I should die. I don't deserve anything good. I deserve all the bad. I deserve everything bad. I""m an ungrateful *****. My stepdad is right to slam the cabinets and scream dammit and run upstairs because I can't wait to wash off my strawberries in the sink he was putting away dishes when I did it. He works all day and I'm always home on my ***. I'm a *****. I'm a stupid *****. They wont stop. I just want to be happy. I just want them to go away. Please go away. PLease. I can't take it. I can't take much more of this. I'm trying to calm down but I can't."
175956675,"Sp, idk if the se has it, but I think you can adjust the blurriness in _USER_ID_ mode. At least I can."
175956676,"I feel like I need the Stoic philosophy right now. I feel like the Stoics knew what they were talking about with respect to ""weathering the storm"" so to speak."
175956677,Can I clarify.... What do you mean by she’s over it? Do you mean (1) you think she’s over the relationship or do you mean (2) you think she’s over the things you tried talking with her about and moved past them?
175956678,Was that before or after sz?
175956679,Prozac is stronger than Lexapro. its the strongest ssri. it took me 4 tries last time to find a med that o could tolerate and that worked. sometimes trial and error are the only way to find a med that works.

175956682,Thanks. Do you know how long it takes to get back results for a pelvic mri though. Can I get some advice on that. Thanks. I have anxiety not knowing when i will.

175956685,"Yeah, it's pretty fun. I bought it on the PS Vita when it first came out, then re-purchased it on the Switch. I haven't played it on the Switch yet, but I plan to do so and then get DQB 2. I found that the Vita was kinda small for DQB. Playable, but small. I'm also replaying some of my GB, GBC, and GBA games from a long while back. I need to replace the batteries in some of them, though. I'm currently modifying my Game Boys to make the screens light up (since the originals of course don't light up at all). I don't like those 90s ""worm lights"" that cause a glare on your screen..."
175956686,"I am very sorry for your losses. It is common to experience changes in libido while grieving. I hope to encourage you to have self-compassion and patience with the process while you grieve. In my personal experience, losing more than one loved one in a short time as well as losing someone to suicide specifically, can be especially difficult. Please allow yourself time and space to heal. Your engagement following so soon after your brother's passing is a a red flag that maybe your grief has been overlooked. The honesty and clarity demonstrated in your post make me believe that you are well-equipped to communicate with your fiance. Facing the challenges of your current situation together has potential to strengthen your bond. I wish you the best."

When I really have urges to self-harm and depending on what emotions are coming up, I usually break or destroy things but in very constructive ways.

175956694,"she is been treated actively here, going on weekly visits, but the problem is that she is not totally honest with the doctor because of trust issues; she sometimes feels doctors are planning something against her, or if she will tell them everything, they might use against her. For instance, she never revealed to me that she was hearing commands and voices very strongly but now after listening to her, she finally admits that she are actively receiving commands in her own head and sometimes those includes killing me as a precaution to her. This is where I got really scared, because I can see her staring at me sometimes very strangely like she is totally occupied by something else; which is ofcourse her voices. She thinks her daughter and son are not real sometimes, and they might be replaced by someone else; specially the people she have some terrible experiences. My daughter was also complaining to me, that she stairs at me strangely, and ask me sometimes are you my real daughter."

175956700,"Whatever the resident ""knows"" I think he shared with others. I'm sick of this place. When you finally talk to someone, all they want to do is exchange gossip from the home. I think that's why people are acting weird around me. I don't socialize here though, so it isn't really that important. The Saturn progression I'm having is part of my yod of death so to creatively contain it I can sit out in public studying my giant edition of Christian Astrology. It helps that it struck me fluidly. God knows I'm rusty but not that rusty. I love the hell out of my edition. You can't get one anymore and you really have to be motivated to study and work from the facsimile. I'm so glad that so far I don't. It's just a really good idea."

I’ve had so much stress, anxiety, tension, depression, guilt, Shame, and sadness built up for a while now.... today it just exploded and I’ve had the worst panic attack that I’ve had in five years!!!!!!! I mean full blown heart beating out of my chest, sweating, clammy hands and feet, nauseated panic attack. I called the ambulance and they convinced me I wasn’t having a heart attack, or any heart related issues period. I refused a trip to the hospital because I’m afraid of coming in contact with the corona virus !!!!! The panic attack lasted 4 hours or so.. until I drifted off to sleep for about an hour or so. Now I cannot sleep. I’m tired. I feel sleepy. But when Is down I can’t wait go into deep sleep. I just toss and turn. I’m 27 years old I’ve been having anxiety/ depression for 12 years. The worst crippling anxiety ever. It fit better 3 years ago after I had my daughter. Nuts it’

My boss was outside on her smoke break they had to get staff accom manager to unlock the door they used rope and tuct tape. As i yelled for help...

My last blood test was last August idk if they check hormone levels with a reg full blood count but everything was fine good thyroid my dr never suspected I have high estrogen I really don’t want to go to her again.

He seemed to be asking me if I really wanted to get well. Well, doh. Of course!!! He told me to stay out of the hospital. Believe me, I plan to. Hospital was already calling me for payment yesterday. My insurance covered most of it, but I have copays that I have to pay. I couldn't pay the whole thing so I paid one third and then set up payments for the balance. I still have the pay the ER and the ambulance too. That was one expensive SH episode! I can't believe the hospital was calling for payment already. I haven't even been out a week. The claim isn't even showing on my insurance website yet. Sheesh. Money sucking vampires. Lol. Totally want to sleep this afternoon, but you know....work. Kind of gets in the way.

175956780,"Well I get auditory hallucinations. I have talks with various famous people. Satan, God, Jesus was my husband and having an affair with the woman whose my case manager, younger, better hair. We had 3 kids, one looked just like a mini Jesus. I was talking with _NAME_ and _NAME_. I'm American. _NAME_ didn't want _NAME_ to marry _NAME_ instead he wanted him to marry me, so I was going through tests but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't pull him from _NAME_ they are solid. I was auditioning for producers and writing songs that other spirits helped me write. Including _NAME_ who stole my song about my son, he's favored by God. He tied his hands to mine to steal more of my ideas. I wrote out stars on paper, burned pictures of ex family members, and burned songs written about or by the devil we had a sexual relationship he was really into me, i prayed and begged God to save me. These hallucinations lasted about a year and aren't in sequence. Because I remembered out of order. When _NAME_ went crazy sh
e was part of my hallucination. Back than _NAME_ was really into me, hallucinating, this is circa 2006 But I thought he was the devil disguised so I tried to marry him to _NAME_. She went crazy that very day. _NAME_ is also part of my psychosis. I just remember him being around not exactly sure the interactions. I think he was like a father figure. _NAME_ proposed to me the 2nd hallucinating experience I decided to say yes prior times always said no. I always feel like there are tests I have to pass experiences I'm supposed to have. Oh forgot at the hospital I was talking to Jehovah. My vision went from 20/15 to needing glasses again. I was virtually blind for a week before my family brought me an old pair of glasses. I believed Satan healed my eyes in attempt to take my soul. I always wanted lazik. Jehovah undid Satan's work, but healed my foot. Saved my soul. I felt under spiritual attack. I asked to be rebaptized my church said no. I was reading the bible a lot using lavendar oil. I told God I would strugg
le the rest of my life if it meant my soul was saved. I really believe my soul was on the line. My eyes were really healed now they are not."

175956785,"Thanks for the response so far. With regards to the anger part, I don’t do it frequently, at least not anymore, but similar to what was said above, I hold it in for a long time and then something small appears to set me off, when in fact it was just the cumulation of all the previous issues. The relationship/emotional feelings I have are also infrequent, but when they occur, as they are now, they are pretty intense. I have been in a fairly emotionless marriage for 25 years and am a recovering alcoholic too. Clean and sober now for 3-years. When I was drunk, I expressed emotion, but when sober, I do not. Is that true of SPD diagnosed individuals too? The person I have the strong feelings for is not my wife, but someone I met in recovery 3-years ago, and have stayed in infrequent contact with via social media and texts. I visited her about 9 months ago, and shortly after that, the strong feelings seemed to develop. Thanks again"

175956794,"Fair enough. I don't follow him or any public figure enough to know what they're like - and if I look at the vast majority of people I've had faith in, I certainly can't claim that I'm a good read of others either. This has left me concerned now. I've been wondering how someone like my dead boyfriend's older brother is going to survive if he was ever released and how would they decide who gets released? He's been in for well over 20 years now. He got a heavy sentence because it was an officer of the law + since it was proven that it was close range / execution style, it was considered premeditated (however that works) Sentencing doesn't necessarily make him more dangerous than other prisoners - it just reflects the status of the victim + what charges they were able to prove + whether or not he could afford a good lawyer. I'd have deemed their mother, out after about 10 years, the more high-risk one. Yet, the entire time she's been out, she's not been involved in anything like that again. There's no 
doubt in my mind that she would have pressured him to pull the trigger. ^ He was very young and would have been in adrenaline mode, and it's not hard to mindlessly follow directions in that state - especially if they come from a voice you recognize as trustworthy and an authority. ^ (Milgram Experiment and Stanford Prison Experiment show people doing dumb $#%^ for less authoritative people than that) Humorous tangent: not that I liked her much, but she was easier to get along with than my mother. Primarily because she was less demanding and didn't get abusive or all punishing when she didn't get her way. Anyways, like most institutionalized people, he would come out with having received no real treatment for his underlying issues, and with little-to-no coping, vocational, tasks of daily living skills, etc. There's probably not going to be support for anyone who's released either (other than maybe a welfare check). Maybe I should commission to the government for a nice plot of land and start a rescue. A castle 
on a farm with forest + a _NAME_ + a fire pit + a giant clean pond that people (or goldfish) could swim in + a bouncy castle + at the edge of a _NAME_ beach with crystal clear water so you can see down to the bed of pretty coloured pebbles on the lake's floor + a speed boat + ... Then I wonder how my deceased _PERSON_ could have been such as kind, wise, trustworthy and peaceful soul. Such contrast between them."

175956833,"Because the whole scheme of feudalism is about security. You have God, who as a person is a benevolent father figure. You have bishops that protect the soul, and kings and queens that protect the body. Each have a whole hierarchy and a structure, and are for the most part really stable. Popes live long, same as kings, and in the latter, it is the same family, so there is a strong continuity, and not too much innovation, and in fact, innovation is seen suspiciously by most. Humanism is like an adolescent that decides he wants to make his own mistakes. So it is about trying out things and taking risk, as well as making your own decision, as human, and in the name of human. And it is a human that is at the top, that directs and stuff, usually for a limited period of time so things don't get stale. Merchants start going further at sea, taking risk in trading. More wars as well, lots of expansionism and colonization. Interacting with other cultures and dominating them. Etc. I don't know, but it is not p
art of humanism or liberalism. Class system is a medieval thing. There was still some in liberalism, but the end was always not to have any. It goes against individualism, which like I said is the first principle. Class privilege is medieval. No. It's not even close. It's just posturing. It's part of the liberal deception if you want, or how Republics were created. You have an elite that is elected and once this inconvenience is over, they have free reign for a few years. ""Causes"" is more or less people trying to make themselves heard by the elite, or the elite gathering followers, mostly the latter. It's essentially royal petition without a king, so not full humanism, but a step further. There is no responsibility on the part of the petitioners, even less than in the medieval period, where privileges were given, but duties enacted as well. In a liberal republic, the duties is the taxation, so the real responsibility is almost inexistant, and diluted throughout the whole population. In other words, nobody i
s responsible for the $#%^ they propose, and they won't be the one doing anything about it, they just have the right to say stupid stuff. Pigs aren't dictators. They are liberals. They simply are not much different than the aristocrats they replaced in the name of animalism. At least in the eye of a socialist like _PERSON_. Yeah, there is a misunderstanding. There is no such thing as true humanists. Everybody is a humanist in a humanist society. Same as everybody is a liberal in a liberal society. You can't be anything else, but you can long for something else. So when I say some people are feudal, I mean they still long for feudalism, and haven't really accepted humanism, but they are still humanists and liberals, and they have concepts of it, its their base. They are all individualists. They would probably kill themselves in a more communist society. All the structures that made feudalism have been replaced for the most part, gradually, and some people emancipated themselves from bondage of those structures
. Religious authority for one, it was the first, than the kings. The liberal elite replaced them piecemeal, brick by brick by specialists. Then the workers started to emancipate themselves politically. It's the socialists movements that gave everybody the right to vote eventually. For some reason though slaves and women didn't emancipate themselves in the same way, and in fact didn't, except superficially. They were given an opportunity but did not take it. And for some reason they are asking the workers to give them special privileges to compensate, which is not possible since they don't have those privilege to give, since they don't have them. Of course liberals profit from this to kind of rollback advances that were made. And like I hinted earlier, it is not the first time such a thing happened. When Christians emancipated in Europe, Jews were left didn't follow in the same way. And just the same, they asked the Christians to give them privileges they did not have. The only privilege they did have was to h
ave given up Christianity, they emancipated themselves. Jews wanted the same advantages, while still being Jews, which was not possible. And it created the situation we know in the world war. So that is what I mean by still feudal. Just like the Jews hadn't accepted liberalism (now they do), those two groups have to emancipate themselves, not ask others to do it for them, which is not possible, and defeats the purpose to start with. ""True humanists"", that don't exist right now, would be democrats. It's the end game. No more class and race and gender that gets politicized. Or sexual identity. Just the same as people don't vote Christian anymore. It's about looking further than people that looks or think like you. And it is about taking personal responsibility, not waiting for an elite to give it to you, because they don't exist, or at least, some do exist, but they are not any more responsible than any other. They just pretend to be. If a pig gets into a scandal, another takes his place and denounce the othe
r pig. There is no real pig class that can take responsibility as a class, or as pigs. Each pig is an individual, which is why they are emanticipated and not serfs. They were part of the system, but not at the top. Top in temporal matters only, which was the lowest. Like I said, they are all humanists, they simply reject liberalism, but are too afraid to be democrats and leave their idealized self at the door, like an emanticipated person needs to do. It's not an option or anything. It's just that for awhile, pigs had lipstick that made them look like Aristocrats, so some people treated them as such, and that is how they got power and kept it for a few hundred years. But now you get a guy like _PERSON_, there is no denying he is a pig because he has no lipstick at all, just a plain pig. So for those that were dreaming of aristocrats, it was a shock, that a pig could be a shepherd. The whole country went into meltdown, and pigs around the world panicked and started sweating. It's a question of legitimacy. Rule
rs are supposed to be humans, not pigs. Or at least a continuity, just like the kings did, but _PERSON_ broke the spell. This being said, it did not start with him obviously. People have to emancipate themselves, then perhaps the pigs can be replaced by the other animals, just like it was supposed to be. No shepherd, no dogs, just people making decision. But like I said, it seems pretty far away in the future if at all. I didn't say I was able to do that, it's just the impression it gives. Social distancing works because that is how you don't get infected by other people in any way shape or form. And if you have a disease, you don't spread it. Yes, maybe it is your version."

175956839,"Turning to his thematic report, Mr. _PERSON_ explained that it examined conceptual, definitional and interpretative questions arising in relation to the notion of ""psychological torture"" under human rights law. His mandate had long recognized ""psychological"" or ""mental"" torture as an analytical concept distinct from physical torture. It had addressed specific methods or contexts of psychological torture and had pointed to specific challenges arising in connection with the investigation and redress of that type of abuse. The mandate had also dedicated a full thematic report to the practice of solitary confinement. Although those initiatives had been generally well received by States, national practice still tended to deny, neglect, misinterpret or trivialize psychological torture as what could euphemistically be described as ""torture light."""

175956844,"I might have Social Anxiety Disorder. I can talk to people online but that’s only because they can’t really see my face. And I can socialize a bit when I have someone I am friends with but I can barely function by myself in the real world. I have no idea how to help myself and I get so anxious about calling a therapist. I am also in need of a job and I could have one at a warehouse where my mom works at but I get way too anxious and get panic attacks with just the thought of working there. I had to apply though because my parents are irritated that I don’t have a job. And I finally got a call back and now I have maybe about a week or two before they call me back letting me know whether or not I got the job. And I am freaking out with no idea how to calm myself down. (!!TW!! :suicide) I have thought about ending my life just to avoid working and that’s when I realized that I have a very serious issue that I need to get help with, but my anxiety won’t let me get help. So now I’m stuck."

So the other one will be done another time , it was simple update: He told me as long as the other tooth isn't infected or hurting then I don't have to have it pulled. So they just pulled the one that was causing chronic pain for me"
175956846,"Hi Everyone, I thought when I first began posting in the anxiety section here on Healingwell that I would not get many replies as I thought the forum a bit slow. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I want to thank everyone who has offered help and support. I am going to try to respond as best I can to the last three responses I have received and hopefully clear up some things and hope everyone will understand better. Through the years I have always had anxiety about changes in my life. I am not comfortable out of my own environment and get anxious easily. I am not really good at explaining myself and certainly am not up on the terms of mental health so please bear with me. My wife and I will attend therapy together as I found someone close by to help us both with the issue of her father. I am more quiet and reserved as is my wife. My father in law is outspoken and demanding expecting everything to revolve around him. My wife does not stand up to her father and does not want me to say anyth
ing to him. She says its easier for her to just do as he wants because when he does not get his way he is mean and terse. She does not want to deal with him when he is this way. Also my wifes mother died from cancer a few years ago and she asked my wife to take care of her father on her deathbed. My wife is doing this and more. My father in law does not like being alone and wants to go everywhere we go. We can not go on vacation or to visit relatives without him. As strange as it sounds he wants to come with us everywhere. When he is left out of any of our plans he sits and broods acting hurt and upset upon our return. Now that I think about it my feelings toward him are more anger than anxious. Maybe a combination of anxiety and anger. I dont like the way her treats his daughter and she is definitely suffering because of his terse and mean demeanor. We are the only two people who he has in this world and you would think he would be kinder and gentler than he is. Now for my cancer. I do have a gleason score o
f 3+4=7. I am at moderate risk. The problem is my treatment options are now only surgery at this moment. My cancer or my enlarged prostate is somehow putting pressure on my bladder which is causing a partial blockage. My oncologist will not treat me with radiation or seed therapy unless I can get the size of my prostate reduced. Radiation and seed therapy both will cause swelling and stop the flow of urine. I am taking a medication to try to reduce my prostate size enough to allow radiation or seed therapy. All this is causing me extreme anxiety. Lastly I had a two level fusion three years ago. I am having new pain and went back to my surgeon to find the problem. A new MRI revealed the levels above my fusion have gone bad. I now need another fusion at the two levels above my already fused area. I am in pain management and my dr is wonderful in helping with meds to reduce the pain. Needles to say all of this at the same time is just too much for me. My last fusion surgery did not go well so I am very anxious a
bout going through it all again. Having cancer honestly scares me. I know other people have gone through worse but this is something new and again having talked with people on his forum and others about prostate removal is horrible for me. As an example just reading other peoples threads on the prostate forum push me over the edge. I can only read for about fifteen minutes before I have a panic attack and almost shut down for a while. Again thank you everyone for caring and offering your help. I am trying my best to get through all this but am just not good with stressful situations and these three situations are just a lot for me at this time. I so wish I could deal with them one at a time but its all on me at once. I only have one month before my drs say I must do something about my cancer. If the meds do not work then I must have surgery. I can wait on my spinal fusion but its not fun living in pain. My father in law just makes me crazy and my wife tells me we just have to deal with him as best as possible
. I hope the therapist can offer better advice and I pray my wife will take the advice. He needs boundaries and my wife needs to tell her father we cannot spend every minute with him. I cant tell you how bad I need to get away from him for a few weeks. Thank you all very much dmo"

175956857,"I've had the RRoD before on my Xbox 360, but it didn't permanently die on me. I turned it on like a few days after I got the RRoD and it worked fine again. Have you tried unplugging everything and then plugging it all back in? Basically, sometimes the Xbox overheats and you get RRoD. It usually has to do with a combination of the heatsink having problems and too much dust. Not sure how much it'd cost to have someone replace the heatsink (It's only a $10 part, though), but yeah... that's often the cause. Or you have to reflow the circuit board, which I suppose isn't an easy thing to do unless you're used to fixing electronics. But sometimes cleaning the dust out can help, and that's a cheap fix. But in case you don't know, the Xbox One X can't play all Xbox 360 games. For example, Skyrim on the Xbox 360 can't be played on the Xbox One X. You gotta buy the Xbox One X version of Skyrim. It's kinda stupid. But at least the Xbox One X Skyrim is enhanced. 4K, I believe."

175956865,"I've found that in interacting with people, I experience very low energy in relation to how I present myself and respond to them. For example, last week I met a new client for work. As we were talking, it occurred to me, as always, that I seemed to be putting in a minimum of effort in regard to how I dealt with the whole situation. There were questions I could have answered more clearly, questions I forgot to ask, and a general feeling of apathy regarding how I felt I was being perceived. Not good. Drumming up business is important right now, and it's important that I make a good impression. But I was doing the best I could. This is something that occurs, to varying degrees, with most of the people I interact with. When faced with these (or any) kind of social situations, I feel sluggish and unmotivated. I feel like I don't hold myself as rigidly and/or properly as I should. Nor could, but should. It could be called social apathy, brought on by a lack of energy. For me, energy is the key word, beca
use it seems that in these situations, I'm not as cognizant as I could be, but it seems like too much effort to break out of the haze I'm in. Another way to describe it would be comparing it to people who are NOT morning people: the kind of person who wakes up and can't deal with anyone until their coffee has kicked in. I seem to be in that state whenever I have to deal with people; the feeling that you need to shake your head or slap yourself in the face to ""come to"" and be more present. Who can relate to this?"

My mental health continued to decline as I developed OCD and Agoraphobia along with the anxiety.

It's better to be bored and at home instead of bored and in the hospital because you had to escape cabin fever. Here are some suggestions to ward off boredom: 1) Do homework/school work. 2) Surprise mom, do the dishes. 3) Chat with others via the Internet. 4) Clean and rearrange your bedroom. 5) Play a game with a younger sibling. 6) Suggest a Family Movie Night. 7) Read a good book. 8) Make a journal of your time in quarantine and the Coronavirus.

However, I'm nowhere near the dosage I need to be on for the Trileptal to work (if it even does work.) I felt bipolar symptoms for years when an ssri sent me spiraling into bipolar rapid cycles.

175956932,"Hi, _NAME_. You may have already come to a decision since it's been about 3 months since your post, but if you are still looking for opinions, I'd say you should first start documenting the things your ex-husband says or does, both positive and negative. When you read back on your entries, it might present a clearer view. Also, even though your kids are still young, perhaps you could ask them how they feel about seeing their dad, how often they want to see him (after COVID), etc. You can always revisit those questions every year with them. You might find they have their own strong opinions. Since I was young, I knew my parents had an unhealthy relationship and that my father was emotionally abusive and a narcissit. Some kids pray for their parents to stay together, I prayed for mine to get a divorce. They did when I was seven and I remember being relieved. My mom also tried to do what she thought was best and maintain contact between us so my brother and I could have a dad. We never wanted to visit 
him and only went through the motions when we spoke over the phone. He felt little more than a stranger and never contributed financially to support us. On the one hand, I think what would have been easiest for me was to not have him in my life at all. On the other, I think we learn from both positive and negative examples and having him as a model of how NOT to succeed as a compassionate human being helped in my personal growth. I was thankful though when my dad moved out of state a couple of years later and the visits stopped. He still called over the phone, but less frequently as he committed a crime and was in jail for several years. I still responded to his letters because I felt guilty, knowing he was likely lonely in a prison cell. However, when I moved to college I made the conscious decision to stop communications after finding out that the crime he had committed was pretty horrific. He had lied about the reason previously. I'm curious to know what CPS said about the charge against you and the fact t
hat your ex-husband falsified the claim? They might have a recommendation or be able to point you to support resources that will help you and your children's wellbeing. Whatever decision you make, I'm sure it will be with that in mind."

175956934,"First, neither I nor my husband is schizoid. I frequent this forum because I correspond with a friend who is a deep schizoid. Some aspects of my home setup might be useful to you, however. 1) Both my husband and I appreciate solitude and would agree with your definition of being ""alone"". Both of us profoundly resent it when the doorbell rings, unless we're expecting delivery of a package requiring signature confirmation. 2) Not only does my husband have his own study, but this is at the far end of the large basement. So, he essentially has his own floor of the house, as well as his own mini-fridge and half-bathroom. During the day, we usually talk only when he ""surfaces""--coming up to the kitchen to have lunch and dinner. At such times, I can talk as much or as little as I like. He knows this is ""the deal"". Only extremely rarely do I go downstairs to talk to him, and he's forewarned of this by sounds in the stairwell and my ""peeping""--I let out a high-pitched ""peep"" when I reach the botto
m of the stairs. He ""peeps"" back, and I know it's OK to approach him to ask a question. My husband requires humans even less than my extreme schizoid friend. The fact that I have no need to walk past his study door AT ALL when he's home means a lot to him. Hence, the location of your study--whether or not it is in a highly-trafficked area past which people walk--is important. The fact that my husband can expect to be alone in his study, uninterrupted, almost whenever he is in there means a lot to him . I know how vital ""time alone"" is to my husband (does your family actually understand how non-negotiable solitude is for you???). And there are times when I absolutely need to discuss something (being a recovering Borderline Personality Disordered hoomin). The fact that I know he hears me when I need to talk has, seemingly counter-intuitively, caused me to need him far, FAR less. You cannot fake this with women, nor with children. It seems to me you won't be able to give your family ""quality you"", consiste
ntly, without first having stored considerable ""solitude fat"". Somehow, they need to know this, that this is not some perverse whim of yours, but how you are made . They need to know that you will have little to give unless you feel whole, and that it's possible you might even break if you are both deprived of solitude for too long and forced to socialize with your wife's family too much . My computer is in the living room, and it can irritate me a lot when my husband is in the kitchen, but he is in no way controlling, nosy, or invasive, so I mentally have to tell myself to stop tensing up. My husband is not like my mother, my grandmother, or any number of control-freak a**h*les with whom I've worked and spent time over the years. Open communication of fundamental needs is vital. One thing for which I'm truly grateful is that my husband's family was respectful and non-invasive. Consequently, I LOVED my late in-laws and miss them dearly. This was something which I never would have thought possible. I dated o
ther people--remarkable people--whose families were part of the package, and that was too much for me. The mere word, ""family"", make me sick."

175956947,"I did. I was like ""I didn't see you for a while cuz lately have been bad at expressing the thoughts in my head"". I said ""I took one dexedrine this morning but was feeling really bad brain fog so I took the second one and felt better"". I said that my memory is bad and can't remember what happened every yesterday cuz I haven't been doing much - He said it's normal and he feels the same way like any Thursday for him can feel like a Friday. My psychiatrist talked to him and said that I was doing fairly good and that the olanzepine is really really good for me. He told my doctor to prescribe a week of 30mg Vyvanse to transition to 3 weeks of 60mg Vyvanse.. My doctor gets tired of switching the stims so I'm just gonna stay on 60mg of Vyvanse every morning. I told him that I cancelled Tuesdays appointment to go skiing but there was **** loads of people on the mountain so we turned around. I went to bed early that night to go earlier in the morning but my mom slept in and it was too cold so we went hik
ing instead. He asked if I bought presents for anyone and I did for my mom cuz she asked (A pill case for her beta blockers - Cuz she keeps forgetting to take them) but I didn't get anything for my sister. I feel bad cuz I'm not a gift person. It's a social thing for me... apathy... I feel like a psychopath sometimes but I'm just forgetful, have no idea what to buy people and procrastinate the thing.

174344056,"It sounds like you are a very caring person. I don't know exactly what you should do but if you feel like reaching out, then reach out. She will either accept it or she may be withdrawn still. Still for me, as a person with Schizoaffective disorder--depressed type, I am always happy when people reach out to me, even if I can't express it well at the time. If I am going through something I usually sleep a lot. That is how I withdraw. I don't talk a lot even when I have something to say. Sometimes I still hear voices, like yesterday, even with medication. Sometimes I see visual hallucinations too. Some are benign but others are frightening. It depends how I react to them. Sometimes they are just annoying me but I'm still focused on them and not so focused on what is real that is going on around me. Other times I am able to ignore them better but I still may not be fully able to concentrate on what is going on around me that is real because the hallucinations they seem so real. I have delusions someti
mes but they aren't about other people. Sometimes I do get paranoia though. I don't know if she will get any delusions about you. I think you know, if you are interested in her, then try to reach out. If you aren't that interested in her, then don't make it more painful and just go your own way. It is nice that you want to help her if she is in the beginning of an episode. Sometimes episodes last a long time, just so you know. Hope this helps a little. _PERSON_"

175957011,"TP, I do echo the above advice that if you (and your friend should to the same) continue to have these thoughts, that you do make your doctor/mental health professional know. This is just safe and due diligence so that neither of you gets into a more serious situation. That said, it does sound like what *you* describe (I can't say about your friend) could likely be part of an acute anxiety/OCD thought process. Your thoughts become intrusive with fear and dread of being trapped in the panic moment. It feels like you can't escape it and therefore the mind goes places... This doesn't mean you will act on it, but of course it is scary and lets you know just how challenging your anxiety is ATM. If you are not already going to therapy sessions at this time, it would be worth looking into this possibility to help you get to where you need your management to be.

This week I went to a renowned teaching university hospital, one of the best in the state. I went there to learn more about electroconvulsive therapy, also known as ECT. I am considering ECT as a treatment for my depression that comes along with my bipolar disorder. It scares me how dark depression is and how, if I want to, I can carry out various acts. Here is a rundown of ECT and how it works. I found it helpful and maybe you will too. ECT is a treatment for episodes of major depression, mania, and schizophrenia (which is right up my alley). ECT makes a brief controlled electrical current which produces a seizure in your brain. Although we do not know exactly how it works, it is believed that the seizure activity produces a chemical change in the brain which may cause symptoms to disappear. The next question I ha
d was “Is it safe?” Prior to having the procedure at this particular hospital there are medical, psychiatric, and laboratory tests conducted to assure that the procedure can be done in the safest way possible. A ECT workup will be preformed which may include a physical exam, EKG, and blood work. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/05/04/ect-and-me/"

175957053,Uppers work on me. Can’t do them. It’s the downers that don’t. I have insomnia so I take Benadryl sometimes. Works like a charm. Not the Benadryl that’s like cold medicine but the otc sleep aids that are only Benadryl like Unisom or the grocery stores brand. They are blue soft gels. Only the soft gels work not the tablets idk why.

175957059,"I have recently started wondering, if what I am considering relaxed and calm (for me) is actually anxious to the average person. You know, would the average person (by average I mean someone with out a panic or anxiety disorder) think that my not anxious state is actually still anxious compare to non anxiousers. <=I made that word up. Is there a more relaxed state of mind that exists? I have been told before I meet the criteria for anxiety and panic disorder to a T, so it makes sense reading what you posted. And it makes me think, maybe there isn't anything more out of balance in my brain, maybe I'm just 100 percent anxiety/panic."

175957065,"Hi martinez7, I think its normal to be anxious/sad in this unprecedented times. No one was prepared for this and now, we have to live (adopt) with this new norms. Why don't you try doing some activities in the evening, maybe watch some light hearted movies, talk to your trusted friends and get some exercise. Also eat food with vitamins C, D and B*. These can also affect your mental health. Just know that everyone is going through this. With enough patience, perseverance and being careful (social distance) we will get through this. -_PERSON_"

175957067,I really don’t know. I just get worried and I hear people whispering in my apartment so I assume the worst
175957068,Had an extremely awful dream I was driving home from a day at college and in my hometown and there was a huge sink hole that opened at the streetlight. All the cars sitting at the light fell in and the cars going towards it fell in. So I swerved to go through a parking lot and got to the adjoining street and stomped my breaks cuz there was a sinkhole there too. Then the dream happened again and I was a passenger in a car and we went into a sinkhole. We we’re in the center of the earth. Almost like we were in Hell. It was extremely hot down there. And everyone touching the ground there was scorched to death. I was only safe for a few min cuz we were still in the car and not touching the ground inside around us. But then the car melted and I started to feel the heat slowly. I wonder if this has anything to do with me thinking about sui last night and/or eating late cuz eating late causes me nightmares.

175957069,"It's a hard lesson we all have to learn: we have to accept that there are certain people we should not allow ourselves to ""get attached"" to. Write her a thank-you note for the help she gave you and apologize for bothering her at her new job. Tell her you understand you crossed a boundary that should not be crossed. Work with your new case worker, and work with a psychotherapist on your attachment issues. You will benefit a lot from doing these three things."
175957070,Yeah I just took one after not taking any for 2 days
175957071,"getting by: Yes, 'manipulative' is the right choice of word...I've been manipulated numerous times lol...but still, I have to press on.

Thank you for the ultra-kind words of affirmation. They mean a lot to me. Yes, she has a different persona now...thank you. From the bottom of my heart. theHTreturns: Thank you so very much too...yes love is a wonderful thing, even though there are people who think otherwise...I hope my wife finds it in herself to fight too...we'll see.

But.. The 10mg olanzepine makes me feel extremely stable.. But I want to stop taking cuz I don't feel like doing anything..
175957076,"I'd say u may need an adjustment to your medication. I've taken the same meds for years and was in a deep dark place. Couldn't get out of bed, shower, work.

175957087,"True to some extent. I feel it also has to do with networking and exposure. Getting good networks and good exposure, and you can do almost all of what u want to do artistically. Get big enough and u can do it all. I think the big thing with me and the great thing maybe, is unlike a lot of people my age or younger trying to make a few songs or books or whatever and spend some time on promotion on social media in hopes of becoming famous..... ....I’m more that I just write my heart out. Not purposely, which is weird. I absolutely cannot write like MAKE myself write. I can’t make myself do anything with depression/anxiety etc mental health issues. It’s the hypomania and rare mania that keeps me writing. That and my compulsions that my therapist says I have a lot of. She says I have really bad compulsions. I agree. If I’m hypo and I start writing, I can’t stop. That’s why I bought that book called hypergraphia. I could swear I have that issue. Many times I find it hard to stop writing. And 
then there are my down days. What I was gonna say tho is, I think the good thing about me is that my focus isn’t necessarily at being at the top of the chain but rather spreading wide. Spreading my work widely instead of looking up. Because I’ve tried to be at the top and it’s a standstill to get there. But when I work “outwards” I’m seeing all these people come to ME."

175957110,"You said in your first post, ""suspect that my wife may be Borderline Personality Disorder or merely suffering from what I can only describe as sudden onset anxiety."" And later you mentioned possibly bipolar, which is what I have. 1. Sudden Onset Anxiety mayo clinic says: “Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations).” 2. Bipolar (mayo clinic): Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating. As manic: • Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired; Increased activity, energy or agitation: Exaggerated se
nse of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria); Decreased need for sleep: Unusual talkativeness; Racing thoughts: Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments. 3. Borderline Personality Disorder (nih.gov): People with borderline personality disorder may experience mood swings and display uncertainty about how they see themselves and their role in the world. As a result, their interests and values can change quickly. People with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their opinions of other people can also change quickly. An individual who is seen as a friend one day may be considered an enemy or traitor the next. These shifting feelings can lead to intense and unstable relationships. Other signs or symptoms may include: • Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, such as rapidly initiating intimate (physical or emotional) relationships or cutting off communication with someon
e in anticipation of being abandoned • A pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family, friends, and loved ones, often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation); Distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self • Impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, such as spending sprees, unsafe sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge eating: Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days • Chronic feelings of emptiness; Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger You said about your wife: “The problem is this type of behavior is not limited to me. She will overtly overlay anger on anyone where she will not receive an immediate consequence, e.g. someone at work. But she will distance herself from that person extensively. Two years ago she developed such angst with co-workers she began to telework, thus avoiding the office entirely. She has been estranged from her mother fo
r five years. When she ends any ""relationship"" there is a complete severance of contact. I have several times intervened and convinced her sometimes the conflict with her friend/parent/coworker might simply be a miscommunication often this will work out--until she perceives some slight unintended or not. She can be extreme in her anger and can go from being an affectionate laughing wife.... to full-blown anger in one sentence.” You mentioned she has fear of abandonment, which applies to Borderline. Which of those 3 do you think she is?"

With the measures in place now (trying to mitigate not eliminate) once these restrictions are lifted, we resume normal life cautiously, but this virus is not going to disappear. It may spread at a much slower rate but it is not disappearing. I am sure at some point we are all going to get it. I am very worried it appears as though no one knows how they are going to respond.

175957121,"Life is wonderful, you know, and I keep reaching for new heights, but idk. Sometimes it feels like I’ll be stuck in the same position for ever. Same job, same place, same same finances, same clothes etc everything the same. And it scares me. The only thing I can seem to enjoy is the same people. Very few material things I enjoy for years. Even less for decades. And maybe one or two items in my lifetime I’ll ever keep liking. I’ve always kinda been that way. It was how I grew up. I always got new stuff when I just asked. Even without asking. It’s gotten better for sure. But, after I started to recover from psychosis, lack of change scared me. It scared me, because for me it meant staying in psychosis and the same mental state. I’m always looking now for new ways to engage my brain. Good thing is, things have gotten better with “stuff”. I may put something down for months but I’ll always go back and pick it up like nothings changed. I just need breaks in life with things and situation

175957124,I do think it prevents getting services and it’s such a shame. Last year I had to get an emergency infusion in the hospital and they charged me 6000 dollars and if it wasn’t life threatening I might’ve thought twice about getting it at the time because of how much work it was to get charity care because I couldn’t afford it due to certain physical and mental capacities.. a service that would be helpful in the long run for sure...I’m 31 and struggling to get disability. I have a dibiltating auto immune plus a few mental daily struggles that will only get worse as I age. Some days it’s hard to walk on my ankle joint. I worry and can’t imagine where I’ll be in 20 years from now. I had mentioned in the first post due to abuse I almost lost my home in the beginning of the pandemic and I truest felt that no one out there cared no matter how many hotlines or numbers I called.

175957134,"Hi. This is an issue I no longer deal with, but I want to know if I was suffering from delusions in middle school. A few years ago, I had my first (potentially second, but first major) episode of depression. It was awful- I was in constant anguish, crying myself to sleep, thinking I was a burden on everyone, stopped doing almost all schoolwork, argued frequently with my dad/ was irritable, woke up wishing I hadn't, and had [email protected] thoughts, and all of that. But I'm wondering if I also suffered from delusions/psychosis. My dad and I had a relationship strain because of my mental health. I was doing and saying crazy things that Iam embarassed to have done now. My thoughts were so distorted, and I was not myself at all. I hated EVERYONE, called them ""sheep"", etc. My ""delusions"", if that's what they were, were: Thinking that I had a ""psychic connection"" to my mother (whom I haven't seen since I was little), like that she was psychically sending messages to me that she was dead, or that 
she missed me. I also thought that other people in my class (only the boys, strangely) could read my mind. I had to monitor my thoughts constantly to make sure I wasn't thinking anything embarassing, gross, or otherwise ""judge-able"" (lack of better term). This is actually something that began in 6th grade. If I thought something about a boy in my class I would get paranoid that he heard what I said psychically. Last, I had a selusion of suffering from a condition I wasn't. I thought I had a speech impediment; I've never had one at all. I kept most of these delusions to myself- I told no one that I thought people could read my mind or that I thought I had a cosmic psychic connection to my estranged mother, but I told people about the speech impediment one. I no longer suffer from these thoughts, but do you think I was delusional/psychotic? I was pretty crazy back then. It wasn't my first battle with mental health issues but it was definitely my worst. Thank you for listening, sorry for rambling."

175957136,"As for giving any thought to seeing a psychiatrist for your anxiety, you said, “I have yes.” And, “I do have meds for anxiety but I haven’t changed anything since my sister’s attempt.” You may have short term medicine to get you through the next few hours, but maybe you need a long term anti-anxiety medicine which could lower the anxiety so you don’t have the anxiety flareups. I think you should at least talk to a psychiatrist to hear what they have to say about your situation. Also, you may want to be checking on your sister to see if she is seeing somebody for emotional problems."
175957137,"Yeah, for sure. This reminds me a lot of how I felt when I had a badass pneumonia in '92. Feels very similar to that, but I don't seem to really be sick otherwise. _PERSON_, man. It's weird."

Four US states have now abolished the insanity defense, Utah, _NAME_, Idaho, and Kansas. Not surprising. Really, here in the US, even in the liberal states, people who assert the insanity defense are still punished, often severely, just as though they had not, in fact, been insane at time of offense. So, they make it available, kind of, but really, they are still gonna punsih you just like pretty much any other person. The details will be different, but punished, you shall be. With an insanity ""conviction,"" so they can use their most favoritest word in the lannguage--conviction. This situation illustrates the confusion in the thinking. If you truly believed someone should not be held responsible for stabbing someone while psychotic, then, what is the need for punishment based on? How do those two add up? For me, they do not. I
t is confusion, playing both sides at the same time. Treatment? Sure, obviously. But punishment? Why? For what? As a deterrent? You think punishing a manic gal who ran naked down Broadway after God commanded her to is going to be deterred from doing that again because we arrest her? This shows you know not one thing about mental illness. Anyhow, love and hugs!!!!!!!!!!"

175957145,I’m a woman early 30s my health anxiety rules my life. I’ve been petrified of _NAME_ angiomas ever since I read a scary article in 2017 saying that if you have them especially on breast’s is means you have high estrogen and that it’s estrogen attacking blood vessels. Many other American drs say they are harmless but this article was traditional Chinese medicine and I worry he was right. I’ve had tons of my arms for years now stating to get them in breats and I’m a wreck about as far as I know I’ve never been told I had high estrogen. Also I have one under my tongue for two years and I worry cause I’ve never heard of anyone getting them there is it not normal. I’m just a wreck and any help you could give me would really help. I hope they really are harmless and not what article said

The environment is also nice and supportive, full of people above 30, probably that’s why. Some of them are really amazing painters but there are also newbies like me. I know landscape will be my specialty, I don’t want to draw portrait at all it looks boring to me, too technical and lack of imagination."
175957149,"My mom woke up and is feeling much better. Her head doesn't hurt nearly as much and she just needed a good sleep and slept deeply. She works so hard and then exercises on her days off which I've been telling her that isn't good. I slept in her bed all night with the cats so she didn't feel alone. I have no certainty about anything so I'm gonna make the Ether wallet, maybe meditate and read PiHKAL. I took both of the Vyvanses at noon so I'll be up until ~1am or so. I went to the grocery store to buy coffee. _AT_MENTION_, coffee is a great thing to give up for lent because it's so good - The smell, wakefulness, preparing it.. The most used drug in the world. You'll appreciate it much better after 40 days. Imagine how I quit things - I don't get cravings except maybe once or twice a month and they only last 10 minutes."

Don't think it'll be an issue."

I see...must have been rather shocking in the initial stages for you and your husband. Hold on...you also run away from your husband...? If you don't mind me asking, may I know how often and for how long each time...? Like maybe...once a year and for a few weeks at a time perhaps...? When you're away, do you engage in high-risk activities like random sex? (Sorry...too much reading of Internet articles and worried that my wife might encounter unsavoury characters) Oh no worries, my wife was/is exactly the same...when I first got her out of IMH (after being warded 30 days), she told me that she wanted to write a book and started typing on her laptop every day furiously...same old lol. The guilt is normal and natural. Kudos to you, my friend

Alas, if only my wife could one day come to her senses and approach me, I would do all I can to help her... : _ / Reason, sanity and kindness gone...yeah it sounds all too familiar. I'm not blaming her at all, far from it. I know the illness is an insidious enemy that lurks and pounces at unexpecting timings... Yeah I do know I have to be healthy and strong for her and for myself...thanks AppleBlossom...I will try my best not to over-ruminate and just focus on keeping myself sane and healthy...after all, it's going to be a long journey (maybe 35-40 more years?) and I can't let a small bump on the road demoralise me. There was a period of time when my wife went vegan for a year or so and she became very sick after that cos' her immunity collapsed due to the lack of nutrients from meat and so on. Not sure if it's like that for everyone or just a select few. You ran because of the fear of being alone...hmm...it does sound peculiar...I guess I'll never 
fully understand how the Bipolar/Schizo-affective(wife might be this) mind works...I'll just do my best to be there for my wife in whatever way possible. Ok got it...as in the list. If she ever comes back, I will be a lot more vigilant. Thanks for the tips...truly appreciate it. May God watch over you, _NAME_ and theHTreturns for being exceedingly kind to me.

I take abilify and it works well for me. It works as a mood stabilizer and it has really helped. I have never taken Cymbalta, though I take a similar, Pristiq (and 5mg of Lexapro). Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't need either of them? I hope things get leveled out soon. Have a good day. Hugs, _NAME_..."
174344323,"My pdoc prescribed Vraylar today. I guess I just go down on the Abilify for now, so it's one change at a time. Then next week I think I start taking the Vraylar. I need to confirm this with him tomorrow, the exact directions. Anyway, I am a little hesitant to switch. But Zyprexa causes my weight to change. So I don't know. Though Zyprexa really does control my mood and stabilizes it a ton. So I don't know!!!! It's so hard to make these treatment-related decisions!"

175957161,"Thanks <3 I agree that these thoughts aren't who we are but they weren't intrusive OCD thoughts this time - More just frustrated and disconnected from reality which still isn't me. I cried on and off for about an hour and never felt emotions from the past like that before. I felt like I was still a kid, in the future crying about what has happened. I think it could be the microdose. The non-psychoactive shroom dose was trying to tell me something and allowing me to express my emotions. I was very good at expressing myself poetically and such.. Watching the news - Just extremely overwhelmed and regretting how much time I've wasted doing nothing until now. I only take a microdose once a week to strengthen my mind and prevent panic attacks. I tried another dose today because for the second day in a row and I feel a bit of DP/DR so I took the olanzepine early and 0.25mg clonazepam. I went for a walk with my sister today and told her about everything. What I'm doing is extremely complicated to me - The 
offline ether wallet and crypto messages, piecing together my life and understanding the chemicals and family relationships, etc.. I thought about meditating today which I might but I'm going to watch a movie with my mom. Things are ok... I'm just impatient.."

175957169,I was like you for 2 years . My condition was so terrible. It was so scary. Finally I went to inpatient to get help 6 months ago.

I have a cat who is the sweetest cat in the world to me but she hates everyone but me and she does attack people, so I have to put her in the screen porch or another room when people come over. I end up getting extremely anxious because I feel so terrible for her and also I feel kind of embarrassed because I feel like people don't understand. She's just trying to protect us and her territory. I'm glad I am not the only one who gets anxious in these types of situations because I feel kind of dumb for feeling that way."

175957182,"Hi all, I'm in my mid forties, male, diagnosed in the sense that health care professionals say I have traits of ASD or Schizoid Personality. The diagnostic criteria are a semi-fit, but the subjective experience talked about on this forum and elsewhere is a close match to my life. Until I was in my late teens and early twenties, I didn't feel any real need to be connected to other people. I was good at what I was good at - mainly debating and computers - and I spent time reading when other people talked. At university I realised that I did actually want to feel connected to other people, but I had not idea how to go about it. It felt like everyone else had a natural instinct for engaging with each other - it wasn't just that I lacked the skills, but that I lacked the impulses that drove the execution of those skills. I spent a lot of time reading academic work about social interaction, but it didn't help. Ever since, I've alternated between depression, obsession with trying to get relationships righ
t, periods where I'm relatively calm and complacent about successfully imitating normal, and times where I deeply resent having to pretend to be someone that I am not in order to maintain connections that are never as close as I want them to be. Most of the time I am now reasonably socially functional. I have an academic career - a job that requires far more social interaction than any of the stereotypes suggest - and I am married with children. I feel that I spend most of my time in roles where ""success"" means that I am managing to impersonate an average person, and hardly any time being myself. I'm tempted to write a book with explicit instructions on how to impersonate being a normal person, just in case it is useful to anyone. I have a massive library of scripts and routines, and rules of thumb on when to execute each one. Page one of the book would say ""Here's the book you've always suspected that everyone else had uploaded to their brains before birth. If you really, really want to pretend to be norm
al, this is how to do it. The knowledge is dangerous. Humans are very strange people, and you will never be one of them. Use with extreme caution."" If I get into just the right mood, I can enjoy social interaction like it is a game that I can play well - enjoyable because I'm doing something I'm good at, and because it helps other people for me to be good at it, but not because it's what I would do by choice. I've just come through another cycle of depression, and I've realised how much pressure I'm putting on myself with my job and family, and not nearly enough time alone. My wife sort of understands how much time I need, but she switches quickly from being willing to consider ways of compromising, to thinking that if I need to spend time away from my family, that we aren't properly married. It doesn't help that her family and extended family is unusually insistent on regularly catching up, and she sees that as the norm, rather than something right at one end of a spectrum where I am at the other. I'm going 
active on the forum just in case other people have good strategies for creating space to be alone, in the same way that I used to wish there was a guide for doing the social interaction stuff. I need time that is just me in my own spaces, but I always need more than I can get. My family is afraid that if they help me get more time alone, I'll just want even more - I can't say that they are wrong, because I need a lot more than I get, and a small taste just shows me how under-aloned I am."

175957186,"I’m glad you’re thinking about taking your medicine. You say you’re positive, but you make a list of upsets and make statements which suggest that might not be true, in my view. I can write a list of my defeats for you, and a lot of them happened before I read a column on being positive. I was raised in a negative household, and I have bipolar (for which I take Lithium and Mirtazapine anti-depressant), so negative thinking could be one of those or both. I didn’t think I was negative, either, I just thought I was being more practical than others, more honest. I was really just following the tone set in my growing up household before I had a chance to make decisions on my own. For one of those defeats on my list, I distinctly remember my conscious had the solution, but my negative unconscious muddled the works by saying, “That won’t work, because….” And came up with some silly, untrue reason which had me thinking half positive and half negative, and fouled up the works. I realized I h
ad to get my negative unconscious in line with my positive conscious. If one thought negative (unconscious) and one thought positive (conscious) I was going to be in trouble. And I stumbled across a column in the newspaper which solved that issue. It said, before you go into a problem, believe that you can solve. What that does is get both our conscious and our unconscious believing we can solve it, and it frees up both parts of the mind to look for the solution. Rather than, having the unconscious (negative upbringing) looking for reasons why the problem can’t be solved. I so believed in this column, and the woman who wrote it, that I clipped it out and put it on my bulletin board. I told myself, the next time you have a problem, don’t think about the column, but first read the column on being positive to get your mind going in the right direction. It was a two-step process. The first step was getting the negative out of my unconscious, which I couldn’t see and never knew if it was fouling me up. Since 
I can’t see it, let’s clear it out of any hidden negative thinking before we even think about the problem. It’s like mine-sweeping our brain. What was the next problem? My son comes in and says the car's in the backyard and it won’t start. Well, too much problem for me, because we have a small twisting driveway and a big wrecker won’t get into it. I thought, I’ll wait until my wife gets home and she’ll solve the problem. Then I thought, wait, I was supposed to read the column on being positive before I tried to solve my next problem. I got the column down and started reading it. By the 4th paragraph I thought, “_NAME_’s.” What was _NAME_’s? It was a garage up the street that had a small wrecker which could get into our small driveway and a couple of years ago had gotten one of our cars. How had I solved the problem and I wasn’t even thinking about it? By reading the column, my unconscious had been cleared of negative, and it was seeking the answer while I read the column. From then on, 
whenever I was away from the column and had a problem, I would consciously try to clear my unconscious of any negative by saying over and over, “Think positive, think positive, think positive.” And only then start thinking about the problem. It’s a two-step process. Notice, this method only requires being positive for 30 seconds when trying to solve a problem. It doesn’t require you to be positive all day long or to completely change your personality. You can still be yourself. Also, not only do we affect ourselves when we think negative about solving problems, it affects those around us. There could be some people who are depending on us for help, so thinking negative also affects them. That’s not fair. It, too, can affect others who can imitate our negative thinking."

175957189,"I was kind of the opposite. Most of my early to mid 20s were hypomanic (or maybe manic?

Our doctors don’t let us retest so we are not certain if we are 100% now. He has a very minor cough and I feel a bit of discomfort in my throat. I asked my doctor if that meant I still had it and was able to pass it, all she said was based on the CDC I was not contagious anymore. Today my bf kissed me. I freaked out !

Hopefully it will get better after I hit my 1 year anniversary in January. Having a few hallucinations and possibly some delusions. IDK delusions are harder for me to tell but usually when I have thoughts like what I'm having people tell me they're delusions so I think probably it is. It doesn't really help to know that, it just is what it is. See my T on Saturday so I'll probably talk about some of this stuff with her. It will be 3 weeks since I've seen her. I kind of miss her. But I'm not in crisis so that's good. Spent the weekend mostly doing Church stuff. And then I read a book on Saturday. Kind of a crappy book but I was able to read! Usually my AP keeps me from reading. So I was pretty excited I read a book cover to cover. It wasn't too long. Maybe like 200 pages. But still. yeah me! Doing okay mostly. Just chilling

175957211,"Yeah, you're right. You said in your original post: ""She can be extreme in her anger and can go from being an affectionate laughing wife.... to full-blown anger in one sentence."" You then say in your most recent post: ""In the final analysis people with true BPD live with a hyperactive _USER_ID_, or so I am told. This then seems to give false alarms of danger and false alarms of the seriousness of provocation...."" about the condition you mentioned, hyperactive _USER_ID_, Inside the brain .com says: ""Now scientists at the University of California, Berkeley have discovered a neural explanation for why some individuals are indeed more anxiety-prone than others. Their findings, published in Neuron, reveal that chinks in our brain circuitry could be the answer, and may pave the way for more targeted treatment of chronic fear and anxiety disorders. In the brain imaging study, the researchers discovered two distinct neural pathways that play a role in whether we develop and overcome fears. The first i
nvolves an overactive _USER_ID_, which is home to the brain’s primal fight-or-flight reflex and plays a role in developing specific phobias."" So, my wife had borderline personality disorder, I do believe, but she didn't have the quick to anger. Now she had anger, pathological anger, but it would mostly be due to an event that threatened her. But I didn't know about the ""hyperactive _USER_ID_."" So that sounds like what it is.

175957277,"Hello guys, hope you are having a good day so far. I've been struggling today: depression and delusions--although I'm not giving into the delusions, I keep blocking them out so that's good. I think the depression is from the delusions and struggling to know what is real. The stress was enough this morning to cause me to throw up but that happens a lot these days. I rested on the couch for most of the morning because getting sick takes a lot out of me. THen I got up about 12:30, I think, showered, started the laundry and began journaling which has helped my mood a lot. (So did texting a bit with my sister.) I should practice some DBT today, too, as that is always soothing. I should have done that this morning but I guess I was so out of it I didn't think to. Despite the struggles with ""reality"" I had a nice visit with my family yesterday. It was a bit sad though because my mother has dementia and really had no awareness of Mother's Day and what it means. We gave her some gorgeous, pop-up paper flo
wers (she can't care for fresh ones) and they did make her smile, which is good, but that was about the only reaction we got. Still, she seemed to be in a good mood all evening which is something. She picked out what she wanted for dinner--we do DoorDash--and she seemed to enjoy what she got. Later we watched a TV mystery show we have been watching regularly during out visits. I'm going to stay proactive and keep confronting my symptoms--journaling, practicing DBT, practicing gratitude. I hope everyone here has an ""arsenal"" that they can use to combat their illness. Hang in there everybody, _PERSON_"
175957278,"Hi AK, I am sorry that you are feeling anxious about your upcoming trip. It is not unusual to feel anxiety during happy/positive experiences because our brains often don't differentiate between stimuli...in other words, any event, good or bad that causes us intense emotions/feelings can register as stress. Add to that the change in routine, and the added unknown factors of travel...and you have several triggers for those of us who are challenged with anxiety! Try not to be frustrated with yourself, but rather be proud that you are willing to face your fears and go anyway. That is a huge win! Many people choose not to... I really think, like me, most of your worry is anticipatory...and that once you get there, you'll have a wonderful time. 'Pack' your best coping skills of course, and work them daily! You can do this! Have a wonderful trip, and post as needed...we'll be here if need be. (but I bet you won't need us!) S.C."

175957282,"Please read the attached article. You are absolutely right. There is no getting over it, not a time when you won't feel it or it won't affect you. The tips mentioned in the article aren't for ""getting over it"" but getting through, which will still be an individual process depending on the person. You are not ""failing"" at life by grieving in your own way. And all these suggestions are for anybody in these types of situations. Please also note the wonderful comfort at the bottom where it talks about the resurrection hope. There are Scriptures cited there that you could look up in your own Bible and read about the wonderful time when you will be able to See, Touch, and Hug your beautiful son again. This is what God has promised us. Please when you get a moment, I hope you can find some comfort and peace, even if for just a few minutes.

175957295,"Hey! I understand that you are going through a lot right now and I think I may have a solution for you! Focus on the things around you, the things that rely on and love you. For example, your daughter. Show the people that look down on you that you can do so much more but don’t do it for yourself. Do it for your daughter because with depression you don’t care if you let yourself down. But when it comes to other people the odds are better! In my case it became an obsession but there have been no problems! When people tell you that you are not worthy and that you are a burden don’t just take it. Talk back, be bold, show them that you are strong because you are. If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

She doesn't want to see me even thou, just 2 weeks ago she was dying to see me 2) Ukraine, esp.our regoin is still in quarantine.

175957308,"I am also having a lot of anxiety about the new coronavirus. I am trying not to read all of the articles, but it's hard to avoid the headlines. I've tried learning about it in order to get my fears in check but that hasn't helped either as there isn't a lot known about the virus or how it works. I'm relying heavily on my xanax prescription, reading fiction, and keeping myself as busy as I can. It's not just you, this is tough for any of us who deal with health anxiety. I think the best we can do right now is practice our grounding and calming techniques, make healthy choices, wash our hands when necessary and try to keep calm.... And come here, on this forum, as much as we need to for support."

I’m trying to hold on until the 8 week mark on 10mg but it’s been hard. I’m still not feeling well and have minimal improvement."

174344506,"If I were you I would keep a journal. Write in everything that happens that concerns her. Example: it's her dads weekend and he's a no call no show. Write that. OR; He's supposed to pick her up at school and is late. Write that. By doing this, when she starts asking questions you can tell her that you've kept a journal of her growing up. That some of it you might not like. I've done my best to keep it updated on a daily basis (which is best, that way you don't forget anything). I wrote this for you so you could go back and read about your growing up years. I did this for my oldest son. He had behavioral issues growing up and was diagnosed as having bipolar and schizophrenia. My youngest son I wrote something similar to an autobiography. They both liked what I had wrote for them. They also appreciated the time I took each night to write in their books. If nothing of importance happened I wrote about how their behavior was and that I was proud of them. My boys had different fathers as I left my first 
husband when I was pregnant with my oldest son. So I have a daughter and son by my first. But when their dad pulled a no call no show I wrote something like; today is April 30th and your dad didn't show up to pick you and your sister up for the weekend so I cancelled our plans to go out of town so we can have a family day tomorrow. We will all vote to wether we go on a picnic or fishing. This way I'm not bad mouthing their dad, and turned it into something more of a positive. When kids are old enough they will know the truth of what happened and that you did your best to make it better for them. I hope this helps you. _NAME_"

They are Bluetooth, water resistant, 10 hour battery life, works with phone, take an hour and a half to charge, there the ANKERS slim+ f04 $30 bucks.. Today I used them. THEY ARE AMAZING! I absolutely love them. Thank god they are awesome! I recommend them to anyone.

175957332,"Hi SS and welcome! I am sorry to hear that you are struggling with anxiety and what sounds like some really challenging hormonal issues currently. I know how difficult this must be. It is great to hear that you are already a good way through your start up period with your Zoloft. You should start noting benefits soon, so keep up the good work and stay positive that things will improve. As far as the connection with your cycle and anxiety goes...have you talked to your OBGYN about the possibility of PPMD, or perimenopausal/hormonal imbalance issues. If not, this might be worth discussing. For now please see our Resources at the top of the main forum page here for great self help material that will make a difference if practiced daily. _PERSON_ posting with us as well if you find it helpful. We care, understand and support us key! _PERSON_ Cat"

175957336,"MV, Hopefully tomorrow night will serve as a distraction rather than added stress. I often find socializing helpful for my mood, even if I initially have to force myself to do it. As far as the self harm...is your therapist aware that this is happening? I ask because it does concern me of course, and also because you may benefit from a PRN (taken as needed) Rx for times when your anxiety is so acute. A benzo is not a daily medication, but one that may be just right in order to help you when you have those urges to lash out on yourself. Talk to him or her if you need to have this conversation. Peace and progress my friend. We are encouraging you, and here when you need us. Let us know how you are doing soon. S.C."

I'm gonna cold turkey xanax 0.5mg a night, take 1g phenibut tomorrow. I'll take 50mg Seroquel tonight - Maybe the palpitations were all in my head. More suffering. I'm becoming a zombie. I just want a simple life now. Yet I don't want a relationship. I just want to be great, travel, have a fun life. The soldiers and crypto investor guy didn't give me support - They put me down. I don't know how putting me down fixes me. I keep thinking about what they said all the time and can't get it out of my head.. About my anhedonia, everything. That's why I never talked to anyone when I was a teenager. I was afraid of getting hurt. I remember people in the psych ward would say sorry when they told me to do things.. And I did them.. They said ""Sorry don't mean to boss you around"". I didn't get what they meant - Now I realize that doing tasks for people i
s my automatic reaction because my ex step dad bossed me around all day every day. I can't believe how horribly I was manipulated.. By everyone.. I'm really damaged. Psychedelics just make me realize that this is all a sick twisted dream.. To look on the bright side but when I feel happy, it feels fake. My mind is too open - Things are really really bad. And I didn't become a stronger person with all this horrible stuff that happened to me? I should have become a stronger person by now - But I feel weak and paralysed. I've continued to put immense pressure on myself since two nights ago when I said that I shouldn't - It's the only way for me to be. It's not like I can get a girlfriend or boyfriend and get admiration from people like some grand theft auto or sims game. ""Oh you're getting married how wonderful"". Even though I would treat someone better than most, I have no desire. I rarely get excited about things like food (Dessert for example).. It feels fake.. I don't like impressing people.. It just feels 
fake.. I don't like expecting things or surprises because I can predict everything. Everyone I know is predictable. Nothing shocks me - Possible trigger: It's all the same monotone train of **** that I want to jump under to end it all."

I feel somewhat lethargic and just wanna sit and stare at the wall. I feel restless. Not wanting to actually do something but not wanting to relax. My mind is ok kinda, but my body feels tired. I get like this every weekend tho. And then halfway through Sunday (about) I start to catch a second wind of motivation. It’s like my body knows i won’t be doing anything on the weekends, as usual, so it sorta just shuts down and goes into sleepy/lethargic mode."

I was probably going the wrong way half the time before I realized they were there because I haven't gone shopping since over a month ago and they weren't there last time. Glad that's over with.

175957370,"I had another argument with that relative again. She sent me stuff and then asks me if I've gotten it constantly. Then my mother must have told her I haven't called in weeks and she's like ""what's wrong with you!"" I'm like I've been afraid to, which is the absolute truth. So she says something like ""are you afraid to get the packages, too, or do you just not care?"" She was being snotty. I said both. She said she won't send me anything anymore and I said thank you. Then I blacklisted her. When I blacklisted her on Tues or Wed, she called me on the phone and I had to answer. Even though I really really really wasn't ready to unblacklist her.

I think honestly one of the more damaging questions was beyond my control they asked if in a few years whether I’d want to work part time or full and I said full but her face changed so I think they were hoping I could fill one of their part time positions down the road. But there were other basic questions like in your research on the library what stood out to you. Even do you have any questions for us. I had to pause and then foot in mouth occurred. Basically I wasn’t prepared because I was trying not to be nervous that I didn’t prep too much last night. But on the plus side it’s done and I’m better prepared if I for the next interview and you never know."

So I gotta redo it haha. 2 seasons have passed since I bought mine. Haha. There’s like 30 or so pages tho and it’s a small sketchbook. Like the size of a to-go planner. You could put it in a purse/bag but I love it. And if u buy the digital part of it, they will scan your pictures and put them on their online library, and whenever someone views your online library or in-person checks out your book, you will get a text message saying someone looked at your sketchbook. Plus a whole bunch of other things. It’s really cool. I may do poetry in my next one."
175957386,It took me 14 years to get the right Dx. If you don't want medication I'd be upfront and get a therapist that is willing to work with you. None of my T's have been willing to work with me unmedicated and pdocs want me in therapy.

175957388,"_NAME_, Thanks. There's a situation I could have avoided and didn't, but who knows? I knew better, though. Other than work or the doctor, I guess I won't go anywhere else until I'm vaccinated. It was upsetting that she wouldn't even concede that it could have come from somewhere else. She works at a long-term care facility and employees come in and out. Her son goes to her dad's. She makes a ton of bad decisions. She hasn't said much about it lately, but I just don't want to talk to her much about this. She gets angry when I go to Facebook for support instead of her, so that's part of the reason I'm here. You had displasia before? I guess mine is benign, but COULD turn into cancer? I've decided to do my best to avoid foods and beverages that knowingly increase reflux, at least until the next ablation as to not worsen the situation. I need to shed some weight anyways.

175957400,How are you feeling today _AT_MENTION_?
175957401,"No. People who say those things assume that normalcy will cure whatever issues you have. They interpret your failure to conform as the reason for those issues, rather than the other way around. It's not a call to action, it's an expression of disapproval just barely disguised as a call to action. The assumptions and expectations involved are completely misguided. There's a strong connotation that you're just failing to do something perfectly well-known (""being normal""), when the main thing you really need to deal with is figuring out something unknown (""being you"", sustainably). Normalcy isn't inherently bad (it's normal for a reason), but when the recipe chronically wears you down instead of building you up, you need to look critically at every aspect of it. There's nothing that you can ""just"" do about it, and that's what that commonplace attitude (""just toughen up"", ""just enjoy it"") fails to capture. Because it's based on a value judgement (""it should be trivial"") that clashes with th
e reality (""it isn't trivial""). I agree. But that's actually opposite to that typical ""toughen up"" attitude I was talking about (which actually implies ""following the herd"" as the solution instead). I'm just not sure if people actually ever switch from ""externally-oriented"" to ""internally-oriented"". It's something that can be emulated to a degree, and that can be helpful, but fundamental change, I tend to doubt it from what I've seen personally. What can definitely be changed though is if you've learned to emulate enternal orientation. It can be unlearned."
175957402,"Hi TMo, I get anxiety prior to, but once I get on the road I feel better. I think mine is more anticipation on leaving. Not really sure but I can sympathize with you. To me a 3-4 hour drive would be next to impossible. I have to drive an hour to see my psychologist and it nearly kills me. I ache so bad from sitting in one spot for so long. I have fibromyalgia though and my muscles ache. If you made the 4 hour drive, I know you can do 3 hrs and 45min. And I think seeing your grandfather will be delightful. Just remember we never know what is going to happen tomorrow and seeing family is a good thing. Even if you might not really want to see people, keep it brief. I know you got this. And you wont regret it. Nothing bad is going to happen. Hang in there. Have a lovely day... Hugs, _NAME_..."

175957423,"During this semester, I took a class where many had told me it was challenging; not the first time this has happened and usually what I did was study harder and I would join study groups and go to the school's tutoring which would help me immensely but due to covid-19, everything has shifted online, as for many. Given the current conditions, I know that I am blessed to have a roof over my head, enough food and a stable internet connections and I am very aware that a lot of people are worse than me but given this class and only this class in particular, I have been crying all week. Because these are online classes and my school in particular wasn't prepared for this at all in terms of tests, its understandable that tests would be harder since now we have access to more info for the tests even though we get sent emails where using these would mean academic dishonesty. The course is already hard as it is and now we have extreme time limits and they change the wording on purpose, meaning we are given m
any many practice exercises and the wording, for obvious reasons, is changed but the problem is that it is changed so much that for instance in my case I spend half of the time just trying to understand many the questions, and we basically have 15 minutes each to answer each one and send a picture of our response meaning in my opinion, professors are not acknowledging the fact that the difficulty level is increased and that we can't do the tests as fast as before. I do not intend for that my grade to be just given to me, I have learned throughout my life that only the things that you work for have value, but I feel this is too extreme; they took away one of our tests, meaning that instead of having x tests we now have x-1, because of a lack of time for them to grade which I get, and according to them there is no way to substitute that grade and this was told to us after taking the second test, which came to a complete shock to us. Also, on the first online test we were given thankfully an option to spend any 
amount of time on a certain question but a restricted overall time, but given those particular questions, some of us didn't even have time to upload some pictures (which on this case it played an important role on my grade on the test), which according to the professors, was our lack of time management skills. At this point I understand this, and agree to a certain extent, even though I was clearly affected by this, but what really threw me off was their attitude afterwards, especially in the way my professor delivered the last announcement. For the final test, now we can't scroll through the test, meaning that our time management will be worse. Also, my professor in particular does not tell us the average score or the grade distribution but another student (given that these are departamental tests) had told me that their professor had displayed it, and the average score was F for all of the tests we had taken individually, and I believe this doesn't come to a surprise to the professors at this point since I 
know about of a lot of people have had to repeat this and other courses of the department throughout the years consequentially. (Side note, they changed part of the grading curve this semester and it affects me (meaning on other years my letter grade would be higher) which makes me kinda sad and mad) But honestly what threw me off the most was my mother. This situation is very painful to me and I know that I have to strive for a better grade, I don't want to fail or if my pass in a way that my GPA would take an impact, but at this point I have felt so defeated and having her yell and degrade me truly hurts the most, and having her tell me consequently that I am irresponsable an immature about this, that I should only study harder because all of these grades are my fault hurts me more than anything else since this is the way she has always reacted when I fail of decrease my skill in something even though she knows I do well and above average in most of my classes and other life challenges and that sometimes I 
just need a bit of love, not more pressure. I know I need to work harder, but right now I feel worse than before. I didn't do hot on my first test, which is completely normal for me since I have an adjustment period for the course but having to study as hard as I did for the latter ones and see that my grade has barely changed and that on top of the current events and the polar change in the test format, I feel crushed. Right now I can't concentrate; everything that seemed hard now seems impossible and I can't think straight. Now when I don't get things, I go on full panic mode since I know that this test is so crucial. I also have other issues, like the fact that repeating the class (which right now I am passing by a hair but still would hit my GPA like a truck) would just delay my degree, besides of issues in my personal life and some other classes, which thankfully are less and most importantly, manageable. At this point, it just feels like I have to fight so much and as I'm losing mental strength, there i
s no way to replenish it in a way to help me get on my feet and fight stronger for this class. Watching YouTube, movies, and _NAME_ talks hasn't helped me which really bums me out since its the first time that I can't find that pick me up by myself. I want to pass and get an amazing grade and most importantly work for it, but I feel as if I am rushing myself too much or not having adequate tools or outlets for me to progress. Sorry for the extremely long post, its just that I needed to vent"

175957426,"I wouldn’t be surprised if ur diagnosis is correct from what u say the length of time is with ur up and down moods. I’m definitely Borderline personality. I was originally upset when i read that the psychiatrist had written that as my diagnosis. Now I know so much about borderline personality disorder, and it could’ve been written just for me with only one symptom of the 9 being different . I don’t take anger out on others. I’m not manipulative. I take it All out on myself . Quiet borderline personality diagnosis was confirmed by my psych who I see for my meds. I knew long ago that I created much of my personality. I used to even tell some people I could do that. I created part of my personality In my late teens. Then i did some touch up work on the rapid mood changes in my mid 20’s. I was stuck w the intensity of the moods :((((.... I I’m an empath which, at a young age, older people would call me a victim soul. So much finally made since. My emotions used to always be so erratic. I 
had an uncle and my brother buying me those stones for anxiety when I was around 5-6 years old. I changed that myself in my mid 20’s. The main difference between bpd and bipolar, which is a mood disorder., is the length of time the person is stuck on an emotion before it changes without any reason. Bpd moods may last for only minutes but never real long. Pw Bipolar can stay in a mood for days or over a week before it abruptly changes very dramatically for no reason. I’m pretty new here and I also forgot I used this app months. By the time I found this site, I had been thru more than I could handle. I was still severely depressed after a breakdown 2 years before. Nobody would ever agree to treat me or ‘weren’t equipped to”. I lost all hope and made back to back serious attempts. Then the behavioral hospital filed to have extra holds put on me. They were upset when, after the 2 serious attempts that put me in there, I hung myself in their room only 2 days after arriving. I had been cleared to leave th
e medical hospital after treatment for the carbon monoxide poisoning. They were even going to get a judicial hold on me but I was able to talk my mom out of helping them do it. Now that was a long post. I shouldn’t have smoked first :// I do want to welcome you here. U are off to a great start. U will obviously be an asset to this site!!!! Nobody here knows me, but for the fact I was out of hope by the time I joined this site . All my posts are more like end of the life posts. Honestly tho, things really are pretty bad.

Professional meditators are able to ignore their thoughts while reading a book and don't get lost in thought (Like when reading a book for example - They don't have to reread a paragraph or a page) and when they do, they're immediately able to focus again. There was a study done where people that never meditated in their life were put under a brain scan and then they did meditation for a certain number of weeks for half an hour every day.. They did the brain scan again and grey matter grew in the areas of self awareness and decreased in the areas of stress."

I think the meds are a very counterintuitive science. It's the ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" science. I clearly don't understand his decision-making process. I also don't think that meds can do everything. Don't get me wrong, meds have helped in the past, but they're not everything I do to keep my mood up. I dislike how everyone around me acts like the meds are the only thing propping me up. Yet they have terrible side effects. I just hate how my pdoc labels everything. It's like everything has to have a cause. Like everything I experience is able to be traced back to a cause. That idea is b.s. in my opinion. I also hate how every therapist I have had just says "

to their religion. they want scheduled conversations so we ""don't lose touch"". they want emotional support! i've had friends turn on me simply because i moved away. i've had friends shoving their tongue down my throat when i'm too drunk to move. like they just can't help themselves. from their eyes though, i'm sure i look twisted. they put faith in me when they shouldn't. they think things mean something when they mean nothing to me. and really, i'm not so good i guess. lies make everything clear. make us both understand we aren't close. anyway, i think you need to get over it. people always lie. expect it from the start. parents, siblings, friends, therapists. it's not particularly a bad thing unless you trust them to do something. like keeping secrets, or just things you don't want others to hear. they will share it. maybe not immediately, but they are just waiting for the opportunity to use it. they will always hoard what you say and barf it back up."

175957487,"_PERSON_, I am so proud of you for posting. It is very difficult for anyone to say out loud some of the most horrific things that have happened to us. First, let me say that I am sorry for what happened and what you had to endure growing up. I am also sorry for the pain that you continue to feel. Please let me tell you that it can get better. I am living proof that it can. However, it does require work. Starting with therapy is a great first step. You need help and you are getting that help. Do not be discouraged if the first person that you see doesn't seem to get results for you. The one thing that I learned after years of therapy is that there is a doctor or therapist available for you, but you might have to try a few before you find him or her. Just be honest with the therapist if you feel like things aren't clicking. If you are dealing with a true professional, he or she will be all too happy to try to find someone that will work with you more effectively. If you are dealing with a not so nice 
one, then you will know you have made the right decision to leave. But, it won't be done in a few sessions. Please don't be discouraged by that either. The work is worth it and it will make you feel so empowered when you come out on the other side. You are strong and you will come out on the other side. You are normal. You are doing the best that you can do right now. You just have to focus on yourself and keep putting one foot in front of the other. Like other things, this too is a marathon. Once you build your toolbox of coping tools, you will start to feel so much better. Medication is certainly an option. I have been on different types of meds for my anxiety and/or depression. You do not have to be over-medicated; however, it does not show weakness to use a little help when you can. Please keep us updated!! We are rooting for you. You can do this!"

It’s hard to get out of bed in the morning or at all, go to sleep before the early hours in the morning, get dressed, go outside, do homework, and just living is agonizing. I’ve become so good at hiding this and it scares me. I make up scenarios in my head that I daydream about for hours on end just to escape this world; it’s just easier than being in the moment. Nothing “traumatic” has ever happened to me and sometimes I feel like it’s ridiculous for me to be this way because of that.

It was nice because they were distinctly and loudly sung in their voices, in my head, and both had a lot of energy behind them.

chool hallway, worked up and thinking about a situation I'd just embarrassed myself in, and as I turned the corner, I almost bumped into a young lady clutching her school binders to her chest. We both startled, but I believe I left her more-so, because upon making eyewidened eye contact, I desperately and pleadingly burst out with, ""Well, I don't know! How was I supposed to know what to do?"" which was supposed to stay as an inner monologue. 'Twas the same day I thought I saw someone I used to be good friends with (who also occassionally was working on campus grounds), so I joyously called out the girl-pop-singer's name that I used to address him as (we used to try to embarrass each other). Confused when he didn't react, I called out more insistently. A young man that was not him turned around, almost as disconcerted as the girl earlier. A few years ago, he posted me on a social media's local buy-and-sell page introducing me and describing me the way the TV hosts did from those old dating talkshows; saying t
hat I was looking for a mate and describing (made up stupid) likes of mine etc"

175957542,"Depression & anxiety are real health issues just like diabetes or cancer. For real. Not character flaws or ""weakness"" any more than cancer is weakness. Can you go to a free clinic and talk to a doctor or nurse practitioner? Or a social worker or therapist? Seriously, it's a real health issue and there are really things that can help. I've had struggles with depression most of my adult life. I've found meds that saved me from spiraling down to dark places. They didn't make me feel high or anything like that, just made me feel more like the real me. Best wishes & positive vibes your way."
175957543,I will tell you something else...being off meds was stressful like every sound I was like real or voice? It was really hard to tell sometimes off meds...my relapse started with knocking sounds which you hear everywhere...I was much more angry too maybe because of bp irritation?
175957544,"I think I'm having cabin fever. I could do multiple things but I can't decide. I feel alone. My mom is working and she comes home stressed. I feel bad for bringing up the past and telling her to stop drinking and being herself. Now it's like she hates me and doesn't want to cook dinner. I told her that I want to learn how so I can move out - But I'm scared to move out. I feel safe here. It's really complicated to me. I want to phone my therapist today but I don't know what to say. I don't know what is wrong with me. I can't just be happy where I am now and do things. I need constant inspiration - And the inspiration I get sometimes scares me. I care too much about what other people think. I'm scared of the economy getting worse and all of the uncertainty. I can't focus. I just want to read or something - But I have so much uncertainty - Like I don't know much about the world and everyone seems like they do. I missed my opportunity to grow mentally as a person when I was isolated, sleeping, helping 
suicidal people online, doing mindless tasks and working as a mechanic and welder. It was all for nothing. It's like I had no mind - I didn't see life like I do now. I wasted time. Every song I listen to is horrible. I just want to go somewhere or distract myself away from my room or this house. I'm scared of being unwell and going insane like I was at the end of the injection. I took an extra vyvanse and more phenibut so if that helps, I'll have to see my psychiatrist so she can prescribe something that can balance my brain chemicals. I don't feel like exercising cuz I feel like I'd be wasting time. I'm too aware of everything like I just came out of a 20 year long fog. I'm not happy or content. I'm miserable. I feel like I'm sane and everyone else is insane.. Like everything is just a bunch of pictures and everything is in my imagination - It's spiralling down a dark hole to hell."

So keep searching. They can help with so much. Giving you strength to deal with all of this. Either way I wish you peace and happiness and good health with the coming of the new year. I guess it is just a number like our age, but 2020 feels rather significant to me, I don't know why. It feels like a year of change for some reason.

175957568,"What never fails to bring me into the ""now"" (and out of spiraling anxiety) is paying attention to what is right in front of me - that is what is real - not what is happening in my head or in my thinking at that moment.

When you catch yourself waiting, even if it's just standing in a line, snap out of it. Find some pleasure in the present moment."

175957579,Hi Park Welcome back to the forum but sorry to hear you are having a tough time at the moment. You have got a lot on your plate at the moment and it sounds like you are taking all the right steps towards helping you deal things which is good to hear. Don’t be to hard on yourself as set backs happen but you know you have the skills to help you so revisit those. Sorry to hear about your sister that must of been a shock for all of your family but keep doing what you are doing by supporting her and being there for her and she will pull through. Keep is posted we are here for you. Sending hugs. _PERSON_
175957580,"HI SACshmo, You are definitely not alone. I understand the hitting. I think a lot of it comes from being hit at one point as a child. Or the violent behavior of the parents. I get angry and don't know how to express it. I usually end up taking it out on myself. I know that isn't right but don't know what else to do. I haven't hit myself in a long time and I am happy about that. I don't know what to do for it. I have never talked to anybody about it much. One therapist years ago said something about shaking myself out of things by doing that. I do pretty much calm down afterwards. But I guess the point is that you don't deserve to be hit or hurt yourself. You are taking it out on yourself and that is the wrong person. I guess the only advice I have is talk to your therapist or psychiatrist about it and try to learn another way to let off steam. I will try to do the same. I know it is hard with lockdown and social distancing. But know we are all going through the same thing. None of us like it. Espec
ially people who like to be social. Which I keep to myself a lot. But that is choice, so the lockdown doesn't bother me too much. I guess I am lucky there. I hope you feel better. Remember to love yourself. Hugs, _NAME_..."

But since adding Thorazine and Depakote, even though I still really can't sleep, it has left me sort of dazed and really fatigued physically. Here's what I am trying to do: Getting my butt up and moving and doing my routine, regardless. Riding my bike almost every day for at least 2 hours. Never want to do it, always feel better once I am out there. Sipping green tea makes me feel better. Finding a show I like makes me feel better. Reading a good book does, as well. Making myself cook or bake something nice. In short, the key for me seems to be action when I don't want to do any action. We'll see if I can keep it up."

175957609,"Minipuff: You said you have an appt. in about a week. Can you ask him about the Melatonin from the health food store for sleep? You said he wanted you to wait until your medicines were settled first. I know how difficult it is to not be able to sleep. I use a sleeping pad sometimes and it seems to help. This is what the net says about Buspar: “This medication is used to treat anxiety. It may help you think more clearly, relax, worry less, and take part in everyday life. It may also help you to feel less jittery and irritable, and may control symptoms such as trouble sleeping…. Buspirone is a medication for anxiety (anxiolytic) that works by affecting certain natural substances in the brain (neurotransmitters)."" This is what the net says about Prozac (webmd.com): ""Fluoxetine is used to treat depression, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder….” ""This medication may improve your mood, sleep, appetite, and energy level and may help restore your interest in daily living. It may decreas
e fear, anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and the number of panic attacks. It may also reduce the urge to perform repeated tasks (compulsions such as hand-washing, counting, and checking) that interfere with daily living."" You first took Buspar on 10-7-2020, 10 mg. and were already on 60 mg. of Prozac. Buspar was increased to 20 mg. on 11-20 and 60 mg to 80 mg. of anti-depressant Prozac on that same day. You were having panic attacks on and before Sept. 10 when you first wrote in. You have not had one since. You increased from 10 mg. to 20 mg. of anti-anxiety Buspar since 11-20, or for 7 days now. In your first post on Sept. 10, now 77 days ago, you wrote: “I'm spiralling out of control with panic attacks. “And those of you with panic attacks know the spiral is always deeper and deeper with more what if what if what if. I'm not handling the change well. I understand this is life, I have no control, I must accept it. I can say those things but I can't stop my brain from making it into a nuclear bomb of terror a
nd chaos. Racing thoughts, hot, cold, sweating, goosebumps, that suddenly burning feeling starting in your stomach and the burn goes out through your body, pounding heart. You know the deal. “I hate changing meds. It's yet another phobia I have. I put it off and put it off. I don't even like taking the klonopin. I hate it so much. Last night was night 4 of no sleep. Bc of my fears, I only took 1/4 of a tablet. Didn't sleep any better. Had anxiety. Got up with panic attack. Crying sobbing couldn't breath. Couldn't even do to work. I can't have this affecting my ability to work. “Here are my qestions, now that I've blurted my week of chaos out to you...” Just yesterday (11-26-2020) you wrote: 1. ""The only change I have noticed is the insomnia returned. I guess it'll take 3 weeks to adjust to the new dose and be able to sleep well. 2. ""I'm trying to stay positive. I'm sort of at the point, right now, eh... What ever... Eventually we'll figure it out. Idk how I'm feeling right now. You don’t mention cry

175957611,I'm excited about starting to walking more! I used to walk around 7-10 miles a day total. Going to be taking the stairs to my 3rd floor apartment instead of using the elevator anymore. Just trying to be more active throughout the day too in general.

175957623,Hi I am currently taking Prozac and your psych is right the symptoms should start to ease after a couple of weeks once your body gets used to the medication so I would say stick with it. I have found it to be an effective medication. _PERSON_
175957624,"It was brave of you to share and braver still how you are trying to love your family despite all that has happened. I second another's opinion that you may have to leave your hometown, or at the very least your childhood home. You've suffered trauma there, compounded by lack of actions from your parents, leading to feelings of unsafety from two different points. That doesn't mean you can't overcome it, but a healthy distance from where it happened might allow you to loosen a little of your anxiety. As others have also suggested, going to therapy might help you deal with your anxiety even more and begin the healing process. Once you take that step, you might even be able to suggest to your step brother that he seek his own therapy. It's obvious that you still care for him and realize that he has a mental issue that also needs help. I think you are right that he developed an unhealthy attitude from incest porn at an impressionable age which was not addressed by his dad or your mom. Obviously they did
n't know and neither did you until recently, but I don't think a right decision should really have been that tough for them after they found out about the voyeurism and innapropriate touching. If they held your interest and his in such concern, they should have suggested therapy from the get go for both of you. From your mention that he has never had a girlfriend or seemed interested in dating even while sexually attracted to you, it seems that he may have traumatized himself in a way that he can't easily address since those around him pretended like it was no big deal. Obviously he is an adult now and has always been responsible for his own choices, but at 14 and as a young teenager, he would likely not have pushed for therapy himself. Those older than him and responsible for his and your care should have sought help and maybe his behavior could have been curbed rather than cemented. In short, I think you have every right to feel lingering anger at their actions, or lack of action because they not only faile
d you, but their son as well. That sounds harsh, but I don't think their failure came from a lack of love. People, including parents, sometimes make grevious errors. People, including parents, often wish for everything to be fine and think they can make things normal by acting normal. But ignoring deep-rooted issues won't allow any of you to truly grow and move on. You don't have to wait for them to act in a certain manner or say something to either you or your step brother. You yourself are an adult now and can take steps toward your own self-care and mental health. You are brave and you are strong."

175957627,Cool! This reminds me of early days on the Internet where the browser literally had a what’s cool column on the homepage. Now we find stuff through others.
175957628,"C., Okay, glad that you were 'heard' at your appointment and that you now have a new plan of action. This will go a long way in giving you some hopeful relief...as well as, fingers crossed, a better long term regimen for management! Keep us updated so we can keep you in support. S.C."
175957629,"Talked to my doctor today. He read out what the psychiatrist said in her letter basically what she said to me basically that she would probably label me as schizoaffective instead of bipolar 1. So that’s interesting. But I asked my doc and he said it would be okay having a couple drinks every now and then, so I bought so bourbon and had an old fashioned tonight. Pace and limit myself though. Otherwise I’m doing good. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

175957632,"If its for psychosis basically all the meds are roughly equivalent except zyprexa and clozapine. The only thing that changes are the side effects and they don’t work at all for 25-35% of the population. It’s not so much the doctors as the inefficient tools they’ve been given. For anxiety SSRIs are the first line but a lot of us can’t take SSRIs without also being on a mood stabilizer, if we’ve got any mood elements other than pure depression. If it’s the ADHD the APs directly counteract th stimulants so getting the right balance is difficult and most people will end up with some psychosis. It’s an impossible situation to solve in many cases. I’m certainly not happy with what my meds have done to me but it’s a lot worse to be psychotic imo."

175957635,"I care about others. It's just I can't be too close to them for various reasons. These reasons could be that they have different World views, are unintelligent, unreliable or just plain out of their minds. I have been disappointed by others so often that I have long ""thrown my hands up"" and just had to observe others from a distance. There's only so much you can do."
175957636,Hi Sorry to hear you have had a return of your anxiety it sounds like you may be having panic attacks during these moments I find that concentrating on my breathing helps we have some good links in our resources section so take a look also look at the Mindfulness links as they should help as well. Keep us posted _PERSON_
175957637,"That would be religion. Although depression can nicely take the edge off worrying about one's health (especially if there are symptoms of something), money problems, and the need one feels to maintain things like a proper diet, social endeavors (if you have them), and personal hygiene. If I walk into my therapist's office with a beard, she knows I've been having a depressive period."
175957638,"Yeah I realize that weed makes me take a hard look at myself and who I am - Which I avoid (Hence the severe experimentation with substances, partially). You might feel this way for a few hours or a day - Or a few days. It subsides though eventually so don't worry."
175957639,Anxiety? I get this for work and even fun stuff sometimes.
175957640,"Thanks for your replies. After weaning off Cipralex in Oct. after 2 1/2 years I had a trigger in November that really did a number on me. So I have gone back on Cipralex 5 mg. I did have a few times when i had to take a lorazapam but I felt the cipralex starting to work again. I am very cautious and vigilant re lorazapam. I took a lorazapam before some dental work on Dec. 9- up till then my anxiety level was rather peaceful and since Dec. 9 I have had no anxiety even tho Christmas is tough since losing my Mom in 2017. Christmas night just about to take my first bite of dinner I got that ""oh-oh"" waft come over me.I paused on the food, did deep breathing and listened to some classical calming music and in about 15 minutes was fine. Dec. 26 I didn't feel great- first thing walking the dog and even tho it was cold was unloosening my collar and taking off my hat - just wanted to be back inside. Rest of the day I kept busy to keep my brain from overthinking but the stomach muscles were tight as steel..
. but I got through it very uncomfortably because i didn't want to take a lorazapam. Dec. 27 - I was awakened by a headache- unusual - and then after 20 minutes the muscles aches started, stomach upset and again the oh-oh's so around noon I took a lorazapam hoping to break the cycle. Wasn't till about 10 pm when i suddenly felt hungry and realized my stomach had relaxed. Now today, Dec. 28 I awake at 6;30am and immediatly start shaking and I gave it 10 mins and said this is going to be big so i took a lorazapam right away and lay in bed for 2 more hours, deep breathing and calming music. This is no way to go on. Should I assume I should go back to the 10 mg I was on for 2 1/2 yrs until this past summer? And more importantly since I have been back on 5 mg. since October will I have additional side effects when I move the dose up. I cant remember from my initial dose up in 2017 if I had any side effects. I am just feeling more intolerant of more of this crap. Very much appreciate any input. Thanks so much."
175957641,"long time celexa user here-yes celexa usually takes a month to work. took 6 weeks for me. its a gentle drug for me -by far the easiest on my system of the ssri,s i have taken.how ever we all react in different ways to these meds. i had a terriable reaction to lexapro -which is a stronger version of celexa. what dose are you taking? i started at 10 mg. also this med is better taken in the morning usually. celexa is by far the best ssri i have taken and feel blessed i tried it. its so gentle you dont even know you are taken a med at all -except anxiety is gone. keep us informed of how things go and hang in there. you WILL get better eventually."
175957642,Sorry you're struggling SK I hope your appointment tonight goes well. Do you still have the stuff from the anchor box? That might be helpful
175957643,Honestly I had to join support groups to talk about it - like with people like me. But since I’m mostly house bound now bc of the virus. I’ve joined these online forums so I don’t feel as alone. Best thing. To talk to people like me or others who understand. But talk About movies or music. Get your mind off of things. Play online games. Do whatever you can to get out of your mind.

I can’t eat certain things either. I had to quit eating ramen. Tons of diff foods. And I’m allergic to certain scents.

And above all there is the rationale of _PERSON_ ""Nothing in biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution"". We as humans are highly social mammals.

Just keep giving her all your unconditional love as I know you are. She will heal in time I have faith because she has people that care about her.

175957678,"So I tested my theory and clicked on a random note in my notes and I read this (I don't even remember writing it).. ""We can all choose any religion we want. It doesn't matter but this message isn't about religion or the rules of society are broken. Rules that are made by the majority which controls the availability of thoughts that we can communicate to each other by pressing buttons. Transforming is all we do constantly and memory is the big part I'm trying to tell you about. When people get old, they start losing their memory. To prepare them for the afterlife of reincarnation, forgetting who they are in the past life because the truth is just too painful to handle. If you want everything to go black, then what's the point of changing your mind? If someone wants to kill me, then let them do it because I'd rather not live in a world where someone doesn't want me in it. I feel vibes from the airways of sound in electricity of thoughts from people in real life. Some try to format certain anxiety wi
th my heart beating sometimes fast out of me because they feel powerful like in my writing, except I don't feel powerful. I just feel energy. The heartbeat in my world I believe goes in a certain order but I can't figure out which order it is in. It beats, contracts but in between is a pause. A pause of the nothingness in reality. Two parts that beat from the nodes of electrical currents at different times. It's not complicated. Just be irrational. The pause is a single fraction of a single unit in time and space. An afterlife means our own. Death is the pause. But no one can comprehend the illusion of static that we all see when we open and close our eyes. It doesn't matter. Flying? Just not in this lifetime. On planes, space - rockets, used with nuclear warheads to kill. Is that how we want the world to end? The planets and stars will align and drag you into _USER_ID_'s gravitational pull and for sure 15 years ago as a child I was baffled by the discovery of new moons orbiting around it. Like a delusion. In 
factor of communication, I would like to say that the belief of anything is an instant suicide that is infinite and something that we can't control. Screaming at nothing can bring a transformed you. Peace will be just an illusion. Like love. Only you can make it real if you choose. Anything is a choice. The past defines that choice. When I was about to sleep last night, I saw visions of things when I closed my eyes. Then the dreams began solid throughout the night. Memory is involved in this process. It's an important key factor to life. But I just went to sleep anyways."" That's really messed up. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm way more mentally ill than I think I am or maybe I'm just overthinking this. I hope I don't panic because of this.."

175957682,"My son is 19. He was diagnosed with OCD/anxiety/depression 6 years ago, and has been hospitalized several times and has been on various meds over the years. He has now been off meds for 6 months and refuses to take them. He has become obsessed with conspiracy theories to the point where he can’t handle his emotions and is completely overwhelmed by the evil in the world. The things he believes are outlandish and very hard to listen to: Jews are taking over the world and are satan worshippers, high level politicians involved in child sex rings, etc. I know he’s getting this from the internet but he truly believes it, to the point of crying in despair. Is this psychosis?"

175957699,Well I’ll be completely honest. I’ve been off meds for 6 months and my feelings still aren’t “normal”. I think they’ve been permanently warped. I’m not at all anti-med. I will be going back on when I finally get in to see my pnp. But at a much lower dosage. I think 5 years of heavy duty APs and 10 years of ADs has just changed me. Sucks.

I feel I have no support!!! How did I marry my mom? Now I’m even more stressed out and just want to yell!!! But he has apologized... he actually listened to me ... but I’m damn nervous about my appointment with the gyn after having a dnc because of bleeding after menopause... the morning of that surgery... started out the same way!!! It’s like he looks for shit to get upset about!! Then I’m made to feel like I’m not supporting him... I hate this!!! I love and hate my husband! And right now I dammed sure don’t want him to go with me to the dr. Even though he has promised he won’t be a dick... but the past is the past!!! I have no one to talk to!!! He gets on t
hese sites and gets to Interact with a support system and I’m writing this!!! It’s not fair!!! We moved to Ok back in January and with covid I don’t know any one!!! Even my sister which I was close to .... it’s like since I moved she doesn’t want to talk with me because she has to deal with my mom because she’s the only one left on the farm!!! I’m just tired constantly and in pain constantly, I take naps constantly and nothing helps! I’m so depressed because of all this, and one a good day... I try to make sure our house is cleaned, dishes are done and laundry is washed, dried and put up. And dogs are taken care of. And then I see that my hubby can’t even turn around and throw trash in the can. Or spills coffee and can’t wipe it off and it stains the wipe cabinets.. damn!!! And he just got a job after 16 years..... more stress and can he handle it? Or is he going to act like he did when he was in the military? Honestly I don’t know if I can handle this."

175957722,"I always have an internal monologue. Constant 24/7 never stops for a second. Some people don't have this. The voices I've heard in psychosis came from sources around the room or in other rooms and I could hear them like there was someone really talking. This comment is worth it's weight in gold, an internal monologue is called subvocalization or self-talk, with which some of us are tormented with as we get sort of groomed into internalizing inner talk more as this 'thing' harass and attempts to blackmail you. Within my personnel experiences of this, I do believe that some of us are indeed TI's though you would never know without the internet."

I know some people say you'll leave your body behind when they go to the afterlife and they'll be an orb of energy and love or some crap but I just ""think"" I'll be in heaven with my friends and family.

But he didn't trip balls like I did. Neith

I think about him a lot and he has a little to do with my psychosis so maybe I'll see him in MY afterlife, where we all have our own 99.9999 etc % of afterlives almost an infinite amount times until the 100th percent of infinity (God himself which becomes infinity, which becomes God, which becomes infinity and it keeps going up and up and up until BOOM - The Big Bang Theory - Which ends up being disproven, even SO, And the egotistical people and narcissists one upping themselves and the good people one upping others, the buddhist monks making a man realize that he's the master until the man realizes he's the fool and then until he realizes that the master is the fool and the man is the master, the shamans using the powers to heal, - all of it..), where we all connect to become each other and become one where my afterlife is the real one, and so is everyone else's. I know this sounds a little psychotic but idk what isn't psychotic in this world. I'm not afraid of losing my IQ from the anti
psychotics. Because it doesn't matter. Sure, I could have become rich (With the IQ I had when I was a kid). I still can do anything and wherever life takes me, I'll accept it."

I won't have so much racing thoughts and I love racing thoughts but after taking 7.5mg of olanzepine (Zyprexa) for the past 3 days (Because it's the end of my injection), I realize that antipsychotics arent so bad. Especially if they improve stable neuroplasticity and help me focus."
175957734,"I woke up at 4am i went to bed reasonably early but now. There is no one awake all the night owls have gone to sleep since its now almost 6am. I have a new pdoc phone call today. I have things i have written down to ask. So i am prepared on that front. I wish the pdoc would do zoom calls. Would make it easier to talk to and get to know. Phone calls are just easy to get away with body language and the personaly connection is lost easy. I talked to a student counselor last night who came in with an agenda to fix my ""anxiety"". I had anxiety because she didnt send out the zoom call invite until 3 mins before our session. And was 5 mins late before she connected. I tried to explain to her that she would have anxiety to and that if a clinician was suppose to give her if she was the client ample time to get ready she would fret to. Then the clinician connected 5 mins late without an apology. How would she feel? She basically tried to divert me from how i was feeling or asking her the question. I became 
seriously angry and frustrated. I told her i dont need to be fixed i am not a science experiment i wanted to use my time to decompress my week not look at charts and diagrams about anxiety. I also said this isnt school this real life i am not a subject in laboratory thats part of an experiment. After my session i emailed her supervisor. I said i look forward all week to talk and then i am being told i have to be ""fixed"". I dont take this lightly but shes going a different direction then me. She might always be a student and may never be a good counselor. I said you pick good students to work with you and your a brilliant Phd. Clininical counselor but she continues to miss the mark."

175957741,"OceanFisher, If I were you I would contact a psychiatrist and see if they have anybody doing telephone therapy. You can use skype, zoom or facetime. Or just the telephone. Have you ever had therapy? Most regular doctors only try certain things because mental health is not actually their specialty. I know you feel bad that you can't get out and help people. And the people you were helping are definitely hurting. There is probably no soup for the people that were coming to get it. No matter how bad it seems, there is usually somebody worse off than ourselves. Try taking things slow, slow your mind down and try to make the best of things. I am sure that there are good things in your life you can reflect on. They may be small but they are very powerful when it comes to the way we are feeling at the moment. Maybe you and your wife can start playing games. Board games or cards. Something to keep your mind busy. Do you belong to aarp? They have online events people can watch. Puzzles to do. You may have t
o look but if you have a phone or computer, there is a lot you can do online. I know it is tough when we feel we are in the bottom of a pit.

Sometimes I get a big pile of stuff to do right at the end of the day but at the moment there's nothing pressing. The owner is coming next week and then the controller is coming the week after that. I'm really glad I cleaned my office. Really sorted through my papers and tossed a bunch of stuff that I don't think I need and if I do, well too late. I have T tonight but I don't feel like I have anything to say. I'm actually not in crisis for once so it's weird. I don't know what I am going to talk about. Maybe just keep it light. I'm really tired though. It took a long time for me to get to sleep last night. At least tomorrow I shouldn't have to come into work early. So maybe I can get a little extra sleep. Wow, I just totally zoned out there for a little bit. I was writing this and then I just like went away for a while. Maybe I'm dissociated. I don't feel quite here. Ei

175957766,"I think people say they fear death, but they don't really fear death, they fear what it means. Realistically, you can't fear death because it's something you'll never experience. We only experience something when we reflect on it and, by its nature, you can't reflect on your own death. So, what is it that people really fear? I think a lot of it is fear of missing out; that the world and the people you know will carry on doing stuff and you'll eventually be relegated to a picture on the wall and eventually that will go into someone's bin. I had this conversation with someone recently, and I asked them whether they'd feel better dying if everyone died at the same time, in some catastrophic event. They thought about it for a few seconds and then said yes. I get the point that people often need something to cling to; something that makes them feel that their suffering has some meaning, but how do you get to that? How can you believe something when you know, inside yourself, that it's just a fairy-tale? 
A comment above said that people can't just see this life as a game, but why not? If they choose to believe in a god, which makes little reasonable sense when you think about it, why not believe it's just a game? How you choose to rationalise existence seems to be a combination of personal choice, upbringing conditioning and social comfort. The most rational explanation I've heard as to our existence is simulation theory. People scoff at this, but it makes more sense than some magic man in the Bible. People scoff at it because it doesn't provide them comfort. People suffer and I guess it sucks to be them; we all suffer from time to time. External suffering can't really be avoided, but this is about internal suffering and that we do have a choice over. -- 06 Dec 2019, 07:26 -- Ha."

Something about negative symptoms makes people call us lazy, undisciplined. Yet we try really really hard. It's like the bar of energy has been lowered. Anhedonia, apathy, numbness, etc.. And for some reason it comes with hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc.. Imagine if it was just negative symptoms. People would think we're just lazy and that's all there is too it.

175957776,"Hello _PERSON_ That is a fantastic attitude you have......an inspiration to us all! I am sorry you have had to give up on your big dreams, but let me point you to the fact that you can NOW RE-DREAM YOUR DREAMS ! There are still dreams to be dreamed and to be fulfilled, once you factor in the ability equation....but even at that, there are helps available for one, even before we look, or know that we need them. You use your phone or computer (re posting) so pray tell me, who could be more successful at encouraging others with depression, than you could? Living one's dream has nothing to do with a salary, or an office door, with the name on it. Living ones dream is governed by the satisfaction one receives for being a blessing to another human being And that you are already doing....so build on it. Yes, I can read between the lines, as I read all over your posts, so I have no doubt you might smile sweetly, as you read my post, and think ""if only she knew"". Well....maybe I do understand a bit. As a 
little girl I always wanted to be a nurse. As I reached mid-teens the desire was very strong, and a program was set up in our school, for girls who wanted to enter nursing to join a group whereby we could volunteer at the local hospital on the weekends. Oh I loved it, and it worked well, but something began to happen to my hands and arms...a nasty burning red rash began to break out, and the doctor thought at first that I was maybe allergic to the disinfectants we used to do certain things, so he suggested that I should not book for the summer, and see if we could get this cleared up. Well, it turned out to be the start of psoriatic arthritis.....so there went the skin and the joints....and there went my dreams!! My life has turned out very differently, but...I hasten to add, at 79 years old, I can tell you that I have had a wonderful life. It is still going, the dreams are still being dreamed, and there is far more for me to do than I would be able to do in another 100 years.......PLEASE LORD.....NO !!!!! WH

After a few months, and after a combination of the EMDR and more medication changes, I finally began to calm down. It felt great, as I was no longer living with excessive anxieties. By early 2009, I was much more calm. I don't know if the calmness I was then feeling was because of the EMDR, the medication changes, or a combination. But either way, I was finally calm."

175957799,"Suffering Husband: I have been following your posts. I think it's being unrealistic to think that staying with your wife, would soothe her nerves and control her temper. Loving someone unconditionally doesn't mean that you are forced to stay in a situation where you are being abused and live in fear. You don't have to love her temper because it's a part of her. I strongly believe that your situation will only get worse as time goes by. At this point there is nothing more that you can do - three husbands before you have tried, and failed. I agree with _NAME_, move out and give yourself time to enjoy a peaceful existence and some aspect of safety. All marriages are not happily ever after. Praying for you, _NAME_"

175957802,Hey! Just hanging around. My son is at his gf’s graduation dinner. My daughter is putting away laundry ?. Hubbys at his dads. Just me and the dogs. Going out with my bestest and her gf Wednesday!!! I’m so excited. I haven’t been out in forever. Ran into my nephew’s aunt from his dad’s side today. I’ve known her 30 freaking years! Was good to see her. She’s a step-mom now ?? Her mother was one CRAZY CRAZY woman. She threatened to beat me up from the first time I met her at 13 until she died. She HATED me ?. She was good to my nephew though. Out of all her kids and grandkids he was her favorite. Was sad to hear that my nephew screws her over (his aunt). Apparently last summer she gave him $$ to go to the store for her and he just never came back ?. Sad. Love that kid like my own but he needs a serious wake up call. He just keeps burning his bridges.

175957807,"Tbh not really as this would become rather lengthy lol. Trying to summarize it we usually have people who are very dependent, sometimes borderlinish, who have a need to evacuate their badness outside somehow, while keeping very strict split-images in their minds of peopel who are all-god / always there for them / have all the answers etc and people who are all-bad / who are never there for them / cant get it up in bed (yea this has been a recurring topic for some reason *shrug*)... often not actually wanting answers but rather toilets as it seems. Then we have people who are often rather anti-dependent, with unclear intersubjective boundaries in the sense of for example [subconsciously] seeing other people as parts of themselves, or extensions, or who might identify with the projections the other person is using. So the dynamic is actually objects projection of badness -> devaluation of object. While this is somehow an emotional reaction, I'd rather think this has a lot to do with faulty cognition.

Yes I was a regular when I started in 2007 for a couple years. Was on depression and anxiety board but mostly on herel Just got super busy with my career and so I kinda disappeared. Thanks for your suggestion about meditation. I tried if for a year with the aid of a very skilled psychotherapist and he decided due to my severe form of BP and racing brain I just was able to get there and it was doing more harm than good. I was in DBT at that time and the golden rule of DBT is ""don't do anything to make it worse"". But it is a good suggestion I just need tangible things to slow my brain down - like colouring or tv. As for the boyfriend it's coming to an end. He got upset with me yesterday so it's a matter of time and you are right. Work will be tough but you are correct in that too. I need to not care what others think. HT - thank you for your heali

How are you feeling today? _NAME_ - I should clarify - it was the lithium that I couldn't stay on due to side effects but I didn't experience them at 600 mg, my psychiatrist just thought that wouldn't be a therapeutic dose - wanted me at 900 or 1200. And yes, I'm ultradian. So my mood changes all the time. Depressive episodes are the only states I can stay in for days at a time otherwise I am all over in a day or less.I am on Seroquel for stabliziation and mainly sleep and I will never go off that. I am not allowed to be on antidepressants as they cause hypomania/mania. I need to get back to exercise but obviously this depressive episode has me stuck. I will try to get to the gym tomorrow.

175957847,Picked up some of my meds at the pharmacy. I seemed to do okay with being outside
175957848,"You wrote on November 11 of 2020 that you had just recently had the surgery, and said, “I have anxiety about when the pain from the surgery will go away ya. I don't really like dealing with the pain though” So on Feb. 12, you write: “I only have some pain from the surgery when I walk around for a little while. I think it is cool that I am almost done with that.” That is very cool. When you first wrote in, again, you said, ““I have anxiety about when the pain from the surgery will go away ya. I don't really like dealing with the pain though” So, that’s good you’ve dealt with that. So it took about 3 months which is about what my neighbor said was going to take for her shoulder surgery. So now we have the Lexapro anti-depressant and anti-anxiety which net says takes about 5-6 weeks to work although it can be helpful before that. You said you’ve been taking for a little over a month. about the anti-depressant, you said, “I am just sad that it seems like the lexapro is making me w
ant to eat more things. It is hard to lose a little weight ya. Do you think most anxiety medication make people want to eat more though.” Yes, I’ve found that out about my anti-depressant, also, Mirtazapine. It is very frustrating. I think most anti-depressants could be like that, although I don’t know. Psyc.com.net) says there are some anti-depressants which supposedly don’t cause weight gain, like fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) and bupropion (Wellbutrin, Aplenzin, Forfivo, Zyban). If the Lexapro doesn't work, you might ask your doctor about fluoxetine or bupropion. It is a very difficult situation, and it affects my diabetes diets, also, in that I want to eat the house down which, again, is not good for my diabetes. It might be called the price of getting older and being sick. Again, you mentioned how to reduce chances of getting diabetes. _NAME_ on the Diabetes forum on this web site said on 8-20-2019, which I printed out: ""We need to have a food plan and also do some sort of exercise on a regular b
asis. Food with carbohydrates will raise our blood sugar. The more bread, potatoes, rice, food made with flour and sugar that we eat, the higher our blood sugar will go. You will know this because if you test your blood sugar right before you eat and then about two hours after you finish, you will see how your blood sugar rises when you eat any of that food. ""What can you eat? Meat, chicken, fish, vegetables (but not potatoes or corn), lettuce and other leafy greens, peanut butter, eggs, milk products with no sugar added, cheese, nuts. Corn is a grain and has a lot of carbs. ""A good meal could be a piece of chicken, some sauteed bell peppers with some slices of onions, a small salad. Other dinners could be a different piece of protein (meat) and different vegetables like mushrooms, eggplant, zucchini squash, small portion of green beans. Instead of a salad, have a little plate of salad type food you can pick from like pieces of: celery, radishes, a slice of tomato, a small cucumber, a piece of cheddar. ""Ch
icken salad or tuna salad wrapped in a couple of lettuce leaves can be lunch.” (I, _NAME_, have read limit eggs to three a week because of the high cholesterol, 60-70% of what you'll need all day for one egg.) (“Good” Wraps have only 5 mg of carbs, lower than bread (25 mg), look like small pizza’s, found in bread dept. I think.) I can’t eat wraps for too many meals in a row. So, I’m thinking, low carb bread. I went to the net, and they do make that (from zero to a few carbs). You can also type into the search engine, “Where do they sell low carb bread” or add “in my hometown”."

175957850,"Yes, you said one of your medicines (Depakote) would be the mood stabilizer for bipolar, and one (Trazodone) is for the depression. I've read on this website where 5 or 10 people were treated for bipolar, and the psychiatrist gave them only an anti-depressant, because they came in as depressed. Well, they're supposed to ask about any manic episodes they may have had, in case they are bipolar, not just depressed. Because, if they're bipolar and they gave them only an anti-depressant, it can send them into mania, and panic attacks. I've had that kind of treatment, misdiagnosed and miss-medicated, myself. So you are fortunate that you got diagnosed and medicated right, as far as both a stabilizer and and anti-depressant. What are you in now, before you took the medicine, a depressed state? Did you have any mania? Are you noticing any improvement?"

175957872,"Chanell93 said... Hi all I'm new to this site... wondering if anyone is still on this thread? I also have to deal with these eye prombles I first started to notice an afterimage of certain objects on the wall it would be like a clear image of it on the wall.. then I noticed if I look at the tv at night and look away I can still see the image on the wall that also happens with my phone .. and i also see trails in my vision and now they started where I can see a clear trail around a lot of things including my own arm or hand and it's really bothering me! I've had two regular eye exams one just two weeks ago and saw an ophthalmologist about a year ago and all said my eyes were fine just a little astigmatism.. also if I move my fingers I can see a clear air or soemthing a clear glow around my hands sometimes ..I get very anxious and read about my symptoms all of the time so I do believe I make it worse on myself.. just wondering others experience Sounds the same as what a few of us here have described. 
My afterimages aren't as intense as yours, I can see them but they dissipate quickly. When you look away and see the image, does it stay for long periods of time, even if you blink numerous times? Or is it 3-10 seconds. The visual trails you are describing seem pretty accurate to what we see. Same as the moving of your fingers, which is just the trailing occurring with brief motion. I assume you don't see the trailing if you are actually watching the moving object, only the peripheral. Have you taken drugs before, legal or otherwise? Any natural supplements? How old are you, and when did you first notice it. Was there any trigger? Are you stressed/depressed at all, and/or suffering other medical issues? If you go to this link: https://www.testufo.com/framerates#count=3&background=none&pps=480 Stick your mouse cursor somewhere in the middle, and stare at it (you can blink if you need). Do you see a translucent, milky white extension of the moving ufo's behind it? Some people believe this part of Visual Snow. A 
sub symptom of a general issue of the visual cortex of the brain. Seeing a static type flickering of some sorts when there's dim lighting, or even during the day. Visual trails like we mentioned, afterimages that are positive or negative, and many other symptoms that are sort of lumped together with this supposed brain issue. I'm skeptical that it's the cause. As that would mean everyone here that hasn't taken drugs or anything, just has some idiopathic version. Seem's rare and unlikely to be the case. I've read other people say they've had their significant other or family members see this ""trail"" we see. But it's just harder for them to see it, or to get the conditions right for them to notice it. And that we just happen to REALLY see it because we're overly aware of it due to anxiety and that we're in this feedback loop of always thinking of it, because we see it, creating a vicious cycle. If ""normal"" people can see it at times too, then it's something that it's inherently not normal, and perhaps we tr
uly are just more in-tuned to it, or have it possibly to a greater degree. I've also noticed that if I close my eyes but still barely open, like when you squint, the trailer seems to be way less intensive. Which I wonder if it has something as well to do with how the amount of light entering my eye is being processed. I don't really see it in pure daylight, or when it's dark. I see it with like low to medium lighting in my house. Or if I'm in the car in garage, and turn on the car light I see it a lot. It seems to be very noticeable with contrast differences, so something bright or light colored against a dark color, ect.."

And, just so you know, you can remove all of that history of depression and just be yourself. You do not have to own that. My family has generations of depression, schizophrenia, addiction, everything, and I am totally fine. It has taken a lot of work on my part but you can totally do it. I'm happy to help if you want to just be you. no labels. Just human. Stay safe and be well."

175957898,"It sounds like you have so much on your plate. As cliche as it sounds, it truly does help to do one thing at a time. So even in a new state, maybe see if you can do a televisit/telehealth visit with an online therapist so that you have the support you need wherever you are. That can get you grounded. Then the next steps of getting your meds. And when you feel you are taking care of you, then you will be in a position to help your daughter without being overwhelmed. Even the Bible says this at Ecclesiastes 3:1 ""There is an appointed time for everything, A time for every activity under the heavens"" I'll summarize an article I read since we can't post links here. But it said what can you do when facing overwhelming demands? Maybe these suggestions can help. See if you can enlist the aid of others. Made your needs known. See where you can be accommodated or adjust schedules/tasks as needed. Keep track of the number of demands on you. Can anything be delegated to others or postponed if there is no one 
else available? Be selective about what you take on/accept. If you lack the energy, it's okay to say no. Bottom line. If you try to do everything, you may put yourself in a position where you can't do anything. I hope any part of this has been a help to you and that you find your ground, your strength, and some peace in the days to come. Best wishes."

I am an INTJ, which usually makes a few people do an obligatory, ""oh **** please do not eat me"" due to rampant stereotyping, heh. The Machiavellian mastermind thing is overdone by now. Though, that said I do have ridiculously excellent foresight, and I use my powers for good ... most of the time ... I have never done psychedelics, though the purely scientific part of my mind is curious about what that kind of thing would do to a brain like mine that is continuously psychotic as it is. For me, it seems that my schizophrenia is maintained by and has a foundation built upon fear at an extremely basic level. Not anxiety or panic. Not some nons
ensical emotional overly personalized subjective abstraction of the word ""fear"" either. I am talking about fear in a more cerebral sense of the word and also the very primal/instinctive sense of the word simultaneously.

I have a bad back and have been taking OPIOD's for years to help with the chronic pain i'm currently thinking about starting to discontinue them or at least lower the dosage. I have heard that it is very hard to discontinue them and it must be done under supervision of a doctor and a very slow weaning schedule is required. I also recently (5 weeks ago) stopped taking Valium which is a benzodiazepine after taking it daily for a few years and I won't lie it was tough and i'm still suffering with withdrawal now which i'm told by my pdoc may take a while to settle back down.

175957935,"Hey guys, Wonder if anyone can shed abit of light for me. Been struggling with arm pain which includes a dull ache, weakness/numbness in my arm from elbow to fingers. Had it for few weeks now but since ive been on holiday which is now 10days I have experienced it more and its got stronger and longer. Think this may be down to the heat? Taken ibuprofen which doesnt seem to get rid of the pain. Not sure whether its due to anxiety, or a side effect of esomeprazole which I have taken for a few months. I also have a pain just past the elbow which is tender and when massaged or pressed it is painful. This occured just in the left arm but I now seem to get it a little bit in right arm. I have applied ice and it seems to help it calm down and not be as strong or severe. When this arm pain happens it has often started a panic attacksad in which my brain thinks the worst when i get this and sends my whole body into a bubble of fear which makes me over think that im about to die:/ Would like to see if anyone 
maybe knows what its related too. Thanks."

I've had a lot of trouble finding an online therapist, so I cancelled my account and asked for a refund. I used to check in with several friends each day. But only a few remain. Some have just vanished. Some don't feel well. I hope wherever they are they are doing Okay. I grow more and more lonely every day. I have no support from my family and the one good therapist I had, moved away. I think today I will try to read some inspirational material. I wish I could connect with my spirit guide.

Case in point: my favorite TV show ever would probably be ""Breaking Bad"", although I think this has more to do with the awesomeness of the show than my own willingness to accept lowbrow entertainment. But then there's ""The Walking Dead"". I like zombie stuff, but there's too much of it, so I have to be selective. I never got past the teaser of the very first episode of TWD because it ripped off the (awful) remake of ""Dawn of the Dead""; if you're going to rip-off a rip-off, chances are it's going to be all downhill from there."

175957966,I have a question about bipolar and the use of meds to treat it Someone I greatly care about is diagnosed as bipolar 1.. from the time I've known them they have been on a combination of drugs that included abilafy Klonopin and Lamotrigine.. these have all been being prescribed by a nurse practitioner and hasn't seen a psychiatrist or therapist in some time. Over the past year I have noticed many of changes finding out through that time that they discontinued taking their Klonopin out of the blue and to my knowledge no longer is taking the abilafy as well just leaving them the Lamotrigine. Over this time I have witnessed self destructive behaviors.. a lot of lying.. saying things deep and meaningful only to turn around a few days later to discredit it all. I'm not completely naive about bipolar and the episodes it can bring.. I've noticed few where they deny it and a day or two later tell me their manic. But my question is how much does playing Dr with one's own meds effect someone with bipolar or no
t keeping up with actual Drs and therapy play in the mood changes and behaviors cause I'm loosing a good friend over the stress of it all. Any input I would deeply appreciate
175957967,"I'm expecting a roll of yarn in the mail tomorrow. Then I could work more on my blanket. I'm excited. I just want to get it done. Maybe these 10 rolls I have will do the trick.

174345373,"I need to lower my injection. My negative symptoms aren't as bad as the negative symptoms that are caused by the antipsychotic by decreasing positive symptoms. I know this because psychedelics increase positive symptoms and can decrease negative symptoms. If antipsychotics are the opposite, they decrease positive symptoms and can increase negative symptoms. ""The traditional antipsychotics are generally poorly effective or ineffective against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and are also associated with extensive side effects which can themselves cause or exacerbate secondary negative symptomatology."""

174345402,"I would say for me... about 40% of the time is nearly (positive) symptom free(hallucinating once a week or less), 40% percent of the time is spent in periods of mild/moderate symptoms (hallucinating around half the days on and off) and 20% of the time is just BAD. I think the 20% is so high because I keep going off my meds (not planning on doing that again any time soon- really, its a goal of mine). Those are the periods mostly when things are REALLY BAD. Though the 40% of the time with mild/moderate symptoms is bad and its frustrating because it happens even when I am on my meds and doing everything to make it stop. Right now Im in a period of being nearly positive symptom free. Its great. But my moods been slightly unstable. My moods are harder to just... my moods I would say I spend about 50% of the time depressed, 10% ish of the time manic/hypomanic... and the rest normal or trying to be normal. I hallucinate and have delusions even when Im in a normal state emotiobally but my hallucinations an
d delusions generally coincide with my mood (if Im depressed the hallucinations and things are darker- if Im manic then they tend to be happier/sillier(more bizarre)/more encouraging. If in in a normal state they can be either of thise thinfs but tend to be more neutral. Anyways. I was wondering what patterns all you guys have with your illnesses. I heard schizoaffective is more episodic in general than schizophrenia- and Im wondering if that is true or not"
175957977,"I can't keep up with the posts! I saw my doctor and talked to him ADHDishly.. I told him that I was doing good, about my mom, investing/crypto, reading, being too depressed at night to watch movies, taking extra vyvanse (For focus) with phenibut (For mood), going to Mexico to visit my dad, maybe moving to BC, how I haven't had a dissociative panic attack in 2-3 months, etc.. I asked my mom for some of my money that she kept for me back 2 weeks ago and she said no cuz my uncle (He owns an internet service provider company) said that the market is too ""Bullish"". I said ""Isn't that the point?"" so I put some extra money in and made ~700 dollars in a few days.. To the moon Bitcoin.. To the moon.. _PERSON_ too.. But I got the 60 vyvanses and will only take 2 a day.. I'll talk to my psychiatrist about IR boosters instead. My doctor said that he likes to take a go at me sometimes cuz I often go down into research rabbit holes but I said ""I enjoy them"" so idk.."
175957978,"It's very difficult at times but you have to reach out and keep trying. It's like being in a relay race, keep jumping over the hurdles and if you feel you just cant do that or you run out of steam, stop and be kind to yourself... You can do this, have faith and keep pushing on, no matter how hard it gets. Remember life is not easy and things may appear to be great for others in your point of view, but everyone has issues and struggles what ever it might be. Be GOOD TO YOURSELF! Don't give up, don't give in and don't be afraid to ask for help! Seek support groups that deal with anger, depression whatever it may be you are NOT alone. So many of us struggle with those types of issues. Block out politics, news and everything negative. When you feel better about yourself doors will open and the ""insignificant things"" in life are easier to deal with.

Yes, it is frustrating and confusing, because of not knowing...fear of the unknown."" Faith Over Fear...Wisdom Over Words....Patient Over Panic "" This has been a big help to me, and I have learned to take slow deep breaths to calm those feelings or sensations you are experiencing. Use art therapy, meditation...tell your mind that it is okay to feel those physical feelings, write in a journal even if you get nothing...place an emoji for that day. To assure you, you are not alone and it takes alot patience, love and time during these episodes, plus if I may, trust God and have faith Him. He will guide you, if you let Him."

Luckily I mainly notice that stuff only in government clinics like where I used to go and where I used to work. That’s another reason why I won’t work with or goto agencies anymore and why I want better insurance for myself.

175958015,"My story is similar to yours in many ways. At the beginning of last year, my anxiety was so bad, I barely left the house. It was unbelievable to me that my husband did not really notice my pain. When I finally confronted him, he helped me find a therapist and was very supportive. With that being said, I think it was my writing that helped the most. I started writing poetry about my anxiety and it helped me understand and work through many of my problems. I then joined a writing group and shared my poetry with others. Like you, I am an introvert, so reading my poetry aloud was terrifying at first. But, very useful. I also keep a gratitude journal, and write down at least 5 things a day that I am grateful for."

175958024,I'm taking the tolerant dose so I suppose I'm not on an effective dose but I'm not withdrawing either. This is just how I am normally - With these circumstances in my environment - Which is why I started taking phenibut. But I'll be lowering the dose even further. I kept having dreams about the past and being abused. I don't remember much. My last dream was about nurses giving me 0.5mg of Cogentin because I was getting tardive dyskinesia in my legs - Then my gums started fading away and my teeth were falling out and I woke up. My dreams were pretty messed up and my dreams usually dictate how good I feel in the day. I need to plan more about things. I just set myself up for failure by not doing anything about ADHD - But I'll look up the r/ADHD subreddit and ask for help there. I have too many interests and can't decide on what to do because I get FOMO in a way for all of the other things? I'm gonna get ready for the day and then I'll talk more about it.

I typed ""Zoloft Reviews"" into the search engine and the first one said: “This is the best medication I have ever taken in my life. I went through my whole life thinking there was something wrong with me because of hiw I felt…. My crying spells reduced and eventually stopped and the same with my panic attacks too. I nkw see the positives instead of the negatives….” A bad review said, “I took Zoloft for anxiety and depression, while on it I couldn't show any emotion and many people around me could tell I was taking this drug because I couldn't show emotion.

He was hospitalized on suicide watch last year and it's so hard for me not to get angry at him when he has bad days. When he has bad days he misses work and it affects us financially. I don't know if I have any good advice, but I can tell you I understand the apathy and the frustration. It can be a lot to handle, especially if you have an off day but you feel like you can't afford to be upset because it could trigger your wife. Don't let her guilt you. That sounds terrible, but when she says things like ""I finally had a good day,"" or ""you should divorce me,"" be blunt. Tell her you love her and you're sorry that she's struggling but that it's important for her to understand how you feel too. Reiterate that you're not saying you'd be better off without her, that you just want to have open communication."

174345487,"Yeah. The ""standard of care in the community"" in any major US metro area for anyone prescribing serious meds is that, once you send the patient off with the script, you are the captain of the ship. You own it and everything that subsequently occurs--whether you personally wish to acknowledge this fact or not. So, yeah, you can suck at your job and push people off to the _NAME_ because you are too lame and pathetic to take responsibility for your patients, BUT, if something untoward or bad ever were to happen and you were not available and you had not empaneled someone to cover for you in your absence, there will be an armada of clincians who will be delighted to step forward in court and say that what you did does not meet the minimum stnadard of care in that town. Someone has to take the calls. Doesn't have to be you, but it has to be someone. You can't toss people out the door on Clozaril and not be responsible and available. If a neutropenic patient called you and you did not answer and they d
ied or got super sick, you are toast. Even dermatologists, which I was the surgical version of for many moons, prescribe extremely dangerous medications and must be available when the rare emergency does occur. And they do. So, most reasonable clinicians take their own calls or, if they are truly ""off,"" someone responsible is assigned those calls while they are absent. Just my personal take and experince, of course. I freely admit to being very old school on such matters."
175958045,"Ever play Terraria or Starbound? They're similar in concept to Stardew Valley, and they're pretty much endless. Admittedly, I haven't played Starbound in a while. I bought it in 2014 on my Mac because my friends at school were playing it, and the devs have made a number of changes to it since then. It used to have no storyline, but now it does have a full story with lots of missions. You get a spaceship and you get to upgrade it so that you can fly to different planets/worlds that have different enemies and resources. You craft all sorts of things. You can also build houses, buildings, etc and move people in. It's pretty similar to Dragon Quest Builders, except in 2D pixel art rather than 3D."

175958064,"Good morning klo1104, thank you for your reply. Trying to find a job at this time is difficult, but not impossible. The trick is to think outside the box. Perhaps jobs in the area you want to work are difficult to find, but do consider something in a totally different field....just to get you back into the work force, and feeling occupied. Even something below your pay scale will have an advantage, and get you past this rough spot. The most difficult thing at this point, is staying convinced that there is a better day coming, with a happier you being able to enjoy it, but please believe me when I say it....IT IS SO! When one gets very depressed, then we tell self lies....things like ""you will never find a job or find a love, or be happy"". Recognize those things as lies, for that is what they are. Would you like to tell me what one thing in particular that has you feeling so badly?"

Been hearing voices everyday ands sounds. A man and a woman talking. Also hear like police sirens and emergency sirens. Also been been hearing whistling and like what sounds like there’s constant music on and maybe a old fashioned radio on (like a AM radio). When I lost my job last March things haven’t been the same with my mental health at all. And then finding out that I wasn’t pregnant anymore in January really put me down a rabbit hole."

175958090,I dont think my mom and sister care about what I'm doing with my life. I cant help but still feel like I cant get them to like me. Of course they love me but my mom has told me a couple if times she doesnt like me. My sister seems apathetic towards me. Idk why I keep chasing their love. It's useless at this point and getting old. I feel nervous.

175958093,My T forgot about me on Saturday. I texted her. Waited. Texted her. Waited. Texted her. Left. She texted me back a little while later and said she had her dates mixed up. And that she would call me later. She ended up calling me at 4 PM. My appointment was at 11 AM but probably she had appointments all in between those times. So we talked. It was okay. She is a little loopy sometimes. She says she thinks my hallucinations are ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts. I'm pretty sure my pdoc is going to have a fit when he hears this. Sometimes I don't know whether to take her seriously or not.

I heard there were a lot of cases due to a party of 45 people. What is wrong with people? It is like they don't even care. But maybe they have to get it in order to believe. Sad thing is that they pass it on to others. I guess that the mask is the new normal. I would rather wear one than catch the virus. I think if we just try to go with the flow and realize that it is what it is it would be much easier to accept. It isn't a good thing. But we can't change it at this time. I think in time with the people that wear the masks and practice social distancing there will be a better scenario. It is too bad, and it is sad. It is also scary. But we are all in this together.

175958140,"astroman said... That last 15% is hard for get rid of. I want to know what normal feels like. For me its also seasonal. I dont get bad winter depression like I did years ago, I get some just because I dont like the 6 months of life/living everyday changes winter brings. Winter is a big hassle, but better than hurricanes and widespread fire- thus, Im not moving. My anxiety will certainly increase from lack of daylight, and like clockwork, its slowly knocking at my door this last few weeks losing 2-3 min of daylight each day. This used to be really bad for the decades I had lyme (from that forum), and I learned many ways to help with the nastyness of anxiety thru natural health and supplements. Lyme magnifies whats already wrong with your body , in addition to its own symptoms, becoming a complete body illness. What is does to the nervous system and possibly of developing autoimmune issues is what the lasting affect is all about in ""chronic lyme"". _PERSON_ helped many people on that forum deal with 
this, but dealing with it and eliminating it are different. Ive come so close but the last remainder may (will) require a different approach than suppliments that only go so far and might create their own issues. There are many ""Anxiety programs"" online, and most seem like scams. They ask for your e-mail and your bombarded. Anyone know of anything good in that department? I'm the type of introvert who can only handle so much on my plate. I need physical and mental space. Yes, I joke that I'm a space Cadette lol! Ive dumbed down my job choices to simplify my life, job boredom is not good, but is better than stress and unachievable modern deadlines. I have many hands on hobbies/interests which is both good and bad. With moderation it keeps my mind happy doing things I love, but I get get so much going on sometimes that I'll make my own anziety. As far as relationships, anxiety and my space requirements kills it. I find the constant effort, maintenance, and extra cost required equals more daily anxiety, so its 
just not worth the effort for me. Its easier for me to just be alone which kind of sucks but thats the honest truth (wish it wasn't). I can easily entertain myself easily for free, just go outside or get lost in my shop projects (simple, logical, down to earth, ""crazy skills/ engineer"", introvert here).... with anxiety. Its funny how the better you get from a chronic condition (lyme), the more 100% normal you still crave. Its like 80-90% well is not good enough anymore. thanks for any thoughts/ideas. Ive only been on this side on the forum a few times. I hope you find positive results as Anxiety is no fun - My anxiety was so bad I couldn't leave the home to check my mailbox or even do groceries or and would starve - I like in CA and found out about a 2 year social anxiety experimental program at Stanford University where they used CBT to reprogram your thinking and track your progress. They had me do things like go to starbucks and start conversation with one stranger a week , or when crossing a sidewalk pa
use and wave to a driver facing you (its weird but they wave back) The CBT helped me a lot . Another thing which helped was learning NLP. The NLP was good because i can pull up some tools and use them in a highly stress situation . Joining Toastmasters was one the best things I think toastmasters (it took me many months of driving round the building to build courage enter for my first meeting) - This really really helped me build up a lot of courage to put myself out there - Toastmasters is also free - look for one in your area they are all over the world ). I also joined a small improv group which really helped also and an acting group. I still have anxiety but its been reduced by about 70% . if I was to pick one thing that really helped me the most i'd have to say ""toastmasters"". After a toastmasters meeting i felt a buzz throughout like i could face the world head-on for the next few hours of the day . good luck ,"

175958154,"I've been in your situation before, in more ways than one. The first situation was, I was living by myself at about age 27 and lost my job, which had a lot of secondary results. Loss of money, loss of socialization, a rise of my emotional problems, which at about 27 was the appearance of my bi-polar ailment which I had not seen full-blown before. I was also not use to making my own decisions. I was also negative unconscious when it came to solving problems. So everything is stacked against me, including myself (my negative unconscious, which really didn't want to solve problems, I wanted to be me (incompetent) like I was raised by my negative parents, with my bi-polar also fowling up my thinking.) So I know I need to see a psychiatrist, but which psychiatrist? So, I can't decide on that, which gives me an excuse to not do anything, but when probably the real reason I'm not doing anything is my negative unconscious which doesn't want me to solve the problem (which my conscious thinking wants to solv
e the problem.) because that's the way I've been raised: worthless, incompetent, can't make a decision. I'm comfortable with that. That's who I am. So I had a nervous breakdown. What I could have done, from what I've read is, believe I can solve the problem before I go into it. To damp out my negative unconscious, which I can't see, I say three times, ""Think positive."" Only then do I start to think of the problem. (See a psychiatrist, pick one on the list, if you don't like that one, go to another one, with my unconscious negative not nullifying my conscious positive decision because I've already damped it out: ""Think positive."" As for the medicine, I was once in such a dilemma, but read in a book, if you;re concerned about a medicine, take only a portion of the pill, that way, if it has bad side effects, you'll only feel a half or a fourth of them. So you can try taking only a small portion of the pill, and if it has side effects you don't want to deal with, don't take any more. You're pretty smart to be 
reaching out for help."

175958158,"_PERSON_, when a patient is at a teaching hospital it can be overwhelming with all of the various students being involved with medical care. I know they need experience, but when it causes anxiety to ramp up, it is bothersome. Listen to your actual dr that is in charge of your care & this is who to ask questions to. When you see the dr make a list of questions to ask the dr too. Years ago my brother was in a car accident & was careflighted to a teaching hospital. He had a brain injury that required a level 3 trauma unit. The closest one was a teaching hospital. His wife had the option of allowing students to be a part of his care & she agreed to it. So many people in/out of his room. However, we identified who his drs were & this is who we dealt with directly. I had a heart attack & had a blood clot hit my left lung. I was on blood thinners while in the hospital to dissolve the clot. Before being released they implanted a filter so that if I got anymore, hopefully the filter will catch it. I was sc
ared at first, but decided I had to let the fear go. Please listen to your dr about the stroke & what he said about the blood clots. If you were in danger your drs would tell you. It is very good news that the stroke was not a bad one. It's going to take some time & patience to get back to normal. Hang in there. As the other member mentioned, check on getting a social worker involved. I would call the hospital & inquire about this. There may be a very good chance something like this is available for you. Yes, you do need to get out of bed & get some activity going every day. Even if it's walking around in your house. I don't know what the weather is like where you live, but just going outside & getting some fresh air is helpful in more ways than one. Take care."

175958181,"Following on from the previous post making a study of how the 'voices' attack or torment their chosen victim, target. I thought I could elaborate even further with a post about the observed methodology. So here it goes. 1) They come in the form of a type of harassment displaying Phishing tactics in order to gain information or they might prefer to mock you instead. Attempts to make you their plaything. 2) What's key to them is the formation of a trigger by the use of Trauma Bonding, this could be achieved through Phish for something from your past, or forming a new sensitization stimulus by word or association. This will then act as a key, or switch in order to play psychological 'games with you through the use of voices that seem to have no point of origin. 3) Anchoring also works via a similar method, this trick is to induce a bad reaction through an everyday stimulus or association to the voices conversation. ( the general direction they are alluring too) 4) Some times or most of the time mine t
end to mimic what you expect top find upon Twitter ( like a Death _USER_ID_ Twitter Storm, or their Facebook witch hunts) 5) The interplay is like Cat & Mouse game or a game of charades like what I have pointed out before in the previous post. The additional fun and games like group gaslighting, Ghosting with personnel items, shining bright lights at night, Floating Box surveillance scare, intimidation tactics are more covert and cloak and daggers, their designed to let you know that you're under watch or being tagged, monitored and openly persecuted clandestinely, or to get you to act out in a derogatory way in order for your to be recorded via iPhone apps. This is also called being Baker Acted. 6) The Power and Control dynamic runs straight through the whole experience, i have never known a more obvious way to put it, no other pathological diseases consist's of psychological power and control attributes other than voice-hearing, Cancer or HIV don't have this construct within them. 7) Another common thread w
ould be the Voyeuristic torture aspect to hearing voices, as they can comment or troll you with venomous impunity 24/7 while you go about your daily business around the house. These are just a few of the things I have noticed over a period of 15 years."

I know how it is to walk on egg shells and make sure that you don’t say anything wrong to upset or further increase their anxiety and negative mood. My only advice to you is to not let your own feelings get buried. I’m going through a rough time right now and throughout the years I’ve suppressed my feelings and closed those communication lines with my wife by hiding behind other activities and things to do instead of pay attention to her needs. You can be there for them, be strong, but don’t let yourself go. They will see this and although they may feel loved and taken care of by you, your unhappiness will come through in other subconscious ways that you may not see. I hope this helps even a little."

174345709,"Antipsychotics for schizophrenia take a while to work, around 6 weeks, but are completely reliant upon your psychiatrist having correctly diagnosed both the cause of your condition as well as how best to treat it. I don't suffer from schizophrenia myself, but have researched it for someone else due to my own misdiagnosis where the psychiatrists, admittedly unsure of their own opinions in my medical records, took a chance and completely committed themselves to an incorrect diagnosis which had devastating consequences for me. Hopefully this page will help you to choose another path; https://mthfrgenehealth.com/mthfr-gene-schizophrenia/ I have a ton of criticisms against psychiatrists which I could detail but I will leave off with just that suggestion for the moment. If you follow up on that and it helps let me know as I am aware of other options."

174345716,"Hi Everybody. I'm tired today. Though I seem to be tired everyday...I think it is the depression part of the Schizoaffective. Either that or the increase in the AP. Shrug. IDK. Not as busy at work today. I apologized to my boss because I kind of ""corrected"" his numbers in a meeting yesterday. I should have waited and talked to him afterward. But he said we are cool, and we fist bumped. So that's good. Not so stressed about that now. I cried last night in my session with Pastor _PERSON_. Not bawling, but enough where I had to wipe away tears. We weren't even talking about anything sad or triggering. I felt embarrassed and stupid, but I don't think he thinks I'm stupid. I think that is my own head telling me that. I think he was confused though as to why I was crying. He thinks maybe because I hold my emotions in all day. And I was really stressed about correcting my boss. No hallucinations so far today. So yeah, that's good. Mostly just trying to figure out how to get through 7 hours more of work.

175958223,"Hi All! It’s been awhile. I’ll dive right in - over the last few weeks I’ve begun waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. This has never happened to me before so of course it has stirred up my anxiety. I consulted Dr. _PERSON_ (which is never a good thing) so now I’m even more worried. I’m 61 - about 6 years post menopause and never had any hot flash issues. I went to see my Doctor and he’s ordered a blood panel which I’m going for on Saturday. In the interim, I just needed to talk it out. Thank you for being there ??"

You have to ride it out and go with the flow, try the best you can to change the thought loops and the rule is, if you're going to kill someone or yourself, you seek help. Everyone is stuck in the universes thought loop and whether or not free will exists, it does if you have the right support and resources. I remember my dads friend with psychosis that smoked weed for 40 years said, free will exists. He was a very happy guy. His own thoughts drives him crazy and he admitted that in his ""Man cave"" where what is said in there, stays in there (So I really shouldn't be saying his secrets) but he was fascinated that I struggled with what he has and takes antipsychotics for it. My dad said, he doesn't have to take meds for himself, but for everyone else!"

It's hard to get in to see a therapist these days because so many are seeking help. I had to shut down watching the news and my only goal now is to stay mildly aware. I had a therapist tell me a story of her client, --he was having so many nightmares he had to seek help with that. Turns out she learned he was watching horror movies (his favorite) over and over and that was what was giving him nightmares."

joke. I barely could get it out i was cackling so loud. I was so high that I thought making a new twitter account ""The High Philosopher"" and I'd just tweet high jokes all day"" What a bad idea! lol I mean, there are already those accounts, and they do quite well actually. But honestly, getting high takes up the entire day for me, and that sucks. Honestly, something that surprises me, is that I never see any of the people I follow tweet while intoxicated. Baffles my mind! They have so much stoic control, I think maybe one does tweet high, he's pretty cool."

174345841,"Lately, I feel as though my ex-girlfriend, from over a decade ago, which I dated for 9 years, that her self-confessed ""people"" that were keeping tabs on me, that they still might be. I've said some things on here that I deeply regret. But as I contemplate on it, what I said about her, it was like a Hamletian ""wild justice"" that happened out a ""Nerve"" that grew out of me. I come here to confess and help me move on. My psychologist said it helps to write out my thoughts and feelings. So I come here and do that and it helps me understand myself. She told strangers everything about me. All of my flaws and imperfections that are quite frankly humiliating, and they've grown to shame me publicly.. Every fine detail that characterized me as the epidemy of evil and wickedness. Coming here is like going to confession. Where I confess everything. Some things are just feelings, some of them are actions, some of them are just blowing off much steam. Imagine my horror when I realized when my ex-girlfriend'
s words of my imperfections reached a psychology professor, who said it plainly. The professor said it. It was empirical. she sat in the doorway and told me before we even sat down. It could not be denied. My ex girlfriend played a hand in trying to ruin me in an academic setting, where I was shelling out thousands of dollars for her entertainment. She stacked the dominos, and knocked the one over that lead to my collapse as I had to face that professor in her office, because her words got to that professor. The day I got out of the hospital I was a wreck, and I sought my ex-girlfriend's consul, only for her to justify her actions with pithy excuses of how I made her live in poverty, that my paint career is abhorrent, that her ""people"" have been stalking me. And in her weakness, when she was suicidal over her abortions one morning, that she had when she was with me, she sought my consul, and I betrayed her because I told all of you this on this forum. I told nobody else but you guys. Now Imagine if her ""pe
ople"" were watching me when I stated this on this forum, and went on a rant because I felt this ""nerve"" or impulse for Hamletian ""wild justice"" that I had to get off my chest, in private with a confess meant for just my friends here. There was no intention of signaling to her ""people"", outside of this forum. It was just meant for you guys. I then felt paranoia, and reacted with terrible feelings and regret, and guilt, and fear that her ""people"" saw it, but I have no way of finding out. My schizophrenia, my paranoia, makes me feel as though I am always being singled out. Now what if her ""people"" have and read that? This is why I named the character of _PERSON_ first book _NAME_ Daedalus. _NAME_ for the person thrown to the lions, and Daedalus, the person who created a labyrinth. But lately, I feel it to be more of a Gordian knot, that I can't figure out how to untie. I need to sever it, which would be deleting my account here. But you guys are my friends, and I care for you, and you make me more awa
re of myself, and you're part of my support net. I'm just conflicted, and these are my recent thoughts which are stuck in a pattern of thinking which I get fixated on. And then I sit back, and just exclaim I'm cursed, and I feel a bit of acceptance. People, for some reason, single me out, and try to give me the scarlet letter because they are unable to grasp the underlying issues, some of which they could never imagine! Schizophrenics often feel as though they are being ""gang-stalked"" but my ex has given me a reason to feel that, that public shame thrown my way. I don't let it get to me, because if they do then I just understand that their just an instrument in a system of oppression that makes men feel as though they can't seek therapy and talk about their feelings and impulses. Shame is the tool of the mindless herd, where they try to strip a person of their dignity, of their sovereignty within. Guilt and shame are different. Guilt is something I've worked to iron out in every imaginable sense. I have a f
uller understanding of who I am now, and have made great progress. Shame, however, is something that is thrown onto a person in public. It's external, and very effective. It's what drove Faust's love, _NAME_, towards her death. I wish I could just untie this knot, but to do so requires aid from one of my exes' ""people"" that she self-proclaimed. Everytime I get close to an answer, it slips away and drives me ****ing insane!"

174345863,"So I took a walk around town in my pj's - Brought two days worth of meds with me in a container in case I got abducted, wallet, phone. I listened to some really good classic rock music - Talked with people here on snap. I said if anyone approaches me (_PERSON_ I was the only one in town where thousands of people roam in the day), I'd show them the schizophrenia card that I bought on etsy. The reason I did this was because I watched the news. I walked into a gas station and bought a snack, continued walking through the park and then I walked into the gas station to meet my pot head friend who works night shift. We talked about crazy things - The news, world, galaxies, China, Satan, God, religion, bad vibes, energy, etc.. He didn't seem psychotic and reassured me that the world isn't ending because of my bad trip in 2016. Now I'm gonna go to bed - The Invega injection should kick in by tomorrow or the next day. I have to work in the morning so I'm gonna fall asleep (Hopefully) at 4am and wake up at 7
am, take vyvanse, wake up again at 7:30am and I'll have an hour to get ready. Then I'll work and maybe take a nap in the afternoon to get more sleep. Things will be good. I just need to sleep! I'm not worried about my heart much anymore. My friend said to talk to my mom about things. I'm really worried about her - But she has her bf to fling with and keep her company. I think she might be feeling hopeless with her cancer, heart condition and she's in credit card debt now. I have all of my meds and drugs organized and I'm going to keep stable through all of this nonsense and try not to worry about my parents dying from coronavirus, etc.. My dad licked his finger and put it on my forehead and said ""You're a (My last name)"" and to take care of my mom - My immediate reaction was to laugh because it's so ridiculously jinxed but it's true. I need to keep stable and do the right thing. As far as focus goes, I need to do something RIGHT BEFORE the Vyvanse kicks in and then I can focus. If I take it just to wake up, 
I end up just listening to music and getting nothing done. I'm trying guys. I'm trying really hard to not be psychotic. These moments are really testing me but I'm a good person - A really good person. It's my job to take care of my mom and not be mad at her - Even with my trauma and neglect. It's my duty - To take care of my sister and my brother - Make sure my dad has his happiness during his golden years because he's taught me a lot through all of this. Anyone can do is just do the small things - In their own community, all of their opinions mean something to change the world. I'm very individualistic and don't think of myself as normal or opinionated. But I'm good with numbers! Math people are either ""this"" or ""that"".. Creative people are ""This - Depending on this.. and I have to write 20 books about a little bit of it"". I'm kind of both now.. My sister told me about that way of thinking. So I'll sleep now. Hope everyone has a nice morning. I appreciate you all and empathize with your struggles. Esp

175958353,"_PERSON_, I found this today and thought you may find it interesting reading. Love ya! Sassy Bipolar Disorder May Be Strongly Linked with Parkinson’s Disease Recently, researchers in Taiwan found that individuals with bipolar disorder may have a significantly elevated risk of acquiring Parkinson’s Disease (_PERSON_, 2019). The authors followed a cohort of more than 50,000 patients with bipolar disorder at baseline, and compared them over the time frame to healthy controls. What they found was that individuals with bipolar disorder, had a nearly sevenfold greater incidence of eventually acquiring Parkinson’s Disease than those without bipolar disorder. Furthermore, individuals with a history of manic and depressive, or mixed episodes, as well as a history of hospitalizations for bipolar disorder, had a much higher likelihood of acquiring Parkinson’s later on in life. The notion of a bipolar-Parkinson’s link is not new. Prior literature has suggested a link between the two conditions at the 
level of neurotransmitters. One prime example is that of serotonin, which plays a major role in bipolar disorder pathophysiology, particularly with respect to depression. As it turns out, serotonergic activity is also notably reduced in Parkinson’s (_PERSON_, _PERSON_, & _PERSON_, 2016).

Now in her early 50's and along with menopause, her anxiety symptoms are worse than they've ever been. Her anxiety mainly revolves around her health. Every ache or pain, she's researching for answers, but always feels it's something life threatening. She'll almost never try to put her mind at ease by making a Dr's appointment, and getting some answers, as her fear that she might have Cancer or something deadly, prevents her from calling. I've tried every way of supporting her that I can think of, but I'm running out of ideas. I've always been the ultra positive type, but my wife is the ultra negative type, so no matter what I try to tell her, she turns it around into something impossible.

175958403,"_PERSON_ is on two Anxiety forum threads (“Lexipro (or other SSRI’s) and Muscle Twitching” and “Left pectoral muscle twitches”). I’ve had muscle twitching also and did not connect it to medicine for 5 years. But the twitching was connected to a medicine I was taking (Mirtazapine anti-depressant). Net says Mirtazapine is an SSRI which “stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. SSRI antidepressants are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing levels of serotonin within the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is often referred to as the `feel good hormone'”. So when the question arises, does (“Lexipro (or other SSRI’s) [cause] Muscle Twitching” I found the answer to be, yes, Lexipro and other SSRI’s can cause muscle twitching. This is of interest to me because I take an SSRI (Mirtazapine) and I have muscle twitching. I have taken that medicine for five years. For the first 3 years (taking 15 mg.), I made no connection between taking the Mirtazapine at 1
2 midinight, and by toes starting to twitch 30-45 minutes later, plus my appetite increasing to where I had to get up and have a snack. Due to circumstances, the connection dawned on me and my psychiatrist reduced the med to 7.5 from 15 mg and I thought all was taken care of. For the last 2 years on 7.5 mg, I would have occasional toe twitching but it has increased, followed by getting up and having another snack. So I get to bed at 12 midnight, and at 5 a.m. I have yet to get to sleep. Two days ago for the first time, I connected all of that, so I took my Mirtazapine not at midnight, but 5 hours earlier at 7 p.m., hoping the side effects would wear off at midnight, and they did and I slept from 12 midnight to 8 a.m.. about the SSRI Lexapro (treats anxiety and depression net says), Webmd.com says under rare side effects: A Feeling Of Restlessness With Inability To Sit Still Muscle Tremors Cramps And under “Side Effects, 5th paragraph: “twitching muscles”.

h paragraph of Side Effects, it said: ""Twitches. Unlike tics, the majority of muscle twitches are isolated occurrences, not repeated actions. Muscle twitches are also known as myoclonic jerks. They are entirely involuntary and cannot be controlled or suppressed."" So I would say SSRI’s can cause twitching muscles. You also said, “Recently, and even before going back on the Lexapro (after being off of that for 8 months), I’ve had the annoying and worrisome twitches and spasm in my left breast muscle.” Trying to figure out what to do after finding out the SSRI’s can cause muscle twitching I’m finding to also be a problem. I’m trying to take my Mirtazapine 5 hours early. But the twitching toes starts only about an hour or two after taking the medicine, so I maybe I can take it 2 hours before bedtime. Anyway, that’s the situation as I see it."

But they said it would be a travel-trip. So I might have to goto south texas to take it. Like in _NAME_ TX. Which is 5 hours away. . It would be $12/hour . I'd be working with adult patients with depression or bipolar in the beginning. Then they would switch me on and off between that and FEP, which is first episode psychosis patients. . I'd have to travel half the time 30 or more min away to another city tho. But they said I can use the company car. But if I'm working part time then it shouldn't be much of a problem."

175958407,"I thought I would add a little bit more here this morning. When I was going through those psychotic breaks I realized that I was going through a type of long term panic state. I was seeing special meaning in all these events that were happening. The delusion I was having at the time was I thought I was in this contest with this supernatural power or entity. Sometimes things that happened, I saw as a sign that I was losing the contest and then something else would happen and I thought I was winning but the contest was never over. I was seeing synchronistic meaning in almost everything. I listen to this you tube video this morning where the speaker said that when people take psychedelics they start to see meaning in everything. He said that people normally have a filter in their brain that prevents them from seeing meaning in everything otherwise they could never get anything done. I think that it is important to see some meaning in certain things and that our lives have some meaning. I guess I just 
needed to clean or change my filter so I could start to get something meaningful done. Trying to not take things so seriously certainly help me make it through."

There's this weird bit where he thinks he wants to be a serial killer at the beginning and I found out it was because the show was based on a comic where the kid is actually just a sociopath.

175958413,"I know I sound bad. I think I am getting better though, at least for now. For the past few years I just did not even admit my anxiety was ruining my life. I do ok for a few days or a week then things snowball until I have a full blown anxiety attack. If I can calm down and fall asleep after taking my meds then I can somehow reset myself. I don't have much experience handling anxiety. It has just been the past few years that anxiety has gotten the better of me. also my drs have my other health issues to deal with and it seems my anxiety gets the back seat priority. I have pretty bad degenerative disc problems and had spinal fusion and need more in the coming year. I have osteoporosis which makes things even worse. If all that were not enough I have cancer which honestly the last six months has just pushed me over the edge. I will get a handle on this eventually. Covid keeps me from doing things I know would help my anxiety. Not being able to get out makes me upset. I try to help others also. I lost 
my volunteer job at the soup kitchen which was a great help to me also. I felt like I was helping others so much. Thank you all for you help and kindness.Post Edited (oceanfisher58) : 12/25/2020 5:05:56 PM (GMT-7)"

175958432,Re-reading The Silver Linings Playbook by _NAME_ Quick
175958433,"Good afternoon -- I am new to this forum. My 36 year old daughter suffers with internal tremors while sleeping and I believe they are anxiety related since she has been dealing with several chronic illnesses over the years and also had _PERSON_ surgery last year. The surgery was successful but she continues to have these tremors only when resting or sleeping which causes insomnia since she said the tremors are very uncomfortable so she cannot get any rest. She said they are not painful but they keep her awake. Before her surgery last year, she started having these tremors. I feel these tremors are all anxiety related. She has had MRIs of her brain and back. She has had her stomach, her heart, almost all parts of her body tested and they are all negative. In prior years, she was on a lot of antibiotics for one of her chronic illness interstitial cystitis. She feels these tremors are caused by these medications but I feel that she has been sick for so long and worrying about the brain surgery was the 
frosting on the cake for her body to go into flight and fright mode. She feels it is permanent and she wants to give up. I cannot convince her however that it can be anxiety. She had tried to get on medication for anxiety years ago, but these drugs cause her interstitial cystitis to flare up with then causes UTIs. I know this is way to much information but if there is anyone that deals with anxiety and internal tremors in the skull and/or back, please let me know."

175958439,"I was raised in a Lutheran household, then I became an extreme atheist, then an hopeful agnostic, and as I get older the bible speaks to me more. There is power in beliefs, and it's really tough to will oneself to believe in anything, right? I look up at the cosmos, past the dread abyss and dying stars, and I see two choices an individual can make: One can look up and see a world full of meaning, purpose and providence; and then the other choice is the materialist position where this life is all there is, and after we die, that's it, because we were just a random mutation. Personally, I'm drawn to mystery, and I ask weird question like, ""Why does e=mc2, and not some other equation? Science has a difficulty time giving us the 'why' answers--which religions answer. I think this eternal drama we've found ourselves in is confusing since birth. However, the fact that I can feel anything at all fills me with awe sometimes, and a glimmer of hope. I'm drawn that to feel anything, might be proof there is s
omething out there. One thing I find mysterious is the term ""atom."" In greek it means ""indivisible bit,"" Sounds crude that that's what ultimate reality. Yet now we have bits called atoms, but we come to find out we can divide them, and now we get different types or quarks and gluons when we divide further. I just think it's hubris to actually think we can ever know the truth through science, even in principle. Every generation thinks they know it, but this ""stuff"" has been around since eternity? Since God? What are they truly moved by, I ask myself. Here's a quote from _PERSON_ that fills me with hope and wonder. “Spirit by attraction draws Elemental matter, Forges bonds no man can force And no angel shatter. Double natures single grown, Inwardly united, By Eternal Love alone Can it be divided” _PERSON_, Faust"

I’ll be 30 this year). -I believe I’m able to function correctly and live my life with specific meds.

175958445,"It's like: I am already disadvantaged by having a mental illness. Then on top of that I have to take these meds that sometimes work and sometimes don't, pay out the *** for a psychiatrist who doesn't always help me and/or prescribe the right thing, see a therapist who encourages me - I may or may not have a job at any given time, and I basically have to put in double the effort that a ""normal"" person does in any given moment. I am sick of it. That's why I posted the above thing about finding meaning in life. Honestly, the only thing that gives me meaning is studying the Spanish language and writing in it. (Don't tell my family this, wink). Because there are typical reasons that people find meaning in life and sometimes it's like family, kids, etc. My reasons are different.

I know it sounds impossible but anxiety can do this to you for such a long time but, trust me severe anxiety can cause a myriad of symptoms I have to admit that this one has almost gotten the best of me, since I always feel like I’m short of breath and I only get relief if I am sitting or lying down. I have tried a variety of methods to ease this symptom, but only a couple have worked and usually just for a short period of time. Have you taken any anti-anxiety medication? I am about to go to the doctor to get something myself, as I have not been on and off in a long time but feel they have always been very helpful. I wish you luck and conquering this issue.

It is possible to use physics to defy the laws of physics which doesn't make sense until it does, like building a time machine."" It could have some oxymorons in it but other than not wanting to spend my time writing any more of it, it could make sense (If it doesn't). The high dose psilocybin trip made this thinking worse for me in terms of psychosis, but better for me in terms of how interesting the thoughts can be.

Then, turn it into a $#%^ sandwich - a turd hidden between two pieces of bread: ""_NAME_, I really appreciate your friendship; it's been very important to me and I don't know what I'd do without you around, but I have to tell you that you need to take more care of your personal hygiene. I know this is difficult to hear, but you're a terrific person and if you took care of this then imagine how much more effective you'd be?"" Alternatively, be brutally direct. I use this example as it was one I had to deal with. I invited the person into a conference room where we could be alone and said, ""_PERSON_, you stink mate and everyone's talking about it.

I live in a residential community for people with mental illness and the staff right now is saying she ""passed away"" and are not giving any other details. She was very young--only 23 years--and I know she tried to kill herself a month or so ago by taking some pills although she changed her mind at the last minute and called 911. But because of this, I have reason to believe she tried again and went through with it this time. I'm certain if she died from pneumonia or flu or something like that, or was in a car accident, they wouldn't hesitate to tell us what happened. She wasn't a close friend of mine, but she was definitely part of my life and it won't be the same around here without her. She was a devo

I think of anxiety as physical anxiety (I don't get that because of the atenolol) but I suppose I have mental anxiety (Which isn't derealization/depersonalization that used to cause my panic attacks). The thing is, I remember telling her that I liked having mental anxiety because it helps with my personal development - But sometimes I get tired of it and that happens to a lot of people with anxiety... They take an anti-anxiety medication. My mom and her sister (My aunt) have the worst anxiety I've ever seen in a person but my mom functions really well with it.

175958500,"Are anyone of us normal? I think being normal is overrated and boring. You are not alone in how you feel. I have been having the same feelings, for a long time now too. I have negative thoughts, that I think are holding me back trying to find me again. I keep coming up with more questions than answers. I think we just need to sit down and contemplate, to figure out who we are. Try writing things down. Just write what pops into your head. If you wander from one subject to another that's ok. Sometimes it helps. Sending you a big hug"

175958502,"I think my mental health is in decline. My speech is less. I mean I have something to say but I have to search for the words mid way through. My boss gives me an oral assignment and I can't remember it all. My room is never clean, nor my car. So what am I going to do about it? I'll lower my AP to what it use to be, back down to 80mgs of Geodon a day. I'll get high dhs omega 3's (DHS is the brain fat right? _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I'll read something small for 30 minutes like a platonic dialogue, scene in Faust, or a poem. Any other ideas?"

I'm gonna take my stim as prescribed - Because it will be at a good enough dose. I don't know what 2021 will be like. I know it's weird to symbolize how good things are by how fast the Earth turns and spins around the sun but that's what whole of reality is based on - And it's trippingly meaningful. My New Years resolution will be to get out of my comfort zone. Panic attacks are gone!! I'll trust my psychiatrist for now that my creativity/motivation/inspiration will come back with the prescribed meds. Apart from phenibut, I'm not using any drug. I'll leave the psilocybin in the box and try to take BB's approach on things...."

I was just telling my dad like a month ago or two that I feel like God guided me to do all I have for myself as if it was a way for me to get ready to be without my parents one day. Like the urgent feeling I had that I needed to leave my dads house and start my own life. It was because I felt like if I don’t do something now with my life, I’ll never know how to live, period. Idk man. But I also feel like my dad will be ok...idk."
175958522,"Thinking about what SP told me, about a book she is reading about doing things and “things” that bring happiness to your life. I realized I really, really like planning/organizing. Especially my day/week/month. I’m a planner addict but I could never find a planner I could use properly. These ones with these questions in them. I don’t need them. It’s too much for me to sit down and do questions all day everyday. Or not all day but everyday. So those 3 cheap planners i showed u guys, the big ones, the really basic big monthly calendars seems to be working so far. And as I suspected, the mood one isn’t because it’s so many questions and crap to fill out. I hate that honestly. I thought I liked that style. But this is what I have so far: and I need some stickers for it or something to continually organize things... The squares are my daily house chores that I printed out from an example house chore chart from Pinterest. And then I’m slowly filling in my appts and other things..."

175958528,"I have been wondering about this. My first psychosis was at age 25 in 2015. My second psychosis was early last year when I was 29. Before the second one started, I had been crying a lot over having to cut ties with someone. He was very important to me, but I thought it was the best decision to let him. And yet it triggered feelings of an intense grief, despair, hopelesness, like nothing was ever going to be okay again, loneliness, anger about the situation, I never felt such an intense pain before. And I got sleeping problems, and eventually the delusions started. I was randomly in love with someone from YouTube, I thought people were trying to communicate with me through the TV, I thought I was being stalked, things like that. No hallucinations, just delusions and paranoia. And with all that pain I felt, I felt like I was going to die. With the first psychosis, I don't remember a pain so intense but I do remember crying and being upset. Just not the same despair and hopelessness. I also had happy 
feelings (mania). I talked to someone who claims to be a psychotherapist and she said that heartbreak is not considered a trauma (though to me it felt traumatic) people get that all the time without getting a psychosis. And she said that if the psychosises were not triggered by a traumatic event, then it could be Bipolar 1. I was only diagnosed with psychosis twice. I want to be able to understand so that I know how to help myself just in case it happens again. I am still not over all that pain I went through. I do take antipsychothics and antisepressia. What do you all think?"

I faintly recall the feeling of extreme panic/heavy breathing and a sense of needing to escape like the walls were closing in on me. Usually I do not remember my dreams but every time I do its when episodes happen like this, tho usually its not this bad. Most of them involve me seeing huge spiders causing me to throw my blankets on them and I wake up as i'm sifting through it looking for it or me just simply sleep walking. I work nights so i'm usually not going to bed till around 4am. I do not take any hard sleeping pills, if I do take something its stuff like _PERSON_. Can lack of quality sleep cause this?

He says that he'll be done with my apartment at the end of summer, and if there's anything left in there he'll hire a junk dealer to take it. I can't trust myself with the stairs there anymore so I guess I can't really move back. But this is going to cut down on the amount I'm ever going to see my friend. He will have nowhere to stay overnight anymore. I have to figure out a plan to get the keys to him. Otherwise he'll junk all my favorite stuff."

175958547,"Honestly man, I'm going to tell you from personal experience, quitting any psychiatric medication cold turkey is going to put you in a world of hell. I don't know how bad everything is for you, but it's not going to get better. The best thing to do at this point is talk to your doctor about it. I quit Ripserdal and Lexapro cold turkey, years apart, and each time I went through hell. Talking to my doctor about it, he helped me ween off the Risperdal, and I'm back on the Lexapro and started taking it again."

174346112,I mainly relaxed today. I did handle some business today. I also found out that the web site for the food stamps has been down all week.

Nobody gives a single shit about me, thats how i really feel. can we be honest, everyone cares about their own lives, and only really theirs. can we be honest, why is mental health work so fucking expensive?!?

175958573,"I'm glad that the shroom gave me proof of the afterlife. And I was an atheist.. Logical, methodical, to need evidence.. I finally decided what I want to do. Something to do with technology. Like IT and something to do with computers. Then I can continue to think philosophically about the future, time machines, virtual reality, programming our consciousnesses into computers.. I was good at cracking programs when I was a teenager, making forums, making YouTube videos and showing people how to use the most out of programs.. But I stopped and did drugs.. I'm always on the computer and I can bring a computer anywhere with me. That and investing. I can be like my uncle. He's a millionaire from owning his own internet service provider and owns a building with his servers and people working for him and he invests in crypocurrency etc... I could work for him in the future and go to school."
175958574,At the my differentiating I asked my one voice. Called him _PERSON_ to please relate to certain men by sharing his story of having been a convicted felon turned peer specialist . I asked him to relate to several youngs mens song aspiration to not allow it to turn into reality. In no circumstance should either of them judge since 1996 we've trained each other to not allow our demons to take us over. Not our parental side it has worked. The main thing I want them to know as urban males is to not be scared of the culture differences. Why because we're educated and got lucky in life. Don't allow a few bad apples whom you know since 1989 to deter you to mediocries . It has existed since the 80s remember!! REading into much into hate and jealousy does just this is why we have certain others whom protect us advance us in our weaknesses. Is how I'm coping today.
175958575,I wish there was a manual for my life. But I have to figure everything out. And I'm pissed off that I went so mental. I don't know when to enjoy life and when to work hard on what I want. Because I'm not sure what I want. There needs to be some easy points on how to focus with ADHD. I took an extra Vyvanse which makes made me focus on my phone at the restaurant to the point where I couldn't hear everyone around me. But I might lower my original dose so I have more creativity with less focus. Not sure if I want a happy carefree life or to head for success. I don't want to be too egotistical. I do all these things but I'm not doing enough. I can't chill and relax and read a book because I feel like I'm focusing on one thing at once. I need to focus on many things or else I feel anxious about the things that I'm not doing. I need to prioritize my time. I'll go back to my notes on how to sort this all out because I'm losing my mind in a good way because it's needed. But so many people around me in real 
life aren't doing anything to improve anything. They're just drinking all day every day.

175958582,I don't feel depressed but I feel horribly very sad. I've never really felt this sad before. I like it because at least I can feel something. I've felt this sad on methylphenidate crashes but not a dextroamphetamine crash. Usually I avoid them because I just go to sleep when it wears off (It's lasts 12 hours and I sleep 12 hours) but I don't feel tired right now. I'm glad I have all of you to talk to. I think we're all incredibly grateful to have this roll call. Sometimes people say it but I say it now. It's just the music.. The music really. ****ing. Helps.

Did not for me. After a month or so on them I become lethargic. Tired and just sit around. I have a script for Cymbalta and why I’m trying it like Wellbutrin, it supposed to help with pain. What time of day should I take. My sister who is a RN said take at night if all these so far has made me tired. I’m only going to be on 30mg. I know I need “something” because I cry all the time because my disease is so depressing every day (bleeding from my rectum non stop) I’m so anxious to do anything where there isn’t 2 bathroom. I like Wellbutrin cuz I got off it fine, lexapro I had zaps, had to start and stop a few times to make that stop. I understand cymbalta causes major zaps.

175958605,"Thank you for asking this question I'll try to put it in simple terms, so you can visualize the appropriate points. Right the historic term for Zersetzung comes from Vienna in the later 1920s, and most famously by the German public under the Nazi propaganda campaign under the quasi-medical ideology of Eugenics. ( just a titbit of information on modern Psychiatric practices like medications came from this era in time)please if you are at all interested please follow this link, THE BREGGIN'S FIRST AND SECOND VIOLENCE INITIATIVES | Psychiatric Drug Facts It has also been used in recent history as an instrument of control and surveillance as in the cold war communistic countries like Poland and East Germany. The secret Police and Informer based communities who used intimations tactics, psychological warfare to undermind the targets ( victims of state investigations) minds and competence. this is also a form of Gaslighting which could be attributed as a form of zersetzung also. Please follow the link _P
ERSON_: The dark secrets of a surveillance state - YouTube Anyway, the main focus I wanted to convey is the Psycho-Social aspects of what's attributed to _PERSON_. So this would be things like experiencing workplace mobbing, public warming via Snapchat baiting you for a response or looking to film you in compromising situations. (of which are sometimes engineered). This to receiving a strange attitude in life by your local environment. I have put a link that explains it. Zersetzung - Wikipedia Even ostracising someone covertly ( sending someone to Coventry or prolong covert and subtle harassment or humiliation ) Zersetzung.org Home - Zersetzung.org At the end of the day, my main point is that your 'voices' are indeed a very insidious form of Zesetzung. The UN has recently termed the phrase Cyber Torture to explain accounts around the world of people reporting to have suffered from these things. You may have heard the term gang Stalking or Electronic Harassment, Cause Stalking, or Happy slapping, Molka. Think 
within these terms. UN warns of rise of 'cybertorture' to bypass physical ban | Law | The Guardian Please read and follow legitimate resources. the best of luck."

There's something about mindless activity, even while scaling a steep roof with 2 by 4's at an existential risk of dying, that helps me memorize the lectures.

175958619,They closed all libraries and pools here. I wasn’t going to go the pool anyway people are gross. I’m not even going to the gym. They’re still open I just don’t want to go because people are gross. I have some home equipment that I’ll use for the meantime. It’s quiet around the city. Schools are closed for the next few weeks too. Was talking to someone at the mall and they were saying they were cutting hours so the mall might close soon too. Work is still going on but they’re talking a lot about making people work from home so see how that goes. We’re all stocked up on food and stuff (we always are stocked up so it’s nothing out of the ordinary). All my school is online so there’s nothing to worry about that there. I’m not too too worried about it personally but my mom is older so I worry about her. Mentally I’m pretty good. Hard about my dog but we’re better.

175958623,"I meant to reply to this as well, so it didn't get fully lost in the woodwork. It's very unpleasant to feel trapped or hopeless. If you're in crisis or planning to kill yourself, reach out to a crisis line or take yourself to the hospital, etc. Personally, If I wanted any real degree of emotional support - especially for hopelessness/deep discouragement - I wouldn't be searching through these forums because the areas that could offer it (depression subforum, etc) are barely active at this time. I'd call a crisis line or go to my therapist. Not just for bpd anymore, DBT distress tolerance, emotional regulation, interpersonal skills, mindfulness can also be helpful in getting through crisis - as well as for learning skills in the mentioned areas. It's easy enough to find through online searches or YouTube. Counseling as well if you know what would improve your life, and you want clarity and help getting there. Quality of life can always be improved in some way or another if one is committed to it. Ev

174346196,"I once called 911 on the hospital because I legit thought that they were poisoning my food and other things. Think of the meds as what they really are (Antipsychotic medication). They do the exact opposite of LSD, shrooms, mescaline and DMT. Psychedelics can cause hallucinations, dissolving of free will, paranoia, psychosis and delusions. Antipsychotics antagonize serotonin 2A receptors which decreases dopamine. Too much dopamine is in the temporal lobe (Hearing?) which causes voices. Dopamine can go into the back of the head and cause visual hallucinations. Your prefrontal cortex malfunctions. Humans are the only known animal that can get schizophrenia because they have a prefrontal cortex. If you do a lobotomy and severe the front of the brain, you become a zombie. Antipsychotics can make you feel like a zombie but not at moderate doses which usually work for psychosis. There's also spirituality that you can think about when you're not so scared. I couldn't sleep last night and was going slightly 
psychotic but thankfully the Seroquel kicked in and I could go to sleep. I imagine things in my head and it just turns out into suicidal, homicidal, weird thoughts because I also have obsessional OCD and intrusive thoughts. It's the dissolving of free will. Free will is an illusion and animals don't think about what we're doing. But we do. We are the most advanced form of life and we think too much. Remember, no one is in control. If you look at earth from a spaceship, you're just watching a bunch of monkeys fighting over different Gods and killing each other. Hippies doing psychedelics from love and the bad trip, coming from hate and repressed traumatic memories in the subconsciousness from what evil people did. It's easy to be cynical, or think people are out to get you from environmental factors of what has happened to you and the thoughts that you think. Thoughts are hallucinations but you have to trust your thoughts. You don't trust your thoughts and you are lucid. Without the meds, you could lose insigh

175958626,"Anyone else like weapons? I keep them stashed inside my walls because my last hiding place got found (underneath my dresser drawer). Possible trigger: I had a machete, a hammer, a pipe, some knives and screwdrivers hidden under there, but my grandmother found it and took all of it so now I've got to start all over again, except this time there's less stuff for me to steal around the house and hide. Since I don't have access to guns, all I've been able to get are knives and other tools and the like. As of right now, all I've got hidden are some pocket knives, boxcutters, multitools, a flathead screwdriver, and a reciprocating saw blade that I fashioned into a knife by folding a rag in half, wrapping it around the bottom and electrical taping it to form a grip, like a kabar. And an old kitchen knife. My family aren't apathetic parents, instead my parents are so overprotective that when I gave up after they found my stash that last time and the old house door was locked, I took a rusty old metal sprin
kler and started to beat it against a cinder block and anvil to make a straight pipe, but my mom crept up on me and took it and after she did that, I desperately tried to get it back because that was the only thing laying around the yard that I had that could be used as a weapon. I was frantic. Now, whenever I think about this stuff, I fly into a rage breaking things in the yard or even inside (like the countless holes I knocked through the walls when I get upset), because I just want what everyone else has. My little brother shoots guns and has all types of knives and yet they'll confiscate any kind of weapon and hide it from me, including a machete or just a regular knife and they essentially treat me like a child and it pisses me off. That's one of the millions of reasons why I want to go away from there, but I can't because nobody else in my family has any room for me to move in with. I don't have a job or a car either, but cause they don't trust me with money or anything and it just enrages me to the poi
nt that I've destroyed their whole garden, all their outdoor lights, pretty much everything to the point that they had to start over from scratch and rebuild their whole yard. It's getting to the point to where I might have to bury my weapons somewhere in the backyard. Does anyone else have a fascination with weapons? Because I do."

175958629,Hi Welcome to the forum. It can be difficult to decide what to do when it comes to medication so you need to do what's right for you and talk things through with your psychiatrist.

175958641,"Now lets continue with inmytree1988. From my experience, medication isn‘t an enemy. I also was very skeptical about the first time my psychiatrist suggested it to me. I was scared because I knew about some side effects, that I didn‘t want to get. But I am so glad that we found the right medication for me, because it really made a difference. I take something for anxiety and depression and after a few weeks of consistently taking it, I felt a lot better. The thing is, you shouldn‘t expect the first medication, that‘s given to you to be working immediately. Sometimes you have to try one and see if it‘s right for you. If not, go to your doctor and try a different one. I had to try two different medications first, before we found this one I‘m taking currently which is working really well. If you‘re very concerned about the possible side effects, tell that your doctor, they will really explain everything to you and clear up your concerns. One thing you really need to take into consideratio
n is, that medication isn‘t magically taking your problems away, it only supports you and gives you some feeling of lightness in your life. But it is still you, who has to work on your issues. Medication can only make it a little easier. I heard from some people that for them it wasn’t the right thing and it didn‘t work, but again it depends on you, it takes patience to find the right medication and for it to work. It could totally be the right thing for you or not, but you have to try it to know. One last thing on being scared that it doesn‘t work and that you will always be like this... man it‘s tough, I understand that this feeling can be so crushing and heavy and I don‘t know what to say to this here as a comment (and I don‘t know what‘s going on in your personal life)... and just saying something like: „You‘ll be okay“ and „Things aren‘t as heavy as you might think“, are just empty phrases tbh. So the only thing I can say is, that you aren‘t alone and trying things out can r
eally make a difference."

175958647,"For stomach anxiety what had worked for me in the past is meditation and breathing exercise, also general physical maintenance. Professionals will put you on meds. Which if you are going through a severe period I think can be ok, kinda like a band-aid. But you can't keep it on for too long.... and it doesn't fix the problems anyway. If you want to get better, you need to work it out. Like physical fitness, you need to work your mental fitness. And just like physical fitness, it can be a lot of work. It's easier with other people, find group therapy, meetups that gather to do exercise/meditation/anything. Easier in bigger cities where lots of meetups occur. It worked well for me. Until I stopped, which, is up to you. Good Luck. Oh and I say meditation/breathing for stomach anxiety because a lot of the work from those come from centering your energy into your stomach area and then releasing it evenly through your body. Imagine your stomach like a furnace, that keeps your body comfy. If your fire burn
s out, or starts raging, your whole body is out of whack."

175958714,"I've been doing poorly. I had two days last week where I felt calm (Monday and Tuesday). And then it's like everything hit me. Depression, Anxiety, Panic attacks, suicidal thinking, urges to self-harm, and physical health stuff too, a touch of a stomach bug, a sore throat, an earache. It was like can this get any worse. I took Friday off of work last week because I just couldn't deal. I did go to the movies with my parents this weekend, and I visited a friend. I also texted some friends and let them know I wasn't okay and stuff like that, and they each texted me back. It was really hard getting through the weekend. On Saturday my Mom asked me if I wanted her to take me to the hospital, but I didn't want to go. Then Sunday I got a really bad migraine so I was sick for about half the day. I rested most of the weekend. Spent a lot of time in bed trying to get away from the dark thoughts that were enveloping me. I'm back at work today. I thought I would come back to a lot of paperwork, but actually, no
t that much. I did have to take some anxiety medication this morning though. I had to get some blood work done this morning too. It's always hard because of the SH scars on my arms, and plus I had some still healing wounds from 15 days ago. But the lady taking the blood didn't say anything. They usually don't. I wonder what they think though. I see Pastor _PERSON_ tonight. I hope it goes okay. I sort of have my verse memorized, but not all the way. It's kind of long. It's actually a block of 5 verses. I want to communicate to him how much pain and distress I've been in these past days but I don't know if I can. I don't know that he *gets* it. I see regular _PERSON_ on Saturday. Kind of long until then but oh well. Then I have an appointment on Wednesday, a telehealth appointment with an RN. So we will see how that goes. She's trying to coordinate my care. Sometimes it is so hard to pretend everything is okay when everything is NOT okay. HUGS kit"

174346364,"If I wasn't on a dopaminergic stimulant, I wouldn't be taking the antipsychotic because of risk of muscle movement disorders. That would be really ****_NAME_ up for me to have movement problems. But then I might be psychotic. I like to believe that I don't have schizophrenia and that I'm autistic. It's the only thing that gives me a bit of hope about this. No cure? What if I don't have it!? That's even better! (If there legit will never be a cure no matter what). Vyvanse prevents tolerance to the Invega and Invega prevents tolerance to the Vyvanse.. And yes there's different types of schiz with different cures."
174346371,"I have tried 3 different anti psychotic drugs. The first was abilify- worked great but bad weight gain, I was listed as frail and a year later was almost touching obese line. I reluctantly stopped taking it cause it helped . I sure am Losing this weight much slower than I piled it on. It has been proven to also cause gambling problems. The next one was vraylor. My dr gave me a months worth of samples/ they made me aggressive. The last one is Latuda. Recently started that one and already missed few doses. I guess u can check on samples of vraylor. I was put on anti psychotic to help control borderline personality impulsiveness that usually involves suicide in my case."
175958716,"I feel like DHA/EPA omega 3 fish oil pills take just a few days to start working. I've been taking them on and off for almost 7 years now - Mostly 1 a day, sometimes 4 a day. The only problem that I have is that it can thin the blood which can cause heart palpitations when I'm trying to sleep at night? I'm not sure.. But yeah I think that fish oil pills are more important than I thought they were. Most of the brain is made of DHA? ""DHA comprises over 90% of the omega-3 fatty acids in your brain and up to 25% of its total fat content"". I thought.. These fatty acids MUST cause neurogenesis in the brain just like psychedelics can - Because it feels the same (When I take 4 a day) - I'm able to focus on reading without problem even when the Vyvanse wears off (It helps with ADHD). I haven't been taking them for a week or so and I just CAN'T read like I keep skim reading everything which isn't good and it's painful. But there's studies that say that fish oil does cause neurogenisis - "" Omega-3 fatty ac
ids upregulate adult neurogenesis"", ""Research Brief: DHA Promotes Neurogenesis, Neurite ..."", etc.. Fish oil seems to work better for me than microdosing psilocybin."

I get sick from the flu vaccination. I cant eat a lot of different varieties of foods because most foods make me sick. I was a preemie baby. 5 weeks early. My mom drank when she was pregnant with me. I was around smokers. I have kidney issues. I have issues with my bones, my menstrual cycle, my skin, and other things. I have problems with my teeth, my hair, and my breathing and gait and I have issues swallowing correctly because of the chiari malformation

Perhaps some of this comes down to me not being afraid to die young...sounds peaceful to me..."" You would think so, wouldn't you? I'm not afraid to die either and several years ago decided to drink myself to death, so I set out to do it. One morning I woke up with alcoholic hepatitis and was so sick the last thing I wanted to do was die. It was mid-July and I was in bed curled up in a blanket with chills, then 15 minutes later I''d have the sweats. I didn't take the blanket off though because I knew 15 minutes later the chills would return. I went to the ER with the intent on being admitted, but my PCP said no. This was something I had done to myself so go home and tough it out, tough guy, which is exactly what I did. I quit drinking 24 years ago when I got HepC. Now I have ""moderate cirrhosis"" and HE, or hepatic encephalopathy. Never heard of it? Me either or I would have got treated for HepC a lot s
ooner. It's something you may not have heard about either but might want to give careful consideration to: https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatic-encephalopathy-2 I'd rather have died of liver cancer than succumb to HE, but that's off the table for now and suicide isn't in me so I'll deal with it just like I always do.

175958781,"Hey there… thanks for reaching out, I admire how strong you’ve been all this time. Let me just say I used to love alcohol. Like, LOVE it, I’d have a strong mixed drink every night, usually 2 beers every day, and wine a bit as well. Let me just say, taking it to school in a metal cup was not the best idea. I didn’t get caught by anyone there… a lot of the kids noticed but thankfully didn’t tell the teachers. I went for like over 6 months like this, and I felt the same way you do now. Made such a huge difference, I felt so much better and happier, but as the effects kept wearing off with time, had to keep having more. School was very stressful, which was why I brought it in. However, eventually my mom caught me. As in, another parent alerted her… I kept drinking, but not at school. And while it seemed effective… looking back it wasn’t worth it. I mean, it did help at the time. But now… I can’t hardly have alcohol at all. I think I had my life’s amount in less than a year. Now, 
if I have more than an inch in a glass of alcohol, I get a pain right where my liver is. I’ve gone a while without drinking, still is that way when I do. If it’s a strong one, it hurts worse. If it’s light, I may not notice it right at first. But it’s always there if I drink. Probably not the best thing, seeing as I’m not even 20 yet… and was 14-16 when I was heavy on it. There’s definitely nothing wrong with easing out of a hard day with some alcohol, but I’d recommend looking for better options. For example, NA beer instead of regular – tastes almost the same! Or, a light wine cooler instead of straight wine… or a weaker mixed drink vs. too strong. You’ll be glad in the long run if you do this… You’ll be able to have alcohol longer without the intense pains. And no, it’s not stupid at all to do. I sympathize completely because I used to be that way. It was one of a few bad coping strategies I had. It isn’t good for your health, just gonna say that as it is, but no judgements he
re. That’s just a fact. And I completely agree with you. I am a Christian, but religion rarely works as a way to get through these feelings. I had to have a therapist, counseling and medication. Being a Christian didn’t fix this for me. I used to think it made my life perfect. I felt so much better, it relieved my anxiety, I was actually happy, and I loved the feeling. But in the long run, now I’m so annoyed that I can’t have much more alcohol anymore. So yes, I felt the same way as you did. By no means am I here to preach to you, but here’s a link you may want to check out. I know you’re not a Christian, but just watch it with an open mindset. This video has completely changed the way I view life, and even if you’re not a believer, it may help you, as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOkuZpZKVpo ... and like I said I’m not sure if it will help you or not.

I bet you can even find specific interest groups for people who are dealing with bipolar disorder, like a book club where you read and talk about books to do with mental illness, or where you read and discuss social anxiety.

175958800,"I have finished binge-watching several t.v. series: Derry girls, Dr Foster, The london Irish, Big little lies, Killing Eve, Fleabag Fleabag and Killing Eve are excellent darkly humorous portrayals of dysfunctional characters, predominantly female. I cannot help but think the sexy music in 'killing eve' greatly contributed to the viewers 'falling in Love' with _PERSON_ ( female psychopath). I am trying to imagine watching it without this music and it would not have been as engaging. The sound track is predominantly chosen from the album by 'unloved' called 'guilty of Love'. This is a song from the album https://youtu.be/_3bxRzhIvfM Cant fail at making this psychopath seem sexy. Unrealistic of course but great escapism."

175958805,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH ######6 therapy is too long how can you go from a person believing he is healthy to someone who has an illness and his disability will make him weaker than he has ever thought he is???? i can't describe how hard it is to hear that therapy is going to be long and things aren't going to change in a second, im so used to geting what i want in a second, you know you just say ""this is the new me now"", you put on a new mask and off you go... and suddenly its all taken away from you i dont know what type of therapy it is, im with a psychologist and we just talk about whatever comes out to mind i sometimes have this thing you explained, sometimes i get too close to my therapist and there is a voice that says 'who is she anyway? she doesnt matter, why does she think she can say whatever she wants and you have to listen because she is a professional? so what?' it used to happen alot, it does happen today, i sometimes cant see it coming, i'll be going to my session with no special feel
ing and suddenly im all hostile, not wanting to talk, or thinking to just leave mid-session since i don't see a point in being there following emotions is so strange to me because they can just pull me to different directions moment after moment, you never know what to expect, i can be cooperative for a whole session and suddenly 1 thing she says triggers me off and im mentally leaving session, but physicly saying just for the sake of not wasting another session (i feel alot of sessions end up wasted because of those sudden mistrusts)"

174346489,"Yeah it does. I remember getting in trouble a lot in middle school because I didn't take the rules seriously anymore. I was then given the same lines to write out 50 times or just to sit alone for making fun of the principal. It was all harmless jokes. Then I got to high school and I became really scared of everything (Because I was the most popular in middle school). That's basically when my negative symptoms started. Also when my mom cheated on my dad. She told me in front of him and the dream state just shattered. I was in reality by then, picking up pieces of glass with blood on them because my dad wrecked the kitchen. Then I took psychedelics and now it's like I'm starting that dream state all over again. I feel like something is going to break the dream state again.. And I'll be anhedonic, accepting of how realistic culture makes mundane life out to be and what is expected of me by society."
175958808,Made some decaf coffee. Listening to upbeat songs now. Going to finish my book tonight. Then play Animal Crossing and watch stuff on Netflix. _PERSON_ panic creeping up but I'm doing all I can to keep it from starting and it seems to be working so far

175958816,You could try focalin again but very low dose like as much as a coffee would be.. increase a little norepinephrine.. (This is very very unprofessional opinion but out of empathy for your tiredness cuz tiredness is my worst enemy..). Ask your psychiatrist what he can do. Also splashing very cold Canadian water on your face helps too. Or cold shower of cold Canadian water that increases norepinephrine in the brain by 3x. I feel tired today too. And unfocused. The Vyvanse didn't wake me up this morning. I drank an energy drink but it didn't do anything. Das the price of being on APsychotics.
175958817,"From my experience psychiatrist's define your level of ""illness"" by how objective you can remain with the hallucinations. Personally I have never had hallucinations, but I have what I call conversations, which sometimes happen all day. I suppose they have little effect on my life other than the fact that I can't really think of anything else. These seem real to me although I don't care because whats the difference. I guess its hard to explain the way I think about it. I think generally ones objectivity/distance to this stuff grows with time and medication at least in my case it did."
175958818,"I am leaning on _NAME_ side to not get a dog but to get a cat instead. I would look for a place in your hometown where you could get a kitty.

175958820,"Ever since my freshman year of high school I’ve been seeing, hearing, and mostly feeling things that just aren’t there. What happens almost everyday is that I will feel spiders, ants, or some other type of bug crawl on me and I will try to shoo it away; but there are no bugs there. Tonight was especially strong. I was washing dishes and I looked in the reflection of one of the pot lids. I saw the curtains open, so i made a mental note to close them after i put dishes away. I stand up to close the curtains not even a second later and they were closed. I also kept hearing knocking, squeaking, and other weird vivid noises. I also kept feelings spiders crawl around my neck and on my knee. I checked my neck multiple times, but only my necklace was on there (per usual). While writing this blog i just thought I saw a spider on my pillow and jumped. I do not know if I’m going crazy, if I am crazy, or what. This has been going on for years, but it has never been so bad that it has kept me up for multi
ple nights in a row. I would really love some advice to help me on the right track."

174346531,"My first time when I was 18 was the only time that I liked it - Right after I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and released from the hospital. It made me laugh like crazy - I had a white out, kept forgetting things (Needed to write on my hand), saw 100 faces in the clouds - colours, thought loops, etc.. Now when I smoke it, it can allow me to doooo things.. Although it can make me paranoid or have a panic attack so I stay away for now."

175958837,"I've been having difficulty with my youngest daughter. She kept running away and sayings things that didn't happen, although I'm not sure if she truly believes it happened. Recently, I saw her picture online selling her services. I reported it to police but because she's 17 in NY she can be with any adult and have sex. She's not aware that I know this. In the past year she has been in a group home and has gone AWOL several times. The pain of her not being with the family is immense. Last year I tried to commit suicide and I was angry I was brought back to life. I didn't want to live because she was having a difficult time and I didn't know how to help her. One day she was angry with me and started cursing, I decided that day I didn't want to live anymore. People say 'not to take it personally' or 'you've done a good job with the other children' or 'she needs me and the other children needs me'. I suffer from depression, and I was sexually abused as a child. I grew up feeling that the only reason I 
lived was to please men. I've been married more than 25 years and my husband has been there for me, but not this time. We disagree about our daughter and what is happening to her. I try to stand up to him and tell him how I feel but I'm a coward. He takes over the conversation and starts to say mean things to me which gives me more a reason to die. Yes, I've done medication, therapy and hospitalizations. Currently I have a therapist and on medication but I really don't want to live. Honestly, hospitalization does not work for me. I don't want to live. I don't even know why I'm writing this, I guess I'm in so much pain and I want someone out there to know."

One of the best ways to overcome this type of binge is with support and accountability from those around me.

There doesn't seem to be any fix for them i just try to tolerate them, if it wasn't so hot outside i could stay out there but it is much to warm. 4 yrs ago i would have red fungus that would crawl on my keyboard and cover my hands when i was typing but that has not been a problem in a long time.

175958874,"The ""left"" and the ""right"" ultimately both work for the same sponsors, people and institutions so wealthy that failure to work for those sponsors would render them as politically viable as the Libertarian Party. The same role they always play, catering to the whims of the central banks and the major shareholders of the handful of media conglomerates that control Hollywood, publishing, social media and streaming sites, amusement parks, entertainment franchises such as sports and gambling, etc. People of all ages (except, at least to date, _NAME_) die every day of a variety of things. The sugar example may have been poorly chosen, but I'm sure I could find ""scientific"" studies from back then that supported the ""deadliness"" of dietary fat, such as butter and coconut oil, while ignoring the evils of sugar, which I have proven to myself. I'm too lazy to look these up right now, but I've read of enough cases in which medication for a variety of conditions was hastened through the FDA approval pro
cess, only to be recalled after a significant number of fatality-related lawsuits. After all, at one time, DDT and thalidomide got thumbs-up, just like glyphosates. The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male was as real as was Project MKUltra. With enough money, a given entitiy will find no shortage of science Ph.Ds. willing to say whatever they're paid to say. Academia and research are infernally competitive for funding, to the degree that one doesn't have to search deeply or for long to find instances in which scientific integrity was the first thing sacrificed. The authorities cannot be trusted. We're on our own. What I posted may simply be my ""luscious paranoia"" at work. However, the technology I mentioned exists, and I can't name a major instance in history when such potentially powerful tools, once created, were not used. My mother caught and survived the Hong Kong flu: ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_flu_pandemic ). I survived what I now realize was near-fatal food poisoning eati
ng my usual shrimp dish from a New Haven Chinese restaurant, survived a suicide attempt and a broken back, survived cancer. My late grandfather lived to 92 on absolutely no medication, with an incredibly sharp mind, despite a lifetime smoking Camel straights; working for decades without sunscreen on the open ocean in the equatorial sun wearing a tank top as a shirt--despite not being one, he was as a dark as any African American; with exposed asbestos under his kitchen sink; eating sunnyside-up eggs with butter nearly every day, bloody rare steaks often, and drinking scotch. He openly defied every FDA recommendation, ate what he wanted, lived the way he wanted, and had but one remedy for everything from clinical depression to eczema, ""Swim in the ocean."". I come from a long line of real men and women who did not jump when told to. I will not kowtow to any authority. If it's my time to get sick and/or die, I'm fine with that. Eternal life would not be my idea of a good time, and I'm not about to modify my be
havior just because some turd in a lab coat who couldn't stand eye-to-eye with my grandfather tells me to. However, anyone even tempted to call me selfish, irresponsible, or amoral should also refrain from criticizing China's Social Credit System, aiming as it does for exactly the same thing: neighbors policing each other for the purpose of centralized social control."

I really like both of them and have absolutely no good reason to feel tense around them. But by the time they left I had a terrible headache which I still have. I think most people would say I am friendly and fairly outgoing but that’s not how I feel. I wish I could give you a solution to this problem but I really don’t have one. I have tried therapy but never felt much benefit. I’m also an adult child of an alcoholic and I do blame some of my insecurities on the way I grew up. Perhaps someone else might be able to shed a light on our problem. I sure hope so! One more thing...I also felt nervous talking to my therapist.

175958888,"I can't say just what your condition is, I'm not qualified for that. But I do know how it feels to be separated from your emotions. After a great deal of loss, I feel numb inside. That is something I do not share very often. I don't feel any lack of compassion towards people, but it's hard to feel much emotion. But my personal opinion is that it's just the mind's way of protecting itself. I don't worry about it tho, I think that emotions recover in their own time. I'm also a lot older than you are, so I've become more patient with myself. I know that answers don't always come as quickly as we want them to."

Apparently my sister is going to her husband's parents in Washington state for Thanksgiving too. I think she always does. So itll just be my mom and stepdad I guess. I mean idk what to say. Normally I'd be not ok but fiances parents house is pretty much in _USER_ID_. Half of it anyway. So I cant say no. But I am going to see my dad. My moms an hour and a half away.

I'll give a brief history: Last March is when I started believing nuclear war was coming but it's also because I read a book about nuclear war so it's not like my mind just came up with the idea myself. I started getting paranoid and staying inside all the time, didn't work. My apartment was so messy there was rotting garbage hidden under piles of trash. I thought the police were out to get me and the government was spying on me. I thought a black chevy suburban parked outside was the fbi. And I know it sounds like schizophrenia but I also go MUCH of the day or even a whole week not believing these things. My parents sort of forced me to see my old psychiatrist who diagnosed me bipolar 2 a long time ago. I hadn't seen him or taken medications since march. My parents sort of forced me to go because I had ordered 500 dollars worth of survival equipment and believed north kor
ea was about to strike and drove to my parents and they got annoyed. I also have had a problem with showering. The thing is, these issues have been mild for the last week and a half which is one reason I feel like maybe they are right. I only get the bad paranoia after 4 or 5 pm and hear myself talking to me. But I know its a voice inside my brain, like my inner self talking to me. I also will listen to others when they say I'm being paranoid or not thinking clearly so if I really had schizophrenia wouldn't I not be able to tell the difference? One things is I have terrible terrible memory problems and I wonder if that's one reason I'm having these issues. But anyways, my symptoms are on and off. They come and go. They're not all the time like I've read about schizophrenia."
175958900,Just curious. I do. I really do.

175958912,"Hi, _AT_MENTION_, I started out with the radio sound. I thought it was coming from a neighbor with their window open. Or sometimes I thought maybe the sounds were coming from a school nearby using loud speakers for one of their functions. Then I started hearing music, & again I thought it was coming from someone else's radio. I eventually realized the sounds were coming from inside my own head. After that, the sounds continued to evolve. I think some part of the brain was learning during this evolvement, using memory to imitate sounds, maybe for self entertainment. Thank you for sharing your experience. I wonder how many people hear the radio or tv sound?"

175958918,"I have all of them. I am getting low on one that needs a prior authorization for the insurance but that's in the works. It's cuz of hallucinations telling me things about them. I can't make myself take them. I keep trying to get myself to take them, and I just can't do it. I'm gonna take them with me to PHP in the morning... I don't know what they can do to help me with it but at least I'll have them with me in case. I want to take them, I really do, but the stuff the demons are saying is too real. I can't get over what they are saying. My anxiety and paranoia spike every time I try to take the meds. To panic attack level. The nurse at church offered to help me take a thorazine and I freaked out right there in the lobby of the church with everyone standing around. She had to pull me into the office to tell me it was okay if I didn't take it. She's the one that said I should take my meds with me tomorrow... she wants me to text her tomorrow with how it goes. I'm worried they are going to admit me. I 
don't think they can admit me just for not taking my meds but the other stuff going on, that has been going on for a while, in addition to this, is what worries me. Not sleeping, suicidal thoughts with a plan (but no serious intent to act on it), command hallucinations... The whole combination, with the not taking my meds now, just screams ""admit me."" I don't know what the doctor is going to want to do... Or the T. The T has said he won't force me to go to the hospital, but I'm scared this will be the last straw for him. Especially if I can't make myself take the meds tomorrow... Even with their help..."

175958934,"I'm soooooo happy meeting my cousin. We get along really well. She moved to the city here and will be visiting more. I love my extremely dysfunctional family <3 My mom was talking about why she and my dad are divorced and how a previously married man (Her bf) said to his wife that he wants my mom even though they were just friends.. and my sister reading a text from my dads almost 30 year old hoe saying ""I miss you daddy"" in spanish... stuff like that.. All I've been doing the past 3 days is talking, hiking, going to restaurants and having coffee. I took my cousin to the top of one of the mountains to see the mountain range. We had a lot of laughs cuz we're all funny people. My mom is getting a bit stubborn about her breast cancer and taking her beta blockers. She's not dwelling on it anymore and just living as normal which is a good sign I suppose because it's likely stage 2 and they'll take a lymph node to see if it's stage 3. She'll definitely do radiation but might refuse chemo. I cleaned my 
room at midnight and will sleep soon. I put the water and meds closer to my bed so I can wake up earlier by reaching to my bedside table and taking the Vyvanse easier then go back to sleep. I think that's considered abuse of the medication but there's nothing else I can do. The mornings are really bad for me and I always feel better at night. I feel more social and my medications are adjusted perfectly. I smoked a bowl of temple CBD strain this morning and one in the evening. In between that, I took a few puffs of pineapple express high THC strain. Whatever I'm doing with my meds and drugs, I'm doing it right and want this feeling to last forever. My mom's friend with bipolar looked like she was having a hard time when we were all at the restaurant. She wasn't saying much which isn't like her at all and was self conscious about herself. I should have talked to her more but usually she is the one that is always hyper. She works two jobs and seemed depressed so I'm gonna talk to her the next time I see her and 
tell her positive things. I said that she is family."
175958935,"It is varying. Today, I was calm, doing remote learning with my son (schools are shut down and my county is ""shutting down"" on Saturday) but then my poor husband, came into the kitchen and started eating and drinking. I felt the sound he was making was at an undesirable level so unfortunately, my calmness went out the window. I tried to calm myself, I tried to talk myself down, I tried thinking of all the wonderful things that he does and how blessed I am to have him and how much we love each other. I tried removing myself from the room. But he followed me talking. And he kept chewing, swallowing. I know it's ridiculous. I asked him to chew quieter - swallow softer, he laughed and said he wasn't loud. And I said please, and he laughed again, saying I was being silly. Then I got so upset. I started crying and I yelled at him. He's use to these outbursts, so he tends to not take them to heart but I don't want to have them at all. And when it comes to the noise thing, I can pinpoint down to specific 
situations as a child, that has caused me to react this way. I can't stand repetitive sounds, and when I was a child, if I sang a song more than once or banged on a drum or anything that was repetitive, my father would SCREAM at me. The same thing w the eating, I can actually remember having a really bad head cold and having problems swallowing my dinner. You know when your stuffed up and have to kind of gulp air and really choke food down? I was doing that, and my father screamed at me to stop. At the next bite of food, I did it again and he got so angry he told me he wouldn't let me eat if I couldn't eat properly. Those types of moments were frequent growing up. And I think subconsciously, I am so worried about upsetting someone with those types of sounds that I don't want anyone to do that. When I'm at work, if I'm eating cucumbers or crackers, anything crunchy, I actually pause, and apologize to anyone around me about all the noise I'm making and ask if I'm bothering them. I know it's crazy, I've been tol
d that. But boy that's a hard thing to break. I'm not making excuses for my behavior, I realize, after, that quite often my reaction is irrational or excessive. I understand that. I'm trying."

175958949,"I had a good talk with my sister about my mom. I told her about personality disorders and such and she says that my mom fits Histrionic PD perfectly. I said that I want my mom to be happy and we know that she's trying to change - It's just apart of her getting older and realizing who she really is - Without an abusive partner manipulating her. One of the symptoms is that ""They may seek treatment for clinical depression when romantic (or other close personal) relationships end"". I told my sister about how every philosophical practice or whatever always has it's positives and negatives.. The _NAME_ Empire.. The American Empire.. All can come crumbling to the ground. Idk.. My sister asked if I would be ok when she leaves.. I said that I need to leave too.. My sister doesn't want me to be sad. I said that I want to make enough money and travel the world as well with good friends and have a good life. I don't want my mom to be sad - But we have to leave the nest and she has to accept that. I said that 
I don't want to be 40 living in my moms basement playing video games - My sister said that I'm not old and I have lots of time and no one is going to think that I'm a failure. And not that being those things are a failure either - As much as my mom wants to be close, she's not going to do that - Besides.., She would be like 70 years old at that time. I don't think she'll live to be 70.. She might idk.. I thought about saying to my sister when she leaves (When I was suicidal last night) that I won't be ok. I'll try to be ok.. We'll still text and talk on the phone and visit every now and then. My sister just wants me to be ok."
175958950,"In looking through the search engine for the cause of _USER_ID_ hypothalamus, I came across a psychology today article which referred to this condition as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. I do believe that could be what it is. I found the article very interesting. Here is the address: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201809/how-ptsd-and-trauma-affect-your-brain-functioning You can copy the above and put it on the address bar, and the article comes up on the screen. Here is a summery of what the article says: Research suggests that the brains of people with PTSD differ from brains of those without PTSD in two main ways: • They are hyperactive to threat (_USER_ID_). • They have difficulty regulating or damping down anxiety and anger (medial PFC). Effective treatments for PTSD seem to address these brain dysfunctions by either decreasing the reactivity of the _USER_ID_ or increasing the ability of the PFC to calm it down. Therapists who are trained to recogni
ze and treat the signs of PTSD can be much more effective in reducing the considerable suffering associated with their trauma experience. Educating patients about their symptoms and the neurobiology of PTSD can be de-shaming and increase their self-compassion and sense of control. From reading the above ""They have difficulty regulating or damping down anxiety and anger,"" I think they were fooled once by trusting humans as a child, and got slaughtered in the process, they are now quite understandably overly cautious of humans and vow never to let their guard down again when around people."

Just can't focus. Antipsychotics really help with this - And possibly mood stabilizers.. But I've never been on a mood stabilizer so I don't know. A PRN antipsychotic like olanzepine really helps my mind to relax, puts the fire out and allows me to focus. That's why I take ""mind rests"" so often during the end of the Invega injection cuz it's like putting a lead blanket over my mind and shutting it out from the world of nonsense, calms my thoughts. ^ Look at this writing!

175958955,"Hello everyone. This is new for me to discuss but it’s alittle less intimidating to type than to say out loud. I suffer from social isolation. I also suffer from attachment disorder. I have been this way since a child. Staying to myself engulfed in my own thoughts makes me feel safe. I do have PTSD and abandonment issues which all of this eventually ties together. I’m just tired of being alone, I hate it but I can’t help it. It’s all I know. My social skills are trash so making friends and maintaining them is not easy at all. I am always in my head about every little detail that isolating myself makes it alittle more easier to deal with. Now that I am getting older (27) I’m starting to realize that I cannot continue to live like this. I want friends I want a family, But change is easier said than done. It’s harder than most people think. I can’t just go out and be more social or accept invites from friends (which I have none). So all the research and online solutions have led me to th

He has one receptionist who has met me exactly one time and wouldn't remember me I'm sure and a therapist who is also his wife. Well I think they are married, he calls her his sweetie normally but I think once he said she is is wife. Although she must use her maiden name as her professional name because it's different than his or she just didn't take his last name. I've met her exactly once and I'm sure that she wouldn't remember me either. I tried in the note to explain about the demon bothering me last week and that Pastor _PERSON_ thinks it is a hallucination or delusion (he didn't say which he just said, not real) and annoyingly so said that I was using that to make excuses for wanting to hurt myself. Nope. Was not. Those were not my thoughts! They might have been in my head but they were not my thoughts. So when _PERSON_ ge

175958991,I have been having anxiety and panic attacks since the age of 15. It left me for a long while. Now it’s back with a vengeance. I have a terrifying fear I’m going to have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. I’ve had over 6 EKG in the past 5 months. All normal. But I can’t help myself. I’m constant checking my blood pressure and pulse. Touching my chest. I can’t calm down. Im 27 years old. No known heart problems.
175958992,"I hope my Vapewild stuff came today. 3 boxes of coils and a 30ml of Stardust, and a 30ml of Ry4Life. I replaced the coil and filled with my current bottle of Ry4Life. For some reason juices that I think are great for ADV become terrible quickly. I vaped a tank of Wrangler when my flavors had newly arrived and it tasted disgusting. Vaped it on Wednesday and it was tolerable but not so much an adv anymore. So... I'm late to go make a tie dye shirt. Damn. I wish I had done it. So anyway, I need to shower. I used the last coil I had (unless there are still a couple in the tank boxes) on the presumption that the new supply came. I love vaping with a new coil. The flavor is so good. I'm freezing. I'm not going to shower if they keep the AC on. It's so horribly cold. It's nice outside! I didn't need my winter coat. I wonder if it will be like the summer of '17. Cold and rainy. I wouldn't mind. I miss my friend. We're almost done going through the boxes in the storage space. When we finish, there will be t
he remaining boxes from the apartment. Hopefully there will still be room for everything I want to keep. I was too chicken to ride my bike last Saturday. Because the seat is too high and the water bottle holder is in my way. I want to ride my bike before there's some disaster to steal my bicycle riding away. It has been since 2008 I think that I last rode. I shouldn't have left Chicago. Things were really good there for awhile. Except for the psychosis which was horrible, I was happy there. I had all the benzos I could want and I weighed like 65 pounds less than now. I wish I could ride my bike to the bike shop, get the seat lowered, and the bottle holder removed, and ride on the lake bike path again. I'm really glad I get to see my friend pretty often. I wish vaping had gotten to this point by 2005. I'd have a lot more lung capacity now."

175958998,"A common symptom of mental illness is called Anosognosia. It is the ill person's inability to recognize the illness they are suffering from. You are not alone and it is one of the most frustrating aspects for a loved one or caregiver to experience. I cannot give you a solution to your question because I have the same circumstance with my 23yo son and it has not resolved itself yet. If you want to stay with your wife, you are going to have to learn how to deal with and react to her symptoms and hold your breath that she somedays recognizes the issue and is receptive to treatment. I strongly urge you to watch youtube videos by Dr. _NAME_ as he is the foremost expert on this topic."

175959000,"Hello to all who take a few minutes to read this . Since August of 2018 out of nowhere I developed what is called air hunger or should I say “dyspnea” and may I say it has to be the most uncomfortable sensation I’ve ever delt with . I’m 28 y/o 165lb and healthy . Iv had every test under the sun performed. PCP/Pulmonologist/ENT/cardiologist/GI/ Allergist , even a mental health doctor and not a single doctor has come up with a diagnosis except yea... I’m sure you’ve already guessed it “ANXIETY” witch for some reason I find is complete BS in my opinion. I had a blood taken and thyroid checked as well all normal . This sensation has been 24/7 since the day it came on last August not a single medication these doctors that I listed above have helped . Now to conclude that this may be anxiety... my PCP has me on Xanax witch is doing absolutely nothing for this sensation. all it does is makes me feel like not moving wonderful drug.... and In the past being this has been going on for 8 month
s I was put on many other benzo’s that also did nothing for this urge to take deep breaths . I was completely fine before this complete nonsense has come into my life and destroyed it. The only thing I had issues with was my temper witch kinda runs in my family. And stress from normal things in life witch I think every human being goes through. I have an amazing girlfriend of 10 years a great family, job I work hard at, and anything a young man could ask for . But now life is extremely uncomfortable and doing every day things is just horrid . I don’t know how I’ve even made it this far with this debilitating symptom. Nothing is making sense here and I’ve literally been praying for just an answer and a cure for this evil sensation. Now... I did use marijuana pens for about 8 months prior to this happening simply for pain from motocross accidents(broken bones) and like many others I enjoyed a calm and happy high hanging out at home or with friends listening to music and tinkering with our bikes . It wor
ked . Deff with pain and fatigued from being a mechanic witch is hard on your body . I will never touch a pain killer or get sucked into the opioid usage. The horror stories I’ve heard... so that being said I came to a complete stop with the Weed pen thinking this could have been the cause of this symptom. Well 3 months had passed and nothing got better so I kinda ruled that out but I figured I’d share that . It’s sad that I see others out here on these forums searching for answers from this literally silent but completely life altering symptom and we are getting no answers . All I ever hear is it’s all in your head ... but it’s a physical symptom and never goes away even with the treatment of these “head” medications that just make you feel like crap on top of feeling suffocated...? So as of this very moment I’m waiting for blood test back from the labs to see if Lyme or any infections related to Lyme may be the cause. but all my tries to curing this have gone down in flames . Just would like 
my life back . I have so much to live for so much to enjoy so many good people in my life . This has made me a miserable person and I’m so tired of it . So please if any one has anything new to mention or even an answer to this evil be my guest. We all need to get better ! Thank you for reading _NAME_ Post Edited (GarrettV91) : 5/7/2019 3:48:35 PM (GMT-6)"
175959001,"Helping those with mental illness can be rewarding. Making a difference in the lives of those trying to cope with this terrible illness not only helps them, it can also help you. Just knowing that you helped someone can be rather rewarding. However, helping others doesn't have to be rocket science. Granted, becoming a psychiatrist isn't easy. It's not a simple job. Being a psychiatrist and prescribing medication isn't a menial job by any means. But helping those with bipolar disorder, PTSD, depression, etc. doesn't necessarily require rocket science. Heck, just being a good listener when someone with mental illness is telling you about their problems isn't rocket science. However, it really can help people. Also, it doesn't have to rocket science in order for you to find it to be interesting and fascinating too. I've talked to those dealing with mental illness before. And while doing that wasn't brain surgery, I still found it to be both rewarding and interesting."

175959005,"40 million Americans face limitations in their usual life activities due to chronic illness. A chronic illness is an illness that lasts one year or more. 75% of all healthcare costs are due to chronic illness, and mental illness is one of the most expensive. The most common chronic diseases are heart disease, smoking-related conditions, alcohol-related conditions, diabetes, arthritis, cancer and mental illness. While direct healthcare costs soar, the total cost of chronic disease to the economy in 2007 was $1.3 trillion. Total economic cost includes lost productivity and the cost of disability and unemployment claims, in addition to medical costs. As the number of people with chronic illness increases, this total cost is expected to hit $4.2 trillion by 2023. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/older-bipolar/2019/09/the-numbers-on-chronic-illness/"
175959006,"Counties in the US with the worst air quality have a rate of bipolar disorder 27% higher than the national average. Prevalence of bipolar disorder was higher in the industrial east than on the west coast. Researchers surmise that pollution is the reason. A complicated set of factors goes into the expression of bipolar disorder, and much of the scientific focus has been on genetics. However, research published in August finds that environmental factors account for 32% of the risk of bipolar disorder. The study looked at insurance claims for bipolar disorder by county and compared the number of claims to EPA data on the environment. A significant relationship between poor air quality and high rates of bipolar disorder was established. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/older-bipolar/2019/10/air-pollution-and-bipolar-disorder/"

In your mom’s case she probably wants to see her grand-babies...and you’re doing so well an found a person of your own. There’s a transitional phase where you move from your primary family to a family of your own, the one you choose. You’re at that point now and it can be rough but it comes with freedom as well.

I think my parents are going to react super negatively to me wanting to switch pdocs.

175959011,"Years ago, I received treatment from a mental health agency. Everyday they would have a mental health worker employed by them come to the house that I was living in to help me cope with the depression and anxiety issues which I was facing at the time. They'd help me get through the day. They also had other clients that they worked with who also needed that kind of assistance. The mental health workers that I worked with back then told me that if you're a mental health worker, you learn something new each day. They couldn't tell me specifically what they learned each day while working with their other clients, as that was confidential information. However, I thought it was cool that they learned something about helping people with psychiatric issues like me each day. And I thought it was neat that they enjoyed learning new things about helping those with mental illness as well as learning about the illness itself each day. So if you're considering working in that field someday, realize that if you d

You find the reason by stopping to lie to yourself, by stopping to tell self that life is just too bad so I want to go, and by telling self ""I AM NOT GOING TO END IT.....I AM GOING TO MAKE IT !! Until that decision is made, and stuck to.....there will be no progress. But once that is determined.....MUCH PROGRESS WILL BE MADE. You have had a very hard life...no doubts about that, but only you can 
turn it around. Once you decide to stop this run-away-horse of yours, you will make progress, but until you do determine to live, we can do little to help. But once you change your mindset you will find the love and care that you need/want right here. Please tell me your reactions to what I have said."
175959062,"Yes, I feel like _PERSON_ summed it up quite nicely. I'd like to just add a bit of anecdote from my own experience. I'm an SPD male in a relationship with a BPD female, and though it's only been 3 years, it certainly has been the most fulfilling relationship I've ever had, intimate or otherwise. And while I still maintain an aloofness and indifference concerning interpersonal relationships with others, including my family, with her I feel a lot more ""normal"", or as _PERSON_ eloquently put it, ""temporarily human"". She makes me feel emotionally open and fulfilled in most of our interactions, though I still tend to shut down when she gets too emotional..(which always makes things worse but I can't help it.) It has been a roller coaster ride of an experience for sure, and we butt heads a lot, but I feel like that's what worthwhile relationships are all about; challenge and subsequent growth."

175959064,"No, what happened is that I sought a couple different second opinions. I ultimately decided to stay with the old psychiatrist through all that though. Just like a few weeks ago though he stopped responding to my calls. I would at least like some closure or information on whether I'm actually not his patient anymore. This is causing so much confusion for me."
175959065,I am horribly unmotivated for work. I guess maybe I'll just quit at this point. I am trying to start my own business anyway. I am motivated for most other things.
175959066,"Oh, sorry about that. I did the same with coricidin (sp?) when I was a teenager. Can't even go near it without needing to barf. I hope Robitussin will help. The best stuff is prescription codeine cough med. And lozenges help too."
174346873,"Ugh, I loathe the negative symptoms myself. Being lost inside yourself sums it up extremely well; as the reason I have become less and less ""crisis prone"" in the traditional sense is not because I am somehow more stable. No. I am more unstable than I have ever been. The difference is that I am less and less able to ""act out"", because I am more withdrawn by the day. I am very far removed from my external environment; I am only tenuously aware of matters as simple as the passage of time and my physical experiences at best and more often than not I lose awareness very quickly. My detachment and withdrawal from ""consensus reality"" is not a sign of stability, but just the opposite. I am spending more and more time detached from all of it ... and the inevitable result is deepening psychosis because said psychoses are more and more detached from ""consensus reality"" and thus it is far more difficult for me to have any insight about any of it. The few people left in my life worry about me, and know 
very well as they have known for years that if I am left alone for too long I will become completely unreachable ... and I will not notice that I have not moved in days or be able to do anything about it. I am only avoiding a long term care facility because I have enough outside support left. When all of that is gone, I am going to end up in a situation much like yours. I do not ever call anyone anymore. If they do not reach out to me then that is that. I do not know why I am like this, either. It is not out of a lack of love ... I just cannot anymore. It is as if something, a sort of invisible wall, is preventing such things ..."

175959074,If you're really concerned then get yourself analyzed. It won't help to make any assumptions and do something you could possibly regret. I recommend you look into a respectable person and see if they can help with the questions you have.
175959075,With my psychologist I was supposed to be focusing more on going to like restaurants and stuff and talking with people in the office and then COVID happened so it’s made it all worse. But sometimes now I just like to get out of the house and go for a drive. Don’t even have to stop anywhere. I got a lottery ticket at a store today while we were out and I was so nervous. Stupid anxiety.
175959076,That’s fantastic!
175959077,"Hi. You have a gift for writing. Have you ever contemplated writing a memoiristic account of this experience, this delusion, as you call it? And even post it on Medium or other blog? It might also work therapeutically, as so: you're worried about losing emotional touch with this mostly (but not wholly) satisfying interior relationship with this professor. Whether or not it was based on something real or perceived is less important than losing the feelings this connection engenders for you. At the same time, you've been told by doctors that you've had a psychotic episode, which is unsettling and probably not something you want to or should repeat, if at all possible. The answer to my mind is to write something memorable and true about the experience, trying hard to capture the essence of what transpired emotionally for you. Then you have it. It's not lost to you. And then you can seek the care and support you need to make your life fully present and ultimately fulfilling without delusions. Good luck
. You are talented and I'm sure you have a bright future."

And I said ""Yeah now I am I'm going for a walk around the block"" but wasn't really bored just mentally exhausted and needed to have a walk cuz I was craving cigarette. Then today they walked past me again and I looked at them but didn't wave and then they said ""Good morning"" in a tone of voice as if I was being rude so I said good morning... Then other people walked by and I said good morning.. I don't like her. That's why I didn't say good morning.. There's always problems everywhere I go with people..

I watched the news, went on reddit then put dextroamphetamine under my tongue and watched this for 2 hours; The Psychology of the Psychedelics | _NAME_ - _NAME_ Podcast - S4 E20 - YouTube One of the most interesting podcasts I've listened to. I feel like I don't care about anything - Bit of anhedonia. I keep thinking about what that person told me on the video chat - That I should stop my meds, I'll never get out of the psychiatric system, I don't make facial expressions, I'll end up as a serial killer, that my mom is a ***** and I should buy a dog - All in 10 minutes. I think about it every day. I took ibuprofen cuz of a headache - Possible keto flu. I've had no sugar today. I still rested my mind by lying down. My mom and sister were saying that I don't have weight to lose and that keto is bad. I told them about the benefits but they wouldn
't listen. Basically, the cells in my body WILL completely switch their fuel source from sugar to fat - Simple. What I'm looking forward to is more energy - Maybe sugar is the reason that I'm so tired all of the time.

175959100,"I have many issues happening in pretty much EVERY aspect of my life. Depression, Anxiety, CoParenting, Divorce, Parenting, Narcissistic Exhusband, bad relationships with family, Domestic Abuse, Dealing with Drug and Alcohol relationships, mistakes that i regret and own up too... I have always done everything by the book....Get married, go to college, have a career, start a family. I was married from 2001 to 2014 and we had been together for a total of 19 years ""high school sweathearts"" I did everything for my family and there were times I wanted to leave but never did becuase I beleive marriage is forever and tried so hard at it until I couldn't anymore. We have 3 kids they are now 16y/o boy, 14y/o girl and 10 y/o girl. My divorce was offical as of 10/2014. He was a ""functional alcoholic"" I had enough. When my son was 7 y/o he was also fed up and found his dad's alochol and dumped it down the drain and threw out the bottle. That broke my heart. He had a few DUI's. At the end of the marriage peo
ple and my family told me that he had been cheating on me for over 10 years, maybe I was blind to it or didn't believe it at the time. He did work out of town and out of state and there were days he would not come home and i would load my two babies up in the middle of the night to go searching for him and not find him. It was my decision for divorce. I was 32 years old when I divorced. My kids were 9, 7 and 4 at the time. I moved in with my sister. I went on an alcohol and sex binge for a few months, then I started a new relationship and got my own apartment then moved in with boyfriend...it was great at first and I didn't get out of it until he went to jail for drugs. I moved back in with my sister and again I went to alcohol and sex binges. then found another boyfriend, moved in with him and I married him (stupid, stupid). Then Summer of 2019 Me and Him took his 2 teen daughters and my 3 kids camping and long story short. My son and I had to call the cops cuz he was trying to kill my son and daughter and b
eat me and the rest of the kids in the middle of no where with no cell service. My sister had to come and pick me and the 5 kids up once we found someone to help us. I did not move back in with my sister I was able to keep the house I am still in...but again I went on an alcohol, sex and weed binge. I came home from lunch one time and I caught my daughter and her friends smoking weed in my garage. I sat them down and talked to them about it then a week later.... I made the mistake back in November 2019 of letting my oldest daughter and neice (14 years old) smoke weed one time at my house and I have regretted it ever since. I was in a super dark place and I got a relality check when my sister found out. I have had my shit together ever since. I have been in and out of counseling since 2014. My sister confronted my in december 2019 and I turned my life around 100%. My oldest daughter and I had a great relationship always. Then I started a new relationship the end of december 2019. My kids love him. My oldest da
ughter started sneaking out again and drinking. So my boyfriend put up cameras around our house and we knew everything that was going on. I am now in a relationship with a different type of man with no DV history or drug/alcohol addiction. I new the last 2 boyfriends were past addicts but I don't judge and seen at the time they had gotten their shit together... The man I am with now I have known since I was 14 years old. I lost my virginity to him then met my husband and never been with anyone else until end of 2014. My exhusband almost died in december from liver failure...alcohol use... then he got a new girlfriend and my daughter moved out telling me how much she hates me and I am not her mother.... fast forward to today. My daughter who moved out called me to pick her up from her dad's house last night cuz she doesn't get along with the girlfriend and the girlfriend tried to take her phone away so she could not contact me.... She told me she loves me and cried on my shoulder last night and there was lots 
of silents cuz I dont want to smother her. I want her to know and I have told her that she will always be welcome in my home and that I will ALWAYS be here for her."

For me, cutting provides a sense of relief and instant gratification. I am working on doing other things that fill that need, but sometimes they are still not enough. My advice is to try not to feel ashamed or guilty about it. Shame can just add more negative feelings. It happens and it doesn’t always have to be like this."
175959103,The switch version definitely doesn’t have as nice of graphics. I learned that the switch only has 720p graphics. Think of tv from the late 2000s or an old YouTube video. Weird I know.

Which it’s on sale on Xbox right now and you can probably get it even cheaper in disc form. Like 7 bucks I bet at a used store or something like GameStop. It’s an old game from like 2014 or 2016.

Unfortunately I don't think I have any suggestions to offer you. Perhaps there will be other PC members who will have thoughts they can share.

Talking your concerns through with a therapist or psychologist might help you to put your fears to rest.

175959139,"Appointment with doctor went well. He checked my blood pressure and it was fine (127/74). He said that I should only let him check my blood pressure and not check it myself anymore cuz that can make me anxious. He said 240 over something is high and those people have a condition but mainly high blood pressure (Like 150/100) is still fine as long as it's not for a long period of time. I told him about the phenibut and said I got it down to 400mg from 1500-2000mg and he said that's good. I shouldn't use it all the time cuz everyone has bad days and he wants me to go skiing, hiking, etc and just enjoy life and stop searching things on the internet all the time. I told him about alprazolam (Xanax) and he said taking it once a month is ok but not all the time. I told him I treated my depression with low doses of ketamine for 4 months and it worked. He said that it can be prescribed here but I said that I don't want it prescribed because I'd rather BE my thoughts than to LOOK AT them. I don't have severe 
depression anyways and don't need it anymore. I think he was trying to make me feel less anxious and secure before I go to see my mom for her last week of radiation. So far so good."

In October I got sick of feeling bloated and did some research and ask my doctor to do a hydrogen breath test to see if I had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. My test was positive so I did three rounds of xifaxan antibiotic. I requested a follow-up test to see if it was gone about a month ago and it was. I still have the same symptoms though - I get full fast, I feel bloated and I'm constipated a lot. So I had a well woman exam yesterday and when she was doing the second part of the exam, it was kind of painful on one side and she said she felt a fullness but it could be my colon too. I asked her how different types of female cancers are diagnosed since they have the same gastro symptoms as a lot of other things. So she put in an order for an ultrasound. I don't really want to do it because my insurance sucks and I have to pay for it until my deductible is met which is $750. Ugh Now I'm nervous about it. U

175959179,"Yes. We're lucky in our unluckiness. Having to prioritize 'gripping the armrests' can help to keep us from getting sucked into the bs. For several decades, media conglomerates have invested billions of dollars in fabricating lies which are as unresolvable as impossible objects ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object ). These, along with bright, shining celebrity irrelevancies, are designed to keep the masses distracted, angry, and divided. Real information of vital everyday concern, such as net neutrality and the enduring availability of clean drinking water, exists but one must actively seek it, evaluate it, and verify it. Many people are lazy, still more are tired, so tired that their creative energy has, in some cases, degenerated into mindless chatter about laundry days. They are too tired to remember to make time to look at their lives. If it's any consolation, I don't believe anyone involved in the 'laundry days' thread(s) would be proud of how they used their time. One of the thing
s I most deeply loathe is when, on a forum, someone shares something off-beat, and the 'forum elite' (what bs!) jump all over that person simply for having a different opinion. Sincerely held opinions which differ from the majority are vital to the health of any community. Oblivion, I'm sorry you got banned from the other forum but, on the up side, it's one less source of stress. If the discussions weren't any good, maybe keep looking for a more interesting group."
175959180,"I'll share what happened at my job last year in a different post to keep these things short, but I do need to share the fact that I'm on long term disability right now for anxiety/PTSD. This last year has been a nightmare, issues with my job and lack of adequate medical care led me to end up on long term disability. Along with that, I lost my house (sale fell through), then had to file for bankruptcy. I ended up with a very bad attorney, and lost my home, lost my rental, lost both of my vehicles, and went for an entire month without pay because my bank was taking all of my direct deposits, which then resulted in me getting my electricity and cell phones disconnected. I ended up doing all of my paperwork myself, and then paid an attorney to help me file it and go to the hearing with me. I lost $5000, along with everything else. In February, a month before I was going to end up on long term disability, I tried to get my ex to take care of our kids (he never does) so I could go out of town for medical 
care. He lives 85 north of us, in a different state, but he works in the town that we live in. He just didn't feel it was his responsibility to help me. So, once my bankruptcy was discharged, I sent him the official letter, telling him I wanted to move to AZ, which is where my oldest son and step-daughter lived. I wanted to move out there primarily for our daughter, who is extremely gifted in both music and art, and they had a school out there that I hoped she'd be able to attend. I didn't think my ex would have any issues with this, he didn't bother much with our kids, and he knew I was doing this for our daughter. He didn't, but his mother did, she's got an unhealthy attachment to our seven year old son. He told me that he agreed to let us relocate so I began to plan the move out there. Two weeks before we were supposed to move, I was served. He was not only objecting to the move, he was also asking the courts to give him sole custody. Why? He alleged that I had a severe mental illness (didn't have to say w
hich one), and that I took drugs (which drugs?), and that I was planning to take off with our kids (that's why he told me he agreed, to get me to start making plans to move out there). Included in that objection was a restraining order that prevented me from taking our kids out of the county. I, fortunately, had just taken money out of my 401k, or I'd have been unable to hire an attorney. I hired one, didn't meet her until the first hearing, which was to see if the judge would allow us to go out to AZ temporarily. She should have known better, this judge doesn't allow temporary relocations of children, but that was minor in comparison to my attorney telling the judge, as soon as she called on her, that she wasn't prepared for the hearing. It didn't go well, and the judge denied my request to relocate. While we waited for the judge to make a decision, we remained restricted to the county, and then I started getting the subpoenas that his attorney was issuing, along with a HIPAA waiver, so they could get approv
al to access my medical records. I was horrified, I felt so violated by this, you'd think there'd have to be some basis for this, other than an allegation. It seemed as though they were just going to let him keep fishing through my records until he found something he thought he could use to get custody. I hired another attorney, I had to pay him $8000 up front before he'd start working on my case, but he never did anything other than send emails to me and my ex's attorney. It'd been almost two months, I was still under the restrainer order, I had hoped to at least go visit my sister before my kids went back to school, but my ex's attorney wouldn't agree to let us go. By now my discovery documents were almost a month overdue, this attorney still hadn't even filed a notice of appearance, much less done anything productive with my case, so, on to attorney number three, and another $7500. She was, by far, the cruelest person i've dealt with in a very long time. I was optimistic that she'd help us (I'm a fool), bu 
four days after I paid her, she started telling me that she thought I woudl end up losing my children This was based on what my doctor had put in my file in June 2019, that said I was withdrawing from my children. I don't know why she felt it was necessary to tell me that when she had no strategy or game plan to follow it up with. I have PTSD, but I imagine any parent who was told something l9ike that would panic. I spent the weekend torturing myself as I went through all of the emails from back when we were still married (2014 - 2015). I didn't know if that would help, but I figured it might help demonstrate where my anxiety issues started. I didn't send them to her though, I just sent a quick email asking if she thought they'd help. For that, she spent three hours chastising me about trying to play the victim. This happened two more times, and her accusations just kept getting worse, and she continued to tell me I was going to lose my children. I didn't feel I had a choice but to let this woman do this to m
e, I knew I wasn't going to find another attorney, I had trouble finding her! I asked her earlier this week if she'd be willing to just speak to my brother, I knew she'd be less likely to do that to him than she had been to me. For that, she told me she was going to withdraw from my case, and now I'm probably going to have to go up against a very nasty father's rights lawyer. I've lost $35,000 since June, $25,000 of it was through these attorney's. I don't feel like anyone cares about me or my kids, my ex hasn't been impacted at all by this, since his legal fees are covered by his mother. I feel like I'm being held hostage. I can leave, but I'd have to give up my kids. This is also why I can't get new medical care, not when he can subpoena my records. I'm holding it together, but I'm all alone here, if nothing else it'd be nice to have people that i could talk to that understand what I'm going through. Hopefully someone out there knows someone who might be able to help me."

(net says is a series of x-rays) I had chest pains for years, also, and as soon as my difficult marriage was over, so was my chest pain. As you said, your doctor said that your chest pain was from anxiety. But then you stood up to that analysis by saying, ""Oh, but I have high cholesterol."" Trust me on this one, it's the anxiety.

When I was 14-15 BPD symptoms was the main issue. From 16-now it was just the crippling depression. Last year I had a 5 month long involuntary admission at 17, as a last resort they told me ECT may benefit me. It did save my life. However I only remained well for about 2 months and had to be admitted again for a few months. Once I was back to myself (kinda) they recommended I have maintenance ECT. I still have maintenance ECT.

I get these ""visions"" where I remember in detail something happening and I know for sure it happened. But sometimes the visions didn't actually happen yet. I just think I did. So when I kept getting these ""_NAME_"" feelings (that aren't actually _NAME_ because I know it happened already), I realized that I can sometimes predict the future? At first I really thought I had psychic powers. Not in a delusional way, I just have a very open mind, and explore all possibilities. I still think it could be possible but this ability is really messing with my life I have to keep asking myself if something really happened or not, because my brain thinks it does, but then someone else will tell me something that gives me evidence that it did
n't.... And then I get really confused and I don't know what is even happening. Or I was with my friend and we went on a walk and I told her we have been there before because I remembered in full detail what we did, what we talked about, etc. But my friend kept saying we have never been here, ever. I thought maybe SHE forgot. Every time I'm going about my day, I keep getting information sent to my mind, and I don't know from where. Like if I'm doing something, (for example if i were to have some stain on a shirt) my brain would literally tell me ""Did you know that *blank* will get rid of that stain with no problem!"" I know it sounds like maybe i'm having ""THOUGHTS"" but they aren't thoughts. These NEW pieces of information just pop into my mind and after I thank the message, I have to keep asking myself ""Where the hell did the information come from"". I've noticed that I automatically have kept saying ""I read somewhere that..."" to myself or others when information comes in and then I realized how many t
imes a day I kept telling myself or others that same thing and then I realized, I didn't actually read it somewhere. It just came in. I don't even understand what's happening with that and I keep forgetting so many things. When the ""_NAME_"" thing happens, since I know it's happened before FOR SURE but can't explain it or have proof, I have to keep rationalizing it to make it work.. I don't know why but I just do. And so basically when it happens I tell myself ""oh i must have seen this before but just forgot"". ""oh i must have read it somewhere but just forgot"" ""oh i did this or that and just forgot"" I don't know but everything is so confusing and I keep asking myself what the actual **** is happening and i've noticed i'm more suspicious of others and even people close to me and I just keep asking myself ""why the heck did i just think my family would do that"" I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore I'm already confused but I'm worried about myself but I really don't know. So there are only 3 
possibilities: - I really do have psychic powers but I can't control them which is why it is messing up my life with everything and it keeps ruining everything and won't let me think properly. - I have a brain tumour which is why my brain is not working properly and making me feel off and have all these problems - I am losing my sanity Please let me know which of the 3 are more likely, thanks. Because i really don't know. So"
175959213,"I feel I dissociate a lot. I been diagnosed with depression, major depression disorder, anxiety and mood disorder, panic attacks even ADHD and insomnia. I had one doctor who tried to treat me with medication that worked better for bipolar disorder. I can't remember the first medication but after 3 days I had to stop taking it. They wrote another medication for lithium, I refused to fill it after looking it up and stop going to that doctor. The first medication messed with my mind really bad. I lost complete trust in that doctor after two visits and nearly losing my mind even more. He never even mentioned changing my diagnosis and treating me for bipolar disorder. Took me a awhile before I saw another doctor. My last doctor was treating me for major depressive order and anxiety. I feel like my diagnosis is off. I never heard of dissociation until early this year, also I have learned about complex PTSD. I haven't talked to my doctor as I don't want to tell them maybe it could be those diagnosis, so i
n the mean time I refuse to take anymore medications. I am meeting with my therapist this Friday, but I have missed my last 2 or 3 appointments due to not wanting to get out of bed or be around anyone. I hope I make this one."

175959216,I'm feeling pretty good today. Lowered the dose of phenibut to 850mg. Didn't take any benzo to sleep again. The 7.5mg olanzepine and 50mg Seroquel helped. But I notice that my mind and body isn't really connected to actions. I believe everyone else is like that as well. I have less awareness right now. I'm just going on autopilot because it's more comfortable that way. I'm just watching life as a spectator. It's less painful that way. I think I might be slightly dissociated. It's probably a side effect of the ketamine last year. It changed my brain to make me less depressed. I don't feel that depressed right now.

175959225,"Hi _PERSON_ and welcome back! I am sorry that things have been difficult for you...but am so glad to see you reaching out and taking steps to get back on track! Well done! I saw in the weekly thread that you are back on a daily Rx and Vistaril for panic as needed. This sounds like a solid plan, and one that will hopefully be just what you need in order to manage things well. Once you have leveled out I hope that you can have a re-evaluation with your P-doc to get an accurate dx now that you are sober. I think this is important for accuracy, and to know how to continue treatment. Keep us updated, we are always here to encourage and support! S.C."
175959226,"Hi _NAME_, I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing this new and disturbing symptom. I have been through it myself and it is really a challenging one....since as you said, turns into a vicious cycle of anxiety=symptom=more worries=increased symptoms! Breathing Exercises really were my relief when it came to the feeling of breathlessness. In all honesty, it can be tough when first learning the discipline of using breathing techniques, but well worth the perseverance and continued practice! (even if at first it makes you more focused and aware of the issue) One exercise in particular helped me. It is called 'The Divided Breath'. It gives structure and brings a sense of control over your breathing once again by visualization and counting/timing. (if you are interested let me know and I will do a search and copy and paste instructions here for you) You can also look up the suggested breathing exercises in our Resources at the top of the main forum page. They should all be helpful to you. Getting to 
work on breathing techniques as well as continuing your regular coping skills should give you the relief you need. Peace and progress, S.C."

Or what he calls drug induced mania. I on the other hand am scared of the notion of doing away with ssri altogether. My doc said, its either lithium 300mg with an ssri or no ssri at all.

From my understanding people can freak the **** the out and be unpredictable and violent. IMO if he’s actually using while he’s in the presence of the kids...he should be reported. I do not believe the kids are safe if he’s using. May sound *****y but I watched my nephews and nieces go through hell w/addict parents. I should have taken them and reported their asses. I should have advocated for the kids but I always thought it wasn’t *that* bad and I could and did rescue them as needed. Now that I’m an adult I hate myself for NOT having done that.

175959258,"The thing about SPD is...it isn't usually a sudden thing. I am mystified sometimes by the stories that I read about from people who are in relationships with those they suspect of having SPD. Like, personally, even as a fairly secret schizoid, it becomes really, really hard to mask my complete emotional unavailability and lack of attachment after a short time. How do these relationships even happen? It blows my mind. I have to say, that if it's a sudden change, you might want to be looking into depression as a back up. Depression and SPD can have similar symptoms. For example, sleeping a lot is more of a descriptive sign of depression than it is SPD. Low energy, could arguably be both. Lack of interest in sex could be both. Lack of interest in normal activities could be both. Depression can be sudden onset. Schizoid personality disorder isn't usually. I do see that there were apparently signs of SPD before, like a lack of relationships or initiative. I scratch my head a little at why anyone would w
ant to enter a relationship with someone like that, but to be fair I have SPD, so in general I question why people choose to have relationships at all. I hope things work out for you. I don't think it's healthy that ""he's working to meet your expectations"". That doesn't sound like a healthy relationship for either of you. Seems like a power imbalance to me."
175959259,"Yes!!! Am autistic addict.. Very easy to stick with habits, hard to break out of them - Very hard to change (Initiate new task..). You have to do it in a split second - It requires practice which makes the brain neuroplastic and easier to learn, adapt and change. It gets easier with time - Like playing a game - Then you want a challenge even more and realize that you're miles ahead of anything you've ever dreamed of. It's a reason as to why _NAME_ wrote in mirror text or used his left hand. _NAME_ started out with a learning disability and now he's a world famous cognitive trainer. He says to use your left hand when brushing your teeth and morning routines etc - Says to learn as if you're going to teach someone else the same thing.. Stuff like that. I think it's a reason as to why people with dyslexia become so creative (They have to think outside of normal reality/language). I've been learning these things - My room is spotless.. Everything is always in the same place (But that can become a hinder
ance as well so it's good to change things up - I think that's why people end up wanting change anyways because it's a natural brain muscle reaction to help us survive..

It's actually something I have been in trouble for many times as a teenager. These last couple of years tho, have been really heard, and made my anxiety out of control The only thing I can help with is feeling that the attack is coming. And you know the worst thing about it? I KNOW I am doing it to myself and I just can't seem to make it just go away! I know that I just need to relax my brain, I know I just need to breath, I know it's all just in my head, and still it never ends. It consumes me. Everything.

I've been hallucination and delusion free for over 4 years and that would not have been possible without those hospitalizations which gave a safe environment for us to find the right combination of meds for me. I have a really amazing life now and most of my experiences inside were okay. Most people are nice in there (the patients and nurses). Different ones focus on different things. Some have a lot of group and individual therapy while other's it's more free time. They usually have outside or recreation times and art or music therapy every week. There was chapel available on Sundays. I don't smoke but I kept a separate sweatshirt I would use to go out on smoke breaks so I could get outside a little. Some places have delicious food and some have pretty yucky stuff, but it's tolerable. There are usually snacks available throughout the day since so many people need to take meds with food at different times. It was hard being 
mostly cut off from people (although there were weekly visiting times). I came away with some crazy stories. I even miss it occasionally because although my life is really good now, there is something nice about not being responsible for things, just following a routine and going where asked.

Other people didn't look at me differently (even though sometimes it felt like I should have been wearing a sign that said ""Hey I'm Schizophrenic"".

We will see how it goes. My doctor called me yesterday telling me to just stick to one thing for a while med-wise. Well, it's hard when I don't feel well. Anyway, I feel fine now.

I didn't know this, but I've been method writing, taking on the character, the devil, of my book, and reacting, and seeing, and that tweet was him, not me. I need to overhaul that story with a feminists perspective to do that female professor justice if this story is serious and that character sincere. I might have to send it to my editor a 2nd time after I give that character a fair shake."

I'm gonna force myself to go. It's not that I don't want to, I was looking forward to it I'm just depressed. But I know it will be good for me to do. This weekend I'm sleeping over at my sisters and we're gonna make some Italian bread using her bread machine, watch movies, talk/hangout, she's probably gonna make some homemade meatballs and spaghetti to go with the bread."

175959322,"Thanks BB and SP, I will talk to my pdoc about it and therapist, and weight everything. I'll talk with my family about it as well. Yeah I think my mom takes in about $800 a month, and she works part time as well. That would be a very tough budget, given apartments cost easily that much a month, then i'd have to make enough for utilities and what not. I don't see how that would be possible. I wish I had a social worker, I hear this city is awful when it comes to social services, because _PERSON_ cut so much of the resources needed for it."
175959323,I seriously am SO EXCITED to get out of here. Like beyond thrilled. I just hope it's not too bad of a neighborhood.

175959332,Morning. Finally got a good sleep last night. I swept and mopped the floor then do some skin care regime to my face (been neglecting this due to stress) and used some melons scented body scrub and now I smell like melons ?
175959333,"I'm feeling better now. Just needed to wind down. I noticed that while I was falling asleep this morning after a bit more phenibut without tolerance (Still less than I used to take), I had a bad heart palpitation but I ignored it and went to sleep. I had very vivid dreams. One particular dream was about my brother tormenting me but more pronounced in my dreams so I woke up making noises and then my mom asked me if I was ok (She was in the other bed in the same room). As the Vyvanse was kicking in this morning and I went back to sleep, I had sleep paralysis and tried to get out of it so I rolled off my bed (But this was all in my head) and then I was transported back to my bed again (Back into my real body) and tried to wake up by moving my eyes up - But every time I moved my eyes up, I'd have an absence seizure (Like I had all the time when I was a baby). This stuff is very annoying and I want it to end. Someone on the DID forum said that my depersonalization seemed like psychosis because I don't h
ave an alter but I've never experienced that type of thing while in psychosis. Psychosis is pretty chill compared to that because to me, it's about being paranoid and mistrustful, delusional so it's not really a scary thing when I look back on it. But depersonalization is. I just don't really care about labels I just know the dissociation is from the psychedelics and I want it to go away. My doctor said to stop researching things on the internet and don't worry about it. He said that I shouldn't try to find the reason as to why I was having panic attacks or why they went away so I didn't. But now they are seeming to come back so Idk. I didn't take enough benzos to be addicted yet either. Or have seizures for that matter. It's actually gotten to the point where I'm horribly confused about what is happening to me and how to explain it to doctors."
175959334,"Used to do this routinely and recreationally , 100% of the time, until my Sicilian/Calabrese New Yawker friend, _NAME_, told me, ""(_PERSON_), you turn, and when you turn against me, it's gonna hurt."". Well, this wonderful, self-destructive, insanely creative smoker friend, _NAME_, is one of only a handful of people I've ever truly loved. To the core. When he dies (I'm convinced he's trying to slowly kill himself, married as he is to a supah-ambitious, social-climbin' HR representative (you heard that right) who used to prep canvases for _NAME_), a crazy light will go out in the world. One of the finest lights ever. I will have a much harder time denying the dead weight. A Russian guy I met pushed me away a year or two ago, and the comeuppance actually felt good . He seemed shocked at how well I took things. Either you understand the depth or you don't."

175959351,i see sz as more cloud control than mind control. sz is like trying to establish and maintain an ongoing identity within the collective cloud control possession. sz is like a cloud recall perception jockey cracking the whip with each bit of channeling on it's journey. it could help to not just be a fair weather friend with the omni conversation and to condition threshold tolerance to be used to being zero'd without accepting stockholming as a default and to have cloud art flow as a stock guideline.

They have series of meditations for different problems. Like 10 for anxiety, 10 for productivity, 10 for motivation, communication skills, sleep, gratitude, just tons and tons of meditations. I've been using it since March. They gave a free 1 year trial in March to help people with stress due to the covid pandemic starting. My trial runs out this coming March but I definitely plan on paying for another year, I feel it's worth it"
174347236,Thanks for the breakdown of your history. Very interesting. Hope that you have a good 2020.
175959358,"Vraylar is working very well for me. But I'm kinda worried about psychosis appearing in the future because I tend to grow tolerant to these drugs. So they work for months and then I relapse despite the medicine and have to switch to a new drug. That's what happened with Geodon Panic attacks are good! I still have anxiety (particularly obsessive anxiety) but I'm able to calm it before it reaches panic attack level. Unable to tell if the Klonopin is working or not, but I assume it is."

Take care."
175959365,"In theory it sounds great, but in reality it wouldn't work. As a child, _NAME_ would be uncontrollable. The lack of impulse control alone wouldn't allow him to follow his dad's advice, even if he wanted to. Generally though, I think there's value in the approach. Working with someone's mindset instead of changing it seems like a no-brainer to me, but suggesting that there's an avenue to killing which is ok, would be lunacy. I burned a garage down as a child because my father suggested, as an off-hand comment to my mother which I overheard, that it would be safer if it wasn't there. There are no limits, nothing stopping an escalation."

175959369,"Hello I'm 67 yrs old, but due to health issues, it feels like 97 on most days. Like a lot of people, I stay in more than I used to. It bothered me at first bc when I have a good day, I want to get out and do something. But life is different now, so I have found other things to do that don't involve being around crowds. I remind myself that many people have it much worse. Younger people have to go to work, not knowing if the work place is taking the proper safety precautions. And so many jobs are being lost now. I pray a lot for young people now, bc they are facing so many problems that we never had to deal with. As for myself, retirement has been a big adjustment. I didn't like it at first, bc I was used to being busy and having a schedule. But I've come to realize there is a lot to be said for having no schedule. I can do what I want when I feel like it. I can read books I never had time for, watch TV all day if I feel like it, and spend time just for myself. After having worked all my life, this 
is not so bad. It can be lonely at times, and I admit that's very difficult. I've been a widow for a while now. So it's important to make connections with other people. It's a little harder now with this pandemic, but you can find a way. And you need something to be interested in. I've always loved animals, and I have 2 dogs that wouldn't have homes if I had not taken them in. Now they get lots of love and they give me a reason to get up in the morning. You can make a life for yourself if you put some effort into it. It's worth it not just for you, but for your grandson as well. You will have good days and bad days, but we all do."
175959370,"My yes OceanFisher, It caused me diabetes when I was young and I think it contributed to my fibromyalgia. Well, I am not sure if it is anxiety or stress. I think stress causes anxiety. But with the fibromyalgia my shoulders hurt, when I get anxious I get tense and before I know it my shoulders are up by my ears. I carry a lot of anxiety and tension in my shoulders. Relaxing them helps. I have too had it cause stomach problems for me. And I think it causes slower reactions to me. I could be wrong. But when I am anxious I am not focusing on what I am doing. I hope your surgery goes well. Keep us posted on how it goes. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175959373,"Mtn_craving No, it is not weird or wrong to wish we could go back and do it over again! Only problem is.....there are no re-dos in life! However....that time away back then is NEVER LOST...EVER! The reason is because you have learned some things from the experiences you had back then. So, you take those hard-learned lessons, and you move forward, a smarter man than before. Why not get really brave, and tell us what you learned, and how difficult it was. We are here to help if we can, and to maybe make the future a little brighter for you."

175959382,Theres a little farm next to the work smoke area. I always see donkeys and cows out in the field. This guy came up and looked at me while I vaped.
174347258,My online therapist didn't respond today. I don't know what her schedule is like or anything. It's the weekend now. I'm concerned I may not get a response until late Monday. By then it will be too late. I was dealing with a lot of anxiety today. It would have been nice to get some support. I just have to lower my expectations and accept that I have no support. I don't want to take on a victim role. There are things I can do. I can find another therapist. But I will give this until mid next week to decide. But I really must let everything go. I'm tired of being disappointed every single day.
175959383,"I just texted him, I’m gonna go hang out with him Monday"
175959384,I’ve had anxiety my whole life but never like this. Had to deal with a trigger and it threw me into the deep end. I had major panic attacks for days followed by periods of what felt like nothingness. I’d stare into space unable to connect with my family or even my dog. I started BusPar (anti anxiety medication) only to have this feeling intensified. No panic attacks but I feel like there’s a bucket over my head. When I walk around it’s like I’m seeing the world through a carnival mirror. I can enjoy myself for short periods of time but I still feel “drunk”. I don’t even want to spend time with my fiancé and have been pushing him away all month. I’m feeling absolutely hopeless and am terrified about how I feel. Any support is appreciated. Thanks for reading part of my story.

175959389,"I think it might help me on a prn basis and I’m going to try it. If I heard my doc correctly, I believe she said I can use it that way. She told me this after she’d rx’d It for me for sustained use and I couldn’t tolerate it. Here’s what happened: I started with 5mg. 2x/day. The first few days (2-4 days) I felt good, more energetic and motivated. I accomplished some things I’d been putting off. Then....insomnia started and got worse. During my waking hours, I was starting to feel driven and almost compulsive. After about 9-10 days, I knew I couldn’t sustain such usage and began tapering it down and off within a week. So much for needing a built-up blood level. So what I’m thinking could work is just using it 1-2 days when I’m feeling anxious or worried, probably 5mg per dose. It was at that dose previously that I felt good. This is my working theory at this point. I know that’s a low dose, but I’m 74 yrs old and may do best on a low dose. Will let you know how it goes.

175959392,"Hi _PERSON_, I completely understand how your feeling. I always get super anxious before a drs appointment. Like you, I’m a young (32yo) female with no serious conditions and not exercising as much with COVID. I know deep down that it will likely be just fine and they won’t find anything wrong; it’s always the what if thinking that’s gets me. I recently had my annual and they ended up calling me to do it virtually over the phone. I was worried about it at first but it went really well! I didn’t have to go in the office with COVID close by and I didn’t have to get my blood pressure/pulse up worrying knowing it would be checked ????? My advice would be to keep it and see if they offer virtual visits. If your really uncomfortable with the possibility of COVID ask to reschedule. I just had a bunch of blood work done yesterday from my annual and I’ve been super anxious since yesterday worrying what they might find. Anxiety sucks. We all feel your pain.

175959395,"In one sense, it sounds to me like you already know the answer to your own question, which is the same as my answer to my own ""overwhelming question"", namely, to avoid the ego-syntonic ""playing to our strengths"" and to opt instead to try to annihilate our deep internal fears. In another sense, there is a question which I was bred to ignore, namely, ""Can I truly enjoy myself?"". Are you really enjoying yourself coding? Are you really in a state of ""flow""? Or has it (secretly, deep-down) come to bore you? Are there coding risks and adventures which you have not yet explored? Do you really want to fight your inner demons, or do you just not know how to relax and have fun? I suspect that many people truly do not know how to do the latter. Having enough saved to be able to give the finger to the world would certainly help in this situation. You've got a real-life family and can't go too far off-road financially, so I hope your startup idea has real and not delusional merit. Sorry to be blunt here 
but, when one is alone in one's head it's too easy to lose perspective, by both exaggerating and trivializing one's abilities. There must certainly be many venture-capital people who've come from software development positions who would be able to perceive your merit and who would appreciate a ""sales pitch"" devoid of smoke and mirrors. Regardless of what you do, one day you will be dead."

175959402,"Hey guys. Need to vent about a few things. First about my discord server. So me and my friends made a discord server. I was working hard to make that place a warm and peaceful community. But my friends started adding problematic people in and my friends started arguing with each other a lot too. Long story short, I left because I was tired seeing arguments all the time. It was a good decision but it still hurts to see my hard work for over a year going to waste just like that. Second is about my painting. I joined a few painting communities, on Facebook and on Discord. There are just so many talented artists out there. I lose my confidence anytime I see their paintings. I logically know that art is unique to everyone and that comparison is a bad habit, but I can’t overcome this incompetence feeling anyway. Third one is about a situation in my house.

t she’s been acting up because of this. Before pandemic she used take an afternoon walk to go to the grocery nearby. Now that she can’t do that anymore she let out her frustration by yelling at us. It’s just so tiring taking care of her. She’s my grandma of course I love her so much, but getting yelled at in a daily basis takes a toll on my mental health. Add the sweet _NAME_ on top to these situations is the long and tiring visa process. I feel like crying but crying won’t solve anything so I don’t."
174347280,"I would suspect many people with schizophrenia may not be completely interested, or even unable to adhere to serious topics. Idk, I really dont. That's a large guess, which I think is incorrect. But I can tell you, most of the regulars here post on Roll Call. There are very close, respected, and long-time regulars here. Schizophrenia forum doesnt get a lot of random people popping up and starting threads. So the regulars have kind of built their own community within this forum to keep up with each other on a daily basis. Also, the non-serious threads you are talking about; movies, video games, ""did you shower?"", etc, it's a way for us with schizophrenia/schizoaffective to be able to have routine in our lives, and keep busy, or just keep their routine in check, in order to maintain the most stable life possible for us."

175959419,Hi everyone. I decided to write weed thoughts and put it in a trigger so you can read it if you want to. This is basically what weed does to me. But is that psychosis? I don't think so.. but maybe.. Possible trigger: I wonder how many neurotransmitter connections it takes in the brain to create a thought? Because some peoples brains can be damaged and they can still think.. so certain parts of a brain create consciousness.. but I'm talking about one thought.. That means spontaneous consciousness has to form in order to create reality.. a universe is another persons reality.. so to create another universe in a lab is to create brain tissue.. and then what is a black hole? Where the hell is inside infinite mass spinning at infinite speed? A brain? It could be anything which is god which created the big bang and even the big bang was god.

It's as if he thinks I have control over my ptsd, I am aware of it, I communicate it... How can I help him understand that it isn't blame. It is real emotionally I slip into survival mode, if it's a trigger or damaging, and I need him to understand. I do not want to keep allowing my illness to take over... Open to any suggestions."

175959441,"I've always tinkered with my meds, I'm still doing it, I will always do it. I understand you. But you have to know how to do it very slowly, and with a doctor's supervision. I know I'm crazy, I will always be crazy. My first psychosis drove me to suicide and ruined my future and how people see me. I will be on meds my entire life. When I first looked at my mountain o meds I had to take, I looked at them as if ""This is what my life has amounted to."" But that's the wrong way to look at it, I now look at it like, ""This pill is life, this pill that I take once or twice fixes me."" My med changes are simple, I decrease very slowly over months, until I start to feel differences, like psychotic feelings, or insomnia. Then I have to go back up, but it takes a very long time to do that. It's very much the long game. I once dropped a med willy-nilly and it destroyed my life--for good. Because I went off of Wellbutrin all of a sudden, all at once, because I felt it wasn't doing anything, I went off and it 
gave me multiple panic attacks a day for 5 years. TO stop the panic attacks I got on a mood stabilizer, and that gave me bipolar symptoms of rapid cycling. I wanted an ice pick to do through my eye it was so bad. Then I was forced to go on an SSRI and that's the story of my life, because I went off a med willy nilly I suffered panic attacks, which led to anhedonia, which then lead to bipolar rapid cycling, and that sent me on a _USER_ID_ for years. You've got to do it slowly, safely, and under supervision. Example: I had my Geodon at 80mgs for years. I got off moodstabilizers because I didn't think I needed them anymore. So I got off of my mood stabilizer, and I didn't have panic attacks anymore, nor did I rapid cycle. My doc said okay, lets up the Geodon to 160 for the insomnia. That didn't do it. But I added Trileptal. And that releaved my insomnia (hypomania in the back ground). So now that I have my insomnia undercontrol I can slowly go down to 120mgs on my geodon, which is a good dose, and all is well. b
e safe. It takes a long time to do it the right way."
175959442,Hello everyone. Im back one year later. Things aren't any better unfortunately. Since last year ive been going even more crazy with getting tests done to rule out what's been going on with me. All of my tests have came back normal yet again. I am now forced to accept the idea that I am feeling the way I am feeling physically due to my anxiety which is a really hard thing for me to accept. That being said I have been told time and time again by my therapist that I should get on a medicine to help me out and help me feel better. I am still extremely hesitant to take medicine and I have my doubts about it in general. I'm stuck yet again unfortunately. If anyone could give me any advice it would be much appreciated. Thank you and it's good to be back.
175959443,I put my bra on and my back is not in much pain virtually at all now.

You don't have to socialize with the whole group, just look for a person that seems nice and strike up a conversation. It's not as hard as you think.

It's just telling that one of the few places on this international, anonymous internet where I find insightful, real communication about the nature of existence happens to be a forum for a type of mental illness that forces its sufferers to address 'reality', 'society', and 'life' in ways most humans spend their entire lives actively avoiding. As though the natural bent of the human mind were to obsess over lowest-priority concerns until the last unavoidable moment. In life, I believe we all reach that point. A few will have prepared for years, having had no other choice. Most, however, will be clocked unawares and for them, it will not be pretty. * * * Ultimately, creativity and the process of abstraction is about the removal of the unnecessary, revealing the speaking core of a thing. Similarly, the journey of life is about getting rid, getting it out there. This discussion has helped me to realize that life is not only about shedding p
ossessions and hangups, but about shedding ideas and plans which we have hoarded for some nebulous future date which never comes , in order to be completely, radiantly 'empty' at the end. And the only legitimate way to shed creative ideas and plans is to execute them , earnestly, without premature judgment. To Hell with those who accuse us of causing them 'secondhand embarrassment'.

But you're doing the right thing trying to find ways to be present and moving on with your life even during these circumstances. Is there any way to do safe socially-distanced activities at your place? As someone else mentioned, just music or singing can be enjoyed with people at a safe distance. Is a community garden or book club, cooking classes or anything like that available where you are? Or maybe people would be interested in starting those. People can read the book and meet on Zoom or in a socially-distanced large area and discuss the book. Might be quirky but still fun. Same with cooking where one can demonstrate a meal and others can watch from Zoom or a distance. It might take creativity, but that's half the fun. And when in your quiet personal time, please remember Proverbs 16:31 Gray hair is a crown of beauty (or 
glory) When it is found in the way of righteousness. Remember how loved and valued you are by your Creator and are never truly alone.

175959494,"Labelle: I've been there in that to go somewhere or not to go somewhere situation. As a bipolar, I was not on the right medicine, I was on an anti-depressant but not on a stabilizer like lithium which I'm on now. So I guess the anti-depressant was pushing me into mania and making me, couldn't make decisions. One time, I was invited to go visit my wife's people out of town, like maybe you just were, and I would actually get out onto the road and drive for 5 or 10 miles determined to do the right thing, maybe, and visit those people. Then I would realize I was in no state to visit with anybody and I would turn around and drive back. Again, I was on the wrong medicine(s). And so my mind and my indeciseiveness reflected that. You said earlier you take pills, what are you taking? How are you diagnosed? It sounds like you're not on the right medicine. You can use this to access where you are, and make an effort to correct that. You've been misdiagnosed, you've been miss medicated. Can you use that to cha
nge? To stay on the same medicine and the same diagnosis when you obviously are still having problems doesn't seem to be the way to go. Do you have a psychiatrist? If so, when is your next appointment? You say, ""what can i do...theres nothing i can do...not go...cause more upheaval..ughhhh."" I think you were right not to go. You don't have to set that off with a defeat. Set off your victory of not going with another victory. You're automatically heading for another defeat. It's your thinking that's tripping you up.

You are an intelligent woman with ideas and goals. You have been stable for quite a while. Honestly I cannot wrap my mind around why you are feeling this way. Now you’re giving up on school and any possibility of work? You are far too young and vibrant to be sleeping all day and with energy levels of a slug. There is something wrong somewhere. The way I see it you are never going to feel “whole” until you break from mom. The only way to do that is to become independent...with a job. I would research doctors. If you’ve recently been and everything was a-ok then maybe it’s time to see an alternative provider. Look into nutritionists, acupuncturists, holistic docs, whatever. If western medicine can’t do it then look elsewhere. Write down how much all the consults etc will cost and make your mom a “wellness proposal”. Ask for it for C
hristmas or something. She wants you to be well and lose weight...tell her the plan youve made withtgese providers so she knows you’re serious. Ya gotta do something Newt.

175959527,"Yet, that isn't a given anymore. I had no idea what I wanted to do after finishing school. I lived at home, then I lived in places no one really was bothered having me at. I was never particularly interested in a partner or kids. I was still asking myself the age old question of ""what do i want to be when i grow up"" and sitting there with my mouth hanging open. This all around 22-23 and isn't too atypical for my generation. I suppose I had existential issues then. I also had them around 18-19 when i realized it's actually hard work and determination that makes a person successful instead of raw talent and adult approval. That's a hard pill to swallow. Go from hero to zero real quick. i hadn't put effort into a single thing in my life up to that point and it was a cold splash of water to the face. I'm left questioning who I am compared to everyone else and realizing I'm not all that important. The age teenage narcissism dies."

I was in your situation about a year ago and know that going to the hospital is not desirable. Thus, please call your psychdoc! You might need a medication increase. I was on 400 mg per month of maintena for about 8 months. The shot really worked but took some time. I am now on 300 mg. I just took it easy for about 6 months. It really helped. Just sleep if possible. And, don't get into trouble. I was boisterous during the night for several months and got kicked out of one complex. Please get help and don't react to your voices in a bad way."
175959529,Hi _PERSON_ Welcome back good to hear from you but sorry to hear you are having a tough time. Pleased to hear you have got sober that should improve things. Use your self help skills to help with anxiety or have a look at our resources for a recap. Keep us posted. _PERSON_

175959532,"So sorry o hear it searching. Plus when you are feeling so bad it makes a dismissal even worse. For me now I know at least for the most part why I am feeling so bad, but still I was told my thyroid was near coma levels so it will be 8 weeks before I am feeling more normal. Today I just felt achey and such exhaustion and mentally like a zombie. All I want to do is sleep, but then I try not too because of insomnia. Every night fall asleep like a ton of brick but then I am awake by 3 am and can’t do back to sleep. So have you seen a rheumatologist searching? That is were my tangled ball of yarn began to unwind. Way back in 2006. I had already been dx’_NAME_ with hypothyroidism and _NAME_’s disease early on and told ‘if you take your medication you should feel normal”.....ahhh, no. Not even close. So I pushed just like you. Saw a rheumatologist who did a whole bunch of antibody testing. Antibodies are all specific to certain disease. Then they told me that they wished they could tell me I had 
Lupus but it is bigger than that. I have heard what I deal with called Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder. Basically several auto immune diseases “over-lapping” each other. So more testing....now I am hypothyroid, _NAME_’s disease, _PERSON_’s syndrome, Lupus, are the main diagnosis with some spin-off problems like ITP (low platelets, osteoporosis,gall-bladder doesn’t work and gastroparesis (very slow gut motility). The rheumatology appointment was everything in learning how to understand my body and read my body and care for it. It is all a challenge to manage but I do really well....amazingly.... So now I have a wonderful rheumatologist, my new wonderful endo/internalize, (I am so thankful for that, you have no idea) a nurse practitioner that’s only so so and a GI doctor that is also only so so. Maybe you could seek out a rheumatologist for some anti bodies testing? Hang in there and know you are not mistaken....no-one would just make pain and illness like this up. Be very kind to yourself and try 
not to live to far into the future this will take time. You don’t want to wear yourself out trying to push to hard to fast. Work at it with determination and intent but take care of yourself along the way. My total dx took years all total. Wishing you some rest, and peace. _PERSON_"

We are never going to be accurate in our objective assessment of how others see us anyway, in the same way we may not be accurate with our subjective self exploration.

175959580,"Juice from concentrate has vitamin C, but much less than fresh juice because it has been pasteurized, which degrades some of the vitamin. Fresh citrus fruits, however, contain chemicals that work synergistically with the vitamin C to bolster its effects in the body, making it more effective, healthwise. Many of these antioxidants and flavonoids are either discarded when the fruits are made into juice, or are destroyed during processing. If you are deficient in certain vitamins, it's fine to take them in chemical (vitamin pill) form, but you should they to get as much of them from whole foods as you can. I myself am rich in vitamin O, which has yet to by synthesized artificially and therefore is best absorbed via meat injection."

I think it will give you a lot of needed support. I hope that you do. In the meantime, breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Called smelling the roses and blowing out the candles. It sure does help when anxious. It does me anyway. I think it connects you back with yourself. I hope you had a good New Year's eve. I stayed home. Was in bed by 8:00 actually.

I can't handle reality because I'm scared of how crazy things are.. Like for example; This guy, on a trip to India, went to a city where people burn bodies of people that don't want to be reincarnated anymore on this earth.. And some bathe in the the river ""Ganges"" for life.. This guy was just sitting there watching a body being cremated and his face sunk in and turned into ashes and a kid was standing beside him, practicing counting so he was like ""One.. Two.. Three.. Four"" while smiling.. It's things like that in the midst of chaos that happens to me all the time. I can't really stand it because it happens way too often. Maybe that's what psychosis is.."

Went to some stores and looked around but didn’t buy anything. We went for a drive today. My mom won like $80 on the lottery so we went around to find a new place to buy tickets. Hopefully we’ll win something with more zeroes attached. Saw some nice neighborhoods we could dream about living in when I’m making lots of money. I was planning on doing studying this weekend and maybe do a quiz or two or an assignment but the website was doing maintenance all weekend so I couldn’t log on. Oh well. I gotta switch to studying for my exams they’re only a couple weeks away. Eek. Also I’m trying to think of what three courses I want to take l

We have been doing phone sessions since lockdown with the Covid thing. I think M is ghosting my mom. M was sick for 2 weeks with terrible vertigo. Then the next week M didn't call so after 15 mins into the appointment we called the M. M said that she was ""just about to call."" Normal session and a confirmation of next week's appointment. This week we had to all again after 15 mins into session but no answer. M has pulled this crap before. M is unreliable and even in office visits she would no call no show. I fear for my mother's mental health. We are at a critical point in her mental work. Mom doesn't want a new therapist as M is supposidly the best in the area and top for Multiple identities aka DID. Mom doesn't want to ""start again"" with a new therapist. But even now she can see M is not reliable. I think Mom is too close to M and 
needs a new one. Her backstory is years long. It might be useful to begin again since more memories have come to light. I'm at a loss of what to do."

175959674,"I am a figure skater, a college student, and the rink I went to was shut down on March 13. I skate at lakewood ice in lakewood, CA. I've skated at PV ice chalet (now known as promenade ice chalet) and skating edge ice arena. I would even go to other rinks on vacation. I hate that it did, I went to the doctors office that day to get stitches off and my coach had sent a text to us the rink was closed due to covid. I hate that the rink shut down for this reason. I last went to school on March 12. I miss the rink, my coach, the atmosphere of the rink, and feeling accomplished when my coach tells me good job. She's an amazing coach and I miss her tons. I miss talking to her while I drink my water and I had gotten back with her after she came back from maternity leave from having her 2nd baby. I know theres worse out there. I know people are dying from this nasty virus, people are working essential jobs and are exhausted, people are struggling to feed themselves and their families, people are out of a jo
b completely, peopme who dont have internet or a computer to keep working or doing online learning, even people who dont have a home. I know those things are happening but I still miss skating. I had a coach I was working with while she was away and I had been keeping in touch with this one for fun. She suggested I exercise with off ice exercises but I can't seem to motivate myself to do it. I just really have been spending more time with my family since that happened. I know going back to skating will probably be different and I am nervous on what they are going to do when we come back. I need to give my coach a hug badly, she gives the best hugs and she's fun to talk to. She never yelled at me and she's an amazing mommy for her 2 adorable boys. Just even hearing her stories about her kids has made me feel happy. Add on online schooling with no skating and it's even more stressful. It's like a passion I've had since I was 10 was taken away from me. I've only been working with my coach since 2018 and she does 
keep us up to date on a lot of things happening. I miss her dearly, I worry I won't get another hug by the end of the year and I won't get to share the warm fuzzy feelings about christmas as well since I love doing so. I even loved telling her about my trips to Disneyland and I loved hearing about hers. I cried about 3 times the other day and I haven't cried about the rink in the 3 months I've been away. I just miss my passion and seeing her smile during my lesson, I work so hard that I was willing to do whatever it takes to be a better skater. I can't deal with no hugs or no ice anymore, this is one way of expressing myself. My pink hair adds to my personality and it helps me stand out from everyone else. I need to go back to the rink badly and see my coach. This has gotten to me more than anything."

175959687,"I’m a 54 year old man who up until about 10 years ago had a pretty good thing going on with life and happiness. I’ve been married for 21 years, three boys, two dogs, and a wife that has lost complete respect for me. I’ll try to keep this reasonably short and to the point, but with everything I’ve experienced, it may be difficult. To break things down, seven years ago I lost my job of 26 years because of consolidation. My expectations in life were to pursue a new career in voice-over acting, (I used to consider myself quite talented). It was at this point where everything began to fall apart. Shortly after my retirement and learning the voice-over art, I became cardio ill, so violently that my excessive coughing broke my seventh rib (very painful). I was diagnosed with COPD and put on a daily regiment of medication which ultimately destroyed a portion of my voice, and my hope of succeeding in my new career path. I spent may hours and many days with the doctor in hopes of remedying the situat
ion to no avail. Since that time I’ve lost my Father to Parkinson’s disease, lost my car, filed bankruptcy, diagnosed with medicinal E.D. And with a lifetime of dental problems my teeth are now falling out. Aside from all the physical problems, the worst thing is that my wife has lost all respect for me believing that I’m lazy, worthless, and useless interfering in her successful career as an RN. I managed to secure a minimum wage job stocking shelves in the middle of the night at a grocery store. Unbelievable as it sounds but I’m thankful for coronavirus because of my COPD, I’ve been in quarantine and unemployment since March. I’ve lost all my friends or desire to have friends, and I’m just tired of dealing with all this pain and anguish, and find myself frequently thinking about the next life or whatever God has in store for me. I definitely don’t want to sit down with any groups and hash out all my problems in hopes that things will turn around. I just want to fade away, nobody cares anyhow

175959697,"Suicidal thoughts or attempts are a horrible mental illness that has effected me for years... I am lucky to have eventually gotten the right therapy for this when it has happened. One of the biggest problems with this is other people's denial of this happening. I need everyone to know this is real and I've never lied about it or sought help for suicide for any other reasons. I would never fake this for any reason. I know it's hard on everyone. It's been very hard on me. It comes from being severely depressed with no future in sight at the time of the suicidal thoughts. LET ME STRESS THAT I AM NOT FEELING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS NOW I AM GOOD RIGHT NOW. In the past when my depression has gotten severe enough to do it I have tried a few times I have been lucky to have messed it up completely and servived. At some point finally I had the suicidal thoughts and realized this is the time to call for help. Everyone in this situation please don't be afraid to call 911 for help. I have done it a few times now. Th
at is how I got the therapy and help I needed for the suicidal thoughts and it has stopped me from the attempts. They rush to your aid right away. The 911 operator assures you they are coming to help. They don't treat you bad. They check you into emergency then transfer you right away to a behavioral unit or Psychiatric hospital and both are a huge help. They give you therapy a nice room, food and most of all the time to heal. You meat with psychiatrist and social workers every day until you get better then they help you with a plan to get back to life after enough days of therapy and medication. I have done this 4 times and every times and every time has helped me cope... Don't be afraid to get help for suicidal thoughts before you make it to the point of attempting bcuz I consider just the thoughts hurting yourself and others that love you..."

175959722,A relative is very mad at me for saying the virus isn't any worse than a bad flu strain.
175959723,Well a lot of that was probably the drugs making you not give a ****. ThatÂ’s why a lot of people do drugs. To not give a **** about life or to survive a mind that self hates and self destruct.

175959726,"I learned a LOT about myself tonight - Just like every night that I stayed up. But tonight was profound. Now I'll try and get some sleep. Remember, it's OK to be scared. We're all scared of something.. Even Atypical Disaster.. It keeps us alive.. Literally. Could be a delusion... But what does that delusion represent? Where does it stem from? Trauma? Who knows.. Only you will decide.. And sometimes people become outcasts.. They don't fit in with any group.. Everyone has their group.. Love and fear. There's many things that all the ""crazy"" people talk about.. Or the demons, witches, types of animals.. It's like everything in reality is written as a story.. ""Do you believe?"" - ""He was lying! He's not telling the truth"" - ""Oh.. A mystery to be solved"" - ""Find the hidden key"".... ""You can do it!"" ""Don't listen to them"".. (This is basically what voices stem from... Nonsense.. At least for me anyways..).."
175959727,"I have a question. Can y’all tell when you are in an episode of psychosis? All I know is I start to feel weird. Physically. And mentally. Otherwise I will feel ok. And then I start talking to people about weird stuff and I’ll do weird stuff. Idk why. When I start to hear voices later on and start to develop a delusion, I have to nip it in the bud really quick cuz it can get out of hand in no time, flat."

175959735,Why is that falcs?
175959736,My therapist mentioned a medication called saphris. She’s gonna talk to my pdoc and if she says it’s okay and my insurance approves it then we’ll try that. If not then it will be the clozaril. She says she has a couple clients on it that it helps a lot (the saphris)

175959739,"Hi HT, I hope you are getting a good sleep right now. Hope everybody is having a good day or night depending where you are."
175959740,"Hm. I dont think theres anything wrong with my ear lobe. I have noticed its always been a little more red than the other side. And thicker too. I think its thicker than the other side because when my parents got my ears pierced (i was 3 years old) I'm assuming it was off a little on either side. So one side the under lobe has always been thicker. The other one, thinner. Idk. But I notice the thicker one (my left) I've always had more trouble with it, with gauging it to bigger sizes. Since I was 14 or 15 when I started. I will get more polysporin, new gauges (I've been wearing the same ones for 4 years), and I wont wear them in the shower anymore (which causes buildup between the lobe and plug. ""Wet ear""). I should probably take my rings off too while I'm at it, because the shower causes them to lose shine faster with all the soap and stuff. And who knows what else."
175959741,Sorry it going a bit rough for you guys. :/ Sending thoughts of encouragement and perseverance your way. Draw deep. You are stronger than you realize... ...but also self care so you can keep on being amazing and work your management. S.C.

I need to focus tomorrow though, I haven't really studied all week and I want to get these courses as done as quickly as possible. Especially now with a near total lockdown I won't have any reason to leave my house for anything so I should work, and study more."
175959748,I just watched a show about a woman going through pregnancy and she has bipolar disorder
175959749,So yesterday was my first dose of generic lexapro at 5mg which is what I’ve always used before on brand name. And only side effects I’ve felt where drowsiness and dry mouth. I thought I would have trouble sleeping and in my past experiences I usually get insomnia the first night or two and I slept well. And idk if this is some placebo effect but I feel okay. Recently I was waking up with anxiety in the mornings (not severe) but I didn’t wake up anxious today. The last time I was on lex the same thing happened to me where I felt relief the first week but that time I did get a few more side effects which were tolerable. I’m glad I feel okay but it is sort of scary at the same time. My anxiety was pretty mild so idk if maybe that’s why.
175959750,I feel like I have so many thoughts in my head I can’t express them all. I think I’m annoying my RL work friends hahaha. Oh man. I’m so distracted from work.
174347790,Just out of curiosity do you hear voices when falling asleep or just at night in general?
175959751,"I feel like there's a specific mind state that people can be in to manifest their destiny based on living in the moment and using their emotions, intellect, spiritual side, etc.. Being able to do anything they want with the randomness of reality.. I've heard about this and I'm coming closer to it but I'm a long way away from actually being in tune with it. It's like a musical dance of life. Expression, capturing, problem solving, letting go of certain things.. I'm becoming alive yet feel so alone too."
175959752,its not much of a story but ill upload one later for at the moment I don't have time.
175959753,Iced Tea and a pumpkin cream cold brew from Starbucks this morning
175959754,"Hi _PERSON_ and welcome I can totally relate to how you feel because my thought patterns are pretty much the same and I struggle with health anxiety. I had a _NAME_ angioma on my scalp and when I searched what it was a long time ago I read that it was really a harmless thing. From many sources on the internet. Then one day when I was having a haircut the hairdresser accidentally got rid of it for me So since you have it for two years now and it didn't get worse, I think you really don't need to focus on that much. If you are not scared of having blood works done, then you can simply ask your Dr to check on the things you are worried about. They will give you some answers at least, better than googling it I promise. Distract yourself meanwhile, try to stay in the now."
175959755,Just talked to him about his foot. He think it might be a medical condition. I'm really worried. I hope he doesnt have diabetes or idk what else.
175959756,"You can rebuild.....it’s doesn't Have to be pain...I know I was picked on for most of my school years so I thought people were just bad and I didn’t now want to be around them. Now I actually like having people around because they’ve matured and I know how to pick the good ones. Try audio books if you can’t read, usually that works."
175959757,"I drink it throughout the whole day , I'm trying to cut back though"
175959758,"I hate to see you suffer so much, if you don't mind me asking, what have you tried? I use to have 2 severe panic attacks a day, it's hell. ANd when We're not having one we're worried it's going to happen soon. Have you tried benzos or ssri's? A surprise solution for me was lamictal a mood stabilizer, and before that lithium worked. I don't know why but having lamictal was a really good one. Do you eel them in your stomach rise? LIke are they physical panic attacks?"
175959759,"I feel like just staring at the wall. This morning I was staring out the window watching cars go by. I said, ""If a car goes right, everything will be ok. If it goes left, it wont"" (I always do things like this). But for the first time I just said, ""If a car comes any way, things will be ok"". Then a car came and went to the right. Probability, change, supernatural realm of whatever metaphysical life I'm in - I don't know. I'm just depressed and scared and feel like a horrible person."
175959760,Have fun! I'm sorry you slept through your appointment. I've done that too!

175959763,"Heard back from the hospital yesterday. I had wrote the hospital a letter complaining about the ER doctor. I don't think anything is really going to happen. He treated me like crap and his treatment of me was negligent. I could file a complaint with the medical board. I have to think about it. I doubt anything would come of it. I feel heard though. The lady on the phone was nice. She said I'm basically going to get a form letter but that she is forwarding the complaint to the correct office. I'm not angry now. I don't usually get angry but when I do it's for a good reason. Might be time for me to just let this go. Now that I've been heard, I feel like that's something. Even if nothing happens to him: really I just want him counseled on being more considerate and empathetic and compassionate towards people with MI, but even if nothing happens to him, at least someone heard me. Doesn't mean they care. Maybe no one cares about me. At least I cared enough to stand up and not take that crap laying down. 
I feel a bit empowered. HUGS all, _PERSON_"
175959764,I really appreciate you guys here
175959765,"Today is not a good day. I forgot and took the full dose of my geodon, and I am exhausted as hell. I literally cant function at work. My brain is completely shut off and I feel _USER_ID_, cuz I'm so tired. Plus I have a headache. I'm gonna have to call my doctor and tell her to take me off the extra dose, cuz i cant be like this everyday."
175959766,I don't want to go to sleep again. they're watching me.
175959767,"GMF, Your dose is low, and you have only been back on your Rx for a short time. Add to this the fact that you are aware and concerned about a possible issue with continued daily use, and all this points to the fact that you do not at all fit the profile of someone who is going to have any trouble discontinuing your Xanax. As S20D said, using your Rx as a rescue med (pro re nata/as needed) is still alright... ...so seek to reduce to taking your pill only every other day for a week, then you can step off comfortably...I am sure of it. Best to you and keep us posted so we can keep you in support! S.C."
174347797,"_PERSON_; I saw my doctor and said that I'm doing good - And I am. I told him that I take two 15mg Dexedrine spansules in the morning due to tiredness and it helps me focus more. He said ""It's for ADD not tiredness"" but I said ""Without stimulants, I'm too tired to have ADD"". He doesn't know my past that in Ireland they didn't believe that ADHD exists so I was switched around, embarrassed that I never paid attention. Teachers bullied me and singled me out more than any other students did. He doesn't know that the main reason as to why I was prescribed a stimulant was because I was sleeping 18 hours a day in high school - Maybe because of the risperidone. Imagine.. Someone with schizophrenia that is so non-treatment resistant to antipsychotic medication and they work so well that I'm not even mentioning psychosis symptoms. It's the same thing as before: I was prescribed 36mg of Concerta in the morning and 36mg at noon - But taking two in the morning made it last the same amount of time. Now with 
Dexedrine, 15mg in the morning and 15mg in the afternoon, I take both in the morning. I then bought stimulants online, had the prescribed stimulant taken away and then given back because I did so terrible off of it. I feel like it's some sort of conspiracy that doctors are always hanging an easy perfect dose above my head for years like it's some type of law of physics in my reality. It makes me solipsistic and I'm sure it's an environmental psychosis symptom. But anyways he said that he will talk to me again next week when I need my meds refilled and he might prescribe 10mg Dexedrine IR in the late afternoon. He talks down on me like I'm stupid. He talks to everyone like they're stupid - Like my mom and sister too. I'm smarter than he thinks I am. *Rant over*..."
175959768,Antidepressants or Tolkien Bluebird this ones for you.....
175959769,I got the money from my phones but 15 dollars less. Oh well.
175959770,It’s weird they’re like 6 1/2 wide women’s shoes but I put them on they’re loose and such: I normally wear a 7 women’s. I got the boots because they’re around my size and the last one left. But tbh I probably fit a 6 women’s wide much better than 6 1/2.
175959771,And I have also taken my supplements.
175959772,"Yes I showered this morning and washed, dried, straightened my hair."
175959773,Yeah similar to what alcohol does
175959774,I really dont know what to do with my time today. Idk what to do at all. I feel like really low. Like sad. Maybe I will watch tv.

175959776,Still dealing with at least one delusion though.

I currently have my DS and 3DS cases in a plastic bin, while the rest are in bins at my parents' house. I don't know how many games I have, but I probably have like 500 or so. Sometimes I get random games when I buy a used Game Boy bundle off eBay b/c the person selling the console doesn't want their games, so like... I have 3 versions of Sapphire for GBA. lol. Same thing happens when I try to buy cheap games on eBay. The sellers just wanna get rid of everything, so they bundle stuff. I'll check out groovee.

175959782,I'm sorry. That sounds really stressful. HUGS Kit
175959783,"It's going to be kind of a stressful month with the med changes and some other stuff going on in my life but hopefully after that things start going a little smoother. I'm trying to budget my money better, my sister wants me to have at least a few months where I show I can budget good so then she can feel comfortable getting me made my own payee instead of her (she's my rep payee for SSI). So I'm working on being careful with my money, not impulse shopping and whatnot. It's hard but I can do it, it will just take some time to get myself out of old habits. _PERSON_ was good today, the food there is always great and the people are friendly. Went to Family Dollar afterwards and got some household necessities and a non-stick frying pan and baking pan so I can finally make scrambled eggs and bake chicken and things like that."

174347819,"Hi all, I have been on 20 mg of Prozac for 4 weeks now, and I am seeing no improvement. As a matter of fact, I seem to be more depressed and anxious. I have an appointment with my psych for Monday. I am disappointed, as I don't like this trial and error with medication. I was on 15 mg of lexapro prior, but it seemed to stop working. I read that lexapro is about twice as strong as prozac, so maybe my dose of prozac is too low, I don't know. I seem to be exhausted all the time, taking a shower is a chore. I was exercising daily, but since I started prozac, I am not able to do that. I tried abilify, that gave me involuntary muscle jerks, even at 2.5 mg, so I discontinued that. I will see what the psych has to say, but my hopes are not very high right now."
175959786,"You may have pulled some muscles by tensing up during the panic attack. If the doctor said that your heart is normal, then I would believe that. Panic attacks can give us some very real symptoms that lead us to believe the worst. Try to relax. Do some breathing exercises if you can. I don't know if there is a lot you can do to ease the pain other than wait for it to subside. If a person gets broken ribs there isn't much they can do for that either. Being the location and the type of bones. I think in a day or so you will be feeling better with the pain. When we get tense, we pull muscles. I hope that is all it is. Hang in there bambola2nv.

175959788,"Oh I am so very sorry to hear this. Do you have any support for yourself? It is so hard dealing with our kids addictions and the results of them. If you are on facebook, there are great support groups that you can join. I have found them to be very helpful, after the loss of my oldest son last year.I know The _PERSON_ Mom, _USER_ID_, has one and im sure there are others for parents with kids in active addiction, I am on a few others to support us that have lost children to addiction.

Worst were insomnia, higher blood pressure, frequent indigestion (and I have reflux/EOE which was nonexistent for months before starting EMSAM), chills, and shot my anxiety through the roof. Overall, I did not feel well on the patch so have discontinued. Any trials for SSRIs/SNRIs require me to be two weeks off the patch. The amount of time needed for the drug to be eliminated from my body. That's about it. Hope you all are doing well and thanks for contributing to this thread."

Feel pretty fair, not too bad on the depression front so far, so, maybe I can work for a bit. Managed to vacuum, brush teeth, clean kitchen and bathroom, so, that is a good sign. Place looks much better. I have been reconnecting with my 12 year-old by writing her a Cyclist Family Heritage History, from her great grandparents to today. She is the baby of all the babies in the whole family, so, she does not know really any of this stuff. Her mom says she is really enjoying it, which makes me so happy. She and I were apart for 5 years when I was in the hospital. Very painful for her and me. In the last installment, I told her about my depression and addiction to Ultram, tramadol. Horrific drug. So dangerous. Supe
r potent antidepressant, very much like Ketamine. Please do not start taking tramadol for your depression, you will never be able to stop... My ex said my daughter appreciates how candid and ""raw"" I have been in these little writings for her. That made me feel good. Certianly not trying to make myself look good, that is for sure.

175959798,"I don’t really have experience with this so I can’t say one way or the other about her calling her ex if that was a good idea, but it sounds like she’s so unhappy in her current relationship :/ From what you’ve said it sounds like he is being emotionally abusive and that’s not something to take lightly. I wonder if this video or any of Dr. _NAME_’s videos on his Surviving Narcissism channel would be helpful: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hqh_XuU-vi0 It sounds like you’re a great friend and want to do the right thing. Personally I think if you’re good friends with this person and you don’t think the relationship is right, you should be able to say that. I had a boyfriend I wouldn’t have had the courage to break up with if people in my life hadn’t told me they didn’t think we were right for each other.

175959802,"I think you're amazing for taking the big step of this proactive plan.

175959803,"I’m very lonely these days (past couple of months. Especially past month). I’ve reached out to quite a few people whom I thought would support me through this journey (which is all I can think about most times) and it somewhat backfired on me. Or I mean, I find out that they aren’t really genuine towards me or don’t care. I’ve had to delete like 9 family members from fb and a friend or two. Some of them I didn’t even talk to I admit, but rather deleted them by proxy. Family members. My moms family is... not the best. Lots of gossip etc especially about me and my mental health. I was called “psycho” by a few of my cousins when I got sick and also by some aunts and uncles. It’s weird... going through this journey you really think about the people you associate with and how will they ACTUALLY either contribute to your life or if they will continue to be genuine with you. Either way, if they aren’t one of those then it’s best not to have them in it. And with possibly being pregnan
t I’ve really been thinking not just about what I put in my body on a daily basis but also the people and situations I associate with and put myself in. Y’all are gonna have to forgive me, as this will be a topic for me for quite a awhile. My cat is going crazy. She does this every freakin morning lol. So cute!"

175959829,My period may be starting finally idk. But there’s like 2 or 3 days of my period I physically feel really good. That’s usually after day 1 of my period. And before day 4 or 5

175959840,"Yes, same. Since childhood. The poet Mark _PERSON_ does a good job of articulating a feeling that is hard to describe or pin down. It is more than the terms 'emptiness', 'loneliness' or 'feeling disconnected' describe, as often such feelings have a strange mix of beauty and sadness; elation and despair. A friend recently posted me an extract written by _PERSON_ on 'Living in a more light-hearted way'. He certainly paints things realistically and it is a welcome change from the usual platitudes; Although a little grim, and I think I need to find God to help me handle it, I appreciate the lack of sugar-coating. I totally agree. And while it may not fall under the category of 'neglect', the emotional damage it causes is far-reaching. I think it postpones the inevitable existential crisis for 20yrs or so. Kids grow up and leave home. That is when parents, especially the mother loses a sense of purpose and begins a journey those of us who have no kids, and who have mental health issues, have been on for 
many years. I guess the difference is, they seek solace from other 'empty nesters', socially and will re-fill the void with other people and of course grandkids. Then they die. True. And may I add 'non mainstream' to childfree. That is so great It is amazing how the 'right' person in our lives can help us so much; more than therapy or reading, or drugs. It is a gift to meet such a person in this life-time. I guess my process of self discovery (of being outside the bell curve) has happened in recent years through romantic relationships. I blamed my choices in men ( all had addiction problems and personality disorders to varying degrees) for my worn out and apathetic state of being. In learning to understand why I connected with such men, I have learned so much about my own 'weirdness' ( as compared to others). It is an ongoing battle ( as you say 24/7 ) to accept and 'know thyself' .. But it is 'something legit to strive for . Beats the superficial striving I see others engage in. What's on my mind today Somet

175959843,"There is a narc or antisocial trait in me where I just love to tear someone apart mentally/verbally in real life. Being able to, with a few words, tear someone apart completely for their being a monster feels great. It's the pauper's justice though, because unless it's a matter of public record that will follow them, they'll just revert and convince themselves something else happened and only momentarily acknowledge the void."
175959844,"Like _NAME_ mom, I find getting a SzA dx to be difficult as well. It took me 20 years to finally get that diagnosis (which I believe is the right one) and get on the correct medications. We can't diagnose here but if you are curious you could seek out a therapist or a psychiatrist to get an accurate diagnosis."

175959847,I’m being held back by my own discord. I’m letting people hold me back. And for what??? Cuz I love people and want my family to be ok with what I’m doing and listen to their thoughts to? For what? I mean ugh man. I just see this as another step in recovery. Making my own damn decisions in life. My parents are so damn afraid I’m gonna “fall and hurt myself”. Let me fall! Let me learn! Don’t talk down to me like I’m 18.
175959848,"You sound like a very passionate person PP... I hate when I get angry because I usually cry. Or I yell... I can't control it. It makes me feel helpless. . And I too can say some real hurtful things. I do a lot of meditation to try to be calm. Breathing exercises help too. Counting to 10. Maybe some CBT would help you. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It teaches us other ways to look at things and how to react to events that upset us. I guess I don't have many answers as I suffer from the same thing. I get angry but I hate it. So I try hard not to feel or react to these situations. I wish you all the best. I see you are new so I want to welcome you to Healing Well. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175959861,"I can see into myself. I'm just lifeless energy. Everyone is. You have to BE IN REALITY to truly appreciate it. If you look and see yourself in the eyes of another, you'd likely get a good amount of new perspective. Some things that you hate and some things that you like. But at first, it would freak you out.. looking through those goggles. You're then more likely to act differently. But less deeper than that, people unknowingly try to change things about themselves that they hate about themselves purposefully. And with me, people could pay attention to me through many more wireless technology platforms and I think about doing that lot but I don't even try to be heard about my experience but mostly perception. The way that I see the sky and your background. Where you are, how you feel, what you've done, your intentions.. But it doesn't matter in the end. Why? Because everyone says the same things just different ways. What are ""different ways""? It's MATTER. Physical! Ideas are physical! That means 
that thoughts can be visible and we can create them in a lab."

175959868,Happy first day of Fall everyone! Where I live fall is like 2 weeks long (hasn't started yet--we are still in Summer Temps) and then it snaps cold to Winter. I love Fall though. The crispness of the air. Wearing scarves and beanies. Etc. We usually get two weeks in October when it is fall like weather. Hoping it comes early this year because of the dang fires that are raging in CA and across the west. Cooler temps would help. So would rain. Anyone feel like doing a rain dance with me?

175959870,"This is a very important post and one in which I hope will gain much participation with regards to identifying standard patterns within the experiences of 'hearing voices' & the becoming more common experience of what's described on VH forums as thought broadcasting or what I call subvocalization live streaming, as that's what it's like to experience. As most bodily thoughts would by due to firing of neurons & synapse and be of a non vocalized manner, I mean when was the last time your leg spoke to you or your arm command to move in the opposite direction, most people because it's in your head naturally assume it's thoughts, well it's not, at best it's an internal dialogue most of us have to think clearly or just to get things straight within our private space, meaning our minds or heads. What was of interest would be the fact that your larynx muscles move even when you silently mime a single word or sentence, of which if sensors nodes were to be placed there would spell out upon a screen what you 
were saying. This would give the false impression of mind-reading this is a common mistake. So, during the experiences of 'voices' performing their allotted tasks of attempting blackmail or entrappment via trauma bonding or the dark use of NLP or triggering & anchoring to a various subliminal stimulus like pointing moble phones to hand signs a few years back, or using directed conversations to trauma bond you, so you would be negatively accessed by your covert team when ever they needed to perp you. This would be conducive to gang rape or cyber mobbing or molka as they would need to access you like in a form of entertainment with an acquired fetish within the social dynamics of the clandestine abuse network, as this activity changes all who are participating within them as with most things of this nature would adhere to these non-negotiable realities. Scapegoating and exploitation to produce humiliation are key for this to have a full effect upon the scapegoated and ultimately rejected victim or TI as we will 
be cast adrift to seek assistant elsewhere. Anyway, the main focus would be their almost schizophrenic OCD frenzyness for fake narratives like lines of pure Coke, it fuels their one-upmanship and need for sensationalism, involving more and more outlandish or potentially embarrassing detailed information in order to pass fake storylines and involve the target in some way, narcissistic abuse works strangely by the same presets. I personally have witnessed or experience this daily grind of 24/7 constant imposing of fake narratives disparate at times pure evil at others, constantly networking the fabricate narratives and confirming them with laughter and egging on, to almost witch hunt like KKK personnel percussions, I named them the trunk radio lynch mob. I've noticed their psycho tactics at attempting to engage with the scapegoated TI/VH with many tactics designed to involve you or to gain your acknowledgment so as you realized what's going on your awareness is an admission of guilt to the baying hive-minded ab
use networking sharing, spreading the fake accounts online in order to gain more power and dominance towards their mainly _USER_ID_ goals. I've known these to be acts of modern Zersetzung and very reflective of their cyberculture and even their almost b-movie-worthy pandemic COVID 19, was more than likely a _NAME_ outtake. It's basically a power and control-based abuse game that's perfectly covered up as an illness within the victim if they realize what's reality occurring within their daily lives. This is what's real!"

174347954,hi Disco1. i don't want to drift too far from the thread but in answer to your questions yes i take meds and yes i see myself as having an illness. i've been diagnosed as having schizophrenia for years. i see each channel as having a recall spectrum. these spectrums could be manipulated so aspects from each extreme of the spectrums infect each other to squeeze through definition. trying to maintain an identity within the collective cloud manipulation could be a channel's ongoing priority. i'm from England and recently moved from risperidone depot to paliperidone depot which has been working well for me.

I do mine monthly personally. We have this day because it can take 2 people to help work on hair and what not. Especially if you need it braided or something. I just wash my hair once a month because it’s extremely dry and fragile. I am mixed, so my hair is not kinky, but it is curly still. But I just straighten my hair. The straightening takes an hour maybe more. Some black women braid their hair and wear a wig or a front lace on their head. Most, I mean, do. I just have my natural hair cuz it’s easy to take care of cuz I’m mixed."

175959879,"Hi _PERSON_. I would of course not try to make a medical diagnosis on an internet forum, and in any event I am not qualified to do anything like that. But I can tell you that I sometimes feel winded or out of breath when I am particularly anxious. One thing that helps me, sometimes, in that situation, is a breathing meditation. (Some refer to ""mindfulness meditation""). There are some apps, such as Insight Timer, that have a lot of free guided meditations. It does not require any knowledge or expertise -- you just slowly breathe, usually in through the nose, and out through the mouth, and focus on your breath. When your mind wanders to other things (which it will), try to bring your attention back to your breath. Good luck."
175959880,Yeah but you said half a stimulus so wouldn’t that be $700? Minimum I guess.

175959913,Yes! Definitely ask them to monitor it. When I went inpatient I had been on lithium for a couple months. I’d had my levels checked once and they never said anything about it. Well when they took my blood at intake they accused me over and over again of not taking it because I was on a high dose and nowhere near a therapeutic level. They grilled my husband about it and he actually brought them my bottle to prove I’d been taking it. They of course said I must be throwing it away. I never ever did. I took it faithfully. Best to be sure it’s doing what it’s supposed to.
175959914,Thank you! I have been thinking about going to therapy.

175959923,"I am bipolar/manic depressive, in addition to having anxiety, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and cardiac issues. I am a survivor. Six heart attacks have failed to take me, thank God. But the years-long battle to survive has taken a toll on my psyche. I am now a shut-in. Not in the sense that Covid-19 has made most of the world shut-ins, but rather a full-blown at times -- I am a Gemini and twins battle it out constantly -- extrovert who has succumbed to the introverted side of me. Always one to keep people at an emotional and psychological distance, the fact that my inner circle shrank over time is unsurprising. We all prune our trees of life during the course of our lives. But most of humanity has that one friend that is there through thick and thin. Some of us do not have that. I made poor choices in ""friends"" and ""friendships"" for the better part of two decades. The fact that I was undiagnosed and untreated during that time is not an excuse for the hedonistic lifestyle that I lived. One cannot

The question, ""Where is square one?"", is derived from the fact that intense therapy, finding the ride medications and levels, and family support pulled me from that fog. I put myself through and completed college. My health is the best it has been in years. I am ready to get back out into the world. To contribute. To work. To experience. But I am petrified because I do not know anybody out there in the world, anymore. I become mentally-paralyzed when I contemplate starting a job around not just new people, but people in general! I am so introverted now that I am much more of a thinker and listener than a speaker. And that has caused some miscommunication as some have felt that my quiet distance (my own personal safe place, bubble) is arrogant disinterest. So, where is square one? How does one come out of this type of isolation and re-enter 
society? And do it in a healthy fashion? Not just for me, but for others because I do not want to make them feel uncomfortable, either. Believe me, it is uncomfortable enough just for me."

175959925,Watched Caliphate on netflix. It was surprisingly good. It is one of those dramas that leave you heavy hearted the next day. Very thought provoking.

175959928,Hi _PERSON_. Another place you could look is a website called 7 Cups. One of the things they do is have people like us as well as volunteers on 24/7 chat support groups. I’m glad you’ve been able to ask for help on here. I wish you the best and hope you continue to let us know how you’re doing.

175959931,"I talk to my pdoc tomorrow and man do I ever need her help. Like clockwork, I wake up at 430am every morning and can't fall back to sleep. A guy at work is very angry so he didn't show up to work today, no call-no show. I hope he feels better by monday. He really dislaikes the new guys and I hope it doesn't become a problem. Their new, so expectations should be low. It's non-stop with my revelations of how terrible a person I was, (still am?). Every day I'm reminded and it's really distressing me again. I talked to my therapist and he gave me a good perspective on it, and he's right that mental illness is the root cause, and certain reactions are a sort of survival mechanism."

175959939,"I agree with _PERSON_Time. Definitely make some time to talk this over with your husband and openly express your feelings honestly, maybe over a favorite meal or take-out that you guys both enjoy. There's a proverb that comes to mind, “Plans fail when there is no consultation, but there is accomplishment through many advisers.”—Proverbs 15:22. If no one communicates, no one can solve any problems. Also see if you can think of some doable solutions, like are there any trips that you could accompany him? Or like someone else mentioned, when he does get back, maybe a quick weekend away or even just a fun staycation (cause I know COVID) where you shut all the phones off, have your favorite foods and music or games, whatever you guys like to do together, binge watch a favorite show that maybe he looks forward to since he's on the road so much, and make it all about you two reconnecting. I hope you find something that works for you both."

She only lives 20 miles away which is super cool. A librarian. I told her what I'm reading and she had absolutely no idea what I was talking about which is about normal. I confessed my job on the site so i don't get discrimination when I actually talk about it. I'm really sick of that. I read a comment where a famous romantic wrote that we only have 3 stories in us. Another said that we repeat them throughout our entire lives. I've always wondered about this. I feel like the short story I just wrote one of mine for sure. Also, I already need another bookcase."

I’ve sent letters to her. Even to my nephew. I don’t even know if they’ve received any of them. I don’t get a call or text about anything I’ve sent. Including gifts for my nephew for holidays. She’s just like my mom. Even my mom isn’t fully like that tho. Sad. I have friends that treat me better than most of my family. I told my mom I was done trying to have a relationship with my sister. I’ve been on about it for the past year. Even tho it’s been happening for 5 years. I’m someone who feels like if someone can’t give u 20 min of their time to even talk, for five years? Forget it then. I see where Im prioritized. At the very bottom. I love her but it’s time to stop trying. I just look like a fool now."
174348070,"I don't have sz, but I have psychotic features with my depression. I don't have a lot of delusions, but I have a few. Like for example Possible trigger: I believe there is something wrong with my blood. That there is black gooey stuff that floats along with my blood and it gels together at certain points and needs help getting out of my body. To combat that delusion (which I'm not sure it's a delusion but other people have told me it is a delusion) one of my T's is making me research how blood gets cleaned in the body. I don't know about the cancelling things. I don't cancel too much of the time but I also don't make loads of plans. Sometimes when I cancel I just don't feel good though. I do have other diagnosis besides depression with psychotic features so I don't know if that helps or hurts me in terms of the cancelling things.

175959955,"Thank you so much. I really appreciate your kind words. It is so comforting to know I'm not alone and that other people understand how I feel. I don't have any family that truly understand my illness and I haven't told any friends because I was embarrased and didn't want them to look at me differntly. I have accepted my illness but I still have trouble being open about it with other people. That is something I need to work on. I am so glad I joined this forum. I would like to join a support group as well. I like the 5 bipolar rules that you follow. All five are so helpful when you have bipolar. When I don't get a good nights sleep it can trigger my illness, and forget about booze, I went that route and it made my illness so bad I was close to being hospitalized several times. I'm working on the ""eating healthy"", I like sweets, lol and the surround yourself with positive people is so so true. I had to literally walk away from many family members and friends to try and stay healthy."

175959980,I think I was misdiagnosed with spd many years ago because I fit the criteria at the time and I had completely withdrawn from society. I chose to exit a lot of my relationships/friendships because I really needed to change my lifestyle so I could pick up my relationship with my daughter. This didn't happen instantly and for many years I sat behind closed curtains and got very drunk alone and because of this became extremely depressed and spiraled down into the depths of my mental illness. In the end I did attempt to put an end to it all and as a result got labelled with this PD. Didn't know what it was though until I came here. In answer to the thread I would choose to be alone because I'm trouble. I attract trouble and I bring trouble so its just a safer way for me to live. I'm not actually alone in a physical sense but mentally/emotionally I am pretty closed off.

175959984,"Saw my psychiatrist. I felt a little anxious - I think it was cuz of the weed yesterday. I mentioned that I'm doing well/have a greater improved quality of life on the olanzepine and Vyvanse. He prescribed a years worth of Invega Trinza, 5-10mg of Dexedrine in the evening and a refill of olanzepine 10mg. I mentioned that I might move to the Island in 1-2 years and he said that he would help me with the disability transfer papers etc.. I said that I'd like to keep my meds the same as much as possible for longer so they don't change them when I move. I said that I'm not dependent on the phenibut anymore and I'll stop taking it eventually. Because of the mild anxiety though (From the weed), I took some just now so I can be calm when I explain to my mom about the appointment. My mom and sister are worried about my apathy because I wasn't enjoying skiing and waiting in the car sometimes - I mentioned this to the psychiatrist. I said that my negative symptoms are good apart from the apathy/anhedonia but 
I'm ok with it - I shower every second day or every day, do hygiene and chores every day and that I'm happy now that I'm back at work part time. I said that I want to go to school and study general courses. He said that he doesn't want my mental illness to get in the way of my life and being able to do anything I want. I see my doctor on Wednesday and he'll prescribe atenolol, zopiclone, clonazepam and PRN. I still have 2 weeks worth of Vyvanse so I'll see him for a check up two weeks later after that - But when I see him, he'll give me the results of my new blood test which I'm sure is ok. ^-;"

175960038,I just woke up 10 min ago and I feel nauseous idk why
175960039,"Meth is like Adderall except people take larger doses. It's not a spiritual drug say if he was doing shrooms every once in a while in the woods away from his gf's kid. People get violent on meth and I've noticed on meth that I was getting OCD thoughts of killing everyone. Idk if it was psychosis but if it was, god was telling me to do it. It was hard to wean myself off of it but I managed to do it slowly. Most people take it until they build tolerance and when you stop, you sleep constantly and feel depressed and it's very addictive so all you want is another hit. He won't stop most likely. No one just quits meth on their own. I managed to do it because I have a loving family and support and there was no reason to be reckless. The people that do meth like it for the fun, productivity, euphoria and reckless ""tweaking"" behaviour. Meth addicts know what they want. They know what they're getting themselves into. Unless they're like me and is a nice person that just had a problem with addiction to ADH
D meds because I have idk narcolepsy and sick of sleeping all the time. It increases adrenaline and can last up to 24 hours after one hit. People lose sleep which can cause impaired judgment. There's no reason to do meth unless you're being reckless and want more out of life than taking care of your gf and her kid. He could just want her for support about the underlying reasons he's doing the meth and sex. Idk why a mother would want to have a meth addict in her life unless.. (Fill in the blank). She will probably hate you for reporting it but it's for the sake of the child. It's her fault. It also depends on when he started taking meth. I would understand if she didn't know about the meth addiction before dating him. If I was the ex, I'd 100% definitely want to know and would take the child away and blame the mother. Meth addiction just gets worse not better unless the person does something illegal out of antisocial behaviour to get more meth and gets arrested or gets help from an addictions counsellor which 
they don't even want help most times."
174348196,"No idea what hospital in the area that would do that. I'm afraid to try a new hospital after my last experience at the hospital I tried. It was a newer hospital but was dirty as ****. Wouldn't let my family visit because they didn't make it 15 minutes prior to visiting hours even though they called and said they'd be a little late. Wouldn't let me try latuda because they didn't ""have"" it. I suggested Saphris and shut me out and went back to a med that ended me up in the hospital again. Yeah **** them. If I need to go back to the hospital I might as well try _NAME_ Springs East again and hope I don't end up with the same doctor. No, but if there was I'd probably have my mom take me. There's Netcare but they'd just pink slip me and send me off to a hospital either way."

Not in the sense of bullying or other workplace cutthroat nonsense, but in the sense that in some ways it's not at all a stretch to compare it to sexual harassment. You're being asked to step out of your personal comfort zone for reasons which (I assume) have absolutely nothing to do with your performance or job description, all for the comfort (read:satisfaction) of your co-workers. Worse, there's nothing you can do. Being ""fired for introversion"" is not a thing. None of his business. Nor is it any business of your coworkers. Is there a human resources department within the organization that employs you? Your superior is very unprofessional. I seem to remember you saying at some point that you were a very productive employee, maybe also something about being given extra responsibilities due to your work ethic? Doesn't matter. You're in danger of being fired because you're a bit creepy. An

But I couldn't help but catch feelings because I'm a sensitive person and a late bloomer without much experience with dating as well. It's just that he told me he loved me before he blocked me and dated someone else. As of today right now. I definitely feel better and have a better sense of peace within myself.

You should just know that there is a whole apparatus in the brain that identifies self and other constantly. It is a whole, big thing. In us, aspects of this system, which includes all visual processing, go awry. Break. So, I woke up three or so days ago and was terrified because my brain told me I was a character in a video game, not a human. Had to ask a schizophrenia bud if it was true. She laughed. I'm like, no. For serious. She's like, bro, that' s your illness telling you that. You're good. So relieved. What you have is very likely just your unique version of this process. The question then, is, why? What is the current med lineup and doses? I do suspect you can improve this, maybe a lot. Maybe make it totally go away. Maybe. Partly. _PERSON_.

I believe listening to those podcasts will help me understand more about my mom having cancer and what I can do to help her state of mind because she's not dealing with it very well. She's denying that she has cancer and is really stressed out, drinking too much wine, wanting to refuse chemo and not caring about her severe heart conditions anymore by not taking her beta blockers on time.

175960072,"Hi everyone. I’m having some issues lately. I’ve been diagnosed with SZA disorder since 3 yrs now. Everything has been going in the right direction with all the meds and support I’m getting, until recently. Two weeks ago I stopped sleeping completely. Lots of energy and thoughts about cleaning and rearranging the house during the night! During the day my energy levels are minimal but when the dark comes, here’s where it all starts. No matter what I do I just cannot fall asleep, even sleeping pills don’t work. I had to take tavor last night to finally get some sleep. What’s interesting is that in the morning I don’t feel worn out, everything is normal, I can take care of the child, cook, clean etc. function normally. My doctor told me this could be an onset of mania. I used to have it before, same sleep disturbance, same energy rush. Ah and I forgot the optimism. I\m not an optimistic person,always anxious something can go wrong, however I’ve been an optimist these days. I would appr
eciate it if you guys could share your experience on this topic."
175960073,"Thanks! Yeah that’s understandable. We have coronavirus in this county now but I can’t avoid going places, I have to walk or take the bus to do things and get to appointments, shopping.

175960076,"Hey there. I’m sorry you got the virus. That must have been scary. There are a lot of unknowns about coronavirus still, and I am by no means an expert, but I found a good FAQ by the Penn State Institute of Life Sciences. My understanding from it is that if you have isolated yourself for 10 days since the beginning of your symptoms and it’s been 3 full days since you’ve had fever or other symptoms that you should no longer be contagious. Also, people develop antibodies to the virus if they’ve caught it themselves that should protect them from getting it again for at least a few months (until the strain changes because it might mutate). Since you’ve been cleared to be out, even if you may be having minor symptoms still, he got the virus too and has those antibodies, so I don’t think you’re going to give it to him again.

I know he's not trying to mess with me and that he actually believes in it. Idk why people believe in conspiracy theories like that. Finding meaningful patterns in things that don't exist.. Idk.. It's really strange to me. I feel really weird talking to him like I'm tripping and wonder if I should take an olanzepine. Reality can't be that much of a structure that everything is wrong.. Like _NAME_ hawking is a conspiracy then? I don't buy it. I thought my friend was smart or he is but could have psychosis. I feel like people are watching me live my life and controlling my thoughts.

Recently for a couple of days I have been going through tremendous amount of anxiety (or at least I can say it's a prolonged panic attack) which causes all of the muscles in my body to get tense and I feel irritated. Above all, I feel so blurry in my mind and I think this is what people call foggy brain and also I have rushing thoughts and it feels like I am not able to cope with them and I am going to lose my mind.

I do only say this as I remember you were wanting to sell your home before and rent a place. In my humble opinion, these are everyday trials that we face in life. No matter where you live, there are going to be repairs as things wear out. But... You know your situation much better than I do. You know what you have been going through with your home.

I have had the chance to return to work but am new and despite having years of experience, when I say I know how to do something, no one listens. They don't hear me. They don't see me. No matter how much I try, I feel like no one wants to hear me or even cares. Which makes me spiral and be like ""why am I trying so hard?"", ""Why won't they hear me?"", ""Do I not matter"", ""I must not matter..."". I feel like I am silencing myself because why should I use my voice if no one cares. Am struggling to remind myself that I do matter and that someone out there will hear me. When I try to problem solve and be like ""hey, just call someone and reach out"", I just stall out. It's like every part of myself can't press the call button. Why? I know it would help but I don't want to bother people, I don't want to be a burden and I know that I can get through it alone. That is what I t

He said he could build me one instead. From the age I was 7 to 15, every year he said he would. I gave up asking at 15. I asked him for multiple things like that. I realized it was an issue for him when I asked to open up my first bank account at 19 and he kept saying ""not now"". I asked for two years. For help really. Then I said I was going to the bank on my own, and that's when he said ok. I think I'm gonna have to be comfortable with the fact that he may not work on his will either, ever. I've been asking him every 6 months to since he had that stroke back in 2012. All he ever says is ""yes I'm going to do that soon."" Its not gonna happen I dont think. I'm trying to be ok with that but I'm in the beginning stages. He owns so much property and multiple cars, of which many are rare or antique/vintage. Plus musical 
instruments he he has including a very expensive and rare guitar and his first guitar from the early 50s. Anyway...very saddening.

It costs like 15 dollars. My dad says I'm wasting money doing that, and should just buy everything separately cuz itll be cheaper. But I've done that, and it came out like complete crap. We ended up buying the wrong type of meat, cuz I know nothing about meat. It was just awful. This specific kit turns out amazing. And it comes with prepackaged spices to throw in.

175960112,"Hi _PERSON_: Yes for sure, our minds can sometimes manufacture symptoms for something, that is not there. I remember when my Daughter was 5 and in senior kindergarten. Some kid brought head lice to school and spread it around. I cut my D's long hair(one reason kids get lice faster), washed everything in the house and the dog of course and put unwashable items in garbage bags. Plus of course, checked for lice in everyone's hair with the comb. I put the goop in our D's hair, to kill any lice. It played in my mind and days later, I got the feeling of lice in my hair. Then one night, around midnight, I cut my hair real short. LOL! You probably do not have the flu, particularly the Coronavirus. If it makes you feel better, as mentioned, see your Dr. or go to a walk-in-clinic. Other things you can do if you want to: *Get a flu shot *Wash your hands frequently *Try not to touch your nose, mouth or eyes before washing your hands, if you have been out *Check your temperature morning and evening to catch a f
ever and to make yourself feel better *Stock up on whatever you need especially: medical items like cough syrup, Tylenol, etc. possibly on Amazon, if you don't want to go out *Orange juice wouldn't hurt *Get lots of rest *Stay out of crowded areas, unless you go to work or need to purchase items. Choose times when less people go. *Ask your s/o to stay a good distance from anyone who shows symptoms or areas they know they have touched *Dress appropriately for outside, if you must go out *Cough and sneeze into your elbow and mention it to others who have forgotten *If you go out, wear gloves when opening doors, pushing a cart, etc., touching buttons on elevators, etc. * Wearing a N95 mask is helpful but a Dr. on the news said that it is not necessary unless the person already has the flu. I think that is ridiculous! People with autoimmune diseases and the elderly, are trying their best not to get sick. So anything that they can do to protect themselves should be encouraged. The hospitals are overfull, as is. Th

I cn only come to the conclusion that people know of my past account on there, and or this one too. If that's the case, then all is lost and I come in here to yell at the void and it has been noticed and noted. I've said some crazy things on here, and I've vented about people too, and my situations. I feel paralyzed in thought."

I know many women how had breast cancer, caught early and they are all fine, still here. I've heard most (maybe all) who have had breast cancer say pain is not a symptom. I understand your health fears. I struggle with that too."

My husband takes 10mg of melatonin but the trick is to take it about 6:00 pm and go to bed about 10:00, not everybody realizes that. I still do meditation but it hasn't been working as well. I have too much going on in my mind which isn't good. I also find if I am on my phone (playing a game or something) before bed that I can't sleep. It must be stimulating to the brain and effects shutting down. So I am trying not to do that for a couple hours before bed time. I hope you start getting sleep. It is miserable without it.

I've seen it, I've heard it, I've felt it, even if for a fleeting moment today. Just before my first divorce to my wife, I was forced by her to sell our apartment at a substantial loss...but that is all water under the bridge already... Wow...very poignant words written by your wife... : _ / It seems to me that even though your marriage was sometimes on the rocks, you still loved her deep down. My job is fine; it has been stable and general
ly or somewhat lucrative for the past decade...I'm a saver and my wife is a spender, so I guess we complement each other. Lol sorry bad joke. But thanks for asking...are you still working too?"

I am obsessed with astronomy and belief that the answers to these age old questions shall come from outer space. I also want to send a few of my things into outer space. Maybe a hankerchief with my blood stains, maybe my art or an analysis of what the world meant to me.....put them in a capsule and ask a space faring agency to send it. Why? Because the Universe must know that I existed. It should know that I rishi, born in the year 1984, on Earth experienced what I did.

I had a good reason, my Mom's birthday is tomorrow so I said we were celebrating this weekend. In all actuality, I didn't want to go. I don't feel up to socializing. But then she invited me for next Friday and I couldn't think of how to get out of that one, so I'm going. I don't feel up to anything. I so wanted to call in today. And then we had a really long board meeting, like an hour almost. They are supposed to be 5 to 10 minutes every morning. So that sucked the life out of me. My depression has been bad and the desire to SH has been strong and I just feel like I don't have the emotional resources to deal with it. But the hallucinations have been really good lately. Hardly had any. I got up this morning at 5 and then just laid in the lazy boy until 6:30 when I was like, I really have to get ready for work. My lack of motivation has been getting to me. I was reading a book last night that Pastor _PERS
ON_ wanted me to read, I read two chapters. But I have to read it again because I don't feel like I comprehended it. That's been happening to me a lot lately. Where I just don't get stuff. I'm like stupid or something. Even with the Vyvanse dosage raised. I have zero motivation today. Really not good. HUGS all, _PERSON_"

175960158,So my mom offered to buy us groceries. She said it was coming on the 2nd which is a Thursday. She said I HAVE to be home. I said well you know I work on thursdays. I can’t just take time off to be at home for a delivery. I can’t do that. I have a contract with this company to work when they need me. I said “i wish u would’ve asked me about a certain date beforehand”. And she goes “EXCUSE ME...I’m trying to help you”. So I got off the phone. I texted to her to not offer me help if it’s gonna be like this.
175960159,"new story is now 13 pages long now. I have a rough ending for it that kept on changing. I wrote 2 endings, and think I'll go with the slightly more positive one. By the time I end the story, and format it the right way it will probably be about 40 pages long. My first book was more about education, and I made just about every mistake an amateur writer can make, including not knowing my limits. I think all the quotes were overwhelming too. Story kind of came second where education was first. Still, it was my first book and I completed it, even though I released it in May and wasn't finished until October... I'm questioning whether I should even complete Part II that concludes the story... This short story hardly took any effort at all, it all just naturally springs from my mind. I think I will publish this short story for as cheap of a price as possible, costing nothing if possible. Can I release it on Kindle for free? In book format I will sell it as cheaply as possible, I think that's is for $5 bu
cks. I will also publish it on my blog. I think this is more poignant than the other, and I just want people to give it a chance. I think this one may be harder to put down."

175960189,"vkj said... they said ugly things and shut me off like they never knew me smile ...i really don't know how people do that? In the case of my ex-fiancee, I'm pretty sure it's because she feels guilty about how she dumped me for someone else. And perhaps stupid, because that didn't work out so well after she married him.... In another case, my mother, well, some people are sufficiently ""evil"" they can do just that, you can for example read up on a variety of personality disorders and see if any of them match those people. Which will forewarn yourself when you start to make new acquaintances in the future. I feel for where you're at, it's something like where I've ended up. Getting at peace with myself was a very big step, it helps a lot in making the loneliness tolerable.

My family needs me, and they keep me from giving into the bad in my mind. I know that without my husband I would not make it threw the hardest days.i have begun painting, crafting, walking, and doing everything I can to maintain until I can find a doctor that will listen and try to help me threw this. I am very proud of you for speaking out, making a doctor's appointment, and looking for ways to cope. Sister we have not made it this far and survived our pasts so that we can give up. No, We will fight. Coming here to speak up show

I made myself take a shower and everything. The whole enchilada. But I totally didn't want to come in after having those two days off and then the next two days off. Had a good talk with the owner though, well, via Skype. Told her I wasn't feeling well (she asked). She is pretty good with stuff like that. I feel comfortable talking to her. I refrained from telling her I was feeling self destructive. I just said I was not feeling well. She asked a few questions like if I was sleeping? When I see my doctor? Stuff like that."

175960215,"My sister got her COVID vaccine last week at work. I’m doing well, just got into a kind of funk for the past 2 days, and sleeping a lot , but I think it is just PMS because it’s that time frame so it’s normal for me. But I did my yoga and exercises today, and swept and mopped the kitchen. I listened to a podcast while I did that. That’s gonna make cleaning a whole lot easier now that I’ve got wireless earphones and a phone with much better battery life. I can just put on a podcast while I’m cleaning and it will go by much faster, I’ll be inclined to do it more often. I’ve been meditating again lately. I’m currently doing a facing fear meditation plan with the Balance app. I wanted to get over my fear of taking pills so I’m working on that. I did talk to my pharmacist and a few of the meds I’m on (not the small ones but the big ones, the ones that are hard for me to swallow) , they can be crushed and taken with food. I don’t have a pill crusher but I’m getting one soon. So 
that will help too. I have some steaks in my freezer I’m wanting to cook soon. Those will be good. I can’t remember the last time I had steak. It’s actually been years, which is weird because I really enjoy it. I’m planning on baking some cookies for my sister next month. I’m not sure what kind yet. Either regular chocolate chip or chocolate cookies with chocolate chips. Oh and, I’m getting a blender so I get to experiment with different kinds of fruit/vegetable smoothies. Mostly fruit, with some spinach thrown in. And I saw mangoes at the grocery store last time I was there! I never seen them there before because I never looked in the organic section but last time I was in that section for some reason and I saw them. I like just eating those fresh. They’re so good, one of my favorite fruits."

175960217,Congrats!!
175960218,"I stayed up all night. It has been the most transformative experience in a long time. I woke up yesterday morning feeling agitated and horribly mentally confused. My brain was completely scrambled because I was holding onto EVERYTHING. I was only thinking letters to stories in comparison of thoughts to my whole ego. I went for a walk, listening to music and felt incredibly euphoric and then I would walk back inside, feeling irritated. I decided to play piano and the cats were meowing and people were talking and moving around so I stopped playing. My mom and her friends were sitting outside on the front porch and it was sunny and warm for spring. I was talking to them while there was complete chaos in the back of my mind. As the sun went down, I went into my room and took a mixture of chemicals. I then cried for an hour - My dad texted me about his money, stocks, what's going to happen in the world etc.. I just didn't want to deal with it so I told him about what happened - I pasted what I wrote yes
terday. I then started feeling much better and happy because I released all of my pain into crying. I then felt euphoric, talked to trippers online, smoked weed 3 times and every time I smoked, I wrote deep philosophical things and enjoyed the sadness accompanied by a pleasant euphoria each time it wore off. I started looking at _NAME_ quotes and I realize that I'm finally living in the moment - In this current moment, thinking about nothing. Nothing at all. This experience has been just as good as a psychedelic trip."
175960219,I literally want to hide from Facebook though. I really don't want to get on for whatever reason. Probably cause I posted a blog and feel self-conscious about it.

175960228,That is really not accurate. It depends on circumstances. A lot of people would disagree and say therapy with medication is a waste of money. Circumstance is the link and what works is what works. I been on both sides of the fence and both with and without.

175960230,"We went to steak and shake, it was a fiasco....apparently they don’t make the taco salads anymore....so not a great start. We get around to the drive through and pay then they tell us to park in number three. We were expecting to get our food through the drive through as usual. So we park in number three. We notice the guy bringing food to everyone has his mask below his nose which is totally ineffective. So the bf decides we’ve gotta wear masks and just have him set it on the hood and walk away. It was the wrong order...sigh so he had to trade bags with the guy. Never again."

175960232,Happy Birthday Job! Hope you are having a fun day!
175960233,"Hi Hunter, I’m 23 and am a lot like you. I’ve struggled with crippling anxiety most of my life and a couple of times, most severely when I was 20, have gone multiple days without sleeping and had a continuous resting heart rate over over 100 BPM. After about 5 days of suffering like that I was terrified I’d die and went to the doctor. I was prescribed medication to help me get rest, and I told the doctor I was scared I’m developing heart issues. He reassured me that as a physically healthy, young person your heart will be okay. You’re having panic attacks and the symptoms are similar so it’s hard to tell"

Meant to go on Duolingo and work on my Italian but my internet was acting weird, I'll probably do that now. Sketched a picture of one of my cats, very basic, not good but it's a start, I have never tried to draw an animal in person before, I got a book recently on the fundamentals on drawing animals, showing movement, and basics on their anatomy Gotta vacuum tomorrow"

175960239,"I took the cat outside and as I stared out into the nothingness, I felt the wind blowing - I was focused. ""The 5mg Dexedrine has kicked in"" I said to myself. A little panic came over me - ""Are you ok?"" said my sister. I think to myself, ""Am I ok? - I'm in a new consciousness now.. Should I take benzo?"" - No.. don't take benzo... Everything is the way that it should be.. Meditation is wayyyy more difficult without ADHD meds. It's EXTREMELY difficult. I never knew how difficult it was until I did it before bed when they have worn off. But it seems effortless with the stimulant. I wonder if I meditate at moderate doses, my focus would get better - That's honestly what I believe. Because what monk has ADHD? _PERSON_."
175960240,I haven’t left the house in about a week. I feel people are watching me. But I have to leave the house tomorrow. Going to pick up food for dinner. And then I have to go to the bank on Friday. It’s stupid but I feel nervous about it. People will see me. Watching me.

175960256,"Yes..i probably need a more long term medication. Youre right, this tripnhas brought this all to light.....Im really considering my options... If Ive been taking Ativan and medications like this on and off especially during stressful times should i see a dr to taper. Ive never taken more then my prescribed amount...which is very low. Ive heard seizures only happen with people who take high doses for long periods of time. My old Psych dr gave me them and ever tapered me..so maybe he wasnt worried...but ive started taking them again and so I would need a new Dr. My Psych dr right now is online so she wouldnt be able to taper me if you think thats a good idea"

I have to show her proof of a letter every 6 months from my therapist to let her know I'm still seeing somebody in that I still have panic and anxiety disorder you may want to try going that route if possible good luck and keep us posted
175960259,"Went to Value Village and found some old textbooks. Sociology, physics, and this weird one about 'new science' including a lot of technical **** for computing. Looks interesting af. My sister and I are a couple of nerds. I want to learn EVERYTHING. There was an economics textbook but it was from 1999 and I figure some of it is a little out of date so I didn't get it. I have a plan that I'm going to try to finish my third assignment for my course this weekend. Then I can register for the exam and do it in early April. So my plan is for the rest of April to take some time to relax, do some LinkedIn learning, crocheting, etc. Start fresh new courses in May. Calculus and Java."
175960260,I am currently on meds. I went off my meds when I was pregnant but went on it again after he was born. I’m on 3 different kinds of meds now. I see a psychiatrist and it’s only talk therapy. I started getting panic attacks when my husband left the country and I had to take care of our son alone. So the psychiatrist gave me clonazepam. But when I run out of it I use cannabis oil. The psychiatrist doesn’t wanna give me too much clonazepam cause I have a history of addiction. Sometimes I will have alcohol when i can’t get cannabis oil. I am seeing my psychiatrist today so maybe he will adjust my meds again. I also feel like the cannabis oil and alcohol is not helping my symptoms at all.
175960261,"I had a really rough night. I spent half of it convinced I was dying. And I was having auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, a severe panic attack and visual disturbances"
175960262,Oh how I wish it would storm. It’s supposed to tomorrow and then cool off next week. I went outside to pick from the garden and made it about 1/2 way down the yard and decided it was way too hot. Veggies will still be there Monday I tried taking a nap but it wasn’t happening. Waiting for my pizza now.
175960263,I’m going to try to be positive
175960264,.
175960265,"Thank you for the nice comments. She may not be bipolar. As someone who is that, and I’m not a doctor but I’ve seen different disorders, for bipolar she needs racing mind, gets hooked on one wonderful idea and manics on that. Goes into buying sprees, sleep problems, then has depression, and back and forth between can’t do enough to can’t do anything. Does she have that? I’ve also seen borderline personality syndrome, my now deceased wife had that, and I’ve read a lot about it. And you said your wife had trauma. Do you know if she was sexually abused? Is she a sexually active type person? This rage thing doesn’t sound bipolar, but sounds to an amateur like borderline. I went to borderline personality syndrome on the search engine, which you may want to also, and psycom.net had a quiz which either the subject or someone close to that person could take. Here are some of the questions: 1. My relationships are very intense, unstable, and alternate between the extremes of over idealizing an
d undervaluing people who are important to me. (True or False) 2. My emotions change very quickly, and I experience intense episodes of sadness, irritability, and anxiety or panic attacks. 3. My level of anger is often inappropriate, intense, and difficult to control. 4. Now, or in the past, when upset, I have engaged in recurrent suicidal behaviors, gestures, threats, or self-injurious behavior such as cutting, burning, or hitting myself. There are more questions on psycom.net, which I found by typing in borderline personality syndrome and it was on my search in the top five listings. Those above questions seem to me as an amateur to hit real close to what your friend has. What do you think? You need the right diagnosis for them to give the right medicine. If they keep medicating for bipolar, and it’s not, the medicine won’t help. On the other hand, I’ve heard that borderline is hard to medicate. You said, “She does self medicates with marijuana consistently, and that helps most of the time, but she 
has so many co-morbid conditions - PTSD, sexual assault from the past, anxiety, agoraphobia, seizures, etc - that Marijuana isn't enough sometimes.” You also said, “We took her to an in patient program at one point. She spent a week at a facility. But for the last few years I haven't had consistent insurance coverage for mental health coverage, and we can't afford to send her to the doctors she needs all the time. Right now I have no coverage at all - not even counselor. She has prescript ions that we pay for with cash (thank god we have a friend who works at a pharmacy!) but being bipolar, she doesn't take them regularly.” There are free mental health clinics. You can look on the net search engine for “Mental Health Clinics for My Hometown” and maybe pick the one closet to you. Let us know how this is going."
175960266,"I blocked the ""friend"" that keeps asking me for money. I don't even have my own money. Now he's going to tell another acquaintance which is bs. This all starts cuz I'm too nice and can't say no. Both of these people are very morally opinionated and right now I'm quite horrified."
175960267,Gonna go skiing tomorrow. I'll keep taking a fish oil pill every day even though I'm afraid that it causes heart palpitations - Could be all in my head. I'm highly exhausted from poor executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment. I saw on the news that psilocybin mushrooms are going to become used for medicinal purposes here in Canada. I saw a cryptocurrency advertisement and also the government is thinking of decriminalizing drugs to help fight the opioid pandemic - I was right about all of these things!! Not sure if I can sleep but I'll try..
175960268,"My aunt and my mom don't get along when it comes to parenting and kids growing up. I love them both to death. However sometimes it's hard not to side with one or the other. Yeah, I'm not perfect. but neither were they and they should understand that. you see the problem is only my aunt understands how I feel about certain things that my mom would never understand. That doesn't mean I hate my mom or dislike my mom any less. It just means that if I need someone to talk to I have my aunt. the problem is if I talk to her about something and it builds up inside me about how I feel who do I talk to next? I need someone to talk to, but only for them to listen and not give me advice or tell me that I'm wrong or right on certain things, but just to listen. would you listen? you probably don't care what I have to say. you probably don't care why I decided to come on here and see if any of you could just listen. I can tell you a little bit about myself and where my family comes from but I don't know much. So, 
if you care enough to listen, let me know."
175960269,"What I've found through personal experience is that some people just aren't meant to be in intimate relationships (or at least I am not). For them, the thought of intimacy may be appealing sometimes, but it's like something that smells good but actually tastes bad and gives you diarrhea. There are other sources to get sustenance from. The part about not being able to relate to people in general though, yeah, that's a hindrance. True isolation isn't feasible or pleasant. About inner representations and all, I don't think that's limited to people. Reality is a shared illusion. And it often turns out to not be shared."
174348470,I'm having a little difficulty this morning. Maybe some more reading of _NAME_ book will help.

175960280,"I talked to the RN that oversees my care yesterday afternoon. She wants me to think about IOP if she can find one that works with my work schedule. I can probably ask for an accommodation in my working hours or something. But I have to be able to work, I got bills! She thinks that Pastor _PERSON_ might be stressing me out too much and she isn't sure I should see him. Several people on PC have said the same thing. I don't know if I am ready to quit seeing him. Maybe I need to see all this stuff as a spiritual issue. Maybe then I will be healed. I gotta believe though--and I think I'm skeptical deep down. She said some of the stuff he says to me would be hurtful to her if he said it to her. That made me pause. She wants to know if I would go to a _USER_ID_ support group. There is one in my area that meets the second and fourth Thursdays. I'm kind of anxious and scared about trying it, but I guess if I don't like it, I don't have to go back. The RN also wants to talk to my T but so far my T isn't talk
ing to her so she had me sign some form that says she can talk to her. Well the RN can talk to the T I don't know if the T can talk to the RN. I don't really understand that part of it. And she wants me to find a gym. Sheesh. So much stuff. And she is going to call me next week since I was IP last week."
174348487,"Sorry to hear about your issues. I have also been diagnosed as Schizoaffective. I hear voices, but in a kind of way where I would walk by someone or a group of people and ""hear"" their conversations and they are always menacing. I have the idea sometimes that the tv is sending me signals, or that I can control what happens, say in a sporting event. Also I have the horrible issue where people can put thoughts in my head. No physical sensations, but a lot of paranoia and huge delusions of grandeur. I was actually happy to hear my diagnosis because it meant there was something amiss and I could do something about it. I still have relapses and the illness pops it's head out with little symptoms here and there. I am pretty much stable and have been for about 5 years."
174348488,"Yeah, I here ya. But I though I would ask, anyway."
175960281,"Might as well take 75mg seroquel, melatonin and sleep. I took an atenolol and washed it down with a beer otherwise my heart goes beatbeatbeatbeat fastfastfastfast... But I had a really good birthday! Chilled, had hamburgers and a nice cake. My moms bf was obsessive and jealous that my moms friend was here (Sweet lady with bipolar that was already distancing herself from my mom because my moms bf wants my mom all to herself). I think he just wants sex. He's stupid but has a lot of common sense. I'm intelligent and have no common sense. So now my mom can't sleep cuz she's thinking about it and she has cancer. It's not fair to her that her bf is being so selfish. Took 3 drags of a doobie today. Nice sunny day then it rained which is nice. I like rain. I will try to wake up early tomorrow maybe. Take a Vyvanse (The only thing that allows me to function). Good night preciouses <3"
175960282,I had to make coffee this morning too...I was totally craving it too late yesterday afternoon. I normally have it only on weekends because it messes with my anxiety if I drink it too often.
175960283,I feel empty. Sigh. Now I can’t stop thinking about calories and don’t want to eat.
175960284,"Might go to sleep at 3am tonight and try to wake up at 10am. Gonna take an olanzepine and zopiclone. I haven't took an alprazolam, diazepam or temazepam (Benzos) in almost 4 days! My doctor was smart to only prescribe 5 temazepam cuz if he prescribed more, I would have used one every night. But I have 3 left. My doctor says that he knows me well over the past 2 years - Lets me be in control slightly. He knows what he's doing personally with me it seems. I'm gonna take another walk around the block and listen to songs before I sleep. The peak of madness, confusion and messiness is subsiding - I'm turning my sleep schedule back to normal."
175960285,Black coffee (again)
175960286,Cheers guys. HT. Sad love my place but not this area....and it is due for the turtle to have some peace. HT
175960287,"Thanks. Yeah, this is a trying time for me. But I will persevere through it. I’m not sure how to approach my mom to let her know how long I will be here. I hope that I get what I need to stay out of hospital this time..."

I'm paranoid about other peoples intentions. I feel like I'm in a simulation. Work is over now. Working makes me think deeply about my past and there's always a song stuck in my head and it can be like that for like an hour. I keep thinking about things and it's torturous. My own mind torments me badly. I was ok this morning - Feeling great. Hopefully I'll feel better once I'm finished chores and such and can relax.
175960291,Keep strong u lot. HT
175960292,"Possible trigger: On another note, I bought a bottle of wine 2-3 days ago and drank some and I was really social. It was like phenibut kinda. I like alcohol again I suppose but I'm also able to just drink whenever I want cuz I didn't like it anymore before I'm gonna bring my books with me on the trip to the city."

I drank it when I was 17-18 and I found ""The meaning to the universe"" as I called it for the first time. I must have lost billions of IQ points. Make sure you're not on any SSRI cuz both together can cause serotonin syndrome. Sizzurp (Lean) is a better choice. Codeine/promethazine cough syrup. I don't recommend that either!!

175960294,I should've just rented the ebook of the book I got today but I was embarrassed if I hadn't checked out the book after the lady pulled it out and brought it to me.
175960295,"Hey _NAME_. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, MDD and a few other things stemming from this lovely group. In general to your questions, I know that there is help and stuff out there for me. However, being able to find help can be difficult, access can be hard since we live in a rural area and costs can be crazy even with good insurance. I only discovered this site by accident a little while ago and that was just a happy accident when I was searching for a crisis hotline. Any help that I get is usually limited to what my providers are willing to refer me to for insurance purposes. In terms of access to help, it really depends on what you need. I can easily find a therapist, but when I say that it means that I get a list of names and its a random draw until you find the right fit. I didn't have a consistent person managing my medication until I got pregnant with my first son. That was when I met a Dr who I trusted and who has helped me for the last 3 or so years. I had been suffering for 
a lot longer before then and just didn't know what to do. Being passed around from person to person makes you give up on yourself pretty quickly. I have been having a really hard time since I got pregnant with my second son. He is about to be 9 months old and am still flirting the line between being admitted and being able to stay at home safely. This is where cost really comes into play. Now I not only have to worry about my health and staying home, but the cost (especially since covid) is crazy with a lot of options. This limits me to what I can afford and it's not much. I already spend a lot on therapy visits and Dr appointments, so the added cost of being admitted or extra sessions etc. can be crippling. Money matters more than life in the healthcare systems eyes. I think that it is even more true when talking about mental health. Sometimes Drs can see it as something that we are doing to ourselves. You can see that you have to save someone's life if they need emergency surgery or if there is something th
ere that you can physically see. When it is someone in front of you asking for help with something that they can't see it's harder. It makes it harder for me personally to ask for help. It's hard to ask someone for help with something you can't really find the words to explain, but that you know is slowly building and killing you. I got more if you need more lol. I'm happy to try to explain anything that I have said to clarify for you. If I don't respond on the thread just PM me. I am an open book about myself. My children are off limits."
175960296,"I'm worried about my friend, he didn't say anything to me today. This morning, the nurse said we're confined to our rooms for another 14 days. No vaping, no exercise, nothing. I have just one disposable left. I hate this."
175960297,Donut Friday at work. I had a glazed donut. Am drinking plain black iced tea unsweetened.
175960298,"Had Oatmeal, a banana, and a glass of milk for breakfast."
175960299,"I will def reply to let you know what my doctor thinks. I’ve held off on taking Effexor until I see him. At this point I’m not too sure whether I need to be on an AD. For the most part I feel fine, it’s mostly in the a.m. that I feel a bit anxious on edge and have a hard time focusing. Which that is a big problem of mine. I focus too much on the anxiety and make it worse. I myself make my anxiety worse. I’m going through a separation so that alone is what triggered my anxiety. I have my moments of feeling depressed but of course these are all part of the process of separating. I am so grateful to have found this site years ago when I first started Lexapro. It really did help tremendously to talk to people who understand. Thank you all! Hope you’ve had a great weekend"
175960300,"Hi , It’s been a long time since I checked in , nothing to say but I’m trying to do my best now and and praying and trying to live with less fear . A wonderful prayer I can suggest to all is the Abundance Prayer , which you can easily find online . Another thing I just thought of to contribute is I had something very important to talk of - kind of a interview over the phone , normally not any problem . Anyways , I had thought too much of this particular topic and when it came to speak I could barely put the words out and explain my version of things . My point here is not to brew about things too much , keep it in perspective and leave it . That was a isolated thing . Have been fine since , speaking is a strong suit . Hi Scaredy Cat."

175960304,What do U have? Wanna play something together?
175960305,"I kinda have something to say about fiance and people like him, like my exes and other people out there. _PERSON_ spends all his free time playing video games and smoking pot. That's his deal. But he also doesnt spend a lot of time with me. He pouts if he has to lay with me and talk for even 5 minutes. Let alone 20 or 30 min. I offered to sit on the couch with him and talk last night (as I have many times) but he just wants to play video games. I cant even get him to goto the store with me let alone a trip. Whether it be to dallas or idk somewhere else much further. That's not really what I'm wanting to talk about. But, the fact that all he does before and after work, which is play video games and smoke. I just thought about this. Hes basically living a mindless and numb life. The video games are mindless and the pot is numbing. Now yes video games are mindless and it's cool if people out there play them from time to time. Maybe even a couple hours a day, but he play from morning til night. Or on h
is work days, morning and then night. With all that above, it ties in because he seems like he doesnt care to experience the world in any way. He doesnt read, travel much, or meet new people, etc. Its akin to having junk food every day. Its empty calories and unhealthy. A little junk food is fine but not 24/7 right? Well it's like video games. A little is fine but not 24/7. And it's like something healthy, like a healthy hobby, would be like my sisters husband. He does marathons. Not only is he getting fit, but he sees new places wherever he does a marathon, and he meets tons of people. Its hobbies like that that I myself strive for. Not necessarily marathoning.

175960307,"Hi there, my name is _NAME_ and I'd like to share a bit about my experience. Keep in mind that I have never been for a prolonged psychiatric hospital stay, only just a temporary one when I crashed my car drunk a year and a half ago. I recognized immediately that the only people being released were the ones praying and pretending like they were happy. (more on that later) Being outside of the psychiatric system this whole time has enabled me to see things in a somewhat different light than those of us who have had the misfortune (or fortune, depending on how you look at it) of being told how you must think about your condition. Anyways, on to my crazy story. A little over 3 years ago I was sitting in my car smoking meth amphetamine and watching pornography when I started to hear the first voices. They sounded like voices coming from the yard next to where I was parked, so I didn't bother too much with them. As I progressively got worse, stopped conversing with people in real life, and continued to d
o drugs and watch pornography, the voices became louder and a strong delusion began to present itself. I was led to believe that there was an elite group of hackers that wanted to put me through some tests to see if I could join their hacker group. Being on drugs 24 hours of the day and sometimes staying up 5 nights in a row, for whatever reason in my warped mind at the time, I thought this was actually a good idea, cause I mean damn who doesn't want to be a part of an elite hacker group, right? In hindsight it seems incredibly silly considering I didn't know the first thing about computer security or programming, as all I have is some 4 credits from a failed computer science degree. Anyways, I went along with this delusion for several weeks, messing about with my computer and trying to follow a series of tasks, which always ended up with me confused and completely insane. At one point I was disassembling my laptop computer piece by piece looking for a rogue audio recording device attached to the motherboard, 
(which I found btw just to add to the craziness). While this delusion was going on, I wasn't even concerned with the fact that I was hearing these voices, I was convinced that they were elite hackers so they must have some way of communicating through my devices. Next thing that happened was the voices started to make it clear that they weren't happy that I wasn't able to prove to them that I had hacking skill, so I started to have anxiety over it. I started to think thoughts that they would try and kill me because I couldn't prove to them that I could hack and that they were extremely mad at me for wasting their time. Once I started to feel this fear, the voices began to prey upon it. This seems to be a common theme among others I speak to that have the same condition, they are fearful and the voices prey upon their fears. The voices started telling me things like if I couldn't show them that I could hack that they would have to clean up the situation, and dispose of me. This is when I started feeling like I 
was being stalked by a gang, weird black cars would pull up in front of my mothers house where I was staying, and people full of tattoos would routinely get out of the car, poke around, and then get back into the car and drive away at high speeds. Weird stuff. This went on for several weeks time until I had this like breaking point delusion. I somehow got it into my head that because I was 30 that maybe I was Jesus. Maybe that is why all of this seemingly mystical stuff was happening around me (voices, random objects appearing, moving, etc). This delusion drove me completely out of my mind, and I started believing that my own mother was the devil because her tongue was moving around all crazy and she started to say weird things to me like prophecies about when Jesus would come back, but not in her voice but this deep evil sounding voice. This seemed so completely out of character for her because 1- She is a chaplain, and she knows full well that the bible teaches that no one knows the second coming of Jesus b
ut the Father, so her saying these things to me seemed like she was not herself. It got to the point where I was running around my house with a knife and didn't have any clue as to what was going on. That's it for part one, writing this out is actually kind of therapeutic :P I'll be posting more parts as I go here."

175960312,"I slept all day. Can't take a Vyvanse at night so I'm extremely tired and slow. My moms friend with bipolar/borderline PD came over to bring food. She judged me for staying up all night and made me feel bad. Said ""Just go skiing and be fun"" eventually after saying that I might. I should have told her that I don't feel good but I don't want them to know about withdrawal from phenibut. My sister was doing the same thing.. Harassing me saying ""What do you do all night on the computer?"" I hate when people ask me questions like that.. Well, I was sending trip reports to my friends, listening to music and helping pharmacology students find research papers for clobenzorex, facebook, snapchat, YouTube, forums, etc.. What's the point of telling people what I do when when I list what I did, they interrupt me in the middle of listing everything? What the **** social fish ****ery is that? Then when I was going back to bed, she said ""Oh so you're gonna let your sister clean up after you?"". What a *****. I 
said to my sister last night that I would clean the dishes in the morning and she said that she likes to do them.. This is what happens in phenibut withdrawal.. I don't have the confidence to defend myself in real life because I can't organize my speech and everyone harasses me. It pisses me off. If people could just accept that I'm in a low mood, they wouldn't be such terrible people. I should have told her I'm not feeling well but then she'd be like ""Why?"". **** sake."

I notice (Like Newtus) that CBD makes me feel high in a way but without the paranoia and anxiety. That's why I don't take it all the time. I wish it was slightly addictive so I could.

I once had a stress ball as well but it never really took hold for me in terms of a habit. Something like that might help though."

You're supposed to drink lots of water on topamax anyways to prevent kidney stones from it since it increases your chances of getting them. So the topamax I've been on for a month now.

My thoughts are destructive, I become completely paranoid and I delude myself in many different ways. I also talk to myself as if I'm standing outside my own head looking in. When this happens it calms me down. I call him the voice of reason and he makes me see how things ""actually"" are.

175960358,Thanks _NAME_. Well I told her tonight how I felt and I feel like I just pushed her away. She said she only used the dating app once just to talk to someone the night I took our kid out of the house and stayed at a friends house. Now I feel like I just pushed her away or at least that’s how she made me feel. She said. “ I don’t think this will work.” I feel like I should leave but she has a point about not just leaving the kids. I hate telling her all these things cause it just justifies all the negative shit about me that’s in her head already. I don’t know. I’m a mess.

175960380,"...or rather DON'T watch them! I was watching an emotional movie today that triggered a panic attack for me. I never have random panic attacks anymore so this was a definite connection between what I was watching and my anxiety. The movie was not scary or overtly violent (implied but not shown), but was very dark and about abuse. I should have known better, but it just sort of sucked me in. It was a very well done movie...just not one that I should be watching. I immediately recognized what and why I started to feel horrible and was able to use my skills and put out the panic flare...fairly quickly. ..but my point is, we can easily avoid such triggers from the input of media we choose (or don't) Everyone's buttons are different. For you it could be sad/violent/scary subject matter...or even just the news. You have to recognize what sets you over the edge personally. Just a friendly reminder from my mistake, lol! S.C."

175960418,"The last time I took two Ativan was before I wound up at this place, it was a day that I had to go to the clinic so my friend was with me. We were coming back upstairs on the stairs I am phobic of, and I must have been feeling dizzy or vertigo because I said I have to sit down. So I changed direction on the stairs without even thinking about it and sat down. There was my friend and I, and neighbors all on the stairs. I don't know how long I sat there but we eventually finished going upstairs. I don't think I'll take another one tonight. I actually feel better now, I don't have those feelings of being trapped and isolated. I'm so sad for poor _PERSON_ the cat. His parents just rescued a 10 year old _PERSON_ from some circus or something and _PERSON_ has never had to share the parents (except for _NAME_, their jealous and depressed sphynx). But now I think today, he smelled the cheetah on his mom and wouldn't go for a walk with her. I am praying that his Dad will still make him feel like his favorite
. I don't want him to feel unhappy or rejected. I went to 3 vape breaks today (I think). My tank didn't leak! The gods of vaping took pity on me. I get coughing attacks once I'm back in my room but it's ok now that I can get a menthol lozenge."
175960419,"I tried SSRIs (antidepressants) a few years ago, but it really only helped me from hitting the worst of my depression. But it also made me very sleepy and lethargic, and my foggy focus got even worse. Depression already makes those things hard for me, so I want a medication that would help with that, not make it worse. Since I only have suicidal ideation extremely rarely, the medication I was on seemed to be doing more bad than good for me. My main problems are day-to-day struggles like vague sadness for no reason, trouble enjoying my hobbies and favorite foods, trouble focusing, trouble sleeping. When I asked my doctor, she said that kind of antidepressant I was taking should actually have been giving me more focus and more energy, and she didn’t know what else to prescribe for me. I left feeling frustrated, but at that time I wasn’t able to find another doctor. This year I was able to get healthcare again, so I hope that i can start seeing a more knowledgeable specialist. So i wanted to ask t
he group if they’ve had these experiences with SSRI, and what should I really stress to my doctor to explain how I am feeling? Sometimes when I talk to a doctor I feel like they don’t believe me, they think I am being overly dramatic, or they think I am just trying to get drugs. Any suggestions or wisdom to share?"

This is a natural process when reading and helps to reduce cognitive load, and it helps the mind to access meanings to enable it to comprehend and remember what is read.Although some people associate subvocalization with moving one's lips, the actual term refers primarily to the movement of muscles associated with speaking, not the literal moving of lips.

175960432,"HI _PERSON_, It sure has helped me, though brand name is the best if you can get it. I was on brand name for two years and my prescription plan changed and now I get generic which isn't as good but still helps. There are a few generics and I find the brand ""activist _NAME_"" isn't as good. But it does help. I get it though my psychiatrist and now my psychologist who can now prescribe it. Ritalin is another good stimulant if you can't get Adderall. There was a shortage on Adderall in 2012 so I switched to the extended release. So I take one capsule for the whole day instead of two pills. The pills last about 4 hours where the capsules last 12. The nice thing about the pills is if you feel well enough, you can cut them in half and take less if need be. The capsules take longer to kick in. The capsules are also used for adhd. I hope you can get some. I tried everything before hand. But found Adderall to work the best. Best wishes, Hugs, _NAME_..."
175960433,"I'm still anxious today but it's less, I think, than yesterday. I'll probably take Xanax in a bit. I want to get ahead of the anxiety instead of trying to fight it once it is full blown. I did take a walk last night with my Dad which was nice. The weather was good, a little breezy. It's been hot here so we either have to go early or late to not be in the heat so much. Might try to go again tonight if it isn't too hot. It's supposed to be hotter today than yesterday. I think walking is good for my anxiety. And just good in general."
175960434,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. I texted my friend back and said I didn't think it was the weather but I explained some more how I was feeling. We'll see. It's also hard on text. I might try calling her after we are both off of work.

With ADHD and SPD combined, directed productive behavior only happens with a lot of forethoght put into it.

175960446,"Hi, I'm losing it mentally. I been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and been off and on medications for 11 years and seen many therapists. I have been suffering since childhood. I'm now in my 30's and still can't see the light to my path. I am currently not taking any medications since February, as I have been trying to manage without them. Even when I'm on them, they work for a short period of time and then my doses have to be increased until I'm at the maximum doses or having too add a second antidepressant. I been on so many antidepressants and anxiety medications. I have given up hope. My anxiety is bad, even when I'm at home alone. I live in a constant state of fear. Is it possible to be in a healthy state of mind without medications? I'm lost and alone with my own thoughts that I even fear myself. It just seems the world is too busy to see or hear me. How do I keep going?"

Phenibut would help with that but I'm staying away from it for a while. I see my new psychiatrist at 3pm. I'm not sure what to say.. Maybe just to tell him about my hospitalization, dissociative panic attacks and needing to see the emergency psychiatrist - That he changed my meds and my meds are good. I'll probably have to tell him about all of my meds. I hope they don't get changed. My mom and regular doctor wants my meds to stay the same.

175960451,lex is very strong ssri. keep dose as low as effective is my recommendation. try adding an herbal supplement like Lthenie and chamonile which is quite effective and what i use when i need a short term boast for anxiety and stress. i also use buspar for this also.

174348722,"hi. prozac seems to be helping -me- at the standard dose of 20mgs/daily. that's on top of my abilify. wellbutrin was OK...I had a bit more energy, mood was better, I ate a tad less...but the dose was too high for a while, i got jittery and ditched it. and... i think with the antipsychotic/tranquilizer, its a matter of hitting the 'sweet spot.' oh, and drug selection, too. im on abilify because it didn't cause the same level of EPS as the other 'atypicals' i tried. does it help negative symptoms? honestly...at low doses, I could see it helping, but at the full dosage, its more like...a less toxic/nasty antipsychotic. if the dosage is too low, personally...problems/symptoms would pop up that would overshadow lingering negative symptoms. why bother? now, excessive dosing...that can definitely zombie-fy people. happened to me...a psych wanted me on 30 abilify, then he topped it off w/ additional abilify to add in an ssri (not prozac). i basically turned into a functioning vegetable. oddly enough...no E
PS. weird, huh? back in the day, ritalin helped. Rx amphetamines kinda did, but...there was this weird feeling, being on an amphetamine and a tranquilizer, at the same time...unnerving, i'll put it that way. i have a friendly acquaintance who takes a seroquel xr at night and an adderall xr in the morning...she likes the combination, she seems to be doing better. each person is different. mirapex has been touted as helping negative symptoms. i have never taken it, so i cannot offer any personal experiences. when possible...meaningful social interaction helps me. low pressure activities, learning new things. writing. tackling projects bit by bit. on a more basic note, just keeping my space clean(ish) and cooking for myself, even hygiene (lather, rinse AND repeat) helps move me along in the right direction. oh, and b-vitamins and antioxidants. those seem to help. i don't know if its placebo, if its a direct affect, or if they just improve response to the psych Rx...but yeah, works for me."
175960455,"I take Xanax. It helps. Valium is another good medication as it relaxes the body. If they even prescribe it anymore. There is Ativan and klonopin. I am not sure which one they would give you. You'd have to discuss with your doctor. There are others I am sure. Having anxiety is no fun. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175960459,"Mood stabilizers prevent seizures/mania. Mania and seizures can kill brain cells too along with psychosis. We only have so many of them; ""Researchers have estimated that about 85,000 neurons die every day in the cerebral cortex. That's equivalent to one every second. However, new evidence suggests that in a specific area of the human hippocampus, known as the dentate gyrus, new neurons are produced continuously into adulthood – around 1,400 a day."" So Idk what age you are: Early 20's? We are still growing brain cells! Stabilize ourselves first. My moms friend with bipolar gets so manic from alcohol that she has seizures and then she can't talk or move. People just write it off as ""She's crazy"" but I'm afraid that she's going to go down a very dark road with the damage she's doing to her cognition.. And all the depression she gets too. It all started because she always stopped her meds. _USER_ID_: The future will be wild though. Cures for everything. Injecting stem cells into certain parts of

I'm excited because she thinks I'm doing well and I've done ""the work"" and met the goals and she talked to my providers and got them all on the same page. She's given me tools to work with and now I just gotta keep it up. She says if I keep it up I will be successful. Still I'm anxious because she's such a positive, encouraging person and who wouldn't want that in your life? I'm anxious about losing the support but I know I have tools and I know who I can go to for support. It's sort of bittersweet I guess. But I'm going to try to think of it positively. I've done a good job. She's proud of me. She thinks I'm doing well. I don't know if I am getting better or just getting more stable. But either way I'll take it. Still I might have to take some anxiety medication today. She was really helpful to me post hospitalization."

175960464,"The end result is the same though, no? I just got banned from another forum I had been posting on since January. I couldn't take the tedium. Threads about what day you do your laundry. So much pearl clutching over manipulated media stories that have no bearing on anybody's day to day life. Having a typhoon in your brain allows you to skip sweating the small stuff. It prevents you from settling into the niche that the world has carved out for you. This is a good way to bypass your conditioning and to freelance your identity. If that identity ends up taking the form of someone who eats their own poo and smashes vending machines because they are trying to control their minds, I'll take that over someone who is genuinely concerned over what celebrity showed up at which fund raiser in that terrible, awful dress."

Next time you have an 8 hour sleep somehow, wake up and drink a tea or coffee and enjoy your time of pure unawareness of your thoughts, feelings and memories before they come flooding in to torment you again. I wouldn't say meditate cuz 2 hours ago there was no hope in hell that I would have been able to meditate. You just need the right meds.

175960479,"_NAME_: I can't even imagine a positive household. Apparently, I passed negativism onto my now grown son because he and I can't be in the same room together. No stranger feeling than, ""I've created a monster who is out to destroy me."" You said, ""I learned positive thinking by practicing positive thinking. I was raised in a positive household."" I was 50 when I learned positive thinking from reading a column in the newspaper. It was written by a woman. It spoke to me. I've been telling people about it ever since. I look back at the mistakes I made when I was negative and in a way, I can't believe it. Which is what I'm trying to get people to avoid now. When I see others walking down that same road as I did, it really gets me. You're talking about how much medicine has helped you, I can give you some history of that. My grandmother, my mother's mother, was bipolar which is where I got it from. My mother didn't have it, it can skip a generation. So my grandmother had bipolar, she just didn't have a
ny medicine, if you can imagine, which you can't. It was in the 1930s and '40s and early 50s, and they had no medicine for emotional problems. They had a mental hospital in every state (see the movie ""One Flew Over the Coo-Coo's Nest"" with _NAME_. It had no medicine, but it had high walls. It was 100 miles from her home. So instead of being treated at her home, like we are, she was treated at the mental hospital, which had no medicine. When she would visit in people's homes, she would look through their medicine cabinet, and anytime she saw some pills she would take some of them. Maybe, one of them would work for her. They didn't. So whenever we take our medicine, yeah, take it for granted. It wasn't always like this. We were born into the right era."
175960480,"The crypto investor that was worse than what the soldiers said made me feel bad about taking care of my mom when I told him about her cancer. Things slipped my mind that hurt her feelings. She says she doesn't forgive herself for neglecting her children and I said I forgive her. But last night she got drunk chatted up a man that seemed nice and was microdosing shrooms. She met him at a restaurant and put him on the phone with me. He said ""I'm on the right path, etc"" then she brought him home and I was talking with him. Then she was making out with him. All these women were drunk and talking to me and each other. I was anxious. I told the guy I was anxious and he said that he didn't give that vibe from me but my pupils were big (Maybe the Vyvanse? idk) but it all made me uncomfortable like I was having a mental psychedelic flashback.

he dumped the wine into her glass last night in front of me and I should have smashed the glass and bottle off the table. But I just let it happen. There's no controlling an alcoholic. I told my sister that it was like a bad trip. She told me to stop comparing life to a bad trip. She took the wine with a tramadol and then started crying saying she's a bad mother. My sister and I brought her to bed and she kept switching between needing water, needing to puke and needing to sleep. It was exhausting but I did my part. She kept saying ""Don't leave me"" maybe 100 times so I stayed with her while she slept so she didn't puke in her sleep or have heart arrythmias. It's really hard. Life is really hard. I don't know what to do anymore. People keep saying I need to find a passion (One thing). That's really disturbing to me. I don't like being told what to do."

The thing with psychosis is that you deny that it is happening until someone says ""K you're sick.. and you must take med"".. But the meds are ok.

He ordered it so that I would get two pills per day at the smaller dose so I could increase it if I needed to. Only I'm not sure if I should or not. Based on the depression score on the assessment from my case manager/care coordinator perhaps I should.

I posted a conspiracy meme and she said ""I don't like conspiracy theories"" - I'm not even into conspiracy theories and honestly I would like to be but I don't have the energy for that.

No one does. This isn't Schizophrenia, I've been diagnosed with it for years. There's no way for anyone to know you have a brain tumor unless you get scanned for it. If you think it may be that, ask. Go to a doctor ans request a brain scan."

175960512,Merry Christmas to you too!
175960513,I have a week left or so it's all good
175960514,"I'm sorry things are so difficult right now. It's good that you have an upcoming therapy appointment. That will likely help a good deal. Until then, try to do your best to breathe, recognize when you are ""shoulding"" yourself (I should be doing more, I should not be crying.. etc.) and try to re-direct yourself to making the next best step for yourself - eating a healthy meal, drinking a glass of water, taking time to consciously take deep, slow breaths, calling a friend. I hope you begin to feel better as soon as possible. Hang in there!"
175960515,"I forced myself to sit down and watch a movie, really enjoyed it too and it took my mind off things"
175960516,"I don't mind once a day. More than once a day and I get paranoid. I'm like WTH. My coworker told me not to worry about it. So I'm trying not to worry about it. I hope I didn't hurt his feelings when I was like, do you want something? Ugh. Social interactions are not my forte."
175960517,You are not alone and you matter. I was in your shoes a year ago. I tried going to Dialectic behavior therapy and am 9 months in. It changed my life.
175960518,"Morning. I went out to swim with my sister today. It was so relaxing to put my head under water and silent all the negative noises above the ground. Also, I was lacking of vitamin D as I had been locking myself in my dark room all the time. My room is as gloomy as my soul."
175960519,Is there something similar but without the withdrawal...have you tried L theanine?

I don't think those should happen to mentally ill patients because it gives anxiety cuz most aren't like me and so high functioning after years of being so sick and that's cuz I'm on meds - Which cost a fortune.. So I blame pharmaceutical companies hoarding all the money they got from making everyone addicted to opioids but then again, that was caused by the American government with their drug propaganda and enforcing it on almost every country in the world, making psychedelics illegal.. _PERSON_"

175960526,"I've read where if you are concerned about the side effects of a pill, you can take only 1/2 of the pill or less. That way, if there are to be any side effects, they will only be half as strong or less. If OK, you could consider taking the other 1/2 of the pill halfway through the time when you will need another one. You can keep taking 1/2 or less until you fee comfortable about the medicine, or believe that it is causing more problems that you can handle, and then perhaps get you doctor to change the medicine. I take most of my medicines at bedtime. While there is concern about side affects, there is also a good chance that the pill could help you. I've read that my attitude going into a problem plays a huge part in its outcome. That is, if going into a problem, I believe I can solve it, it greatly increases my chances of solving the problem, for I have told my mind, ""Look for ways to win."" And it will. However, if I have told my mind, I don't think I can solve this, it will look for ways to lo
se. Your mind is simply doing what you tell it to by your ""feelings"" about the problem. If your feelings about the pill are so poor that you are crying about the results before you take it, then you are anticipating, looking for, getting down on your knees, begging for failure, and it will come. Just like you ordered it. It's not just what's in the pill, it's what in your mind. This problem may work out very well, but with a bad attitude, it's the next problem that's going to get you. Give a man a fish, and you've help him for a day. Teach him how to fish, and you've helped him for a lifetime. At the top of the list of people writing in seeking help in this forum, there is an item called, ""Anxiety-Panic Resources"" which talks about the importance of being positive when trying to solve health or other problems. It's called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) which wants you to know there is more to working on your illness than just taking a doctor's pill. If you want to improve your chances with this and ot
her problems, I think it will behoove you to slow down and read these suggestions, rather than just racing through to when it's time to take the next pill. I know with your mind swirling, it is not easy, but maybe put that on a list of things to do."
175960527,"Yes I took my morning meds. I’ll take my night ones tonight at 8pm, I’ll probably take some vitamin C too."

174348849,I felt scared and not relaxed too much negative symptoms yesterday so I took 100mg Seroquel and then felt numb. I felt numb this morning then really really agitated so I smoked a bit of weed and I didn't feel good because of that.. just stoned in a way so I had something to eat because I didn't feel hypomanic enough to start a 3 day water fast. Then I took 2x 0.5mg xanax because I haven't taken benzos in a while. It was too much - I should have taken just one. I started drifting into dream world while awake and sedated. At least I turned up the heat so I stopped feeling so cold. What a miserable day.. I went to the pharmacy in the cold to get nicotine spray but at least I was dressed warmly. I wish I was hypomanic but I'm withdrawing from phenibut probably. I wish they had better meds for negative symptoms and depression.
175960544,"getting by said... Some people hallucinate on ambien. My husband use to take it and so did I. But if he didn't go right to bed after taking it he sometimes had some hallucinations.

174348860,"Work was so stressful for me today. I had a million questions aimed at me a minute in the morning. I was crawling out of my own skin because of it. And once I start my day like that it lasts for the rest of the day. I couldn't eat my lunch in the _NAME_ so I ate it at the boss' house and there were kids there making crazy sounds jumping all over the place. It just added to my anxiety, and my coworker sits right next to me and ate with his mouth open. All I could do was put on my head phones and blast the show Breaking Bad on my cell phone using Netflix. It was really hahrd to tune out. He likes to talk at people instead of with people, so it's really frustrating. Plus he is from mexico with a thick accent and I always have to tease out what he has to say. He kept on asing if I saw bad man. I said, no, and he laughed and said, You haven't seen bad man? He wanted to talk about the schizophrenic guy in that movie, He meant BATMAN. And he tells me that the bad man in batman, which I assume is scare cro
w, that he is schizophrenic. He thinks im totally insane. If I show a little frustration he thinks im in full on psychosis. Then he tells me not to take my meds. lol right?"

175960548,"Hey there, I went about two weeks with palpitations every day. I went to three different doctors, checked for murmurs/MVPs, and had an EKG. Everything is normal. Except for anxiety. I can only speak for myself but brains are tricky tricky. (A few months before I felt like I couldn't breathe for almost three weeks). Anxiety can cause palpitations which can, of course, cause more anxiety and more palpitations. It's a vicious cycle as I'm sure you know. Perhaps you could do some reading on ""health anxiety."" I bought a few books on it (versus reading the internet) and it has helped me a lot with how anxiety manifests physically, and offers a lot of tips and tricks. And from checking on your past posts, it seems health anxiety might interest you (e.g. ""Overcoming Health Anxiety"" book). Anyways, good luck and be well. As a side note, prednisone can cause your heart to race as well. Post Edited (_USER_ID_) : 12/15/2019 6:06:46 PM (GMT-7)"

Then I gained each time we raised it. I'm exercising (more) but not enough. I need to limit bad carbs and probably quit soda but I'm addicted to soda. Try not to eat meat. Just veggies and beans and rice and stuff like that. Problem is, I eat what my Mom fixes me. I gotta get her to stop cooking meat all the time. We usually have chicken which is healthier than beef, but still, gonna have to do something."

175960553,"The half life of thorazine is 30 hours so there's still 25% (200mg?) of chloropromazine in your system. If you tapered down by half after 24 hours, that's 520mg? So there was much more in your system before you stopped because really you were on 800mg if you were taking it every night. If I were you, I'd slowly decrease it with the help of a doctor. Apparently there's no tolerance or addiction but you never really know because everyone's different. It can cause symptoms of psychosis with withdrawal - Lack of sleep can do this even for people that don't have problems with anxiety or psychosis. Stay safe!"
175960554,Talked to my doctor. He’s proud of me for cutting back on drinking. He thinks maybe my increased anxiety and depression might be because my body is like ‘where’s the booze???’ So hopefully things pick up. Still sticking to the Lexapro. Got a refill. Oh and he’s proud of me for reaching out for a psychologist. I got kudos today.
175960555,"Another really interesting post _NAME_. I want to finish reading the Mental Health Daily article on the different types of delusions. I remember hearing this interview with _NAME_ one time when he said that he thought that his delusions came about as a way to escape the reality of what was really taking place. As far as synchronicity goes, I remember reading _PERSON_ stating that he believed that _PERSON_ proved the validity of its existence with his empirical research. When I was going through my psychotic breaks it was as if I could see synchronicity all around me. Almost everything had symbolic meaning and I was going through some kind of on the fly symbolic ritual. Later when I thought back to what I went through I thought that I was being super superstitious. Not too long after that I was driving down the road and listening to the radio. It happened to be Friday the 13th and the DJ said that some philosopher once said that superstitions where for people that are too stupid to figure things out 
for themselves or can't afford a psychiatrist. I figured I must of been the first group because the psychiatrist I was seeing at the time was free."

174348887,"Could be the Wellbutrin (Bupropion). It's a cathinone. ""Cathinone /?kæ??no?n/ (also known as benzoylethanamine, or ?-keto-amphetamine) is a monoamine alkaloid found in the shrub Catha edulis (khat) and is chemically similar to ephedrine, cathine, methcathinone and other amphetamines. It is probably the main contributor to the stimulant effect of Catha edulis. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a ketone functional group. Other phenethylamines that share this structure include the stimulants methcathinone, MDPV, mephedrone and the antidepressant bupropion among others."" It is a light stimulant so it wouldn't cause as much psychosis as Vyvanse if anything. Also Abilify is a partial agonist of D2 receptors so it also increases dopamine a little. It may be why you're able to read more and stuff. I've had the effect of feeling like God controlling my thoughts and it's not pleasant. That's usually when I take an olanzepine."
175960567,"Keep talking. 7 years my father with a brief reprieve when I was in ICU, maybe 5 years before that and other long stretches before that.

Don't think too much about it if possible. Be a good listener. These are things I still try to practice more myself. You are most assuredly not alone in dealing with astrangement, and you can give yourself a little credit for that and reaching out on a platform like this here by helping you help yourself.

I'm on 175mg a day now instead of 750-1000mg a day... Just take your time, be mindful.. I know you don't want to deal with any of this crap and just want to sleep.. It's quite terrible - Not being able to sleep.. _PERSON_ during the day, you're not rested and you're thinking like ""****.. I'm gonna have to lie down in the darkness, alone, scared with schiz etc and try to stop existing for a while just to immediately wake up exhausted as hell one second later - And go to work..."". You could be at the peak of insomniac madness right now - Or have passed it (Seems likely). It only gets better from here - The longer you go through withdrawal. Ambien has a very short half life (Shorter than zopiclone or temazepam) so it's a good med to take long term. Eventually this nightmare will be over and you'll find some peace, free from psychosis too - You can write, 
drink a few beers every now and then, etc.. I made my own spray but not using it because I'm dealing with mental depersonalization/derealization anxiety (Possibly from alprazolam withdrawal - And the atenolol is masking the physical anxiety). When you get hit with the ketamine, it's like ""Oh cool.. the depression is gone"". It's like taking a benzo for anxiety (People without anxiety don't really get benzo euphoria). I hope you get a good sleep tonight. After not sleeping a couple nights in a row, you can reward yourself with a benzo for suffering so much even as much as skipping a night of sleep sometimes to get to that point.

I am very blessed to have supportive parents. My mom is my rock. I definitely can do volunteer work but like I had stated before it's hard for me to get out there and do things.

Now it's like 24-25 as I'm almost 24. When I'm 26, I'll be overweight and no one will believe me right now... But just wait. That's what antipsychotics do. I remember my old psychologist saying ""I'd hate for you to be pushing 200 pounds"". Well the day has come. It's like a form of body dysmorphic disorder. I didn't like being too skinny either because I remember a few years ago, I took off my shirt to go in the pool and my sister said ""Ew you're so skinny"". I didn't realize. I've been taking an olanzepine every night for about 2 weeks. I've had ZERO psychosis but I must have gained like 10 pounds. Would I rather be psychotic or gain weight? I don't know. I bought Berberine (A replacement for metformin) to test it out. No doctor will take me seriously because I'm a ""Normal weight"" but I'll end up overweight with diabetes even if I 
exercise lots. It's the antipsychotics doing it to me slowly. I know this earlier than everyone else usually does. Part of me doesn't really care but it's uncomfortable to me."

175960608,"It is difficult to answer. In my case, SSRIs seem to have enahnced anhedonia and have a numbing effect. I am not sure if it is my true self that feels nothing really matters and therefore, on the surface am more accepting of myself and others. However, in spite of this apathy I still condemn the external world. One is NEVER too old to do this. I mean seriously, it is in a depressing state of affairs. Bureaucracy, capitalism, other people's greed, lust for power, materialism, ignorance will always bother me. I do believe the right environment can be healing and nurturing, at any age. For me this entails living in nature, with reduced ( not more) human contact. When/if I accomplish this I know I will not need SSRI's and will certainly not suffer any angst about being a little 'off-centre' ( as perceived by others)"
175960609,"You seem to be in a very good spiritual place _AT_MENTION_. I only rarely get to that point. Now I'm blinded by a SHEET of PURPLE.. I am a king.. But no there really is a point where a certain philosophy or way of thinking can really solve any mental problem that anyone is in. Most psychedelics are ""entheogens"" (a chemical substance, typically of plant origin, that is ingested to produce a nonordinary state of consciousness for religious or spiritual purposes).. Hmm a drug that induces spiritual healing - But you don't even need them because spiritual states can be manifested in sobriety. Psychedelics are illegal in the western world because as much as I wouldn't like to believe, it benefits the rich for people to suffer.. It's similar to making purple illegal.. I'm in a state where I'm trying to research crypto - But also trying to find inner peace and spirituality/meditation/content so it's similar to yours. I used to be extremely logical and loved science when I was a kid. My parents would buy 
me chemistry sets, telescopes and stuff like that but it all changed once my ex step dad manipulated my family and trained me like a dog for years. I think ~90% of people have some awareness of what I didn't have before my trip. I am a bit different just because I was ""the doubter""/atheist or skeptic and I got to ""put my hand into the womb"" while nobody else did.. So I seem to be on both sides of everything now. I'm trying to practice gratefulness and get my creativity back. I'm happy that you're painting - I could draw/paint but I'm not 100% of anything right now. I need a vacation or to relate to people IRL maybe make friends. Either people are assholes or they're like me but way more ""out there"" than me. I think the best way to do this is to meditate - That's why I'd like to use a virtual reality headset and lie down while I use the internet cuz it's like my brain is completely functional but my body is exhausted - That's how I see it... I'm so heavy and worn down that I don't want to make effort - L
ike lifting weights.. Exercise would help - All of these things would.. The good things.. Not drugs. After I stopped using hard drugs, I'm back where I started.. I have to relive, finding meaning to reality and to not escape it. I'm faced with a wall that I have to climb over which I ignored my whole life. I'm ready now. I'm still not sure if I want to live but I better make that decision soon and live with full attention, motivation and try to let go of my past and not to regret it."

175960616,"Hello -- so sorry to hear what you are going through. Of course, you feel worried, upset, frustrated and want to help. Your dual-diagnosis boyfriend needs to obtain professional help to achieve stability before he can fully benefit from a peer-led program, such as AA. His immediate needs are an appointment with a psychiatrist, who most likely will prescribe medication, addiction counseling and therapeutic support/counseling to learn how to make lifestyle changes. When a person has depression and addiction, it is sometimes called dual-diagnosis. People with depression find it hard to reach out for help sometimes. People with addiction are reluctant to give up their addictions. One thing you can do for him is research the mental health centers in your community. You should be able to find this information on your local government website under ""human services"" or similar. Call or email the agency in charge of mental health (they will also handle addiction). They will either provide direct services 
(therapy, support, diagnosis, medication) or refer you. Outpatient day programs are excellent. He might attend a program like that, for example, for several weeks. Once you find and write down or print this information, you can ask him if he would like you to be with him while he calls one of these agencies for help. Don't nag him about it. Just present him with the option. But just once. If he doesn't take you up on it, I suggest you leave him and get on with your life. Therapy will help you understand why you chose him and why you remained with him. There are also 12 step groups (free) that help men and women understand life with an addict and healthy boundaries. Dedicate yourself to your own recovery and self-care. Focus on your favorite interests, reconnect with your friends and family and think about your values and goals. All that may have taken a back seat while you were concerned about this man and his problems. His addictions did not and will not allow him to give you the same consideration you give 
him. Those addictions are his master. Until this man enters recovery and treatment for BOTH alcoholism/gambling AND depression, he will be an anchor that drags your life down. Plenty of people with these problems do reach out for help. Hopefully, he will call the numbers you give him. But if he does not, remember: a man who says he loves his daughter but doesn't get the help he needs loves his addictions more than his daughter. A man who says he loves his daughter but isn't around for her doen't appreciate that love is a verb. A man who isn't good to his daughter is no good to his girlfriend or wife. Some things in life are simple and it doesn't get anymore basic than that. This man is okay with putting you through hell. That's on him but if you let him put you through hell, that's on you. Everyday, you are responsible for your own happiness, your own wellbeing, and if you have children, theirs. But that's it. So, deep inside, you know what to do. You focus on you and you focus on your family. You focus on pe
ople who uplift you and cherish you. You focus on your own needs - exercise, eating right, having fun, working, connecting with people who are good for you and getting support. You have given him plenty of chances. Give him just one more -- the chance to get real help from a professional. Then move on. P.S. If he ever mentions suicide again, and you believe he has a plan, do not hesitate to call 9-1-1 if he is with you and refuses to go to an ER. Don't put yourself through any misery over it, just do it. In some cases, a police officer will accompany him to the ER or mental health ER. This doesn't mean he is in trouble, that's just what they do."

175960631,"Hi friend and welcome back! Although I am sorry to hear that it is due to increase anxiety currently for you. :/ One of my most powerful/helpful tools is the repetition of Positive Mantras. It does take practice and some time for the reassuring phrases to help calm us down, and to start to change our thinking process... ...but change things it will! Our brains and its chemistry actually believe the positive words we speak and the anxiety is derailed or even prevented by this important practice. If negative thinking increases anxiety (and we know it does!) then positive thinking decreases it. We have a link in the Resources on this...or you can simply take your worries/fears, and create your own reassurances to speak to them. Best with getting your management where you need it to be again! Keep posting so we can keep you encouraged. S.C."

Do some breathing exercises during the panic attacks. Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth. While breathing out through the mouth, purse your lips and control that breath.

I figure you can only get constantly rejected so many times before either it turns you into a psychopath, so you don't care about others and get a thrill from keeping secrets from them (especially authority figures if they ever treated you like you were stupid) or it makes you feel suicidal. I'm also going through the peri menopause so feel I'm having more psychopathic thoughts lately. Interestingly Autism was once (many years ago) described as ""autistic psychopathy'. I wonder if I've been unknowningly carrying a pre-disposition to become a psychopath when the menopause kicks in? I mean if women who were previously thought to be 'normal' can develop things like late onset schizophrenia due to menopause?? It could explain the ons

175960664,"I think the best way is to be mindful like any other stressor. Try to have a more positive outlook on them. For me, voices didn't bother me - I tried to find meaning in them just to occupy myself. With delusions, you need to trust yourself and realize that YOU aren't your THOUGHTS. You're much more. Make a time during the day - Every day, to challenge the delusions.. But that's less important than talking to a therapist or someone close to you about them so you have a different perspective (99%, people don't believe in the delusion and will reassure you. The delusion will come back within a few seconds but positive reinforcement can help to train your brain to realize when certain thoughts aren't real). Until then, keep trying different antipsychotics to find one that works. Everyone reacts differently to every med because we all have different brains and neurochemistry."

I don't get to see her all the time, so this was quite a shock. She is 22 and self-supportive, I am not sure what to do next. Our parents, who are a huge part of our life, seem unaware and I am worried that my sister does not have any real support in whatever she is going through. I would like to talk to her about her situation and offer any help or support that I can, but she does not know that I know what she has been prescribed. She also lives alone in another state and I'm worried how a call might go if I were to inquire her about her situation. Could anyone offer me any advice on how to approach this with her and how to encourage her to open up to our parents if she hasn't already? If this part isn't clear, I'm not sure if she has talked to my parents because if I ask them about the medication and they weren't aware, I w

174349040,"I'm not schizophrenic but I have some psychotic symptoms. I often have to remind myself that I can't know what people are thinking / feeling, and how they are reacting to me, because my brain likes to automatically go there."
175960685,"These are interesting questions, or perhaps difficult to frame a response that provides clear information e.g. would be clear enough that if you met her you would have an ""aha moment"" sufficient to say ""This is the person described"". In so far as a long-term personality I would say it is somewhere between angry and significant internal insecurity and any sense of not having ""control"" will push her to anger or coldness. She is very ""black and white"", I think the actual term is dichotomous. It would be entirely accurate to say she struggles to see the complexity in people and situations and is unable to recognize that things are often not either perfect or horrible, but are something in between. Like a phrase casually used and not cause for alarm that someone took exception to something. She is reserved to withdrawn in social settings. She will reluctantly attend such an event but never without a drink or two or three first. Places like a mall or large grocery stores, places with crowds she a
voids to any extent possible. I know that sounds bleak but in small groups of 4 to 6, say perhaps neighbors, at what we call ""Bloody _NAME_ Sunday"" which is small group that meets at the HOA early on Sunday morning during the summer she is engaged and talkative, even when we used to have small ""poker games"". This stopped one evening when she became angry and never restarted. So far as enjoying doing things this is his or miss. She did enjoy riding on the back of the _NAME_- until she didn't. I own a small cattle operation as sort of a hobby ranch with a partner she at one time was very enthusiastic about it, until she wasn't. She is pretty much a stay at home person-- who enjoys drinking. In ""normal"" times she likes to have ""movie night"" or she wants me to watch ""crime shows"" on T.V. (like 48 hours or review of actual cases). Friends? None that she cares to see on a routine basis. She does have a friend she has known since childhood, whom she will regularly turn, but this is usually when she is angr
y. They do not meet but a few times a year, despite her living less than two miles away. Again unless she is particularly angry with me. She is not what I would call ""bubbly"" but when things are good she is happy, affectionate and even wanting to discuss future plans. I have learned however this is transient. For example, once we planned a ski trip about 4 months out. I paid the advance rental, we purchased replacement ski togs. about three weeks out she got mad over something and announced the following day she was not going. After a week of working to resolve this- and failing, I canceled the trip in order to get a least a portion of the rental back. Later it was, ""why did you cancel, you must not actually want to go with me."" This has happened a couple of times to the point now, if a trip is planned, I let her make the reservation and the deposit. She does love going to the beach or traveling to places like Jamaica or Mexico and while there she is a remarkably happy person. On a road trip, she is not p
articularly talkative and truly does not observe things in passing cars or along the roadway generally. Of course, if it was truly remarkable she would comment. I will say she is perhaps an awful ""back seat driver"". She talks some but this is episodic. She does have original ideas, as stated above, however again it is difficult to depend on these for some ""future"" time. She did agree to see a professional for a few sessions, we tried three different individuals. The problem was, and I could see it on her face, just as soon as they probed or made a Socratic question that remotely suggested there could be an issue, we would make the next appointment, but sometime in the next few days or the day of, she would say she was not going back, I could go but she saw no need. The typical response was ""Why should I go, they are only going to tell me what I already know, what is the point of paying for that."""

175960702,I stopped watching the news a month ago. I'm too exhausted.
175960703,"as an added response, I guess I wrote on here to vent. I have my own child to care for. She is 17 and has issues with depression and anxiety. I have so much going on in my own life, how can I tear myself in half, and take care of my Mother's AND sister's responsibilities? Especially being 3 1/2 hours away. This all came out at me suddenly after a full year of my sister not allowing my mother to contact me, now contacts me, not for the greater good I feel, but because she wants to assure herself that she has family members to come to for help, in the event my mother GOD forbid passes on, she is less that income. I guess I feel she is not stepping up the way I would. My mother is not in danger, but my sister for example takes the easy way out and gives her a bag of donuts for breakfast, rather than a healthy meal. If I express concern to her, she responds by not responding to my calls when I call to check on my Mother. She also lets her kids stay up all night since its summer vacation, and My mother 
has told me they wake her up at night. She has been so absent as a parent emotionally for her kids, that they seem more like her sisters than children. Child protective services are already involved and does wellness check on the kids. My mother has a nurse come once a week, so at least she gets checked on in that respect. I guess I feel my Mom's life is not as happy as I would like it to be. I am overwhelmed with guilt and heartache. I feel this is too big for me at this point in my life, and feel its stressing me sick."

175960716,"I'm still avoiding most people in my real life, not sure why I'm thinking about how some people in the snake community keep ""hots"" (venomous ones) as pets. It's growing in popularity. I think it's a stupid thing to do but at the same time I'm envious of them. I'd say, the most popular are Vipers (especially Gaboons), Rattlesnakes, and Cobras. People are even getting into breeding designer ""morphs"" (like they do with many other snakes), so that there's more variety in colors and patterning. I saw someone put up a photo of letting their Gaboon Viper sunbathe out on their lawn. There's nothing wrong with having something thicker-bodied and non-venomous like a boa or python out in the grass (if you're confident you could catch it if necessary), but a deadly venomous snake sounds a bit foolish."
175960717,"Hello! I am a 30 y.o female. I can't exercise because I get major chest pains. Running is a big no no for me. It has been like that for me since I was 12 years old. When I was 24ish, I was at work (grocery store) and all of a sudden I couldn't breathe properly and my chest had major pain. I left work early and went to a walk-in clinic. They only did an EKG and provided me an in-haler. That was the first time having an in-haler. Through out the year that thing helped me a lot, along with fresh air and very supportive co-workers. One thing to help ease my mind is to listen to music. I learned from another person to focus on just one instrument in a song. JUST ONE INSTRUMENT. It helps tremendously when I feel stressed as heck. During the past 1.5 years, I've been dealing with vertigo like symptoms and heart palpitations. My primary doc referred me to a cardiologist. Had a 24hour monitor hooked to me. Nothing showed up. I went back 6 months later and he referred me to an ENT kinda doc who specializes o
n Ear, Neck and Throat disorders. I'm currently going to appointments with them for balancing and more. Last Friday, the same exact episode of anxiety attack happened again. This time, I truly believe the pain was more intense on the chest, right breast. Again, left work early (grocery store still) and went to walk-in. Had the EKG and an X-ray this time. Everything seemed normal. I did use an oxygen tank for the first time. It helped my breathing very well. The chest pain lasted for about 24 hours. I work at a grocery store Full Time having to wear a mask. That thing is detrimental to my health. I have been complaining for months about it. I know that the mask wearing was a key component to this attack. So now I have a note for work to minimize my mask wearing. That seems to help normalize my breathing a tiny bit. I don't know your situation with mask wearing, but I suggest to stay away from it as much as you can! Besides stress, are you an overly-emotional person? Do you see a therapist to talk to? Have you 
been tested for anything mentally? Talking to a therapist is a wonderful way to stay a bit more less stressed. They are very resourceful people who can help in ways to cope with certain situations. I seen my first professional one (having to pay for one, lol) when I was 27. I've been seeing my current one for two years now. Wish you the best of luck with your appointment. Let us know how you did!"
174349084,"Hi friends, I smoked weed last fall twice and tripped out both times; it was an unreal experience. During late spring this year I was laying in bed shortly after waking up (2-3minutes) and my partner was changing and I believe I saw a woman coming from behind her. It only lasted for 3 seconds or so. I instantly freaked out and just didn't know what was going on. I must have smoked weed about 10 times in my life and I wasn't high the night before this so why did this happen? I have a parent with mental illness(not severe mood disorder) and a sibling with similar symptoms so I will never smoke or intake weed or any drug of that kind again for sure but I am afraid now that I have ruined my life. I don't hear voices or anything like that or even think people are out to get me. I don't know if this was some sort of sleep related hallucination but I was awake in bed for already a couple of minutes. I also suffer from severe health anxiety. Over the past year I've thought I have had Parkinson's and MS. Ov
er the past week I thought I had multiple personality disorder such as BPD and NPD to the point where I asked to go to the hospital a few days ago and went. I have had 3 MRIs in fear of having a brain tumor... Do these symptoms sound like schizophrenia? What is it like living with this. debilitating disease? I also have been diagnosed with ADHD."
175960718,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, but self-serving and short-lived. I'll have an opinion on anything and can argue quite elegantly on most subjects, but I can't really think of anything that I genuinely feel strongly about. My wife says I love her as a verb, rather than an adjective. It's self-serving, so I do what she needs to be happy. She knows this, but the fact that I do it is more important than the reason behind it. I care about my kids, but tend to see them as possessions to be protected. My parents were good people. They went through a whole pile of crap with me as a child and they did what they could, bearing in mind that they didn't have me biologically. But, I ripped them off and stole from them, manipulated them and didn't grieve when they died. When my mother died, my condition really hit home to my wife; she said that it was a defining moment in her understanding. I was working about two hours away and, when she told me my mother was dying in the next few days (it wasn't expected up to that point), 
my first response was, ""will she last until Friday, as I'm busy?"" I still went out that evening with a few of the guys from work and had no real concept of what my wife was going through at the hospital. I got drunk and phoned her when I got back to the hotel, telling her some of the stuff we'd been laughing about, as I thought it would cheer her up. I got home on Friday and we went to the hospital, where I became the concerned and loving son, which switched off when everyone disappeared. She still talks about it. I'm not quite sure how it affected her. She's explained it well, and I understand it, but it doesn't make much sense."

175960738,"My situation is probably not as bad as yours but I have been struggling with my mom too. She is constantly talking about politics recently and whenever I voice my opinion she gets mad and yells at me and refuses to consider the points that I am making and it just leaves me feeling really stressed. I have started just trying to avoid any controversial topics and when she brings things up, I just don't say anything because that seems to be the best thing for my mental health. Another thing is that my OCD is bad right now so maybe for example if I don't want to eat the dinner she made because she didn't wash her hands between petting our dog and making the food, she gets mad at me and acts like what I am dealing with is SUCH a burden for HER. It's especially annoying because she has mental illnesses and has gone to a therapist in the past so I don't know why she can't be more understanding of my issues that I am trying to deal with. My tips from my experience are to try avoiding talking to her about t
hings you know will set her off (easier said than done obviously) and make sure you take some time for yourself each day to decompress and do something that you like, like listen to music or take a bath or read, etc. You could try doing telehealth therapy also, that's what I'm doing. The best thing would be to not have to live with her if she is emotionally abusive to you, but sometimes that's hard to accomplish. Good luck!"
175960739,"Well, that sounds good. You said the lamictal is helping, which is teriffic. It’s good that you jogged 2 miles. And then you say, “Because of the cyclic nature of my feelings, yeah, I wonder about the other shoe dropping.” My words were going to be, “Get ready.” Meaning, times could get tough. But that’s when we need positive thinking more than ever, when it might be difficult to think that way because times could be tough. Or as you said, “Best I can do is hang in there and keep it up.” And you say, “Lately I’ve been able to actually sleep.” Which is what I’m going through right now, trouble sleeping. I’m trying different remedies."

SSRI could be possibly making them worse? Idk.. The longer you're on it, the better it should be.. so just give it time. I know it can be scary but remember this; With pure obsessive OCD thoughts, no one has EVER acted on one. It's true. Unless you really wanted to do it, you wouldn't be thinking about it because OCD people are intelligent, anxious and empathetic! Sometimes OCD can turn into psychosis..

175960751,"Let me share a European view. (Sorry to spoiler the interesting conspiracy theories with boring science). Here in Europe we have some countries that did ran out of hospital capacity. There are people arriving at the hospital, cannot get proper treatment and die - maybe sitting in a chair while they would need oxygen or a respiratory treatment. Doctors actually do disconnect 80 year old people from the respiratory device to give it to a 50 year old person, the 80 year old persons die then. (Triage). The army is searching dead people and they find a lot in the streets. Other European countries still have sufficient capacities, there far less people die. Statistics say the difference is 10% die in the countries who are short in hospital capacity and 1% in countries with sufficient capacity (however, this statistics has a bias because some countries test less than others). Scientists (well known ones, by a state order) here simulated a free outbreak and came to the result that roughly 50% (forgot the n
umber) of the population would become sick, mainly in June/July, and then the outbreak would stop because the majority would be immune. However, the scientist estimated hundrets of thoudands of deaths by this approach (in a 80 mil. people county). So in Europe the strategy is, to slow down the outbreak to an extend that the health system can cope with (more or less). Drawback: The countermeasures would have to last until 2021. The slower, the longer ... Then 70% of the population would have had the sickness, be immune (or dead), and then the immunity of the population would be sufficient, and the sickness stops on its own. I hope that a vaxine or a medical treatment will appear soon, because the economy cannot wait until 2021. I see three options: a) Don't slow down. Population is immune in harvest. On a worldwide scale millions will die. b) Slow down. Far! less people will die (remember 10% vs 1% above). But it lasts a looong time. c) Slow down until vaxine/medication has been released. Then spread it and re
lease the counter measures. (Or in theory d) vastly extend the clinical capacities and then let the outbreak run freely. But that's not realistic. Machines and new staff need time to be prepared.) I like c) most and wonder that there are billions and billions available for economic help, but I don't hear from billions and billions for vaxine/medication research ? Incl. money to speed up the regulation authorities. My grand-grand-father died by the spanish flue by the way in 1918. Such events aren't so special maybe ..."

Depending on were you live and how early your appointment was set for, you may very well have already be finished with your consultation. If that is the case how did it go? If you've yet to go, then I echo _NAME_ advice of practicing deep slow breathing, as well as repeating reassuring and positive mantras to yourself as you wait to be seen. The Resources that she mentioned will be great to look into for more long term help in managing your anxiety and worrying about health related matters. We have a few sites there that help specifically with Health Anxiety that you can get started with. If you find you need more help in this area, then looking into getting a therapy consult/referral would be the next step to take. As far as your question regarding what SSRi's/A/D's are safe during pregnancy, asking your OBGYN w
ould be best. We have had several mommies here who had healthy deliveries/babies while taking their Rx's, but everyone is different with differing needs, so your obstetrician will tell you what the best plan would be. Post with us anytime for support and understanding. We care and are here to listen. Hoping you got some good answers from your doctor today. Update us if you like! _PERSON_ Cat"
174349166,There was a thread about this in the bipolar forum...I believe there are a couple of aspects.....in bipolar you have psychosis during mood episodes only while with sza you can have it any time. Although there is some sort of formal thought disorder associated with sza as well I don’t know much about it.
175960784,"Greetings folks, a small and surreal update: At 4am yesterday, my wife called me and said that she had rented a room downtown...asked me to pick her up...so I drove over, picked her up and thereafter, we went to McDonald's for breakfast...she said she was very sorry for leaving... Then, I drove us back home to sleep... At about 7.30am, she woke me up and said that she felt very sick and needed to go to IMH...surprise surprise! So, groggily, I woke up, drove us there. Went to A&E. She was crying badly one moment, and then singing and laughing the next. And then we saw the doctor. I passed my letter to the doctor and my wife described some details about why she left and how she felt about stuff...The doctor arranged for a thorough review of her condition in June and in the meantime, prescribed a double dosage of Valproate, as well as,...hold it there.... I don't know the name of the 2nd med cos' I can't check it! Cos...when we went back home to sleep again and I woke up at 12+pm( I start work late an
d end work late), heavens, she was gone, some clothes were gone and the meds were gone... So...it's super surreal...she actually came back, she actually went to IMH, she actually was prescribed medicine, the medicine is with her, BUT she's not with me... The last I heard from her before falling asleep, she was calling to cancel the rented room in the apartment...maybe she returned cos' she couldn't cancel...I don't know what the heck is happening either...she has not responded to my three or four messages either... Guess I'm sleeping alone tonight again... Super surreal day. It's like Thanks God, but huh? Guess time will reveal His plan..."

175960799,"Today I will be writing about support. I want start off by saying, everyone is going through something. No one can understand what that person is going through. They can only support them. I have a lot of people complaining to me about their life. As I have said before it has drained me. But I always think to my self at least you have support. I call it back up. Some people don't have that at all. They go my bestfriend, my parents, my significant other or my kids don't get me. I have no idea what goes on in these relationships but I'm pretty sure it's not bad. I say that because they call these people. Ask them for advice and support and say they love them. I think how people like me don't even have that. I don't have a good relationship with anyone right now. I feel like people only became close to me cause I make them feel better about their problems. But that's not love or support, that's a leech. So, what I'm trying to say is I could never know anyone situation or their pain. But could you imag
ine going through all this hurt and not having anyone their for you. No one to talk or cry to. Some people like me have to wake up everyday and say what's the point. I understand venting but sometimes people call me and say I can't make it I give up on life. Then say so and so took them out. Their kids said I love you. Someone they claim, they hate. Or that person doesn't love them. Gives them money, let's them live with them or found them a job. I think to my self you have support. Well, if you want to end it all. I should have been did it lol. But seriously it drains all of who you are to hear people complain about having a little bad day. I have them everyday lol. People should focus on the good things. Be thankful that you have someone their for you. Especially, if they know your problems and still support you. That's what I try to do, focus on the good. And I don't even have a support system. I often ask my self what keeps you going lol. Some people like me wish they could come across some unconditional 
love. Just saying your life couldn't suck as much as mines. And I'm laughing. Just saying that's why my phone is off lol"
174349191,"I felt better this morning and did all of my work. I also got some prep work done for this week's lessons. I am doing well again!! I was feeling out of it last night. But, today has been great! I went shopping for food. Then, I returned and vacuumed, cleaned the bathroom, and now am doing my laundry. I am doing great! Sleep does wonders for my head. I have to go to the doctor tomorrow. I am running out of medication. I hope I don't have to see him each month, but we shall see. I did not see him last month due to covid-19. I feel fine again!! The weather here is muggy though. I don't like it and am sweating when I go outside. I signed up to substitute for other teachers who go on vacation. I hope I can do this. I am doing fine but at times feel overwhelmed like yesterday. But, I will manage somehow by resting and relaxing when possible. The key is to rest when I can."
175960800,"Some of my favorites are _NAME_ Foster _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_, the historian, _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, and I love anything written by the NY Times columnist _PERSON_, whom I would like to marry, but she is married, so, don't really know how that is all gonna work for me. Plus, I have never met her. I also read a ton of ndewspapers, mostly the Times, The Guardian, Sydney Herald, South China Morning Post, and a few others from around the US, Seattle, Atlanta, etc. Mostly these are places I have lived before. I try to get as many perspectives as I can."
175960801,"Since I joined last week, I have opened up to my husband a little more about my daily struggles. We have agreed to do a dialogue every evening before we routinely start our binge watching on TV. Just that small effort between us has helped me feel less isolated and sad. Thank you, Lord."
175960802,"The cloud of psychosis has passed, and now I'm faced with the fact that everybody knows because everybody talked. There was no hacking or gangstalking, it's just that truth willed out, that's Occam's razor, and because of the extreme nature of how crazy and radical my psychosis was, and the effect it caused, of course everyone would know because it was so crazy. This doesn't make me feel much better. However, it explains everything. It all makes sense now. Now it's just a matter of how further it will spread. And all of this time I was on twitter yelling out into the void of how frustrated I was making an *** of myself. I'm such a fool, and it makes me look even worse as an individual. God I'm lucky that my psychiatrist recommended me to exactly the person I needed. I see him Monday evening."
175960803,Remind me next time I think of no meds how awful I feel without them. I feel so much better now on them. Even one day makes a difference.
175960804,I'm sorry! I hate them for you!
175960805,"Idk, I take many separate walks throughout the day"

175960809,"I’ve been so unmotivated at work lately. Wouldn’t know it but I won a $50 amazon gift card from work. So that’s cool. I have some paperwork to do tomorrow I’m not excited for. Been procrastinating on it. Bleh. I see my psych tomorrow after work! I’m excited for it. I keep mentioning it, sorry. Like I said before I feel like I have a lot to talk about. Intrusive thoughts aren’t so bad but it’s good to talk about. I’ve been learning programming languages during my lunch using free learning from work. Pretty nifty. I’ve also been studying for my computer course I have an exam on in a couple weeks. Psych course exam is on Halloween. Starting new courses on November 1st. I’m excited for that too."
175960810,"I live on a large piece of Somerset moorland and I can assure you that consumptive maidens in floaty nightdresses and brooding anti heroes will be prosecuted for trespassing, and if I encounter the beast it'll end its days as a novelty tea cosy. I never had much time for gothic fiction, I get bored of the endless drama and characters who mostly just need to get their sh*t together. More to the point I suspect disappearing further and further up your own bum is likely to make you more vulnerable to the demands of the real world when they inevitably occur. Ultimately my own castle is built on apathy, comtempt and the knowledge that my own agency isn't something which can be easily interfered with without my complicity. I take the attitude that you can either act or be acted upon so proactive engagement actually prevents outside interference."
175960811,"Many people who have struggled with mental illness elect to seek treatment for their illness. And some of them in America must go on state disability while they're recovering, as they can't work full time at a job because of their issues. But some of them are able to overcome their illness and get off being on disability, and are able to work full time once again. However, some of them are unable to do so and must stay on disability for the rest of their lives. Having to be on state disability for the rest of your life, to me, is not complete successful psychiatric treatment. To me, it's partial success. But at the same time, I'm glad that many individuals are able to make progress in fighting their illness, even if they never fully recover and never are able to work full time once again. They are able to live happy, productive lives in spite of it."
175960812,"I'm kind of worried about her. She under extreme stress right now,I talked on the phone with her for awhile and she said it helped"
175960813,Doc increased my Vraylar to 6mg and said I could use my old Haldol as a PRN when I'm having a bad psychosis night.
175960814,"I am a very private, proud and positive person but I would like to lay it all out there because this is probably the only time I would and this is hopefully a place where someone can relate and offer some advice on how to move forward so please be patient with me. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. After a visit to the hospital to collect my meds recently (I am currently living and working in Thailand) the nurse was Brilliant at obtaining my medical history. With my medical background as a Paramedic in Johannesburg South Africa (which I have to thank for my PTSD) and my lifetime history with my mental illness her questions we all relevant and I realised that what I considered flaws actually could explain so much. I suffer from PTSD - under control and manageable (some situations. loud noices, bangs, someone giving me a fright, and confrontation are still all triggers but as I said controlled and manageable) OCD - manageable and I can control myself but frustration can often lead to tears 
once I am put of the situation. Dyslexia - an every day battle especially as I am an English teacher. But I have a medical license and PPL aviation license so only mild insecurity there. RLS - shaking or movement of my lower limbs especially my feet awake for asleep. Chronic headaches - this has been a life time struggle and the everyday norm besides the odd migraine (in bed under the covers) once every 4 to 6 months. Bipolar - perfectly managed with meds and self control Anxiety - permanent struggle leaving me wired and tired emotionally drained (not conducive for all relationships) Tic - permanently flicking or picking at my thumb nails especially when I'm trying to concentrate (this is not noticeable unless I am really anxious. HSP - this is my biggest problem and I can not seem to manage it. Substance abuse - alcohol use to a be an escape but mostly ended up with an episode. I smoke marijuana once a day before bed (I like it but don't need it) and then there is the all favorite benzodiazepine and ritalin 
not to mention a past with Cat addiction. My substance abuse is not an addiction (besides the CAT for 6 months) but if I have it I will take more than prescribe to get a rush or high. If my month quota is up the I simply wait for the next month. I don't go looking for it but if i have it i abuse it so yes it is a problem. Lastly, hear is the kicker. An undiagnosed mystery with no answers or treatment that has worked - I lactate. For the last 16 years I have had milk in my breast ready to feed a baby at a drop of a hat. Never had any children! Just milk all day long. Very embarrassing. I am currently on bipolar and Anxiety meds. No benzodiazepine (because I enjoy those way to much) So as you can see above I have a lot to deal with but am managing rather well according to my lifes history. But that is exactly my point, I am in a great space. Yes I am still haunted and tested every day but I feel now is the time to look inward and begin to actually start healing instead of coping. A few months ago some people sa
y (I found myself) but basically I just realised that I am to blame. My actions. My consequences. My decisions clear minded or during an episode. The pain is mine. I owned it. All of it. No blame just me. By doing this I feel like I have given control back to myself. I can finally face the truth and now I can do something about it! I have been coping for so long, my question is how do I move forward. What do I work on first and how do I do this work. I am unable to seek counseling as the language barrier and culture in Thailand is to great and has proved to be ineffective. I can not work on my PTSD trauma alone. Does anyone have absolutely any advice."
175960815,"Life is worth living even after something devastating like this, even if you go on alone. Some practical steps to take: Believe it or not, the right music can significantly help whether it's listening, playing, or singing, you can find consolation in music. Express your feelings. If your girlfriend is unable to communicate with you, express your feelings here on this forum. We'll listen. Or with a therapist/counselor or find someone to talk to, a relative, an old friend. If you're religious, Psalms 94:19 says ""When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me"" meaning that when we have nobody else to talk to, who comforted us? Who soothed us? God himself DOES take an interest in you. Talk about it with Him, every feeling, every hurt, every thought. Meditate on things that are comforting. If you like to read, read things that make you smile whether it's silly memes or favorite books, articles on what you're going through, things that you take an interest in. Stay busy if it's working wit
h your hands or doing things you enjoy whether it's exercising, walking, house projects, playing with pets, your secular work. Whatever you can do to stay calm during this difficult time. I hope you can find some peace and comfort."
175960816,Even off meds I couldnt do these.
175960817,"I feel so overwhelmed. I went to the crisis program today because my case manager suggested it as an alternative to hospitalization. They have tv, movies, netflix, art supplies, cards, etc You can basically just go there to chill out if things aren't going well. It's at the clinic I see my psychiatrist and therapist at. They did an assessment and said my meds probably need to be tweaked, so I see my psych on thursday. I was too tense to do any of the activities so I just kind of left after the assessment"

175960822,"Hi, I hope your keeping well and could I ask if this is a reoccurring even or if it was an one off. Also what's your BF's back ground."
175960823,"I haven't been eating very much lately. I had a bag of chips, 3 beers, an energy drink, and a big _NAME_. I'm trying to lose more weight. I don't know if I can keep this up. Lithium ruined my metabolism. God I hate that psychiatrist."
175960824,"Being content and privileged (and not to mention having a different line of mental disorder) may be the reason that you don't understand it - which is exactly why I suggested the contentment and being comfortable as options. Luckily, I can go over to science when I choose - and I obviously enjoy doing that too. Why do you assume all religious people think things like ""Jesus will sort it out after they die"" and that's what it's about? I've already told you why someone like me would enjoy spirituality. It might help you to know that better minds than you or I have believed in a variety of ""obviously bollocks"" including some influential scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers throughout history. Feel free to look into it. I can't say that I'm interested - I'm primarily interested in following up on things that pertain to me, if I notice. However, as far as other threads go, the real ""virus"" here is getting triggered enough to be rude on an ongoing basis."
175960825,"Lol I remember being in a hotel and from the ceiling all I heard was ""oo oo oo"". It was like 4am. I always hear people having sex"
175960826,"Okay. Took my saving out of PayPal. If tomorrow it’s already in my local bank account then I will go to the hospital. Hopefully it’s there tomorrow. My headache is unbearable. _PERSON_ messed up with my hormones too so I’ve been feeling stressed. It’s 5 AM now, I will eat something probably being full will help me to fall asleep."
174349231,I can definitely see them being connected. My psych thought it was an interesting idea when I said it. We don’t really talk about my psychotic disorder because she’s not a medical doctor and I started seeing her because of social anxiety but she doesn’t mind me talking about it.
175960827,"I have gained about 30 pounds this year so far. I'm planning on ordering pizza soon from whichever place has two liter bottles of Coke and Fanta Orange. 3 two liters of Coke, and 2 two liters of orange. I could wait longer for the pizza but I'm dying for the pop. Tomorrow is Friday and I should order because it will be easier than on the weekend.

175960835,"This is so weird but from the time I first posted this (about a month ago) to now, I've completely changed my mind, and now feel like I don't need or even want to pursue finding another doctor to give me Xanax! I will always want to have a small supply on hand because it makes me feel better knowing I have some in case of an emergency, but for whatever reason, my anxiety is back to what I would call normal levels and I am feeling good and am happy with life again overall. Probably a combo of quitting smoking, beginning to exercise some again and more time passing having no contact with my abusive ex all helped."

175960838,"Thanks for this post! This is intense for me, for many. I am doing my best to not tune into the news non stop but I must stay informed. All I can do is stay home, try to eat healthy, walk, breathe and find a way to let the stress out of my body. We've never seen anything like this before. Maybe we don't know how to deal with it. Sometimes faith is all that is left. When we've done all we can to be safe, know that we are all doing the right thing to keep ourselves safe. We are also here to support each other."

Work pressure, of 100f while walking steep roofs, climbing 40ft ladders, facing the scorn of implicit bias from ignorant philosophy professors who haven't worked a day in their life (honestly, if they call being a PHL professor a job, then they are in the wrong profession), I've faced poverty, I've faced one of the most severe mental illnesses there is, I've faced people who are prejudice, Ive withheld opinion of an ex girlfriend that's toyed with my reputation because she never cared enough to read a book to understand what's actually going on, yadda-yadda-yadda, but today--this was one of the worst days of my life.

175960868,"FP, First of all wonderful news regarding your interview going well! Amazing job of not only getting through it, but doing so well that you feel confident about it! Secondly, I hope that a clear path becomes apparent in what you should do as far as your choices for employment go. I say don't worry about what anyone else thinks or says...and go with what YOU ultimately want to do. You will be the one working there for many hours of your week...and your happiness and job satisfaction are what matters in the end. Again well done, and sending positive vibes for a great outcome!

175960871,I bought 160 pieces of gum.
175960872,"Hello and welcome! I am sorry for the late reply. Kids just started school again yesterday, so I was not on the forum. Your concerns are certainly valid, so do not add to your already existing burden by thinking they are frivolous or appear to be vain/bragging. All the things you mention are things all of us have felt at one point or another, and are especially challenging for someone your age. Our thoughts can easily become negative when we are stressed, when we experience a rejection, or when someone carelessly makes a comment that hurts us. When we have negative dialogue in our heads, it increases our anxiety...and the anxiety can lead to more negative thoughts/feelings perpetuating a vicious cycle. What have you tried thus far to get relief from your anxiety? If you are just starting to seek answers, I suggest looking into our Resources at the top of the main forum page here for great self help material. I would start with the stress relieving exercises and meditations to help bring down your o
verall anxiety levels. We also have some sights specifically for social anxiety issues, as well as a link explaining how to use positive mantras to combat negative thinking. If you really want to make some effective changes, singing up for Moodgym (an online therapy self help program) is a great step! If you find you need more help than self help provides, then talking to your doctor about your treatment options would be the next step.

175960873,"I resonate with your last sentence. ""I seem happy but I don't know if I am."" One of the ways that I cope with my lot in life is learning. Learning helps me frame my existence, which gives me some relief. A german philosopher once wrote that what matters is not experiencing happiness, but deserving it. Learning that turn of phrase, and a bit others help me frame my situation. I think one of the best things for me was to take courses on great literature so that I can hopefully find a narrative that I connect with. And I one speaks to me, then I go to the library and borrow it, and dive deeper. This was one of the best courses by one of the best professors. Each lecture goes over one book, and each lecture is only 30 minutes. This professor knows how to tell a story too. He's got passion for what he's teaching. If you like this one, which is one of his best, there are many more by him. These courses go on sale many times a year, so I keep a close watch and buy them. However! Most good libraries are 
filled with them too! My library has 2 bookshelves of these courses to listen too. Their dope. If you like this one I can recommend more Life Lessons from the Great Books | The Great Courses Plus"

175960890,"Laid down to rest yesterday, twisted to look at the clock, reducing the blood flow to my chest, and got a little chest pain. Cut on the heating pad that is always plugged in and on my bed. The heating pad on my chest expands the blood vessels and the heart doesn't have to work as hard. After 15 minutes I was curious whether the heating pad had stopped the chest pain momentarily or whether it was going to still be stopped when I got up out of bed. The chest pain was not there. When you have chest pain during the day, can you sit or lie down and apply a heating pad? Probably with a pillow or two to keep your chest up. Your heart may be just telling you it's getting tired and it needs a rest. Does your chest pain happen when you've over-exercised? If I'm going to be doing the laundry that day, I don't take my 30-minute walk. I've learned the hard way, that's too much exercise for my chest. How did you deal with your chest pain when you worked? The doctors in your city are probably as well-equipped as 
any, as they exchange information on the web, in journals and in conferences once a year or so. So you're probably getting the best treatment there is. More On Anxiety Panic Disorders How To Manage Stress During The Holiday Season Reduce Anxiety Through Your Diet"
175960891,"Nice! It’s been a while since I’ve seen your art, are you feeling better?"
175960892,"That didn't go well. Ended up being chastised by the nurse for wasting her time on the phone saying that they had already told me these were benign and to take my medicine (even though my primary care doctor removed me from that medicine due to blood pressure concerns stating that if they are benign palpitations then it's more important to focus on blood pressure control than palpitation control.) So after some round and round, the nurse basically said she would inform the doctor that we talked, but insinuated that she wouldn't give her details beyond that. So now I am having dozens of palpitations an hour, and may have to try to find a new cardiologist as I no longer trust the professionalism of my current one.

Luckily when I drove by the house this morning, the house looks okay, and it's not red tagged or anything, just the garage looks like a total loss. I feel bad for the family that lives there.

175960898,"Her idea of the title is that loving the child and providing nurtance isn't enough (except that would be true with most kids in the system as well as any kid with mental health issues). The ""goal"" is creating attachment (she seems forceful about it though) - and addressing the often underlying cold homicidal rage within them - and addressing the behavioral issues that put them or others at risk (possible examples: stealing, destroying property, lighting things on fire, sexually assaulting others, trying to harm and/or kill people and/or animals, blackmail and other forms of intimidation, lack of emotional regulation, substance misuse and other high risk behaviors). I agree with your line of thinking As far she's concerned, a lot of ""enough"" seems to be about gaining control and dominance over them because they're 'bad' and need to be made 'good' ...... you might be starting to see some of the basis of my ongoing complaints around moralizing. ^ this approach isn't exactly effective for adult add
icts or people in corrections either, but it's commonly utilized in those areas too. I was searching for a free download of her book until I read through her blog and was too disgusted to search further. Though I might still read it in the future when I'm less emotionally reactive. The other part of the mind frame is about forcing bonding via ""hold"" techniques. ^ I won't even start on how invasive, disrespectful and retraumatizating that could be. She and other caregivers act like the kids are the ""bad guys"" and need to be fixed by the ""good guys"" = the caregivers. ^ I have enough experience to know that when adults start portraying children as more adept and powerful beings than them (as I saw some people imply in related discussion threads which others validated) it means they're plenty ###$ up too and just don't have the insight to recognize it. I read one excerpt, and from the way the 6 year old was described, you'd think the child was a criminal mastermind with a fully developed adult-functioning b
rain - or the psychiatrist was retarded - or that the writer was showing their own severe emotional immaturity and scapegoating the 6 year old. Funny what the vast majority prefer to believe rather than looking at their own behavior Complaining how ""manipulative"" the kids are is a terrible connotation to have connected with the youth because then almost everything they do or need they have isn't taken seriously - they're just ""manipulating"" All humans manipulate to meet their needs (behaviorism) - some just do it against the ""rules"" of acceptable behavior. Other trains of thought are more trauma informed - like where one addresses ""manipulation"" as trying to meet a need but there's either a lack of skill or a it's result of power imbalances or other forms of disempowerment. ^ and that all behaviors have a reason. ^ and that acting out is when people don't have the skills to deal with a stressful situation effectively. Lack of skills can be difficulties with emotional regulation, problem solving and ot
her forms of reasoning, changing tasks, social interaction skills, communication skills (like naming feelings or describing what's wrong or what they need), low frustration tolerance, the fact that a lot of kids with behavioral issues tend to have a naturally low-irritable mood baseline, etc. ^ and your perception of their behavior influences how you treat the kid which influences how they respond (Dr. _NAME_). Kids act out not only as a result of a variety of a lack of skills but a trauma emotional baseline is usually 6, 7, 8/10 (as opposed to 2, 3, 4/10), so they go over the edge a lot quicker. I agree with trauma-informed perspectives: with any behavioral problems in youth, instead of control battles and power struggles, one should focus on giving dignity, respect and offering as much control and choice / self-determination as possible, etc. < the more out of control they feel, the more legitimately dangerous they are (and rightfully so). The more comfortable and in control of themselves and their environm
ent they feel, the more they're able to come up with their own answers to their problems (positive psychology). My issue is that I can become ridiculously overly protective with any human which is also very unhealthy, so staying out of the way can sometimes be difficult for me and something I need to work on.

175960910,"_PERSON_ - I think the feedback you've received so far from MrALEX and art_PERSON_ are both basis are both valid, but the title of your post is a question (regardless of no question mark, smile I'm not a grammar Nazi, lol). First of all, you essentially asked a yes or no opinion question that's really has no right answer. At the end of the day, _PERSON_, only you can decide if it's worth trying or not. But without knowing any details about the nature of your severe depression, your age, some more things about who you are, how you see yourself, some of your background, your experiences in life, and current general health status outside of your depression and/or your living situation; no responsible person is going to give you a black and white, definitive answer one way or another, but I'll give it a try. Taking into account what I've just said, I think you should assess for yourself if if you think it might be helpful. Take a survey of yourself as if you had never met you before as any new Doctor, 
Therapist, or new acquaintance might. Do this before wasting any excessive time on the matter. Form an opinion about who you have been and who you are today. Just not some things down that you think might be a pro or con to consider it like any other medication or substance. CBD is a refined derivative, used by many for both medicinal and recreational reasons. Nothing is for everyone and never let anyone tell you that it's good for you or bad for you beautbecause they really don't know, including friends, doctors, or therapists. You are by far and away the best judge of that. It is what it is and you are taking initiative by posting and responsibility for yourself by asking questions to educate yourself. For this, you can congratulate yourself for and continue to ask questions of therapeutic support forums like Inspire, or friends or family you might be comfortable talking with about it more. I'll venture to say that because you a have what you describe as severe depression, that you want feedback as to wheth
er anyone thinks it might help. The answers will vary widely on the subject, and a CBD is not quite the same as other forms of perhaps more naturalistic ways of dealing with pain, anxiety, or depression. Personally, I'm not a fan. I've tried it for various reasons and decided it's just really not my thing. That's just me. My opinion however should not really sway you one way or another. It's just what I think, not what I could possibly know for someone else. That all said, I'm 48 as you could easily determine from my profile, no stranger to depression and much prefer smoking a little bit of the most mild marijuana that I can acquire in small quantities to roll a joint with once in a while and watching a movie or reading that I find to be a calming state and takes a little bit of life's edge off every 3 or 4 weeks or sometimes months or years. Could I recommend that to you? Of course not. That's simply what has been my experience. Really nothing more and nothing less. Call it a child of 70s thing, but the effe
cts of THC nor any stigmas attached to it have never been a big deal to me. My 78 year old mother tried CBD for both pain anxiety, and it wasn't her thing either, she lived through the 60s and 70s, and decided CBD wasn't for her either, no big deal. Keep in mind, CBD and plain old pot or marajuana are a little different from each other and not the same thing, nor is what their generally used for, why and how, and by who for whatever purpose. They are not interchangeable, but they can both have overlapping positive and negative effects, where in my experience, some have told me that a minor negative effect of either one is that it makes them a little paranoid sometimes for whatever reason, but again, that's them, not me. Generally, speaking though, it's unlikely tryinf either would kill you or make you some sort of addict. That's why you should approach it all from the standpoint of getting to know yourself as you might as someone else and make an educated decision. I hope this was helpful and that you keep in
teracting and taking initiative for yourself. You got this _PERSON_!"

175960952,"Because there is nothing to forgive, no mistake to forgive because you didn’t do anything wrong. You were the victim of abuse. We tend to make excuses to defend the abusers by saying that it was our fault that they abused us, because the fact that people we care about abusing us for no reason is unbearable. So we make those “reasons”, we try to make sense of their behaviors using a wrong logic to protect our feelings. I see you as a strong person, the only thing you lack is a correct type of therapy and supportive people around you. If I can recommend, try to listen to some podcasts about how to heal a childhood trauma and how to love yourself. Be your own best friend, parent your inner child, be someone you wished were there when you were a child"

174349432,Catatonia is a severe episode of schizophrenia. The only way you would know if you were in a catatonic state is if your psychiatrist told you about it. You really can't diagnose it yourself.
175960962,Yeah... it's hard to argue with them. Like a broken record sometimes. I've calmed down right now. My stepdad texted me and said he was sorry and he was having a bad day and that he loved me. I still feel like **** but I don't expect it to go away anytime soon.

175960965,"AClore, At a couple of points over the years, I was taking lots more, something like 200 mg at one point, but as I worked with my psychotherapist, my needs changed, and my psychiatrist and I decided it was worth reducing the dosage gradually to see how I did. I was very fortunate in that Zoloft was the only drug I tried'cause it worked! I've been on it since 1993. I have had no long-term side effects, and the only side-effects are a slightly increased appetite."

I think because I spent a lot of the past year struggling with a depressive episode."

175960980,"I'm hoping the nursing home won't confine us to our rooms again. The Coke machine hasn't been restocked so I don't know what I'm going to do. Without my daily sodas and vapor there's nothing much else to do. My smaller pair of jeans is getting a little baggy on me so I must be losing more weight. I'm certainly trying. I need my old blotter so I can color. I have a book full of intricate designs. I don't want to tear the pages out. If I ever do it.

It definitely has its fair share of _USER_ID_ applied to its use and whether it’s a “legitimate” medication, I personally know from experience that if I don’t take it I’m a ping pong ball jumping from one thing to another without ever getting anything completed. All of us understand it’s difficult in itself to have these diagnoses applied to our psyche and when there are individuals who delve into, what appears to be, the depths of darkness to rationalize why an individual may be experiencing something it becomes that much more difficult.

175960983,"I grew up in a mostly happy home. But some are not so fortunate. Years ago, I was reading a self help book about how adult child abuse victims can try to cope. Unfortunately, many adults who were abused by their parents while they were growing up think it was all their fault that their parents treated them so terribly. They don't think it was their parents fault. However, the author/psychotherapist who wrote the book said that if your parents abused you, it was because they were bad parents. Good parents would never abuse their children. Good parents would never do that to their kids. I thought that was excellent advice. If you were abused by your parents when you were a defenseless child, it's not your fault at all. And your parents weren't right either."
175960984,"I’m not sure. Probably from thinking about the surgery and about the no contact from the immigration yet. I keep thinking what if things don’t go as planned. The anxiety makes my sleeping schedule worse, I’ve been sleeping from 9-10 AM to 3-4 PM. Then I woke up feeling too tired to do anything and not doing anything makes me feel useless and that triggered intense self criticism too. Simply put, my own thoughts took the best of me. I will feel better though, just gotta ride these feelings out. Thank you for asking"

175960991,I’m not still thrilled by the trip. My grandfather is in a nursing home and I don’t like going to those places. Imagine spending your whole life to have it end in one of those places. The drive itself is noneventful. Most of it will be long stretches of highway. We will see how it goes. I’m dreading tbh.

175960994,"Y'know the way I said that I always feel better after a mental breakdown? Well 2 days ago was one hell of a mental breakdown.. But I still feel much better after it. It's likely because of the injection though making me feel better. I'm not going to drink coffee anymore - The Vyvanse is enough. I felt anxious today so I took half of a Valium - Felt the muscle relaxation that it is known for. I can probably take the Valium every second night which will last 3 weeks and then stop. Then I will be able to sleep and won't get any impending senses of doom. I feel way more confident in my chemical usage - Like I know what I'm doing and don't feel out of control. I'm able to think more clearly like I'm completely fine right now. I'm so happy. I think wanting to be independent has really motivated me because I felt like I was stuck and would be with my mom forever.

You are too. I can't have a baby though unfortunately - Then you think about physical illnesses - What a mess. You know how to organize your time better than me.

175961001,So lonely. _PERSON_ is taking off a week. Next week. I actually thought about starting a mental health-ish twitch channel but I’m scared of video. I’m not like I used to be. I thought maybe I could talk about emotional wellness or self care while gaming casual healthy positive games like Animal Crossing. One lady has a mental health channel called Make Up & Mental Health. She has a huge following.
175961002,"I took 100mg of CBD (Most I ever took). I usually take 40, 50 and 100mg. My anxiety is gone. Hopefully it will last for work tomorrow. I'm gonna get up at 7am and then I have to be at work to start at 9am. Not sure what to expect - With the placement of everything. I'll probably have to stand in certain places and not stand in others - Maybe a certain way of washing the dishes, prep cooking, COVID rules, something to wear, etc.. I just hope that I don't get too anxious. I'm nervous about it that's for sure. Hope everyone has a good sleep/morning. I'll let you guys know how my shift goes.."

They have daily AA meetings listed in the paper. Also a couple NA mtgs. I only see people getting help after having a run in with the law. I've helped alot of adolescence in the community who's parents are alcoholics, my home became the safe place for many of them. I've also helped them with a place to stay when they were older and needing to get into a placement themselves. I see alcohol being legal as the worst thing society has ever done. It ruins familys, causes violence and car accidents. Sometimes I think of moving to a dry county."

175961057,"Yeah I thought of smoking weed yesterday but I've learned from past experiences that that's a bad idea.. So I didn't.. It just takes a while for me to learn. I have low dose mush capsules but I'm gonna wait until my depersonalization/derealization is gone and I've learned more about meditation/spirituality - This may be a year or two. I'm incredibly honest to everyone in my life about these things. Ketamine nasal spray would be good because it worked in January - March of last year. Idk how good I was doing last year but it was better than this year. I was having psychosis when I lowered the Invega Sustenna injection to 4 weeks but it's back to every 3 weeks now again. So far my meds are keeping me stable and I'm very cautious about what I do now (Because of the bad trip making me fear death so much - I hallucinated a skull and crossbones, maggots, scorpions, spiders, etc). So far so good. Eventually I'll move to the west coast of Canada and can have a nice environment and be able to go to school. 
I told my doctor about ketamine and he said that one guy in town gets infusions but he wants to check with my psychiatrist to make sure that it's a good idea. I can't get a hold of my psychiatrist but will try to again this week. Ketamine doesn't harm me because it's just a dissociative but psychedelics do."

175961079,"That’s really awesome to hear! The main thing to do is keep rotating through a variety of foods. This way you don’t get tired of particular foods in your diet, so you always want to finish your snacks and meals if it’s something you haven’t had in a while. Some people even say that 3 big meals a day isn’t as healthy as having smaller meals (4-5 recommended daily) more frequently/snacks, so don’t stress about only having 2 meals. As long as you’re fueling your body between your meals, that’s all that matters. You’ll need to work towards 3 daily meals, but that won’t happen on day #1. I’m really glad you’re happy about your accomplishment, it’ll make your mood and health a lot better when you’re eating more to fuel your body. It’s so encouraging to hear what a breakthrough you’ve had with this. Thanks for sharing xx"

You also have Ativan tranquilizer for short term problems. Don't you need an anti-depressant if you have major depression? How close are you to a mental health clinic? You need to get under the care of a psychiatrist. verywellmind.com says about major depression and panic disorder: ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Depression and Panic Disorder"" ""Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one form of psychotherapy that has also been found to be an effective form of treatment for depression and panic disorder. ""CBT works by altering one’s negative thoughts and behaviors to reduce depressive and anxious symptoms and to improve overall functioning. A combination of CBT and medication is the typical treatment option choice for panic disorder and depression."" ""It is possible to have 
panic disorder and a co-morbid diagnosis of clinical depression; these treatment options can address both conditions.""

My psychiatrist doesn't recommend any of them because they are untested, but which of the above two suggestions are you recommending?"
175961104,Thanks for your response minnesota. I've come to the conclusion that the main reason why I would consider/take medicine is to alleviate my physical symptoms. I think if I were to think like that instead of that I need something to change the way I think or how my mind is maybe I'll be more inclined to go make an appointment with the psych. There's just still a part of me that's scared of course and that's what keeps me from picking up the phone.

175961120,"I was watching a Vsauce episode about FEAR. There was a woman born without an _USER_ID_ (The part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety). She literally can't feel fear but they hooked her up to a carbon dioxide tank and for the first time, she had a panic attack. So the best way to strike fear in anyone is to give them carbon dioxide and make them think that something else is doing it (Because people can relax if they know that it's safe). Then I think about AtypicalDisaster and her not feeling fear.. So I Googled ""_USER_ID_ and sociopathy"".. ""Psychiatrists and neuroscientists are making extraordinary advances in understanding the psychopathic or sociopathic mind, a mind that lacks empathy, compassion, fear, or remorse. ... But in psychopathic patients, these sections of the _USER_ID_ remain dark, showing greatly reduced activity or none at all."" Interesting! Then I think of Angelique67.. She feared the stairs greatly.. ""ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the part of the brain resp

175961136,"I had been anxiety free for 3 weeks, which was a record. Now I know it was naïve of me to think that I'd conquered panic disorder because as everybody says 'it can't be cured but it can be managed' but I really was starting to feel like my old anxiety free self again- I was even at the point where I stopped dreading bed time and could actually sleep. I'd been eating and sleeping well and couldn't have been in a happier place especially as I was finally feeling like me again and I was meeting a friend of mine yesterday. We were deep in the middle of a conversation (about an old school friend) when the panic hit me like a bolt of lightening, I felt the familiar intense fear flooding over my body and struggled to breath, it felt all over the place, my ears started to ring and my palms sweated. One voice was screaming at me to tell my friend I was about to die and the other was saying just stay in the conversation else she's literally going to think you are a lunatic. I tried to listen to my therapist
s techniques but it happened so fast and I felt like I'd forgot how to do my breathing excercises all together. In the end I managed to keep it from her and felt fine after, but it came over me for no reason. I slept badly that night with sleep starts, tremors and nightmares for the first time in 3 weeks. I know most people say don't dwell on why you get panic and reasons but I just feel very disheartened as I was starting to really make progress and for no reason at all it's just flooded back. I'm sad that I thought that I was starting to gain control and feel relaxed; hearing one good voice in my head and no battles with myself. It seems there are no patterns, trends or algorythms as to why, where or how my panic happen, it just came as a big fat reminder that it can't be controlled Everybody suffers from some kind of anxiety but not many people understand that I get it for no reason and the few people I tell try to understand by linking it to their anxiety which is most probably just worrying and then thin
k i'm just a worrier; I know this because this was how I used to view anxiety- I could never imagine people were plagued with such fear and panic especially for no reason- which is why I write to you guys because as caring as people around me are, you understand more. When panic comes over me it feels almost like I've fallen into the upside down in The stranger things and life is the scariest thing in the world. Can I control it or does it control me?"

175961140,Im talking with my 4th pdoc over the phone tomorrow. I had been without one for 4 months. Mental health centre keeps telling me to be patient i have been without a case manager for 2 1/2 months after my case manager went on _NAME_ leave. I have been sick now for almost 2 weeks. At first the er doctor thought i had pneumonia so gave me antibiotics which i had an allergic reaction to which could have killed me. I got tested for covid and it came back negative. I sleep most of the day away with this cold. And wake up at weird times in the afternoon. There was one day the day before i went to bed at 9:30pm and the next day woke up at 5:30pm. Covid has begun its second wave and they talk about how the results are high meaning its that day but its old news when it takes 2-3 days before you get results. My friend is being funny she told me at first she is sick of covid but then freaks out that i might have covid. I dont understand her anymore. I try to inform her about what's going on in the world but all 
she wants to talk about is the opioid crisis. I bought these cool lamps at first the person only had one made then told me i would have the other one in two days which would of being the 30th of October. i didnt get the other one until November 3rd. They even even were so nice enough to tell me that others were looking to purchase that one. I gave them a bad review on fb markerplace. They told me they had a day job which i thought they only worked 5 days a week not 7. Turns out we knew each other through another a person. I felt like i was screwed around and they didnt practice proper business etiquette. I have been awake 2 hours but i am still exhausted. I have a zoom meeting at 5pm which is in an hour. Which i see a counselor that i pay $20hr out of pocket. The provinical government here gave an extra $300 since March. As a covid supplement. On disability and welfare income. We are waiting on election results to see if they got back into power. To see if the $300 will be extended into the new year.
175961141,"Anxiety is hard...I find consistency helps so if every Monday I goto the grocery store and every Wednesday I do X I get less worked up about it, but I still get a certain amount of anxiety. I have notecards that have encouraging thoughts like I may be experiencing anxiety but I can do this anyway. Mostly I have those in my car in case I have issues driving. Basically I push through the anxiety and feel better on the other end. If you don’t do the thing you feel worse all around and it magnifies your anxiety. As far as the depression it sounds like your taking the right steps, you’ve just gotta keep doing fun things regularly."

175961148,"Abstract> Identifying state-sensitive measures of perceptual and cognitive processes implicated in psychosis may allow for objective, earlier, and better monitoring of changes in mental status that are predictive of an impending psychotic episode, relative to traditional self-report-based clinical measures. To determine whether a measure of visual perception that has demonstrated sensitivity to the clinical state of schizophrenia in multiple prior studies is sensitive to features of the at-risk mental state, we examined differences between young people identified as being at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 37) and non-psychiatric matched controls ( n = 29) on the Mooney Faces Test (MFT). On each trial of the MFT, participants report whether they perceive a face in a degraded face image. The CHR group reported perceiving a greater number of faces in both upright and inverted MFT stimuli. Consistent with prior work, males reported more faces on the MFT than females in both conditions. Howe
ver, the finding of greater reported face perception among CHR subjects was robustly observed in the female CHR group relative to the female control group. Among male CHR participants, greater reported face perception was related to increased perceptual abnormalities. These preliminary results are consistent with a small but growing literature suggesting that heightened perceptual sensitivity may characterize individuals at increased clinical risk for psychosis. Further studies are needed to determine the contributions of specific perceptual, cognitive, and motivational mechanisms to the findings. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-021-00156-1?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+npjschz%2Frss%2Fcurrent+(npj+Schizophrenia)"

175961170,No I wasn't offended I appreciate your reply and info
175961171,I’ve developed anxiety over showering ever since I started working from home last year. I’ve talked to my psychologist about it and she gave me some advice but it’s hard to follow sometimes and I let slip. I don’t know why it’s such a thing. It seems dumb to be anxious over showering.
175961172,"Yes, yes I did."
175961173,What do you mean by a promotion?
175961174,They are! I agree!
175961175,"Adrenaline was keeping you awake. But remember, Inderal doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier so it does nothing to your brain. Just slows the heart a little and blocks adrenaline so you'll feel a little out of energy but you'll get used to it."

174349689,"I'm doing well today. I had a pile of packages on my coffee table. Like since September. I finally opened most of them. And then I felt motivated to do housework. My back aches a little bit but it's not too bad. I still have energy. I want to try to vacuum the one section of my carpet that is clear. Then I'll call it a day. I swept yesterday. Eventually, I'll organize."
175961181,"I don't want my mom to die. I teared up when I saw a picture ""All mothers were summoned when _NAME_ called out for his momma"". But anyways, I can't leave here. I need help and I went on reddit and people are taking advantage of the same news for their benefit. The news will change to something else like it always does because the thing is; I do the exact opposite of what other people tell me to think or do. I've always been that way. ' My sister is manic. It's freaking me out. I don't know if she's taking an SSRI and everyone's lying to me. I don't know what's real. I looked down a powerful ice cold water canyon today and Possible trigger: felt like jumping in. It was like 50ft deep. It was so powerful luring feeling. My mom was there and got me away from it because i was just staring I started to get derealization so I took 7.5mg of olanzepine and diazepam. I don't like being the same as everyone else and I like to be completely authentic and true to myself. But everything is so annoying. I have 
a literal mental pain in my head when I try to think - and it's NOT a headache.. Although I've had a headache today.. I took 1mg xanax because my veins were big - I'm afraid of the olanzepine messing with my heart and the chocolate. I need a place to study and be quiet and stress free. My mom is telling me to find a job if that would help me. I don't feel normal stressed. I have severe dementophobia; ""The fear of madness is generally known as dementophobia. People who suffer from this fear are afraid that they are going insane or losing touch with reality. The fear may be triggered by a family history of mental illness or periods of severe stress."" I don't want to end up in the psych ward because they'll change my meds. People aren't normal anymore - I'm afraid that people are being violent and primitive revving their engines and such, completely out of control. I don't find things funny at all sometimes. I don't take things seriously. I have no morals - Just convictions that are so strong i know they are b
ad but i don't know who i am anymore."
175961182,Can you pm me a link or tell me where to find it? Also congratulations ?

175961187,"Desoxyn, are you going to get a job and move out? Seems like it would help a lot."
175961188,"I have certificates on web development and accounting but I don’t use them for my job. I decided to go back to school for a BS in applied math. Maybe I won’t even get a job in that field, but I want to improve myself. There are jobs within my company that do require a math degree so I’m aiming for those. But I’m not putting too much pressure on myself. A lot of jobs don’t really care what your degree is in just that you have some kind of degree."
175961189,"This is the type of stuff I write in my journal every day (I write a ""theme"" in one line for what the day represents and find a picture on google images to match it); ""Universe going against me I lowered the phenibut to 1.1g today. Here’s my phenibut taper; Friday 3rd January 2020 - 1.1g Saturday 4th January 2020 - 1g Sunday 5th January 2020 - 900mg Monday 6th January 2020 800mg Tuesday 7th January 2020 700mg Wednesday 8th January 2020 600mg Thursday 9th January 2020 500mg It feels like the universe is going against me. Not being able to wake up without Vyvanse due to the sedation from the Seroquel, my sister texting me “_PERSON_ the walkway” and then my mom phoned me to “_PERSON_ the walkway” so I did. It was hard because people kept walking on the snow and compressing it into the side walk - Then the shovel broke. I was so warm so I had a cold shower. I didn’t want to do it because I was afraid that I would get high blood pressure. I then had to borrow a shovel from my moms work an
d the maintenance guy said “Bring the shovel back” as if a shovel really matters. If someone borrowed something of mine, I wouldn’t give a ****. It’s like my step dad saying not to eat food in his 150k dollar truck and when I think about it now, I have flashbacks of setting his truck on fire. I shovelled the walkway barely and left it cuz it’s gonna snow again anyways. Now I’m going to clean the litter box for the cats and clean the dishes which I do for my mom and sister every day. It’s constant tasks that need to be done all the time - No break for being able to think. On top of that, I realize that to live in this town, you have to have a job so I immediately called the employment centre and booked an appointment to look for a job on Monday the 6th of January. I can’t sit around and try to become a millionaire anyways because the lack of stress makes me slack off (My ****** cognition doesn’t help with that but my psychiatrist basically said that there’s nothing that she can do about tha
t and I’ll just have to accept it). My therapist said that I seemed anxious yesterday and I said that I LIKE being anxious because it keeps my mind active. I need to meditate more soon and that’s what I’m going to do. My psychiatrist said to stop researching pharmaceuticals and psychedelics and look up math and physics courses online to see if I’m good at them - considering that I think about physics all of the time which can lead to some sort of psychosis cuz I’ve heard that some people study physics so deeply that they go “insane” and I believe that it’s true. But I need to look at everything positively and that the universe is working in my favour or else I’ll just be miserable. Thinking the opposite of that way is why I’m sure people get addicted to partying and alcohol and being ****** to people. I’m not that. I’m a positive person."""

175961196,"Hello there, I have been exactly where you are, and I ended up leaving school because of it. It just became too much for my body to cope with such high stressors all the time. It’s something not many people can understand because it’s not something. I ever wish upon anyone. Honestly, I take it one day at a time. And one thing at a time now, because the alternative is flare ups, pain, and tears, all we can do is take care of what we do have, for/however long we have it, including our physical bodies. Everyone deals with this sort of thing in their own way and at their own pace, because well its a lot to digest on any given day. I’m not going to sit here and tell you its easy, because its not, but you learn so much when you have so little. Focus on what makes you happy. Do right by your body. Listen to it. Write. Read. Walk. Do something good.. for you."
175961197,"Yeah, Vyvanse helps in the morning. I take it at like 4 AM but then I've been sleeping most afternoons that I am not working. Like maybe I need another stimulant after noon or something. But since I'm sleeping to cope with life, then I don't know what I would do."

But then it was past 7pm.. and I was feeling an empty restlessness... So I measured 50mg of CBD and kratom, put them into capsules and swallowed them.. I then realized that I didn't take the olanzepine yet.. So I swallowed all of these at 7:40pm. I lied down until 8:30pm (50 minutes) and had a deeeep mind rest.. I got out of bed and felt even worse.. Like I was going to have a panic attack.. So I put 0.25mg of clonazepam under my tongue (I never took any in ~2-3 weeks), then ate Eggos + cereal.

It is probably annoying. I got a few hours' respite by drinking a cup of passionflower tea. It has the effect of temporarily reducing my anxiety and making me a bit sleepy. I was so grateful for the relief. But then it wore off and I was back to being an anxious mess -- very angry at myself and worried. Do you have a psychiatrist? Why are you not on an anti-anxiety medicine?"

175961227,"There, at least in Colorado, is a really easy way online to make yourself into an LLC or whatever you want, but I think that doesn't really matter unless you're like a multiple-person business because it shields liability in some way if you have a business. You could make a trade name. I made that a while back for my DJ business, haha. It was just like 20 dollars or something in the state of Colorado to file a trade name. Making a trade name would probably be the best option, but if you don't care, it's not really necessary. I don't really know the legal implications of this."

175961242,"You can trust Tweaky (He just wants meth). Finland is like Canada. Safe place to be and everyone is just trying to look out for you. Soon you'll be on the right meds and feel much better. The thing with psychosis is I don't even notice when I'm sick or if the meds start working. But you'll start to trust them again eventually. Psychosis is a horrible thing. Wouldn't you just prefer if it was hypomania? Thatd be great! But you probably don't even sense pleasure or humor. People in the psych ward I've noticed seem to glorify ""craziness"" which just makes it scary as **** to be the person listening to them. I don't know why they do that.. The chemical soup in your brain is signaling ""PSYCHOSIS"" like a drug induced psychosis. Change the chemicals, and you'll be better. Sometimes psychosis can be caused by environmental factors and it's either, it will get better, or the environmental factors cause chemical imbalance and the psychosis just stays that way. But no one is trying to harm you. Theres no c
onspiracy. It seems like there is. I think things like my mom is a spy which is quite heartbreaking but I'm glad that I'm out of that state and trust me, when you're out of that state, you'll think ""Why was I even thinking those things??""."

175961245,I just wonder why is it a month cold turkey. Why not try reducing slowly? You’d had a better chance of succeeding. Maybe reframe it instead of going cold turkey of no social media to limiting to an hour a day and block off time for other activities. It’s a pandemic and there’s not much for real life socializing so you need some outlet and lifeline of support and you’ve admitted in the past of this forum being helpful. There’s nothing wrong with some internet usage. I just don’t want to see you disappointed or isolated. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175961246,Usually my pharmacy is pretty good with everything. If they kept Latuda 80mg in stock then we wouldn’t have any problems at all.
175961247,"Omg I'm so proud of myself. I talked to the property manager about getting an emotional support animal, cause there's a certain form I needed for my doctor to fill out (which she agreed to fill out) anyway, she said she'll leave the form down at the front desk later for me to pick up. I was so nervous for some reason I was almost shaking. But I did it!!!"
175961248,"Phenibut alternative is Baclofen to taper (10mg 3x a day) Or (If I get high blood pressure tonight), Xanax alternative is Valium to taper (10mg 3x a day) It would be much easier if my doctor knew what Baclofen is and if he's ever used it on people for alcohol withdrawal. He probably hasn't and it takes a long time to get a psychiatrist appointment which is why I'm playing doctor with myself. I'm just tired of people judging me every time I put myself at some sort of risk. I don't mean to do it. I just want to be happy. But I've learned my lesson. As long as I don't get high blood pressure tonight I'll be happy. But nicotine in nicotine gum also increases blood pressure so I have to chew less nicotine gum. So I'm just going to distract myself for now."

175961253,"Hello There are a lot of poor therapists out there, and it can take a while to find a good one. I can tell you that with certainty. When you see a new therapist you might try treating it like an interview, and see if they are able to meet your needs and if you feel a connection. After all, you are paying them for their abilities to help you. But I know that takes energy and that can be difficult when you are already depressed. I fight the same battle as you do, with little will to go on at times. Sometimes when I feel that way, I simply do nothing. I stop trying to figure out my problems or analyze myself. I just exist in the moment and let myself rest emotionally. You sound like a kind person. I think compassion will find you, it is probably already there for you."
175961254,"I have suffered with anxiety on and off all my life… I am now 72. I have had a debilitating fear of health issues, doctors, testers etc. for many years but up until now I have basically been pretty healthy. Now I am convinced that it’s starting to change and I have to get into a doctor and find out exactly what’s going on. I am crippled with anxiety and fear over this upcoming doctors visit, knowing my blood pressure is still very high even though I’ve been on medication and I know it’s going to lead to many other tests s and my fear of having something terminal is paralyzing me. How does one fight through this planet fear that I have. Sometimes I think it would be better to find out then suffer with the anxiety that I’m suffering with right now but when it comes right down to it I’m scared to death to make that step. Any suggestions on conquering this horrible fear and anxiety?"

He paid it off with his last income tax return and maxed it out again. 2. We have to pay more now which couldve been used to pay off other things like electricity transfer fee etc. Internet, etc WHATEVER. Soooo, we are gonna end up paying a deposit-like price to move. Even tho this new apt doesnt have a deposit. We wouldve only had to pay maybe 800 to get in there. Around there. Now it's almost 1200 with all the fees tacked on. And that's not including paying the electric companies transfer fee and possibly a internet transfer fee. He spends wayyyy to much money a month on smoke. That's why it pisses me off."

Because freaking out about these thoughts IS the psychosis... Y'know what I mean? If I had these thoughts and I was calm, cool, relaxed or excited with people that thought they were ok, I wouldn't be considered as psychotic.

175961306,Yes I did but not the fish oil yet.
175961307,"I used small doses. It helped, but made me tired. Gave me a feeling, too, akin to thc. No paranoia or hallucinations, just a super relaxed feeling. I probably just associated it with thc and felt uncomfortable. Last time was last summer I took it. Ever since then I've been fine. No additional psychosis or anything. I wouldnt use it for psychosis particularly tho. Maybe anxiety or an extremely stressful situation. When I took it when I was extremely stressed it was very, very helpful. But if I had taken it when I had mild anxiety, it made me too relaxed. Which i didnt like. But personally, I am not a fan of being uber relaxed. I think because I've been on my toes since I first had anxiety when i was a kid. So I'm used to being overly cautious, on my toes, on edge, etc. It keeps me aware and grounded. When I get too relaxed, like on xanax or the like, or even cbd, I feel scared, because i feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. Only because my personal reality is being super, super, super on my toes 
and hyper aware. So I may be the exception to the rule."

I told my mom and sister today at the ski hill that reality is an illusion and that they're not real. That's horrifying. Olanzepine helped a little bit..

I remember telling the principal in high school that I wanted to Possible trigger: walk in front of a truck There was nothing even wrong with my life. Like who does that? Someone who's obviously severely mentally ill. This happened before my ex step dad came into the picture. But I feel like my my childhood ended when my mom said ""I love someone else"" (Other than my dad). It was very irresponsible and reckless of her. She has Histrionic Personality Disorder - People like that are in denial. She knows what she's done to me by being in a constant state of alcoholic destructive ecstasy - But she gets mad when I ""blame"" her. 
It's not my fault that I feel this way - Neither is it hers.. But I'm just trying to express why I'm feeling the way I am. I analyze all of it. And the analyzing thing is constant. I'm always looking for meaning in a way to feel better. I need to be able to set my mind to doing low dopamine things but this dose of Dexedrine isn't enough. I'm going to ask my doctor for more. I don't want my brain/mind to deteriorate. I told my sister that I wanted to take too much shrooms again to cure myself at the risk of her and my mom having to take care of me being forever psychotic - It just slipped out of my mouth. So saying that makes me not want to do it at all because it would be my fault in a way. My illness makes me interested in certain self destructive things more than someone with schizophrenia without obsessive autism. It all killlssss mee. But I'm going skiing again tomorrow.

But I think while wrapping, the package might have touched the outer plastic and since me and my mother touched the package, we might be exposed to the virus. The next 14 days will be excruciating for me due to this, every moment giving anxious thoughts. I know the chances of this happening is infinitesimally small, but I cannot let go of that thought.

I just spent the last 5 days scaring the crap out of husband and teenage son And 80 yr old mom with my paranoia and mania. Part of it was not taking meds for a long time, then starting new one inconsistently and at high dosage. lack of insurance played key role in my drama. As well as not being employed and being stuck home with depression."
175961316,"Hi! I am sorry to hear you're having a hard time. I myself know that hearing it will get better and that it's only a phase does not help. You probably feel stuck in the moment, and trying to look to the future for better times might feel impossible. Being told it's a phase often made me feel belittled about my feelings, as though they didn't count because of my age. I would suggest that you get in touch with a local crisis line or help line. You don't have to be in crisis to call. In my experience, they are very understanding and patient, and can guide you toward getting the help you need, even if your family doesn't support you on this very brave endeavor. My anxiety and depression manifested heavily as a teen, and the hormones and my family life made things even worse. When I moved out on my own and had my own life, some things got better, others got more complicated, and some things, honestly, got worse. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life and at times have felt totally cons

175961320,"This thread is....a trip and a half. I always find it really interesting to find people so put out by their 'relationships' with schizoids, just because I work so very hard to avoid having any personal relationships at all. I understand with other PDs how things might linger and get malignant, but it seems like it would be a fairly easy thing to avoid 'abusive' behaviours from someone who isn't actually interested in maintaining a relationship by just also avoiding the relationship. Maybe a little difficult if the schizoid in question is a caregiver, but.... I am intrigued as to how these relationships happen. Avoidance - Yes... I like the term exposure. Yes, I want to limit my exposure to er....everyone. Belittling - More when I was younger. Hardly ever now. Except maybe bullies and narcissists. Oh, gosh, it's so much fun.

Depression - Maybe sometimes. Dissociation - I think I know where to find reality when I want it. I think my dissociations are all intentional little mental vacations. The description for this one makes it sound unintentional. Entitlement - I have not much if any. Escape to Fantasy - Yes. Feelings of Emptiness - Maybe? People make me feel empty. Alone, sometimes, I feel full. _PERSON_ - No. Identity Disturbance - no. Imposed Isolation - Hell yeah! Just on myself though. Y'all can do whatever you want. Invalidation - I....don't think so. Sounds insidious. Lack of Conscience. No. I have so much conscience. I am annoyingly blessed with it. Low self-esteem - Ehhhhhh. No. I don't think so. Masking - Oh yes. I'm too truthful to do it very well, but I absolutely mask myself so as to not horrify others on a regular basis. N
eglect - I have no dependents but it's hard for me to fulfill the emotional needs of my family members. ""Not my fault"" syndrome - no. Objectification - no. Pathalogical Lying -- other than to get out of social events and interactions? No. Projection - I don't even know how that would work. It's pretty clear to me that I don't have a substantial overlap with the feelings of others. Selective Memory. No. Selective Competence - Yes. Great tactic to keep people from taking advantage of you. Recommend 100% Stunted Emotional Growth - Probably. In terms of relationships...yeah, I think I am unable to move further. In everything else, I think I do grow. Tunnel Vision - When I am stressed yes. It can be an effective coping mechanism."

I found that using water based paints for a while was a good exercise as there is a limited time and less room for error. Would LOVE to try my hand at using coloured Indian ink one day. I became lazy and apathetic. Did a graphic design course, hoping I could create beautiful art without mush effort/fuss. But it is harder ( technologically), more time consuming and rarely measures up to 'real' art. With my co-workers.. I think ( although I despise what they represent) I don't hate them as individuals enough to sketch caricatures. Also Cartoon drawing is so friggin hard. One has to come full circle , emerge the other side, and masterfully chose and exaggerate salient features. People often mention I should go to this or that art exhibition. I never do. Its a strange thing but rather than inspire me, the work of artists triggers other emotions such as a little jealousy and a sen
se of hopelessness that talent alone is never enough. One needs to become fanatical, driven, and passionate! Portrait painting would be my favourite theme if I could only muster up some passion. Just finished up reading about _NAME_ and looking at his work. I really like his art. I have been wondering if, with his shading and light contrasts, did he just 'wing it' or really knew from a physics point of view where the light should fall.I mean would anyone know if one just highlighted with light what they felt like highlighting instinctively? ... .hmmmm.."

175961350,"I'm new here. I have been aware of my depression and mental health issues since I was a teenager. I've been to therapists and have been prescribed medication to deal with my mental health issues. I don't think I've ever had a therapist that was the right fit for me, and as a teenager I was given medication from a psychiatrist that cared very little about me and more about writing a prescription to anyone. I have always wanted to get married, have kids and be a teacher. I have all of those things in life but feel lonely at times in my marriage. I solely take care of my 2 year old daughter with little support from my husband. My husband has mental health issues as well. He deals with anxiety, depression, and ocd. We are similar creatures of habit, but we deal with our social and emotional well beings very differently. I do not communicate my needs, wants and frustrations with him. I do not like confrontation, and bottle my emotions up until I become passive aggressive with an attitude. And he, coming 
from an abusive childhood, has to be in control and verbally lashes out when angry. We have had marital problems from the beginning, but nothing ever changes. I don't know why I do some of the things I do that are an issue in our marriage. I don't listen to him when he speaks sometimes, and sometimes do the opposite of what he asks. He tells me what he needs from our marriage but I find it difficult to reciprocate when I feel disrespected by the hurtful things he says when mad. From the very beginning I saw red flags, but the connection I had with him trumped those feelings. The last time I was on medication was in the beginning of our relationship, about 5 years ago. I went to therapy last year, but it cause so many problems in our marriage. I've tried to go to counseling with my husband but he refuses, saying that all of our issues are my fault. In therapy last year I tried to deal with some of the issues in my marriage, along with my own mental health issues. I became more vocal about the things I disliked 
in our marriage. I ended therapy because of how many arguments we were having over it. I am open to different ways to deal with my issues, but I feel medication is the last resort. I didn't like the way medication made me feel, and I'd rather not while taking care of my daughter. I love my daughter and husband, I am thankful for my life and health of my family. I am trying a support group to see if this helps. Anyone else having similar feelings? Or have any advice to offer?"

175961373,"command /bin/bash returned exit code 1 class=""content""> If it doesn't bother you, don't worry about it. You're aware of how you affect other people, both negatively and positively. That's enough. You care about this issue enough to make a post about it, but if you ruminate over it too much, you'll create a problem for yourself where none exists. I could relate to most of what you said, and although I don't think you stated your age, know that it took me many years to be comfortable with the way I am. I think many people with non-destructive personality disorders need to just grow into them and accept themselves. You don't sound unhappy, so don't push it. I've found that while most people expect some kind of return when engaging in any kind of relationship, some don't. If you suspect you may be needlessly hurting somebody by simply not caring, don't walk away. Let them make that choice. Friends can come in handy at times, even if they're not truly friends from your point of view. Yes, sometimes yo
u have to put on your mask and play the game. Needy, clingy types will see through that, and you won't have to be bothered by them. Over time you can pare down your acquaintances and friends to those few who are not overly expectant and tend not to exhaust you just by being in the same room. The fact that you feel comfortable around your brother verifies to me that schizoids prefer familiarity. I've had a lot of people moving in and out of my life but the two who have remained thus far have been around for many years."

I thought we might be talking visiting him once a week and listening to a few stories. But he lives with you. Whoa. And you mentioned, ""we agreed."" So, you didn't think much of him to begin with and then you invited him to live with you. If you didn't like him, why did you agree to let him live with you for the rest of his life? I guess the wife, but were you all in agreement with that? How does your wife deal with this situation?

175961415,"Another question about SSRIs, as I struggle to figure out what to do. I started Zoloft at 25mg. That is almost surely not a therapeutic dose, but I wanted to start low to deal with side effects, since the only prior time I tried an SSRI (8 years ago), I had trouble tolerating even a pretty low dose (of Lexapro).. I took the 25mg for 9 days and then switched to 50 mg. I am on day 18 at 50mg. I cannot tell whether it is doing any good, since I do not know what I would be like if I were not taking it. But I don't think it is doing much good. It is, however, messing with my sleep. (Maybe to some extent the anxiety is messing with my sleep, but I think the Zoloft is mostly to blame). For the first two weeks, I took a low dose of Klonopin every night, to help fall asleep. But I stopped doing that because I don't want to take any risk of getting hooked on Klonopin or any other benzo. Now I can fall asleep on my own, without a pill, so I guess that is progress -- but I wake up too early (like 530 am or so) 
and with a very uncomfortable jittery/agitated feeling. The p-doc suggested I try taking the Zoloft pill a little bit later in the morning (I was taking it around 8; now switched to 1030 am or so). He said early morning jitters might be a sort of withdrawal symptom, as the amount of Zoloft in my body is reduced. So if I take the Zoloft a bit later in the morning, the jittery feeling might happen a few hours later the next day -- like 8 am instead of 530 am-- but by that time I will be up and going so it won't impact me much and I might not even feel it. I tried that yesterday for the first time. I had a very interrupted night of sleep. I slept very lightly and was up a lot during the night. And still woke pretty early - though to be fair I also went to sleep pretty early. I will try this again today, taking the pill around 1030 am, and see how it goes. The doctor also said if this does not work, I could try splitting the dose and taking half in the morning and half late afternoon, in an effort to keep a more 
steady amount of the medication in me. It seems like there's no way to predict what will work, so they just make up every different option to see what might work. I feel like a lab rat. The doc also said he thinks I probably need a higher dose than 50mg of Zoloft, since 50mg does not seem to be doing much for me. But he understands that I will not go above 50mg until I can address the sleep issue that I am having with 50mg, because I have to assume that increasing the dose will only exacerbate the sleep problem. At the same time, he said we may conclude that Zoloft is not the right med for me and maybe switch -- as I mentioned in a prior post -- to Paxil. But I think Paxil might have worse side effects than Zoloft, and the cross taper can create its own side effects, and Paxil is reportedly harder to get off of too. So I am not sure I would do the switch. I would probably instead just throw in the towel. so to speak -- stop taking meds, and instead try to address my situation solely through therapy (I have a 
very capable therapist). I don't know how people deal with all the medication side effects, and sleep deprivation, agitation and jitters, and switching from med to med, etc, all without any assurance that any of it will do any good. It sometimes seems like the cure is worse than the disease! I would welcome any advice you might have. Thank you."

We love each other very much and we talk a lot. We have decided together that she should move here in with me which is a big thing in itself bcuz its half way across the country. My worry is my disabilities and mental health issues she will have to live with here with me. I have a back disease and arthritis really bad in my hips. It makes it hard for me to walk, its hard for me to get up from seats and especially the toilet and it makes it hard for me to do basic everyday things. I treat them with prescription pain medication. My mental conditions and illnesses I also treat with prescription medications. I do get by but I do have help with things. My girlfriend might have to help with these things when she comes. I love her and am worried it all just might be to much. She does know all this stuff but I'm worried it will be har
d on her. I was in good health when we first met and had a good job and a great life. I'm not saying my life is horrible now but since then I am fully disabled. What does everyone think? I'd like to know people's honest opinions. Thank you"

175961422,I think I may need to come off the topamax. Looking back I started it in January and ever since then the panic attacks and hallucinations have been 10 times worse. It was a few weeks after I started it that I ended up in the ER because I thought I could feel chemicals going through my body/veins burning throughout and killing me.

It was mostly the olanzepine and two shots of wine that stopped my agitation and put me to sleep. I ended up falling asleep at 4-5am. I was lying there this morning in bed and said ""I'm not taking the vyvanse"" and would just rather have a dull understimulated boring day or just sleep - But I couldn't.. I started to get really bad akathisia so I had to take it. Now it's almost 4pm and my day is wasted, I can't call my therapist or make an appointment with my psychiatrist. It's too late.

175961449,"Hi _PERSON_ and welcome back! I don't have personal experience, but have heard many similar feelings expressed from members who are trying a new Rx for the first time and have concerns. While there can be some unpleasant start up effects for some people, not everyone experiences them. Also they are temporary and often end up being a small price to pay for a medication that after a few weeks, can give you years of benefits. This is of course a personal decision, but consider your quality of life with anxiety. Is the possibility of some side effects more uncomfortable than the other option of living with the anxiety as is? Of course only you can answer this, and I am not trying to sway your decision...just giving you something to think about .

175961458,"Thanks for this information, I really appreciate it. As far as growing up in a positive household, I would say it was kind of a hot and cold situation. I have many fond memories with my family and grew up in a loving environment, but my mother put significant stress on me particularly about my school performance which was generally always pretty good. She had very high expectations for me which I normally met, but would get irrationally angry if I scored lower than what she’d like. My freshman year of college is when I had a steep decline in my performance. I was drinking a lot and abusing drugs and not focusing on my education. While I don’t blame my mother for being concerned, she started to suffer panic attacks and sleeplessness of her own. She was not open to therapy and opted to take Paxil which did help her. However, she explicitly placed the blame on me and my behavior for her having to go on medication. This was a particularly turbulent time, but as a whole I believe I grew up in a posi
tive household. Although looking back it seemed contingent on me meeting expectations. I haven’t spoken to too many people about my current struggles with my mental health except for my parents and girlfriend who I live with, but they have been supportive."

175961475,"Just exploring. I want to go Vegetarian like 2 days a week. But problem is my parents do most of the cooking (like 99%) and it's meat and potatoes. Meat and noodles. Meat and rice. I can't get them to go vegetarian except I did succeed last Sunday. So I figure if I get a couple of cookbooks maybe I can try to do some cooking on the weekends when I am off of work. My parents cook because I work and because we are stuck in Parent/Child mode even though I am more than grown and because my parents see me as ""sick"" but I think I'm doing better so I want to start learning how to do more stuff. So I did buy two vegetarian cookbooks and one was a _NAME_ one! Recommended by someone else on My support Forums!"

The pain was as fresh as it was a year ago. The emptiness, the sadness all back at full strength. Can't concentrate at work, put on a false faccade in front of friends, family, coworkers. I have been told all my life how strong I am when inside I am falling apart, so I keep up the front...don't know how else to act....been ""acting"" since I can remember. I am grateful for the years I had with my son, but also sad for what will never be. I wish I could have told him how proud I was for the man he turned out to be, for the best son a mother could have ever wanted for. He was my best friend, my confidant. He never judged me, always listened to what I said and was truthful. He had such excellent work ethics, would help anyone, a complete stranger if needed. He was okay if you didn't see eye to eye, he knew we all had our beliefs, our dif

Earlier in the day I tried benadryl then my klonopin and nothing was working and I was hallucinating so I just gave up and took it. For some reason I didn't have the RLS or agitation I was getting before, maybe because I was so damn tired or maybe because I elevated my legs and kept the room cool with the AC, but I'm continuing to take it."

175961547,I don't miss voices but I'm interested in the fact that I had them. There's a psychedelic drug called Diisopropyltryptamine which makes you hear voices constantly for 3-6 hours. There's also another drug that can make you hear voices for two weeks. But I'd never try them. I already had that experience without drugs.

175961552,"Thanks for your kind words. I have some rare extra time right now, and honestly it feels good to be of comfort, and I empathize with what your dealing with alone. This so much for you to bear alone, I agree that you need more support. Holding in devastating things is very hard on a person. When we hold things in, we put up barriers between ourselves and others in order to protect ourselves. And we can end up isolated. _NAME_ questions are helpful as far as helping us figure out where you are and where you might get more of what you need. Your original post cried out to tell your mom, but it sounds like that may not be possible? Sometimes we don't get the support we need from our parents, but the action of asking for what we need from a therapist acting as a parent can be a release. The therapist can give you that feeling of having your pain acknowledged by someone really important to you, like your mom, as you might long for. In the short term, _NAME_ a buddhist teacher, does wonderful talks on tru
st, compassion for ourselves, and working through pain. (Free podcasts and videos). Meditation is also a great tool for releasing pain, and _NAME_ offers guided meditations too. There are some little tricks to comfort yourself, like hold your hand over your heart, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and say things like ""I'm here for you"", ""I love you,"" or ""I'm so sorry"". In this way, you can offer yourself comfort and support. It sounds a little hokey, but it helps. Another weird and simple trick that helps is aura clearing: Wash your hands and comb the air with your fingers around your head and torso saying ""I am free, I keep only what serves my wellbeing, and I release what doesn't. "" And then wash your hands. It sounds insane I know, but it is strangely uplifting. I wonder what you think would help you? What would reinventing yourself look like to you?"

175961558,"Newt, I feel you. The reason the love of my life and me parted was because after I paid all the bills I didn't have enough to vacation or spend money on luxuries I couldn't afford. I worked my *** off just to survive and lose everything else. It's the sign of the times though. People get paid way less than they are worth compared to the babyboomer generation. That generation is the only generation that not only received a booming economy but didn't pay it forward to the next generation like it was handed to their generation. They ****_NAME_ us with a 7 dollar minimum wage, sent jobs to other nations to make a nickel extra, look to wallstreet to make more for shareholders instead of their laborers. Don't even get me started on their climate change denying. It use to be that federal workers were the middle class, but when _PERSON_ denied federal employees their earned money, that SOB, showed that even federal workers were living pay check to paycheck. For a teacher who has a college degree, their inc
ome hasn't been given a raise in 10 years! They often start out at 28k, which isn't even survival money. . _NAME_ (whom I am voting for) and _NAME_ are asking for a $15 minimum wage, but I'd like to see a maximum wage. No CEO on earth deserves a 15million a year bonus for doing nothing but raising the price of insulin so people can die."

For me it is connectedness and respect of the long termers who have supported me on many a few. I still post for self support when needed. In this day n age a go to of hw is invaluable. Wether it be regular or not. Some do actually hang because of many a friendship..genuine friendship on forums they post in. A lot come n go...some just read more than post heart forum. What you have shared is good stuff and relevant. Anxiety related disorders are a complex business. As you know. I see hw support as people who live it...something a doc usually has not.

174350224,"I'm gonna read one of my books for a bit. It will be more interesting while high. I know one podcaster that likes to read when he's high. That's what I should do for drug recreation is to just read books while eating weed gummies. It's harmless. I don't have much meaning in my life. I think podcasts, music, family, my future and past and the world is what gives me meaning. Also spirituality, self improvement.. I guess that's a lot of meaning.. I think really tuning into the idea of ignoring anhedonia is the best cure for negative symptoms.. and people must know what they are and not accept that people are lazy and all the things that are wrong with humans. But in a tribe, no one really cares about the lazy person.. they just make fun of him/her but still show love. I think that's kind of a flawed motive or product of evolution. But then that's saying that people shouldn't do drugs. People that love the law and are sucked into societal reality. So Idk what I want."

175961583,Hi what wrong? How old are u ? and are you an male or female?
175961584,"Minipuff: You say, “do you think my agitation and excessive outbursts are anxiety related? I've always thought it was just bc I didn't work harder to control my emotions.” You know, I don’t really know, but in going through all of this stuff, as you say multitask, trying to take into consideration what you said in your first post, then your second, then your third, etc., and then what the net says Prozac is (anti-anxiety), what the maximum dosage is for that, 40 mg and you’re taking 60, what patients have said about how they deal with their panic attacks, since you’re reaching out for those who have it, how to deal with medicine phobia, CBT (positive thinking since it’s helped me so much, from reading a column in the newspaper by this woman who explained positive thinking in 10 paragraphs, mainly think positive before you go into a problem that you can solve it, which gets your unconscious onto positive, while it may be negative since you can’t see it, it helped me a lot and I try to 
tell as many people as I can), and I’m copying all of that, and trying to put it together. So I guess that’s one form of multitasking. But I can’t concentrate on what I’m reading or watching on TV and keep up with what somebody else is saying. Your mind may not be as sharp as it was. Mine is not. But, again, you say, “do you think my agitation and excessive outbursts are anxiety related? I've always thought it was just bc I didn't work harder to control my emotions.” I may have lost track of your mention of anger, etc., that, what with all the other. But what I attributed the anger to was, like I mentioned my bipolar, I had a lot of anger. When I went on Lithium for bipolar, it reduced by 90 percent, my anger, and my anxiety. I think “agitation and excessive outbursts and anxiety” are all part of one illness. Just as with bipolar, I have basically all of that, and Lithium dealt with all of that. When I used to drive, I would be on the lookout for other drivers who did not behave the way I thou
ght they should, and would become very angry. When I was a passenger, I would notice the driver in my car, and wonder how they were so calm and did not notice things like that. It was because they didn’t have bipolar. So I’m thinking your outbursts could be basically the same thing. Your illness notices and intensifies, we’ll call them minor transgressions, by others. Like myself, if you could get on the right medicines, I think you would notice a world of difference. It would lessen your anxiety, anger and intensity. You don’t know it now, because you’ve never been on the right medicines. You might be there, or almost there with an increase, if you take your new anxiety medicine, Buspar. You never did answer my question about possible negativity. Was the household you were raised in, negative or positive? Mine was negative. You may have learned that growing up and you don’t know it."

It's as if he's killing himself. It's a little sad that he hasn't empathy for people very similar to him. But it's realistic I guess. And the father, who teaches his psychopathic son, that it's okay to kill psychopaths... idk, what could _NAME_ think? It's like if he's learning: ""for my father it's okay to kill people like me"". It's true that he is different too, as he doesn't kill innocents... But it's complicated."

175961596,"My severely psychotic shroom overdose trip and all the stuff I've went through in the hospital, psychosis, drugs, panic attacks making me think a about death so much, turned me from a complete atheist to a pantheist and now i believe in God but not some man in the sky and I'm not religious but i have love from my family so i think that I'll see everyone in some place. Like life is a test. I never thought I would be that type of person. I'm not religious (Cuz those are made by man - I believe that it's what ever the individual person believes. People learn lessons so just be a decent person cuz karma is real so what goes around comes around) but I'm spiritual and have truly finished creating my own religion. It will morph for the rest of my life but I now know the laws and rules. The paradox. I met a crazy person. He said ""the paradox"" and I've been posting about the paradox for a while now. Lyrics in music and _NAME_ (A famous philosopher) saying the only thing you need to know about the deepest 
fundamental secrets of the universe is that for every inside, theres an outside. Reincarnation is real. All religions are true if that's what you want to believe. You dont even have to believe in them fully. My mom and I were watching a white fox being helped for a sinus infection on TV and they were pumping the foxes nose and had to flip it over and it got heart arrhythmias. They tried to save it but it died. Me, being logical was like.. they wont let it die on TV. But it happened. My mom cried and I gave her a hug. It was making her anxious and she took an ativan. I said ""Do animals go to heaven?"" And she said that she believes that because she knows that they have souls. She said when she dies before me, she'll be waiting for me and that we will all be together and with my grandfather. My brother graduated from the police thing and my grandfather was one of the best cops in Canada awarded for a lot of things. I thought about the soldier telling me to kill myself and I should have said, ""Have you ever ha
d a loving family, like what is wrong with you? Why do you go to other countries to risk your life? For fun?"" Cuz he did boast about killing people so I guess he's just wrong in the head. I just want to understand him that's all. I dont understand why people are the way they are which is why I like anthropology. But anyways.. w/e.. what you see is what is real.. but in the end, it doesnt matter if someone is in one place and someone else is in another while they're they're in different realities at the same time.. in different universes as multiple universe theory is real. It just matters as we are all one. The same energy. I've gone very far in what I know. To manage my emotions, feeling and actions, to manage my mental health and life. Someone just asked my for a dollar or something. I have nothing in my pocket. I assume he's a drug addict and would have given him money if I had some because I cant change his life. I could but I have my own life to manage. He will figure it out. If he doesn't, then that is 
sad. It's not sad if he's a drug addict. That's the thing.."
175961597,It’s hard to explain. When I’m on the medication there’s these thoughts I can’t access. They’re blocked. But now I can hear the thoughts I understand all the truth that was being hidden from me. I know it’s all a conspiracy.

175961621,"I feel like I need to just find a new psychiatrist. I've just had some stuff recently with this psychiatrist that makes me not trust him too much anymore. The stuff is that I didn't tell him about a med switch I had made and I didn't tell him that I had sought a second opinion at first, and then I told him later, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. Then he keeps pushing for making changes to my meds. I am not saying I am absolved from guilt about this, because sometimes I tell him I feel flat on these meds. And if all were perfect, I would be able to go down on these meds. I feel like the pandemic has negatively affected our relationship. That is because we have these brief video check ins and he always ends up making some sort of switch that I'm not happy with at the end of those. I just need psychiatric care that makes sense! I, like some others on this board, research meds a ton and I know what makes me feel better and what doesn't, so unless a doctor can convince me of a med switch, 
I am not going to comply. This psychiatrist has not explained the switches he wants to make well. He always ends up trying to convince me with an explanation of the neurotransmitters that are involved, and I always just glaze over at that point because I don't care. Then again, I know that this current med combination is probably too much, and I want to make changes, but not in the way he is doing it. I have difficulty tolerating any discomfort."

I also have a chronic pain condition and the Cymbalta also helped well with that so I think it's a good choice. The only downside is it's a very hard medication to discontinue so a very slow taper is required. I hope you find something that works for you keep us posted. _PERSON_.

Plus, the abuse to you from your wife will increase 10-fold because she knows she has you trapped. And she'll turn the child against you with candy, money (yours) and no rules: no bedtime, no get up time, no doing the homework, no going to school. Plus, the longer you stay the longer you increase the chances of her getting pregnant because she can implore with something like, ""I've always wanted a child."" Or, she can just ""forget"" to take her birth control pills. Also, she needs a child for long term companionship, for if you ever figure out what's going on, 
you might bail, but the child will always be there. You're at a crossroads right now and can get out of this. You're already living at another house, and you're making all the money, and she's treating you like a dog. I think you're getting some clues here. You think you're in a bind, but you can get out any time you want, you're financially and mentally able to do that, and you have no children. Lot of people would pay good money to be in your situation with a borderline. I wasn't able to do it. I had bipolar, difficult to keep a job, no finances to move out, a child. I'm living through you. I'm hoping you'll leave that situation. You've got it figured out. Consider this a test. Not of her, but of you. Of how positive you can be that you can solve this problem."

175961697,"I like fall colors too. And I like being able to wear scarves and beanies. Being from Southern California though, it's not cold enough for that yet. We still have temperatures in the 90's. Usually snaps cold around Halloween so we'll see if that happens this year. I did just buy myself a new beanie on Amazon Prime day so we'll see if it gets cold enough to wear it soon. In my religion we don't celebrate Halloween but we recognize that other people do. So usually we do a ""Harvest Festival"" (Which is really just another name for Halloween in my humble opinion) and do a trunk or treat to give the community a safe alternative to traditional trick or treating. A trunk or treat is where kids go from one decorated trunk to another and collect candy. This year that is cancelled because of Covid-19. But I bought myself my first Halloween decoration this year. Just one. A little black pumpkin that sits on the tower of my computer at work. It says ""Happy Halloween"" on it in white lettering and has pink, o
range and green stars on it. It has a glittery stem. I don't know...it just makes me happy!"

It's not very healthy anyway and I shouldn't be eating it. I hadn't eaten it in maybe a month or two, but with everything going on I chose to. Well it was all we had too."

174350411,"I dreamed I was going to be the first person with schizophrenia to be on the moon and I was scared about take off. I barely slept last night. went to bed at 2am, woke up at 5 am, off and on for the rest of the night. I had ream chip beef on toast for breakfast, with apple cider."
175961704,Anybody seen crazy delicious on Netflix.....such a cool show!
174350410,"This is a new symptoms. Im not diagnosed with schizophrenia, even tho I had transient psychotic episodes that put me in the hospital. I have BPD only. I'm starting to hear voices inside my head recently (a few months ago). I remember last year there was a period, before my hospitalization, where I started to hear thoughts in my head, they were voices with diferent personalities. Males, females....But after months they went away. Now I hear voices like they are thoughts. They come from my mind but I don't think them, they appear automatically. I call them voices even tho they are not auditory. The weird thing, they appear only when I'm with others, in social situations, it's rare when I'm by myself. I don't know why. So when I'm with others, I start hearing full sentences, that make sense. For example, I was getting a massage yesterday. When I entered the room I suddenly heard voices. These voices mimicked the lady that was massaging me. For 50 mins they didnt shut up. They say things like ""how are 
you? Im fine. Bad weather today. "" etc so neutral sentences. In rare situations they are negative, like ""kill yourself, kill others, kill"" but very rarely. Tomorrow I'm going to see my psychiatrist finally after months. I'm afraid of telling him this. I'm afraid he'll say I have schizophrenia. I dont know how to start this conversation. I dont know why the voices appear when I'm with others only. I'm starting to isolate myself so I dont have these voices all the time. They make me feel anxious, and very distracted."
175961705,"My man isnt home. He decided to stay one more night at the cabin. I took this picture just now. His nightstand would have his fan, to cool him off during the night.

175961706,Went for another walk to a place where I did a small run then walked back. I will do this every evening and run more and more every time. Tomorrow I see my doctor for Vyvanse refill then I'll go get a gym membership. He will be glad that I started exercising. I don't feel panic this time after running like last night so I don't need to take a benzo. I slept 15 hours last night though. I'm on a 3 day water fast starting 8PM May 26th - Sunday to 8PM May 29th - Wednesday. I will drink just water. (I will fail at this). Then I will do 2 hour exercise at the gym on Thursday after I eat Wednesday night. I will feel so good to be healthy and not smoking either. I will be an adrenaline nut.

175961724,"Hi guys. I had a T appointment yesterday. It went well. We talked about the SH and about the Hallucinations Possible trigger: sometimes I get hallucinations of children hanging themselves. T told me to think of Jesus and _NAME_ going behind them, getting them down, and holding them/cradling them. I think I can do that. I feel pretty good today but the innermost part of me feels a little panicky. IDK if something in T yesterday set off some terror, but I'm just noticing it on the very inside of me and it's a bit terrifying really. I like T though. She wore black flowers in her hair. I told her she's like _NAME_ in Wonderland, which I meant as a compliment and she took as a complement. She told me a story of _NAME_ coming to visit her when she was quite small. It was really neat. I never had that happen, though I'm pretty sure I had an angel come help me out when some guys tried to rob me once. Because they got this terror stricken look on their face and high tailed it out of there. It was bewilderin
g but also kind of neat. I have a PCP appointment later which I'm a little worried about but I don't think that is what the panic feeling is about. I think it's just normal anxiety about the PCP appointment. T gave me a lot of good things to think about. And I see her next on Aug. 9th so that's not so far away. _PERSON_"

175961727,I haven't been on here in forever. I have a question. has anybody ever eaten coconut oil straight out of the jar and had it irritate your throat? I did this last night and it made me cough and my throat was instantly irritated. Now I just woke up and my throat is still irritated with a scratchy feeling and I'm having anxiety about being sick now when I know it's just from the coconut oil. Just hoping it's not an allergy to it. I also drank roasted dandelion tea afterwards so now my overthinking mind is wondering what's going on with my throat and if the tea contributed. Ugh. drink this tea before though I don't think I had a problem. I've always had a throat anxiety. I've googled it and other people have had this issue but they don't know why this one article said something about the low acidity in the coconut oil can irritate the membranes of your throat which doesn't make sense. The article seems kind of off but other people have had this issue. Doesn't say why though. So have any of you ever had 
this happen?
175961728,"I just need to share this somewhere because if I don't tell someone then these thoughts will keep me up at night. I'm not happy with my life right now, my job is filled with people waiting for me to quit, and my family are counting down the days till I become ""another school dropout"". I wish I can hurry up time so I can finally enjoy my last years as a old lady living away from society, but at the same time I am so scared of dying alone. I'm even more scared of my memories slowly fading away from me as I age. . . . Sorry for sounding depressed but I needed to share ;;;"
175961729,"I really have no idea where to start. I have a physical disability known as a right-sided hemiplegia/ right-sided hemiparesis as a result of at least one year of intense physical abuse when I was between 2 and 3 years old. Due to the disability, I have an abnormal gait and used to get muscle spasms which have improved significantly since I had a baclofen pump installed in early March 2020. Although my physicality has significantly improved since the operation, I still struggle with issues of feeling worthy of anything (love, attention, happiness) even from my fiance who I literally love more than life itself. I graduated from high school in 2014 and have been struggling like crazy with college, which wasn't even my choice, to begin with. I've been working towards a degree for the past 6 years with no tangible sense of meaningful progress. The reason this is such an issue for me is that growing up I was constantly in and out of hospitals, but when we got home there wasn't a lot that I could physical
ly do to contribute. I have always felt an overwhelming sense of duty to go above and beyond for other people's sake but never my own, I don't know how to want greater things for myself. And typically, society looks down upon those who can't contribute, regardless of the individual's personal circumstances. I feel that I have internalized these values which makes it nearly impossible for me to forgive myself when I make a mistake or fall short of others' goals for me. I start to hate myself and wish that I was dead because for me, being dead is more favorable than being a living failure incapable of change, due to an overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety whenever I try to step out of my comfort zone. I know that this is important to at least practice because you never know what you're capable of until you go through the pressures of trying something new. I used to be very willing to try and push myself but for the past few years I haven't been able to go for a simple drive or walk around my college campus w
ithout my muscles locking up and feeling like my heart was going to physically explode, I get that nervous. I don't mean to blame others but my family really hasn't been as supportive as I would have hoped. Instead of gradually trying to calm me down they constantly tell me to ""get over it, it's not that bad, I'm making a mountain out of a molehill"" this really doesn't help when I'm having a panic attack because they're looking for a quick fix so they don't have to deal with my problems. They also never try to empathize with my struggles until I choose to tell them how bad things really are (me wanting to kill myself). This is extremely painful for me because I don't know how to calm down, my mom never taught me how to cope with difficult feelings, it's always been: ""You're too weird, I don't feel like dealing this, shut up."" I have learned that I can't rely on them so I turn to quick fixes such as marijuana, alcohol, and cigarettes. Due to my sense of anxiety and fear, I'm afraid to try anymore but at th
e same time, I still feel like a literal ""absolute"" failure. This has led to a deep-seated sense of self-hate and confusion as to what to do next, I feel like there's nothing more that I can do. Which leads to thoughts of suicide, I'm upset about being disabled and not being able to experience the world in ways that many others take for granted, and while I'm able to have good days, most of the time I feel like I'm a burden to everyone who I feel has had the misfortune of knowing me. I don't like getting wrapped up with other people even if we both benefit because I worry that they will lose interest in me because I'm always so upset. This makes me feel terrible because I feel like I'm neglecting them, when in fact they are my lifeline. I don't like the idea of me constantly being codependent on others because I know that will stifle what little sense of self that I have left, even though I have no idea what to do with it. I'm only 24 and I've gone through 4 therapists in the span of 5-6 years, had nearly 2 
psych admits (for the second one, this was about a week before my baclofen pump insertion and I got scared that they wouldn't let me out in time so I lied and told them that I made a mistake and was fine while still in triage.) And while all but one of my therapists were very good at their jobs I'm still struggling with feelings of not wanting to exist and thoughts of suicide are slowly creeping back in. I know that my friends ""love"" me and my fiance would be devastated, but there aren't any reasons that I can find for myself to stay around. My life feels like torture because I'm constantly stuck between wanting to die to free my mind, staying around for others, and being afraid of what's on the other side of life if anything."

174350450,April is one of the hardest month for me cause april 5 1992 was also on a Sunday where my love was killed by a drunk driver 2 weeks before prom thats why i dont drink today tammy had a lot of friends that all promised that they would always remember her for the first 5 years a few kept that but now the only ones that goes to her grave side is me and her mom and dad not a day goes by without me thinking what if ??? 6 weeks after that i lost my son to sids and 12 days after that my brother shot and killed himself people dont know about what i say and do and the and they dont understand the shit ive been through. Only God knows why. I am bipolar schizoaffective if you have been reading some of my post i post ever so often ive had a few people message me but im lucky to even be smart enough to even post this. Ive been through a lot i hear and see things that no one else can i talk very fast and a lot of people dont understand me its just i have a lot to say sometimes other times i say nothing at all. I 
have found that listening to music helps a lot with the voices but not always ive been on a lot of meds but none have ever taken the voices and the demons away. Yes i have bad days and good days sometimes i feel like giving up by than my wife makes me go to the hospital she knows me very well. All i can say is you need someone thats knows when you are not yourself and before it come to the point you dont want the help its a very fine line. I live on the edge everyday and i have to pull myself off it not that i am afraid of death its just ive never had a cry for help all my attempts would have ended in death if someone didnt save me ive come so close 5 times that my funeral is already paid for by my dad . So i do know all we want is the pain to stop the voices seeing things just to stop but some of us meds just dont do that i have to work very hard dont get me wrong the meds im on help but dont make it all go away

I shared that her spirit that came to me at conception must have known I was anxious and scared during my pregnancy and that had to contribute to her multiple stress and depression and anxiety over her years. Please for both your sakes, do some great therapy that helps support you moving through the anxiety at this time while you have a chance to make some changes or learn some techniques that can help to unwind when you do get triggered.

My experience is that my family knew that I was not my normal self and that I was experiencing symptoms of mental illness. Of course the nurses knew this as well. My family knew the kind of person I was any other time than during episodes so they were very forgiving. I find people’s ability to forget other people’s difficulties is rather great, as they are more preoccupied with their own insecurities and misfortunes. Please love yourself and know that you are worthy and a wonderful person."

174350514,"Ok so investing is going to be my main thing for now. But I also want to watch educational videos a lot.. I want to know things like what exactly internet waves are and a little coding and if time travel is possible and how it could be possible.. _PERSON_ imagine connecting to future internet waves.. There's so many waves.. And psychedelics are key to subjective proof of infinite universes.. Many things are possible. And I want to know about experiences, to read books.. Not enough time it feels to know everything.. But with marijuana, I can focus on small details for longer.. It's helping a lot with ADHD... I'm gonna go back to my physics course tomorrow maybe.. I have to make a time.. i want to learn.. I want to go to school and know everything... Yet there's so much information on the internet.. The only drawback is that I have to improvise my learning.. And I'm not very good at improvising (Due to autistic ADHD).. But I'm getting better at it.. Yknow that philosophical question of ""If a tree fa
lls down in a forest with no one to hear it, does it make a sound?"".. I believe it does as long as it is discovered.. Someone to experience it (Yknow like how reality doesn't exist if there's no one to witness it?).. Cuz sound waves could be detected if they are distinguished by everything else that exists.. Which is the observer.. Telling another observer.. But what if someone anthropomorphizes a thing? Is that what everyone is doing to each other? Is it me?.. I can't think that of course.. I can't be God.. What deters me away from that thinking is discovering that we are ourselves, each other and as one. The only thing saving me from solipsism now is that other people in my imagination are solipsistic which makes them God too to me. That's a very profound discovery for solipsistic autism/schizophrenia - Now I can be at peace for continuing on the path.."

The child is in a bad environment, but you’re not in that environment. 3. Her mother is trouble also, and you’re going to be outnumbered, 2-1. 4. Your affect on the child will be zero. 5. All you’ll be is ground chuck, preferably male, something for them to chew on. Everybody else is steering clear of that house. Wonder why? All they need is for somebody to walk in. Why not you? 6. She doesn’t want to be alive, but we don’t know what the dx is or what meds she’s taking or not taking. And she’s still hollering at the child, showing she’s not on the right meds, but won’t discuss medicine with you. Use her male child as a weather balloon: If you move in, that’s what’s going to be happening to you. 7. You have depression, and are going to go to a psychiatrist, which is good. 8. What do they say: Looking 
out for number one? That would be you, not her. 9. If you have the strength, I think you should stay away. If you are alone and have problems, the temptation could be to go towards her, even with her problems. I was in a similar situation with someone who had huge problems, so I have an idea of what you are going through. 10. I hope you can find the strength to avoid this difficult situation. 11. In a way, it’s lose/lose. You may feel like you lose if you’re alone, and you lose if you’re with her. But I think if you can get positive, positive in general, positive that you can make it without her, you can get through this."

175961805,"Thanks so much for sharing. Just reading through your writing helped me today. I struggle with severe anxiety, especially social. I feel that paralysis in social settings, it is so uncomfortable. I really like what devante_nspire said - that considering how many years you have been pushing, shows how strong you are. I have often thought of 'escaping to the great outdoors' and how that will fix all my problems. I'm about to move to Colorado, partly in hopes of this. And we'll see what happens. But a comforting thought to me has been that people struggle everywhere - even in the most beautiful places on earth. You are definitely not alone. Being in the woods and feeling connection to the trees and plants and animals all around can also be comforting - we ARE all connected. We've been taught that is a cheesy thought, but it is really beautiful to me and helps me with reminding me of a purpose. Thanks again, I hope the sun is shining one of these days wherever you are. If that's comforting for you.. it 
is for me"

Have an awesome day. TimTam- The world will never be perfect, lol but it's not as bad as we think either.

175961813,"Do you know the other med options? I've been going through the ringer trying the best one that suits me but its difficult still. My doc thinks it's dopamine that is causing slight mania. It was a realization when I found out how many of us here are having sleep issues. So the options are antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and then the stuff which builds tolerance like a long half life with a benzo (I take Restoril). I take Benadryl all the time because nothing seems to work. The most common med is Seroquel because its so potent an works on two fronts: 1) it decrease dopamine 2) it is a central nervous system depressant. I'm sorry you're having trouble with this. Sleep depravation torture is what they should call it."

Exercise your human mind as fully as possible knowing that it is only an exercise. Build beautiful artifacts, solve problems, explore the secrets of the physical universe, savor the input from all the senses, filled with joy and sorrow and laughter, empathy, compassion, and tote the emotional memory in your travel bag.

175961831,"My first serious side effect of what was labeled anxiety by a variety of doctors was the feeling I could not take a deep breath. Various doctors just ruled it anxiety. I had a variety of tests, allergy, asthma, lungs etc. Finally the allergy doctor said she thinks it could be vocal chord dysfunction. She sent me to an ENT who in turn let me see a speech physical therapist who put a scope down my throat. She could see that my breathing was the issue. I spent months learning how to breathe properly. It did help. I have to remember to breathe properly. That said, I still get that sensation of discomfort and I am aware of each breathe at times. I use Ativan now and then and it takes my mind off my breathing for a day. Check out VCD. Not saying that is what you have but not that many have heard of it."

175961833,"This sounds really tough. My son had a terrible problem with insomnia and depression and getting out of his head. A few of the things that helped him were being really physically active during the day so your body was super tired at night. Also yoga because you are forced to pay attention to the instructions and your body which takes you out of your head. There is a free program called doyogawithme. Google it and you can sign up for free and access all their classes. Finally, it helped when he had structure in his day and woke and went to bed at the same time every day and night."

175961837,"It all started with my mom offering to buy me tires. I told that story yesterday. Mind you, I didn’t have my AP for 1 day. Yesterday. I cried from 5am (when I woke up) to 1am (when I went to sleep) about the whole situation. Which she kept changing the story of what she was actually offering me. Asked me to get my dad involved by asking him to pay for 2 tires. Then my dad backed out because of their history together and the tires are expensive cuz I have a muscle car. (But it’s paid for and in great condition. So I am not selling it). Then I ended up backing out the whole deal. She kept calling me tho, afterwards a few times. Which I didn’t answer but once to say I no longer want her help. (She said some very nasty things about my dad which tipped everything off for me around 9am yesterday. I ended up transferring my sadness subconsciously to issues in dealing with, with _PERSON_. I cried about that and cried to my friend on the phone about my mom and my relationship. _PERSON_ had to catch me 
by the ear (not physically) and tell me that everytime I get involved with my moms issues/efforts, that i get in a bad place. He said I was doing fine this past week til she roped herself into my issues. _PERSON_ and I talked and talked and talked. He gave me a sort of pep talk with tough love. So did my old pss when this situation initially started 3 days ago (she seems to know my mom very well and how she does things. So she catches my moms bs early on). Everyone that knows my mom, don’t like her. Even some cousins of mine on her side of the family. Even my own grandma has told my dad (when they got together) to watch out for my mom cuz she’s crazy-acting and wild."

175961843,"I 100% agree with that. My smoking is very much routine driven. If I skip out on a part of my routine that usually involves a cigarette, I don't feel any desire to have one. On work days, I usually have 7. If I stay inside all day, I won't have one at all. If i'm in my usual routine and don't/can't have one...I fixate on it Nicotine actually helps one of my neurological conditions though, so I'm hesitant to cut down. I know I should probably switch to vaping, but...I ENJOY smoking. I don't really care about the early death thing, my body is so @!@@@! I can't stand the idea of living in it for that much longer anyway."

I’m grieving the loss of my mom’s best friend who my sister and I always called our second mom. Sometimes our second mom was closer to us than our own family. I broke down at the funeral and it was hard because everyone that has seen me grow up here in _NAME_ majority of them haven’t ever seen me cry but I was bawling my eyes out at the funeral. Everyone that talked from our community understood that our family was very close to my second mom. While I know that she’s in a better place and isn’t suffering anymore I just miss her so much because she was supporting me so much when I found out that my husband wanted a divorce and she knew that I didn’t deserve being treating like my feelings didn’t matter. I deserved to be loved and respected.

175961854,I opened the blind in my room and I felt a bit better. Less wanting to escape. I might go for a walk later after work and studying. See if my sister wants to walk to the store or something. I just feel like I’m dirty my face is dirty my hands are dirty my hair is dirty. The thoughts just make me anxious. I feel I have to compulsively clean clean clean. Over and over to be clean.

175961870,"I've been hospitalized multiple times. I've also been told that it's very likely it could be something that could happen again so I should be prepared for that. I've learned to look at hospitalization as just a part of keeping myself well. It's not a guarantee that I'll ever need to go back, but I'm grateful it's there if I need the help in a crisis. It has helped me to get back on my feet before and hook me up with the services I needed to stay as independent as possible honestly. Maybe you could even do a Wellness Recovery Action Plan or something like that stating what you will and won't allow if you're ever hospitalized. That may help you feel like you still have some control in case of a mental health crisis. In my experience the hospital really wasn't that bad. Some of my stays made me angry but not because of my treatment in the hospital. I was angry for just having to deal with mental illness, but I'm learning to accept it and deal as best I can. Honestly, though, most of my stays were quit
e pleasant now that I look back on it. Yeah, it wasn't ideal. However, I'm grateful I had a safe space to get help, get meds adjusted, and get the treatment I needed. Every time I was hospitalized I had to stay for a mandatory period of 72 hours (if I remember correctly). That was to make sure I wasn't a danger and o monitor my illness. I got my meds adjusted, talked to doctors about my symptoms, went to different groups, and I was generally well taken care of. The only thing I really hated was being probated. My stays typically lasted about a week or two to get back to functioning well. I haven't been in the hospital in almost four years though so I've made some great progress. The last stay was two weeks. One or two weeks seemed about average for myself and the other people I was with. But I think it just depends on the individual and what's best for them. People have been okay with me after hospitalization. My friends who were true friends were really supportive. My family was okay though we're not very cl
ose. I've gotten some people who've been curious but never rude and their conversations are innocent enough questions. I've found most people to be pretty understanding. I've been much harder on myself than others have. Except for maybe my grandmother."

These last few days have been rough, not sure if it’s the med, or the stress of my separation and also the fact that my hormones are all whacked out right now as I should be getting my menstrual cycle sometime this week. I’ve been feeling anxious again (mostly mornings) and slightly depressed. I honestly don’t think it’s the medicine, but I will continue to push through. From my past experiences with lexapro I recall having some anxious/down days after being on lexapro for a couple weeks but I pushed through and it went away but before I wasn’t going through any high stress like now. Thank you all for your support. Just wanted to provide an update!"
175961875,"It’s very true, I mean even now when I talk about my anxiety I see how others open up about their own and just realizing how relieved they also feel it’s very good and make me less anxious too"
175961876,Thank you _AT_MENTION_. I will pick up some Dramamine today when I go out. That will be a good backup to the zofran. It’s not actually heartburn. It’s muscle pain in the chest and idk what kind of pain in the stomach. Just a mess.

175961886,"Guys.. I'm feeling sooooo great. I went for 1-2 hour hike (Idk I didn't notice the time). Listening to music. Eventually I wasn't sure where I was so I went on a cut off and just started running down a hill for 5 minutes. I was also afraid of bears - But I passed two people coming towards me so that helped. I came back and checked my heart rate - While standing up, it was 143bpm and sitting down it was 114bpm. Now it's 93bpm. I took another shower. Everything around me is clean and organized. I had thoughts to write down. There's so much thoughts in my head and I can't organize all of them - I have to write everything down. I'm thinking of reading or researching things now. I might go for a hike every alone at least twice a week - Cuz I can't be around my mom and her friends anymore - They're too dramatic."

I’m not abandoning this place and I’m not abandoning you guys whatsoever."

He wouldn't tell my sister. I was taking medications out of my mom's dresser drawer and was swallowing them and taking THC. Then my dad wasn't sad anymore and was lecturing my brother about being gay. I said ""What does it matter about someone's stupid sexual preference?"" so I was like to my sister, ""Dad has a brain tumor"" and then the dream ended cuz I was sick of that shite.."

175961929,Wow between that and the crockpot you’ll have all sorts of adventures
175961930,"You say: “I guess I’m looking for advice from people who have been through this.” I’ve been through it. Along with my wife, I raised a child who is now grown and it was close to everything you said. One reason it was that way was because I was bipolar I (with full mania and depression, while net says bipolar II is depression but only partial mania.) For my bipolar, I take Lithium to deal with the mania and Mirtazapine for the depression, which has really helped me. We can be thankful that we have medicines that can improve out condition. My mother’s mother had bipolar during the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s, but they had no medicine for that and she spent much of her life in a central state mental hospital 100 miles from her home. Today we have medicine that works and that we can take at home and we don’t have to be at a state hospital with medicine that doesn’t help. We can be very thankful for that. As a parent, in addition to being bipolar, I was also not the disciplinarian. I was 
the roll on the floor entertainment center. I was also unconsciously negative from either bipolar, the negative household I was raised in, or both. I stumbled until a column that said, “If you aren’t positive, you probably aren’t a good problem solver.” It said, go into a problem thinking you can solve it. I said, next time I have a problem, I’m not going to think about the problem, I’m going to get the positive column down from the bulletin board and read it. The next problem was, my son comes in and tells me, “The car’s in the backyard and it won’t start.” I think, ""I don’t know what to do, how are they going to get a wrecker into our tight driveway backyard? I’ll wait till my wife comes home and she’ll solve the problem.” Then I remembered the bulletin board column on being positive, that I’m not supposed to worry about the problem first, I’m supposed to read the column on first being positive before trying to solve a problem. I get the column down and start reading it. By 
the 4th paragraph, I said, “_NAME_.” What was _NAME_? It was a small garage near our house that we had used before that had a small wrecker that had once before gotten into our twisting driveway and gotten one of our cars. How did I solve the problem, and I wasn’t even thinking about it? The column on being positive had opened my mind to solving the problem, rather than closing it to thinking I couldn’t solve it. So, believing you can solve your next problem vastly improves the chances that you will. Or, one problem at a time, and be positive about that problem. You also say, “Okay my dad is bipolar II and I haven’t been diagnosed because I’m pretty good at compensating and none of my docs have considered it a diagnosis helpful. But inside my head is a cacophony (discord or disharmony) and I’m always on the verge of losing it.” Since your dad is bipolar, you may be also. My grandmother was, and I was. You’ve already said, “inside my head is a cacophony (discord or disharmony) and I’m a
lways on the verge of losing it.” Symptoms of bipolar from mayoclinic.org says, “When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. “When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.” Do you have that? You say, “I just don’t have any realistic way to imagine getting better.” You’ve written in for help so that’s a start."

heard the ""glass theory"" ? Well..it just talks about if you hold the glass for a few minutes its not heavy..but if you were told to hold it for a few hours the glass would be heavy....and so on and so on...And they relate that to how small problems begin to feel when you dont deal with them.."

175961938,"Your government should have a list of disorders that render a person automatically eligible to disability income, and disorders requiring that you meet other conditions. Where I live at least, it is better if you produce every three months , a medical form filled by a doctor attesting you have long term work limitations, until your demand is accepted. I told my psychiatrist I wanted to work, had some pills prescribed, went to work one day or two, gave up, couldn't bear to be around people. Before leaving the office, you could pretend that you almost forgot the medical form you brought with you. Oh and by the way, being dirt poor is bad for your health you know. Last diagnosis was schizotypal with precarious contact with reality. The funny thing is I'm pretty sure I have a better grasp of reality than most people. There was another form I had to submit to my social security office in which I described briefly my life history and limitations. Also a phone interview was scheduled with a government doc
tor, but the law didn't require me to have it, so they used the info they already had. Good luck."

175961940,"_PERSON_, you are making an effort to take control of your life which, apparently, is filled with Anxiety. Therefore, you are using coping skills to manage it the best you can. It's true... Just breathe! The very fact that you are aware of your problem, is a major breakthrough. It's just not easy. Maybe a support group (besides this online approach) would help you; to hear how others who have the same problem you are trying to work through, deal with their anxiety issues. So many of the difficult things in our lives must be handled with whatever coping skills we are taught, learn for ourselves or need to face head on. I know that from the time I was young (I'm and old lady now), I would get myself through with self-talk. You work out little tricks for yourself. This is not really about ""anxiety"" per se, but an example of dealing with the things that come at us in daily life, like job interviews and other matters we have to face but make us nervous, anxious or actually fearful - I would convince m
yself that I was an actress, and this is the scene I had to get through. With that in my mind, I could get through just about anything for the next 30 minutes (or whatever). I'm just trying to point out to you, that we all have issues, demons and so forth, and everyone - who appears to have it all together - has the same problem as you or someone else, but has just learned how to manage it. Believe me, I used to wonder why everyone in the world seemed to be an ""adult"" and seemed so successful and in control of their life, and I wasn't! Come to find out, just about everyone felt the same way! It's like, Fake it, Until You Make It! Good luck."

175961967,"Good for you, _NAME_. I've always thought that getting out and helping and volunteering was very helpful to ourselves and to others. There is a saying that goes: ""Happiness can't be found , wen u seek It for urself But wen u give to others , It 'll find its way back to u ... Dats The Mystery of HAPPINESS...!!"" I've always advocated for others to volunteer at places like libraries, senior citizens homes, hospitals, walking a dog at a kennel. I've never thought of the farm and the food pantry. I've always advocated those places for others but I don't actually go to any of these places myself. I have a condition in which I can't be around a lot of noise, and every place seems to have phones, functional music and other sources of noise which I can't tolerate. So I feel I'm kinda locked out. Also, I must have some sort of psychological condition, I just don't gravitate towards crowds or people. Now if I'm in a situation with other people, I'll be the most talkative person there, and I'll enjoy it more 
than the others. But I don't purposely walk out and seek those kinds of places. It's probably social anxiety. My dad was like that. He stayed by himself except for work. But now that you've mentioned it, I may have to give that food bank a thought. I think socialization like that, helping others, would help ourselves to fight depression and low self esteem. I went to Easter Seals therapy workshop putting tags on soap boxes, but putting tags on soap boxes around other people, and from depressed, I was probably the happiest person in the building. As a bipolar, that makes sense. It also led to a job for me. But it started with Easter Seals therapy workshop. It started with people. Food pantry, around people, same thing."

When I think about the details it gives me a headache because I don’t think about it. I don’t want to take life and I don’t feel any urges ever. I’m very sure if I open up to my doctor she’ll think I’m a danger to myself, but I’m not I can recover easily. I just a little support because I’ve been so low and so many frequent complicated negative things have happened in my life, that I just don’t want to feel alone. I’m pretty sure I need a therapist so I will do that immediately, 
but I wanted to talk about other important things not this incident. I’m very nervous because I don’t know if it’s the right or wrong thing to keep it to myself... If I do I’m sure I can recover on my own meanwhile practicing the tools I get from therapy. Anyways, thank you for reading."

She’s lived in a suffering state all of her adult life. That’s not living to me. Her 8 yr old daughter is watching and experiencing the fall out. Her relationships don’t last. Her job situations end in contention. Yikes! 17 is a perfect time to get on a different path for something that looks and feels more easeful and kind to all. There. Are some amazing healers, acupuncturists, etc. I’ve gone to a trauma therapist (63 yes old) the last four years and it’s helped me in multiple ways. I’m living life much more from a beautiful state. Even in the hard times. You deserve that too!"

175961994,"I should have kept contact with a friend I had in 2017 when I was abusing stimulants. He was an autistic savant and made millions of dollars for being the biggest online dark web drug vendor in Canada. We would chat often and I'd help him with his cocaine addiction. He would spend 6000 dollars a month on it. He'd often put it in envelopes and mail them to himself so he gets a 2 week break from using it. He talked about how his mom has borderline personality disorder and so did his ex girlfriends and got taken advantage of due to his aspergers. At the end, he told me about how he knows almost everything about BPD. I could have kept in contact with him now that I know how to send cryptographic messages. He would be really able to help me. He says that people with BPD that have a high IQ are more dangerous than psychopaths because they manipulate people, take all of their money and cause people to kill themselves. But yeah anyways I'm feeling better today after taking phenibut. I'll just try to ignore 
this stuff for a while and work on myself and just chill."

I noticed that I seem to be in a bad mood more often and am wondering if you experienced this as a side effect. I struggle with bad mood including irritability and agitation anyway off and on but seems to be more persistent now. Not sure if it's just me or the meds. I also take a low dose antidepressant and felt I was on the right track with just that. Thank you."

174350809,"It's good that you seemed to have found something that works. It seems that they treated the depression in 2001. Were they finally treating the mania in 2009? Was the jumping up and down mania or were you just happy? Is there any bipolar in your family. I got mine from my mother's mother, who was bipolar before they knew what it was, and just called it schizophrenia. But then they didn't have any medicine for either of that in the 1930s and 1940s, so she basically went untreated in a mental hospital. So we can appreciate the fact that they do have medicine now for bipolar, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other such conditions. We can be very glad. My grandmother would go into people's medicine cabinets looking for a pill that would calm her down from the ravages of bipolar. Now we just go to the drug store. For my bipolar, I take Lithium for the mania and Mirtazapine for the depression. Those were the pills my grandmother was longing for."

175962008,"I told my doctor about the ""veins"" on my back. My mom said that I was being paranoid. Sometimes it hurts and I feel veins but no one can see or feel them. Only I can feel them. He said that it's just back pain. I said ""But they're muscles?"" - ""Back pain"" he said. I told him about jolting awake when I fall asleep cuz of heart disturbance/jumping/fluttering when I lack sleep and he said that it's normal and happens to him sometimes... But I'm suspicious.. So many somatic problems I have. I told him that I feel like I'm in jail or the psych ward and care about nothing, lazy, apathetic.. He seems to be the same way and it's ok for this time of year + the economy and pandemic.. But yeah he refilled the clonazepam.. 0.25mg of clonazepam is really strong now and puts me to sleep when I'm lacking sleep. Usually when people lack sleep, they become tired?? I become MORE AWAKE. The last time I've ever felt tired was when I ate dark chocolate (The trypt-ophan or something..) or when I was tripping (On 4-
acet-oxy-di-methyl-TRYPT-amine).. Constant yawning etc.. Now I wake up exhausted - Antipsychotic exhausted which isn't a genuine tiredness.. or sleepiness.. Stimulant... And zopiclone isn't a real tiredness either.. It's more like a dream-hypnotic state. I'm a mess man. I want my creative thoughts back cuz I'm doing nothing. I'm on too much antipsychotics. I hate them. Half the time I don't believe in schiz diagnosis. Meh. Have a good day all"

Still despite trading up from a 17 year old car this is considered to be what mania looks like in me.

For me, wandering through parks or old parts of a city provided there aren't a ton of people or visiting ghost towns is more my style, but then again, unlike you, I'm anxious/agitated by a lot of people around me and mildly socially retarded. The antique stores quite possibly suit you though (not that others' opinions of what suits someone or what someone should or shouldn't spend their money on matters). I forgot about those, it's been years! I'm rarely on good terms with them and they lost pretty much all the stuff they'd accumulated in a house fire when I was in my teens, but when I was very young, my parents used to be obsessed with antique hunting and bargaining - and they'd do it with their other couples that they were friends with and they'd re-furnish it (or whatever that term is, restore?). Almost everything in their house used to be antique and they had a l
ot of really fancy jewelry they got for cheap that they found in old dusty shops It was interesting, my mother would always have those jeweler magnifying glass cup things that you hold between your finger and thumb in her purse to check the stones and engravings in the metals in case she ended up in one those stores and I remember her tapping stones in rings on her teeth to make sure they weren't plastic or glass, etc. The only thing I remember, is how to tell the difference between fake or resconstitued _NAME_ and fake/reconstituted opals from the real thing - and obviously to check for engraving/stamps on silver and gold etc. - not that I particularly buy jewelry much. I do love my pretty random crystals and stones though. I completely forgot about that piece of my life until now."

Have been taking new dosage for a week and now its working. Find that this drug does not cause me any unpleasant side effects. Worth a try
175962042,"I think many therapists fail in getting to the core problems of their patients mental illness. They teach you how to handle it like how to live your everyday life but it’s more like distractions instead of fixing the core problems. Talking about our problems helps, yes, but only talking won’t take us anywhere. We end up sounding like a broken record, same old problems after years. I see this mostly with people with trauma."

My Doc tells me take Viagra or Cialis but I woud much prefer to stop the anti- D s ..I did a lot of reseach and , I am reading that bipolar patients should not take anti depressants.Some researchers say the bipolar 2 patients may take a very small dose of anti-D s.My question is do any of you BIPOLAR 2 people take anti-D s with your mood stabilizer ?????"

175962050,"Hi, my name is _PERSON_ and I'm 21 years old. About a month ago I had my precious son, after having an unplanned c-section they took me to the recovery room where a nurse watched over me to make sure everything was okay. Thirty minutes into recovery I started to hemorrhage, there were about fifteen nurses in the room working on me to try and stop the bleeding. Every single one of the nurses pushed down on my stomach to make sure the blood clots were coming out. Once they realized they tried what they could, I woke up to them stopping everything they were doing and I felt cool, weak, and I can see my vital signs going down. I thought that this was going to be the end of my life. How could I leave this earth without knowing how my son was going to look like? How could something like things happen to me when I'm a healthy young adult? These were just two of the things running through my mind. Before the doctor took me to the operating room I told her to take out my uterus if it has to be done, but the
y didn't do that. The doctors wanted to save my uterus just in case later in life I want more children, but the thing is I knew the consequences of a c-section and everything else. The doctors thought they stopped the bleeding and saved my uterus, but they didn't it only made things worse. So they took me to the OR for the third time and actually took out my uterus. Through all of this, I felt like I was slowly and painfully passing. I have been reliving this moment for what's almost 3 months already. I can't sleep, because every time I try to I feel like I'm not going to wake up."

Then the nurse got me out of there and got me an Ativan to calm me down. Ugh."

175962075,"I've recently restarted therapy myself, and i am also struggling. (3rd therapist, 2+ years of therapy) I don't like my therapist and feel angry towards her but I realise this must be the same feelings that I had as a child towards my parents. (because I hardly know her really and these feelings are pretty strong). This is something I should talk to her about but it's so hard (It's called transference I believe and hard for anyone to talk to their therapist about) I was recommended on this forum object relation therapy, which seems good, but I can't seem to find therapists in my country who do this therapy and anyway I realised the reason why therapy hasn't done anything for me so far, is me not opening up enough. So I just started regular therapy (my thinking was: if the problem is me anyway, I can might as well ""practise"" opening up first doing cheap therapy. Btw it's cheap because it's subsidised by government) What I didn't think through is that it's CBT, and i hate this, it makes me feel that 
it's all my own fault for thinking the wrong thing. Also something I should talk to her about. She will start another job soon (she told me in the 2nd session, very annoying) so I'll get someone new, so even if I could get myself to talk about these things it sort of feels a little useless since she's leaving anyways. (Yes this maybe an excuse to let myself off the hook)(damnit didn't i tell myself i need to practise!?) I think about these things a lot but when i am in a session very little of this actually comes out of my mouth. It's so FRUSTRATING especially because it is ME doing this, makes me hate myself for not being able to move forward I feel I need therapy to learn how to do therapy One thing I don't do anymore in therapy is sit down. On a chair. Sitting down makes me feel pinned down on that chair for the whole session. No control over how close she and I are. I stand up (for instance leaning against the wall) or I sit on the floor (towards the end of the session). This way I am free to move around 
so I have some control over the space between us. Seems silly but really does help me feel a little more at ease And I actually refuse to sit down even for a minute for fear of not daring to get up again"

175962081,"I had a moment like this just last night. I try to remind myself how I can get through this because I’ve gotten through everything up to this point, which is proof that I can do it. Sometimes I rely or pure stubbornness and spite to keep myself going. I also like to think about how I could literally do anything I want to. I could live in a _NAME_ and travel around the United States. I could join the Peace Corps and go to India. Sometimes this can be an avoidance technique, which isn’t always great if you have pressing issues to deal with. But sometimes it’s nice to step away from what’s happening and realize that I could literally do anything. That doesn’t mean that I won’t still have to deal with mental illness if I decide to change my life completely, I know I will always have to deal with that. But I can change my whole life situation in a moment if I want to. I think it’s freeing"

I have no side effects of Trileptal yet. I'm surprised my doctors never thought of putting me on it, also surprised I never heard of it all of these years until like 8 months ago. Maybe it wasn't generic yet."
175962086,Loik at ya options. Some community ctrs and church groups offer much cheaper options. I don't know ya location...however i am Australian and not a stack on hw. Others will pop in. Yeah that is thru the nose...way too expensive...even for the admin part. First impression is key...but after the admin is over the real stuff will begin. Give a real session or two for rhe feeling out phase...some therapists are not the right fit...but ya will know pretty quick. Maybe the person dislikes the admin. There human. Word of mouth is best. Check em out i say. Do ya research....it is imperative. Keep . HT
175962087,"As a bipolar, I take 2, 300 mg. tablets of Litihium and 7.5 mg of Mirtazapine anti-depressant a day. Sorry to to hear that the lithium became toxic. It's good to hear that your new medicines are working. Don't know that I've ever had mixed episodes of mania and depression. Without medicine I was usually one or the other. The Lithium kept my mania in check and the anti-depressant helped with that. Do you still get bad manic episodes, even on the meds? What happens when that occurs? You say you're more depressed right now? I was probably somewhat depressed and got a helper who visited 2 or 3 times a week to get groceries, etc., and on the 1st or 2nd visit she told a joke and I thought, ""I don't laugh."" After a few weeks, she told a joke and I heard someone laugh and I looked around and tried to find out who that was. It turned out it was me. I had laughed for probably the first time in a long time. So some socialization helped me. Are you able to be around people? You asked you were wondering very 
much how bi-polar people cope. Are you going through some difficulties now?"

It's quite crazy when I think about all of this stuff.. Not only that but I sent him and his cousin the video ""Another Brick In The Wall"" cuz it's exactly like how we were when we were in school.. All the strictness and abuse from teachers, concrete walls and buildings.. It's pure insanity.. And he told me that he was dealing with depression and psychosis so.. I mean ****.. It's good to laugh and appreciate art.. I think my mental breakdown is almost over. I always feel better after them. I'm gonna try and play this song on guitar.. I just want to play guitar for now..

175962094,"Hi everyone, my name is _PERSON_. When I was 13 I was severely struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I ended up attempting to take my own life twice. However, during that time I found a local Foundation that helped me embark on a journey of healing. They gave me the tools, support and wisdom that I need to make change and move forward in my life. I am grateful to say 5 years later, I am happier than ever and I owe it to the tools they gave me such as mindfulness, meditation, a safe environment where I could open up about my struggles, journaling, etc... I now intern for this Foundation and we are putting on a free virtual event with the mission to bring physical, emotional and mental health tools to the masses. I would love to provide this resource to this community and feel free to forward it along to anyone else you think could benefit from it.

So, just do that. But get a glutamate drug. They r the only things that truly ""cure"" all hundred percent of my symptoms. Problem is, they hose short term memory and if u ovetshoot, u end up manic and often psychotic for stimes days or longer. That is why I cannot take one. Hugs."
175962099,"I enjoy a state of hyper focus. Vyvanse helps me a little with that. I can watch TV while my mom and sister are talking and not hear them or I can do something on my phone at a noisy restaurant and I wouldn't hear anything. But that's only if I take an extra stimulant. It's good to have a balance - That's why I'm interested in ""hypomania"". It seems like a pleasant state of mind. But I've never had euphoric mania before except during my last good psychedelic trip. It was mostly a dysphoric agitated energized depression. I'm gonna look into sarcosine and ask my doctor about it first - Or my psychiatrist."

175962103,Seems like a good move to see a psychiatrist. He (or she) may suggest medication changes or not -- but usually psychiatrists are better at medication management than internal medicine (general practice) docs. So it seems to me you are doing the right thing. Good luck with it.
175962104,"Omg those 'trying to generalize an idea' talks are so unimportant, why does it matter if something exists or not, what matters is the reality of your every-day life and thats it, if you find such a case of a possible serial killer schizoid living next door then and only then this discussion matters, if this is not the case- then this is a purely bulshit hypothethical question and it's answer has nothing to do with your reality, your life will not change in any way if you find the correct answer which makes this question unimportant IF ANYONE HERE OR ANYONE ON ANY OTHER ""SCHIZOID FORUM"" WAS ACTUALLY ######6 SCHIZOID . god damn so many wanna-bes talking about bulshit that shouldnt matter unless they are INVESTED in this reality, from what i saw in wikipedia a schizoid prefers inner world, he is not invested in this reality or other people, ######6 read the disorder that you are trying to fake"

I'm at work and I've been so busy all day I haven't even had time to breathe. I am finally taking a break and I just feel overwhelmed by sadness and I have to try to breathe... I just want to cry... I feel like shit. I miss my ex SO much today, and I'm missing being able to tell him EVERYTHING that goes on at work. I feel so empty... I hate myself for giving him so much power over me that I even feel this way all. But I have depression and I'm co-dependent. Is it rateally my fault that I feel the way I feel? Am I just trying to blame my shitty feelings on ""depression""? I've read so many sad stories on these sites and I feel like my issues are so dumb compared to what others go through. I'm having such a roller coaster of a time trying to get through all of my pain. Anyway, I had my therapist refer me to an outpatient psychiatric hospital program and hopefully I 
hear back soon... I just want to get better and although the meds are keeping me at bay, I still feel mostly under water."

174350915,Do you have GAD? That’s pretty much random anxiety but it doesn’t last so long usually. Could it be the abilify? That ones activating so a lot of people react differently to it. Is what you’re hearing and seeing worse than usual?

My sister is on PRN Ativan for panic attacks. We're an anxious family. My dad uses alcohol (But somehow not when he works). My mom is a mild-moderate alcoholic as well (But somehow not when she works). They've always been functioning alcoholics my whole life.

175962129,"You might be hypovolemic. Push some fluids. It will probably help. I do get weird sensations in my head or brain or whatever it is and have all my life. When I was a kid and then later, I used to be able to predict when I was going to get depressed, because my whole, like, brain would star tingling, first in the back, then, moving all the way forward. It would take about fifteen minutes and then, I would be depressed for a while. Later, as an adult, the opposite happened. when I would come out of a depression, my brain wpould start tingling again. I knew what was going to happen. I always wondered if I had a seizure disorder or something. And I did have seizures later on. So, don't know about other folks, but I do think this sort of thing happens to some of us. I always assumed, because of the tingling nature for me, that it was just electrical activity, depolarization or whatever, occurring. Dunno though."

I've been on Citalopram 40Mg for years, and it's helped for the most part. I've maxed out my Asacol dosage, so after last year long flare, I seemed to have come out of it by this February. Then the pandemic hit, I started eating poorly, drank too much coffee etc. Followed with a family trauma occurring August in which has brought me to constant anxiety with chest pain, GERD...like symptoms, and can't sleep without a pill, of which I will run out soon. I'm in Canada, and could get a perception for cbd oil. Does anyone here have any insight here? medication reactions? I am trying breathing techniques that only help for a bit.

175962141,"Hi Joy1989, Welcome to the anxiety and panic support forum. Citalapram (aka Celexa) are SSRI's. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. The thing with these medications is they can take awhile to work. Though you can start feeling better sooner, they can take six to eight weeks to reach full potential. So being patient is the key. I would let the doctor know what is going on. It could just be a side effect that may go away in seven to ten days. Or the medication might not be right for you. The doctor may be able to give you something to calm you at night. What time of the day are you taking the medication? If you are taking it in the evening, it might be the reason for poor sleep. Some medications are suppose to be taken in evening, some not. I hope that things get better for you. Stay safe. Hugs, _NAME_..."

At 25 I was on my own, done with school. Had my first real job as a police officer. The first and most important thing I would say to you, get out of that relationship. That is so abusive. I know it's easier said than done. I've seen it numerous times. Idk if you've sought help for your PTSD, but I would definitely get some if you haven't. You're young. You have so much of your life ahead. You can have the life and relationship you DESERVE, still. Please don't give up. You're beautiful and need to be treated that way.

Perhaps meeting someone at a support group or something like that? I was telling my _PERSON_ about my concerns because I do want to get married one day. What she said was so simple yet so profound. We all have our issues. I just have to remember that no one is perfect (that helps me ease up on myself and hope that a man would be interested if we're compatible). But yeah, I do still have concerns about how to bring it up. But honestly, I've seen friends and family with MI and other struggles still couple up so I'm optimistic."
175962190,"Yea. I'm probably just gonna get a better, sturdier trashcan with a top. Her getting in it DOES force me to pretty much take out the trash. Especially when its overfilled. But yea that is a good idea too."

175962194,"I actually just had a friend breakup because she was starting to become very toxic. If I was with anyone else, (including my boyfriend) she would become very rude and start ignoring me. I finally decided after she had pushed everyone away in my life that she was the problem and something needed to be done. I told her I no longer wanted to be friends and she immediately blocked me on everything and started telling everyone in my life lies about me. It’s been a rough few days but I can through it with time and so can you! Do the right thing and get rid of your toxic friends!"

175962198,"If I get this job, assuming they call me, since they said they want to, it’ll add 750 more to our income a month. That’s almost 4K a month. I think we settled on a house. It’s not the best one but the foundation and skirting is in the price. So all we’d have to do is set up the septic system since it’s in the country, and the electrical and water line. Which the water line I think we are gonna put it down ourselves. My dad used to own and operate a construction company back in the 80s and 90s and 70s. So he already has all that equipment. Tractors, dump trucks, etc the world. Otherwise we would have to deal with foundation, skirting, septic system, electrical pole installation and meter, water line and water meter hookup, getting the driveway poured, carport built, and of course permits for all of that. There’s something else I think. Oh! A/c system also. We’d have to pay thousands upon thousands out of our pocket. But the price of the house is a lot but it comes with most of that in 
the price. We’d save money by choosing to go this way. And then just digging a trench/laying pvc type stuff for the water. So all we’d be paying for out of pocket/cash. Would be water meter and electric pole meter, and then the septic system and installation. Gonna go see the model home tomorrow. Will ask for a full rundown of the price. Won’t go through with the application until I get approved for that job, if I do. And also gonna ask if it comes with all the appliances. Did more research on that and I believe it does. Except washer and dryer. But all the kitchen appliances it does I think."

175962218,I am semi freaking out. Trying to calm my nerves I woke up w/vicious pain in my left armpit. I didn’t think much of it. Took a shower and shaved. Went to put on deodorant and I almost passed out . Weird. Go to the bathroom and look and I have 3 pretty good sized lumps in my left pit. Check the right and there’s one there too but not painful. Ignore it.... Brought my daughter to the doc and my put was really hurting. Ended up going to the stupid walk in because Dr _PERSON_ is an asshole and told me I had leukemia *smh* Turns out I have some sort of bacterial skin infection in my pits. Idk if it’s from cutting myself shaving in the tub at the condo we stayed at or using the life jackets and harnesses... I just know I feel dirty and disgusting. I have abx ointment and she told me I can’t shave for 10 days and I shouldn’t sweat... Umm it’s like 10000000000% humidity but okie no sweating. Open for pit hair styling suggestions

175962226,"I suppose this forum is for getting better and trusting the psychiatrist.. yet many don't trust when they're sick.. and also, we don't really get better 100%. So finding a way to get better has to be either WAIT for the future (Which may never come. The world can end). So yeah.. And I think about helping you guys in a way that I can and I'm not sure if I should tell the truth (Like for example: _PERSON_ said a psychiatrist could be poisoning her to make her worse to get rid of mental illness.. I said NO but there's a possibility that a few doctors could be doing that because they're psychopaths unless that's my paranoia and if it's real, it's my delusion. But it's best to not complicate things and allow people to get better which is a social thing and I'm socially intelligent so it's all good.. But I wonder if it's better to tell the truth.. talk about things..). I was intrigued when I was a kid that I had a deep conversation with friends about God not being real for like a few minutes. It didn't s
tart that way because I was thinking about that stuff in my head.. growing up catholic when I was apathetic towards it but yeah.. Sorry guys I'm just venting. Ignore me.."

175962237,"It’s so much easier to see mistakes others are making than it is to see our own mistakes. I am now in a stable marriage but that didn’t happen until I was 41. I spent so much energy prior to meeting my husband on trying to meet the right guy. I really don’t think you should waste any more time on this guy. He’s told you he wants to be friends and perhaps your behaviour is scaring him away. Most guys like a challenge. If he is still in your life you should try to act more confident and less needy,even if you don’t feel it! I don’t like game playing but it wouldn’t hurt if you cancelled on him once in awhile,just to make yourself appear more desirable! And if that doesn’t work,it might be time to move on! I realize it’s not easy to meet new people,especially with the pandemic keeping many of us so isolated but that’s just the way it is right now. Maybe if you find an activity which involves meeting others,such as an exercise class or a special interest group,you might meet a good 
guy who has similar interests. That’s a good starting place. And don’t be afraid to just be friends with someone. My husband and I were friends for 2 years before we became romantically involved. There always hope!"
175962238,"Honestly, my husband is the problem. Of course he is the only person I interact with because all of the others left years ago. When you get diagnosed with a disease, I have scleroderma, and you are no longer the person going going going, those who are used to you always being there for them decide they have no use for you. On the days where I am energetic I take care of chores I didn’t do on my tired days. I can’t afford someone to clean my house and the husband complains when I ask for his assistance. But he sure loves it when I’m having a good day a cook him good meals, have the house cleaned up and laundry done. I’ve been looking to see if I can find group therapy online or even a therapist that does zoom. Not being able to drive does have its downfalls. I’m just frustrated."

She's grabbed me so hard and bruised my upper arm. She's punched (not in the face tho) me and bruise me. She'd called me a lazy ***** quite a few times. She's grown up since I was a teen.

I drank 8 plus cups daily for years and just stopped cold turkey 3 days ago. Horrible headaches and moodiness, had nausea too. I’m going to keep at it though because coffee is acidic and wears on tooth enamel, which I can’t afford to mess up anymore due to my history with bulimia causing a lot of tooth damage. And I want to have better quality sleep. My Fitbit always gives my sleep a score of like 73-77 out of 100 (fair) I think it could be better without all the caffeine. And I’m sure it wasn’t helping my panic attacks much anyways. So I’m resetting my tolerance so I can enjoy a cup of coffee once in awhile months from now and it can actually have that euphoric effect on me like it used to. And just drink it on special occasions."

I know it might sound scary to get someone else involved.... Maybe you have a family member or coach or teacher that would help you find the resources you need right now. If not, would you consider talking to a school counselor? (Even if you have to figure out how to contact them right now I think it would be worth it). If there’s not someone you know you’d want to talk to, you can try to find a social worker to get involved. The link below says they help with mental health issues, but they also can help with neglect and abusive situations. https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/how-to-get-a-social-worker/ I empathize with your mom, but her choice to stay is negatively affecting the whole family.

One will be an office and spare bedroom for both our families, just in case. Its gonna take us a while to save up for some furniture but we are hoping to get a spare dining table from 
family and maybe a couch. But I dont think we know anyone with a spare couch. So that'll be something we will have to buy on our own. Eek! I'm so excited! I figured I'd buy decorative pieces from the thrift store or Facebook marketplace. But the couch will be new, probably from big lots or some place cheap. Pictures will definitely be shown when we move in and get everything situated!!!"

175962294,Yeah I would be be floored too... it’s like your mom wants you to struggle and gets off by helping you so you’re under her debt. I don’t think I’d get along with your mom tbh.
175962295,She also ordered me a crockpot and a new pair of shoes.

175962306,"How good of a listener are you? There are courses online like at Online Courses & Lectures for Home Study and Lifelong Learning that were great for me. I have some recommendations but they can be pricey. Sometimes I just look up something on youtube. I don't like to watch a video, instead I listen and keep my busy busy with something simple. If you are going to do this, I recommend cleaning a room or the dishes. Or going out for a walk. Is there a store nearby? You could browse. I listen to stuff when I grocery shop. A lot of people do it, even the people collecting the carts do it. Keeping the body busy with something simple is like a form of meditation for me because that's how I work most of the time."
175962307,Logically I know everyone deserves to eat. I just feel so guilty about everything. I’m useless and don’t deserve anything. I can’t even enjoy a promotion right.
175962308,"Hmmm. I'm better with cats than I am with dogs. It seems like at 1.5 years she is still a ""teenager"" but one would think the need to chew up things would be gone. Than again, my Mom has a ten year old poodle who likes to shred paper all the time and occasionally tear up her toys. My Mom's dog _NAME_ has an oral fascination. She has to constantly be chewing on something. Is _USER_ID_ like that? We give _NAME_ lots of chew sticks throughout the day to keep her occupied, and have tried those Kong things for her. She has lots of those nylon looking bones that she can chew on as well. I'm sure you've tried all that for _USER_ID_. Have you mentioned it to the vet? They may have a solution that you haven't thought of. One thing also that helped _NAME_ was going to obedience school--though she had to do it twice--hard headed nut that she is--and she was taught the command ""leave it"" when we wanted her to leave something alone or not bother something. So if we see her heading over to the trash can for e
xample, we will say ""_NAME_--leave it"" in a deep voice and she knows to stop and then we try to engage her with something else. I don't know if that helps. Just what we've tried with _NAME_."

Be gentle with yourself and give yourself the time you need and also the respect for what you are still able to do, even if it is just getting up in the morning and going for a walk! These are tough times for everyone but you seem to have been hit really hard... I am very sorry for you. I lost my father to Parkinson’s years ago. One year after my mother passed. I have two daughters and live in a unhappy marriage.... does. It help anything. Have been thru depression- that is I am still in it, struggling to get myself back - but realize I need to make some changes in my life... I think these hard times that is what they are here for... to contemplate and make a change... sight as it may be... but it looks like you have to take a closer look at your life as well... join a support group or talk to a counselor.. do not let yourself spiral down entirely...! Good luck to you my friend, this won’t be forever. The sun will come

175962318,"Thank you for the response =) In the time since I wrote that, my skipped beats have subsided and I haven't felt any more flutters (it's the flutters that always get me because it always makes me worried they won't stop once they start.) I have calmed down immensely. My blood pressure didn't even get that high (checked it at 9pm like usual and it was 145/90) My doctor has me on buspirone and just today she actually told me to go ahead and start taking two doses a day (I should note that an hour after taking my evening dose that flare up subsided, and now that I think about it, Wednesday night it briefly subsided after I took my dose as well.) The doctor did say if I wanted to or if it'd make me feel better she would get me an appointment with the cardiologist as well for a follow up. So I just gotta make it through the weekend and then call her Monday. (I actually think it being a weekend has me anxious as well since I know no place is open should I have to get checked on. When I went to the ER and 
to the doctor, both times I felt a calmness come over me just knowing I was in those places.)"
175962319,"So I’m kind of new to this, posted a few things but haven’t got many replies. Does this site usually slow down in the summer months? I’m working so I don’t have any vacation. I’m struggling with an eating disorder, trying to overcome it, but I feel disgusting if I eat ‘too much’, so I’m trying now to eat more and doing intermittent fasting. I add 12+ hours to when I finish supper and that’s when I can next eat… ends up being a late breakfast, which isn’t too hard. Yesterday I didn’t have supper so I went 17.5 hours. Is this normal to do? I feel guilty to eat all the time and lots, because of my disorder, so this way I’m eating more but feel like I’m still dieting because of the fasting. I’ve also got depression… flares up at times but for the most time I can fake a smile and pretend everything’s ok. I can’t visit therapist because of COVID, but I have a crisis textline I’d highly recommend it to anyone that needs a therapist but can’t afford it or can’t fin
d the time to actually go and talk face to face with one. I’m falling into a dark hole and I can’t really help it, I’ve been faking my emotions for too long. I am depressed, I’m not suicidal or self harming, because I’ve gone through that once and it’s not a good way to cope. Because of this I’m stuck, because I have no energy to do anything proactive about it, and am forcing myself not to go down the rabbit hole of bad coping techniques. In addition to all of this I’ve got anxiety that flares up at times, too. Sometimes I’ll have multiple panic attacks in a day, so bad they make me feel very sick. Other days I don’t even know I have it… but most days I’m anxious about everything, overthinking everything, and my heart is pounding in my chest at the slightest thing. It can get bad enough that I’m visibly shaking, can’t control it, and I don’t know if this is anxiety or something else. Has anyone else felt this way? Does anyone have suggestions on what I can eat that is filling, he
althy, and low in calories – while being grab-n-go? Does anyone else struggle with what I’m struggling with currently, depression, anxiety or eating disorders? How do others get through this?? I’d really appreciate to not feel alone, and am grateful to anyone that has replied to my previous posts…"

175962328,I don't hear voices. loud muttering at times. Like you're at a loud party but can't really hear anything. I always equated it to a migraine until I was on an anti psychotic for other reasons. I get the bug sensation and the everyone hates me paranoia. I was diagnosed (still am) with bipolar for years. The only one that knows my diagnosis changed IRL is my husband and treatment team. Everyone else knows I have bipolar. I was not surprised when I was told they (dx team) tried to brace me for the dx but I knew what I was walking into.

As far as effects of buspar on my anxiety, I'm not sure yet."" This is better than a reality TV show. Wondering which way this will go. But you're in the race, that's the important thing. You're still taking 60mg of Prozac which treats depression as well as anxiety. And have recently added 5 mg of Buspar, which treats anxiety. You have a lot going for you. What do they say, modern medicine? As I've said, my grandmother, who had bipolar like I do, didn't have that in the 1930's, 40's and early 50's. She spent a lot of her time 100 miles from her home in a state mental hospital, with walls. She used to go into people's medicine cabinets, thinking, ""It's a pill isn't it? Why won't it make me better?"" That was her fantasy. You're living her dream. As for sleep, I take 4, 1 mg. of Melatonin an hour or 2 before bedtime. You can check with your pharmacist

175962347,"I like commenting about mental health issues to online forums, such as HealingWell.com, in part, because I like to try to help others who have mental illness like I do. However, I occasionally worry that my comments, which are intended to be helpful to others, will actually make some people reading my comments feel worse, especially if they're having a bad day. For example, if I talk about how I found talking about my past traumatic experiences to a therapist as something that helped me, it may get someone who is reading my comments who has also been through trauma in their past to think about the trauma they've been through, and maybe feel worse as a result. Therapists run into the same basic problem. Psychotherapy can be upsetting at times for some clients. However, that doesn't mean they should stop performing therapy. But still, I sometimes worry about making comments about mental illness to forums such as this one. What do you think about this? Also, do you worry about this sort of thing as we

Most of the time I just need to know I have them just in case. I am not sure now if they will even prescribe them again. If not, what are my other options. I have tried every natural supplement and they dont help. I tried valium and it did nothing. I figured a lot of people had anxiety but why is it so hard to get xanex"

175962411,"I really wish it could have been my father there. I remember so vividly the first time I watched episode 4 the last hope. Looking at _NAME_ looking at orange orbs in the desert like atmosphere, and listening to obi wan's lectures. I remembered when, in a later episode, when _NAME_ refastended his black gove to cover his robotic hand so _PERSON_ wouldn't see it. It was a reminder of his weakness and stoof for something cold, and unliving, much like vader. That was the first time I understood a metaphor. That's monumental for a child to summon. _NAME_ is a genius for providing the grist for that to happen."
175962412,"Back at work, taking lunch. Wednesday is my birthday so im not working that day. Good way to break up the week. ? Ill be the big 38.

175962414,"Thank you! You're right. I am in therapy but I'm just beginning to work on my _NAME_ again. I struggled with it for many years, then recovered from it for an entire year, was doing great, then relapsed I guess and have been struggling again but I'm working on it now. I'm going to stay on my current meds and not add anything else, I don't want to go through having to adjust to a whole new medication, it's really not worth it, like you said."

175962417,lexapro is a pretty strong med. i advise staying at 5 mg for a while since you are having severe startup effects. it s an execellent med but i was not able to tolerate it but do very well on celexa which is a older weaker form of lex. hang in there. i also had the burning skin . it went away eventually. just hang on.
175962418,"I wondered what the substance use was in the general population? I found this: Mental health statistics: substance misuse | Mental Health Foundation ""16.6% of adults in England report drinking to hazardous levels, while 1.2% report levels which indicate probable dependence on alcohol.1 3.1% of adults in England show signs of drug dependence and men (4.3%) are more likely to be dependent on illegal drugs than women (1.9%).2 Half of people with drug dependence were receiving mental health treatment in 2014 and adults with drug dependence are twice as likely as the general population to be using psychological therapy.""

175962423,Single mom of 2 kids and I spend most of my days with terrible anxiety and depression sprinkled in as well. Life is so hard and I feel like my mind and body are just numb from all of these emotions. I force myself to eat and struggle to work everyday. I'm scared to try medication because I've had bad experiences with them in the past. I don't know what to do but force myself to go on for my kids. I pray everyday that this goes away or gets easier. I wish I had the answer. It feels like I'm physically sick but I've had bloodwork done which came back fine.
175962424,Yes you can but typically it’s before 40.......as far as sleep though look into hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations.....is sleeping and waking associated

174351304,"I don't even think I have schizoaffective anymore. I have some form of something else. I don't even know. Medicated me is fine. I don't know what my real self is like though. I wish I could demolish any need for myself to take medication. Why is it, anyway, that these substances discovered by scientists help us with our illnesses anyway? This may sound insane, and if it does, just ignore it, but I feel like it's just uncanny that a substance would destroy our symptoms. The thing is, I feel like I'm 100% correct when I have the desire to go off my meds. Then they teach us self acceptance and things like that. Why should I accept my medicated self? I wish I could accept my situation. The reality is just that I cannot though."

So in order to save her the money for a cab ride I took a (paid) vacation day and drove her home, then spent my afternoon refreshing my precalculus knowledge for my calculus course I have starting next week. Had pizza and a couple of drinks. Studied some more hahaha. I've been feeling dissociative lately. Social anxiety creeping in, I guess. I don't feel generally anxious just nervous in social situations. It's annoying more than anything. Work again tomorrow. I think I forgot to put my out of office on my work e-mail. Oops. Oh well."

But hey it's nice see someone do well for themselves and instead of being jealous I want to use it as a motivation on being able to do well for myself. It's hard because I've been hospitalized about 30 times since 2009. Im out and I'm lost. My friends kids were taking away. Almost dealt with homelessness when cps took the kids. I miss the kids... I love my friends I live with. We're family... they're my family. Just like I felt with the snapchat group before deleting it off my phones. I make mistakes... but I'm harder on myself than anyone else."

175962434,"they have done fake coughing, fake sniffing, mirroring etc. the point is they wanted it to be obvious everyone can read my mind and watch me at home and wherever I go, whatever I say to people, wherever I am, even if im talking to 'myself' or thinking to myself. the mania $#%^ is no reason. none of what u try to explain makes sense to me. we are not more talented than them. they know how to build roads and infrastructure all over the world, environment, science, physics, maths etc. it is a silly thing to try and make people assume they are special for being bullied by these mindreaders. the bottom line is they are arseholes who want me to think about god/devil/religion/lack of god/aliens/mindreading/fate/hell non-stop that is the truth and the only truth. if they treat anyone better it's cos they are less ugly on the physical side of things. your face didn't change. your face is the same. what kind of crap r u talking? they r mindreaders who bully a human who is not one. read free your brain and ge
t something from that. they simply want to get reactions out of me. so they can mess me up. or judge me for being strong/weak. they play with me. (us if you are genuine) u r nothing special and neither am i."

It's right where I swore I left it, right in front of me --in plain sight-- when you open the back door. I SWEAR I looked there a dozen times, and that's why I was so frustrated.

175962449,SC- I was not the only one- our division was not making the financial numbers so they were cutting back. So that made it easier to bear for as you know I was the newest person there learning a very complicated position of which I had no experience in. If it had just been me I would have twisted it around and think well you just couldn't make the grade. I will apply for unemployment today. I pulled out my resume to make tweaks but got writers block. A recruiter had actually contacted me recently but I ignored-guess I'll reach out now. Wish I could take some time off to heal but not getting right back in the workforce scares me financially and I'm nearly 60....who wants an old lady. A couple of co-workers made that comment that maybe God closed this door so I could have some time to heal. They expressed what a strong person I am and they didn't know how I was able to get up every morning and come to work and perform as if everything is fine. I am weary of being strong and having the curve balls being 
thrown out at me making me even stronger-but for what? How strong do I have to be? What purpose is this to serve? Thanks for your prayers _USER_ID_- so nice of you to think of me often and pray for me! Please continue to do so-there is power in prayer and I need to have change for the better.

I am curious there too, and another question, did you try the tablets? What kind are they? I am sorry for asking so many questions but I feel at a loss as to what all is going on. And I am sorry the doctor didn't have time to talk to you. I hope that you are able to walk your dog. I try to walk mine every day. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175962463,I’ll be honest. I haven’t taken my meds in three days. First I forgot one day then I got it in my head that I could do without them and wasn’t groggy in the morning and I felt great but today I started having those thoughts again about my image being stolen in the mirror and another world in the mirror and I try not to think about it but I can’t help but have these thoughts. There’s a part of me that doesn’t want to take the meds anymore but the other part of me knows I have to get back on track.

175962473,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ Tripper I sleep okay but it's only because I take sleep medication. I have hallucinations and sometimes paranoia but I don't really struggle with delusions (that I know of). My anxiety is kind of bad. I take Xanax to help it or I try to use deep breathing techniques to help it along as well. The good part about my job is that there isn't a lot of social interaction. I have my own office. I mostly communicate online via email or Skype. I do attend the morning board meeting and two or three people come into my office a day but not much. I used to work retail before I finished my education and that was super hard because of all the interactions with customers and coworkers. So I guess even though I work in an office setting, I'm still pretty isolated. _PERSON_"

175962477,"Hi there, I assume you already tried the therapy and medication options? Discussed your situation with a professional? If not, there are many ways to overcome panic disorder. Therapy (either talk therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and medication are two of them. Mindfulness training and mindful meditation make a huge difference. I really suggest you read about them. I was put on 50 mg Sertraline after my diagnosis and I had great help from that. Also then I learned to recognize my symptoms and cope with them. I learned to shift my focus to a nearby object when I notice panic symptoms were coming. Learning your triggers and being aware of your thought patterns are essential for dealing with a panicky mood. You can discuss everything with your doctor and that would be my first advice for you if you have never addressed your worries before. Hope you feel calmer soon."

It is ALL thought insertion if you think about it. If they know you know they can read your mind and hear your thoughts, everything is a lie. even when they talk about random topics or change the subject to the mundane, it is only to trick so later they can remind you about the fact they are mindreaders and make you feel 'stupid' that you trusted them to be normal or 'stupid' that you forgot about the mindreading aspect of them. they are bad bad bad bad people."

175962539,"Thank you all. It’s just these thoughts when I feel like my face is tingly and it’s not numb. I overthink stupid things and it sets me off completely. But if I'm busy and doing stuff I forget and it’s fine. But then later I remember and it comes back and I always go to the worse case scenario. I’m just stuck in this circle. I’ll ask her about a therapist. I’ve been to so many. Right now I’m sitting here convincing myself my whole right side of my face is numb, but it’s not. I can’t even sit still.

No 8nperson support group these days, so that sucks but to vent on here and let i5 out feels good :) went thru a lot this year and COVID certainly aggravated the circumstances.. but it looks like there is an end to it all, light at the end of the tunnel, so that feels great!

175962551,Yes I did.

175962553,"I only say 'unusual' in that others find it hard to know what is going to trigger me or not. It is unpredictable to myself . But after giving this considerable thought I think everyone's triggers stem from a perceived injury to their sense of self. This is going to vary based on one's level of narcissism, paranoia, fatigue, childhood experiences, life experiences and learned reactions. Because I have led a vastly different life and am different in nature to those I have to currently live and work with, my triggers are often interpreted by others as 'unusual', but for me they make perfect sense. Apart from this, another trigger for me, and many, stems from perceiving others as stupid/ignorant. If they are in a position of power and I have to kowtow to them... that makes me wild, which is why I cannot handle bureaucracy or jobs that entail customer service. One could say this is a 'perception' probably... but really it is not. It is an unfortunate fact of life that many morons are in a position of po

175962554,"OF, as of this past April, I limited my news watching to my local news only for 15 minutes only every morning!! I sip on a little coffee during this time. I check my phone for my weather. This lowered the stress & anxiety level greatly. Give it a try, sitting & watching what's going on across the country is feeding your stress levels. Remember we can only control ourselves. The problem with distributing the vaccines is the availability of medical personnel to give the shots & the space needed to accommodate people. The paperwork has to be processed, then the shot & then the person has to be monitored for 15 minutes before they are allowed to leave. This is the problem. I live in a very large city. Our local health dept posted an online sign up for the vaccine only taking so many people per day. People are given an online appointment only, no walk ins allowed. The online registration asks your age & pre-existing health problems that puts a person at high risk. This started on 12-31 & people stood in 
line for 5 hours in the cold rain that had an appointment. They vaccinated less than 800 people that day. I signed up my husband & I up, but we cannot stand in line for hours like that. They also will not be doing the shots every day either. A few weeks ago they were claiming Walmart, CVS & Walgreens are gearing up to vaccinate people. You've been in these drugstores, now how many people do you think they can accommodate in one day in their closed quarters, not many. I go outside a lot during the day & just deep breathe to clear my thoughts. Even in the cold I piddle around on the back porch. I play online games sometimes, I like card games. Sometimes we get in the truck & just go for a ride, nothing like getting out of the city & riding around on the back roads. We don't have to get out of the truck to do this. Anything for some diversion. Regardless of all the chaos we all have many things to be thankful for, sometimes that gets lost in the shuffle. Yes, keep the politics out of the threads whether names ar
e mentioned or not please. Mods really do not like editing posts or having to lock them."
175962555,"So my trip begins tomorrow. I am having mixed feeling about it. I am somewhat glad to be seeing some family but at the same time. I am dreading the drive up there plus being away from home for a couple days. I am worried that something bad will happen. I wish I didn't have all this anxiety. I know I will be fine when the actual trip actually happens but its just the anticipation. Before I go on my trip, I was wondering if I should turn off the water to my toilet. I am leaning towards not doing it because I will only be gone for a couple days- less than 48 hours. I know people who have done it for super long extended periods of time like for several months."
175962556,Best thing to help me with voices was the med Trilafon (perphenazine). It's truly an amazing medication. I know a lot of other people here and in the bipolar forum have had good experiences with it too.

175962559,"Really upset. My psych doctors office asked me to come in for services in person even tho they gave me the option of telehealth. And said I can't do tele next time. But I'm still very afraid of covid and it makes me really angry. I understand that I eventually have to come in next time due to insurance, but why do they need to ask me why I'm switching from in-person to telehealth when they GAVE me the option? I don't feel the need to answer why. and so I just straight up said ""I'm not trying to be rude but I'm afraid of covid."""

This makes me kind of gloomy and evokes feelings of jealousy. Although I don't play baseball, I feel like I should have made it big in somethin by now. I feel like I wasted my 20's away and now I work a regular 9-5 and pretty ordinary. Its frustrating some people achieve early and I am a relative later bloomer when it comes to success. I do okay but nothing compared to what my cousin is about to be doing. I feel like I have wasted my life and fear I may not achieve my goals in life. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I can get rid of these feelings?"
175962598,"For almost a year now my husband and I have been doing food prep, which means that we prepare our meals in advance for the week. We’ve found it extremely helpful in helping us to eat in a more healthy way, working around our busy schedules and around my mental and physical illnesses. Feeling proactive Being prepared for the days ahead and knowing that I have planned healthy meals and prepared food for our little family with help from my wonderful husband, allows me to feel proactive and empowered. I am using everything at my disposal to beat my mental illness, not to allow it to dictate my life. Often during the week I am too tired or my mood is too low to make a healthy meal, so it’s tempting to eat something unhealthy or get a takeaway: food prep means that we have healthy, tasty meals there that we can just heat up to curb this need. I have that satisfaction of knowing that I am taking action, taking control of my own life rather than allowing bipolar disorder to take that control away. http

And my little sister turns out completely ok. I was the one that completely lost it. It's like the past few months especially two years, I started to get better.

I am sure you are a person that many would be privileged to call friend...but it is hard to meet new people sometimes...especially if you are no longer working or don't get out as much as you once did.

It could be disorienting to experience caregivers projecting their own personal issues by being distressed/depressed/stressed over a child's conformity to religion. That's sort of the point for children like the scapegoat especially. They're supposed to be a run off for everyone else's tension and anxiety. As for lost child, it's interesting because that one is often the least present one - and the closest for naturally dissociative and living in their own world. I have a theme in mind here. Are you familiar with attachment styles? - Secure - Avoidant - Ambivalent - Disorganized I was recently learning about this and was fascinated to find disorganized attachment was also called disoriented attachment at times. For some reason I got the mental image of this from what you said (hiding ""wide eyed"" from an emotional mot
her) especially with previous mention of dissociation. Not only that, but out of the 4 styles, it's the one associated with dissociation and I believe a potential precursor to actual dissociative disorders like dissociative identity disorder, etc. What do you think? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl ... n_sectitle ^ I don't expect you to read the article.

174351605,"Just stay away rom PHL professors. I had a global ethics professor tell a class, ""One white man is more creative than 10 Asian men."" The final day he went on a rant about how 'Might makes right"" is actually how ethics works in the real world. He called his students ""snowflakes"". It's a derisive term saying we're fragile.. Every day he would pick on this old man until the old man asked why he always attacked him. It was like warfare! The old man eventually gave up. Irony is that when the professor ws challenged he turned into a snow flake and then picked on that student over and over menial things. That philosophy department was such a wreck. I had another professor pick on me when he was going over sexual evolutionary misfires and uses me for the example. Do you believe that? Maybe it was just my university though. The egos were ****ing crazy there! Left and right I was surrounded my narcissists. One professor my philosophy of mind professor was a wittgensteinian. So I was strapped to a chair 
as he ranted about how all of this philosophy of mind things were just confusions, there is no mystery about it, and gave us _PERSON_ papers. It was hell. It might have triggered my schizophrenia because I was strapped down and was forced to empathize with a professors own frustrations on how we need to give up philosophy and do something more practical. I have had him 2 classes and every day I felt the weight of depression from his classes and his emotions on how we need to give it up. He was genius, but so punishing. I think me and another kid were the only ones who received A's. He got a scholarship and I asked him how he got that, because I never saw him before nor ever at the philosophy club, and we both did Symposium speeches. He said he got the scholarship because he asked for it. I wasn't about to grovel to a professor. By the end of the philosophy of mind class students were in fear of passing so they showed sympathy with his wittgenstien views without understanding the papers the professor gave us. 
He literally made it a herculean task to pass that class because he was frustrated with the subject, trying to groom students to view the problem as he saw it. This is a common thing in philosophy classes. If you share their view, they love you, if you show even disinterested criticism of the teachers cherished beliefs they attack and black ball them."

175962707,"My theory is that having parents/caretakers who are BOTH overbearing AND neglectful will lead to a greater chance of someone developing this condition over time. Many times we think it's either one or the other (overbearing or neglectful). In my own personal case, it was a situation that would swing wildly from overbearing parental dynamics to neglectful parental dynamics. There simply seemed to be no real ""happy medium"". Having said that, I can't blame my parents for my condition. They are simply how they are and whatever happens...happens. I don't know anything different other than being who I am. Certainly, parents will play a role in shaping their children's personality to a certain extent, no doubt. Anyway, feel free to chime in with your thoughts/opinions."

If it starts to be three days in a row then I need to reach out to three friends and have one check on me in the morning, one in the afternoon, one in the evening and call regular T. If that isn’t enough support in three more days then it’s time to go to the hospital. I need to find which psych hospital by me takes my insurance ahead of time so I’m not doing this in a crises. And I need to talk to my three friends ahead of time so that they aren’t freaked out when it happens. And I need to talk to God about suicide being unacceptable behavior.

175962712,"Hello there. I first want to ask you, because I’ve seen the misdiagnosis many times, if you’re sure you don’t have PTSD? Sometimes, if the doctor doesn’t know there’s been a traumatic event, what would be diagnosed as PTSD gets the trifecta GAD, MDD, ADHD diagnosis. If you’re sure, do you know if you’re primarily inattentive type or hyperactive-impulsive? I ask because it makes a difference in coping techniques. Oh and don't sweat the late diagnosis.

The last time I got an ECG, I felt a heart palpitation right while they were checking it and I was like ""Crap this is it.. They'll find something wrong with my heart"" and the doctor is like ""Your heart is completely fine"". Now when I get dissociation or DP/DR, I don't really panic anymore. I just pretend that I'm under the influence of ketamine or psilocybin, take half of a benzo and go to sleep (Cuz my panic attacks only happen in the evening or at night). I do bring the bottle of clonazepam with me everywhere I go though like people do with their inhalers. This summer I had to take a benzo for a full blown dissociative episode at a restaurant.

174351719,"This one is brand new, and thus, exciting to me. Along with the fact that this personality disorder is interesting, seems very intelligent mind-based (and relatable), my motives for this question is I'm looking for a niche that I would be content working with. I was trying to figure out, given so much time spent in the ""mind"" rather than in the ""heart"" or ""present moment"" whether this PD could get mistaken for others who are detached and predisposed to spending more time in their ""heads"" than ""hearts"" I'm not one to be convinced one's nature or biology is the overriding factor of the development of a personality disorder or any other mental illness. Although I'm aware trauma isn't always a factor, I think it is more often than not. That, and environment (things that could be or could have been changed), in relation to mental disorders, is a source of interest for me especially when it comes to criminal activity - but also living in other worlds and odd beliefs (from personality disorder t
o full-on primary psychotic disorder to mania or mental disorders in general). I'm also usually able to hold positive regard, acceptance and dignity for most humans regardless of history, while at the same time, I still have a relatively strong conscience. I'm interested in complexities, creativity, some level of psychosis, trauma, rage, aggression, lack of attachments, unemotional, callousness in connection to all of this. For the life of me, I do not want to work with vulnerable or emotionally injured individuals the way a normal person with ptsd or c-ptsd would express themselves. I don't want to work with people who cannot take care of themselves or those who have slightly different challenges in reasoning such as ASD or FASD or people who are completely out of contact with reality or have a major ID not that there's anything at all wrong with them. My point is invulnerability and ability to fend for selves - and interesting and enjoyable for me. Every symptom of mental disorder I show, is related to copi
ng mechanisms. This also brings be back to wondering about comorbidities of Schizoid PD re: RAD and C-PTSD; however, I'm fully aware everyone is not me. It keeps me curious though. Maybe research. Sounds like an awful lot of boring classes and procedures to learn though"

However, I strongly believe that no matter how advanced psychiatric pills become, no matter how good they get, psychotherapy will always be around. Talk therapy will always exist and will always be needed for lots of people struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety and panic attacks. The reason I believe this is because they'll never be a pill that will solve all your problems and make everything better. Psychotherapy will always be necessary for lots of folks because those with mental illness need to learn how to learn how to cope with their issues, how to make their lifestyles more healthy, and how to replace irrational beliefs with more rational beliefs."

175962736,Had a 5 hour nap after skiing. I drank too much beer and smoked too much light weed. I'll probably still sleep tonight though... I want to change my Invega injection to 100mg every 3 weeks instead of 150mg every 4 weeks + 5mg olanzepine every night. Then I won't be tweaking my meds at all for a long time. They'll be like this; Invega Sustenna 100mg every 3 weeks 5mg Olanzepine every night 50mg Vyvanse every morning 50mg Atenolol every 12 hours 3.25-7.5mg zopiclone at night PRN. Then... THAT'S IT!... 5 med..

175962739,Just put holy water on me.
175962740,My body aches when I wake up as well ever since I lowered the Vyvanse from 50mg to 40mg. Must have something to do with low dopamine and dystonia.

175962749,I understand. I am here if u ever want to talk. Especially on the weekends. The Coronavirus situation is triggering my delusions and hallucinations. I was doing well on the 3mg VRAYLAR until like yesterday. This is just a horrible situation all around. I ordered like 30 items on instacart just now. 27 of them not in stock. Oh well.
175962750,I think it's definitely a possibility. You don't have to have every symptom and the fact that your just degrees of okay means you should really bring it up to your Dr and therapist.
175962751,Something weird happened yesterday I realize. My back barely hurt yesterday. Just once in the morning. Idk why. I’ve been having extremely bad back pain all week (usually every single day) and yesterday...not much at all. Barely any.
175962752,while it is addictive I feel you should be allright if only 3 weeks use. my advice is stop daily use and use it ONLY in a crisis. there is also Xanax xr which is longer acting so you use less in a day. also valium and klonopin are also much longer acting and eaiser to get off of .
175962753,I took my Rx & a multivitamin & a fish oil supplement.

One of the higher ups did some invoicing for me so that was helpful and then the CFO paid some bills for me so I'm glad that they were all cool with helping me out. The doctor at the IP hospital wanted me to stay home from work today and rest, but I wanted to come in because I knew I would have so much stuff piling up. I did call my therapist and got an appointment for tomorrow. What sucks is that I went to the ER for SH. I just needed Possible trigger: some cuts stitched but the ER doctor ended up putting me on a 5150. He was super rude to me. He seemed angry with me. He didn't put enough lidocane when he was going to do the sutures and he made all kinds of remarks. I want to report him I think. I'm tired today. It's hard to sleep IP. Plus I wanted to get out so I was just going to all the classes and all the group therapy that 
I could. And then being sociable as much as I could. We had pizza at lunch at work today and then in about 15 minutes for our 2 o'clock break we are having chocolate cake to celebrate the month's birthdays! I'm glad I didn't miss this today.

Do you increase? 2. A second is, about the 60mg of Prozac anti-depressant which also lowers anxiety. In that, you’ve taken it for years, but 2 months ago you were having anxiety attacks with that med by itself. Has it quit working as _NAME_ thinks? 3. If not Prozac, what substitute medicine? 4. Should you first get on a new med before possibly upping the Buspar? (Also, he may have you on high Prozac (60 mg.), because you wouldn’t take Buspar.) 123"

Then she could have returned home, assess, and have the freedom to choose whether the reality was something she could deal with. But it sounds like you're past that point...?

175962860,"Yes _NAME_ and _PERSON_, I sometimes think if it's an issue of, I don't want to put it this way but, an addiction of worry? Because there were many occasions for me that the worry didn't ease until I found a new thing to worry about. We may chose to believe bad things are happening to us and cause worry but actually it may be all about perception? Hmmm"
175962861,"Wow ok. That's crazy. The first day I took it I slept. Maybe the second day too, but after that I was fine. I think my level of anxiety is so high that I legit cant sleep or calm down. Sometimes benadryl doesnt even work for me. And it's not because of tolerance, cuz most times it works, but if I have anxiety at night I know I'm not gonna sleep for a couple or few days. I know taking haldol shots at the psych hospital in the past (and other meds) they were very surprised when I'd still be awake. I could see the nurses talking to each other and looking in amazement like I was superhuman. I have pretty extreme anxiety. So this job and living on my own and everything is truly a feat for me.

Well I have a lot explanations, but in the bottom, my consern is about, if he dont get help, is going to be very difficult to us to keep it working. I want him to be happy, with or without me, and I think he wants the same. Yesterday we had a talk, he is definitly not going to therapy, he is making his choice, I think if he can make his choice I have the right to choice if I want to stay married. I think this situation of being married is so hard for him as for me, we are like in differents worlds, we see differents realities. And is very hurtful because I love him, and I know he love me, we are trying so herd, but feel like be are pulling in diferent direction."

175962885,"Maybe it has to get worse in therapy in order to get better, but when i was disconnected from emotion life was so much easier, i used to be social, i faked that i enjoyed life but i believed in it, i cant tell how much i enjoyed or loved this kind of life, maybe it was all robotic and i believed whatever i had to believe to keep the show going. Either way now im clingy, 2 hours a week are far from enough to contain the whole week, and the disconnect between the 5 days apart sessions are basicly taking me back to the starting point every single week, and then i need to regain trust and all that $#%^, i feel like only 1 of the 2 meetings is actual therapy, the other one is just me making sure she isn't #######4 me, that she still cares /does she? Anyway so im walking around like a zombie, i cant hold a job because i barely manage to get myself out of the house, every time it takes me 20 minutes to build up the courage to walk out of the door, and the worst part is that i cant contain the emotions, i 
feel bad 70% of my waking hours, at the rest of the time i dont feel, i lay on the floor and do nothing, sometimes i dont even day dream, i just suffer the boredom Idk, this whole thing is too much, oh and on top of all that i sometimes have breakdowns, espacially in my car, it became my safe space because of the control it gives in social settings, i get intance panics with screaming and stuff, not fun"

175962892,"""Bullying"" is a synonym for ""assaulting"", and there are already laws on the books in every jurisdiction in the nation, if not the world, which makes that illegal."" It's not as illegal as you might think. In the state I reside in bullying was made a federal crime 2 years ago and state agencies wouldn't do anything. You can allow it to keep happening the rest of your life or do something that will benefit you as a person and make bullying you something that may end up with them on the floor. I would suggest a martial arts school that suits your taste and style. I'm a purple belt in Shotokan and like the hard style strikes. When I was actively training I considered 3 people against me a fair fight and fought 3 more than once, but that was years ago. I'm still intimating and recently not seen as easy prey by two young guys who thought better of trying whatever they had planned happening outside at 2am on me. Jujitsu and joint manipulation has always interested me and if I get hold of your fingers, 
you're going to ground and they will never be the same. It doesn't take strength, only knowing how they are not supposed to bend and making it hurt comes with it. Either would be good exercise and give your confidence a boost. To do nothing is to accept defeat and you'll be seen an easy mark for anybody with a tendency to pick on those weaker than themselves far into the future. Work to change yourself for the better and learning a formal style to defend yourself is the best advise I can offer. Or learn to love life as a target for those who only pick on people who are weaker than themselves. It won't stop till you look too intimating to try or show them how it feels to be on the receiving end. You will be surprised how much better you feel about yourself afterwards."

175962898,"I'm not posting this on facebook for my mom to see but I'll post it here for why I endured such hell all my teenage life on top of mental illness that manifested at age 12; ""Kids Who Do Chores Are More Successful Adults"" At 15 I started off sanding that ****ing rusty trailer for days. I sanded about 100 things in my teenage life. All I remember is sanding and sanding, 4 hours cutting the grass every few days, days of painting the fence, sweeping and sweeping and sweeping, sanding the counters, vacuuming every certain day (If there was one spot that wasn't done, I'd have to vacuum again), shovelling snow (Like everyone does. Surely not too bad..), sanding the deck for days and then painted, cleaning his truck, cleaning the car, washing the car, vacuuming the vehicles, etc. No friends (Had to blow them all off for fishing trips with this asshole). Worked in the mechanics shop, sweeping and sweeping, cleaning trucks, cleaning his service truck, stealing little things for him to save money, more swee
ping, heavy duty work on trucks (Not allowed to do it myself, I always had to watch.. For years.). I quit, got depressed (Idk why. I. Have. No. Idea). Worked at the welding shop, sweeping and sweeping (Had to start again), moving pieces of metal around, wouldn't let me weld much. I had to buy them packs of cigarettes to drive me home when my mom couldn't drive. I was told to smile and when I put on a fake smile, they'd make fun of me. Then when before he left when I was age 20, I carried all of his weights out into the garage so he could sell. Then he won the lottery. He told me how to scrape spring ice off of the garage doors because I wasn't doing it the way he wanted. I said ""Thanks"" like I always did and he drove away, leaving a mess of barrels that he was using to steal gasoline from oil rigs to save money, garage a mess full of rags, small oil barrels, broken pieces of heavy machinery, **** everywhere. That was the last I saw of him. But I spent my whole childhood up to age 12 playing outside so maybe 
this article is right."

175962900,"I feel 100x better after having a walk with my mom and her friends. They said I'm doing extremely well and I feel well. I think it's because of the 1.5g phenibut (I'm tolerant to 1g). It's a nootropic and acts like a stimulant in the day and a sedative when I'm in REM sleep (It's a GABA-B agonist like GHB - Brand name ""Xyrem"" for narcolepsy). When I don't take it, my mood makes a 180 degree turn and I even lose my sense of humour.. My whole personality.. Especially at the start of the injection.. But today is the best I've ever felt while at the start of the injection... The walk and socialization helped. When I got home, I scraped the ice off of the sidewalks which was another workout and made me breathe heavily. Then I had a shower and did general hygiene. I had a cold shower too to wake me up. The only thing I don't have is extroverted intuition where I think about the future. I'm just thinking about the moment right now. Phenibut is a good antidepressant for me but can be addictive so I would
n't recommend for anyone else. I'm gonna make another coffee (I had one at the place I walked to) but I feel ok. The 100mg Seroquel and Invega Sustenna injection actually makes me feel better + the Vyvanse kicked in more (It peaks at 3 hours). I'm ok I just miss the crazy thoughts. Thanks for the insight everyone! One day they will make antipsychotics that even 'normal' people will want to take to improve their cognition."

My brother in law once told my husband when he first started out as an electrician and was looking at a huge complex of buildings to wire not to look at the whole project, but instead focus on one building at a time. He lives by that every day 40 years later. Take one thing that is in your control and scratch it off the list. Things that are semi in your control, like health issues means taking your meds, getting some exercise if you can, taking care of yourself the best you can. If you're worried about a colostomy leak, which is a possibility, make sure you are always prepared with a kit for such things. It won't be the end of the world if it happens if you are prepared for it. As far as worrying about things that are not in your control, Jesus said it best at _NAME_ 6: 25, 34 “On this account I say to you: Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not life mean more than food and t
he body than clothing? So never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Each day has enough of its own troubles. In other words, as my Mom always likes to say, don't go borrowing trouble. The things beyond our control are of no use to us expending energy and anxious worry about when there is nothing we can do about the outcome either way. See if there's something in your life that brings you hope, even if it's just playing with the pup for a bit or the beautiful orchids you have. Fixing up the house little by little and not getting weighed down in the details. One step at a time."

When we have low self esteem it is easy to think of ourselves as unattractive in many ways. Even though in life, looks really don't matter. It comes from what is inside a person, how they act. Are they kind? If your girlfriend undermines you and tries to make you feel bad about yourself, I would think it is her problem. She feels beneath you and is jealous.. Normal people don't go around hurting their friends. Being told you didn't fit the look does not mean anybody thinks you are ugly. You just weren't what they were looking for. There are many different looks with people. And... Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. What one person finds attractive isn't necessarily what the next person finds attractive. I hope you stop putting so much stock in appearances. Really, what is on the outside doesn't really matter. Sure it is nice to look good, but really the true beaut
y comes from inside. How you treat others. I hope you talk to somebody. I think you would feel better about yourself. Also as SC stated, check out resources at the top of the page... You sound like a good person. I hope you feel better soon. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175962976,"Anyone else, when they start getting manic, you have few seconds of brilliancy? Like for me, every once and awhile, I feel brilliant. I'll think of something really brilliant like about how the world is. But then it immediately goes away. It literally only lasts for a split second."
175962977,Retail therapy is working wonders! I bought an external DVD drive so I can watch DVDs on my new laptop since it doesn't have one built in.
175962978,Bf just emailed the whole team some random email.....lol luckily it wasn’t a bad one where he was complaining lol
175962979,"You mention being very anxious: “Hi there, I’m so anxious right now I don’t know what to do” “Yes it is definitely my thinking, I do recognize the problem but, how do I change those ? I mean I have try to accept Then and remember that they are just thoughts but still make me afraid” “I’m still worried about everything and what if I developed a new illness? What if I am depressed? What if I never get better? What if’s are just so bad lately."" ""Willing to try everything to get better ...this is debilitating me” From there my anxiety went so bad...every day is like what if? Why do these thoughts come to my mind? And fear comes to my mind."" ""I truly believe this fear is all part of this pandemic ...realizing that we are so vulnerable you know, ...I went to the new therapist who recommended CBT, I have never actually tried it ..."" ""I think I am getting what you re saying ...I mean things that have happened to me make me more scare of the same situations again. For example I am 
kinda of feeling better about the covid situation and then I hear there is going to be another lockdown and I start very anxious. I mean look at what that situation has brought us already you know."" As far as where the anxiety comes from, you said: ""Yes I mean I love my family it’s just that they are anxious too"" So you’ve spoken of anxiety quite a bit. Webmd.com says the symptoms of that are: • Feeling nervous, restless or tense; Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom; • Having increased heart rate; Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation); Sweating; Trembling Do you have that? The website also listed several types of anxiety, one was called; Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. You said your therapist t
hought you might be depressed and suggested you talk with your doctor. The symptoms of depression for women are (healthline.com): • mood, such as irritability • emotional well-being, such as feeling sad or empty, anxious or hopeless • behavior, such as loss of interest in activities, withdrawing from social engagements; cognitive abilities, such as thinking or talking more slowly • sleep patterns, such as difficulty sleeping through the night, waking early, over sleeping; • physical well-being, such as decreased energy, greater fatigue, changes in appetite, weight changes, aches, pain, headaches, increased cramps Do you have that? As for medicines, you said were taking Citalopram anti-depressant, 20 mg., which net said was the initial starting dosage. verywellmind website says about that medicine: “By reducing the rate at which serotonin is reabsorbed, Celexa (Citalopram) changes the brain chemistry, improving mood and reducing feelings of anxiety. Celexa can assist in decreasing the severity of p
anic attacks and other panic disorder symptoms. So, your medicine seems to be very good. It's an anti-depressant which also helps with ""reducing anxiety."" It my view, it may need to be increased. You might want to bring some of this up with your doctor at your next appointment. These are just my views as someone who also has emotional problems with bipolar. You can look up these and other topics, also, by typing them into the search engine, which is where I found them. 12"

175962982,"Yeah definitely a bad idea. But I like doing it anyway lol I'm glad to see you around, have been wondering how you've been doing"
175962983,if you're on a bus journey you don't get off before you get where you're going just because no one else gets on the bus. i feel i've made progress on my sz journey since i started posting on this forum. i subscribe to same page favouritism to help with any frustration that comes when the buck often passes. i try and carve a niche i can sustain in conjunction with my sz. i subscribe to watching box sets with the mute button on and also listening to tech tunes. media access points are like wireless chargers for the public to energise and help to keep favouritism on the same page. adjusting could be like blended aspects with education and nurturing mixed with the sz symptoms mentioned in this thread.
175962984,I'm exhausted and laying down. Brain overload.
174352090,Ever hear people argue if sz or bp is worse. I find that annoying. Comparing mental illness. It’s different for everyone and it’s hard to put people in a nice box. What do you get when you mix both? You get sza... they have a better prognosis than sz and bp has a better prognosis than sza.
175962985,"In short yes, online and offline. I kept all the online evidence like the youtube videos of _NAME_ and TI Television trying to put across a fake narrative that I was not involved with, along with the fake victims accounts asking for assistance via Phishing e-mails, I have screenshots of mobbing and abuse taken from mousetrap forums, again they were hearing voices, TI, Mental Health-related. Also, have a fake support group performing perp tactics upon a Zoom conference earlier during the year. So, that was the online stuff, offline I've been subject to a suspected smear campaign locally, suffer from street theatre when going out, some times it's more overt than others. Had set's attempts been made by unethical social workers, looking to cut my living allowance, been mobbed at attempts to volunteer at different organizations; and lastly the EH, V2K itself. I could name a few people though what would be the point here! So, yes it's been a long campaign, I know have my so-called family group gaslightin
g me during UK lockdowns. laughing and mocking, shouting at night outside my bedroom window, some strange pulsed light be been through it which crazily enough seems to have an effect upon my person. ( still trying to work that one out) So, there is a small taster."
175962986,"I'm considering, at the moment, taking a hiatus from job searching. And then not only work on my writing and building my fanbase, but doing college that I signed up for, for digital marketing. And then see what I can do for my book from learning new marketing skills. What do u guys think? I feel so stressed out right now because of job searching. It's that one thing in the back of my mind that I just dont want to think about."

175962988,"I have no idea, it seemed pretty quiet to me today."
175962989,Thank you and I hear where you are coming from. I'm leaning that way. I'm working on forgiveness. My main thing is I don't want to be hurt again.

175962993,I hate that nothing's going on. I hate that the world seems to no longer be functioning correctly. Whatever that means. I hate being alone. I feel depressed later on in the day. I just feel better in the morning for whatever reason. Life honestly sucks right now.
175962994,"Hi _PERSON_, So sorry to hear about your struggles and you are definitely not alone. But you are to be commended for seeking advice instead of going through it alone. I read this quote recently that I thought was very true and encouraging. “Anxiety in a … heart weighs it down, but a good word cheers it up.” I addition to seeking professional help here are a few simple things you can try that you may find helpful. Set appropriate goals/priorities Have realistic expectations Regular exercise and enough sleep I find that taking care of my spiritual and physical health helps me to improve my mental health."

175963000,"I know during my ups and downs while dealing with depression sometimes an old picture reminds me of what is important in my life, or my granddaughter hug and kiss, let me know that she loves me and missing me when I am not myself.

175963005,"I am so incredibly bored. I’ve been up since 6. Finished working, took a shower, did 2 loads of laundry, and now I’m on the couch with Netflix and a box of Crunch n’ Munch. My husband has been out of work for 10 days. He’s been medically signed out until the 8th. He hurt his neck again somehow about a month ago and it’s just not improving.

I think only my supervisor knows about my disorder because I put it on the application since it was required to apply. Not required to disclose but required to tell your story in some way, so I put it in there."

175963007,"_PERSON_ (kjodwyer) said... The sort of mindfulness I have found helpful is when I find myself engaging in continuous negative thoughts - by focusing on the task I am doing in detail this activates (so I am told) a more frontal part of the brain as opposed to the deeper brain area where negative thoughts originate and this breaks the cycle. That is an EXCELLENT example of how someone can CHOOSE something to help them self verses simply giving in to negative thoughts! Often times people give in to negative thinking and simply feel they have no say in how they are thinking but the MIND is your BEST tool to use if you simply choose to use it~ you can over power *negative* thinking but it does take practice and an awareness that it's happening again. Over time it becomes much easier and you can stop those *negative* thought much quicker! So it's awesome that on your own you have discovered this tool. Meditation is something that MOST people do at least once or twice daily~ They focus on thoughts that m
ake them feel good~ some chat~ There are a wide variety of ways to meditate and I know several of the members here incorporate that into their daily routines so if your looking for suggestions concerning what to do or how to mediate may I recommend that you post to _PERSON_. She's the Assistant Manager here at *Hearts* and the Master Mind of *Hearts* Web Page here~ I know she is someone who mediates daily and finds it very helpful to her own well being PLUS someone that I personally can attest to, that will do her best to be of help to you. There are MANY other ways you can stop yourself from going to dark places in your mind. If you look thru the many folders here at *Hearts* many of those methods/tips that people use to help their own self are posted in those folders. If you need any help finding something simply post and ask and we will do our best to find what your looking for.

175963008,"Oh man. I’m waiting for the bus to go home for the grocery store. I was waiting in line and someone suggested to me to go to the self checkout since I didn’t have a ton of stuff. So I went reluctantly and probably made a fool of myself getting all flustered trying to do it with my anxiety, not knowing how exactly to do it, and trying to keep my mask falling off (which is why I need a new one) anyway, I did it."
175963009,Boy that sucks. Is there any medication or anything that can help? Sometimes when I have a migraine I will use heat or ice on my head and it helps. I don't know if you have tried that for your frontal lobe. I'm sorry you have to go through this every month.
175963010,That and the apt not being upgraded. But idk cuz I've had bouts of depression for a few days now.

175963013,"As I understand it, extroverts recharge by social interactions and, by contrast, introverts recharge by isolation. During these trying times, those of us who are introverts should take consolation in the fact that we're the ones who can best endure the recommended self-isolation. It's almost like our routines have not changed that much. Unfortunately for extroverts, they feel more at a loss with decreased physical interaction. I believe I am an introvert, or more accurately, an extroverted introvert: I often try to ""push"" myself out more to try to present a ""balance"" in my personality. At this time, I feel I can relax the ""pushing"""

I am now on the other side and I couldn’t be happier other than I still struggle with negative thoughts and worry about my daughters health. I have found the most loving, giving, caring man and I am happier in this marriage than I ever was in my first marriage. Take it one day at a time. You got this!

175963020,Was listening to a _NAME_ rogan experience podcast about the police. I'm not very interested in police. I know it's a mess and corrupt in the US so idk. I then found a podcast about Dr. _PERSON_ (He went deep into talking about homeless peoples experiences with addiction in Vancouver etc and has a lot of good insights about addiction) so I'll watch that later. Right now made chamomile tea. I forgot how well it works for my anxiety so I'll be drinking it more often. I'm listening to songs that I listened to while in Guatemala. I made a playlist of those songs and they give a really neat vibe of being there. It was basically the only time I felt happy when I was a teenager - Those 3 weeks. I want to read a story about someones experience in Guatemala so I'm gonna find a book about it. Then maybe read about Mayan/Aztec civilization. I'll try and read something that I feel like reading and kind of ignore everything else - It will help with depression.
175963021,"You're imaginated hallucinations of a real event of a university in the past is like watching a painful movie. But you have to watch it.. The brain forces you to do it so you can sort it all out.. I remember what the soldiers and crypto investors said on the video chat.. Humans remember emotions of faces and for you, those faces were of disgust which makes you feel fear and shame.. (All for the wrong reasons) so you need to use your rational thought brain to analyse it.. No emotions! They are useless right now! Unless I'm thinking of this completely in my head and I'm wrong.. If I am, I am speaking for your subconscious mind that you can't feel.. So you just get background static... Maybe which is the cause of the numbness.. The more numb you feel, it crystalizes.. So whatever you can feel, feel it. I feel more again. You know why.. Lower antipsychotic numbing chems, past use chems that are the opposite.. But I'm afraid of losing my mind. I might lose my mind."

175963025,How was the interview SP?
175963026,"Yes, it is. I know of a case of this, and I think it is only online. The group has up to 2 hours live stream every week. They lampoon and ridicule the target, it's hard to describe. The target is a registered sex offender, so no one cares if he finds out or is bothered. Again, it's only online as far as I know, and I don't want to identify any of them, not like I know who they are anyway. It just surprised me when I found out."

Sounds like you are getting to know what to expect. Though I hope that she doesn't leave for your sake. Though you know her much better than anybody I imagine. I am sorry you are going through this. I think I mentioned my mother was bi-polar. She use to be very abusive and hard to live with. It was very unsettling to me as I was just a kid. I would get scared to come home from school to find them fighting. So I kind of know how you feel. You dread it. I hope that things get better. Let us know what is going on. We are all here for you.

175963032,"Cross posted on FB I found a post i made on a website a few years after i was released from the troubled teen facility i was put in against my will at age 16 (2003-2004). This doesn't even scratch the surface of the things i went through and saw at this facility. #BreakingCodeSilence Here is another quote from a survivor over on Cafety: ""I was in the lockdown unit for the first 4 months and in the cabins (in the winter) for the remainding 4 months. The lockdown unit is one room with 12 beds in it. You are not allowed to look up from the floor at anyone entering or leaving the unit. You are not allowed to look at other patients or talk to them. You have to sit in the middle of your bed all day, back to the wall, no sleeping, eyes open. If you are seen by another patient breaking a rule (which i never understood as you aren't supposed to be looking at other patients) you are then confronted by the whole group and are given a consequence. When I was on STU (the lockdown unit) I was restrained countle
ss times. The very first time I was restrained on the bed, I had these huge mitts on my hands to keep myself from picking at my fingers. I will not deny that I had been harming myself by picking at my fingers. The nurse on charge put bandages on all of my fingers. As I was in my bed with these huge mitts on and bandages, I was touching the ends of my fingers to see if the blood was still flowing to the tips of my fingers as the bandages were way to tight. A staff saw me doing this and literally jerked me onto the floor as those horrible sirens went off. They hoisted me up onto the bed after about 5 minutes of holding me down (I wasn't resisting as i was terribly frightened). As they were strapping my legs and arms into the bed net I remember (and will never forget) the words that the staff said to me. She said ""We are not doing this to hurt you."" ALl i could think about at that time was why am i being strapped to this bed. I will never forget these moments. In the cabins we live in a small cabin with 12 bun
k beds. We slept in our own sleeping bags as it was winter. There was no electricity in the cabin. There was one lightbulb over the staffs desk that was lit by a car battery. The cabin was heated by one woodstove in the center of the cabin. We were forced to clean every place we visited, (the YC, the bathhouse, the cabin) numerous times. If there were over 5 specks of dirt found in the location, we were made to clean it all over again. Repeat process if more dirt was found. Sometimes we spent the whole day cleaning the YC while the staff sat in the chair and watched. One patiend that was there was always vomiting her food up. She threw up in the woodpile and they made her clean it up. She even resorted to vomiting in the vent in the school bathroom. After a month it was discovered and they just ended up giving her a grocery bag to carry around and vomit in whenever she wanted. IF she vomited in the bag she had to carry it around with her until the staff said she could dispose of it. Is this sanitary??? NO. Ev
entually this girl passed out in the toilet and was taken to the hospital, probably from severe dehydration. Girls were put in straight jackets and walked around all day. We had to carry around bags of sand as a consequence. Our consequences as a group got so backed up that we had to wake up at 5am and do over 200 push ups for weeks. I was pretending to be asleep one night and I overheard the staff making fun of a few patients. When i told my mom about this in treatment i was brushed off by my therapist as being manipulative and lying to get attention. there were so many things that happened that i would love to forget, as they still give me nightmares to this day. I am 20 years old now.I have No doubt that this is life changing."""

175963034,A lot of pastry chefs are men....maybe they just see it as work not play?
175963035,I think your happiness is worth more than a job and I'm pretty sure your family would agree. We get so caught up in a job and sometimes you need personal time. Its not healthy to be at a place you hate. You can take leave from your job. Just get a medical excuse. Tell your doctor exactly how you feel that you need time away from your job. They will get you medical leave. My friend did it for her job. And just take that time to relax or look for another job. But honestly you are worth more than a job. Jobs come and go. But you are what's important.
175963036,I felt happy and then sad then happy and now really really sad. But it's ok. I noticed that I get dysphoric depression and euphoric depression. I wish my mom stuck to teaching me piano. I love piano I'm starting to realize. And I'm like an autistic savant with music - I can play by ear. I'm gifted in music she says. Same with my dad. That's why he gave me his 10 thousand dollar guitar. My mom was a piano teacher. And I can't play piano. It's not too late right? I just regret so much and keep thinking about the past. I was really dealt a ****** card. I just want to play music at least. But I accomplished nothing in life - Yet want to end it sometimes - Known for nothing and it's just another tragedy for my mom. She knows what she's doing. I don't blame her for anything - She's the best mother in the world. But I feel like I came second to her relationships and her obsessive compulsive cleaning. All of a sudden my anhedonia is gone and I feel emotions. I'm not sure why. I guess this was just the way i
t was meant to be.

175963045,"MMB, It sounds like AH is having an acute bout of anxiety due to situational stressors that are happening in his life atm. I think his daily Rx usually performs well for him. S.C."
175963046,How do you read with the book bouncing around everywhere?
175963047,Might smoke a little marijuana then shovel the snow

175963052,I know--I am like a 5 year-old here!! 3 pm. Do you think I could feed him a little tiny amount of salmon safely?
175963053,Lol!!! That's good!
175963054,Yeah I guess most people hang out over on Snapchat now
174352165,"Hey everyone. I'm not doing very well. I'm not sure what emotion I should feel right now. I'm really confused and frustrated, filled with fear and humiliation, basically devastation.

I know they were running a pilot project on it and they’re getting some traction later this week hoping to have a lot of us set up soon. I guess eventually I will be able to, but as of this week it’s not an option. They’re trying to keep us informed on it. I’m not the only on thinking about it."

175963063,"I dont think its pizza. I think it's because I ate pretty darn healthy for like 3 weeks and then I binged on pizza. Cuz i was making like lots of rice, and a lot of meals that were vegetable based. Like spaghetti squash and cauliflower rice. And I was eating a lot of greens, fruit/veggies, and white meat."
175963064,The end of last year was a really good year for me but I don't remember much. I'm gonna make a memory journal again starting tonight for today.
175963065,I don't know what my therapist told my psych but now my psych wants to see me in person this week instead of waiting till our appointment at the end of march. So I will be seeing her. I don't know why it has to be in-person suddenly for this particular appointment. She said she wants to see how the med increase is going. But I don't know why we have to go over that immediately this week and in person
175963066,Thanks for your input..been at least 10 yrs.. I think im due ...just got my PPI med..day 2 on it..and Gaviston...and making a list of food I can tolerate...CT coming up as well as I ended in Emerg...Baby steps..heal my stomach and then see if makes a difference with my back...(like tag team with pain)..

175963068,"Feeling tired today. And bored. I'm at work but yeah, not much happening. Although I wouldn't be doing much at home either. I filled out the paperwork to see the new psychologist. I have to mail it to him I guess as I am going to see him telehealth. Not sure how this is all going to work out."
175963069,"My cat _NAME_ seems to be doing good on the antibiotic and the other meds. She has to go in on Thursday to get her blood glucose checked again because last time the Frutosomine test showed it was kind of high. It's cause she likes to snack so she snacks all day and it's hard for the insulin to work right that way. She's like me though, we're snackers."

175963073,"hey everyone, been reading posts for close to 2 years now and I never posted. But I am having a hard time with at home stress and anxiety and what I think are severe panic attacks. I take Lexapro 15mg daily to help with symptoms but I feel it doesn't do much for when I panic. I have ulcerative colitis and being out in public gives me anxiety and certain situations make me panic, heart rate up to 170's (apple watch reads this). I never use to panic like this but now even walking up to a restaurant to eat with my own father brings on high heart rate and anxiety.. I know that I need to get my colitis under control but is there any other meds/recommendations anyone has for panicking, especially over things I use to do with no problem? I have been to my doctors office 100 times without anxiety but now once I get into the parking lot I feel like I need to hurry up get out the car and do something. thank you everyone"
175963074,"And by recreational drugs, I mean stuff like meth, heroin, opioids, etc."
175963075,I feel depression when I drink alcohol. Take a PRN antipsychotic if you have one. You could ask the doctor/psychiatrist for baclofen to help with alcohol cessation. Like 10-15mg a day.
175963076,Are you ok with enough food? I worry about you.
175963077,I like to keep my friends as close to me as possible but not all of them are going to be there long but sometimes some friends last years when when they stop talking to you years later. I have very few friends I trust right now.
175963078,"There’s no “quick fix” way to develop a more positive outlook. Changing this sort of thing takes a real effort. But it’s possible. A gratitude practice can help. Every night, write down one or two things you are grateful for. Volunteer service can help too. Social interaction can help. Harder these days but not impossible. Exercise can help. A real desire to change one’s outlook helps."
175963079,"My cousin came to visit to bring my mom CBD. She talks a lot. I like people who talk a lot. I'm gonna show her around town and the weed store. She was talking to me about weed because she works for a medical marijuana dispensary to do writing. She recently got her bachelors of science. She's answering all the questions that I have about marijuana. Other than that, I'm feeling better than yesterday and the day before. My mixed state is mostly gone."
174352189,"I took my work schedule and erased some hours which I was available. I hope they don't ask me to change it. I was waking up at 4:40 am to do my 6 am classes. I basically don't want to do this anymore. I do have one 6 am class but it is not that bad. I will tweak my schedule some more to prevent them from giving me classes too early in the morning. I don't want to wake up to some ornery student who is hellbent on making my day miserable. I had enough of those type of students. Otherwise, I'm doing well today. Life is not bad!!"

175963081,"I'm sorry you're feeling that way. I sometimes feel similarly about walking outside. It's like a good idea, but it seems to pass me by when I'm in depression. Anything's really a good idea when I'm in a depressed state (I'm talking about so-called ""positive"" coping strategies). But honestly sometimes it's too hard to go through with them. I personally feel like (and I'm sure everyone agrees with the fact that) you're a real part of the community here so don't forget that. You give good advice and support and all of that so don't forget that you have that capacity to help people. Maybe try to give that same support to yourself? I don't know. It's tough. I bought a book on self-compassion one time. That seems to help me."

175963084,"Hi _PERSON_ and welcome! I am sorry to hear of your health anxiety challenges. I can relate as this is my main issue as well. So you have been on your Rx for about a month, with one increase...up from 5 mg I am assuming? Unfortunately with an A/D the symptoms that we experience with anxiety can get worse before things start to turn around and improve. (and the therapeutic dose for you is reached) You are perhaps a third to half way through your break in period with your new med. This can be a challenging time, but one that is temporary...and made easier with coping skills. Please see our Resources at the top of our main forum page here for great self help material that you can get started on today. There is material specifically on help for health anxiety there...as well as general stress relieving exercises to learn and practice. These will help if your work them regularly. Keep posting with us as well if you find it helpful. We understand, care and support is key! Talk soon, S.C."
175963085,try taking morning vs bedtime. what dose are you taking? i started on 10mg. works great for me. no anxiety at all.

175963089,"Hi Schizological1 . Number230000 : Unfortunately the idea that academic researchers spend a lot of time alone is not an accurate stereotype. I know some get away with it, but it's very rare to be both reclusive and successful. And success does matter, even for little things like having a nice quiet office. I can't be too detailed without giving away personal details, but academic research work involves: - talking to the admin staff (you have to be friendly to the admin staff or life gets very hard very quickly) - informal chats with the junior researchers to answer questions and keep them on track - meetings to help students or postgrad researchers navigate the university - meetings with other staff about students or postgrad researchers - supervision meetings with my own PhD candidates - telephone calls with industry partners - emails with or about any of the above - coffee with collaborators or potential future students or researchers - talks by other staff or postgrads (with associated mingling) 
- teaching (with associated talking to students before and after class) - committee meetings Not all of those happen every day, but a typical day can have quite a few. And that's when not actively trying to put together or run a project. Projects add a lot more meetings. I'm sure there are jobs that don't require a lot of talking to people, but academic researcher isn't one of them."

I was attempting to help by way of sharing information that a trained professional bug sweeper ex army specialist could assist with by way of detection and removal.

175963102,That sucks. Some people are “fair weather” friends. Around when things are good and they only need to smile...anyone can do that. It takes a lot to form a true friendship. That’s why I really only have one outside relationship that I foster. That’s with my bestest. She’s the only person I bother with when times are tough. She’s got me and I’ve got her. Anyone else in my life is more like a condiment...take em or leave em. Nice to see and chat with but that’s about it. I wouldn’t count on them for anything more than that

175963104,"I would like to recommend a book called The Transformation by Dr. _NAME_. He starts with the assumption that we all have trauma, to varying degrees. His chapters guide you through evidence-based techniques to quiet your anxiety and depression. I have downloaded the audiobook and listen to a chapter at a time, pausing frequently to go through the exercises, from breathing to dancing to writing and visualizing. His chapters on the relation of food to mind-body health are worth reading alone. I guess what I'm trying to offer you is a way to help yourself, while hopefully you also seek help from a psychologist and/or psychiatrist. You've done the necessary first step: by ruling out organic illness and defining that you have issues that require attention. Now you are at the beginning of tackling those really difficult issues to make progress to being the person you want to be. It won't be easy, but it is absolutely possible. Good luck."

174352237,"Hello! I've been newly diagnosed ""Schizoaffective Disorder: Bipolar Edition"", and I've been a little nervous to talk to anyone about it. I am receiving help, and am fairly capable of handling myself so I'm not afraid on that front. My psychiatrist says that I'm very good at managing myself, and that I was employing reframing therapy on my own already. I'm looking for long term treatment therapeutically for my experiences, but it still feels so unreal. I don't hear voices, but I sense presences (Often malicious), and experience really intense and vivid, almost intrusive imagery in my head? I've spent a fair amount of my life feeling bugs all over my body (I thought it was normal, so I didn't talk to anybody about it. That's a whole story to explain.), but more recently it's gotten really bad (I lived in an apartment for a year that was infested with bugs and had to sleep in a bed which was infested and it was just, a lot to deal with. It made me realize the sensations were completely indiscernible 
from the real thing.) which sparked me reaching out for help. The doctor approved me to try my plan for care (Talk-therapy first, and if that doesn't alleviate the bug sensations, then I'll try medicine.), but it still just feels weird to use the term ""Schizoaffective Disorder"". I always figured that you had to actually physically SEE and HEAR the hallucinations to be diagnosed with that kind of thing. The sensations of bugs are really vivid, though, so that part makes sense. I also experience delusions of grandure (Where I feel in my lil' heart of hearts that I'm a creature from outside of this reality, or that I'm famous, ect..) and delusions of paranoia where I think everyone around me hates me/is disgusted by me if they aren't explicitly being positive towards me. Even so, I know cognitively that the experiences aren't real, and it's just very exhausting emotionally. It's like I've been strapped into a ride and even though I know I won't fall off, the twists and turns still feel like I'm gonna fall off, 
and one part of my brain is trying to tell the other to stop screaming about it. You know? I think the bipolar portion of the diagnosis is because I sometimes have restless spells of activity where I can't, for the life of me, sleep. My brain has to Do The Thing and I end up just kind of stuck inside the passenger seat making plans to keep it from wrecking my general schedule. I guess what I'd like to ask is, was anyone else surprised to get the diagnosis? Was anyone else worried about trying to talk to other people about it? I have some solid people I'm comfortable talking about it with, and I have reached out to my circle, but it's not really a diagnosis I want to shout to the rooftops. Does my experience sound like the real deal, or is it possible that what I'm experiencing isn't Schizoaffective? I'm going to get a second opinion from my therapist when I get one (Already sent the email to my doctor, so I'm on top of my treatment plan.), but it still feels weird. I know it shows up differently for everyone, 
and it won't look the same way in two different people, but a lot of resources mention hearing voices, and I just don't hear voices. I've been reading up on it. Also, it's nice to meet everyone!"
175963107,Beautiful SP
175963108,Talked to a couple of friends last night and this morning about my feelings about the hospitalization. Got some good responses. Don't feel as alone now.
175963109,So why not use a laundromat or laundry service and hire a walker for the dogs? The housing market is super tight right now and those two things will be far cheaper than leasing a house. I know this isn’t what you want to hear but most of us can not afford a house so we make compromises.
175963110,I'm tired today. I didn't sleep well. I had cramps last night which kept me up. I'm going to Church this morning then I'm going to try to do some Christmas shopping. I'm overwhelmed by it all really. I'm glad I have Thanksging and Black Friday off. I'm not looking forward to work tomorrow though. I so need a break. Oh well. Hugs all _PERSON_
175963111,mmmmm. You are making me want cinnamon rolls!
175963112,Check out some _PERSON_. There is lots of it available online. It always helps me feel better. He is so practical and wise and is almost always happy. A hero of mine.
175963113,"Saw my pdoc on Wednesday afternoon via telemedicine. The program he uses is called ""Telehealth"" by better practice or something like that. It was the first time using that program, for me. I logged on about 5 minutes before my appointment. I was in the lower right corner of the screen. But at least I looked better on that picture than I do on Skype or Zoom. _PERSON_ got on about 5 minutes after the hour, so I had waited about 10 minutes (whereas I used to wait hours in his office waiting room). We talked. Both Regular _PERSON_ and Pastor _PERSON_ wanted me to tell him about a so-called delusion I'm having. I say so-called because despite everyone telling me it's a delusion, I'm not sure that it is. Anyway, he didn't argue with me. He just listened. He said, well, it's a delusion. But then he said, you're on the right medication for it. He did a short diagnostic sort of scale for depression to see where my depression levels are at and they are amazingly better than three months ago (his words). He 
said I made his day! It wasn't the same seeing him on the screen as in person, mostly because I miss my hug! But the technology was pretty smooth. He only froze maybe once. I didn't have trouble hearing him or anything. He reminded me to make my next appointment on the portal. So I did. The bad thing is that he is so expensive. $200 for 15 minutes and he doesn't take insurance. But I still feel like he is worth it. I emailed Pastor _PERSON_ who wanted to know how the appointment went so I told him. He said that sounded good. I'm not sure to what he referred to exactly from my email but I assumed that meant things were good. Hopefully we don't have to keep talking about this delusion because I don't think I'm going to give it up anytime soon and I doubt that others are going to stop telling me it is a delusion any time soon."
175963114,"Hey, not that i have experience to tell you what to do but I think that if you know what you want to do, you should do it. At least you know, for example me, I have no clue what I want to do with my future. What I going to say is boring motivational talk but still maybe it's right, maybe it isn't, it won't be easy but if it's what you want it won't be as confusing."

175963118,"Week 3 and the nodes are still swollen. They seem to increase and decrease in size. At the end of the day they're almost bean sized. At the beginning of the day, they're teeny tiny but still there. I'm taking an anti b for my sinus infection (the 4th one this year). I've read/heard of people having this issue for years and never having it figured out so idk. Between the nodes being swollen and these constant sinus infections, my mind has definitely gone to dark places."
175963119,"I sleep at 11pm-12am and wake up at 11am. If I slept like even 6-7 hours a night, I'd just go psychotic. Lack of sleep is the biggest trigger for psychosis for me. I stayed up for 36 hours or so last year and I seemed so cognitively impaired that I never did it again."

My parents vehemently disagree with that. I know I shouldn't be causing conflict, but it seems to me like my doctor is so ""hands-off"" these days, and that really makes me angry. Like I know what's right for me. I know that I hate olanzapine because it makes me feel like a zombie. I know the side effect of zombie-feeling is not worth it, either, because it infiltrates every facet of my life. The only weird thing I get off of olanzapine is feeling like my face looks weird on video calls. So that's a little bit concerning. It looks like a weird face, like it's divided strangely at my nose. Is that a weird symptom? My therapist is doesn't seem to like the fact that I feel like a zombie on olanzapine. She thinks I should be more expressive, or something like that. Maybe she just doesn't understand me yet... I wish my meds could be radically 
simplified. I know it's probably bad to be on two atypical antipsychotics, so why does my doctor continue on this regimen for me? I don't get it. Oh and I also stupidly threw out the olanzapine that I had. That was a poor idea. Now, even if I needed it, I can't get it until Monday probably."

175963143,"Morning I’m ok, kinda. Took my meds and had coffee. Still waiting for certain emails before I can move forward with certain things like school and some other stuff. Waiting for my tax return too, and disability, to pay my rent and stuff. I put some money towards my debt yesterday but only 70 dollars. It’s a process... Thinking about sewing stuff to sell on _PERSON_ in my downtime away from work. But I have no fabric. I’d hate to invest in fabric and then idk, not have time to do it or the want anymore. I have to think about it. I shouldn’t do stuff like buy a bunch of clothes or stupid stuff with my refund for sure. I’ve been bored with quarantine, lately."
175963144,"I think I had some sort of psychosis last night. I took two clonazepam, two zopiclone, phenibut and a 5mg olanzepine. The things about culture that I'm reading right now - I don't care about anymore but I thought I was losing my mind. I feel a little scared right now and paranoid but not as much as last night."
175963145,That's so cute! I always wanted a huge plushie! I hope you'll enjoy it!!!!
175963146,Great job Rich.... I get out and walk two laps around part of my neighborhood... I'm generally out at 4:30'ish in the morning... Everything is so peaceful and quiet. Since you're on a roll - see if you can go out again this week.
175963147,"Hello friends! It’s been a couple of weeks since I last posted. Just wanted to provide an update on my lex journey for the fifth time being on it in my life on 5mg. It’s been a roller coaster for sure. When I started the med I felt immediate relief within the first few days. It was great. Then around week 2 anxiety returned due to my menstrual cycle and hormones. Once that was done I went back to feeling good. Now it’s week 8 and I’ve been feeling so emotional and anxious all week, but I am also going through some marital problems that triggered it all. Things within my marriage are starting to settle down so I’m praying to god I go back to the anxiety free days. I would really hate to possibly up my dose"

I asked for restaurant to make me breakfast and felt anxious about asking for that. Hopefully I NEVER get depersonalization/derealization at work.. that would be terrible..

175963156,HI. HT
175963157,"I may have gone on a tangent there. I'm trying to figure out if there's some possible connection between the obsessions some people with OCD face and schizotypal ""odd beliefs"" Some people may wonder if they've have hit and killed someone with their vehicle without realizing it. From there, they can work themselves into a state where they become close to convinced they actually have - and from there, they can swing over to questioning maybe they did it on purpose and they're ""morally corrupt"" Yeah, I don't fully know where I was going with that question - other than maybe someone who may have unwelcomed thoughts of brutally murdering their wife that they love, thoughts they can't fend off. As a result, maybe they question if they're evil or being possessed which, in turn, may lead to beliefs such as if they watch movies with anything occult-ish in them, it will draw evil spirits towards them and force them to actually act on those intrusive thoughts. Maybe they believe coming into contact with a
nything related to the topic of the ""supernatural"" on TV, social media, conversation, music, etc will open them up to evil because maybe they're particularly sensitive or ""open"" to it. On top of it, they decide watching TV or listening to music with any type of sex or violence also aligns them with ""evil"" And maybe then, anything with profanities, etc.. Now they've constructed a set of beliefs and things they must avoid otherwise they'll turn ""evil"" or become possessed and end up committing the violent murder of their wife that they do not want to commit. Odd beliefs? I think by moral, part of what you mean what is seen as right and what is seen as wrong by others. I'm connecting this to a filter people must have in regards to social acceptability & anchoring themselves within societal norms. Along with that, it reminds me of that theory that psychotic symptoms can come from the brain not being able to filter out and categorize as much sensory stimuli as normative people can. ""Sensory gating"" or som
ething? I'd say this is the source of genius and creativity. Then again, I don't want to acknowledge it because I think it falls in line with the ""dopamine hypothesis theory"" for psychosis which then co-signs the digustingly mass overprescribing of antipsychotics all because our systems don't want to put any real effort, resources or investment into treating people. (I'm not saying some people don't legitimately need them. I'm just saying at this stage, it's more often just a cop-out for the medical profession. I'll stop my repetitive rant here). This also makes me wonder, when you speak of things that are denied by most or go unnoticed, would the reverse side of the coin be people who are paid to present information most effectively and on different levels of consciousness? Such as news presentation, advertising, politics, etc...? As in, if you were talking about an increase of aliens in the country, a psychiatrist is likely to think you're delusional and talking about beings from outer space whilst a norm
al person will assume you're talking about illegal immigrants? Or that a psychiatrist is more apt to understand metaphorical or abstract language than a normal person? Infuriating. Most people are brainless; half of what they accept is a mistake. Extremist feminisism forces this and they use it to hide the stereotypes they themselves project. Speaking of descriptiveness, I'm currently enjoying the exploration of taking nouns and adjectives and turning them into ""-ing"" form verbs in creative expression. Makes sense. For me, a flood of emotion and information stops me from being able to speak at all sometimes. Also ineffective. I guess it must also be connected to whether or not you're willing to put the effort into making something edible enough for the primate to consume and whether you're practiced at it. ^ Being only exposed to people not worth the effort, can leave it difficult to do on the rare occasion when you actually want to. This is interesting because if I isolate for too long I have can have quit
e a hard time adapting to the wavelengths of others and being verbally lucid for the first day or so - meaning I have to stay quiet, listen a lot and keep my sentences short. You may be thinking that I'm more perceptive than I actually am. I do, however, enjoy creativity and trying to understand complex and novel things. As I always say, best for humanity to be eradicated. Although, I'm uncertain of how comfortable I am in the idea that I'm asking a starving polar bear to come out of the water so I can ask it questions. Speaking of which, do polar bears normally eat primates or only fish and birds? Do they normally only eat what they catch? Or do they normally eat carrion as well? I'm wondering what meals are to you? Words? Interactions? Expressing ideas? Human connection? Or am I totally off the mark here? Thrill of the hunt? A source of nutritional value to stay alive and healthy, or...? Do you have a fixed set of vocabulary you like to stick to? Or is it adaptive and ever changing based on inspiration and 
situations? Anyone who's interacted with me knows I ask too many questions, so please feel free to ignore any or all of them."
175963158,"Got the laundry washing. Will need to wash my blankets and sheets later in the week. I'm a lot more active today than I have been in the past few days. For awhile I was just laying in bed everyday depressed. But I'm starting to feel like I have more energy. Connecting with my faith helps too. I see my friend tomorrow. Then I have an appointment with my therapist Thursday. Can't wait till my yoga set comes because it's gonna be an awesome day when it does. When it's delivered my sister will bring over that, my Legend planner, and some ice cream. I need to scrub my tub. I guess I'll do that Friday when I have nothing else going on. In the meantime I'll just try to stay on top of small household chores."
175963159,"My parents are going out of town for 5 days next week. Last time they went out of town, this is when I messed up, SH-_NAME_ too much and ended up IP. I'm trying to plan something for each day after work so I don't end up in a bad place. Kind of stressful though."
175963160,Read the book of _NAME_ from the Bible today in anticipation of The Bible Study that I ordered.
175963161,"I don't really know how to say this, but I feel like I was sexually assaulted as a child. I've never told anyone this before. When I was probably six or seven I was at my friends house (we'll call him _PERSON_). I remember _PERSON_ and I were in his driveway and an older boy was there. He asked us if we wanted to go see a corn field in the woods behind _PERSON_ house. We said yes and he led the way. I remember walking through the woods to get there, and then I remember getting there. But after that I don't remember anything. I don't remember walking back. I just remember we were there, and then we weren't. But the thing is, I asked _PERSON_ if he remembers the older boy being there and he swears that it was just us two and his little sister. I don't remember the boy's name, or how old he was. But I swear he was there. And why don't I remember what happened? This feels stupid because I don't remember anything bad happening, I just have a feeling that it did. Throughout my childhood I was very shy, a
nd I dressed like a boy for the longest time. In high school I was very anxious and depressed and self harmed a bit. I feel like I lose my temper easily and I don't know. I've looked at signs of childhood trauma and I relate to a good amount of those signs. I'm terrified to have sex. I'm not good at relationships. I've never had a real boyfriend. Is this just because I can't find anybody I like? Or did something happen to me that I repressed?"
175963162,"...oh and I forgot to mention congrats on the improvement you have facilitated for yourself, prior to this detour. This is a temporary challenging time, and with the reaching out you are doing and seeking to find new tools to help yourself...you'll be back to that good place (and beyond!) again soon. _PERSON_"
175963163,yes I did
175963164,"Yeah. I'm not too keen on the other colors. I really only like the pokemon one and the yellow one. I wish they had Game Boy Color colorways. Like, the teal, kiwi lime, translucent purple, etc.. The teal on the new switch lite isn't the same shade. I want nostalgic colors."
174352349,"Interesting you mentioned the math bit. I was just thinking about something related to this very thing. I have always conceptualized my mind as if it were made of mathematical equations, and I love math. I was wondering off-handedly a bit ago, what if my schizophrenia is one huge set of mathematical equations? Theoretically, I could figure out what those equations are and well, solve them. I also believe there is one huge equation that links the rest together. The Schizophrenia Equation, as it were. If I find that one and figure out how to solve it, I win."
175963165,"Dear mc1986 I read every word you wrote, and I read it with my heart. And my understanding. Other than not having been in the military I have experienced all that you mention. I’ve made up many creative but sad excuses to get out of being with people, even people I like and love. And then you have a mix of relief from getting out of it but shame and sadness that this is what you have to do. I have no wisdom or helpful tips. It sounds like you are doing what you can, trying the meds etc. but I know how it can feel, losing hope when they don’t have the effect you crave. So all I have to offer you is that I get it and it is a hard road for us. _PERSON_"
175963166,I hope he's OK.
175963167,"I feel great. Already have tons of energy since my chlorpromazine was decreased , I actually feel alive and can walk long distances without pouring sweat now."
175963168,"I have been in the same type situations, except add in an emotionally absent husband. I am a Christian, however I have been kind of wishy washy about my relationship with God. I too am a codependent person so without a lot of emotional support I feel alone in a dark place. I had a epiphany this evening. I am not alone! God has put me here, seemingly alone, so I can see and feel Him, without all the noise of others. I don’t know what your beliefs are but the Bible says God has “planted eternity in the human heart” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). That means nothing and no one can fill that “God shaped hole” except God. The Bible also tells us in 2 Corinthians 9:10-13 God is the giver of everything and Proverbs 3:9-10 if you give God your best He will bless you abundantly! I urge you to talk to God, look up harvest.org, _NAME_ is a great minister. I grew up in a pastor’s home and have always gone to church, but through brother _NAME_’s ministry I have made a real connection with God. This world is 
not our home, these issues you and I are facing are temporary. The bigger picture is where will our eternal home be? I pray this helps, I am praying for you and the beauty God can bring out of your misery, sorrow and loneliness. May God bless you. PS. Look up I am not alone by _NAME_ jobe and blessings by _NAME_ story"
175963169,I don't know if I do have an inner monologue. I know that from the moment I wake up in the morning to going to sleep at night I have songs constantly playing in my head. I also know that I have a paranoid little imp inside my head who's suspicious of absolutely everyone around me and tells me not to trust anyone. I try and tell him to stop but he just likes to play. There are others in there as well but none of them really monologue as in drone on and on and on and on and on and on. If they did I'd just tell them to shut the ###$ up.
175963170,"Not doing too well. Just down because of things with grad school. I guess I feel regretful about it. I shouldn't, but that's the way I am. I am hoping I can do one of these intensive outpatient programs starting Monday. I just need something else, I think. In addition to outpatient therapy and psychiatry. I need to do something differently. Also I wish therapists were available on weekends. Seemingly I struggle most on weekends... I was seriously considering going to the hospital last night. I know I'm pretty vague about how I feel but I was feeling really bad."
175963171,"Don’t let the depression slide too far without taking action. Do some self care..ideally pick three fun things and do them together. You might need to do some online shopping to get something new and fun, whatever appeals to you, new music, coffee/tea a show you might like, doesn’t matter but make sure you appeal to at least three senses at once."
175963172,That’s weird. Some people seem to think they are including me. Not sure where they heard it from but I’ve been told they are giving out monthly checks.
175963173,"Hi _NAME_ and welcome back, Although I am sorry it is due to the very rough time you are going through now. I am saddened to hear that you are having such difficulty with anxiety and the eating and sleeping issues that go along with it. So a couple of things here. One you are coming up on the anniversary...and while you have had some time to mourn B...it is still brand new in many ways...and these significant firsts are always really hard. That is of course going to trigger you. However, I would dare to say (and forgive me if I've overstepped) that the fact that you are the kids are having conflict is even more affecting you. You love those kids and have always felt a sense of being their parent...and after B's passing...felt even more responsibility for them. I can't imagine what it must be doing to you to not be talking with them. I am not sure what happened...but I hope that they can see how wrong it is for you not to be pulling together at this time. I pray for resolution! For now, work your co
ping skills, go to your appointments and do your best to get through this period. It will not always be this hard. You will come out the other side of this given time and continued efforts. Keep posting with us so we can keep you wrapped up in support. okay? _PERSON_"
175963174,I'm eating a lunch meat sandwich for lunch and an apple. Kind of boring but it will get the job done.
174352371,Funny thing. I met someone at a hospital visit. He started talking to me. He seemed alright. After hospital stay I gave him my number luckily not my address but actually had him on Facebook. A few months later I found out he killed someone phew.
175963175,It’s ok it just hurt my throat.....
175963176,"Thanks _PERSON_ , Yes I've been having them a lot lately, and really bad ones. I went a year or more without them so I'm not sure why. I talked to my T about them a bit, I'll probably bring it up to my doctor next time I see her"
175963177,No one should be complaining about you when you’re having med changes. Don’t blame yourself. If they’re not understanding it’s on them for being inconsiderate.
175963178,"Okay I got the vacuuming done, just need to clean the bathroom and take the trash out now"
175963179,"It’s very hard to find people that understand. I feel that too. I vent to a couple of people, but they don’t get it. I do the same thing.. I disconnect. Don’t see anyone. But being on here has helped me tremendously. I’m also a horrible sleeper. I have been for 15 years. I just switched my sleep med.. have you tried one?? It has really helped me. Hang in there.. I’m here if you need to talk! ??"
174352380,"I did not think anyone cared that I was gone or that if they did, they were glad to be relieved of my presence. I would not have blamed anyone, I scare the hell out of myself ... lol ... I have lost pretty much everyone in my life that was in my life before 2013 and has made the mistake of trying to get close to me since then. My schizophrenia is evil. I do not know how else to describe it considering the sheer level and scale of catastrophic destruction it has left and will continue to leave in its wake. I was convinced I was the devil as opposed to the victim of the devil at least twice that I recall. Once earlier this year, and in 2018. Both around the same times of the year now that I think about it, late winter through most of spring. I have a semi ironic theory that grandiose delusions are why I never fell into any kind of substance abuse."
175963180,It’s a great community of people w similar experiences and it lets you know that you’re not alone. Many times you can even make friends around the world who will check in on you and provide support. I hope you’ll feel comfortable sharing what’s on your mind.
175963181,Our neighbors sold their townhouse condo right next door to us. I hope the new people aren’t loud party people. I hope they’re studious book worms who listen to music with headphones.
175963182,I think I got about 8 hours of sleep.
175963183,"I’m glad you two are seeking counseling. My two cents worth, your son needs to get a life. He needs to leave home. No wonder there is friction. Your husband works hard to provide and you work hard to maintain the home and the son is still there and he’s 30? You and your husband need to set healthy boundaries with him!! Ive talked to New Life Ministries and they helped me find a counselor. I listen to their broadcast daily. You can Google them to listen. I hear lots of parents in your predicament with adult kids at home. It causes lots of friction!! Enjoy your days with your husband. Rediscover each other! It can be wonderful!"
175963184,"I used to never say good morning and when people asked how I was, I'd say ""Good"" even though I was depressed af and wouldn't ask someone how they are back."
175963185,"Saw the pdoc, got my blood drawn, he said I should get used to the sleepiness with time."
175963186,Time 2 sleep. Gonna take a full zopiclone tonight to get rid of residual stimulation from d-amph adrenaline metabolites. The phenibut will put me in a deep sleep like last night - I had a dream that lasted hours it seemed.. I'll take 1g before I go skiing tomorrow - It will be awesome! I'm going up to the mountain at noon. Reality seems to be getting weirder for me every day. I don't feel as good as I did last night - Just ok. But I'm very aware in my perception of things.. I basically live inside of my imagination. The big change in my life is coming within the next few days-weeks. That's what I believe. I also believe that everyone else in my life will also have something positive happen. Night!
175963187,My pdoc has officially changed my dx from bp 1 (w/ psychotic features) to schizoaffective bp type. My psyd says i more than likely have SZA but he hasnt officially changed it in my file. No big deal to me except I dont really understand my illness either way. I have been under stress bc of school but I am not depressed or manic. I am right in the middle where I should be. (yay!) BUT..I am having stuff happen. I keep feeling bugs crawling on me. It happens a lot when im in a mood episode but not very often when I am dong ok. Sooooo...why is this happening?? My mind isnt muddled feeling (How i describe it when I am bad off). SO..anyone have an idea why I am having these sensations? My psyd seems concerned.
175963188,"- Why can’t I connect emotionally to my partner? - What is this wall between me and other people? - What is it that makes me feel smothered in relationships? - Why don’t I feel lonely/miss my partner when she’s gone? - How can I explain this non-negotiable need for excessive alone time? ^The above are all broad term questions and not specific to you. I don't doubt that there has been anyone who cannot relate to it. Everyone feels the need to have their own space and relationships can be smothering. Successful relationships come with a compromise. Thinking that these thoughts are different from anyone else's thinking is most likely going to be the real problem here. If you believe your thinking is that of an outsider you will most likely feel that way or act like one as this would probably cause intense social anxiety. The worse this gets, the worse these thoughts will get and a vicious cycle will continue. So, first things first: Normalize your thinking. It's not unusual. Secondly communicate 
with those you are in a relationship with. My partner and I each have individual rooms in our place. It works out although I generally sleep in his bed. At least I have the freedom of my own space when I need it and it's not an unusual want."

I'm just afraid of going so mad that I end up in the hospital. But things can be good.. Take a drug... Chase the high.. Feel the pain.. And then do something about it. I don't know what to do and I don't care. But it's in our biology to care... about something.. I need to get out and do something.. OH well so does everyone else right? Does that justify it? Of course! Because there's a virus! So I can do anything I want but I want to do multiple things. I guess I have to focus on one thing and suffer, ignoring, everything I want to do...

175963194,"O.K. witisu, I have hope because I know The Lord Jesus Christ, who has promised to never leave us or forsake us, and His mercies are given to us new each morning. He came to earth to give us a better life, a life filled with His love, and His guidance, and most of all...a hope for eternal life. Those are things which you can have also, just by asking Him to come into your heart and to be your guide. Yes, the world is an absolute mess right now, politically and health wise, but when one is loved and guided by The Lord Jesus Christ, we find we do not have to fear, because we are loved and held securely by He who made the world in the first place. You too can have all of that witisu....it is available to all who ask."

175963201,"Welcome to my life! I can’t even come close to telling you crippling, terrifying, overwhelming bouts of anxiety, depression, and manic episodes I’ve had in the last 14 years. I am too struggling day to day, minute to minute with the fear of dying. I agree with _NAME_, I’m not afraid of actual death. It’s the PROCESS of dying. Heart attacks and strokes are my main fears. The fact that you KNOW you’re dying or think you’re dying is the issue with me. Like what happens when you’re seconds from death? Does it hurt? Are you aware that you’re dying ? What’s after death? These are all obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Some may call them irrational, I call them human curiosity. Some may think these thoughts once or twice in their lifetime and never really bother with them again. And then there’s us, we all have our own “type and triggers” of anxiety. I find my anxiety to be a blessing and a curse. It helps me to stay on the right track in life. But it’s also very overwhelming"

175963207,"I agree with _PERSON_. Prayers for you, SadMom04. I went thru a major depression this summer. I had talked with a counselor a few times on the phone. I went to a local clinic and asked for an antidepressant. I listened to upbeat Christian music on the radio. I wrote lists and checked them off. Even little accomplishments helped. The big overwhelming things I put off to deal with later when I was stronger. I shared my sadness with a few friends who talked with me and prayed for me. Maybe you could find a local church to attend. Hang in there. You’re not alone."

175963224,"I have an inner MP3 player. Various forms of inner mono/dialogues are sometimes there, sometimes not, but what stays consistent is that, when I'm not particularly thinking of something or focusing on something (even if I may be trying to), there's a song playing on repeat in my head. If it happens to be a song that I don't remember well, then it's maddening. Not hard to change the track though, so that much isn't particularly problematic. It's pretty common that I hear or even just think of a word (sometimes a pretty common and mundane one) and then hours later I notice that there's a song playing in my head where the chorus starts with that word, or something like that. The same happens with any type of sound. It doesn't have to be a sequence of notes, it can be a single tone. Like if there's a song that has waterdrop sounds, and I hear just one drop of water falling and it sounds specifically similar enough to me, it can easily be enough to bring that song to the forefront. It can be songs I have
n't heard or listened to in years, not uncommon. This still applies even right as I'm waking up. It's usually a song I've been listening to, but sometimes it's a totally surprising one to me. It's usually a song with some kind of ""anxious energy"", for lack of a better description. Right now it's this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTO3tja7uaQ This is one of the things that make it very clear to me that I really do have ADHD with a proper H. It definitely both affects and is affected by my mood, and shapes to a significant degree my sense of where I am in space and (especially) time."

So unless you just happen to have some reaction to part of what makes up the 'filler' component of the non brand pill (highly unlikely) you will not note a difference, as the actual medication base is the same.

I remember some problems with bullying of some participants. We had people in chat that never posted in the forum for that very reason...they knew it wasn't often watched, and they could get away with saying things there that they would never be able to here. So when the new format was established, the chat rooms did not make the transition. I am sorry that part of your favorite aspect of HW is no longer.

175963278,"I haven’t posted here in a while and I’m planning a few update journal entries but I need to collect my thoughts after the shift I had. First off I want to say that I LOVE my new job. It’s entry level but the pay is competitive and even better it’s in the medical lab field, which is exactly my wheelhouse. But today at work I was listening to my usual podcasts and I just was not retaining anything I was listening to and I didn’t want to “waste my time” listening to podcasts just to have to relisten at another date because I don’t have much patience for repetition, generally. So instead I switched to music. First I tried listening to new foreign language music with the thought that a) if I can’t understand most of the lyrics and don’t know the translation by heart already then they can’t trigger me and b) by listening to new music I was trying to reintroduce myself to pop culture that I love that I’ve withdrawn from for far too long. Didn’t work. Instead, rather than focus o
n the beats and try to see if I like a new song or not I was just flooded with intrusive thoughts. They weren’t negative thoughts so much as just... it felt like I was finally allowing myself to think about all the feelings and issues I’ve been setting to the side in favor of just surviving and getting through the day, week, month, life. In fact, some of my thoughts were tinged positive and that seemed to make me even sadder. Somehow the positive thoughts and the comforts I desperately want to hear are just making me ball uncontrollably. Just in writing that last sentence an example pops into my head and I’m sobbing now. Example: I’ve been doing so well recently and been on such an up swing all year, despite the absolute garbage fire that is the state of the world in 2020; and now I’ve had a few setbacks recently and I’m falling apart and it hurts so bad but I’m AWARE and I’m RECOGNIZING IT and I’m currently feeling a little manic-like energy, hopefully in a good way, and I’m taking action
s and making plans and trying to get out of it. And that’s progress. And that is currently making me hyperventilate-cry. I feel like I’m finally getting a handle on how to manage my depression and how to recognize when I need to get help and knowing and ACTING on the things it’s in my power to change. And somehow that progress makes me sad? I tried switching between some other new music playlists on Spotify but apparently all the new pop music is either too relatable and painful or too empowering and THAT was also making me cry harder than the pain. Finally, I relented and went back to my phones’ library of downloaded, personally curated playlists and listened to some upbeat music I know I love, and while some songs still stung, overall I was able to calm down and finish my shift without anyone approaching me to ask me if I was ok, because that would just be mortifyingly embarrassing. Thank god for masks! Maybe I should have stopped and gone home, or at least stopped and composed myself away from my d
esk. But I didn’t and I got through it. Instead I stayed at my desk. And I fought to feel my feelings. That’s right. I felt my feelings. Eventually, I just relented and allowed myself to explore all the things that were making me sad and all the options I had for fixing the small issues and setting goals to lift my spirits and remembered all the hobbies I loved and want to start practicing. So yeah I just had a very emotional shift of work where I sat at my desk entering data like a drone on autopilot while in my head and body I was feeling all the feelings and feeling empowered and inspired, all the while crying as silently as I could and simultaneously hoping that I did and did not get caught having a breakdown by my coworkers. I left work quickly after I was all done and then immediately parked in a neighboring parking lot to send my brother a message thanking him for his Xmas gift to me. After all that I just really felt the need to practice some gratitude in the hopes of lifting someone else up. Beca
use I just did not feel good and I wanted to make someone I love dearly feel better than I feel right now."

Ativan isn't the answer and there is real risk of addiction here. imperative you keep trying. took me almost 4 months to find a ssri that worked but I kept at it . I was also in terriable shape as you are now. celexa worked and I have my life back. were you on the starting dose of 10mg? some times you have to start on a weaker dose than whats normally recommend and gradually work up from there. don't be afraid to try this. . wish we could tell you straight away which med will be the magic one but sadly we cant. every one reacts differently to these kind of meds. best of luck and I was exactly where you are now on

nch of ""thought distortions"". I get that everyone is trying to help. I don't blame anyone. But, here I am, feeling completely trapped, and I don't know what to do. I was seeing a therapist. I told her upfront that I needed someone to accept my experience as ""Reality"". I guess she thought that she could change my mind. Finally, she told me that we couldn't talk about my experiences anymore. So, I had to quit. I'm not a fragile person. I wasn't overly attached to her. I'll find another therapist. But its so frustrating. This is exactly how my family handled the situation. We just couldn't talk about it. And my sister said she needed boundaries. But my experience is a huge part of my life. So what do I talk about with them? Does anyone have any recommendations for finding a therapist that is experienced with people diagnosed with delusions? How about therapists who specialize in people feeling ""gaslit"" by the mental health profession, as well as friends and family. Is it frustrating to anyone else that no 
one trusts our opinions and experiences? Do you feel belittled and judged? Any suggestions? I've thought about this for a long time, and I don't see a way to get around this feeling. It's become another ""fact"" in my experience. Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you!"

175963356,"I’m a 77yo guy, 10 years retired from IT, conventional work and family history, divorced for 19 years after 22 year marriage, miscellaneous relationships since divorce but have given up looking for an intimate relationship as I’ve finally accepted that I can’t honestly offer a potential partner any hope of a heart connection. I started a writing course this year. One of the assignments allowed me to write a Personal Essay, a recognised genre in nonfiction writing. I chose the topic of “Indifference” and set an essay scope of: my adult lifelong indifference/apathy, society’s attitude to individual and group indifference, scientific and medical takes on indifference and two fictional portrayals of characters exhibiting strong indifference. While researching the medical-scientific conditions that have indifference as a symptom, I re-visited Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD), a diagnosis which I, and a couple of therapists, had previously considered. We rejected the diagnosis because I ha
ve been, for all my adult life, socially available, interested, and engaged. I have behaved as an outwardly “normal” husband, father, grandfather, lover and friend. And then I came across the sub-category of “secret schizoid”, a schizoid who functions “normally” by complying with expectations and playing a part in which their personality is not involved. Though I’ve yet to get this self-diagnosis confirmed professionally, it feels right. I feel enlightened, knowable and validated. Though it’s satisfying and a relief to acquire a “label”, to receive a diagnosis, it unavoidably raises the question “What now?”. I think I have three options: 1. Business as usual 2. “Come out” 3. Try and change Option 1: Business as usual. I know I am an impostor. I behave socially as though I have normal feelings. Nobody (except my ex-wife) has ever challenged the falseness of my behaviour given my underlying lack of feelings. There may be other people – I can’t have fooled them all – who know ab
out my underlying indifference but accept my company nonetheless. Some people, probably most, don’t know about my indifference and are misled by my behaviour. Those people see me doing normal social things and assume it’s because I have normal social needs. I don’t. I do those things for other reasons: intellectual stimulation, fun, altruism, sexual desire, conflict avoidance. Funnily enough, I’m not unhappy day-to-day with how my life is going, particularly now that I have acknowledged my indifference. At least, I feel no pain or distress that needs immediate attention. I have a nagging feeling that I’ve never been part of the human race, having never known what loving and being loved feel like. And, as I approach the end of my life, I wonder how I’ll deal with a negative evaluation of my life as I look back from my deathbed. Option 2: “Come out” Come out as the unfeeling, unempathetic person that I am, decide what that means for relationships with family and friends and act on those decision
s (scary for me – possible conflict, potentially hurtful for family and friends). But least, I’d then be living honestly, authentically, no longer an impostor. Option 3: Try and change Try and change to become a feeling person. I think that will need psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) or something equally brain-altering. Other therapies haven’t shifted me. Getting some of the beneficial mind-bending results claimed by PAT proponents would represent the best of all outcomes available to me. If I get nowhere with PAT, I’m no worse off. There will be no bad outcomes – I will be trusting my guides to get me through any bad trip. This forum is the first context in which I’ve disclosed my new insights. I would be glad of any responses from fellow schizoids, particularly “secret ones”. Previous to registering for the forum, I searched for and found some posts mentioning “secret schizoid” but since I registered and logged in, the search facility seems to have disappeared – I’ll keep looking! I
’m looking for comments on my self-diagnosis and suggestions for therapeutic techniques that have worked for others. Thanks in advance for any interest."

175963362,"Hi. I have not been officially diagnosed with anhedonia yet, in fact until yesterday I had never heard of it. I stumbled upon the word reading these boards when i saw a message that read like i had written it. A member commented and said it sounded like anhedonia so I researched it and could put money on the chances i have been dealing with this for years. I am 49 and I would say probably since my 20's I have had this in some level of severity. I am posting here because I really need the input of others and opinions. I am not opposed to seeking talk therapy, but I do like to know what I am seeking therapy for due to my past experiences with therapists. But I do have a very good relationship with my pdoc so if it is something medication can help there is no problem. First of all, I read the definition of anhedonia and it stated it is the inability to feel pleasure. I take it a step farther, I really dont feel any emotion. By reading posts here I see that is not unusual so i think so far i am in the 
right place. The whole thing is I dont feel bad. I am not sad. I have been blah in the past for years but that lifted about 6 months ago and i feel ok. I just cant do anything. I feel internally paralyzed. (i do suffer from anxiety and have wondered if it is my anxiety disorder doing this..but i think they are all linked) I can smile and laugh at tv shows but i feel like I fit the criteria for depression because there is no joy. Even when I see my grandbabies, the lights of my life I dont feel like I am emotionally at the level of normal. I dont get mad, I have no passion for anything in life, no motivation all the while I crave change. I am logical now with emotional things it feels phony. I am a genuine person i dont like to be fake but I cannot get excited when i supposed to or cry when i am supposed to, even if i want to cry. What I find quite upsetting, and again correct me if this is not a symptom, but I cant feel touch like I used to. From hand holding, massage to lovemaking it is like my body is hollo
w if that makes sense. This has really become a problem in the last six years since i am unable to orgasm now. This creates a whole new set of problems for me and my husband because my sex drive has died. Another thing I noticed about the reward center of my brain is now when i smoke pot i dont get high, maybe 2 percent of the time if it is extremely potent weed...If I drink i dont feel drunk, no more getting tipsy. I get the physical affects of alcohol when i have too much beer, my speech will slur, i might tip over slightly but i feel no high and on two occasions i took shroomshad no trip. I know that the progression of my disease, duration and number of episodes and treatments I have received all have affected me and my brain, but I do believe I have anhedonia, I could really use your opinion and ideas to cope. thanks kt"

175963367,"In bed with my vape. It's producing more vapor than before for some reason. I shouldn't use it up because my state might be the next to have a vaping ban. I don't know if they'll let me keep using my big vape after that. If it's just a flavor ban that's not too serious really (actually, it almost is). But if they ban the whole thing I really don't know. If I were at home I'd just continue to use my supplies as usual, until they ran out. If I were at home I could buy diy supplies and be stocked for years. I'm bored and depressed. I want to hear the sound on Star Trek Voyager, I want to leave my room between 11:30 and 12pm. But it's a very oppressive atmosphere here. I'm afraid to do anything to make life harder for the bed ridden resident in here.

I like my apartment a lot, just can't deal with the stairs."
175963368,"Yeah, I get _NAME_ sometimes, it's normal. As for feeling like your life is on loop I guess that could be caused by having days that are somewhat repetitive?

I'm having health issues, physical health issues, that are just worsening because of my weight and I really need help with my weight but more than just eating bad and the medicine I'm on. I think it's a psychological thing. Like I use food for comfort. My body is in bad shape due to that, but idk how to address it. I don't address it either because I'm so concerned about my anxieties in life. My anxiety controls me."
174352652,Saw my doctor. He says he’s slightly concerned about my psychotic stuff from the last few days but in the grand scheme of things it’s three days of odd thinking. Which I get.

175963387,Done. So done.
175963388,"Maybe. It seems like a mostly descriptive list of features anyway. I don't know where it came from, but my guess is that it was invented by someone who had a theory about statistical links and causation and stuff, and wanted a separate category that would suit their surveys / research. If you mean that as an extension of your agreeing with me, then I think you missed my point. Everyone , without exception, will cling to (or at least passively stick to) some type of nonsense or other until $#%^ hits the fan. The difference between different people will be a matter of degree and circumstance, not a matter of ""some do it, others don't"". Belief is the necessary scaffolding for sane thought. Now here I bring back the word I just used: scaffolding. It's belief as a foundation that's dangerous and harmful. Religion per se is fine (as long as it leaves me alone). Dogmatism is not (and it doesn't even matter if it's religious or not). I don't see a difference between militant atheism and militant religion
. Or militant politics, for that matter. Potayto, potahto. I suppose you're implying that those people are dumb because of that? I don't get it. I mean, I like my recliner better than the floor, because it's more comfortable. ""Of course it is. It's a recliner."" I can't speak for anyone else, but I fear death, and those aren't the things (or the types of things) that I fear about it. I just fear... death. Death is bad. It's to be avoided. I want to keep existing. That's about it. Oh I've heard of that one. How is it different from a creator god though? It doesn't change anything other than narrative flavor. It's just a more ""sci-fi"" way to anthropomorphize the unknowable. It's no different from old-fashioned mythologies (monotheistic ones included). Religion isn't about belief though, it's all about social cohesion. If it's not, then it's not religion. Not necessarily. Again, the actual problem is dogmatism (or fundamentalism), not religion itself. I was raised under a specifically Catholic mindset, but I 
was always taught that no religion was fundamentally wrong just for being a different religion. My parents can be passive-aggressive about a lot of things, but I can tell that they actually don't mind and don't care that I don't have a religion and that I openly dislike and dismiss the very idea of religion. It's ""my thing"", and religion is theirs. This used to be the dominant attitude and mindset around here until very recently. It baffles me to no end how it changed so quickly and so drastically. Wait, what about Hindus? If they don't count as ""pagans"" from a Muslim point of view, then who does? Some people believe in their religion. Most are probably just members of it, and proclaiming and (at least publicly) adhering to a certain set of beliefs is just a formal requirement for membership. It's that membership that they care about. And on the other side of things, the pope doesn't care if you sin. He does care if you sin and then insist publicly that you were right in doing so. Because then you're brea
king or challenging the intended social cohesion. Fundamentalists though... They're beyond my understanding. Dismissing them as ""dumb"" and ""weak"" is clearly a mistake though."
175963389,"I wish I could go back to the hypomania I was having for the past few days. At least it didn't progress to full blown mania this time. But it still kind of crashed. I felt so confident in everything about life. Now I'm unsure, since the buzz of the hypomania has worn off. Anyway. I'm getting my nails done on the 6th. I don't typically get my nails done professionally, as in the last time I did it was like 5 years ago. But my sister wants me to go with her so I'm gonna do that and we're gonna have lunch together afterward at home. So that should be interesting. Maybe I could get some kind of spring colors/designs. I have this phone call I have to make Friday which I'm really nervous about. I can't wait till that's done and over with. Can't keep putting it off.

175963421,Welcome
175274926,"Hi everyone, I'm lost regarding what i'm feeling. I'm not sure if these are anxiety symptoms that i'm feeling. (sorry this post may be long). For about 2 months, ive been having lung, chest, rib, back shoulder, shoulder blade pain. It goes from one side to the other. When COVID came, for a few days i'd have panic attacks - nausea, loss of apetite, shaking, acid reflux, etc. But those are done. The pain doesnt go away. Literally from the second i wake up it starts. even when im consumed in work. Like right now, it's on my right side. There's pain when i inhale in my back, in my shoulder, under my armpit and it's radiating in my right arm all the way down to my fingertips. There's also lung pain i feel when i inhale. The same happens on the left side. When i swallow water, or even spit i'll feel pain on the sides below my armpit all the way down. 3 days ago I had heart pain and severe pain on the left side.It radiated to the left arm and between my shoulder blades. It was more intense than usual. I g
ot so scared, i went to the ER. They did EKG, xray, and they were both normal. I've taken GERD medicine (Mylanta) for a few days thinking it's gas related. it didnt do much. I live in NYC. literally in the epicenter of this virus. The pain is too real too intense to be anxiety. Yes i used to be really anxious a few weeks ago. But i'm doing better. If it was anxiety, these pains should have decreased. I'll get difficulty breathing but i'll check my pulse and oxygen saturation levels and both are normal. Even when im not thinking about this virus, i'll get these symptoms. And they've lasted all day everyday since March. I've made an appointment with a cardiologist and he should do tests. What doctor do I visit? Also, yes, im asthmatic but this isnt asthma related. :("
175963422,"I want to visit where you live. My dad used to work there and he'd bring me back these really cool tribal things like carvings, a dart blower, knives.. Cool things you can buy at markets I bet.. And something about the jungle I just love.. Rain forests.. The humidity and heat.., The food (Even though my Se sucks and I don't talk about food or drinks.. Just sugar..), and everyone has average IQ of like 110! Cuz they must trip on some exotic psychedelic herb.. (And Yaba tbh...)"
175963423,"Mtinside: Nope You Can NOT give up! I say from honesty, no IT's just not an option, ""because"" you haven't discovered what is on the other side of this problematic dark wall yet you keep hitting! You see, you Do have the ability to survive this! It will take a few adjustment, reset your thinking & hopes towards thinking forward. I'll explain further... Hitting Bottom Is one of the most difficult experiences anyone could ever experience! Not many understand what it is like to struggle, trying to keep ones head above water ...when it truly ""feels"" as though as if every circumstance keep knocking backwards, or as if you've tapped out every possible resource you thought possible. I compare it to much like struggling to keep ones head above water because it seems it takes every bit of energy to try to stay a float, but still treading water and it gets exhausting. Then just as you think things calm down for a moment, then is seems as if you keep getting yanked back under, just as you manage to gasping 
for a breath of fresh air. This air representing catching a break to just get through the next moment or day? Also hope or help a person pursues reaching out for proactive help through proper channels, medical professionals, etc. Especially more difficult when it might seem they are not taking you seriously, are forgetful or just not as proactive as you'd hope they'd be. *Depression, PTSD, anxiety, loss, are difficult and can become crippling. It may be easy for people to give advice, medical opinion, or guidance, but what they are not aware of is that people in these stages are asking for someone to step in and literally help navigate one through these situations because when a person is drained, crippled, shutdown, they are weakened, it takes maybe just one unselfish, kinda and truly concerned person to reach in and ask, ""How can I help you through this moment?"" Secondary to this they need to sincerely follow through! When experiencing these roughest of times, a person reaches out for help, guidance, and 
sincerely want to make healthy choices, get back on a path towards better days aead an thrive verses being stuck in the victim/survival mode which is so very exhausting. Trying to pull yourself up to the next level, to a safer zone, but frustrated because it can feel much like a person isn't able to get their footing, only to stumble, scrape our knees & elbows trying. Or as if grabbing at the air becasue a consistent helpful hand is not available. When a person is unable to swim and begin to drown. they kick, struggle, pull at anything and anyone around them hoping to help feed their survival. Consumed by the weight of the stressors, we fear we will have so much more difficulty, that we'll end up sinking deep under the surface. Hoping someone will at least throw a rope or some sort of life saving raft to help keep us a float. The key point to these analogies is your lives shouldn't have to be where we end up stuck in victim/survival modes. No one wants to be in such a dark and bewildering places during their 
lives. In fact there is a constant resonating instinct to struggle becasue....""Deep down inside, you know the there IS a reason why ""You Are Still Here On Earth"" regardless of how difficult the battle may be. There IS a reason you are Existing, fighting for your own life! The thought you hold onto is You want to know the positive outcome after difficult struggles. You forward your thinking towards the near future, keep asking & keep pursuing for ...""What IS' on the other side of this wall?"" and this will help your mind and brain t pursue further. I share with you something helpful. Something that helped not only myself but many others out here in Inspire.com & beyond! No more keeping past sad or negative happenings or event as if there are on a calendar or count-down clock. There is nothing to gain from keeping up with these events. Reflection is helpful in minimal lengths of time, but should be mostly because ""you WANT To Move Beyond life experiences. Not keep them anchored to to drag around with us, l
ike a cannon-ball & chains. They are not that which makes us WHO we are. It will be helpful to No longer keep count the past time frames regarding when terrible events occurred. Instead opt to ""release them"" to leave them in the past were they belong so they do not continue to reign power over your life. There ""is"" wisdom is the words people have shared with you, when they say phrases such as ...""you have the strength to get through this too;"" (Even though every fiber of your being, is screamming that ""But It's soooooo difficult to fight these battles!"" *There is one awesome simple resource that you can request & receive help from. *It doesn't coast any $. *No appointment required, and you will end up being first in line of as a priority. If you sincerely desire a consistent assistance from this point further, all you have to do is reach out, call on this resource, submit your request, ""with"" hopefulness; then patiently listen; then patiently wait for direction. Then you will experience resolution. 
People and situations and opportunities will rise in your life and you will notice you'll begin to reaching the level to thrive, beyond any past expectations. I discovered exactly this when I reached out to this resource too. Hope you will choose to reach out to the same. *This resource is Jesus Christ. The One and Only God, That promised each and everyone of us who believes, that we will never left alone or forsaken (forgotten). If I had not reach out to the resource, I would not be here today, becasue when all others left, passed away, became too busy to remember I once existed, broke their promises, or failed me or my hopeful expectations in every possible way... Peace will pour over you, anxieties will calm. you will be restored, You will see how everything you ever experienced help to prepare you for something much grander on the other side of that brick wall you seem to keep crashing into. *If you have any further questions or need further guidance, please reach out to me via personal message or here wi

175963424,Oh fack I'm so unfocused and spaced out. 30mg of Vyvanse for a week won't be enough - I might just sleep and rest/dream for a week. Ignore me if I complain - But complaining is better than not taking it as prescribed....
175963425,"Maybe I shouldn't be upset. He had to work all day. I'm just really stressed out. The dog is chewing up shyt in between me packing things and doesnt listen. It stress me the **** out.

175963426,I’m sorry to hear _PERSON_ from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175963427,"Hey _PERSON_, Sorry things have been challenging for you lately. If you feel that going on your trip would just be too much and tip the scale in anxiety's favor...then perhaps rescheduling would be a good idea. However, if you can use your coping skills to get you through it...it could be beneficial to push yourself a bit, and have a fun distracting time with your friend. Only you know where that line is for you, so do your best to evaluate where you are at the moment and make the right choice for yourself. Peace and progress, S.C."
175963428,I hope the pdoc will be able to change your meds around and help as much as they can.
175963429,Huge brain fog this morning
175963430,"Yes, I am compliant, whatever that means . . . I took my meds."

175963432,Are you drinking water etc?
175963433,"I’m starting to hate cooking. _PERSON_ expects food every night. It’s taking a lot out of me a bit. But he won’t cook. I mean I don’t ask, but he came up and asked if I wanted food. He was gonna cook. Then said the dishes were dirty. I opted to order pizza. He said no he wants food to be made. But he wants to play video games and for me to cook."
175963434,"Thanks for checking in about it. Yeah, I'm feeling better about it and my decision-making in general. I still feel some anxiety about work though. I don't know -- this is work work, not school work. And still having trouble getting motivated for things in general, but mostly school work. I basically have no schedule or routine."
175963435,"I've been diagonized with bipolar disorder in 2011. From then on I started to take meds that helps me recover and get back up to my normal functioning. But I stopped taking the med as a result of me thinking, I no longer need them since I felt normal(this was b/c of the lack of awareness), which triggered withdrawl symptoms. Now I'm on meds again and felt a lot better. But I'm really struggling to cover my medical bills."
175963436,"Wow, nobody around. Weird. Slept horribly. Total joke. Maybe a nap later. _PERSON_. I never worry about sleep anymore, I can't control it, so... Got a lot done on the book yesterday. It is sorta really starting to come together. I can sorta see it all happening now, which is always a relief. You create this thing from nothing and it is always a bit of an adventure to bring it together. Then, it becomes a living, breathing entity. So cool. One of my meds makes my nose and eyes itch like mad, kinda like bad allergies. Annoying. Need to clean the bathroom today. Maybe I will have energy to do that. Kitchen looks fairly decent, though, so, that is nice. I have a super hard time with activities of daily living. Has anyone here ever hired someone to help with these things that are hard for them to get done? I could sure benefit from a case manager or something like that. I cannot really afford it, though. Someone to come check on me every so often and stuff. Be sure I am taking my meds and the place is n
ot too messy and I am not like, totally psychotic and curled up, hiding from spies and stuff. Trying to get myself a kitty cat, so I can have a little friend here with me. That would be nice and they are lower maintenance than a doggie."
175963437,"That's an option , or if any of the above hire a specialist."
175963438,"R., Interpersonal conflicts are a huge anxiety trigger for me, so this likely could be a situational challenge that will pass as you find resolution with your spouse. Practice your coping skills and see how you feel once things are more peaceful in your world. Wishing you the best with feeling better and working things out. S.C."
175963439,Can your fiancé go with you? That may make it a little easier/more comfortable

I am wearing my glasses today because my eyes were tired. I am happy. I turned on the air conditioner and now it is cool inside. It appears as if I might have to go to the centers in July. I don't mind. I am a bit bored from working from home. But, it will be tiring moving around here and there. Teaching is fun for me. I really enjoy my work. I like my job and am doing well again. Tomorrow, I have to attend a mock lesson to improve my teaching skills. It should be ok. My students like me for now. I feel happy about this. I've decided to work while my French pal comes here. I need the money. Nobody is helping me so I need to be wise about money."

175963448,"Sorry, those thoughts are difficult to deal with. I have them a lot even when I'm feeling good. It sucks."
175963449,"I am in a relationship for 21 years with someone who is the total opposite of me and we do not get along. I hate the situation and feel stuck. I have allowed him to mistreat me, physically and mentally abuse me, cheat on me, talk about my family and get away with it. It has made me into a weak person with no confidence, low self esteem, think I'm ugly and fat, don't want to do anything. Just wish I would stop waking up every morning but as you can see, I'm still here. I hate life. There is nothing exciting about life. I have been walking through life in the days for the last 21 years. Its to the point where I have dreams of suicide. Its just feels like its time to go."
175963450,"Hi _PERSON_, I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing this breathlessness. It is miserable I know. I wouldn't be surprised if it was indeed environmental. Both issues you mention (the asphalt repaving and the dog hair) could indeed trigger allergy/reaction symptoms...which in turn triggered your anxiety, exacerbating the sensation. Hopefully both of these factors will be cleared soon, and you'll be back to feeling normal again. Until then use your anxiety management coping skills to get you through. Let us know how you are doing soon! S.C."

Damn they are delicious! Online dating wise, I messaged a couple women and even a text message to the woman I had a date with. I feel like I'm being someone I'm not considering my life experiences usually aren't in my level of social and poverty rank because of my messy career. Still, I'm start as fuk. This all comes down to how the millennials being handed a crap hand from the baby boomer's who failed to pay it forward from the generation that handed them everything on a silver platter. :-/ Yeah, I'm a bit jaded."
175963454,I get manic and psychotic when I don't sleep.
175963455,"Hi all, I suspect that my wife may be Borderline Personality Disorder or merely suffering from what I can only describe as sudden onset anxiety. Then as I read in another post, I begin to doubt myself. I used to think perhaps I was the problem; however I have seen a repeated and consistent cycle of events that suggest it might not be me, but still, I do not want to scapegoat her. Anyway, this is why I suspect something. My wife can be a loving affection person. When my wife is happy, she is HAPPY. She has a cute, mischievous laugh and is a joy to be around. We both are aware of what she terms ""shark week"" every month, and I am careful not to trigger ""events"" She recently began a hormone therapy receiving testosterone ""pellet"" subcutaneously and it was like a new person, then the injection wore off. And an old pattern returned. I suspected BPD, or perhaps she is just an adult from an abusive childhood. The only reason I doubt that it may be bipolar disorder is that usually ""something"" I did, 
she perceives I did she gets triggered, This can be something as simple as a misconstrued text message. When I think of it through it appears too ludicrous to warrant such behavior. The problem is this type of behavior is not limited to me. She will overtly overlay anger on anyone where she will not receive an immediate consequence, e.g. someone at work. But she will distance herself from that person extensively. Two years ago she developed such angst with co-workers she began to telework, thus avoiding the office entirely. She has been estranged from her mother for five years. When she ends any ""relationship"" there is a complete severance of contact. I have several times intervened and convinced her sometimes the conflict with her friend/parent/coworker might simply be a miscommunication often this will work out--until she perceives some slight unintended or not. She can be extreme in her anger and can go from being an affectionate laughing wife.... to full-blown anger in one sentence. I have often describ
ed it to her as ""it is like stomping on the gas peddle, and not being able to let off for weeks. Often something someone or I say in conversation with others that are seemingly innocuous, and she will take it in and dwell and dwell over and then erupt over something simple. Once she gets an idea in her head, she is like a bulldog dug in a _USER_ID_ of war. She can shut you out as if you never existed. Interestingly there also seems to be a cyclical, seasonal pattern to her behavior as well. Every early to mid-spring, she can get triggered over god knows what, and will blow this up in her mind to the point of she wants a divorce ... so remaining calm and giving her some space after a few months she seems to return to ""center."" The particular pattern has existed since I have known her (10 years). From many of our conversations, I have detected this pattern existed in other relationships- however, she refused to acknowledge the pattern. She does self medicate (alcohol) on a pretty regular basis and acknowledg
es this privately. She is hypersensitive to any form of perceived criticism --even if solicited. Recently after a fabulous eight months, she got upset over taxes (more was withheld from her check that mine and felt like she was being taken advantage of despite the overwhelming fact I spent far more money on the household leaving most of her ""wages"" for her use. So this triggers the I want a divorce routine again despite our not arguing since her last ""spring"" explosion. So at present, there is no communication despite attempts to open a dialogue, and I am currently staying in our other home (which is located four homes down from our first home. Regarding taxes, we do not have financial issues. So the question is: Am I misreading what I see is there an issue? I don't know, but I hope it's me. I would be grateful for any insights."
175963456,Yeah

175963464,"Miss _NAME_, Forgive me if I have caused you any trouble. I do not mean be controversial. I used to be so able to just go with the flow in life. Now I see such injustice. With covid running rampant I am having a hard time finding a psychiatrist who will take new patients. As a matter of fact my primary care dr has covid and is not seeing patients. Is it just too much to expect people to just do the right thing?? Please know my prayers are with everyone here. Suffering with anxiety is just the pits."
175963465,"I've been a patient in mental hospitals and psychiatric wards more than once. And while I was there, the psychiatrists would typically wear suit and ties, while patients like me were wearing just regular, everyday clothing. Just jeans and a sweatshirt (pretty much). I also noticed that some of the other patients didn't like the fact that the doctors were dressed up while the rest of us weren't. It gave some of them the feeling that it was us against them. I felt that was unfortunate. That's why I think that psychiatrists who work in hospitals shouldn't be dressed up in suit and ties, or at least not that much. I wouldn't want the doctors to be wearing messy clothing, of course. But do they really need to be dressed up in suit and ties considering that it bothers some of the patients in the hospitals?"
175963466,"Whoa, no. That would be torture. I find it very irritating when I'm listening to music and then someone in earshot starts listening to music (or maybe TV) at the same time. I either put headphones on or pause what I'm listening to. The way my mind works is very sequential. That sequence may be fast-moving and unexpected, but it's still one thing at a time, each one evoking the next. Whenever there's simultaneous competition for that one conscious spot, bad things happen. (That's what the ""attention deficit"" in the acronym means, the way I personally understand it.)"

So my sister made a post about her family getting kicked out of church because they refused to use sanitizer, which was required of them to be in the building for service. She posted how hand sanitizer has a lot of chemicals in it. But now that I think about it, isn’t it supposed to in order to kill bacteria and infection n shyt? Anyway. I had shown my mom the post because I thought it was slightly ridiculously funny. Sorry, I just think it is. I guess my sister offered to wash her hands but they wouldn’t let her. They wanted her to use hand sanitizer. Anyway there’s a whole bunch of people agreeing with her on her fb. Calling the church evil and all that. Anyway my mom called me later and she’s all drunk talking about “I don’t even want them to come to thanksgiving now. Why won’t they use hand sanitizer? Had I known they were like that I wouldn’t have asked them to come visit” And some other crap 
that I could barely make out cuz she been drinking. My family is a huge mess. At least them two. And I’m just tired and I don’t wanna go to my moms for thanksgiving. I just don’t man. I don’t."

For the last few days I’ve been feeling almost constantly out of breath and winded with the feeling of a faster heartbeat any time I move at all, standing up or walking around, even some when I’m just laying down. My family says it’s 100% my anxiety and they’re not worried at all. I’m not wheezing, or panting, or turning blue. But I definitely FEEL out if breath and it’s scaring me. Should this sensation be happening for three days in a row? Is it cause for concern? I’m 20 and in decent health, no real past of any major health problems, but I have severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder so it’s hard for me to tell if it’s anxiety or something I need to go to the hospital for."

Trust me, it was not easy but it's not hard either. Have you ever tried mindfulness activities? I use an app called headspace. I also went to therapy and, although I was against taking the medicine my doctor prescribed, it changed the way I function in my everyday life. I have not had a panic attack in WEEKS. YOU WILL BE OKAY. You must tell YOURSELF, key words, that it is in your head. When other people say it, it's not believable enough, so start telling yourself. Prayer also heals.

174352836,"Negative symptoms..* I'm tripping from weed. I got interested in what a user said about smoking it. People do smoke it for certain reasons. Again, in time, and again. I'm wondering what could bring me into psychosis and what tasks I should perform to prevent it? I'm going to read over my CBT therapy papers later. I wonder what magic my therapist knows and what she can teach me as it is CBT in relation to psychosis. That was the title. I guess certain people just get freaked out by certain thoughts naturally so they need antipsychotics but some can smoke weed without getting freaked out so that's why I feel like I have a chance. What I write becomes real sometimes. But the whole universe is just random. Unless you give in to the pain and emotions which turn them into realness. I get strong messages when I listen to music. There's certain symptoms that form energies to create disorders and such. Because disorders are just pictures of people that psychiatrists, mental patients and the public get colle
cted in their minds, in certain orders. So everyone has a different idea of what schizophrenia or bipolar is for example. Yet schizophrenia remains an interest for psychiatrists and doctors. Why? Are they interested in reality too and losing touch with it? Or do they actually want to help the patients? Some do.. I notice all of my psychiatrists except my current one actually cares. She feels empathy. The other doctors were more about EGO. Ego and empathy. When the ego is dissolved, you see empathy. And that is why my current psychiatrist is the most concerned. Just like my mom and sister. Because they have empathy. My dad has empathy but he's more masculine so he ignores it or is out of touch with it. Psychosis and other tragic things are concerning for people with empathy. The world needs more empathy.. but the ones that do are considered to be insane, creative and innovative. That is why I want to lower my injection. Because I can handle slight psychosis. I believe it makes me in touch of something that rea
lly identifies with my need for a better more real mind. A more beautiful mind."

175963506,"I've found the Melatonin works, also. It's sold at health food stores, drug stores, groceries in health section, maybe. I take 4 of the 1 mg., an hour before bedtime, so it has some time to take effect. Some people take it 2 or more hours before bedtime. Now I also have medicine for my bipolar (Lithium for mania and Mirtazapine antidepressant) so just taking 4 Melatonin at bedtime wouldn't put me to sleep if I didn't have the other meds. An hour later, at bedtime, I take a 5th Melatonin. If I go to bed at midnight and I wake up at about 4 or 5 a.m. and it looks like I'm not going back to sleep, I can take a 6th Melatonin. My psychiatrist says none of the health foods have been tested, like medicine has, and she doesn't like them. But I don't like taking sleeping pills, so a health food pill sounds better to me. I buy the 1 mg. size so I can alter how many I take. I find a heating pad can also help me go to sleep."

175963558,Awesome!!!!!
175963559,I let my mom read over what I wrote and she wasn't mad. So now I get to tell my doctor that I went over all of this with my mom. The biggest part about this is that I'm freaking out about it too much. I think it's because of knowing what it's like to be paranoid on weed - Especially when I smoked too much from my moms friends joint while on a hike - I was afraid of anyone knowing that I was high and paranoid. They were laughing and joking and I felt like they were laughing at me. I told my mom that I'm afraid of people making a big deal about my mental state and judging me and feeling like I need to go to the psych ward. But everything is fine. What I want out of this appointment is to stay on the same meds but be able to sleep - With either a PRN 5mg diazepam with the zopiclone or change both to temazepam (Because my doctor prefers that to zopiclone but he was on vacation so my moms doctor prescribed me zopiclone because he prefers that over temazepam). I don't want temazepam though because of it's 
longer half life. So everything is ok. I'm just sick and tired of this crap and want to not worry about meds and such.

175963565,"Part of me feels that I am sad because I cant be myself with others. I don't think that being sad, or crying, or being negative is a bad thing. I think that it is hard when you cannot express these feelings with others. So for me. when I am with people I play their game right. But when I am alone, I talk, I sing, I dance, I make sounds. I feel like if others would hear or see me when I am me, they would just think I am super obnoxious and noisy. So end result, I keep to myself a lot. But even there it is hard because unless I am alone in the house/building, I still can't be myself because I know people can hear me through the walls. Plus the one thing I enjoy is questioning everything especially life fundamentals and existential stuff. But most people hate talking about life/death and questioning their life. So I'm A) super sour with people or B) super fake. Which means to most people that see me at work our doing shopping. I seem fine. I'm actually always better then most people at tasks given to 
me so boss' always love me. Anyway, I think most people just don't have the courage to be sad. They think being positive and happy 100% of the time is the goal. I think it's stupid. They only get sad when they don't have a choice, when they lose someone or something really bad happens. And they don't know how to deal because they don't know how to be sad... If there was no fear of death, if there were no anxiety, if there were only happiness, we probably wouldn't be typing on computers.

The newest symptom i have been getting from 3 years ago which it stopped and returned full force the last couple of months. I can hear my heart beating in my ear and head it is very clear and sounds like my heart beat. When this happens my ear plug up and i feel horrible head pressure that i cannot not move. I feel like I'm going to loose consciousness. its a very scary feeling. Like I'm stuck in my body and can come out of it until i calm down. I have been taking clonazepam half of it when it happens and after 10 mins i start to feel a bit normal again. I am terrified that I have a brain tumor or brain cancer or anyerisum happening. Literally all those symptoms start happening at once. I literally try to find my purse take half a clonazepam and call someone to talk to and pace back in forth in my hallway until I feel a bit normal. 3 years ago I did go for test I had a CT Scan, 
MRI and MRA on my brain because of the Heart beating in my ear and got headaches from it. I saw 2 ENT, and Neurologist all normal. But for the life of me i cannot remember if it made me feel the way I do like I'm going to pass out and lose consciousness and blocked like I couldn't walk straight or sit because of pressure. Please if anyone has experienced this please respond. I don't know what to do. I am terrified."
175963570,I've also been intermittent fasting 20 hours and eating for 4 hours every 24 hours. I did that 3 days in a row. I get to eat at 8pm. It's giving me more energy (But also making my irritability a bit worse which is expected). I'm gonna do this for 3-4 weeks and see how my mood has changed. I want to be energized and feel like an ESTP.. I had an ice cold shower today after the walk.
175963571,"The cognitive effects that can happen with dissociative drugs (Ketamine for example are focus suppression, introspection, memory suppression, personal bias suppression, spatial disorientation, suggestibility enhancement, thought deceleration, time distortion, cognitive and physical disconnection, existential self-realization, identity alteration. You could be having depersonalization and derealization (Dissociation). It can last from an hour to a week or more. A benzo would help to get you out of it if you're also feeling anxious because of it. Seroquel or olanzepine can help too."

175963574,"That is the only form of 'together' rather than 'alone' I could tolerate if I were suffering, salles - someone with me but very quiet and unemotional, just present with me. That is rare, and I've only found it in a few people. Because most people's tendency is to talk, or offer solutions, or try way too hard to relate, or get sloppy emotional, etc, I prefer to be alone if I am in pain rather than have my pain amped up by having to also endure them being like that. This is a lovely way to put it."
175963575,"Back to work Monday. Always fun (sarcasm). I was so tempted to call in today and just stay in bed, but I made myself get up and come to work. So far no responses to the emails I sent on Monday so I feel a little stressed about that. I had to take xanax this morning because of the work stress. We are just crushed right now. I SH-_NAME_ yesterday. I see _PERSON_ tonight and then Regular T on Saturday. I'm not really worried about telling Regular T about it, but I am about telling Pastor _PERSON_. He's going to be like, did you call people first, did you do this, did you do that? IDK. I just coped, okay? Sheesh. Life is getting back to normal after the holidays. Class tomorrow.

175963587,"Sometimes I can just write and write and write. It's endless thoughts from all the pictures that I see in my mind. I had a glass of wine last night - I know it's not much but it made me extremely suicidal because I lost my imagination and felt like I had aphantasia. I was talking to people and was about to explain something but I could see any pictures while on the wine so I couldn't think of anything. I then went for a walk and listened to linkin park and a few other artists. I sat by the fire and then saw a star.. I thought to myself, ""Wow.. I've been trapped inside my head this whole time, thinking about my insignificant world"". I thought about how I'd be on a beach with people or when I watched a video about some spiritual guy sitting on the beach when the sun was going down and took acid. I think about how we used to be primal and lived in the forest before modern society was made and they used to look at the stars, moon etc and felt a sense of spirituality. I couldn't really feel that on th
e wine - And in that state, I feel like I'll never feel spiritual again. I listen to my little sister talking with her high school friends about drama and stupid things and my mom drinking and being dramatic. Who am I? What am I going to do with life? Am I cognitively inferior to everyone now that I'm mental and have fried my brain? I wanted to go inside and watch a Netflix show about the cosmos or black holes, mars or something.. But I told my mom that I felt suicidal so I stayed beside her in her bed, took a zopiclone and went to sleep. I had dreams that I seemed to be controlling. I ate a lot of weed edibles in my dream (Because I was thinking about that yesterday with _PERSON_) and was studying in school.. I was doing so much learning and studying in my dream that when I woke up, I felt exhausted. I'm so hard on myself - Even in my dreams. I was drawing engineering papers for a house that I was building in the oil _USER_ID_ - I tasted the oil and it tasted like canola oil. I was going to extract all of th
e oil from my land and be rich. Most of what I remember in my dreams were really intense but I can't recall them.. They fade away.. I take a few supplements, meds but there's no real hard drug that I'm taking. Yet all of these mild chemicals make me concerned more than when I was being reckless - Because I'm more aware and mature - And still even with that, I'm extremely careful and it effects me more than the cluster of drugs I was taking 4-5 years ago. Things will be ok. I just want to have a good mind. I think about what the people said to me on the video chat and it's so objective that I can't stand the realization of what everyone is doing - On social media, the politicians, the revolution and mindless arguing - About life, people having ****** relationships and sabotaging themselves - Not thinking.. I think lots.. I try to figure everything out.. I feel like in 1-2 years, I'll be better and able to find the right passion and make proper decisions - Having developed extroverted thinking a little bit more
.. I suffer. I listen to music. It all speaks to me and everyone is going through the same ****.. But think, feel.. People are staying at home, innovation is happening.. We're one organism and individually, we have no idea who we are because we can't know everything.. I'm tired, I'm exhausted, stressed, drained.. Idk if my brain cells are dying but I hope I don't have too many holes in my brain.. My brain is all I have."

If you have a 24-hour pharmacy, see if you can ask the pharmacist there for suggestions. If this doesn’t resolve soon, see if you can take a taxi to the ER or have someone drive you. I went to the ER 3-4 times in a month due to physical ailments wreaking havoc. The people there are there to help you."

A couple seizures followed by migraine, severe nausea that led to vomiting, nausea kept up for several days, and a hospital trip for possible UTI but it came back negative. Blood in my urine. Need to go to the health centre to follow up on that part this week. Dysphoria is strong as ever, which is making for misery around the clock. I am trying to cope but it's tough. Writing a draft letter to send to Trasek, the transgender activism organization in Finland, to see if they can help me with getting the treatments I need.

This will be in the future that we consider going off of Abilify. That is because right now I am pretty stable. And so that's good. I am switching from Zyprexa to Risperdal, as Risperdal has fewer side effects for me. I am also going down on Xanax, as that is contributing to me feeling flat.

175963641,"Ideas, especially creatively expressed, are like ""meals"" or drugs to me now. It used to be different forms of art but that went away. * Posts that require more reflection take me longer to reply to hence the delay. I find this beautiful. Another culture could be an internal or a spiritual (etc) layer of what is. They'll look at genius as an abnormality and thus wrong. Since I'm currently on the early childhood development train, I'd say this is true for many with mental health disorders especially at the extremes of and dissociative identity disorder and reactive attachment disorder (even disorganized attachment) - not just those genetically predisposed. I can see this in a variety of ways. At its more dreaded; fully psychotic, alone, at war with self and others. Or romanticized; mask after mask after mask, with no human-ness underneath. At its more aesthetic/artistic, a shapeshifter. And everything in between. Do you think you can be ""random personified"" with a core that's very purposeful rath
er than random all the way through? I'm interpreting this as a theme. An Inherent vs Aquired lack of imprint as opposed to those having an imprint, and I'm uncertain if I should ask for clarification of the last sentence. Beautiful translation. I've been trying to put that into words for a long time in regards to a few areas of my life. Still worth being that way though. To tangent, I was looking at how, to many, hurting people is ok when authority says it's the right thing to do, and how most people will obey that with little or no question - even if they don't want to. And yet, it's immoral or ""evil"" or sociopathic/psychopathic if one does it out of authority to self or reasons that make sense to self. People have tried to explain this to me, but have so far not been fully successful. It may be my own idealism, lack of imprint, and stubbornness (best I don't go too far in that direction since that's not a topic allowed to be examined at the moment). ^^^ I don't see how those things I just mentioned are co
nscious since I can't think of a culture that doesn't adhere to this one way or another. ? I think I do see your point though. I'm examining broad scale issues whilst you're trying to explain this in the context of personality. So (new term for me) pre-moral would be the processed food aka filter / cultural norms conditioned, implicit or unconscious. So when you say you use fat instead, you describe your own mode of filtering / customs, I'm assuming. I really like how you've created your own type of language. That sounds like you're describing the neuropsychology behind experience and behaviourism (or conditioning as you called it). When I was talking about the sieve analogy, I was referencing sensory filtration. The extra or too big of holes causing information to become jumbled - but also when managed, a point of creative genius. ^ Problems with ""Sensory Gating"" where people with psychotic disorders are believed to not always be able to tune out or categorize information from the environment and their rel
ationship to the overload of incoming information (internal and external). The role it (""dopamine hypothesis theory"") is claimed that dopamine plays a part in, is the more dopamine you have, the faster one's neurons are firing off and the more sensitive to input the brain is and the more likely sensory input is to be miscatagorized. I find this interesting on another tangent because it may apply to different ""languages"" of causation and thus treatment. I was watching something on ADHD where the doctor was talking about how addressing the proper workings of points a, b, and c, would actually have the same effect as treating the kid based on brain chemistry aka drugging the $#%^ out of them. Speaking of which, I'd love it if you felt like translating (your analogies) how ADHD works if you're at all familiar with it. Do you have an example of what activities can lead being made to go from ""a"" directly to ""c"" causing ""b"" to become invisible and inexistant albeit needed? Is this in the application of bei
ng taught or conditioned? Is it doing what you've been conditioned to do without not fully connecting why and then being expected to use it transferably. Then you have a go and then really having no idea why and as a result, when other related areas are expected for you to be able to, again, transfer you end up lost as hell? Needing ""b,"" but it's not there, resonates deeply with me, and I'm trying to understand why. Also descriptive of the ADHD treatment situation I just mentioned. Beautiful analogy. Benzodiazepines as well. Do you think primate child rearing has gotten worst or that we're just more aware of the issues correlated to it? Or that the landscape has changed and they haven't (yet?) adapted? If they be a personality trait, yes. A different issue? I would think that's just a way a personality forms (how and if someone is groomed)... And what if one is genetically predisposed to be hypersensitive to stress, and as a result, normal solutions are ineffective and so they end creating odd beliefs to co
pe? Very, very true. Setting clashes and resulting discomfort aside, this is a fantastic direction to head in as far as I'm concerned - although I know many, oftentimes monsters, disagree. No reason to go back because by independently thinking, all the cancer-causing, poisonous, monster ingredients they saturate canned food and cured meat with, becomes repulsively visible. Others do not see it. Almost ever do they not see it. ^ Aside from predisposed challenger types. If they can keep their heads out of their asses, they see it too. They usually have the skills to work with it though. True; however, I've only seen people go on to thrive if they befriend their mistrust - rather than trying to squelch it or put it in a box under their bed with the other monsters (that also never go away and need to either also be befriended - or lobotomized instead). Regardless, probably shouldn't be left alone, and in private, with things as alluring as trinkets like trust and mistrust. That's a good point, unfortunately. When 
adopting solutions that should work - and fast do work decent for most - even when some trust is drummed up, but they do not work no matter how hard one tries: - Does it go back to ingrain personality and not having imprints then? Ideal, but there's never been a time when actual Sovereignty to God actually existed. You're describing the way things worked in New Testament as well as present day and time in between. Authority, customs, courtiers, priests, people who want the king's head, enforcers = Almost all monsters. I was seeing it more from the angle of resilience. The fact that there's an overgrown bridge, full of potholes, covered in grass, where no carts (essential for modern day primates to function) have the ability to access, yet if deemed desirable or necessary, some are able and continue to be able to cross that bridge - even if it's barely held together by rotted, crumbling wooden slabs and shakey sinew. Of the posts/interactions you've seen me, am I poorly behaved? Something for me to think about
. I'm uncertain I agree; granted there are a lot of things people can do to improve their existence. Not everyone is bound to earth by a desire to be here - they may still have a point in living, fortunately or unfortunately. If it was that easy it could be one way of a large scale depopulation of the planet. Two things here. Firstly, carrion eating animals like crows and (well-fed) komodo dragons sound like very desirable company to keep. And, I'm curious now what a well-fed vulture's disposition is like - some are kind of cute. Seriously. Secondly, ""keep hoping for dead things"" is fascinating because a theme in past non-drug-induced psychotic symptoms was seeing flies. When I meditated upon it, that's why they were there. Another world I walked in, parallel to what I could see - the world of me, was barren and there was something(s) decomposing. Decomposition so bad that the flies made it over to my conscious perception of reality. It was exactly that. Hoping for dead things. So many potential layers to t
his. I'm going to choose to stick with the surface concept of something metaphorical or benign haruspicy. You have a catagory for actual humans too then (what you consider to be real ""men"")? Beautiful... and foreboding. I wonder if you put a lot of planning into this or if it was a sort of intuitive finding out of how relevant the symbolism was. You're familiar with the fact that in less processed cultures, people with schizo and/or psychotic symptoms, lack filters/imprints, have been seen more as ""shamans"" / ""medicine people"" / teachers / people who walk between the different worlds? Looking at your command of metaphorical language and talent for creating fables, might just have been born in the wrong place or time rather than having a personality disorder. Agree, double standards. Guess they keep people in check. Kinda like what PolarBear said, it keeps things in working order for many (if I understood correctly). What a joy it is to know, one doesn't owe anyone ###$ all. More double standards in this 
too though. It's ok to be an idiot, but it's frowned upon to try to sidle your way out of an idiot's agendas (in general, not voting in particular)."

I even have to try and sleep with zopiclone although I'm going into a sleep state this past week.. I've been sleeping 30-60 minutes more every night for a week.. You got off the mirtazepine though! That's good.. Just wait a while (Few months) for withdrawal to lessen and then you'll be able to sleep better. 7.5mg of zopiclone and 5mg of olanzepine puts me right to sleep.. I slept 13 hours last night. I wake up in the middle of the night to eat SUGAR.. I feel the diabetes coming.. Idk.. I'm ok with waking up in the middle of the night because I always go back to sleep due to sleep inertia - That's why if I don't take Vyvanse, I'm constantly in sleep inertia... For months, years..

I think when we’re alone our symptoms can be different than when we’re having symptoms with people around. I get that with the tv and radio too. Your #1 for me is : I hear “the voices” and the meaning of the words to me can spark my tactiles, especially when I’m feeling down or sick..usually negative tactiles when I feel like s$it. I’ve watched YouTube videos that people make not correct information videos about schizophrenia that would hurt schizophrenics. Not what the titles say but if you really listen, I can hear how they really are on the other side of caring about us and is quite the opposite side of the spectrum, they can get away with it because it’s a personal view. I have family blackmail happening to me. They don’t want to answer for how they mishandled my situations and actually blame the victim. #5 I lose my place sometim
es and I feel like it’s because of the voices but it might be because I’m human and do forget but I can fight with my voices to recover the memory but I really have to fight them.. #7 that’s probably where the _NAME_ show delusion stems from. #9 held a cup up to my ear when I heard a voice coming from the front left corner of room but couldn’t hear it when the cup was directing my hearing in a different direction. #11 I’ve been hearing something different than the tinnitus I heard before my diagnosis. Humming loud. Hate It. #14 my family makes me feel like that because they don’t let me speak about my illness. I have been thinking about myself as the family dog and not on their level because they wouldn’t do anything at all."

175963674,"Yes, thanks for keeping us up to date. I've been in some turbulent situations, also, and didn't have a whole lot of help with it, so I know how tough that can be. You said earlier she was on ""both Olanzapine and Valproate"" with the first being an anti-psychotic and the second used to treat seizures. As an amateur, I don't see any anti-depressant there or a mood stabilizer like Lithium which is what I take. I don't see anything to treat depression or mania. I was given an anti-psychotic (which is sometimes used to treat bipolar I've read and experienced). It was called ""Stelizine"" (sp?) It's an old style anti-psychotic, and the newer ones are supposed to be less severe. It gave me panic attacks and was supposed to be treating my mania and my depression. I heard in some countries, they use it for torture. It took away my severe anger that I was in, but it also stripped me of all other emotions including good. So, when you say, ""her mood was very stable when she was on the anti-psychotic (Olanzap
ine) but she was more like a zombie who couldn't feel much"" I kinda want to jump up and down. That's exactly how I felt on Stelazine anti-psychotic. It was torture. I had no emotions. To think they are still giving that medicine decades later after I had that and still having the same results is impossible for me to believe. Now, it must work for some people for from time to time here people who are bipolar say they are on an anti-psychotic. I know someone who was given Stelazine because he was so angry so much, but it wasn't the first medicine they gave him, but only when all else had failed. But that's my guess as to why she felt like a zombie on an anti-psychotic. You can look up the side affects of that medicine by typing in the name on the search engine. You said, ""...just curious why you say I'm in a precarious position...? As in lifetime of uncertainty perhaps...?"" One reason I said that is, the way you described your wife: “A few days ago (and over the course of a few days developing), she starte
d to have mood changes, being suddenly energetic, suddenly lethargic, having impaired judgment, hearing voices, not sleeping at all for a few days, grand ideas about getting a new place and applying for new jobs, not being able to focus (blank stare), withdrawing from me and our activities totally, fingers twitching every few seconds, suddenly bursting into tears, irrational fear of dust mites and seeing black shadows in the room. PHEW I think that's about it. ” With the doctor's help, she had dropped the anti-psychotic and was only on the other medicine and did OK for a year, you said. Well, she's obviously not on the right medicine if she's acting the way you described above, and now nobody even knows where she is. The second reason I said you were in a precarious position is, from looking at the net, it is saying psychiatric care in your part of the world is not the best. I have seen many a bad psychiatrist, but for your wife to be acting like she is and now she is missing, tells me she is not on the rig
ht medicine. She may not have been diagnosed right. Was she depressed a lot, and then manic, mind racing, trouble sleeping, couldn't concentrate? (You can look up the symptoms on the net by typing in ""bipolar"" on the search engine. Looking at that, do you think she's bipolar?) That's why I said you're in a precarious position. Even when she's at the doctor's, she may not be getting good help. Tell me what you think her diagnosis is, as far as being bipolar, then look at the suggested medicines for that, and see if you think she was getting the right meds."

Get up, get breakfast, make sure I already have my drinks cold and ready, sit down, play my creative playlist, and move my pen, or just read (i still hold my pen even when I read), the earlier the better, by 11am if possible. I lament though, because I don't commit to many things, like the basics of hygiene, and cleaning my room and bathroom, but I have small wins with my creativity, and I feel like those will outlast my life, at least I hope. Things you want to do, versus things your heart desires in life. I understand that I'm deeply ill and flawed, so I look over the small stuff, and focus on what my heart desires, because without those, i fear my life would be empty.

175963694,"Hi! I've not been on the forum posting much anymore due to coping well with PD and life in general. When i read your story, freaking similar to what i experienced. Other than the country and occupation, i was also jolted awake one day in 2015 feeling the exact same issues that you did, yet somehow being able to cycle to the nearest hospital in my town in japan. I just graduated from post grad and felt that i was wasting my time still hanging around in japan, aka no money/income and feeling bad. Fast forward, turning up on HW forums, reading stuff, writing journal entries, meditation helped me alot. I would get that heart pumping thingy and can't be able to sleep(Yes, it is horrible), but since my mom sent me a buddhist chanting song, I just had it on my earphones in a soft volume and practiced meditation. Honestly, i had no avenue or didn't know where to get help other than HW and it was horrible. 1 Year down, I'm back in Singapore, feeling all strange and having light sensitivity, depersonalizatio
n at times, feeling that theres a glossy vision and getting random mild panics. Though I've only gotten 2 full blown Panic attacks 1 in Japan 1 in Malaysia, I can relate to your random mindblowing mild panic symptoms. Now in 2020, i'm almost 80-90% fine. Realised that the triggers to such conditions, random caffeine intake(coffee/cola) at times, but potent on an empty stomach, and usually stomach issues(gut). If my stomach is fine, i'm fine. I did go for psychological counselling in 2016 and that taught me a good range of coping techniques as well. Long story short, you'll get there. PD is pretty common. First few months to a year sucks. But keep on the road, eat healthy, decaf. Recognise the triggers will be the best. Best of health to you! I did use Xanax when i get a full blown PA in malaysia. But that's all for the drug use. After i realised the triggers I managed to get over it. And imo, 20-30mins of random PA symptoms i can still manage. Though it tires the heck outta me :P"

Now many years later my son is going through exactly what's happening to you. Depending on how bad your anxiety might be, another form of medication may or may not help you. In his case, it does seem to be helping him although he is still too afraid to try weed again. He described it as similar to a terrible acid trip. What the dispensary recommended for my son was pretty much what _PERSON_ said: try a CBD:THC ratio product, maybe go with something at first that is low in THC. The indica/sativa thing is debatable but certain strains definitely work better for me and it all seems to be relative to the person. If it really helps you and you stick with it, I'm sure you can find that right blend for you. Peace my toking friend! May you be anxiety free!"
175963700,"I got disability due to OCD. It is my understanding that personality disorders do not qualify as conditions that warrant government assistance. In order to get it, you need to be seeing a mental health professional. Disability does not care to hear about your hardships. If you are deemed disabled, it is because the psychiatrist/psychologist checked off the appropriate box on the government form they were sent after you applied for disability. Also, be aware that if you begin to see someone on the basis that you ""need disability"", it may be harder to get a sufficient diagnosis. For every person on disability, there is someone looking to get it without it being warranted. If you're in the US and are talking about Social Security, most claims are denied the first time around. They know that people who are truly suffering and compromised will persist whereas fakers will have less incentive to push ahead with legal aid, which is sometimes necessary.

I like to write essays for fun, but that’s not useful, so I just write whatever. I study so much stuff on google. It has helped me to succeed. Most definitely, with my published work and whatnot."
175963734,I know that feeling. That's why I resort to drinking in order to tap into motivation. Drinking to get the motivation to read and write. That's a dangerous habit.
175963735,"No, it was not your fault. In such a situation, you were likely shocked and confused. This was an authority figure, we are taught to obey our teachers. Perhaps you also even liked this person, or looked up to them, or had desired their approval, you likely trusted him. You were in a power dynamic where he had all the power. This is the kind of situation that predators take advantage of. This guilt and feeling that you caused it happens to every child that is abused by someone they trusted. But it is not your fault. I also saw your posting to _PERSON_, and I understand that it is way more difficult because you're in Iran. How old are you? Perhaps you can privately get therapy online without anyone's knowledge? I think you can get it for a reasonable price. Are you sure there isn't a person you can trust to talk to about it? Someone who will be discreet and supportive. There are likely some groups there that deal with child abuse and offer therapy, maybe you could google that? Remember to be kind to 
yourself. You are not responsible for what happened."
174353207,I don't know why I get so obsessed over meds. It seems like every time I go for a walk my brain goes to hypotheticals of my Haldol being upped or being put on Clozapine.
175963736,"As a two-bit hack writer, I like talking about my stories that no one reads. I like this character I have so far, so I share it with you all so you can roll your eyes, laugh at me, and tell me how stupid and terrible I am I felt accomplished for coming up with that by myself. Why? I don't know, I did, Cash money"
175963737,"When I’m not feeling well mentally and can’t sleep I stay up late watching movies, mostly ones having to do with mental illness.

175963740,"I have 17 refills of 20x 5mg olanzepine ""Take once as needed for paranoia"" but I haven't used one in like 3 months. It only makes sense to decrease the Invega injection from 150mg to 100mg and if I get symptoms, I can just use the olanzepine. If I don't get symptoms, great! I don't see what the big deal is"

175963742,"I'm hoping that there might be people out there who can help me understand something that I am going through right now. I didn't know if this should've been posted in the sexual health community, but I feel like this is all tied with the feelings I'm having trying to cope with the loss of some loved ones recently. My Aunt suffered from depression and she committed suicide in March in 2019 and then in August my older brother passed away. He had Type I diabetes and just refused to take proper care of himself and eventually it caught up to him, but his loss was sudden and completely devastating to my family. I've been having a hard time with it. There are good days but there are very bad days as well. My fiance tries to be supportive of my feelings, but sometimes when I tell him that I had a bad day and was thinking about my brother he'll ask me why I was thinking about him and I have no answer for him. It's the tiniest thing things that will make me think of him, so small that sometimes I don't even 
understand what it was that caused the thoughts to start myself, but a lot of the time I don't feel like I should have to explain why so I'll keep it to myself and in a way ""suffer in silence."" I have a tendency to not talk to anyone else either as I don't want to burden them with my problems and there seems to be an acceptable window of time that people are understanding about you feeling grief, but that time frame has long since passed and people don't seem to be sympathetic anymore. About 1 1/2 months after my brothers death, my now-fiance proposed to me and I feel terrible because I've had pretty much no sex drive for a while now. I think it started gradually after my aunts death and then when my brother died it just killed all feeling of sexual desire I had left. I still crave emotional intimacy and need physical affection, but whenever he tries to get physically intimate with me I freeze up and can't bring myself to feel anything. My fiance suffers from anxiety and I know that he thinks I'm not attrac
ted to him anymore, especially because he's gained some weight over the years we've been together, but that really has nothing to do with it and I wish I could find the right words to explain what's wrong with me, but I honestly just don't know how because I don't understand it myself. I've always had a healthy libido and we used to have sex multiple times a week but now we're lucky to have sex more than once a month. Can someone explain why I've had this drastic change and how I can go about changing it? My fiance has never tried to pressure me into doing anything I don't want, but I can see the hurt in his eyes when I turn down his advances and I feel like if I can get to the root of my issues and find a way to deal with them we would both be so much happier. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
174353215,I'm tired!! I have been tired all day. I cleaned the house though because my mother was barking up and down everywhere. I feel ok but feel lethargic.
175963743,I had the fibroid surgery done already. I have anxiety about when the pain from the surgery will go away ya. I don't really like dealing with the pain though. Can some one give me advice on how to have less anxiety after having the surgery though. Thanks.
175963744,I'm an autopilot. It's as though I've been programmed just to do and not to think or feel.
175963745,"Thank you, I'm sorry to hear that - but at the same time, relieved to know i'm not the only one. I will try the mantra idea. Sounds like it might benefit me. I really don't want to self harm, either. It seemed to have really worked last time - I best describe it as my stress, depression, anxiety, all of that was a rapidly filling balloon. When I self harmed before, it was like I was slashing the balloon, calming and relaxing my nerves. But at the same time, everyone noticed when there were enough cuts, and said it was all just for attention. I wish people would grow up and realize that mental health is as real as any physical ailment, and that it needs to be taken seriously... Unfortunately... it's not."

I did yesterday. there's a few things I want to work on, I need to come up with designs for 3 Christmas cards Someone is talking really loud it sounds like they're arguing on the phone, aggravating,weird since my neighbor is an old guy who goes to sleep at like 7 and there's a brick wall on the other side"

175963762,Hugs dude.....
175963763,"So it occurs to me that I’m very med oriented to the point where I can see people becoming more depressed or psychotic after reducing meds or changing them. I feel like in a way the meds define who we are. The med you pick as your final med can change your very personality, how ambitious you are, how sad, how able to work or not. There is a continuum between medicine and illness though. A lot of people want to be off meds entirely but then they often become more ill, and the illness dominates them. But then they are their true self for better or worse. People are all different so where in the continuum between meds and illness do you see yourself? I’m asking this because I don’t want to promote meds as the perfect solution for everyone if they aren’t. Let’s say pro meds is 1........and 10 is no meds with the normal range in between. Where do you lie on that range? I realize that for some meds don’t work, but this q is directed at people that they work for at least partially."
175963764,I don’t have any vraylar and of course I’ve been up all night and feel great. Ugh. I can only think of what’s to come.
175963765,"Hey everyone. I'm on page 27 of my book now. Most if it is figured out, but I'm losing focus and discipline. I don't know what's going on, but I can't stay focused. I think it's because I normally go out and force myself to work without distractions. I'd feel embarrassed watching a movie or show at a café or bar. Plus I feel trapped in my room because the little one's are here and would never enjoy the weird stuff I want to watch like Westworld or Watchmen. No way I could go out there to write either. I like to disappear in the background noise. The kids got in a fight yesterday, so they are in their own corners. lol nobody wants to be here but my roommate because she's at work. Michigan governor said its going to last until april 30th now. I think the kids are going to be here for another two weeks because my roommate pushed for it. Okay, from now on, I'm going to write in the shed. Maybe that will be a better place. I see some areas where I should mow too."

175963767,"I’m doing so much. All kinds of things. I literally could probably count about, if not, 30 different things I’m doing with my life right now. I still feel a void in me. A hole that hasn’t been filled."
175963768,"Ok. So I have been going through a lot of stress trying to bring myself to a decision that would determine the course of the rest of my life. Should I give him a second chance? I dated my ex for 3 yrs while we were still in our early 20s him being 2 yrs older. I’d like to believe we were young and dumb and because of that we both have the potential to evolve and change. He was abusive(not to the point of serious harm but still hit me sometimes and made me feel powerless). He grew up in the street( sometimes ppl have no other choice) and was and still is very good at communicating with anyone, very persuasive and can mentally understand everyone he came across. I guess you can say a mind fuk psychological genius. That’s one of the reasons I loved him so much. He was unlike anyone I ever knew. Things like that can’t be taught but only learned by circumstance. Anyways although he couldn’t support us financially he is a go-getter and where ever I fell short in money, he would go hustle and help 
make ends meet. He had my back. And despite some emotional and mental pain, he made me stronger. Taught me things I would never have learned. Toughened me up mentally and physically. We also had a lot of fun together. We connected on a level that is nearly impossible to reciprocate. Naturally though a part of me was growing tired and wanted to get away from it all. So when he went to jail for 5 yrs(petty crime trying to provide for us-broken justice system), I found my escape opportunity. Still though I couldn’t let go. I still accepted his jail calls and he still makes my heart melt. I’ve tried to convince myself to move on but I can’t. I can hear the changes he has made mentally. The way he speaks, the way his thought process works, the way he has ambitions now have all elevated from being locked up and confined to nothing but his own mind. It sounds like he is no longer this little boy drug dealer but a man who is hungry for success because of where he has been and what he has learned. He still loves 
me and will always love me and he is begging for me to give him a second chance to show me that he can be the man I deserve. I can’t even count how many apologies and vulnerability speeches he has given. Of course actions speak louder than words but should someone like this deserve a 2nd chance even if the memory of pain will always be there. Is it possible to fully heal from the past and allow him to reconstruct a better future. A part of me wants to let go because of what he did but a part of me also does not want to give the next woman a rare diamond that my pressure and pain helped craft. Yes I still love him and to this day he is the only person that truest understands me mentally and can elevate me to my highest growth. Do I deserve a more subtle relationship with someone else. Has our relationship been tainted beyond repair? I just don’t know what to do. Have I given to many sacrifices to give anymore? What are your thought?"
175963769,What's the algae for?
175963770,"I spend a lot of time trying to fit in and to be like everyone else, but then when someone sees me like everyone else, then something inside of me is sad because not everyone else goes through Mental Illness and stuff like that. So then I'm like dang it! Not that I'm special in any way but IDK, I can't be like everyone else either. Sigh."

I wonder if I could hide a flask in here. I can't get benzos here but a flask is doable. If someone nearby would fill it and bring it back. I wonder if anyone can smoke pot here once it's legal. Hoping those three guys are ok. Hoping I'll get the vaccine before I get covid. They've been testing me everyday. Do they know something I don't?

175963786,"That sucks but glad you reached out. I’m not the best at advice but think about nourishing yourself as a goal and try to take your image out of it. You have to eat to live. There are probably some free resources online somewhere that can help, or even a workbook. Point is don’t ignore the feelings and let them escalate.

175963788,I dont feel good. I feel nauseous. And I have a headache. But I always feel a bit nauseous after taking my meds in the morning. The headache could be from yesterday when I strained my neck being on my phone all evening.
175963789,"I just woke up. Dont know why I slept so long. But I have to get up early every day and it's a bit of a struggle, plus I was up from 2am to 4M last night. I think it's both those reasons. Catching up on sleep on my day off and not being able to sleep well last night."

175963794,"My mind is really open right now. I'm quite interested in technology and ""The Theory of Everything"" or anything like that because reading about religion is so subjective like I understand it all. If I read about Islam or Christianity, it's all coded language for what I already know so I'll leave that for another time. Sometimes I wish I never took psychedelics so I'm more interested in ""figuring everything out"", then I try them.

175963796,"Yes he is. I asked him if he still wants to go and he says yes, but for welding instead of auto mechanics. Which in some ways is good. You can get paid for welding a lloottt more and there seems to be a good set of welding jobs out here in the rural area. Plus he could work here in town instead of driving 30 min out to another county to work. I feel bad because I told him he should get the job at my dads work but that was when I had just met him. Welding Can be up to 50 dollars an hour or more. Auto tech is like 25 to 30 an hour. I don’t think he should get an AAS tho. I think he should get a certification. I really don’t him to fail because he has to take composition and mathematics and humanities course for the AAS. Because he has adhd. His said he has no dreams in life. Just wants to do a job with his hands and live comfortably."
175963797,"I could take a Xanax but I won't unless I get depersonalization - Especially when I get derealization. When I get derealization a couple hours before bed (When I can take a zopiclone), I'm completely screwed. But it's good to not take one - Cuz it all adds up. You have to think of not taking one with positivity like quitting smoking or something. So if you think your anxiety is bad enough, take. I would try to distract myself and contact my prescriber tomorrow - Although it could be stress induced so try to relax the best way that you can."

175963799,"Mine started outside. First like coming from somebody's radio, so I didn't know they were connected to me. When I finally knew I had voices, they were in front of me. After that, they were everywhere around me. One of the voices could make it seem like he was calling out to me from a different room. Later on they were outside & inside my head. Inside it's like I have a hallway on the left side & they sometimes sound up close, & other times like they're down the hallway, even in a room at the end of the hallway with the door open or partly closed. On the right side it's different, more like open spaces. And a certain one seems to prefer that side, & is more of a loner. But the other voices talk on the right side from time to time. They talk to me & they talk to each other. And they also sing, & very well."

174353282,"Hello. I am new to this forum and just looking for support regarding my partner's (of 5 years) schizoaffective diagnosis. He was diagnosed in May and has been on Vraylar since June. He only started therapy a week ago. While I have noticed a huge improvement, and he has too, he does something that I am unfamiliar with, though my own therapist told me is normal for someone with schizoaffective disorder. He disappears. He'll go out for a walk and won't come back for hours. And by hours I mean 6, 12, 24, and the latest - 32 hours. He'll sleep on a park bench, walk around, etc. He told me yesterday when he got back that he contemplated suicide. Is this normal?? I am struggling with it so hard core. The intense worry, anxiety, fear, concern, all of it comes out in complete rage when he finally comes home because I am so hurt and upset that he didn't contact me or respond to my numerous texts and calls. He tried to explain that he gets in his head and he can't promise he won't be gone for an extended peri
od of time again. This time I reached my breaking point and I'm not sure if I can do this anymore but I really wanted to reach out to people with this disorder or someone with more knowledge and ask your thoughts. Why is this happening? Can he do anything to lessen it or does that all come from right meds and good therapy? I'm so past my breaking point with this I don't even know what to do besides run for the hills. Help."
175963812,"Recovering from serious mental health issues is never a smooth process. And it takes time. Psychotherapy is a slow process, and therapists know this. They don't expect their clients to get a lot better overnight. And they know their clients won't recover smoothly either. Hitting ruts/walls while trying to recover is normal."

I remember it vaguely and I did hear voices time to time during my childhood but hasn't gone out of control until I cut myself at 18 almost 19 years old because voices told me to do so.

175963839,"When I think about shame I think about my early childhood. I was reprimanded a lot for my behavior which I mostly attribute to my mental illness. As a child, being Bipolar II can result in not necessarily odd behavior but hints of mania that opens the door to be shut down. I wasn’t made to think I was “bad” or anything but the harsh discipline my parents imposed led to feelings of shame. As an adult I still carry shame with me. Given certain situations usually I automatically think I am wrong, or overstate the word sorry when I’m not at fault, and that is a ramification of internal shame. It has weighed heavily on my shoulders and only now at 42-years-old, I am starting to work on recognizing that feeling and try and push it away. It’s a challenge cause since it was formed at such a young age, it’s almost ingrained in me or a part of my personality and I don’t even know if you can change a personality. You can work on behaviors but when shame is intrinsic to your being it’s a strugg
le. I have to make a conscious effort to stop myself when feelings of shame surface, and examine the situation that brings forth feelings of shame to try and circumvent that feeling. It can be something minor like I hear a harsh tone of someone’s voice and it becomes a trigger for shame which stems from recalling my father’s harsh tone when reprimanding me. Or someone says, “We need to talk.” I’ll immediately think something is wrong, and whatever it is, it’s my fault. It’s wild to think I have spent a lifetime lingering in shame and only now am I starting to understand to fathom it, and want to do the hard work to try and diminish it. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/manic-depression/2019/06/30/shame-on-you-shame-on-me/"

175963847,"How on earth do you know so much about so many things?! I've never heard of Diognenes the Cynic until now. I did a quick search and it said he was looking for an honest man - you're saying he never found one. Have you read _PERSON_ The Devil and Miss Prym? The search was whether human nature is ""good"" or ""evil"" rather than honesty. I liked it more than his famous book, The Alchemist. I found it good timing because I'd had a drug-induced psychotic break back when I was 19 and I ended up experiencing auditory hallucinations with the onset of them waking me up in the middle of the night in the psychward commanding that I preform an act of violence that isn't at all in my nature. I got up to do it, but stopped myself and it was a battle within myself that ended in my requesting the psych nurse to put me in the lock up room. After that, I wondered if I was ""evil"" by nature (given that it was difficult to fight myself from acting that night, and I had absolutely no motive) - and if I'd have to cons
tantly be on guard against myself. Later down the road, after I got clean, I stumbled upon the book and it served as the first adequate answer to my nature. Simple answer that we're ""good"" and ""evil"" together by nature - not sure why it took me so much to understand that Then in a psychology class I took in the fall (different from the one I already mentioned) our professor talked about some of the different theories on human nature. How there was a time children were believed to be born immoral and another time when they were born ""good"" instead of taught. Then he brought up how easy it is to corrupt children - make them into murderers and thieves, etc. He used children from the Gulags as an example - that criminals could ""enlist"" children to commit henious crimes, but the children's parents would often refuse to commit the same acts. His other example was somewhere that authorities found it relatively easy to get children rat their parents out and even kill them - genocide to create a new country so
ciety (maybe south America somewhere?) or something like that It was confusing. I was also left very confused because what about children who are raised with ""immorality"" but grow up with a strong ""conscience"" that was not taught. I'm also a bit confused how the hermit reflects Polar Bear lifestyle given you don't sound like a fan of humanism. That fits the High Priestess to me too - I'd never thought of it before! Interesting: distributive and retributive; fairness. That first bit sounds like the Six of Pentacles. I still feel like it's one the ones I don't have a thorough enough understanding of, but I really like the way you explain things. The sky and movement theme had never occurred to me before I see Temperance as an alchemist, but it's another one I don't understand well enough. Brilliant! I did, I was thinking between talented people who know what they're doing and pretenders. Fascinating! I'm values based (my own values anyways), and I'm an idealist the way Justice is, I think. Very interesting! 
I'm interested to look over ""An Aristotelian View of _PERSON_ Method"" when I get some more time. I'm a slow processor of information, unfortunately. Again, makes sense Cancer starts out as individual units that try to be something they're not. Blessed are those you desribed: ""if you truly are an individual, you just are, and the idea of authenticity does not even come."" ^ Blessed and a dying breed. I'm only authentic. It's not natural to be yourself anymore. In my perspective, ""authenticity"" strives for that even if it's not a full ""you just are"" Polar bear mentality Deception is the goal in primates hence why your Diognenes the Cynic friend never found an ""honest man"" I was going to ask the same thing, why create something to dehumanize it. That's like cats toying and slowly killing a mouse or bird, and see, that's not innocent like it would be if a snake ate or killed its human (nor would it be innocent if a cat started eating its human's decomposing body). And then humanists, as you describe them
, would jump on the wagon for an opportunity of freedom and make things up as they go They knew/were told it would enslave them? Interesting, I wouldn't call myself an activist, but I'm often driven by the motive helping others (service). When one has anger or hatred or rage it makes fantastic gasoline. Those who have full capacity for and full use of their empathy, yet condescend and have not an ounce of kindness or decency for broken people, make lovely wooden pallets. Otherwise they just rot and take up space. The destroyed kingdom would be about the beauty in the flames kissing the heavens in thanks for such a wonderful opportunity to return the scum to the earth in hopeful exchange for something possibly more useful. Some valuable forms of life only sprout up from fertile ashes. I'd not say I'm the tyrannical type though. Way too much responsibility, redundancy and suffocation to lead or boss people around (for long) ^ Desire for my freedom I guess Security for others who can't stand up for themselves is 
good too. As long I get to maintain my freedom I see it as the opposite. People achieve ""unhappiness"" because all they seek is ""happiness."" That's about the only value primates have left. Seek happiness through trying to achieve status, trying to achieve wealth, trying to hoard up on things, plastic surgeries, fancy clothes, trying to make themselves look at perfect as possible, using and drinking or shopping/sex/gambling/adrenaline addictions, seeking relationships for the sake of a relationship rather than a person, seeking ""to destroy other's happiness"" to feel better about themselves, and on and on and on. ^ Not to deny there isn't some good in a lot of those things when it's not an obsessive compulsive attempt at happiness. I think I may have meant the humanist freedom goal is an attempt to make them happy? If we're going to complicate things, ""seeking unhappiness"" is also fulfilling for a lot of people and thus in some way it does make them happy. So I guess you're right, a lot of people have th
e goal ""not to be happy"" - including +80% of the MeToo women and Incel men Differences between the genders is great, but separating as in pitting men and women against each other is definitely a serious issue to me. The Me Too movement, now a runaway train (as we've both already said), is an opportunity to proclaim victimization (80% of the time). ^ The same way PTSD was a ""trendy"" diagnosis that literally almost everybody had for the longest time and people would proudly announce that they had it, yet remain magically free of any and all debilitating symptoms associated with it. It was like talking about being vegan these days or only organic. Now two drunk people have sex and the woman is a rape victim. Hell, she could have initiated and had a great time but not remembered it in the morning and then it becomes ""How could he do that to me?!"" Men start to become weary and avoid women (aside from sex relations of course). The normative compassion and ability to try to relate to each other doesn't get a c
hance to form anymore due to the segregation. ^ What is it developmentally? After you mature into tolerance of differences, you learn to enjoy or at least respect them. That stops happening between men and women. Men express fear that they don't want to end up in situations that could set them up for false accusations. Women get enraged and their argument is they've had to work for men and they dismiss the concerns because it's rare for false accusations to happen = ""necessary evil"" (I don't think we actually know how rare or common it is, but they're certainly biased). Animosity kills compassion = increase in disrespect, abusive relationships and actual assaults between the sexes. Moreover, the women (or men) who do end up badly abused and aren't borderline enough to think they enjoy it, cannot receive the help they need because it's ""victim blaming"" and ""sexist"" to point out ways of thinking and acting that need to be addressed. Then men continue be given sole responsibility and blame in two way dynam
ics between the sexes with double bind of victim blaming accusations. Increase animosity. Increase abusive behaviors of both genders. Ouroboros building up and rolling into the less glamorous _NAME_ Quin and Joker (and beyond). I've always seen _PERSON_ as a peacock or a self-obsessed puppet that struts around masking the psychopaths who are actually in charge in the background. His attention-whore, con-man stuff instead of apologizing is when his mask starts to light up and do eye catching tricks. Maybe I misunderstood your point and you meant the mask of diplomacy, appropriateness and how they're supposed to pretend to be in the public eye? Children learning to lie is natural; cheating is bad; stealing from the rich is excusable 110% agree on the ""called on it"" part. What do you think that will look like? How are you defining aristocrats as a good breed? What about them was not up to their values? How are you defining religious values? ""Love thy neighbor"" style? Or ""do what you're told"" style? How do 
you differentiate between a primate and a human? Can't say that's a bad thing; contraceptives do seem to enable women to go further in their lives and improve their SES than if they get knocked up right away - which they do have a habit of doing when they don't have easy access to contraceptives or know how to use them properly. If there was a good standard of judgment, it would be neat if all people could be sterilized immediately and undergo training and testing before given back their rights to fertility. I'm certain they'd use the wrong criteria (at least as far as my idealistic values are concerned) though. ""Religion was thought to be life denying"" because you had to ""do the right thing"" like not having sex in The Lovers card or...? I remember learning that they did IQ tests with immigrants who'd be just off the boat and didn't speak English and decide they were idiots. So do you think they decreased psychopaths by doing so? I thought they were usually quite intelligent No, I didn't realize that unti
l you stated it. I'm not sure why I didn't because it makes sense. Wasn't that religion though? ^ You're ""undeserving"" and ""immoral"" if you don't work? High school to prison pipeline I've always understood humanists to be against that - or at least most think they are. I'm very against people not really having a chance from the get go. So that's what you mean by violence not in the open, I'm assuming Really? Would you tolerate being a ""slave""? Both ""master"" and ""slave"" sound like extremely undesirable positions. ""Master"" would be 97% undesirable, and since people are thoroughly untrustworthy, ""slave"" would be 99% undesirable. It's a major challenge to be authentic in society. You're right though, a lot of people don't appreciate it! It's not really a concern when you see people for the scum most of them are anyways - then you don't want to be around the general public either. However, people who struggle do very well with authenticity when it comes to being worked with. It often makes it easier 
for them to develop rapport and feel safe/supported enough to get honest with themselves, and as a result, start looking at how to help themselves. God/spirituality would be my first value. Fairly soon after, comes my value for freedom and authenticity My line of thinking with this was I noticed severely traumatized kids (be it generalized high risk or conduct disorders / sociopathic behaviors) better if they allow you to teach them how to question. Trying to prevent them from asking or challenging makes the behaviors worst. Respecting their challenges to authority by providing as much information as possible relatable to them (and in all directions without moralizing) allows them to feel in control enough to occasionally allow you to tell them what to look for when they challenging authority and even ""play the tape through"" when it comes to behaving in harmful to themselves (or others) ways. You're right, it doesn't change morality, but it's the best chance at decreasing repercussions and even circumventin
g ways of coping, acting and living before a personality type gets solidified. Others add it to their tool belt to take advantage, but it's still worth it if it gives at least some of them a chance, before things like corrections systems, death, addiction, etc. get them. Free sex as in without commitment of a relationship or as in not paying for prostitutes? I think getting caught paying for / taking money for sex is where the consequences are these days I agree that's not how it works, but most who end up in front of judges are set up to fail from before kindergarten and our corrections systems are an absolute joke. Double Bind Oh they don't - but they're not happy either. Maybe you've been exposed to competent authority. In this exact moment, my mind goes directly to the psychology professor who taught her students that attachment theories are ""mother blaming"" and invalid. Attachment theories are still recognized as valid by other professionals (including the psychology teacher I've mentioned in this curr
ent reply). A feminist who taught her opinion as fact rather than curriculum as an authority figure. That type of thing is not uncommon in my experience which is why I was asking you about it. You seem to feel strongly the opposite. This specific topic, matters a lot to me. One reason being that when you look at something like reactive attachment disorder at it's extremes, you often get early onset conduct disorders with callous unemotional traits. If you don't tie it in to something like trauma, the child gets written off as a ""bad seed"" or inherently ""evil"" Tie it with something like reactive attachment and at least there is a sliver of a chance they'll try to work with the kid instead of writing them off and tossing them into the prison system (or let them get themselves killed) as soon possible. I'm not even saying the causes are necessarily a result of injured attachments or trauma; just that it's the only door available to have a chance at accessing help - at least in low SES Do you trust them? I ha
ven't seen that - maybe elementary and high schools. The point of education for me is to learn what's on the curriculum. As I said, I also need it to not include ""tragedy porn"" as you called it but I'm assuming that's a what works for many, fails some: where I'm S.O.L. I like learning what I'm supposed to. There's a bit of a double standard with people in lower positions. They aren't allowed to make mistakes while those who are in authority are. If I make a mistake, it's wrong and I'm accountable, but if an authority like a professor or someone makes a mistake, rules are bent and I'm unreasonable or cocky if I want to hold them accountable to the level I am. Sex trade workers that are targeted by serial killers (and violence in general) dont do it because they want to be free - they usually don't know freedom even exists anymore. They're so far underground and buried by chains, they don't even make it onto The Devil card. ^ I understand that it is hard for most people to get or value them though. Same with 
addicts and the homeless. I know most people believe they should be allowed to die off. But as far as I'm concerned, to give them a shot at survival, a chance to have a future, decriminalization enough to screen ""johns"" is important - and it would probably good to look at regular STD checks and stuff for the workers too. Public health concern. There are other types of individuals that deserve genocide than the vulnerable, and people who make it out of the pits of hell, have much more to offer than those who come off pedestals. Humanists advocate it and try to make selling yourself look like a healthy viable option. ^ I assumed it was good intentioned niavetee because many so-called ""activists"" haven't had any ""front line"" experience working with individuals like sex trade workers, so I assumed they didn't know enough about how that life actually looks up close or that most (female and male prostitutes) end up absolutely hating sex, hating men and unable to form relationships even if they leave the trade
. Escorting tends to be a different story in those regards. My issue isn't at all with decriminalization; my issue is activists pretending that it should be embraced - rather than addressing the underlying issues the majority of survival sex trade workers have. On a tangent, it sounds interesting that somewhere in Europe funds disabled individuals to pay for escorts a certain amount of times a year - haven't fact checked it, but it's a neat idea. And then sell tickets for it Bedlam style Scary, fake battle Makes sense. Maybe. I just see people get excited and ""dive in"" as soon as the really heavy stuff is pulled out, but maybe they find it easy/enjoyable to handle because they don't experience it more than at a surface level. I liked that the spider (or spiderman) was the hero, but I didn't fully understand the interplay between the characters. The rat guy somehow reminded me of _PERSON_ (very vaguely remember that character when I saw a couple of the Lord of Rings movies when they came out) Remember you're 
dealing with an arachnid, our brains are quite simple. I risk getting disoriented easily This is more at my skill level and it explains why I have such a bond with alligators (or crocodiles I guess) ^ http://imgur.com/a/PuwYLxi"

I could have gotten up but I feel like every day is the same and I'm a bit depressed - I'll try to read a bit of that book today about search for meaning. 40 minutes after I took the Vyvanse, I was able to move more freely - It's like my thoughts are disconnected from the rest of my body when I'm not on Vyvanse and it's way too comfortable to just stay in bed. I just drank a coffee because I think I'm getting a bit of caffeine withdrawal (I drink a really strong cup every afternoon but haven't been for a few days) - Started feeling weak with an uncomfortable form of headache or brain fog. Tomorrow I see my doctor about the scar tissue on my shoulders and what I should do about the Invega injections. Then I'm going to talk about how the diazepam taper worked until I started taking an alprazolam almost every evening. I'm going to tell him about my weed induced depersonalization and derealization panic attack I had where I took 1mg of alprazolam and went to sl
eep. I'll just need diazepam but to take AS NEEDED this time and not every night. 5mg of diazepam works for me as good as 0.5mg of alprazolam. I don't want to have benzo brain - Lacking memory and such. I have enough cognitive issues as it is."

175963908,"Finally talked to the doctor. He wants me to increase Prozac to 80mg once a day and the buspar to 10mg twice a day. My biggest complaint today was the agitation level I am feeling, maybe frustration. I'm not sure what feeling exactly. Of course, you know how am I about medicines. I'm dreading this increase. 80 mg is the max dose of Prozac. I'm not having end of world panic attacks. So I think it's working for that, but I don't know if it's working for the other things. He thinks I just need to relax and let whatever is bothering me go. Idk what exactly is bothering me. The sound of someone swallowing. A neighbor driving passed with the radio blaring. Covid. Elections. Riots. Idk exactly what's bothering me. Any time things don't go the way I WANT OR EXPECT it to go, I feel like there is a volcano of rage growing suddenly inside of me. I can go from perfectly content to angry crying sobbing yelling in seconds, just over someone doing something I don't like or approve of. I know I have control issues
. Is me seeking medication relief the lazy way out of this? Should I be more dependent on ME controlling my brain? I asked the Dr and he said the medication increase will be so people don't think if me as a cranky person that needs to be avoided. What?!? What kind of answer is that?!? I don't understand. I don't even understand myself lately, I guess. But that's the most recent update, follow up appointment in a couple weeks.

Even if your anxiety isn't often, 2mg is an overkill - If the anxiety is often, the overkill is a waste of precious GABA receptor intolernace. Psychiatry has no knowledge of harm reduction in using meds and addiction centres have no knowledge about it either (Because people are going to use drugs no matter what - Nothing is 100% safe). The less you take and the less often you take, the better. When tolerant, taper off slowly just like with any drug."

With his schizoaffective he heard the random voices, and I'm assuming had other symptoms, I'm not exactly sure.

175963983,"This is a common symptom for people with severe, chronic anxiety/fatigue/insomnia. It sounds like it might be a ""visual aura"" (also called visual migraine), which definitely plays games with your vision (i.e., cause optical illusions that aren't there or the result of eye disease) but, thankfully, is very brief in duration. Many people race to the doctor and end up getting ""normal"" vision exams/MRIs, reassuring that eye diseases or stroke aren't the causes. Visual migraines are often painless, but a slight headache can also precede or follow it. Thankfully, it's only happened to me 3 times before in life--usually when I had a previous bad night's sleep or bad/stressful day. At first I freaked out, raced to the eye doctor. Now I know if I get it, if I just lay down for a few minutes, close my eyes, and rest, it will be gone in a few seconds.

A blessing because I was able to provide my sons with a steady home and life without the help of their dad. I’m divorced and my ex husband is actually married to a man now. The reason also for the divorce. I am thankful that losing my home etc didn’t occur until my youngest graduated high school. He had to leave college in his junior year because the flood of 16 took our 2nd home and his car and the car he got was a financial nightmare and he had to drop for that reason and financial. Now unable to work, I’m not able to meet my needs financially since also losing place to live and what I earned by helping my friend with her dad who died after I was attacked. An ‘accident’ of hospice who stopped feeding him or giving him fluids and he passed away tho they tried to bring him out of it when my best friend 
realized they were doing that. I can’t even afford cable television to help distract me a little. The mental pain I feel is extremely hard to live with. I just try to make it through each day knowing I can end this pain is all that makes it tolerable. Bird watching just isn’t going to do it for me. I know myself well. I got thru so many struggles. Abuse that started when I was 2. I was so different before and nothing would keep me down. I’m tired and there is no way I can trust anything or anyone again. Whatever ur thots are on what that makes me, I’ll read them if u want to share them with me. Who knows what can happen until our last breath."

175963995,"Yet again, problems with the house. So not doing with my mom. We didn’t have an argument or anything. She thinks we can’t pay 1400. That’s fine, we probably can’t. So I left it at that. So MAYBE if everything falls in the right places, my dad said we can move on his land. We gotta pay for own septic/water system and electricity hook up tho. Already the electric company said within a certain amount of ft, hookup is free. But we will have to probably pay 6k at the most to pay for septic system. Probably not even that. Maybe 3k. And then I thought just move a mobile home on the property. Cuz a good one new would cost like 80k for a 2k sq ft 4 bdrm/2 bath (for example). Then we wouldn’t have to pay for land or pay rent I don’t think. And the mortgage would be like 300-500 a month. Or so. Which is doable. Fiancé would be a few miles from work. I’d have more job opportunities. He would too. But be back to my old doctors maybe. But I’d keep my therapist through video chat since she does t
hat now. Hm. I don’t think we’d have to pay property taxes either since it’s my dads property but we can chip in, of course. I’d be closer to him. The plot of land has its own address since it’s technically separate, my dad just owns it too and it’s right next to his. Lots of room for the dogs. More privacy.

174353535,"""Saccadic eye movements and their neurological control signals change significantly as the human fatigues. Electronic instrumentation with a band-width extending from DC to 1 kHz enabled the recording of anomalous looking saccadic eye movements that occurred as the subject's physiological state changed. Fatigue can produce: overlapping saccades in which the high-frequency saccadic bursts should show large pauses; glissades in which the high-frequency bursts should be much shorter than appropriate for the size of the intended saccades; and low-velocity, long-duration, non-Main Sequence saccades in which the motoneuronal bursts should be of lower frequency and longer duration than normal. As few as 30 saccades of 50 deg magnitude or a longer sequence of saccades as small as 10 deg can produce these aberrant eye movements and their concomitant neuronal firing pattern variations. The effects of fatigue could explain some of the variations between and spread within published data for velocity vs amplit
ude of human saccadic eye movements. Measuring the resistance to eye movement fatigue could become either a common clinical tool for diagnosing specific or general disease states, or a research tool for studying dyslexia or fatigue."" So I'm fatigued when it happens? Well duh. It happened when Vyvanse wore off.. But there's also a lot of psychological issues too like lack of focus - And people with ADHD tend to have these movements, analysis suppression, etc.. Ah nvm I'll come back to this later. I'm gonna talk to my doctor and an optometrist because it's not normal to be re-focusing 50 times a second during a panic attack no? More on this; ""The discriminant analysis resulted in three eye movement measures; the scanpath length during the free viewing test, the horizontal position gain during the fast _PERSON_ paradigm of the smooth pursuit test, and the duration of fixations during the far distractor paradigm of the fixation stability test. An integrated score using these variables can distinguish patients w
ith schizophrenia from healthy controls with 82% accuracy."" ""Eye movements reveal a dissociation between memory encoding and retrieval in adults with autism"""

175964029,"I agree. We learn behaviour based on reward. People are rewarded for their close relationships by reciprocation, which starts at day one as a baby. If someone hasn't had that reciprocation, then they have no in-built desire to repeat the behaviour because they've not been conditioned to expect a reward. It can be learned later, but it's much harder. People say it's about trust, but it's not trust; it's familiar expectation."

175964048,Hi Welcome to the forum. Lexapro is a good medication it's the strongest of the SSRI medications and is very activating so it's best to take it first thing in the morning. 10mg is the target dose for anxiety disorders and it can take between 6-8 weeks to fully kick in and the first few weeks can be rough whilst you are getting used to the medication. Any start up side effects usually settle within a couple of weeks so stick with it and you should see some improvements. I used to take it and found it really effective on both anxiety and depression and I did not get many side effects so I hope it works well for you so keep us posted. It's important to remember that antidepressants will not cure you they will only help ease your symptoms so it's important to combine them with self help we have some good links in our resources section so take a look. I would also speak with your doctor about getting a referral for talking therapy such as CBT as this is very effective probably more so than medication. I 
am pleased you have found us you will find good support here from others who can relate to what you are going through. _PERSON_.

174353591,"16-30 are when symptoms usually develop. My negative symptoms (Anhedonia, apathy, lack of motivation) started when I was 12 and positive symptoms (Including hearing voices, delusions, paranoia) started when I was 16. The most common percentage of cases that otherwise happen aren't childhood schizophrenia (Because that's very rare) but instead, after age 30. Diagnoses overlap each other so if your symptoms are interfering with your life to the point where you can't function, you should see a psychiatrist who will monitor you for a few months to a year or more to make the correct decisions of med treatment. It's important to see a psychologist/therapist and make sure you're eating right, exercising, have a good quality of life with support, meaning, a good environment, etc.."

174353603,"If you were on the previous dose of Wellbutrin for a short time, it would make sense that you would get anxiety from the new dose of Wellbutrin. What you should have done was drank 1-3 drinks of coffee every day for a month and then when you increased the dose of Wellbutrin, you stop drinking the coffee. Then you'd have no anxiety ^^ Wellbutrin and caffeine are the only stimulants that give me anxiety because they aren't as dopaminergic. I guess dopamine calms me down because I have ADD. My theory of having serotonin type of schizophrenia instead of dopamine makes much more sense to be because of the pervasive developmental disorder NOS making me obsessed with psychedelics. Psychedelics gave me psychosis when NEVER, ever has a dopaminergic stimulant ever given me psychosis. Even in high doses.. Except MDMA (Which is a serotonin stimulant!)"

175964060,"Depends on the situation and level of apathy on a given day. I think I have a high tolerance to situations that may provoke others. But if I am triggered by something or other, it can be explosive. I think I have different triggers to others. It is difficult to assess. Perhaps being explosive = problem with expression. I am not sure what psych literature means when it says ''people with schizoid personality disorder may have an especially hard time expressing anger. Even when directly provoked, someone with schizoid personality disorder might react very coolly, belying what they may be feeling underneath'. Considering the expression of anger is frowned upon in society, I feel sure many people fail to express it in the way they would like to."

175964067,"I have, for as long as I can remember, been able to explain how I feel. I was told I had good insight. Even when talking about other people that I know, I show insight. I have bpd. And am very empathetic. I feel others feelings... before even they do at times. I may even understand why I feel the way I feel. But what is most rare is having any solution to my problems... for ex: what can I do so I no longer feel that way? Some I know the answers to, but many I have no clue. Like how can I treat bpd by myself? That seems impossible to grasp. But how will I be able to deal with the loss and trauma in my head? I am pretty sure that someone has to help me with that. Someone that will bring me back every time I dissociate or distract myself. It's just a desperate attempt to avoid any feeling that is related to that memory. In therapy tho, if asked how I feel about a particular loss, I am unable to feel and draw on that memory at the same time. The reason being I'll automatically distract myself, or I hav
e to be talked into feeling the pain or either talking about the pain that goes with that memory of a loss or trauma. I know what I'm trying to say!!

175964069,"_USER_ID_: It sounds as if you've got your wits about you since you're questioning your marriage. That's more than I've seen from a lot of people who post here with similar questions. However it seems that, in your situation, both of you have a lot of your cards on the table. Understanding each other and being honest will make whatever you and he are destined for a lot easier on you, emotionally speaking. There doesn't seem to be anything to do at this point than to compromise. If he agreed to therapy would that be enough for you? Therapy can do only so much for a schizoid, or any personality disordered person. You both run the risk of reaching some kind of breaking point. Is it worth it to you? Is he a one-in-a-million type of guy? I'll stop here because I can't possibly even pretend to be able to put myself in your shoes and I don't want to steer you wrong. Reading on may help... I've always believed that love makes people a little ignorant and blind to what they don't want to see. Of course this 
can work the opposite way; being overly paranoid and clingy due to insecurity, but in this case, that kind of clingy paranoia tends to define the problems in a relationship. Histrionic behavior always overshadows the kind of schizoid apathy/avoidance we are discussing here. Anyway, the ignorance I was talking about above also extends to all the facets of a relationship that lead to love. Courtship, for example. The empath has an innate need for romantic companionship, so he or she will unconsciously overlook the little signs that their schizoid partner is not as enthusiastic. (""diminish some details"" as _USER_ID_ put it) This is how I got away with it. They make it easy. I can't speak for the people who have in the past claim to have fallen in love with me, but I suspect there has been a sort of blind hopefulness and a will to control: ""He'll come around"", or more simply put in pop music terms: ""I will make him love me."" So how do they express this? By being accommodating. By letting me dictate the term
s of our time spent together. By giving me gifts. I figure if I'm already involved in some kind of courtship, why not go ""full-on shallow"" and try to manipulate more out of them? It's like: damn! this relationship shlt is so easy! I just stand here and get complimented and people buy me dinner! This is not to say there was never any neediness on my part; no matter how secure I am in the belief of my emotional unavailability, there is always the belief that maybe this time will be different. Being treated well further clouded my judgement. But all of this falls apart the minute that ridiculous four letter L-word is first mentioned. It's as if it's some sacred incantation. Once it's said, any non-compliance on my part suddenly makes me the bad guy. The heartless one. I am accused of letting them on. By this time, it does me no good to remind them that they blithely ignored all the warning signs: my emotional aloofness, resisting eye contact, never instigating any kind of non-sexual affection. And sex makes it 
all the more complicated. To me, the sex was good because they were basically just another trick I could tolerate outside of bed. To them, the sex was my way of communicating the emotion I couldn't express verbally. By this point, the whole thing is a great big ugly confusing mess. It implodes. The end. I watch TV alone on my couch while they sit home and cry in the dark. I do feel guilty, but only in a cognitive sense. I have no choice. It sucks."

I always see it as a parallel to my inability to ""see in 3D"" (stereoscopic vision). It's a subtle thing, and it can go unnoticed for a long time, but it can have deeper implications, and ultimately it's a sense that I just don't have. Going to a social gathering is like going to a screening of a 3D movie. The whole purpose of the activity is lost on me, all I get from it is the higher ticket price and the inconvenience of the (allegedly-3D) glasses I have to wear and the uncomfortably dim and/or doubled image on the screen.

And everything we write has to be like very professional. Its due to that we turn in our reports to the state I believe. Maybe not everything, but most, especially the program I'm in, because it's a pilot program. And I just, idk, the being uber professional thing is so incredibly tiring. I just wanna talk to someone like a person, not like a therapist. We have to use certain terms and stuff. Like I want to say ""I wanna help you do more stuff that you want to d
o in life"" eh, but I gotta say ""I want to help you achieve what you would enjoy doing on a daily basis, and i can do that by active listening, and modeling appropriate communication."" On paper, anyway, I have to say that."
175964107,I sent my coworker a notebook that is personalized and has personalized scriptures along the bottoms of the pages for Christmas. Apparently she just got it and she said she is almost in tears. It's just what she needed. It's nice making someone happy for Christmas!

175964109,"As a narcissist, I have been in schizoid mode for a very long time now. I even received a dream about it once. In the dream, I was the emperor of Rome but people turned against me. They insulted me and tried to kill me. So I hid in the gutters and subsisted by eating dumplings stashed in my ass (I know right?). I was able to survive in the gutters but had no real power. It's interesting to see the schizoid way of living. There is almost no connection with people and the outside world. You might as well be dead for all intents and purposes. Question is, how often do you people eat from your own ass? What type of food do you stash?"

175964112,"My doctor said because I have ongoing psychotic symptoms, as I said earlier I don’t talk about them on here. I talk about them with my sister and my therapist, doctor and people in my real life but not on here because I feel like it’s personal and I don’t want people in my real life to find me on here. I’m also suicidal a lot. And I’ve been on almost every AP and things aren’t getting better they’re starting to get worse the past two or three months. I know because I don’t post about being suicidal constantly or about my hallucinations and stuff all the time that may seem like I’m stable but I’ve been struggling a lot and I don’t feel comfortable writing some of the things I deal with on here. Plus I ended up in hospital last month for psychotic symptoms and I keep having experiences (again, don't feel comfortable talking about them specifically here) but that I keep almost ending up in the hospital again"

Hopefully if I vape 12mg 4x a day I won't need the stick. But I have to try a different tank. Maybe the zenith pro because I've got to have better air flow. The staff notice me staying in from the smoking breaks and they're going to catch on if I keep it up. The phones went down today, in the whole place, except for cell phones. Looks like I'll have to probably quit my night time yogurt. It's too full of calories. No reason to have yogurt and candy. I want a peppermint mocha lol. Good thing I can't go to any coffee places."

175964122,"Idk what’s wrong with me I keep feel like I’m disconnecting from reality and on the verge of psychosis. I’m scared I’ll end up in the hospital. Maybe it’s just from missing my meds yesterday then starting them back today. Or too much coffee. Or the cough medicine, not really sure"
175964123,"Morning I’m gonna try to get out and go for a little walk today. I’m sure I’ll fall asleep soon after my meds but I’m gonna try to walk anyway. I wrote an open letter to my mom an hour ago. But I will never send it. I need to write something else too for my blog but idk what to write. I’m not starting school til October. So that sucks. But maybe for the best idk. Who knows. Feeling sad past few days. More like lonely. I feel so incredibly alone lately. Still dealing with a low grade depression.

175964130,"Both my parents were the first to college in their families. My dad was dirt-poor oil field trash from West Texas. But he was smart and put himself through college and UT med school. Both he and my mom were voracious readers and we all read a ton. And although I ultimately I was lucky to go to some fantastic schools because of them, dad taught me early that the same books people at Yale read are available in almost any library. Anyone can be educated, all you have to do is read. You don't have to go to Stanford. By far, the two most talented surgeons I ever had the honor of operating with were graduates of the University of Mississipi and the Univerity of _NAME_. They were in their own leagues compared to anyone at Harvard or Vanderbilt. So... Where I went to undergrad, we were required to take music and art history and philosophy and Greek and English lit, no matter if you were an engineer or what. Now, most of the other Ivies have that same requirement. I think it is a good idea, so folks can be 
introduced to a broad piece of our cultural heritge."

175964132,"There are things I feel like doing or things that I want in my life (sometimes they're immediate, sometimes they're actually long-term things), but ""dreams, properly"", I'm not sure if I have any. I get tired very quickly of the idea of something I can't do anything about right now . That's probably a big part of why I keep coming back to the idea of traveling. I can always improve my language skills, my self-sufficiency skills or my health and fitness. And it doesn't matter if I actually get to use those skills the way I pictured in my head, they're useful no matter what, and they give me structure (or some structure at least). I only need to get to that end point (of actually going on a trip) often enough in my life to be convinced that it's something in the plane of reality."

175964140,"Hi, I’m so sorry this is happening, that sounds like it could be very scary. I don’t have any personal experience with this, but I know that sometimes people can be on a medication that’s helping for a while but then it stops working as well. I have only heard this. I have bipolar but I’m still trying to find medications that work well for me. Anyways, I think your best bet is to talk to your psychiatrist about what’s happening as soon as you can. In terms of isolating yourself from your loved ones, what are the pros and cons of spending time with them right now? Do you think that your boyfriend or maybe a trusted friend would be able to even just sit with you while you do separate things? I know at least when I’m struggling it’s helpful to be around someone even if we’re not engaging with one another. And maybe the more you spend time with them the more comfortable you’ll get. I hope this helps a bit."
175964141,I feel very slow today. I took 10mg of olanzepine yesterday and 50mg Seroquel last night. That's all on top of my Invega injection. I don't feel like doing anything and I'm not thinking much. Idk if I should get a part time job. I'm thinking of doing some online courses or signing up for a new college course in September.
175964142,Good day actually. A little anxiety but I got through it with ativan and tree meditation (barely). I scheduled an appt for an ultrasound on my uterus for issues I’m having. Called fiancés mom and talked a bit. Got bank stuff worked out. Got couple bills paid. Got my vitamins from my sis in the mail. Very happy for that. Got a nap in. Played with the doggos. No writing or cleaning down as I said I would. Got my uni orientiation on Thursday.
175964143,Whaaat so I talked to my doctor just now and he thinks I might be MANIC like actually manic not hypomanic hence the delusional thinking and paranoia. Diagnosises are so confusing. But hey! I got an upgrade! Hahahaha. Medication adjustment again and I talk to him again next week. He put a rush on the request for me to see a psychiatrist.

175964152,I’m always better when I don’t talk to her. Like on the days I don’t. Breaking out in an anxiety rash now. Whole body itching but that also may be from the caffeine. But I know when I get really anxious my body starts itching like my palms and face and other places. It’s like it feels like I’m super aware of my body right now cuz I feel my nerves jumpin in parts of my body and then it itches there cuz my anxiety is just like idk how to explain. I can have constant anxiety but then I can have anxiety in waves where it’s just like “ugh I’m ok” and then 2 seconds later BOOM anxiety. Then 2 seconds later I’m ok and again and again. When that happens it’s the worst. I can feel my heart racing and my stomach feels like a roller coaster in my body. It’s because I get angry at her and then I’m like anxious and sad. I think this is all being made worse right now by the caffiene and then when she started talking to me about my relationship and me not working I got angry and anxious. 
She’s literally the only person ever in my life that makes me feel this way. My history with my mom has never ever ever been good since as young as I can remember and that’s like since I was 3 years old. I’m a really patient and nice person but it’s like she’s the only person where I can turn angry against quickly. Only person. Ever. I’ve had people wanna beat me up in high school and I didn’t even feel anger towards them. But when you have a parent that is narcissistic and manipulative and gaslights u. You remember it. And it continues to happen. I’m tired of it.
175964153,"I'm lowering the phenibut and not going to take it every day anymore. I just took it every day because there was so many situations in my life where I needed to be happy and social. But now I don't care. People can deal with my moodiness and apathy. They can all go to hell. Phenibut is kind of a nootropic so it helps me focus but idk about memory. I've always had a REALLY good short term memory and a horrible long term memory. I think about only what happens in the current day. I don't think about the previous day. I don't remember what I ate yesterday or what happened really. But with memory games that I did in the psych ward on an ipad when I was preparing for high school math that I didn't do, I was really good at it. My mom asks ""Do you remember *Holiday*?"" and I have no idea. Part of what I don't remember is when I was doing all of those research chemicals. I brough them with me on holidays. I was with my sisters friend and I don't even know who she is or her name. That's why I started a mem
ory journal so I can look back on what happened on each day. It will work for now. I'm just mentally active and trying to do so many things that I'm exhausting myself. I don't know what to do - No one is guiding me. I have to do this all by myself. I put so much pressure on myself - Immense pressure. I said that in 10 years, I'll be successful. I can't slack off and play video games. I feel like I'm running out of time and my cognition is ****. Sometimes I just stare at an article on the computer for 5 minutes and just think about things.. Every new page that I read on the computer, I bookmark it and go to a new tab out of 20-30 tabs until my computer shuts down and I start it up again, recover all the tabs and then close them. I have so many bookmarks but never read them."

175964158,"I've been in jobs where I was the subhuman that had to do exactly as they say. Once I was late for work (I was an apprentice welder) and the boss said ""If you're late again, you're fired"". I didn't really understand that because what about legit/valid excuses? Didn't matter. I remember being late for class in high school and she said ""Why are you late?"" and I said ""I was getting a drink of water"". I didn't get it at the time. I literally didn't understand. At my second last job in retail, I felt guilty about having to use the washroom. I also tried to be exactly on time when I was outside vaping. I'd be constantly looking at the time on my phone and leave exactly at x time. I remember I had to use a jackhammer in 100 degree heat, sweat pouring off my face onto concrete, power washing oil sand vacuum tanks (I was 16) and everyone else was getting paid 40 dollars an hour. I asked my boss if I could increase my salary from 11 to 12 dollars and hour and he said ""ask the manager"" so I asked him 
and he said ""ask your boss"" so nothing really happened. It was a billion dollar company. If I had to go to the doctor, I had to plan in advance and call employees ""Can you fill in for me at x time?"" - Calling a bunch of numbers and some people didn't give a **** really. It was ""team work"" and employees were talking about how the company makes them work Christmas day, New Years, etc... My mom has cancer, heart conditions - Never had time off in two years. She's thinking of quitting. The hotel can't live without her though. It's all madness. I regret working as a teenager sometimes 16 hours in a day and my days off was to go fishing with my ex step dad who I hated. I felt terrible when he said ""If I win the lottery, we'll be fishing all the time"" and in my head I was like ""Pls ****ing kill me"" - Then he won the lottery and has a fishing business but he's getting sued for stealing and copy write etc."

175964160,"I don't crave the types of relationships that actually exist. I crave the unattainable ideal of a relationship where I won't constantly have to _USER_ID_ what I say because the first 12 thoughts that run through my head would take too long to explain. Human beings, when they're trying to create intimacy, often fall back on what is almost universal, things like -- enjoying your family and, you know, doing things together. And ...bless them... they try so hard, but it's like trying to squeeze blood from a rock. And then I have volumes of thoughts on whatever obscure thing I'm currently into but no one has heard of. I guess it's a type of existential loneliness, the idea that the things that you think about are things that no one else is thinking about, and the things that everyone thinks about are things you never think about."

175964162,"_NAME_ I have depression and adhd I apologize for not listing my current conditions it has created much confusion in this thread. theHTreturns I’m doing well on the list of meds she has me on. My question is; could I have had a manic episode due to the removal of EffexorER/adding Seroquel, Wellbutrin and Ativan all at once at such a fast pace in a very short time. And if that’s possible is it fair that this Dr now claims I’m bipolar? I am confused by the diagnosis as I’ve never spent money in excess, had nights without sleep, talked excessively, been promiscuous or shown any of the key indicator symptoms of the disease. The only extreme thing I did is lose my reasoning in regards to handling life (as I usually/normally did) by exploding at the Dr for taking me off EffexorER too quickly. Still, she believes that she can reduce my dosage by 37.5 increments and I will be fine....I’m here to tell you that I’m petrified to even consider that idea. Can a person have on manic episode induced b

175964163,"One of my very intelligent, very educated family members once said to me “people who have started doing better won’t as often go to post on those online forums “ This is a wonderful place to post and for people to connect! However, it is true that once treatment has started to really work and you have begun to feel better .... you are less attracted to post on these forums. I say this, because I want to communicate that people who have become better may not come here to share that they’ve greatly improved. Sometime these forums can seem like only bad news from folks. Important news none the less! I don’t mean to say this forum is not wonderfully valuable. What I want to communicate, though, is that you also can become better and you can get offline. Relief from this monster called anxiety and panic is possible! I am posting here again for the first time in about two years. I don’t know what _NAME_ me here tonight, but this form was a place I frequented weekly years ago. I was so despera
te for answers. So desperate to know that someone beat it..... I am a thirtysomething-year-old guy. Out of nowhere I began to suffer from panic attacks and very bad anxiety. It seemed to rule my life and it was incredibly upsetting how often I would have dramatic instances of high anxiety. I thought that my life would forever more be ruled by panic and anxiety moments. I was crushed inside thinking my life was forever darkened by this. My doctor prescribed me Prozac and also time released Xanax. I take them at night. 2 years in ..... I am 80% better! This isn’t to say that I don’t have moments of anxiety. Especially, health related anxiety. I also have anxiety when I travel away from the state I live in long distances. However, I push myself to do these things because I know the discomfort is important to feel and that once I get to where I am going I will realize that absolutely nothing what actually happened to me that I may have anxiety about . I talk to myself and say “NO you are totally ok” , bec
ause that really is the truth of the matter. When you know panic and anxiety cannot do any harm to you, you begin to control it — not it control you. I simply wanted to come back here to encourage you (and myself) to keep seeking to get better. I remember as a new anxiety sufferer that I was so hopeless. There is no reason to feel that. This can ENORMOUSLY improve. Please know that."

175964165,"I have this exact thing it's weird! I have eaten 5 meals total in 5 months but I do live on Soylent and Odwalla Protein shakes. I'm afraid of choking because of the Globus feeling so I avoid it. It's the worst thing ever. I hate it, makes me feel down like I'm missing life because of this. On a positive note I've lost 40+ pounds and I needed to! After all my searching I've realized that Pepsin from LPR is irritating my throat causing Globus. I also know full well that my anxiety makes it worse. I get fear that my throat is just going to close all of a sudden and I'll suffocate. So I ordered Gaviscon Advance from Amazon. Takes a while to get to the United States but oh well. I also started drinking 365 Alkaline Water 9.5 PH since it was shown in a scientific study to inactivate any Pepsin in your throat. Sometimes it's certainly worse than other times. But it's always extremely troubling when I concentrate on it. I know it's hard not to with the darn feeling going on but anxiety does make it worse. 
Globus has changed my life, in a way I wanted to get control over my bad eating habits and it certainly has! But I miss eating food - any food but I can now live without all the nasty fattening stuff. I just want to eat some tasty lentils without fear of choking to death. I haven't given up hope."

I even hate going to actually use the toilet. I absolutely HATE filthy bathrooms. I hate drying off after the shower next to the toilet. I fckn hate that the toilet is so close to my legs when I shower. And god forbid if it touches any part of my body while I'm trying off, I'll have a fit. Maybe throw up. I change my bathroom mats regularly. Like buy new ones. When I clean the bathroom I douse it in lysol. The whole toilet, sink, shower. I cleaned the toilet recently and I scrubbed the whole thing. Even the sides. It caused me so much anxiety. This has been going on for a very long time. Even since I was a teen. I even stopped taking baths when I was about 9 or 10. I felt like sitting in the tub was extremely filthy and that s

My psychiatrist is trying to rule out a mood disorder as I have had some recent emotional episodes (I’ve never experienced mania or psychosis tho) so it may be something other than bipolar. Once I am fully off Lexapro if the emotional episodes begin again she wants to try Lamictal. I will ask about Lithium. My main source of consternation is the panic symptoms and anxiety and Klonopin helps for the most part but would love to find something that is not a benzo. If Klonopin is my only option left, I will go with it because it’s really all that’s helped me so far.

175964184,Doing pretty well this morning. I am switching psychiatrists for sure. My psychiatrist (current) won't even return my calls anymore. So unprofessional. I called him on Monday and yesterday and he returned neither call. I am just sick of our relationship (between me and psychiatrist) being like pulling teeth.
175964185,Fingers crossed you’ll be ok....
175964186,We are going to put it up on Thanksgiving.....
175964187,I am quite happy the surgery is over with. I waited almost three months because of covid. The burning and bladder pain are still with me. This whole year has seemed quite strange to me. We are already into June so we will be half way through the year soon. I have never seen a thing like all this. I want this virus to be gone and people to be able to enjoy their lives again. Summer is here and no one seems to be enjoying themselves. I pray things will change for the better soon. God bless you all
175964188,"I asked about my blood test to see what my sugar levels were. They were normal but I have slightly high bilirubin? The test was from 6 months ago when I was in the hospital for panic attacks so I'm getting another blood test. I'm not taking phenibut anymore which could be the problem so maybe it would resolve. I noticed that I had jaundice symptoms since I was a teenager. I was really skinny and not eating cuz of the stimulants and I was more yellow. ""_NAME_ syndrome (GS) is a mild liver disorder in which the liver does not properly process bilirubin. Many people never have symptoms. Occasionally a slight yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes may occur. Other possible symptoms include feeling tired, weakness, and abdominal pain."" ^ I think that's what it might be. I asked my mom two days ago to take a look at my eyes to see that they're slightly yellow but she didn't notice. Freaking out slightly but I'll just wait for the test."

Thy might add something like that but really a standard MD will be at a loss with bp1....supposedly the average bp1 patient is on six different meds so it takes a pdoc to figure it out but they should get you in much sooner.
175964195,"That was just an example I made about the things. But yea everyone has their reasons. I just say that way because many people that I talked to who are atheists seem to say they are that way because of that, what I said. But no, yea I consider myself pretty darn fact based too. I don’t goto church or anything. Holidays maybe. But I stopped going to church when I was pretty much bullied there as a child and young adult. Hm, yea, fiancé doesn’t believe either. He says he believes science, but he doesn’t know much about science in THAT way or even science in general...but his approach is to just be kind to everyone and obey the golden rule of respect in life. I can say honestly tho, he’s not kind to everyone lol. He says he would never talk to anyone that’s just on the street or passing him by, or anything similar like smile, etc. there can be some times when he’s not respectful either but he does say sorry most times. My point is, I’m similar in his belief. But it doesn’t matter if it
’s someone passing me on the street or passing me by at work or chatting me up. Like I always say something or at least smile. Which I think has also helped me get more friends/acquaintances, and meet interesting people. _PERSON_ is super happy where he’s at in life. I am, generally, but I always look for new things, people, experiences, etc. I wasn’t this way before, but I had to teach myself to be. Because I use to had people, soooooooooo many people say I just look at the ground. Well yea I’m shy and have social anxiety. Still do, but now I try to step outside of my comfort zone. I’m getting off track, but my point is, I had to see what god was doing in my life from a different perspective than what I was taught. I guess you could say I’m some sort of alternative Christian or whatever. Not really tho. I really really really like Christian philosophy and Christian apologetics tho. I don’t believe in other religions, But I read about them all the time and adapt the, IMO, positive things from th
em, like Buddhism. Etc."

175964210,I had an episode where I was going to go to the hospital a few weeks ago. What helped was calling the on-call psychiatrist and she made some quick changes in my meds and just going to bed early one night. I understand how hard it can be though when feeling like that. Is there anything you can do to distract yourself or soothe yourself? Hope that might help. There is also a service called Samaritans.org where you can email someone if you're having thoughts of self-harm. They are confidential and I've used it before. I hope that helps.

My doc said I could go down on Zyprexa and that's helping me a lot. I feel much more activated -- whatever that means. I think it means that I have more energy. All I know is psychosis screwed me up really bad and now I am getting better from it. It's hard work.
175964228,"Psychedelics and life (Life is a trip) are the source of spirituality. Spirituality can also be a source of religions. Religion is like following the messenger and spirituality is like following the message. I used to be an atheist since I was born basically and was very interested in science. Then I did lots of psilacetin. Psychedelics just usually increase a theists faith in God but for me, I became a pantheist/panentheist (Like spiced up atheism). Theists connect with the true God which I can't connect with because of my convictions about hating how I always had to stand up and kneel in church (Hurting my knees) and having to pray the same thing 10 times - Also the fact that everything has a ""physical"" reason based in reality as to why it happens. I like to think about ""metaphysical"" things for fun. When you focus on your breath and in between each breath, there's a pause.. That pause from in-out or out-in, is universal consciousness (The singularity) - The highest of all consciousness.. The 
light spectrum.. Infinity of the singularity of a black hole.. Y'know.. when a massive star forms iron at the centre of it's core to stop pushing out against gravity to collapse in on itself and doesn't create a neutron star but instead a black hole? Another universe maybe? Who knows.. We will only know with more advanced science. For some people, atheism starts in high school biology class when the teacher says that they thought God spawned maggots on old food until a scientist realized that it was because of flies landing on the food and laying eggs which turn into maggots and then turn into flies.. I know there's a God.. but there isn't at the same time. Just like how there isn't good or bad, it depends on how you look at it. It's what makes life, LIFE. We're not supposed to know. We get a small glympse with spiritual awakening, psychedelics or altered states of consciousness but then we go back to reality.. You're left with the feeling of ""What happened?"" (Even with psychosis). The ""Paradox"" is God to 
me. It's everything - The universe, yin yang... There's pessimists and optimists.. It's just the way you look at it. That's why there's arguing.. Perspectives.. If you look at both sides, often you can see how one person is right (Or wrong) in one way while the other is wrong (Or right) in the opposite way. Life wouldn't be the same if we knew or knew not. It would be borrrringggg =] I try to be a good person. But I'm also a little evil. The devil (Drugs or bad food for example) can take you to the bad side, so people feel bad about it or good... There would be no art without a lot of good and a little evil or a lot of evil and a little bit of good (Depends on how you look at it). That's why psychedelics can inspire art.. life inspires art.. The trip of life..."

175964250,"Hi, i am 24 from India, 3 days after my 18th birthday i had shifted from my home to another state for my graduation. During me graduation i had friends which i deemed as friends but i dont know if they were my true friends or not as they kind of always treat me inferior to them or pulled my leg for any reason for whatever I say. This went on for 3 years and then after my graduation i shifted to another state for job but again same thing the new people I met behaved same like my friends from college. And due to these kind of behaviour i started cornering myself from any kind of social interaction even with my family members and my relatives. Now i dont have any kind of reason to talk to anyone except being occupied completely in my mobile phone. The most satisfied and calm i am is when I am using my phone and i dont give a damn what is happening around me. It's been 6 years I had talked to anyone for a rolonged period of time and now i face difficulties holding any type of conversation i just want t
o leave from the convo. This is hurting my jobs and my close family relations as well. All I need js my phone nd something to eat all the time and i dont need anything else to survive. I am happy in my own space bubble with my phone and i get extremely upset and agitated when someone takes away my phone. Please help what kind of problem i am facing.

175964254,"Hi Miss_Angel, I was in a relationship with a woman who had suffered the death of a child. She had problems of her own as well and was on meds. She could never seem to get regulated or something else was suspected to be the root cause and she'd see another doctor. I would work to build her up confidence, let her know how much I cared for her and be there for her to listen when she was sad. Just when I would think she was making progress the next time I spoke to her she would be back in the depths of depression and all ground we had gained over weeks had been lost. After a while it became emotionally frustrating to the point I was personally effected by it. I began to lose hope in the relationship, felt like that was nothing I could ever do that would help her get better, she would never change without professional help and finally had to cut ties with her before she pulled me under with her. From what I understand of later events it was a timely move on my part and I dodged a bullet. I know you wan

Weed + schizophrenia = Bad idea.. Although I like to think I don't have this illness.. Maybe I still don't who knows.. Autism = **** cluster of mental problems."
175964277,"I don't know if I would definitively say that I have this as I do not have a diagnosis, but I certainly relate to it. I am unable to visualize most things in my mind; there have been times during which I have been unable to imagine my own face even though I knew what I looked like in general. I also have an elaborate fantasy life, but faces and often even bodies are abstract to the point where I have to spend hours writing their physical characteristics so that I don't forget. I mainly focus on the ""characters'"" personalities and interactions, which is easy for me despite my general inability to visualize their bodies. When I read books, watch movies, dream, or become extremely focused on a lecture or talk, physical characteristics of even pictures or humans right in front of me become equally as abstract. This sounds strange, but I don't notice that it's happening until later when I try to recall anything visual and I can only remember general concepts or occurrences. It can be quite irritating 
at times."
175964278,"My friends birthday is Sunday, we're going out to eat"
175964279,Feel like crap. Woke up with a really bad sore throat
175964280,So I am packing for my trip and I feel okay emotionally but there is a undercurrent of anxiety. I wish I could go right now and get it over with. I keep telling myself it will be a less than 48 hour trip and that I will be on the road back before you know it. I will check in tomorrow before I hit the road.
175964281,I told my mom and she said that I always want to change my meds. It's true. She said to chew one less nicotine gum every day. I'll try doing that. I'm just really scared and sad about everything that has happened in this incarnation.
175964282,"What you write is absolutely true. You have to go through your emotions. If you suppress them they will destroy you. I got the same advice: feel the feeling, don't fight it, you should go through it so it can be released. Allow the release. Because this is how feelings work. They come and then they go. If you suppress the sadness it will devour you from within. So you have to acknowledge it. I was given an advice to start writing a journal about my feelings so that they can be released and so the sadness can flow and go out of me. For months I tried to suppress my sadness and then one day I started crying without a reason, every day. My folks thought I'm just sad and under pressure but we quickly realised I'm having a serious depressive episode. So yeah! Cry when you're sad. Just go home, close the door and cry. It always helps me and I feel that I acknowledge my emotions and I'm stronger for it."
175964283,"Not yet, but I probably will later. Just lounging right now in my jammies since it's Saturday."
175964284,I'm ok now. Still little out of it but I'm ok.
175964285,I got a snickers bar and a cheese danish ?
175964286,Yeah oxytocin is used in hospitals to help with childbirth but it shouldn't be used anyways cuz it can cause harm to the child and the mother.
175964287,"I like the food diary idea too, thanks _PERSON_. I am not good about praising myself. I just feel frustrated with myself and afraid my anxiety will stay high for a long time. I guess I can try that...for a while I was trying to think of things I enjoyed each day before I fell asleep, but between not feeling well and the pandemic, lots of days I enjoyed absolutely nothing. Maybe I should try thinking of the hard things I did that day and how I didn’t give in to the anxiety??? I do drink a carnation instant breakfast if i can’t eat at all, but I try to avoid that due to lots of sugar (not good for my RA inflammation) and also because I have a teenage daughter. I want to model good eating for her too. That’s part of the pressure, I so want to be healthy for myself and her. Thanks for answering, I feel very alone right now."
175964288,"It is true up until the attack and what followed. I still had just enough income to survive and staying with my friend gave me a little support and I wasn’t totally alone. Also sitting with her dad I got 10$ a day to just get by each month. When he died and she kicked me out, I attempted suicide twice and I had no intent to survive. For days in icu only meds kept me alive until I could majntain blood pressure and organs could function. 2nd attempt the hospital called my family because they didn’t think I would survive. That is when the guilt hit me. Unconscious I heard my sons crying for me to live. But later I realized I can’t live. I couldn’t live w pain from the last time so now w my last and best friend for 33 years betrayed our friebdshsjio do hug it. I never would have made those attempts if I thought there was the slightest chance life could be even tolerable. And (MT is like empty- MTinside). Being borderline personality may be why it’s near impossible to make a friend. Losing my 
last close friend it’s now too lonely to want to live snd no hope at all . Im jstill scared and wish I never existed. Its hard to make that move, I put it off because I’m scared and do not want to hurt my sons. . It’s a battle in my mind most of the time now. I try to sleep because Ptsd nightmares are easier than hurting my sons . I see no hope at all. Also my current therapist cancels without notice and 9 of last 10 were cancelled when I need help the most. It’s too late to get help anyway. Not every persons life has a happy ending."

175964290,Thank you btw.
175964291,I'm gonna go take a walk to clear my mind. I'll be back in a better state - Not just because I know - But because I'll decide to. It's like I can decide whichever state to be in.. Just my intuition controls me like I feel vibes from people around me and react to them.. It's like dealing with spirits.
175964292,"Everybody says that caffeine can cause mania. I think that's not true for everyone. In fact, I think caffeine helps me focus like a normal person. Doesn't make me hyper. I drank coffee and am drinking a Monster and I already feel more focused. My sister has ADHD and she used to drink copious amounts of Pepsi to focus before she was diagnosed. I don't feel I have ADHD but like what if I do??"
175964293,"I have been experiencing shortness of breath and a feeling of chest congestion. Also, nausea, dizziness and a feeling of having to force myself to breathe. I am scared, and that adds to my anxiety thinking something is seriously wrong with me."
175964294,"Hi all, I have a very close friend of mine who has experienced some sort of major abuse in her teenage years. Well she is a woman with a strong personality with a successful career as of now. However in the last few months she has had a series of anxiety and panic attacks and was under professional therapy. The therapy initially worked on her depression, however she suddenly goes sad and negative about herself isolating her from us. Initially we gave her some time , however we came to know that she had suicidal tendencies and was in a lot of pain in her isolation. I tried helping her speaking to her and being there for her, however post discussion with her doctor, it seems she is traumatised with her past and is in an advanced stage of depression. She no longer is open for therapy and is full of pain and pity in her head. I have been asking for suggestions and help from doctors, where someone asked me whether she is suffering from PTSD. I am not sure as I do not know the exact symptoms of the same 
nor am I an expert. If anyone can share their expertise on this , please feel free to share. If not me it would definitely help someone out there , especially in the covid 19 crisis situation."

175964299,Possible trigger: We’re all doomed. And the way the world is reacting to this virus is kind of scary. I rather just blow my brains out before demons come after me for my blood. My blood cures death for those who have died. Dead have to stay dead. That way when I’m gone they won’t be able to get it and let be again as banshies in the night. I don’t want to die or self harm. They’re telling me to give them my blood. Sounds reasonable if they leave me the **** alone. I’ve not done that yet. I don’t want to but I feel like I have to.

175964309,"I don't recommend phenibut cuz tolerance builds fast and withdrawal is 10x apathy. I've been tapering down for over 6 months. Most people that take it every day end up taking like 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40g. I taper down to 500mg then take 1300mg twice a week and go back down to 1g then taper back to 500mg. I've been doing that for almost a year. I just can't take as much as regular people because too much makes me feel stupid. Ketamine made me realize that I'd rather be my thoughts than to look at them - I enjoy sadness I've realized. It's ok for me to have apathy and anhedonia as long as I'm not around people to be social. Usually I only take phenibut when I'm going hiking twice a week because everyone around me is always so social and positive. I don't trust anyone else taking phenibut because it's addictive. I wouldn't trust myself taking it before I got anti-addictive effects from a big psilacetin overdose."
175964310,No worries SP!
175964311,"Thing is when you start feeling off like you did last night you need to have things in place that you do the moment that hits.

This is how you stay stable.....it’s not that mood changes don’t start to happen and don’t get me wrong they are real mood changes but they too can be changed, nipped in the bud."

174353943,"I'm doing well. This morning though I was tired!! Really exhausted!! I slept during my break and feel fine now. I think my medication and the heat are getting to me. Otherwise, I feel fine now! I am happy. My work is going well. I have to prepare a little more for my lessons. I got some advice which included to smile more and create a warm atmosphere for my students. Whatever!! Hostess teacher I will become!! So, the manager's advice made me laugh. Initially, I was wondering if he was serious. Smile more? I'm teaching, not posing for the camera! Anyways, what a life!! I still like my job a lot though. It is easier than most jobs. I also like teaching. I am happy about my job!! Life is not bad!! Today's weather here was awful though- showers and too much heat. I will be fine! I took my medication again and am doing well!"

I have been super irritable lately. I've been yelling at my parents and incapable of stopping myself after a certain point. I am extremely depressed. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to honestly. I don't know. I think I probably will at least try the IOP thing and see if they can work with me financially speaking."

175964323,"I used an experimental relative of Ketamine for my depression.It was a total miracle cure. But it elevated my blood pressure too much and ultimately made me manic, so, I can't use it. You should look into it."

175964325,"It didn't work. I tried it two nights in a row. Had to try it though! My pdoc I see on the 12 now so she can give me something I'm sure. I'll be stable until then, that is sure."
175964326,"I feel good today. For the 3rd day in a row, but last night had me in my feelings a bit. But I felt good during the day times. I always have trouble with night. But I worked out this morning and had coffee and took my meds too, at 7 or 7:30. It’s been an hour or so and I don’t feel super tired. Still, a little tired. And hungry. I really, really, really want some pan _NAME_ aka Mexican sweet bread ugh. Want it so bad."
175964327,"True. I give myself anticipatory dread over a lot of things; going to work, dealing with bureaucracies, making coffee, watching TV, just about everything. It works. Except for the bureaucracy thing: no matter what horror I imagine, it always ends up being worse."
174353961,"Barcode: It’s good that you’re looking out after this person. Most people don’t have that. You said this person has been diagnosed as Bipolar I. As a bipolar I myself (with the full mania), these people can be hard to work with. 1. Drugs.com says Abilify is an anti-psychotic…used to treat psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder and is also used together with other medicines to treat major depressive disorder in adults. 2. Klonopin it says is a benzodiazepine, and can be habit forming. (drugs.com says it is in the same group as Xanax and Librium, tranquilizers) 3. Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic medication also used to delay mood episodes in adults with bipolar disorder. If they are just taking the Lamotrigine, does it stop or slow down the mania? Does it reduce or take away the depression? You say, “Over the past year I have noticed many of changes finding out through that time that they discontinued taking their Klonopin out of the blue and to my knowledge no l
onger is taking the abilafy as well just leaving them the Lamotrigine.” You said, “Over this time I have witnessed self destructive behaviors.. a lot of lying.. saying things deep and meaningful only to turn around a few days later to discredit it all.” “I'm not completely naive about bipolar and the episodes it can bring.. I've noticed few where they deny it and a day or two later tell me their manic.” “But my question is how much does playing Dr with one's own meds effect someone with bipolar or not keeping up with actual Drs and therapy play in the mood changes and behaviors cause I'm loosing a good friend over the stress of it all.” You said, “these have all been being prescribed by a nurse practitioner and hasn't seen a psychiatrist or therapist in some time.” Is there a psychiatrist that you can see? It sounds like this person could benefit from seeing one, and then taking their medicines. And making return visits to the psychiatrist. Can you look up on the net and see if there are any 
psychiatrists in your area that you can see? You can also look on the net for Mental Health Clinics in your city. Such clinics usually have a sliding scale for pay, which goes all the way down to zero if you can’t afford to pay. If so, can you call one of these places and see if you can get an appointment? If so, check with this person to see if that is alright with them, and if so, make an appointment? You’re on the right track. You may be just a phone call away from help."

175964337,"It is called depression. I have struggled most of my life with it. I have tried suicide and been in psychiatric hospitals. You could have the most coveted life in the world and still wish to die when you have depression. Depression is a demon whispering negativity in your ear. I am 48 and over time have realized, for me, my very low moods do ease up and give me times of happiness amongst despair. I hold on tightly to the knowledge that things do get better for a while and are worth living for. Please call the suicide hotline for help. Look for a therapist and a psychiatrist for assistance.

175964338,"I thought it may be an interesting topic. I see time and time again the belief for people to constantly push their comfort zones and if you’re not taking risks at every turn you’re missing out on life. But here’s my take on it, what is so wrong about living comfortably in your same routines, if you are at peace and feel Stable. Risks do not always pay off and can actually cost you your mental health and well being as well as resentment frustration and regret. I think it’s dangerous even to promote risk taking as some kind of glamorous way of living especially when you suffer with mental health. I believe comfort zones should be promoted because it brings balance and contentment. People who step out and can’t relax within their comfort zones complain that things aren’t going right, life is too hard, but they carry on with the next big risk to keep repeating the cycle. There’s something to be said about a simple life and living within your comfort, maybe we should be more content with a 
life that’s comfortable instead of always chasing the next big thing? We are taught we need to live achieving everything we want but I don’t think that’s possible and that should be ok. But society says it’s not and you must go after it at all costs until you achieve it. There’s no limit to what you can do and all that nonsense, personally I believe everyone has limitations in some way and maybe that needs to be accepted rather than pushed and aggravated all the time because society pressures you. I’ve felt even more a failure because of my limitations with my mental health and the pressures of this warped society. Now I’m learning it’s ok and maybe they are doing it wrong and don’t have a clue. Taking big risks because of the influence of society and leading me to believe that’s what I’m meant to do to lead a happy fulfilling life has brought me nothing but stress and mental anguish. Ive had to figure out the truth for myself. What’s everyone else’s experience?"

175964343,"Possible trigger: The thing I have a problem with right now with today’s writing is, every article someone has to take the expert stance.

No. No I will not. If that’s what i wanted to do then I would’ve. The point of the article wasn’t that. It was to make you look inside and think of the questions I posed. What ever happen to writing pieces that are out of the box and different from what u read every single day now? What happened to allegorical writing? What happened to the imagination in writing and the depth? All it is on that site is “10 ways you can do this and that fast” or “here’s 3 reasons why you...” blah blah blah. “I’m an expert on it.

I just hope she doesn't get hurt on these adventures she's been going on. Or stolen. Or ran over. Argh. So much to worry about with this little kitty. My other kitty never wandered like this."

Someone mentioned this to me and as a person who is on hormonal treatment I realised that change in hormonal balance could be causing my depression.

So far I won a blue giraffe and a cat plushie. I only play the easy games because they are easier to win. I won the first 2 times on free coins.

175964384,"Is it possible to do multiple thing physical things to focus mentally? Like walk, have a hand ball to pump your grip, and listen to podcasts, youtubes, in your earphones? This really helps me. It's akin to taking a shower, where I notice my thought are clearer as I was, so I want to stay in longer to entertain ideas."
175964385,I think the next thing I'm gonna buy is the Pokemon Sword expansion pass
175964386,Sure are many reviews.
175964387,Was really unmotivated to get a shower today but I forced myself to because I was coming to work. I can't say that it made me feel better but I probably look better.
175964388,"So sorry to hear this additional news about your MIL and job. I think of you often and pray for healing, hope, and peace for you and your husband. What a terrible time you are having!"

That boosted my confidence significantly."

175964392,"i'm a 21 year old female. this wednesday i will be 22. my boyfriend and i celebrated over the weekend and i cant express enough how much i appreciate all the effort he put into it. mostly because i'm going through family issues and dont even want to acknowledge my existence let alone my birthday, the very bane of it. my family might have a history of mental health issues. my grandma was a depressed/anxious alcoholic, my aunt the same thing. one was treated with anti anxiety meds and she got all kinds of fucked up from taking them incorrectly. my whole life, that was kind of ignored and i wasnt even aware of it until a few years ago. we dont talk, we hide things. and i think it mentally fucked with me too. and i've coped with it however i have needed to. and now im at a point in my life where, i dont know how to cope anymore? i've had suicidal thoughts in the past. issues with eating disorders. depression. i get anxious. but how long can i go before i eventually kill myself? some days i really want 
to try to get better. other days it really doesnt feel like theres a point. this is all just too much. and i hate myself because feeling this way makes me think i'm ungrateful for the wonderful i have. but it affects my day to day. i had to quit my job because i just couldnt handle it anymore. i wish my boyfriend would break up with me so he wouldnt get dragged into this mess. i dont know. i dont know anything."
175964393,You've been doing a lot of studying.. School seems to be the biggest trigger for psychosis in people. It's stressful af. You're working too - Give yourself some credit ^-; The falling asleep to the TV can be a good thing - That's when you reason it all out. I make sure that I spend 20 minutes to an hour just thinking about what happened during the day and what will happen tomorrow - Then I stop and allow myself to relax and fall asleep.. It's an open awareness meditation without the focusing on the breath. Don't figure out things now.. The persistent harmful thoughts can be thought about later.. Cuz our thoughts are random we have 70k thoughts a day or something? Idk.. They can be programmed like a computer.

175964399,Oh cog we always want to hear how you’re doing so we can help if necessary or cheer you on if not. Ok here’s the thing...with covid a lot of us have been staying in and not going out really brings down a mood.

175964402,A short burst of extremely strenuous leg activity like a static bike ride can do wonders to relieve akathisia. Sprint for a 100 metres if you have no bike. Really push it until the lactic acid builds up. If you have akathisia really bad it is worth a try and it will really help.

Anyway, I don't think I have it in me to not notice him. It's ok. It's just part of life here."

175964407,"I talked to today someone from mental health who said she understand that my rights werent heard and my psychatrist directly violated me because he had phoned my housing and mother without my consent. I told her what had happened at my housing management apparently said i beat on someone in the elevator of the week before. I dont recall doing this i remember asking her not to call me those names and she hit me first and broke my glasses as well as ripped my shirt. I remember of her kicking me and punching me over and over again. I defended myself in my view. But management asked me how did i not know it wouldnt happen again. I said because i have never hit anyone in this building ever and this one time as if to say i kicked and hit someone which i didnt have that sort of recollection i remember her breaking my glasses and her kicking and punching me and wripping my shirt. If i had all the bumps, bruises, broken glasses with ripped shirt and she had none of that who is the aggressor? And why would i
f the officer asked me questions & that he didnt arrest me? I sought out a lawyer for more information into my rights. I asked to see footage but they continue to deny me. Plus on top of it all went grocery shopping with my mother i was there at least 4 hours and had to leave things off the list."

I gained a little more weight but that had more to do with the holidays than Zyprexa-induced binges like I was doing before the Phentermine. I'd rather ""stick with the devil I know"" than try another antipsychotic and have to learn new side effects to deal with. I think I'm doing okay now with things as they are."

175964414,"Hello! I hope you’re feeling better. I don’t know what to say but your post broke my heart. I thought about committing when I was eleven. I was so young, alone, anxious, afraid, depressed and filled with self hate. I thought about committing even before knowing that it was forbidden in my religion to take my own life. But I couldn’t do it because I loved my parents that much. I couldn’t break their hearts. Knowing that they will never recover after. So I stepped back. Today, I’m a young woman who’s still depressed but i try to have faith that the future will be better and brighter because everyone of us deserve that kind of happiness. This thing that’s called depression made me realize that there is nothing more important in the world than happiness and the peace of a mind. I’m still suffering but I’m still hoping for a better tomorrow. I really hope that you’ll do the same. In your worst moments think of your wife and the better future that you two will have. We just need someo
ne, a shoulder to cry on, a hug, someone to understand us and you have that. You have her she’s your friend, the love of your life, your rock. Don’t give up on her, on your future, and most importantly don’t give up on yourself. Seek help and do what ever it takes to make it work bcs we’re here for a reason."
175964415,"I have to be honest, I’m not eating anywhere near enough food. I’ve been restricting a lot and that’s probably why I’ve gotten sick more often (immune systems weak) and have been tired constantly with no energy and always freezing cold. Plus insomnia. I didn’t mean to slide back into these behaviors, it just happens slowly with “I’ll just restrict a little bit” then escalated from there. I don’t want to die at a young age. I need to get back on track with my _NAME_ recovery."
175964416,"Thank you both for your replies. I've decided to not use the CBD or ashwagandha again, since I have not had positive experiences with either, and I agree, there is just not enough research to support either supplement. I will try to just increase the lexapro and see how that goes, although as I said, it increased my anxiety and shakiness on the second day. Is this normal, if I did not experience any side effects when I first began lexapro? I hate this shaky feeling and that anxious feeling in my chest. Thanks for your help."

So...with your helpful responses which helped soothe my nerves I decided I needed to come up with a way to keep up. I prayed for help. I started taking Prevagen (LOL- what the heck it's worth a try-but expensive) I did some self- talks about why I really had a pass given the circumstances but committed to try and prevent any mistakes with checking, double checking, triple checking or possibly asking my co worker to proof my work. I told myself- you can do this. You got this. My night was somewhat restless but I've had worse. Before work I was still a bit edgy so I took 1/2 of a xanax First I re-checked my work- found one error and corrected it. Emailed my trainer- asked if there was anything he needed me to do. Sent him a spreadsheet that would help him with his work, Didn't have too much to do so I felt safe. Just so happens- people who have been there forever ma
de errors today that everyone was aware of. It was like a sign- let up on yourself. I still welcome the prayers and positive thoughts!"

175964421,"I tried 5mg and it also made me feel worse over a few week period. Although it was counterintuitive, when I jumped to 10mg it made me feel a lot better in about a week. Now it really calms me down...been on it 5 years."

175964437,"I can only share my experiance. 1. Stop and breathe! Those breathing exercises truly work. They stop mine. 2. Look around for a trigger. Once identified those can be used in therapy to work on. 3. Remember you are safe. 4. Get a dog. Yes I am partial to this remedy. My baby has saved me so much! He comes and demands to be held so I calm down and remember to take care of something other than myself. He is a Dauchaund. So I may be female but I proudly say, ""I love my wiener!"" Side effects can happen. However being in a medical study myself I learned that they have to report everything. If ONE person in the test group eats something wrong and throws up it is blamed on the study med. Even a migrane sufferer can cause a med to have that side effect. Mental meds are difficult to find the right one that works for you. Everyone is different. If you are that worried about side effects, write a journal. It can help see if the med is working for you. Also have your parents/guardians/close friends keep an ey
e on you. I have been on a med for years and I'm wonderful. I have a few minor panic attacks a year now. My service/therapy dog helps so much."

I had a very acute childhood trauma at a very young age that I can picture in my head as if it was yesterday, the smells, sounds, colors, etc. As I group up, I was able to be taken from the person who did this and grew up in a loving home, yet I always pushed those feelings down and refused to ever discuss them. 5 years ago I was hurt at work and am now disable in my right leg, have had 7surgeries and will never regain the use of my leg. I lost my career and money is tight. My therapist did dx me as PTSD, which I refused to accept for the longest. Now that I am beginning to accept the dx, I am hoping someone can listen to me. Did my childhood trauma get ""awakened"" by the accident or did the accident and complicated surgeries that led me to become disable also cause more PTSD?"

I noted (as indicated on Wikipedia) that I didn't dream for a week or so (usually recall all my dreams) but that was, of course, no big deal. No other sleep disturbances.

175964459,"I gotta say that if your bf or you are concerned, then swapping saliva is not the activity to engage in going forward - be cautious, continue distancing, and get re-tested. There are no absolutes as of yet with what's known or not known. Several places are still examining cases of tested, cleared and released people who then tested positive, in particular, South Korea, praised the world over for being one of the countries that's had the ""right"" approach. They had a resurgence after learning some people they ""thought"" were in the clear then tested positive again. One would ""think"" having anti-bodies would bode well, but this is still the very early stages of an emergent and spreading virus the experts worldwide DO NOT have any definitive answers about as far as re-acquisition or whether this virus possesses the ability to mutate different strains. An annoyance, yes, but regardless you should just act as if you were trying to not catch it the first time around. Monitor the coughing for sure."

175964475,"I posted something in the bipolar forum but many people here have mood disorders so I want to ask a question.. ""I have a friend with bipolar and she'll laugh one minute and then start crying the next. She goes through long episodes of mania and depression as well. I'm just wondering if the long episodes are from chemical imbalance and then the rapid episodes are from sensitivity? I'm just trying to understand. When I did MDMA once, I had drug induced severe rapid bipolar where I literally cried from a few seconds to half an hour at a time for 6 days after I took it. I counted how many times I cried and it was like 250 times. I would cry when a beautiful song with sad lyrics played on the radio in the car and I tried not to cry because I didn't want my mom to see me. I was laughing too and manic in between. It must be from being drained of serotonin? Or could it be malfunctioning serotonin? I think I must have answered my own question""."

174354101,"Little bit depressed. I keep focusing on how people do things or solve problems - How I lost so much time doing nothing. I'm not stupid but I acted stupid in the past. I don't know why it took a psychedelic trip for me to finally be as aware as everyone else. I never taught myself how to be independent. My ex step dad really damaged me. The Abilify basically caused my dissociative persona. I feel worthless because everything I did or said didn't get recorded. I barely remember anything from my past. I need a good antidepressant - But when I'm happy, I'm not that logical. I think I was depressed because I was so logical - Then I go to find out that being an atheist INTP isn't everything. I'm afraid of when people ask me to smile and I can't. People seem to know what they're doing. I'm upset because of what my mom does - I'm scared to be independent though because she explains my mental illness really well and defends me. The biggest problem for me is that I need constant reassurance. I don't trust m
y own thoughts and don't know who I am. I have a lot of apathy. Life isn't apathy in my own view.. It's being happy in a way. I want to do things but there's so many things to do. I'm not good at anything. Just a little bit good in many things. I don't make sense to people because I'm confused - The people in the video chat judged me and gave me rules. I know exactly what I should do but I just don't feel happy. I honestly feel really alone and sad. And I like sadness. I don't see the point in doing anything because we're all going to die. I want to have knowledge in everything and talk to people. My openness is so great that I'm interested in everything - Causing paralysis. And I thought this was the way it's supposed to be now that I'm revived by psychedelics. I was the 1% that needed to trip the most - Everyone else can get by with their awareness of how they are. I was really broken. I just wrote a morbid prose about isolation and suicide. I can't believe that I was soooo ****ing horrifically depressed.. 
And all the help I got. But it seems like that doesn't matter now that the world is on fire - Which makes me feel even more hopeless. Another thing is that I'm extremely interested in even my own pain, struggles, awareness, perception, illness, - Everything. My mind is so wide open that it's like I'm God - Creating reality and being interested as hell in it. But there's so much that I can do that it's overwhelming - And everyone knows this yet does it. I DID NOT know that everything is as connected as it is.. People get a job, quit, try to be happy, leave something unfinished. I thought there was no God.. Now I know that it it's unknown and we're supposed to not know. We're not supposed to know the complete truth - Yet we can pretend, do things.. But what's the point for me when my life is the way that it is and what happened?... I know what I should do. Basically this reply is meaningless. Things trigger me like my step dads depressive gaslighting.. I hate him so much. And I get some of my energy from him. I 
just want to punch him right in the face - I really wish I could. The first time I did it, it wasn't hard enough. I listen to music, and there's so much music to listen to. Technology is like a psychedelic trip rabbit hole that we can go into.. Same with life and the world. Do you think we'll ever be able to watch all the YouTube videos there is? I want people to feel happy - Yet there's yin yang and life has to be the way it is just because that's how it works. I can't save the world because I realize that I don't want to.. There has to be a variety of things or else life wouldn't be as great as it is... And that's why people put faith in reincarnation.. Because it's true.. I know that there's souls and unexplained astral projections happening every second.. One person dying and being born every second. It's madness. And we're all so delusional. I want people to explain what they mean and open up cuz there's such bad people. Not many people change their views so easily with new information. I could read - Bu
t I need dopamine. I need a new environment. I don't have patience so I want to absorb information and understand as quickly as possible because I fear having no money or dying, not experiencing life good enough and regretting things.. Yet it has to be that way - It's all perspective. I want to do so many things and a lot of people target me because they don't understand me like they ""Don't know me"" and it's ego empathy vampires. I absorb everyones energy. Sometimes I question whether or not I'm a good person but I know I am... And that's the problem. I feel stupid sometimes and that I'll never know - Or that it doesn't matter and to dooo thinggss.. Go to school - But I have to make the right decision in what can make me happy. I mostly feel like I'm running out of time and need to rush everything. I try meditation but I can't relax - I get scared. I can't be in a quiet room. I might go back to the psych ward in the independent living unit so my psychiatrist can treat me - But that's not what anyone else wo
uld do - I feel like that's wasting time or I shouldn't do that... That I shouldn't think I'm mentally ill and just live life - People say I'm not mentally ill because I'm too high functioning and ""not crazy"" so I believe them... All the things that sick people have said in the psych ward have made me sick even years after just because of a few sentences or words that they've said.. Sorry for the long reply.. I just want it to be sunny outside and to enjoy time without drama - Have good friends. I feel like people hate me - I'm not normal. I'm not neurotypical and find it hard to make friends cuz I'm smart or something - What ever that means."
175964477,"Dude, that sucks. I'm glad you can get samples, but healthcare really stinks sometimes. Then when you do get a halfway decent plan it changes. I'm worried because my company got bought out by a bigger company and we are allowed to keep our healthcare until December (and I really like this HMO that I'm on, it's really good compared to the others) and I'm scared I'm going to end up on a crap plan."
175964478,I wanted to formally say thank you for writing this and wishing me that. I am trying to implement being kind to myself and just nice and loving to myself how I want others to be towards me and how I want to treat others. I keep running into my self hatred though. I was relentlessly bullied by my family so there is a lot that I need to work through and I still believe having someone who loves me would help me in being able to. But I also know I need to be that for myself first. If you ever want to just talk feel free to message me. I would message you all first but honestly my ego can't afford to be ignored even by accident right now.

175964483,"Thank you all for you kind comments. I guess I am mostly concerned about the results of the tests. Even though I live an active lifestyle and eat good and am young, it still bothers me though. Funnily enough yesterday afternoon I started to become tired and light headed. I went to bed early and that helped but I still feel off though. Nothing severe. I took my blood pressure and pulse and they were botht normal. I guess I will see if anything is wrong when I get my full blood workup tomorrow. I wonder if it is because of my sleep issues .I was really tired and went to bed early. I need to get more consistent sleep.."
175964484,"I also struggle with bpd. In addition to ptsd GAD and severe MDD. I have not found anyone to treat me. I'm quiet bpd. I take anger out on myself rather than others. After having my sons, I retrained my brain so my sons would not feel the irrational side of this disorder. I think my biggest struggles continue to be regulating my emotions and thoughts of suicide. I hate when I get escalated cause of my reaction to someone's behavior towards me, and half an hour later, I'm still trying to calm down!! And nothing feels worse than when u are completely ready to die. If only it was just a decision that affected only me. But I had 2 sons and I have no right to leave them so alone since many passed away before me. I fight the urge way too often. Did u change ur sons diagnosis or did a professional? Cause I read the word ""probably"" bpd. Bipolar is very similar. One Major difference is the amount of time that the depression or the other feelings come and go. Does his depression last days? Does his sudden s
urge of energy last days also? That is bipolar. If the feelings change to 4-5 different feelings in a matter of minutes or up to half hour or so, that's borderline. Good luck. My prayers go with you all!!!"

While I'm still experiencing it, it actually is not as intense as it was in the beginning. Kind of like a really long panic attack. And with panic attacks, if you KNOW it's a panic attack and acknowledge it, it actually helps a lot to get through it. I like the idea of accepting it and realizing it will get better with time and positive thinking. Feeling optimistic. Thanks again D"
175964512,I am in graduate school and want to research early treatment and employment for the mentally disabled. I am currently taking a leadership class discovered reward sensitivity.

Any advice out there?

175964514,"I am so sorry for what you are going through. It seems to always happen all at once, doesn't it? I hope you are able to have these last days with your husband in as much of a calm and peaceful state as possible for both of your sakes. It makes me think of Psalm 90:12 says Teach us how to count our days So that we may acquire a heart of wisdom. Learning how to ""count your days"" wisely so that you can use this remaining time with your husband in the best possible way may help you to focus, have a clear, definable goal. Of course, there will always be flexibility needed as he will have bad days and so will you. But I do hope that even through those days, you find a little spark of joy, however small. The rest to answer your question on how to deal with life is to also take care of yourself and find something to keep you busy, to hope for, to plan for. Whether it's your home or trying to do an exercise routine, pets, travel (after COVID of course), faith, nature, whatever it is that can give you some
thing to look forward to can be very helpful when life seems to get to be too much. I wish you and your husband well."

I'll be like a mummified zombie"
175964519,"Yes, I took my night meds around 8 PM and my morning meds around 5 AM"
175964520,"My mom and dad don't really urge me to do anything. They are pretty understanding. What they do want for me is to feel better and do all of the things I want to do in life. My mom is my rock because she is always there for me and she is the one that can usually calm me down. I am super close with her and tell her everything. In the beginning my mom and I took walks together in an effort to get me out of the house. After a while I was taking walks on my own. It is getting cold out here where I live so the amount of walks I take has been lowered but I still do go for them time to time. Im unsure what the best thing for me is. I think at the end of the day I would like to feel physically better and well so that I can feel comfortable about the idea of doing things. In college I took all of the basic classes that you had to in order to get your degree. Math, English, science, history and other courses that fall into other requirements that I don't really remember that well. My strong points are math an
d English and I communicate with others pretty well I would say. If I took something there might be a possibility of that might enable me to break the barrier so to say. Im unsure though because that's my problem. I have a hard time believing what's going on with me as anxiety and I also have a hard time taking a medication in general because of fear of side effects and long term effects. I saw a psychiatrist throughout this 2 year time period that seemed to be very genuine and invested in helping me and making it so that I'm not suffering any more. I have had a female psychiatrist before but I stopped seeing her because my younger brother who was also seeing her was prescribed twice the amount of medication he was taking by her and my mom lost trust/reputability in her as a result."

I want to make friends but I am much tired of meeting selfish, toad people."

174354189,"Dear xopink3, Oh have you brought back memories of my son. He's now 23 and doing okay. Lazy, but stays out of trouble. My son was diagnosed with ADHD at 4. Started seeing a psychiatrist at that age also. His first in-patient stay was at 8. Between and 11 he had around 12 hospitalations; including 2 residentials. By fifth grade we were transferring him from public school to alternative schools because his behaviors were so extreme that public school couldn't handle him. Oh he had an IEP (individual education plan) and all that. He started puberty at 8. At 9 I signed him up for S.S.I and he was approved almost immediately. I was told about The Fengold Diet by his grandma (biological dad's mom). It's more of a food program and watching what you eat. Pretty much you go back to an 1800's diet. No processed foods. No red dyes. No canned food. You eat only fresh or frozen veggies. Fresh meat. Weened him off sugar as well. He was allowed sugar-free candy. Watch out for the sugar-free chocolate, because if 
you eat to much of it, it will give you diarrhea. White chocolate hyped him up less than milk chocolate or dark chocolate when a special occasion occurred. This diet turned him around. He went from (I think) 5 prescriptions to 1 and everyone that was around him asked me what I had changed, was it a new medication? He was as different as night and day. He was also on a Omega-3 rich diet an earlier time but without the success of the _PERSON_. When he was 19/20 he quit taking his medication after talking with his doctor. He had been on so many different medication that I lost count. But did keep a record of the ones he had adverse reaction to. There had been I believe 23. Ranging from mild to severe reactions. When he went off he said; he woke up one morning ready to take his medicine and realized the emotion or feeling he had been having was anger. His medication was making him feel angry. The anger stopped for the most part when he quit his meds. He is diagnosed as Bipolar and minor schizophrenia. When he was 
in grade school he heard voices that would tell him to hurt or kill someone. He could be very violent and was at times. He didn't understand and wasn't really old enough to be able to control or handle his behaviors. There were uncountable amount of times I would have to restrain him so he didn't hurt himself or anyone else. I have had to call the authorities on him because I couldn't handle or get him to calm down. As an adult he told me that there were times when he acted up because; one, it was easier and two, he got more attention. He knew the breathing exercises that works for him, can be respectful and responsible but he chooses to be lazy. He knows his limitations and what can or will set him off. So he plays video games much of his time. Friends come over but he seldom goes out. This is the life he has chosen. I don't approve or like it but he says, mom ""it's my life to live as I want"". Good luck and I hope this helps you in some way. Oh, and something else. You have to take care of YOU!! If you wea
r yourself out emotionally and/or physically how are you going to be able to help your son."
175964526,I want to lay on the floor and take a nap in my office. Too bad that is against the rules. I'm bored and I'm tired. Not a good combination. And whiny apparently
175964527,"Home. Went to pdoc and he raised my VRAYLAR. Then went to see the person to turn my art in and he said for me to reach out to someone specific about writing opportunities. Also, he wants me to do a written piece for art collectives new blog."
175964528,"Hello there, I hope you are doing fine, this is very common within most VH general living or co-existing experiences. At night things get amplified meaning the 'voices' & other associated experiences. Try to stay calm and use a distraction like placing headphones on ( inner ear ones will work better) Also, RedSeal is something you can add to your coffee, Also, sleep away from any overlooking windows or adjacent walls, coil spring mattress throw out and replace with foam. Turn all wi-fi routers and phones off. Try this and see if you noticed any improvement. If desperate stay over at a trusted friend's house. Take care and know this is very common we all go through this one."

175964530,"I went for a walk and now am feeling better. My grandparents are out of town. I just go from 100 to 0 so quick, it's scary"
175964531,"I see. I think that people in the UK have reacted fairly reasonably to what is being said. Yes, there is bulk-buying. However, the government is asking that people don't do that and to think of others and their essential needs. It's an interesting moral argument. Another argument being made is about those who continue to go out to pubs and clubs and in public more generally, against the advice being made, especially if they have respiratory symptoms. The argument is that these people may be acting immorally. I suppose as an ethical experiment it's interesting. The supply-stock shortage is a fairly obvious one to see happen. People are anticipating a risk of there being no or little access to supplies in the coming weeks and months and so want to make sure they have enough for themselves and their families. The whole 'you may be asymptomatic and spreading the disease, putting others at danger' argument is more interesting. Most people who still go out are tending to use 'we're young and probably are
n't going to die because of it' and 'everybody is going to get it anyway' as rebuttals which I think is less easily justified since, rather than being about survival, they have the capacity to put other vulnerable people at risk by refusing to let go of their current lifestyles. It'll be interesting to see what happens when more severe restrictions are imposed on us and how people act in response to that. At the moment, the government has only given us advice. I'm waiting for what happens when we are told we have to do something or other so to protect others."
175964532,"That's a really hard position to be in. Only she knows how she really feels, so it's hard to know what she really wants. You can keep sending her encouraging words, you could visit her but if she refuses to see you don't take it personally. What does she like? Maybe bring her something that she loves but it could worsen her mood. Does she like nature? Maybe convince her to go sit outside somewhere and just breath fresh air, talk or maybe eat(like a small picnic). Sometimes it can help to be around someone and not have to speak, just to have someone in your presence who will not make you feel judged and bring calmness. Bring her a gift, a card, or something creative from the heart that can be a daily reminder that brings positivity.You could do that online or in person. Just something for her to be reminded that you are there. Don't ask her a lot of questions and just let her know you are there and will not judge her or want to make her feel worse. Sometimes it can be hard when someone's mental heal
th is suffering to be complete honest or share their true thoughts due to shame or judgment. I'm not sure how she feels but maybe you can try something I mentioned or come up with something on your own. Hopefully you can find a way to help her."
175964533,Getting kinda anxious and sad here. _PERSON_. Maybe cuz I didn't sleep or something? Maybe it will get better or something.
175964534,"I appreciate you sharing your experiences with me, and you're right I was hoping to hear some reassuring stories about successful relationships but I know life is very rarely a fairy tale and in situations like this there are exponentially more stories of broken ones. Clearly that was not a stable relationship you had with that woman and you made the right choice to leave it. I hope mine will not end the same way, and though I appreciate your blunt honesty I don't intend to give up on my marriage just yet, not that I think you were trying to convince me to."
175964535,"Oh yea. I asked her if she had been a teacher in the past. And she said ""why? Because I'm aggressive?"" And I tried to say no but then she said ""you have to be aggressive with this sector of the population."" The mentally ill she meant."
175964536,"Super Tuesday is upon us. I'm staying away from the news as much as possible. I saw my pdoc today. We made a mistake about dosages for Trileptal, but Ill call back tomorrow so no big deal. I'm lowering my Geodon from 160 to 120mgs to help with akathasia and keeping it there from here on out. No other changes for now. BB, your facebook cat posts make me want to get a cat again as well! I've been reading up on _NAME_'s Paradise Lost epic poem. It's pretty deep stuff. After I review detailed plots and themes at lit charts spark notes, ill read the book itself. I always do this research for classic works part of the Western Canon. Some say I spoil the surprise but I love to chew on ideas for awhile. I can watch the same movie over and over again for weeks. You wouldn't believe how many times I've seen Matrix, Star Wars, and _NAME_! lol. I love subtle details. I think that's what helps me with philosophy. I've been binging Altered Carbon and I have a crush on the black woman who leads the Envoys. I love 
that actress. She's a goddess. Season 2 is very different."
174354193,To be fair I do also have panic disorder. So it might not even be the abilify that's causing the anxiety to increase. It could just be me.

On an individual level, it may exacerbate anxiety and psychosis-like symptoms as well as lead to non-specific mental issues (e.g., mood problems, sleep issues, phobia-like behaviors, panic-like symptoms). Cancer patients (CP) are more vulnerable to these psychological issues as well the viral infection. Contributing to these are the difficulties in get medical and diagnostic care, prescription drugs, and medical supplies; and the economic situation. CP with mental health issues such as OCD, PTSD, anxiety and depressive disorders, and paranoia may experience exacerbation of their symptoms.

175964594,"I know what to say. I'm not afraid of you. I look up to you. You're great! Lately I've been trying to think of paranoia and psychosis as a puzzle. There's definitely a way (In your reality) to curve your thinking (Unless it's really intense and you need antipsychotics - Which you do). But still a puzzle it is. Some people just don't get psychosis and they do psychosis inducing drugs and such. Me being me, I offer a different type of help to you guys.. The knowledge of chemicals and my own mental illness.. Those damn antipsychotic chemicals. They go into our brains and slow down our thoughts. It's what we need. Recently I've been on the edge of cannabis induced psychosis. Why? I'm an extremely curious person. My mom says that I'm ""sick"" and don't have insight to the chemicals.. maybe I don't.. I don't know for sure.. But I'm on an antipsychotic. So trust the meds. Make sure it's a sedating med. You need to feel sleepy during the initial phase of recovery from acute psychosis so you feel safer and 
more relaxed. Some benzos can help but not too much of them. If you don't feel safe, that sucks.. But you're a really intelligent cookie. Psychosis comes to smart people for some reason. It's like analysing the hell out of everything to the point of error, like an AI. When an AI runs the world, what if it gets psychosis because it's emotions get in the way? Who knows all these things. We're humans.. Understanding this really bizarre stage of our reincarnations. We're like light bulbs that turn off.. and when we do, we're lost, alone, confused.. We don't know for sure. There's no way of knowing. _PERSON_ The good can't be without the bad and the bad can't be without the good. It's a cosmic game and being awakened as you mention is actually a good thing. People need spirituality to get through everything. Spirituality isn't psychosis or sanity. It's a different thing that is good. No one is in control. Maybe there's no free will but you can make free will for yourself and transcend. Know that you are loved and 
many people are also suffering. Knowledge is key, awareness, adaptivity, building skills and relaxation."

175964596,"I could have written your post with a few changes. I have suffered from anxiety on and off for many years and it takes different forms but because I have always been a terrible hypochondriac, little things make me think I have some terminal illness. I also get scared when I’m eating something and panic that maybe it’s food poisoning because it tastes a little strange or are used a new cleaning product and believe it’s going to give me brain cancer. Being relatively intelligent, I recognize that these thoughts are ridiculous but it doesn’t seem to matter. Lately I’ve been feeling shaky all over so I am convinced that I have some type of blood disorder. Over the last few weeks I was having shortness of breath with mild exercise and was convinced I had lung cancer. It seems to always be something. When one symptom subsides it’s just replaced with another I have taken anti-anxiety meds in the past and hoping I can get more when I see my doctor next week but she is always adverse to giving o
ut benzo’s. She prefers to put me on an antidepressant but I don’t really think those work for me. I just wish I could get rid of all these scary here. As I’m sure you do too. It seems you’re suffering from a similar anxiety symptoms as I am but yours I’m not as focused on disease as mine are. It doesn’t really matter what we suffer from, it’s equally as disturbing and can really interrupt your normal life. I hope you get some help from your therapist but in the meantime I wanted you to realize that you’re not alone… Those of us with anxiety suffer from a host of symptoms. Good luck to you and getting some relief."

The group therapist told us that overcoming anxiety often takes time. My response to that was that I want to calm down now. Other members in the group said the same thing. The counselor told us that we needed to be patient. He was right. But it's still hard when you want the anxiety to go away quickly. However, I took his advice. And now that my anxieties have been low for many years, I'm glad that I chose to have patience. I'm glad that I gave psychiatric treatment a chance because it helped me a lot, even though the anxiety I was dealing with took a long time to go away."

175964623,"So, you both have psychiatrists, that means you probably have good information to rely on, unless your psychiatrists are no good. And those psychiatrists have likely told you that people do indeed ""come back"" from depression in that they achieve stability. But mental health recovery is not like getting over a cold. When you have depression, you are in recovery for life. It can get worse or better. Half of recovery involves therapy and prescription medication and the other half involve lifestyle changes (that are typically supported with counseling). To support your son, you can always be a good role model by taking good care of your own needs; meds, sleep, eating, exercising, meditation, support groups, working at job/volunteering, hobbies/past-times, social connections. Hopefully, he will learn by example. You can direct him to supports in the community, like day programs, drop-in centers and support groups. You can always suggest a medication change or a change of doctor, although that is reall
y his decision to make. If he lives in your home, you can also charge him rent, expect him to work, do his share, clean up after himself, and not make him tea! Does he make you tea? Hugs are great but let him make his own tea unless he is physically or intellectually disabled. If he isn't doing that, and he plays video games all day in your home, let him live elsewhere so he can grow up a little. If he plays video games all day and lives in his own home, your psychiatrist is right, there isn't much you can do except hope he follows your example."

175964633,"Yeah took a Vyvanse and an atenolol at 6am this morning, went back to sleep, woke up at 7:45.. After multiple attempts of trying to wake up but failing and falling back asleep lol.. My mom wakes me up and says ""get ready"" like a million times.. She understands though.. Half of the time I am a night owl and need to stay awake into the AM's.. Been feeling pretty good today though. It's just a good day - Maybe cuz of the CBD idk.. Seeing the doctor in two hours and I need a refill of; 60x atenolol 50mg 30x zopiclone 7.5mg 30x minocycline 100mg 30x 50mg Vyvanse (But I want an increase to 60mg so it can last longer - Or I'll ask for 1-2x 5mg Dexedrine so I can take whenever I need to focus - Reading, playing guitar, online courses.. It would be really helpful. I just prefer to have the extra 10mg as optional so there's less side effects). I think that's it? I only take 2.5mg diazepam now instead of 5mg. By the time I'm finished the 3 I have left, i should be non-benzo dependent. I think I already am."

The feeling of depression was good, all the music I listened to, the imagination in my mind kept me entertained.. I would wait for good things to happen to me but they never did.. waiting for nothing.. You're independent now. I wish to be independent too and I know when I am, I will hate it.. No money, family gone, but it's the way things go.. You have to reconcile, move forward.. It will be lonely but find comfort with your fiance - Tell him how you're feeling.. It's not easy to go from that place to where you are now. Why? Because it's change, and you were used to how it was.. It seemed easier but if you were in that place again, you would want to be in the place you are now.. So what you need basically is a vacation. Ask your mom for 
a vacation (She vacations a lot). Doesn't hurt to ask. I might be stuck in the hole worse than you were.. How can I be independent? I don't even want a gf or bf.. I'd sit and snort/smoke things.."

While there is no ""cure"", treatment does work, recovery is possible, and everyone is different, so everyone must find what works best for themselves.

I can barely do the stuff I need to and want to do because my anxiety is so severe that I don’t even leave my house anymore, I don’t even go and get groceries anymore, it’s like I’m OK to even be starving as long as I don’t have to leave my house or anything. That’s just an example that has happened before but that is one of the best examples I have because that shows just how bad my anxiety is. I have medicine for anxiety, I have Ativan, but I’m scared to take it too much because I’ve been on Xanax before and I’m scared I’ll get addicted to it or something, but gabapentin hasn’t helped at all for my anxiety. I think my first think I need to do is probably utilize the medication first at least short term, more often, and then utilize better coping strategies for anxiety.

Does anyone have any experience with BPD? Some days I spend a lot of time googling things, and I've taken numerous... What's wrong with your brain tests lately? Surprisingly, all of them, every one of them, came back with similar diagnoses. Obviously, panic, anxiety disorder, depression and the new one BPD. When I take those BPD quizzes, they all say, contact Dr, you have high likelihood of having BPD. Thoughts? Conveniently, Prozac is one of the top ssris to treat BPD. And i'm at 80 mg of Prozac now. I had a great aunt who was supposedly a paranoid schizophrenic. I didn't have a lot of contact with her over the years while I was growing up, but her last year of life, she lived w us (I was 19or 20) and her and I connected better than I have with anyone in my family ever. We were so much alike in ways, my father and my grandmot
her were actually surprised and I suspect a little nervous. I've never shown signs of schizophrenia but I wonder if great aunt even had that or if she had something else that was never properly diagnosed and definitely not ever treated correctly."
175964660,"This encapsulates the idea of Humanism, which must be the fundamental ""right,"" as it deals with normal human behaviour and provides the best framework for people to be able to be individuals without infringing on the rights of others. And that's where the issue lies: when we impose additional notions of right and wrong where they serve a purpose other than to support that basic rule. In most social structure there's an element of good and bad, but these only exist when people draw up rules to state the good and the bad. It creates divisions by exclusion. How many people have opinions that don't affect them? How many people get offended by issues they have no personal experience of? How many of them derive their belief in those scenarios based on research and objectivity, rather than their own internal conflicts raising their head in metaphoric association? The only true freedom is a releasing of specific rules and an acceptance of humanistic social responsibility."

What differentiates someone who is a loner type, you here it all the time with people who flip their wigs and go on a rampage “he seemed nice enough but kept to himself and didn’t really talk to anyone and was alittle strange” surely these aren’t all Schizoid people.

175964712,"aelachi: rxlist.com says about Anafranil (clomipramine hydrochloride), that is is ""a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) such as recurrent thoughts or feelings and repetitive actions."" The possible side effects include ""drowsiness and tiredness"" so I'm thinking it has some parts that help calm you. I was once on Sinaquan tricyclic anti-depressant which I always heard from the psychiatrist had a calmative affect. So, since your medicine, Anafranil, is also a tricyclic I thinking it might also have that. The medicine I'm on now for my bipolar is Lithium (for the mania) and the anti-depressant Mirtazapine for the depression. Those medicines seem to make me calm, also, and help with my anxiety. When I was only on an anti-depressant (Sinaquan tricyclic), I remember one of my quirks was, I'd be walking down the street, which I knew there was nobody else on that street, and I would turn my head to look backwards as if looking at someone. I knew this w
as some sort of unusual behavior, that I had some sort of problem (anxiety). But I recognize that trait from what you are saying. I think if you can get on the right medicine, this might go away. Or, increase the medicine that you have. I don't know anything about medicine except the ones psychiatrists give me, so you'll have to work this out with your doctor. Also, as has been said, some sort of talk therapy such as CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or CAT (Cognitive Analytic Therapy), which stress positive thinking that you can solve this and other problems. The resources section at the top of this list of people writing in with problems (""anxiety-panic resources"") tell what that positive thinking therapy is in written form, without having to track it down all over the place. You want to approach this problem, and others, in as many ways as you can. The net says other side effects of your medicine are: anxiety, restlessness, sleep problems (insomnia).

I have been getting as much as I can delivered because of COVID 19 and they sent me three!!!!! packages of my statin medication, that is the wrong dose!!!!! I don't even know what they are doing! They also sent me the Rexulti 4 mg and the Rexulti 3 mg like one day apart! Are they not checking their system?!! I only need the 4's!"

175964748,"Dear _PERSON_, My daughter (who's depressive-type bipolar) and I were just talking over the weekend, about times in our lives we each felt hopeless & that life wasn't worth living. She's having a really having a bad time right now. I always remind her that she's felt that way before, but it never lasts forever. Medication has been of great benefit up us both. We were both glad neither of us took the suicide route, even though we went through some very strong temptations. Reaching out here is a wonderful startup in trying to socialize with folks, without the pressure of making eye contact, making small talk when you have nothing to say, etc. This site is an excellent resource. Use it to the max! And more importantly, best wishes to you!"
174354513,"I don't have GAD. At least not diagnosed or anything. The anxiety started before the Abilify so IDK what it is. My doctor at the hospital basically said ""do more things and it will help"" I had to ask the weekend doctor to put me on something like Buspar to help... but IDK if it's helping. I'm also on propanolol for my Tachycardia which suppose to help with anxiety as well."
175964749,MMM sounds good!

175964753,Awesome! Have fun!
175964754,Yeah I wish I could be more social these days too. It’s tough.

175964757,Went to the community brunch earlier today. Need to take a shower now but dreading it for some reason. Have a new phone. iPhone 5 SE. yeah I know I’m waaaaaay behind with the iPhones but this is a lot better than my last one. Eventually I’ll save up and upgrade to a more current model.

175964759,I was doing fine with my therapist so we scheduled the appointments spaced out and I mainly see her for social anxiety anyway. My doctor doesn't have a voicemail to leave messages on. But I'm sure I'll be just as crazy Monday afternoon when I talk to him. Weekend options here are basically ER or crisis center it's dumb af.
175964760,"R., You are taking all the right steps to manage your anxiety...and doing an awesome job through this transition. Though you do have some added responsibility during this time, you also have a bit or a break from your sister's controlling tendencies as well.....so it's a mixed bag, right? ;) Keep up the great work and know that things will settle down soon when you finally sell and move to your new place!

I don’t even know if it’s approved for bipolar type stuff just hallucinations/delusions/sz. Just wondering with the impulsive stuff if you’ve ever been tested for adhd? I swear I never had it prior to bipolar but once I did it changed me to jumping from on thing to another. They won’t give me a stimulant but luckily the fish oil counteracted this for me. If you’re not taking fish oil, I’d say try it for a month and see if it works for you, like any med it’s going to depend on your personal genetics....it may or may not work."

175964766,"Machine elves (also known as fractal elves, self-transforming elf machines or""_NAME_"") is a term coined by the late ethnobotanist, writer and philosopher _NAME_ to describe the apparent entities that are often reported by individuals using tryptamine-based psychedelic drugs, especially DMT ""They offer things to you, saying ""Look at this! Look at this!"" and as your attention goes towards these objects you realise that what you're being shown is impossible. It's not simply intricate, beautiful and hard to manufacture, it's impossible to make these things. The nearest analogy would be the Fabergé eggs, but these things are like the toys that are scattered around the nursery inside a U.F.O., celestial toys, and the toys themselves appear to be somehow alive and can sing other objects into existence, so what's happening is this proliferation of elf gifts, which are moving around singing, and they are saying ""Do what we are doing"" and they are very insistent, and they say ""Do it! Do it! Do it!"" 
and you feel like a bubble inside your body beginning to move up toward your mouth, and when it comes out it isn't sound, it's vision. """

In a dysphoric mania.. But the cravings stopped because I had really vivid DMT-like dreams. I'm lucky that I can sleep 12 hours a night.

But my mood is overall lower because of the pandemic-uncertainty, stay at home order causing isolation, missing my work routine & buddies at work. But, I know this is not a mood swing due to chemicals it is due to the pandemic. I also have PTSD & added a noon dose we had stopped months ago of my Prazosin & that seems to have really helped. Now if I could sleep consistently without hot flashes or nightmares I would be at 90% right now I would say due to poor quality sleep I at about 75%.

174354539,"For a little better over a year, I've been struggling with a diminished quality of life stemming from what I presume to be a psychic incompatibility with cannabis use. The extent to which I smoked was not excessive, however it was substantial enough to alter some modulation within my neurochemistry. The smoking I feel acted as a sort of catalyst to ramp up some previously bottled psychological discomforts I had been dealing with; i.e, grief over loss loved one, degree of guilt over a relationahip (i was solely intrested in a physical material level, no emotional investment at all,)... The trouble really began when these symotoms began to induce harder and more psychotic disturbances, specs of paranoia began to overcome my consciousness, I started hearing the voice (ocadionally still do) of my ex girlfriends father projecting a over excessive authoritarian thought broadcast, resenting and reproaching me as to why I had behaved the way i did with her daughter and basically just continous uncomfortabl
e vocal projections into my neural consciousness. I started having disorented levels of reasoning and remember an ocasion where I stormed off outside and projected a hostile persona to street civilians encomoassing a _USER_ID_ charachter. That night i ended up being restrained(5150 involuntary confinement) and spent 5 days in a psychiatric ward, (also i thought beyonce; Illuminati Head Members, were conspiraring against my sanity due to my over inflated egosim and sense of superiorty. At a point i even believed cities fire dept/emergency care ambulances would schedule their warbing alarms at set precise intervals ( i am hyper sensitive aurually) and these loud pitched alarms would damn make me lose my mind, it was excruciating. I was prescrived Abilify and later attended some sessions with a Psychiatrist who perscrobed Risperdal to attempt and suppress some od these overactive neural impulses. It didnt work, I felt my level of inner depth and understanding of the root causes was too steong and only reinforced 
the behavior. I also tend to hear the voice of a male older aurotiatiran figure who tries to demean me and make me feel bad for not recognizing medicine as a superior practice amd profession. This rikes up my mind and emotions and makes me drop down in vibration to lower negative emotions. its been about 3 years now since these incidents, i havent touched cannabis nor do i intend to do so."

What you have sounds pretty rough. I suggest that you read the link at the bottom. Sorry, you have to copy and past it.

175964815,"How I honestly feel; Fear: Of inevitable pain that will come. Things revolving around in my mind, pestering me - nagging ""Pay attention to me"" - I have to deal with them but there's only so much that I can deal with. It goes in episodes of thought that I am and can't control - It's just how I react to this perception that matters. People will misunderstand me and cause me harm - That's why they're all out to get me.. I feel like I always need to just explain myself because I like me. Hope: Wanting things to be better - Just holding on. Maybe I'll be in a place in time and space where I can look at the stars again, listening to music or talking with someone/people and be ok. Love: For myself, my family, my cat, nature, for the good parts of the world. Confusion: That parts of my cognition aren't working properly - And that I'm unaware of how other people see me - Which is only ever how I know that I will see me. Certain things go right for me and others don't - If something changes, I have a disco
nnected feeling like ""Oh no"" or ""Finally, it worked"". Tiredness: Exhaustion.. ""When will I sleep? Dreams will haunt me and I have no choice"". Burnt out. Internet, reality, all of the things that I do which haunt me moments later - And it all piles up. Regret: We all have them. Might as well not think about them too much. Sadness: This is a part of life where I have to think about the environmental factors, how to solve, how to let go and experience, make the best possible life, make sure others are ok in the process."

175964824,I haven’t heard from my care manager in forever. Idk what’s up with that. It has to have been at least like a month and a half or 2 by now since we last talked. She used to check in with me regularly. It would be helpful now since Possible trigger: Ive been having suicidal thoughts
175964825,This was a different friend than the one I mentioned the other day whose cancer went into remission. This was my best friend since early childhood. He died from AIDS.
175964826,"Thanks for your concern.. but.. My psychiatrist basically ditched me due to cuts on funding for mental health before the coronavirus (Cuz oil was low and the economy here was crashing) - So she wasn't allowed to see anyone on the teleconference anymore. But there was an exception - To possibly see her once before she refers me to another psychiatrist. Then the coronavirus happened. Stimulants can be prescribed 3-4 times a day. I only take mine once a day. Today I took two. When I took my meds exactly as prescribed (Such as seroquel and mirtazepine), I had heart palpitations eventually so I stopped them. I see everything as a grey area. I'm not good with rules. EVERYTHING. All the problems that people are arguing about on the internet, I see both sides. My mind is so open that I feel like I shouldn't be alive. Everyone has beliefs and gets judged for them. I get judged by the video chat people for saying what I don't really mean - Which they take seriously. I don't take myself seriously. I laugh at 
myself. I don't think anything is real. I'm just trying to survive. I was a very weird kid too - Like completely disconnected from reality. I don't make any sense. I'm likely intelligent but schizotypal or something. I don't think objectively - I'm a mixture of subjective experiences - I know that I don't know things - In awe of everything? Autistic? I don't know. The extra vyvanse is to help me focus on reading as a distraction - Maybe play piano or guitar. I know I have a sleep-wake problem - Never got a sleep test. My treatment team is always so lazy or careful with me yet fascinated by my mind. I've always been praised for my mind - People do things.. I'm rarely ever in my element.. One thing (One very important thing): I've been on meds for many many years. And they keep changing. Most peoples meds keep changing, - People change, environment changes, we grow older, diagnoses change.. I feel like it's all absurd how people are so certain about things. Maybe if I had a SO or a friend, she/he can help me bu
t I don't want a relationship... And people all they live for is a partner, kids, and the pointlessness of it all to me - People make their own meaning.. I have to do that.. That's why the video chat people got mad.. They're right.. But it's painful to know the truth.. Some lies were said.. No one.. NO ONE - Thinks this much about their convictions and identity and the world and is so damn mental yet sane at the same time.. And the psychedelics.. I don't want to get started.. The government, conspiracies, jobs, passion, beauty in life, contentness, philosophy, spirituality, science, it's allllll gone out the window with my awareness. All I need is reassurance. I've said that for the longest time. That things will be ok. I don't know if they'll be ok.. I think things will be ok. Will they? .."

175964833,Hi Everybody I just haven't been feeling myself . I almost feel like I'm outside my body and it's not me. I have anxiety and depression. I'm just not happy lately. I can't pinpoint what it is. I see my therapist every other week. I can't seem to snap out of it. I take Lexapro 20 mg a day plus Xanax as needed which I've been taking one a day to try to help. Does anyone else ever feel like they're in the wrong body when they are depressed? Thank you for listening.

So I think I’m gonna start using that to get some exercise since I haven’t been out much.

So hopefully I can get back to eating healthy and now incorporating exercise."
175964838,"I'm pissed off beyond belief. I didnt have my meds. One of them. So I asked for an 4 day supply out of pocket from a local pharmacy because it was too early for a new supply. They gave me a 30 day supply. Which fcks up my packaging for my future meds on my regular pharmacy. It's a very long confusing story. I dont wanna try to get into it. But the doctor should've NEVER prescribed me just one medication in the first place. She knew better. And should've gave me all three. And now going on for the future, my whole med system is messed up on how I get my medication. So pissed."
175964839,"Hammer Smashed Face - Cannibal Corpse https://youtube.com/v/vlgiWBCbCJk I think metal is sometimes stereotyped as ""manly"" because most people stereotypically associate ""manly"" with violence, intensity, aggression and extroversion. Some who listen to it truly do embody that whilst others obviously don't. For example, the ex who got me into my heavier tastes in metal, has always been aggressive to the point that, at only 12/13 years old, he tried to beat one of his classmates to death with a 2x4 - with nails sticking out of it. He didn't learn to start behaving himself properly and staying out of corrections until he was about 30 years old. In this way, metal could be ""manly"" the same way a classic muscle car is more stereotypically ""manly"" than a Porsche or _NAME_. And the same way irritability, passive-aggression and a long-held desire to punish is stereotypically associated with women. Then again, women and men who seek status and money will be the opposite and find the fancy new car (and 
the success / intelligence / hard work associated with it) to much more more masculine. I see classic rock as the most ""manly"" given it's kind of laid-back, stable and is produced with talent and some thought (capacity to play instruments, sing without a ton of electronic enhancements, write music and write lyrics). But then I get confused because even though I'm not into women at all, a woman like _NAME_ was, was ######6 hot and I find women like her a powerful portrayal of female-ness (I don't know what word I need here since femininity is too weak I think). Probably not a popular current view of what ideal female is these days or femininity I Love Rock & Roll - _NAME_"

175964847,No a true meditation that’s where you go out Into the Woods near a stream and Babbling _NAME_ sit on a beach towel cross your legs and hold a position for 15 minutes and take you in the sound
175964848,"This is the accentuation of attention. You grab something from all the sounds, images that surround you and your attention is focused on it and gives it a special meaning, increases it as under a magnifying glass. Attention is fixed on some details, snatches out individual phrases. This condition can be caused consciously without any consequences for the psyche. Just limit yourself in time, suppose-1 day. It's like magic, you somehow start creating a new reality that swirls around you and involves you in your game. In the morning you leave the house and all that you can mentally attract, attract to yourself-accidentally heard scraps of conversations, accidentally seen lines in Newspapers, in the hands of passers-by, snatched phrases of radio and TV announcers, headlines, etc. I assure you, in the evening you will see how accurately these signs are woven into your life, how accurately they assess YOUR situation, to what extent they give wise and complete advice. You can turn on the TV in the evening 
for some program, and you will hear a great dialogue or monologue about yourself, about your life, about plans for the future. But this gift is from the devil. Do not forget the next morning to turn off all the accents and enter into a normal state of consciousness. The effect of accentuation of attention can occur when you for example, strongly hit your toe and then it seems that all passers-by try to step on this toe and each wall flies on this finger. It's like the energy of the situation is working. Such is the programming is obtained."

175964859,"""I said that I am an atheist because that means that AA will not work for me..."" I haven't drank for 24 years or attended one AA or NA meeting during all that time. I'd drop in for a 20 year commemorative key chain but it doesn't even mean that much to me. I have, however, sat through enough meetings to know your ""Higher Power"" doesn't have to be God. Someone else can explain it better than I care to. ""yes, it's a poor coping mechanism but it helps me get through all the mess..."" The problem with that is the mess never really goes away when you drink. It's still there when you sober up along with any mess you may have gotten yourself into while you were ""trying to escape reality"". Reality will still be there come the cold light of day. ""still it's like I need a better reason to get off the stuff than I currently have..."" You said you were still young. Give it time. Maybe drinking won't cause you problems with the legal system, relationships, etc. Maybe it will and that's what it will take 
for you to see stopping drinking more attractive than continuing to drink. Everybody's different. ""it makes me feel so much better and that will be hard to give up."" That's why they call it an addiction. I've got no stake in whether you quit drinking or not, so go with my blessings. I sincerely wish you the best of luck, you're going to need it."

175964902,"_NAME_ was having excessive panic attacks. The attacks were intense, erratic, and debilitating. They lasted anywhere from brief seconds to a longer incredulous 30 minutes. Worse yet, they came out of nowhere with unknown causes or triggers which kept her from fully functioning at home, work, and socially. She was embarrassed, ashamed, and defeated by the attacks. A normally social person, _NAME_ found herself withdrawing from the people and things she loved the most as her fear of the panic attacks worsened. Her predicament was strange because _NAME_ was a lovely person with a friendly personality and these attacks were so contrary to her nature. She was able to converse with a wide variety of people and unusually comfortable in new environments. She was engaging, delightful, and pleasant to be around making these panic attacks that much more out of the ordinary. The attacks began when she was a teenager and had been getting progressively worse as she aged. To the point that now well into her 30’
s, she was unable to hold down a job for longer than a few months, her marriage was on the brinks, and she had few if any friends left. After ruling out several disorders and medical conditions, _NAME_ was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). But on the surface, she did not look like a person with BPD. She didn’t have emotional outbursts, didn’t openly display any fear of abandonment, never made a suicide attempt, and had a long-term relationship with her husband. However, these symptoms did manifest internally, not overtly or externally. https://pro.psychcentral.com/exhausted-woman/2019/08/what-is-covert-borderline-personality-disorder/"

175964924,"When I had my shrink appointment on Monday, the doctor said it sounded like i felt ""stuck"" in my situation. It did not seem right to me, that I don't feel ""stuck."" But, the only feeling i could come up with is jealous. I was jealous of those who do not have issues. So, I have been thinking about it for the last couple of days. What is it that I am actually feeling/wanting. I do not want out of my life. I love my daughter, husband, siblings, parents, and career. I don't feel ""stuck"" in my situation. I just wish I was not me in this situation. I feel it is not fair to my loved ones and friends. I feel like my feelings do not fit my situation in life. I should be happy and content (I know, those ""should"" statements are not helpful and are caused by distorted thinking). I just don't necessarily feel up to the job of being me. How do I feel? - very depressed, frustrated, tired, and ashamed. Why do I feel this way? - no idea. My life is good. I have an appointment with my shrink again next Friday
. I wonder what I will say. Will I have dissected my feelings enough to make it clear for someone else to understand? I have a lot of SI, but it is more like an earwig than an intended action. I keep hearing inside my head (not with my ears), ""I want to die."" But, I do not want to die. However, as this depression continues and is even getting worse, I am having a harder time with these thoughts. They used to feel like they were no big deal, just a song I could not get out of my head. But now, it is morphing into something else. Not sure what, but it is changing. I still have no intention to act. But, the idea is becoming more and more tempting. I will not take my life. I cannot do that to my loved ones. As I always say, ""if i am willing to die to unburden my family, I should be willing to live, so I do not hurt my family."" So, where does that leave me? Trying to figure out how to deal with these feelings and how to feel better. I need this depression to lift. It is getting int the way of my life."
175964925,I went in there looking for bar soap and they didn’t have it. Luckily another store in the mall had organic based bar soaps in like gardenia and other scents.

175964940,Hi That is good news your results came back all clear. I can relate as I have bad health anxiety and whenever I get tests done and they come back normal I always start to question the results and get intrusive thoughts that they have missed something or they are wrong. When I get in these situations I like to use mindfulness meditation as it helps me to relax and helps silencing the intrusive thoughts. Have a look at our resources section for some good links. _PERSON_
175964941,"Good points. That's something I always believed from a young age. Also why I thought everybody was an hypocrite. They were doing stuff they did not want to do, pretending to like it when in fact it was just a means to an end, but not even a compatible one. It's like being miserable for the sake of it and hoping for an afterlife reward that may or may not come to pass, but while you did that, you sacrificed the life you did have. Why hope for happiness when you can have it right now? And how is it that leading an unhappy life make you ready for a happy afterlife? Chances are you won't be able to enjoy it, or know what to do with it, same as now. That's what I understand as false self, and it shows a bit everywhere. One thing I noticed young adult, was that people were quite gregarious, until they got a sex supply, at which point they would suddenly disappear. So all the friendships and antics were just means to an end, not the real thing, and it showed when you pushed a little. Why people choose to 
live this way is a bit beyond me. This being said there are some people that do those normal things and are quite fulfilled in it, and they would not want it any other way. So they probably describe normal, because they are leaders and happy. Plenty are wannabes though, who think normal is only the appearance of it, not the internal self-driven drive for it. I saw it in a striking way, in the _NAME_ autobiography, at least the parts I read. It was all like that. The whole drive was to look in a certain way, even though the internal reality was completely different. There was no thought about doing things for its own sake, it was all geared to look better than others, not even simply the same but better. So its envy to an nth degree, and jealousy when it does not work, or when those achievements are not recognized. It lead to murder eventually. Yes, and that is something I often say to people, but they deny it. Mostly people that rely a lot on empathy to move around and do things, have that presupposition deep
ly rooted, but unconscious. Not surprisingly, because ""diversity"" and tolerance of it is what people claim to like. But that also is a means to an end quite clearly. The last thing they want is someone feeling differently than they are, but they might accept different behaviors, as long as the feelings are right. It can lead to a lot of misunderstandings, because they assume you are the same, so they aren't talking to you but a ghost of themselves. And if you tell the real you, they will correct you. Either that, or they will simply suspect you of something nefarious, because the behavior is not consistent to hiding what they would hide, thus the hiding must be worst and monstrous. If you don't hide small things, then there must be bigger things. Or if that person does not want to steal this small thing, they must be aiming for something bigger. That's pretty much what I was telling my previous doctor, which funnily enough took his retirement. Fortunately I would say. The new one just signs stuff, which is 
a lot better. I don't need moralizing from some person that hasn't thought things through, and I did not want to share his miserable life. Not surprisingly, he wanted gratitude for his work. If he did what he did out of love and not for some other reason, like looking mature, which was his big thing, he would need no gratitude and in fact he would be grateful for the opportunity to do what he likes and signed on for, which is to sign my papers. For some reason he never expressed such gratitude, and that's because he is a fake. The new one seems genuine. It does make quite a difference, because the fake is going to cause all kinds of problems for no reason, while the other won't. Little sabotages all the time, it gets annoying and old pretty fast. Its hard to fight off as well, although I have possible plans for one of his accomplice. It's an interesting question, and it turns out the coronavirus is giving some answers to that. People are basically forced to adopt schizoid-like behavior and thinking because of 
an invisible threat, but that is real nevertheless. So you can see the type of reactions. Some deny it because they can't see it. Others want to show they are courageous and become reckless. Others are ambiguous and try to compromise, so they turn to superstition, like mask wearing. They are ready to take risks as long as there is a possibility that they might be able to diminish it. But their prime goal is not health or security, even though they pretend (that's the false self). Some schizoids do that supposedly, in a metaphorical way. Some like me makes charts and try to predict deaths. Mostly though, people become religious. Some experts are put forward, and they preach the good news, or the bad if people sinned like not washing their hands. They preach social distanciation for the mass, and special protection, masks included, for the sacred, the essential worker. Those masks are a special garment reserved for the rituals of healing and food distribution, but reserved only for them when doing said rituals. 
Although this protection is mainly spiritual and a sign of sacred, others are allowed to wear counterfeits, or at least they were able to force them to admit grudgingly that everybody is essential in some ways. That's how religion and superstition fight each others, or deal with each others. But the idea here is that everybody does the same, act the same, for the same reason, which is based on ""science"" all the while trying to deal with nitwits who don't follow protocol. All on their own though, people would not become schizoid, they could not because the guidance would not be there, so they would look for it and then they stop distancing. They will only distance if they are convinced there is a good reason and that everybody else is doing it, except the sacred. There is a reason I promote religion. I can see needs, but also why people don't fulfill them. For me, this whole thing is mostly business as usual aside from a few inconveniences. For others it is a disaster, or for some an adventure. Lots of diffe
rent feelings going around, but nobody is indifferent. Fighting this is like fighting human nature and how it organizes naturally without falling into superstition, but without falling into irreligion either which is what the denial does. Also why I jumped into its theology pretty fast and tried to be conversant in its symbolism and causalities and models. The whole phenomena is interesting though, rarely will you see a religion appear and organize in a few months, or even a few weeks. It already existed though in Asia, which is probably why they are doing better than Western countries, which tried to mimic with limited success so far. I don't think it is really a matter of right or wrong, its about what works for which goals. Its one of the peculiarities of the Western mind to thing in black and white. Right or wrong, instead of simply what works, and having goals and plans. Sometimes politics is more important than the truth, and that is the main thing people are rediscovering which I suppose comes as a sho
ck. It's been going on for awhile though, way before the virus, which simply accelerates the process. There is also a question of temperament. Some people want to conserve, some others want to spend, and each have their own advantage and disadvantages. Its been a few hundred years that people suddenly decided and spend was the way to go, its the liberal model. Spend, create and consume. Its good until it becomes reckless. Now there is an opposite trend, towards conservation, which is why nationalism of all sorts are appearing. Overall though, nationalism is stronger all things considered. Its more stable, more just, and does not lead to a catastrophic event, but can lead to a slow death due to lack of motivation. The lack of ability to imagine or deal with intellectual things, or enjoy them, I wrote about a few times in the past. A few years ago I gave some links to the desert fathers, which were giving tips to overcome that. Its certainly an issue, and quite possibly the schizoid is more at ease in that worl
d than in the physical world, while for most people it is the opposite. So there is truth to it, and it is a well known thing, or it used to be well known. People compensate by watching movies and so on, and again, it is what religion tried to provide with the means of the time, some things to think about for those that aren't exactly great at it, or inclined to it. They even forced it on people, once a week, to make sure they made a slight effort. It was a conscious decision to do that, but at the same time, it also forced schizoid types to interact with others in a safe environment. Lots of things could be said on that subject alone, which is complex with lots of twists and turns. But my opinion is that in the end, the destruction of religion, at least that one, basically allowed something like schizoid to be considered as a disorder. But it was quite ordered in the past, it just isn't valued anymore unless money can be made out of it, which is usually rare, and not exactly a money maker, because once an id
ea is out, it does not destroy on consumption, so people can just appropriate it, and not pay anything. So the schizoid gets robbed of everything. His ideas, dignity, etc. All the more reason to avoid others. It just adds insults to injury for no reason."
175964942,"Completed my letter of complaint about a medical receptionist. They are my nemesis in life; talk down to people like they are mentally challenged. Jumped up uneducated staff who think they are in a position of power.. Thats a trigger for me. I had tried to make my third attempt to secure an appointment with a psychiatrist. It is really only because I need a diagnosis written on paper, so I can plead a case for disability allowance. Any diagnosis would do at this stage. It is not a time to be fussy about misdiagnosis as I need to cease work asap and I need to NEVER work with or for others again. My referral letter was dated 2018, so receptionist with her bureaucratic tunnel visioned power play stated I need an updated one. I used the word s'hit( in response to having to harass my g.p.during this busy time) and she accused me of being abusive, then hung up on me. Stupid cnt. Especially as government departments have relaxed the red tape entailed in health care while covid -19 is in our midst. I could 
write an essay on our conversation... but to cut it short, I am wondering if I will come across as a total f'wit lodging a letter of complaint during this time. Yeah.. I think i'll do it."

I’m currently taking CBT but this anxiety hits me so bad in the mornings and during my time of the month...I really want to get this behind me ...it’s 5 months since it came back and boy has it hit me ...more than physically it hits me mentally with unwanted thoughts and fear of the worst ...it happens more when I’m by myself ...if I’m around people I’m fine .."

175964948,"S., I am sorry that you are feeling so frustrated and still in discomfort. I can imagine how frustrating that must feel...especially after spending so much money and being shuffled around through the medical community. Forgive me for not remembering if you have consulted with a psychiatrist? This medical doctor, who happens to specialize in mental health may be just the medical professional who can help you get to the bottom of what is causing your symptoms. If you have had a P-doc consult, what was the outcome? Did you follow up on all recommendations made by your dr.? If not...if it is at all feasible, I really recommend doing everything you can in order to make this happen. It could really help shine some light on what you are dealing with...or lead to the referral that you really need. Wishing you the best, and do continue to work your self help to keep you feeling your best, despite the difficult circumstances you are going through. S.C."

175964977,"Hmm, I can understand it can be very frustrating, I am not diagnosed with OCD either but as in terms of health anxiety I have my own rituals, false beliefs, intrusive thoughts, etc. When persistent thoughts come, my way of dealing with them is treating those thoughts as someone else's. Not necessarily the moment I have them first because it's usually very hard to deal with them when you are caught unprepared. But after a while, I re-evaluate them by replaying them in my mind from another person's mouth. Like I am listening to a stranger and how I would react to those thoughts. Because your reaction is what counts, not the thought itself."

175964979,Here's a figure from the aforementioned book by _NAME_ Stone. I post it here because schizoid is the prototypical personality disorder according to _PERSON_.
175964980,I showered friday and it was agony so enough for a while..
175964981,I actually am gonna do that! With either coursera or udemy. Whichever is cheaper.
175964982,"Yes, I find animations very often cheer me up. There is something soothing in them I guess. Anything that reminds you of your childhood is bound to be soothing to you."
175964983,"That’s for your kind words, Onward. Since 3/13 I’ve been staying with my parents to take care of them and keep them from going out, worked from home a couple weeks (only going into the office when we had patients), and then coming home to take care of my house and spend some time with my husband. Then on 4/3 I’ve been furloughed, but being a caregiver and taking care of 2 households has been exhausting. Not to mention trying too add additional means to help with my stress/anxiety/depression, it’s been a bit crazy (I guess having increased symptoms shouldn’t be surprising. But I can home yesterday afternoon and will go back to my parents tomorrow. My husband went to check on his parents, so when I came home yesterday I wasn’t sure how I would feel being alone. But it’s been good. I didn’t pay any attention to the slight mess in the kitchen, unpacked my stuff and watched tv. Today I haven gotten out of bed yet except to check if the unemployment site is working so I can submit my week
ly claim. Not yet!! I do feel a little more calm and feel like I can breath a little better. Until tomorrow morning when I go back to my parents, I’m going to spend the rest of the time just focusing on me. This is exactly what I need to do more often. I do not always need to be running around doing something. See I do know right from wrong, I just get so wrapped up in life’s problems, I forget that if I’m not whole and take care of my needs, how can I help the people I love. I think I’ll give myself a pat on the back for that one?! What do you think Onward? BTW... how are you?"
175964984,Excited about tomorrow ?
175964985,"Try not to worry. During these crazy times, we are all going though this. So you aren't alone in the way that you feel. I am having a hard time going out because of not going anywhere. I get anticipation anxiety whenever I have to go somewhere. But once I get going I am okay. You will be too. Try not to think about it so much. Try to find things to do within the home. Something challenging. Maybe puzzles or something. I know it sounds corny but it takes our minds off of everything. A good book maybe. Hang in there. I want to say this will be over soon but I am starting to think it is the new normal. Which stinks. I hope that your day gets better. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175964986,He is very regal

For clarification, I was abroad attending this program before, but had to return to the USA due to COVID-19."

Unless he is manic all the time. Which I don't think he is. He is just high energy and yes it is annoying. One day I purposely did that to him. Brought up a topic and kept talking about it and asking him questions. He had to leave. I don't think he liked somebody else controlling the conversation. It was rather funny. I think like _NAME_ said there are personality traits that can be considered. But it is true when people are manic they can talk a lot, do a lot of things to excess. So it is a good thing to think about because like you said _NAME_, they probably can't help it. Good topic... Hugs, _NAME_..."

175965003,Apparently it’s flexibility in the pfc that allows for creativity....you have to be able to switch from low pfc to generate ideas to high pfc to sort and apply them. I honestly wonder if people with bipolar etc are just too good with brain flexibility....

175965014,"I thought I'd give a quick update. I'm two weeks into a 30 day monitor. My cardiologist said she thought it wasn't anything to be worried about and sounded like simple ectopic heartbeats to her. SHe still wanted to get an idea about what all I was dealing with so we could make better plans on how to treat it. As she put it ""Obviously, just throwing pills at it to see what works and what doesn't isn't the right answer for you based on how your body reacted to beta blockers."" My palpitations have primarily been calm since getting the monitor. There's a few days I'm having to hit the button a good number of times. Today is one of those days where it seems like I'm having several an hour, but most days they have calmed down (and certainly nothing like I saw after taking the beta blockers.) Ironically I did have to adjust my blood pressure medication. My doctor raised me up to 10mg a day of Lisinopril and, as usual, my body did not like that. I went from an average of 140/90 down to 115/75. I felt lik
e a sloth during that period. Everyone said ""that's normal"", but the problem is when you're used to a higher blood pressure, you don't want to go to normal at breakneck speeds. I'm balancing it with one 5mg in the morning and one 2.5mg at night now which seems to have kept me from having issues."

175965022,"OK, so I'm in this Al-Anon meeting, for people who have friends or relatives with alcoholism, and it comes time for me to speak. I give my feel-sorry-for-myself negative spiel of how worthless I am and how rough my life has been. That's the way I was raised, OK. As a 5 and 10-year-old, I believed what my parents said. That was my first mistake. As can be expected, I carried that downtrodden, negative attitude into my adulthood, just as I carried the English language into my adulthood as I had been taught as a child. So, in the Al-Anon meeting I'm what? A 45-year-old, negative-baby speaking English. This woman sitting next to me did not believe my parents, that I was an idiot who had a rough life, and she was not negative. She did not gaslight me with constant statements that both me and my life were worthless. She erased everything my mother had said to me for 45 years in three seconds. How did she, a total stranger, do that? By, after I finished feeling sorry for myself, she said, ""Oh, you were h
aving a Pity Party. We've all done that."" And she had the nicest, most understanding look on her face and in her eyes. The 45-year-old baby was exposed in front of the group of being a baby, of believing what my mother had said. She did not believe that. She overrode my mother. What was the commonality? Both were females. I needed that common bond to make the transfer, one of them cruel, one a savior. I had unconsciously looking for that person all my life. I changed my allegiance from my pathological mother to this nice woman, who I never saw again, in about 5 seconds. As a 45-year-old man, I never wanted to be exposed in front of a group again as being a big baby. It was like electric shock. My psychic was struck by the nicest, most understanding but insightful, and, yes, mothering person I've ever met. If you've never been embarrassed in front of a group and exposed as being nothing more than a big baby, don't try to guess what that feels like. Because of that pain, information and compassion at the same 
time, I have never felt sorry for myself again. Because every time I try, I see that woman's face and I hear her voice and my Pity Party just doesn't work as I try to curl up into a ball and be a 5-year-old. My allegiance is still to her. That compassionate mother figure. My guess is, you are getting some kind of reward for believing a parental type person in your formative years and you do not want to be disloyal to them and believe that they did not have your best interest in mind. So you cling to where you are, even though you complain about it every now and then. But you really love it and can't be talked out of it."

175965026,"Ok so take the needed steps to become less isolated....the other grad students are off the table but you can still make friends other ways. I met one long term friend on Craigslist which can be a little dicey but now a lot of dating apps have friend finders as well....although people can be weird about if they want to date you and you’re only looking for friends. The classic way if you’re not into the tech is to join an activity, maybe a painting or poetry class at a local community college or your cities recreation center. Join a sport or meetup group. Goto a coffee shop or grocery store and talk to people waiting in line if they haven’t pulled out their phones yet. As a person with social anxiety I can say that none of these things are easy for me but I’ve done them all. Finding friends is incredibly valuable even if you only find one. I do think you should get the degree but only because you’ll be ahead of the game when you’re done. 8 hours of zoom sounds crazy to me tbh."
175965027,"Silent whispers in my head I want to end up dead Feed me fruits and lead Nighttime falls and then dreams No one said it would be so hard No one warned me with their finger Empty hallways and a bright light Locked away where shadows linger Behind bars, I want to be free But solitude is the only comfort for me I'm deathly alone, walking home In my mind, they say I'm on my own But I dream as I write, I write forever When my heart stops beating, I won't remember Eternity is a long time And right now I seem fine Although my hands frozen cold I feel the panic unfold Nothing is ever said to me My head is never empty But full of meaningless thoughts that haunt me Spiralling around, interesting Falling asleep again, the dream never ending Open my skull and take it all out I don't even know what this is all about"
175965028,"Thanks, SO much for this kind comment at times I feel like a criminal just for having the knowedge that any Human Pathological diease does not talk back to you attempting to shame, emotional blackmail you or subject to to gang stalking, this in my view is what the UN and EU are branding as Cyber Torture or electronic harassment as it using wi fi type of needs ( technology ) hence the name cyber.

175965034,"So the 2-3 hours before I go to sleep are usually low energy.. like I'm done for the day. I notice that when my dad comes to visit, he would say that he's going to sleep but would actually be watching movies in the dark until 3am. My mom does this too but texts and goes on FB. So what I'm going to do from now on is to stop trying to know everything about investing, crypto and learning in general and just play podcasts for an hour or more and lie in bed.. I used to do this with a radio when I was a kid. I can't believe I stopped doing this. It pleases my mild autism ^-;"
175965035,Morning Didn’t sleep great last night as I went to bed at 4am but I did sleep a bit. So gonna try to stay awake all day. I feel fine honestly.
175965036,"I know. I’ve become paranoid about telling people where I’ve been like a store or around people with no masks. Idk. Its paranoia because people will then act like they don’t trust u and they don’t want u near them. But then it’s like, well I don’t wanna get anyone sick. But idk. It just sucks. I have to go pick up my car today too. Which requires going to my dads. I think _NAME_ wear a mask there. I thought about picking up more pan _NAME_ but idk. Cuz that requires going into a store but at the same time this specific michoacana is very small. Like only 3 or 4 aisles of food and a few freezers. Bakery in the back. But idk. I honestly just wanna stay home. I don’t feel well. But I think it’s cuz I had heartburn last night and laid down after eating. Cuz I feel nauseous. But it’s the kind of nausea that you feel when u feel acid in your throat like gurgling there. Plus a headache but a lot of times I have headaches the next day if I cried really really hard. And I did last night. I 
sound like I’m talking myself out of thinking I’m sick with Coronavirus but there are some really probable causes to my current symptoms."
175965037,"Oddly for me music in movies can make me emotional, not the movies themselves. I just connect very strongly to music."

175965053,"Yeah, I remember seeing articles about the 128 thing, too. I think the 256GB cards were like $120 though when I was looking at buying one in 2017. The 128 one I got was $50 at the time, so it was less than half the price. The 1TB cards used to be like $440 last year, but now they're $250.

175965092,"Hi, do you know what causes this?"
175965093,"One needs to understand there is a huge difference between shyness and severe social anxiety. I believe many people who are ""shy"" have an endearing quality about them. They also seem to ""listen"" very well - a great characteristic! I also believe ""shyness"" may be something you are born to be, and may be something you were meant not to change about you! I don't believe simple shyness precludes you from a wonderful quality of life - thinking otherwise sounds a bit prejudicial. As you become older, you will probably understand this better. P.S. I am not what one would call a ""shy"" person."
175965094,"There's inspiration all over, just have to look. Pretty happy today"
175965095,"The thing is, now that we know(are aware, and theres no way back to unaware).. we have a choice. Either to live in a life full of fears, or just simply dont give a ###$. I choose the latter. If you let go of fear, then youll start to think more normal after a while. I have days where i most of the time dont think so much that my thoughts are being heard. One more thing, we are having this physical experience, so make it as good as you can(despite the fact that your whole world has turned upside down after the ""psychosis""). Make your body/brain as ""happy"" as you can EVERYDAY. What i do to make my body ""happy"" is working out. I started it 5-6 months ago. You set goals. And you do the best you can to reach those goals. F ex if you can bench press 80kg set 86kg as a goal for the next month. And so on. Your everyday life gets a meaning. You start to think thoughts like: ""damn, i shouldve been able to lift that weight"" ""hmm maybe i should of done this instead, or that"" etc.. And for the brain, 
study interesting topics, i myself like science alot, so thats what im studying. Im even planning to go back to uni again."
175965096,"You're not alone. I understand. I really do. I've been dealing with this for much much longer. I did try to overdose once. I don't talk about it because it makes people uncomfortable. I was even told that I was just attention seeking. That's so not true! I get the way it feels like I have weights pulling me down sometimes. I barely have the energy to get basic things done. It becomes a goal to manage a shower, washing my hair is too much sometimes, and when it's really bad I can't find the energy to even eat. All I can tell you is to find a mantra you can repeat to yourself. Like... It can't get any worse. Or I can do this one thing. Say it over and over. Then clap yourself on the back of you manage it. And don't put yourself down if you don't. Just begin saying then...I can do this one thing tomorrow. I WILL do it. I'm sorry that your friends and family are so discouraging and don't understand or notice you. Unfortunately that's par for the core. That's just part of it. Other people don't get it a

175965105,"_NAME_, You are asking for help -- to get help, one has to look within oneself and discover one's self-worth for himself or herself. That may take some time. Really look deeply into yourself, and find your self-worth and your dignity as a human being. Then one can reach out and ask for help, knowing that one deserves to receive the love and assistance one needs. A professional counselor can help you, but you need to be convinced that you deserve to feel better about your life and your future. I know you can do it; I can hear it in your post, and I believe you know, deep inside you, that you are a good person and worthy of happiness and joy. ""Seek and ye shall find.

There is white privileged when it come to opportunities and a fair trial.
175965126,"That's kinda like me and 'my' schizoid friend Your wording here is priceless. If you decide to write a novel, I hope you remember to include that phrase. So you actually sound fulfilled in many ways. Wow. You are more socially engaged than many! I am rather fond of intensity myself. Yes. I think everyone has a small maximum number of quality connections they can maintain at any time. I've always found work tasks easy if not fun, but work relationships grotesque, horrendous, beyond challenging, nearly insurmountable, untenable, etc. But you have your soul friend... Yes, I'm really grateful for him. He's a fairly extreme schizoid, so there is not only no pressure for physical connection, he barely connects to his own body (so he has said). We have a small, harmonious correspondence, almost like something between a pair of little forest animals, although we discuss some truly extreme shlt.

m South India once said, ""If you think America is bad, everything that you do in triplicate, in India we do in quintuplicate."". Seriously, I sometimes wonder whether we might have gotten habituated to certain neurochemical combinations early in life and cannot feel secure unless the familiar cocktail is nearby. Until one genuinely experiences peace, one might subconsciously prefer the security supplied by re-experiencing (even lousy) moods from childhood. Thank you for making me feel welcome on this forum! Just wanted to stop by to say I'm embarking on a month-long project (possibly longer), thanks to the full tank I've gotten from having been so well-treated here. This is a wonderful forum. I really hope you continue to ride that bucking work 'animal' like a champion! Remember, don't vomit on the bull.

I'm stressed out with my own stuff. I see T on Saturday but I don't really want to. I probably should though. Just want to lay down, snuggle up, and sleep the day away."

175965132,"Hi msstabb. Thanks for opening up a discussion. I’ve struggled with depression on and off for years and was more recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would love to know more about you. How old are you? Are you able to work? What can this community help you with - or are you just wanting to meet people? (me too) Wishing you the best, mellow"
175965133,"Slept good. Woke up at 5, made coffee, took a long walk then took a shower. Going to do laundry later"
175965134,I empathize. When I first started having panic attacks I was stuck in a similar loop. Glad to hear the medication is working.
175965135,"Even though your husband is getting upset with you telling the doctor what is going on, I think it is a good thing and good that it is her presence. This validates your feelings I think. It lets him know that you are having a difficult time with his behavior. And if you did this without him present it may make him feel like you are talking about him behind his back. I am not sure if I am getting the point across properly. With the three of you talking, you are able to say what you feel and you kind of have a referee there to moderate things. It is important that he knows how you feel and how his behavior is effecting you. I think it is a good thing for you. And Like _PERSON_ said, it isn't usual for three people to be in a session. I don't mean to make you think I think that your husband is a bad person, it is the nature of the disease I guess. Manic episodes can be hard to handle or even watch. It is like the person is out of control at times. I think that their minds are going 100 miles an hour. 
Sometimes it can be a good thing, but often not. Sometimes they have control and a lot of times they don't. It is most difficult for the people who love them. I agree with the others, when his medications get sorted out, I think he will be much more lovable. Keep hanging in there, talk to the psychiatrist. Let her know how you feel, even how she makes you feel. Keep it open and keep it real. I think things will get better. Hugs, _NAME_..."

Do you think that the pandemic is effecting you in any way? It is a lot of people right now. I am not sure where you live but for the US it has effected a lot of people with depression and anxiety. I just wondered if it was effecting you too. The times, they are a changing... I hope you feel better soon. Hugs, _NAME_..."

175965144,"Human consciousness.. There could be a greater consciousness.. Like a car crash. It could be an unknown idea creating something into another unknown idea. I feel like there's infinite dimensions. We just have our senses. There's many other senses that we will only be able to sense if we create them.] Eternity is a flash that is nothing long in terms of time, but it must be experienced. It can be considered as heaven or hell depending on where you are in time and space, how you decide to look at it - Based on external or oneness forces that aren't in your control.. But you can control them and identify with them."

175965147,"I understand how this feels. I have been diagnosed with depression for the last 7 or 8 years and every time we find a medication that seems to work, I find that I am allergic to it. All in all, I have tried about 14 different medications a year (not just for depression and anxiety, but for other conditions too) and we are just starting to find the right balance of medications for me. It's hard but it takes a great deal of trial and error. In the mean time I did alot of things that helped me manage my depressive and anxious symptoms a bit better such as always keeping a book on me to read when I needed a distraction or ""scheduling"" time for a hobby each day. I recommend asking your doctor if they can either add a secondary medication for anxiety that you take with your Lexapro, or maybe a different depression medication that works a bit better on it's own for you. I hope you have good luck finding what you need. :)"

175965156,"I haven’t seen The Double. What illness does it cover? It sounds like you’d suggest it? The only movies I can think of offhand that I saw both (oddly) star _NAME_. One is Girl Interrupted, where the main character has BPD and I think _NAME_’s character is suppose to have ASPD. The other movie I saw is Changling, where _NAME_ is institutionalized (and grossly mistreated) because her son was kidnapped and authorities wrongly determine she is mentally ill after they return another boy who is not her son to her. That movie in particular made me really sad to see how patients were treated not so long ago. And obviously think what if I’d been born in another time period"

174355046,"I thought the same. I was depressed so they kept me on an atypical antipsychotic (Geodon) and added a SSRI and I went to manic city. I was up and down having rapid cycles, and since I had that reaction to the SSRI my doc said that bipolar people have that reaction to SSRI's so I must have been bipolar the entire time. My sexual appetite was crazy, I felt depression and mania at the same time."

175965169,"""Dreams do not come true just because you dream them. It's hard work that makes things happen. It's hard work that creates change… Ditch the dream and be a doer, not a dreamer.

His neck muscles are visibly swollen and tied in a huge hard knot. He’s been to the chiropractor 5 times in the last 2 weeks and she finally said it was time to see a medical doc. So he’s going Monday. We’re thinking that huge knot is impeding his nerve going down his left arm because it hurts and loses feeling/strength. I feel so bad for him. He’s never really had neck of back problems so this is all new to him."

175965178,yes I showered today
175965179,"_NAME_, you are correct about the DEA & higher ups being involved. This happened in 2016, they targeted GP's who were prescribing pain medication & benzos was on the hit list too. Patients were told they had to see a psychiatrist & there would be no guarantee if they would get the medication. Some patients were cut off, the lucky ones were given a short supply until they could see a psychiatrist. I am guessing since your GP was planning on retiring he wasn't worried about being flagged for prescribing. I agree, it makes no sense to rx Klonopin but not the other. Everything goes through the prescript ion monitoring program."

175965181,"Work was easy today. I finished a drywall patch. The crazy part of it was that there was a dead beehive that was the cause of the drywall issues. I have never seen that before. All is well though. The coworker I was assigned to work with today told me, while crying, that she gave her 2 week notice this morning. I don't know what to think or feel, except, it made me sad, because I know the stress of changing into a new job. All the uncertainty of working with new collegues and what not. It's a lot of red tape to deal with. I had a ""private selections"" frozen pizza today, it was a veggie one, meh, it was okay but I need to spice it up better next time."
175965182,"Having suffered from 'voices'24/7 for the last five years I have noticed a lot and learned of a great deal of what this thing is and what it seems not to be, of which is written about in other posts, please take into regard that my research is not reliant on the internet, it starts with your own experiences, of the symptoms and of the treatments and listening to your gut. Secondly, attending hearing voices support groups, local town meetings, and volunteering ( some times for dodgy front firms of which I will not divulge for now) Even when studying the youtube groomer phenomenon and fake news scams ( of which seemed to be directed at vulnerable voice hearers) resembled an abuse taking place openly upon accessible networks, Posing as supportive networks independent of toxic meds and illegal investigations, or explainable by chemical imbalances. I concluded with the UN Cyber Torture human rights abuse explanation by _PERSON_. as this is what I see my condition is, ( I get openly/covertly mobbed in pu
blic spaces so this is also evidence of gang stalking, so I am a TI) Anyway, I have noticed that my concentration is not what it was, and I get a lot of brain fog and have some hearing problems, as a result of the exposure, I have momentary tinnitus in one ear like a tonal hum, which sounds like an electronic induced tone, like when you have a hearing test and you have to press the button when you hear the tone being played to you in one ear. Also at times, the 'voices' are very clear and I have sensations upon my head and back of my neck, like a tingling sensation and a tightness on the back of my neck. The V2K is at times quite clear and loud or at normal speaking voice loudness I should say, once I got into a shallow bath and put my head under, to my surprise it amplified the voices and it was like having a phone conversation. So, as I aim to hire an expert to put my theory to the test being aware of their slyness to remain discreet unless in open public feel abused like as in revenge porn cases a few year
s ago. As I still reside trapped and hidden, things that I used to feel emotional about are now reduced to a flattening. old memoirs and feelings. I write these posts as personnel statements as I know a lot of people within my environment know full well what is occurring through are too proud to break the code of secretly. So if I am right and others are in the same boat, this is a testament to being a victim of electronic harassment and organized stalking which is know termed as cyber torture by the UN.

175965186,"Hello everyone, I come seeking advice/personal experiences/etc. I have chosen to quit Cymbalta 30mg cold turkey, as I assumed it was a low enough dose to do so. But I can’t find much information on quitting Cymbalta at such a low dose. I’ve never been on anything stronger, always 30mg once daily, and I’ve been on it for almost a year now. Does anyone have any stories to share? Tips for preparing for withdrawal symptoms? I’m currently just past the 48 hour mark since my last pill. I started noticing mild withdrawal symptoms yesterday that consisted mostly of headache and sweating. Today I’ve had flu-like aches but nothing too bad. My body feels very stiff and achy, and if I move around too much I get fatigued."

175965189,"I've been drunk twice in my life, both back in the summer of 1997. Fortunately for me, I never felt nauseas, and I never threw up. However, both times I couldn't get to sleep until the next morning. Since then, I've chosen not to drink for a number of reasons. One reason is that alcohol is a depressant, like _NAME_ mentioned earlier. And I don't want to deal with depression if I can avoid it."
174355071,"I do sorta keep a rough symptom loog just for me to look over from time to time. I noticed, other than a little blip here and there, a short one occasionally, not even a half a day, I have pretty much been totally free of psychotic stuff since about the third week of May or so. Teensy paranoia,, maybe. Not much. Not freaked about cameras in my walls and stuff. That Trilafon has just totally done the trick for me, for now. I know it can change. Abilify worked for a long time okay, but Trilfaon is in another league entirely for me. A whole other deal. So thankful for this. You know, my lithium kinda stopped working at the same time this all started last October. It is so interesting to me the way our brains seem to change, at least for some of us, that is, over the years and decades. I find it really very fascinating scientifically. What is going on in there? What are those pathways and centers and filters and regulators--what are they doing? Dunno, But I do think it is quite cool purely as a matter 
of sciecne that the human brains state in fully developed adults is capable of such diverse behavior and activity over time. Just very interesting stuff."

175965191,"I haven't read that but I was thinking yesterday, ""Is it easier for addicts to build habits?"" because I find that it's really easy for me to build habits. I do chores every day and make sure that my desk is clean, vacuum my room once a week or so, clothes put away, dishes not left anywhere, hygiene every day, shower every second day, etc.. I'm thinking of maybe doing like 2 things every day instead of like 5-10 every day like I planned.. Just starting slow.. I'll do the chores today and then make another routine - Mostly I want to read and listen to podcasts. Maybe anxiety is getting in the way of that. I can't take a benzo every day so I'd rather have anxiety - That how I stop myself from being dependent or addicted. It's quite hard for me to get addicted to something after having a severe near death experience on the bad trip. I'm not getting dissociative panic attacks anymore which is such a relief. I think they're completely gone. I'll keep that book in mind. I'm quite burnt out. Things will 
get better - I'm just maintaining my mental health with everything going on in my environment. I wish my mom was coping better - She thinks she's going to die or something before age 60 and wants a bf before she looks older. It's all very confusing to me. I think I'll be better by the evening.

175965199,Caffeine is an adenosine agonist (Opposite of melatonin) which indirectly increases dopamine.. That's why I focus much better after drinking a very strong coffee in the morning after the Vyvanse kicks in + nicotine too. Sleep deprivation causes dopamine receptors to be more sensitive? Can have an antidepressant effect but can also cause mania/psychosis. Ketosis agonizes adenosine receptors as well =]

175275689,This is my first post on. And the reason i decided to write is because I'm having anxiety. Or maybe not. But im losing it. The first time i remember having anxiety was in 8th grade( im now a senior in college). And i thought i had health problems. I would spend hours on the internet figuring out what I had. One day I came across a nurse on a form and she told me i had anxiety and after that I don't remember having severe anxiety like that again. Come around corona virus and im losing it. I live in New York City. And i'm an asthma patient. It's been 2 weeks since i left the house. My dad and brother will leave the house but they maintain good hygiene. But im going crazy. On March 12 before the virus was spreading like crazy I went to the ER because I had chest pain. They didnt test me but sent me home with steroids. A few days in and my chest pain didnt stop and i developed ear pain and jaw pain and throat pain and i called my physician she gave me azithromycin and that pain is gone. I havent had a f
ever at all nor a cough. And my family and I keep telling myself if I had corona the whole family would've been infected by now. Someone was bound to show some symptom (fever or cough). But the chest pain doesnt go away .IDK if its because i anxious because sometimes just thinking about it gets me really nervous. I had many emotional breakdowns. My body starts to shake and i've gotten nauseous. My chest pain has not stopped since march 12. I get a acid reflex-y feeling throughout my entire chest area. and sometimes under my armpits and neck i get hot/spicy tingling feelings. My lungs hurt. I can take deep breaths and i check my oxygen levels with a pulse ox and it's above 95 whenever i check. often times my hear rate will be 100-130 . It's been days and my lung pain doesnt go. and pain in the back. sometimes i'll feel spasms in my chest/lung area. Im just really scared and nervous. How do you guys cope with anxiety? I did yoga today for the first time and it didnt do much. Pain is still there. And my lungs wi
ll also feel like they're on fire. all day. I also lost 6 pounds in one week Just looking for words. Idk whats going on with my body either. COVID has be scared. And i dont plan on leaving the house till late summer if i have to. Im just really scared for everyone.

175965212,"You're doing good! Don't worry.. What you're doing is enough and absolutely great! I wish I could get to that point - I'm getting there. Sometimes I feel the way you do and just want to go nuts - That's my main feeling when I want to take 'something' that will make me lose control... It gets us no where. I've spent long years out of control. In the back of our minds, we're always like ""I need to let go and just go straight into the abyss of mental illness"".. But the abyss is hell.. It is also love.. And you can find it with the opposite..."
175965213,"I feel the same way. Loneliness is tough.If anything, maybe your too empathic to others needs. At least that’s what my therapist tells me. I just want to give and never get anything back.

175965223,"Its's good that you wrote back. You said in your latest post, that you had been diagnosed with: “GAD, Panic Disorder and Depression for 8 years now, and just in the past couple weeks it’s spiraled out of control.” And, “My family says it’s 100% my anxiety and they’re not worried at all.” And “It’s getting to the point where I’m at a loss for what to do. I feel rather hopeless.” And “Should this sensation be happening for three days in a row? Is it cause for concern. I’m 20 and in decent health, no real past of any major health problems, but I have severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder so it’s hard for me to tell if it’s anxiety or something I need to go to the hospital for.” As for myself, I have bipolar and have had anxiety attacks. I would wonder, if you’ve been diagnosed it would seem that you have been to a psychiatrist or a mental health center of some kind. Can you go back to that? I went to the net (mayo clinic.org) and one of the things it 
said was, sometimes mental health issues can be inherited. I was having a lot of emotional problems but only realized it was bipolar when a lay counselor told me, “I knew your uncle, and he had manic-depression, and you probably do, too.” So, does anyone in your family have mental health issues? This can sometimes be a tip-off and a help to know that. As to if and when to seek help, I went to the net for panic attacks and the same mayoclinic.org said: “A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Panic attacks can be very frightening. When panic attacks occur, you might think you're losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. “Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition calle
d panic disorder.” “If you have panic attack symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. Panic attacks, while intensely uncomfortable, are not dangerous. But panic attacks are hard to manage on your own, and they may get worse without treatment.” “Symptoms of panic disorder often start in the late teens or early adulthood and affect more women than men.” “Left untreated, panic attacks and panic disorder can affect almost every area of your life. You may be so afraid of having more panic attacks that you live in a constant state of fear, ruining your quality of life.” “A form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you learn, through your own experience, that panic symptoms are not dangerous.” This website, healingwell.com, also recommends CBT in treatment of ailments such as panic disorders, and has a list of readings where it talks about that. This list of resources is found above the list of people, such as yourself, who are writing in about their problems. 
It stresses positive thinking that you can deal with this, which I firmly believe also. This is very important, because I've found that if I go into any problem feeling defeated, it greatly increases the chances that I will be. But if I feel going into the problem that I can solve it, that greatly increases the chances that I will, for I will have programmed myself to be looking for ways to win. The Mayo Clinic website also said there are several medicines that can be used for this condition."
174355116,"They are giving me more students!! argh!! I am going to have a major conniption!! ARRGH!! I need to punch myself out and calm down. I just had the meeting with the head teacher!!

175965224,"My mother who was very loving. She was raised by a cold father who also left her with bruises and other abuses. I watched as she struggled throughout her life trying to deal with her past. She will be 95 years old in January. She ended up getting nowhere, nothing changed for her in all of those years. To this day she still wonders and hurts over why her father did not have love for her. I would think it is time to get mad and say enough is enough. Draw the line for yourself. There is nothing you can do about the past nor your mother at the present. I agree with _NAME_, you can't live your entire life for someone else’s approval. Wise words, indeed. It is not your fault. Letting it ruin your happiness might end up being your fault when all is said and done. My mother is nearing that day. She let much happiness she could have had slip away out of her life. I look at her and think, ""What was it for?"" ""What good did it do?"" I am talking to you at a disadvantage. My mother was good to me. Yet I kn
ow thoroughly the repeated and useless damage she continued to live. Seems to me there is no solution. Only acceptance of what and how things have been and setting yourself free remains. It's time to walk away from this one, you most likely will not win what you want. Maybe someday your mother will surprise you. But waiting for that day to happen is so unfair to yourself. Walk away from the problem and declare it finished. Just who are you supposed to be not good enough for? Everyone? The goal you have set for yourself is monumental! Relax, Everyday, you are good enough for many, many, many people. No one wanting you because you've married three times?? Let that thought go to hell too! I bet you would make a fine catch!!! Look forward to a happy future. You have everything you need to do just that very thing for you. Best Wishes, _PERSON_"

I thought my book was almost done but I’ve only got 20 poems. Need 10 more. At this rate I’m only pushing out 1 poem a day. Give or take a day or a poem. And there was a long string of not writing past month or two due to being depressed and severely anxious. Which I don’t seem to be anymore. Hardly. Slept during the day even after coffee, but only slept 30-45 min compared to sleeping 3-4 hours. I’m getting better I think."

175965231,HUGS _AT_MENTION_ yes this pandemic is hard. And it bites. It's getting tougher the longer it goes. I keep telling myself to take advantage of the time I have off of work (furloughed 40% of the time) and do something that counts but I just watch TV or zone out or do whatever. Nothing meaningful. I think if I could find something meaningful to do it would help me not feel as depressed. I'm just wanting to let you know you aren't alone. I get what you are going through!

175965241,"I've had anxiety for awhile now. I've tried everything to try and feel better. I had some bloodwork done and I'm physically healthy. I went for a mental health assessment. My PCP prescribed meds for anxiety attacks. I usually spend time in nature, socialize, excercise, etc. It still comes in waves throughout the day and is bothersome. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I can't figure out what the trigger is. I just wish it'd ease up some."
175965242,I wake up from a dreamless nap and in a panic that I'm going to die. Death has plage my mind. Now that I'm not in the twilight between sleeping and waking up.
175965243,I feel guilty if I don’t go to the gym though. I use should statements a lot and feel guilty for them. I get what you’re saying though. Should isnt always a bad thing.
175965244,"Maybe. Idk what happens but I can be ok, and then in a split second change my anxiety starts acting up. And It’s usually that I starting panicking and get paranoid. I thought fiancé stopped talking so much in that moment because of something crazy like he’s having an affair or whatever. And then I thought he poisoned the dinner and I was gonna die cuz my stomach was hurting. But I think I ate too much. On that little note, I am actually going to change the way I interact with him. He says I’m mean. Which I’m not, or if I am I don’t mean to. It’s not intentional. He’s quirks and flaws drive me to madness. But they aren’t serious. Only real serious thing is his gaming habits are insane. Like something u read in a news story and then someone died cuz they stayed on for so long playing games. But, even tho that’s the real issue, I don’t actively get mad about that as often versus his quirks. He leaves the cabinet doors open everywhere. He will make food and go upstairs and it looks 
like someone had robbed us of our food because literally... all the cabinets are open. I get onto him about 2 things, Putting things back where they were and throwing away his trash. It hasn’t changed. Ever. But I’m trying to pick and choose my battles. I pick trying to work on spending more time together. Even tho I feel like this shouldn’t be happening this early in the long term relationship. Oh well."

He explained that reality is fake and now what do I do? I have to pretend that it isn't. I want to go back to not knowing my perception that it is fake - It's completely real for anyone else and if I was someone else, that's where I want to be - With time and change. There's such terrible unaware people. And I'm kind of lured my Satan. I'm kind of possessed by Satan.. Maybe.. The cynic philosopher is Satanic. I can't help myself. I try so hard.

175965255,"A loved one diagnosed with schizophrenia (definitely has had many bouts of serious psychosis that caused job loss, being kicked out of the house, being committed involuntary, etc), does not currently think there is anything wrong with them. They were allowed home in the Spring of this year because they promised to get treatment but eventually stopped (something happened with the psychiatrist, we suspect the PDoc wanted to get rid of the patient but do not have access to this kind of data--the office suddenly stopped giving shots and instead sent the shots home). Is this possible they think they are fine? Or are they just afraid to admit to having a problem due to trust issues? They would be forced to get a shot and then seem to be OK for longer than the 30 days the shot lasts but then eventually start acting in strange (IMO) or scary ways. Sometimes when they get to this point, none of us feel safe alone with them. After getting the shot, they once again get a job offers or jobs but it never lasts 
since they do not think they need any medical help. It seems like they are getting worse and worse each time they fall into instability. They won't apply for any kind of help so they have no medical insurance so when they are committed as incompetent, they are released three days later because the medication temporarily makes them competent again. They are unable to take care of themselves. I am currently paying for a hotel and their food (a family member will not let them come back because of fear) but am limited in how much I can provide. When they were living at home I observed that without medication--if they were not under any stress, they weren't that psychotic but also weren't very productive. IMO each time they went into ""scary"" psychosis was associated with extreme stress. It has been hard to watch but not as hard as it was since I now realize I can only do so much. How do you help someone like this other than continuing to commit them each time they become a danger to themselves or others? Though 
they are still under the influence of medication--I am not able to convince them of anything. They will take my money and the things it pays for (shelter, food, clothing) but insist on living their life their way."

A checklist off of an article I read on how to beat pandemic fatigue has been really helpful. Some things that have helped is where it says to: Stay connected with family and friends. Even if it's just texting silly memes and GIFs, having Zoom meetings and gatherings, playing games with each other online. Making the best of circumstances. Since we can't hurry the pandemic along, we have done a lot of house projects that have made it feel more cozy and functional and helps our enjoyment of our space. Sticking to a routine as mentioned above. Meditation, prayer. Having quiet time with a cup of coffee and just looking or stepping out into the garden or sitting in the sunshine is so calming.

Don't go around people that aren't wearing them. Take things one day at a time. Try to stay calm in your daughter's presence.

174355217,I told one of my coworkers that I am schizoaffective yesterday. It went really well. She said she would have never known. It was fairly low risk as this person works in our overseas facility. We were talking on Skype. She says I am doing really well. It was nice. She said she would have thought anxiety from some of my Facebook posts but that is about it. Maybe I come off as more stable than I feel sometimes?

175965311,"I certainly feel higher level of anxiety in the morning. Pretty much every morning. Like the OP, I find that it usually dissipates -- at least to some extent -- when I get up and going. But sometimes it is hard to get up and going... Some have said the morning anxiety is a result of higher cortisol levels -- that cortisol levels are cyclical throughout the day, and tend to be highest in the morning. I once asked a doctor whether I should do one of the 24 hour cortisol level tests, to see whether I have super high cortisol levels in the morning. He said there's no point - not much can be done about it anyway. When I first started taking my SSRI (Zoloft), I woke up every day, very early, like 5 or 530 am, with an extremely high level of agitation. It burned off but only after I went out for a run. Pretty unpleasant running, exhausted, at that hour. I wondered why this happened only in the early mornings. In any event it stopped happening after a month or 6 weeks maybe.

Not eating enough or forcing yourself to eat, and not enjoying favourite foods are some symptoms, although it could be something totally different! I've never asked a professional or even talked to my family about my disorder. I know it's there, and recently it's gotten worse. The symptoms I have is seeing myself as fat when I'm told the opposite, feeling like I have to lose weight, having a rather unrealistic weight goal, and forcing myself to not eat my cravings just to name a few. I don't think it works for those outside of the US, sorry I didn't realize you weren't from the US! That's just what I use. What country are you from - I could look into a crisis textline for you.

175965342,"I've struggled with being faithful in every single relationship I've been in. I actually lost a really great relationship with someone I loved deeply because I was unfaithful. Everything was perfect but my bipolar was out of control. It's been over a year since the end of that relationship and I've realized that a lot of my inability to stay faithful was because I didn't believe I deserved something so good and I also didn't fully know what I wanted long term. I didn't understand my own worth and the attention of someone, anyone else determined my worth since I couldn't determine it for myself. I needed the attention because it made me feel like I meant something. Even though I was getting attention from my significant other, I needed more the worse I felt. When I worked on myself and valued myself, found myself worthy of good things, I realized I could disconnect from those unhealthy relationships and people and say no to certain situations. No matter how badly I may have wanted it, I was able to 
say no and choose the better options. I don't know if this helps you, but I wanted to at least share my experience in the hopes it does help. Promiscuity and impulsive desires are a part of bipolar, unfortunately. But building up your emotional independence and working on not being codependent will help you be in more control of those choices and to be a better partner."

175965410,"Dear,borderlinemom. Unfortunately I don't know your name, but I hope now you are doing better. I can't imagine how hard it is for you, yet I know how does it feel when you are depressed and lonely. First what you have to think of, loneliness is just a feeling, an illuzion what our brain seems to like to believe in. Its an illuzion, if you will open your eyes and look around you can see your children playing. They love you. Deeply care about you. Even if it does not seem like it. I don't know you but I love you too. And I want you to feel good, relaxed. Open a window and look outside, breath in and out a fresh air, even if the weather is bad and its raining, the put your palm out and touch the water drops. You are not alone, we all aren't. We just think of this way because maybe physically there is no one around. But its easy to change. Call your old friends, or family members. Go even on a live chatting platfrom where you can talk with bunch of strangers and they will share their thoughts and suppo
rt to you. There is always something good about each day. If you feel bad, don't hold it in yourself. You can cry, scream and then breath in and out and do what you thinks is right for your wellbeing and that won;t harm your health or anyothers. Take care of yourself and best wishes!"

Write about your day, your goals, positive affirmations, reroute your thinking and keep yourself grounded. THIS WILL PASS!! I myself am going through a bit of a uneasy night. But I always tell myself, “if you can make it through the night there’s a brighter day”... if you don’t mind me asking, what is your “anxiety type”? We all suffer from different forms.

Also, did those religious folk, who basically believed any sex instincts were devil, accept his (now frowned upon) theory of psychosexual development?

175275798,"I'm a single mother with two children, ages 7 and 12, I've had asthma induced anxiety since I was a child, and started having non-asthma panic attacks five years ago when my ex started to cheat and make things very difficult. We got divorced, i got sole custody of our kids, he left everything to me so he could move to a different state and be with his mistress (wife 3), including a house that was falling apart and his 16 year old daughter from his first marriage. _USER_ID_ issue #1 - Issues with Doctors I've done my best to manage my anxiety and panic, but I have not been able to find a doctor who understands the breathing part of this (from asthma) and how to address the fact that I can't absorb (or absorb properly) most of these medications. I've been on so many different medications, none of them work, they often just make me feel even worse. But these doctors won't listen to me, they get offended when I try to suggest a study or medication. I've had to do my own research because I can't find a 
doctor who knows how to treat me. They're so cruel about it too. They'll tell you that you have to make an appointment to speak to the doctor, that they can't say over the phone whether the doctor will treat you, so I go, the doctor comes in and usually tells me that they can't do what I'm asking them to do, and I still get a bill for that visit. but I can't go to see any new doctors or therapists, see Issue #3 - Fighting for Custody"

How worried should I be about her hurting the kids considering she’s talked about suicide. Since moving out, I have become severely depressed and have been on meds for a little over a week now and have been seeing a therapist.

If possible getting on lower doses of your meds might help too. Getting a hobby can give you something to do and might give you motivation. Start small and slowly work up your energy levels. Nothing will overnight fix things but if you take it slow and try to push through the tiredness a bit each day I think you'll feel better. Games that make you think like crosswords or word searches or even card games can be good to train your brain too. Hope you feel better soon."""

175965462,"Was just talking to fiancé about this morning when I asked him to come back home to help me. But he didn’t want to miss work. I told him I was in so much pain and I almost fell down the stairs dragging myself to the car at 4am to goto the ER. When I called my dad right before, I told him I was upset that fiancé wanted to goto work/needed to, instead of helping me and my dad told me I don’t understand and that he needs to goto work. That hurt me in my heart. I was telling fiancé that every emergency I’ve had my dad hasn’t missed a day of work over. Which has crushed me in the past because I almost died from *sui* and he still didn’t miss work. Not by choice but by not wanting to get fired. _PERSON_ is like my dad in every single way, unfortunately and yet good I GUESS... I was crushed this morning by fiancé. My dad was gonna come up but I told him not to, that’d I’d just take myself... I had told fiancé maybe a 2 weeks ago that I have abandonment issues. My dad worked 3 jobs when 
I was a kid and I only saw him on the weekends. My mom actively didnt pay attention to me and left my dad when I was 14. Just up and didn’t come back. I didn’t hear from her for 3/4 years after that. Didn’t know where she went. Like I literally woke up to goto school and she had left in the middle of the night. That and other scenarios with them and other non-family/friends is why I get so upset about people not talking to me on a regular basis. I’m afraid they are not wanting me around anymore, don’t care about me, and want nothing to do with me."

175965469,So sorry about your new GP....I have one that is the same. When ever I mention xanax and I'm never asking for a prescript ion she says she would never prescribe it for me because they are very addictive and a narcotic? Well my GYNO has prescribed them for me yearly since my first panic attack when my 2nd born was a couple months old. Just having them in my purse helps prevent them and if I feel like I need one I start with 1/2 of the .5 I'm prescribed. He gives me 1 refill which I've never needed. I don't even take all 30 of the first bottle. My 2nd born is now 31! I don't bother telling her because I don't need anything from her and she has her own mindset. However- I need my xanax from time to time- some times more; some times less.

We have know since January this was coming and to have done nothing to prepare says volumes about us. Still I want to commend the healthcare workers for the job they are doing. On another sad note it is disgusting the way hospitals are handling this from a PR standpoint. They are firing drs and nurses who plead for more PPE. Also stories are circulating in which nurses are being evicted by landlords because of their close contact with the virus. My wife and I are making masks for the hospitals in our area now. We are part of a quilt guild so we have many people skilled in making things such as this. They are asking for help and it does my heart good to help where I can.

175965478,"Since you're all on antipsychotics and like dopaminergic hits, I was gonna treat myself with phenibut-stimulant tomorrow after I get a good sleep tonight and be productive etc, I took them today. So they just have to kick in. I've been feeling really unmotivated today even. I went to bed early to avoid life and I couldn't sleep because of possible phenibut withdrawal... So I took 3x 1/2 zopiclone, 2x 1/2 clonazepam and one alprazolam. I can't keep doing this. I wish there was something prescribed that my psychiatrist or doctor could prescribe for me long term (2-5 years) to increase focus and mood. That's why I might try microdosing psychedelic. It has negative side effects though such as depersonalization, worsening of OCD and anxiety, uncomfortable physical irritability etc.. So I'm gonna talk about all of this stuff when I see my psychiatrist on the 21st. He's a really good psychiatrist - Best I've ever met.

175965488,"Taking over a year to use up the equivalent of 40 doses of Xanax is exemplary use _USER_ID_, your doctor freaking out probably either means she suspects you're doctor shopping and getting prescript ions from others, this is a big problem with opiates, in which case you should probably fire her because a doctor who thinks you're lying is dangerous, or the local legal situation has gotten so bad she's worried about losing her license, which would also mean she couldn't continue to help you and others. As others have recommended, get a refill from a psychiatrist. Since Xanax has worked so well for you, there's no reason to change to another. about Klonopin and other benzodiazepines, my experience from using them on and off for 25 years, plus what I've researched, is that they're pretty much all the same in terms of hitting the biological target (which is also roughly the same as the Z-drugs like Ambien), which particular one is best is based on how they act in the body, like how fast they take effect 
(the faster, the more addiction potential), how long they last, and how your body removes them, which has potential for interactions with other drugs. I was started on Ativan, but I cleared it from my body too quickly getting withdrawal symptoms before the normal 8 hours were up, so I was changed to Klonopin, which has a much longer half-life. Withdrawing from it is more than obnoxious, although not quite ""hell"" for me, what I've done is to do it very slowly, taking at least 3 weeks for each dosage reduction, 2 weeks that are not fun, and another to recover, the whole process taking many months if starting from my max of 0.5 mg 3 times a day. One problem is that it's a potent drug, with the lowest tablet of 0.5 mg way too much unless you're good with an Xacto knife, or your doctor switches you to another benzodiazepine with lower effective dosages in the smaller pills. And when I say ""good"", at minimum I need to divide a single tablet into sixths for the last few steps. And the above and what other people 
are saying emphasizes that if possible, you should take these drugs as seldom as you can like you do, take a steady dosage over 2-3 weeks and your body will get adapted to them, which you could say is form of addiction."

A few days ago I made myself sit down and figure out how to use my cell phone, which I don't use I just want to know who to use it in case I have to. You did well to reach a forum for assistance. You mentioned bad experiences so on the net I looked up Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I don’t know that you have that, I don’t have any such training, I just have Bipolar for which I take Lithium stabilizer (600 mg) and Mirtazapine anti-depressant (7.5 mg). I typed PTSD into the search engine and one of them was “Anxiety and Depression Association of America” (adaa.org). It said: “PTSD is diagnosed after a person experiences symptoms for at least one month following a traumatic event. However symptoms may not appear until several months or even years later. The disorder is characterized by three main types of symptoms: • Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive distressing recollections of the event, flas
hbacks, and nightmares. • Emotional numbness and avoidance of places, people, and activities that are reminders of the trauma. • Increased arousal such as difficulty sleeping and concentrating, feeling jumpy, and being easily irritated and angered. Do you have any of those? WebMd.com said: ""Several types of drugs affect the chemistry in your brain related to fear and anxiety, including: • Fluoxetine (Prozac) • Paroxetine (Paxil) • Sertraline (Zoloft) • Venlafaxine (Effexor) The FDA has approved only paroxetine and sertraline for treating PTSD."" • One of the treatments webmd.com said was Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) which this website, healingwell.com., advocates. You can find that under ""Bipolar Resources"" which is above the list of names of people who have written in on the opening page of the ""Bipolar"" forum. It is simply a matter of feeling positive that you can solve problems, including those involving health. In that, if you think you can solve a problem before going into it and 
before actually trying to solve it, you believe that you can solve it. It improves your chances for solving the problem, for your mind looks for ways to solve it, rather than closing down your mind’s search for solutions because you don't believe you can solve it. So do you believe you can solve this?"

It has been my observation that those who are socially and emotionally independent of others; family, relationships etc... are faring better during covid-19. I watched a couple today and noted their boredom with each other; their taking for granted of each other, and was thankful I am no longer in a relationship where every fibre of one's being has to be compromised , however little , by the constant presence of another. Basically, I think we are not 'social' animals in the true sense of the word in todays world. We have a preconceived idea that we are, based on historical and habitual behaviour but today it is a need borne from boredom, loneliness etc because we cannot handle being alone, when in fact this is what we need to cultivate. ie. being alone and happy with that. We can feel Love, compassion for others energetically without the need for the fake 
pretenses and the use of drugs/alcohol to engage in traditions we should have left behind long ago. But perhaps some psychedelic therapy would alter my harsh views; make me less misanthropic and therefore less inclined to adopt views that are pertinent to my own personality."

175965524,"I think I’m someone who is not as patient with technology as I used to be. I don’t like movies or stuff to watch to begin with. Like I feel like I wanna read or listen to music or play a game. Which is why l get stuck on gaming sometimes cuz it actually lets me interact with the computer or console and not just sit there, like watching YouTube videos. I hate watching YouTube. I always feel restless. I been like that my whole life. Like lecturing in college and high school, I zone out. I can’t help it. I remember being a kid and having dvds where you could put them in the computer. And I always played the interactive stuff over watching the movie. Sometimes I’d beg my parents to buy the interactive version of the dvd even if we already had the dvd."

It's such a big production, mostly geared towards getting the most money possible, but is not the way i would do it if I was in charge. It's very difficult for me right now, my sister is the worst kind of perfectionist, right down to a drop of coffee on the counter. I am basically a neat person but not a nut for cleanliness. As usual, I don't argue with my sister because that would turn into a big fight. I'm trying to take it one day at a time, and know it will get easier as time goes on and i learn the rules. I was told by a therapist that I hate criticism, I think this is because my mom was also a perfectionist and threatened us with being hit by her yardstick if we gave her ""any guff"". Of course that was a long time ago, but I think that has left me passive-aggressive. I get back at my sister for her perfectionism by not following the rules 100%.

I found a lot of good tips. Of course there's the timer thing where you set it for 15-20 minutes to work on something. Then there's another thing I found helpful, instead of doing ALL the cleaning one day of the week, do 40 minutes or so like 3 times a week and throughout that everything gets done and it's less overwhelming. And of course tidying up here and there whenever you can, like picking up a mug when you see it and bringing it to the sink instead of passing it by. Just little things like that all add up. I'm staying mindful, in the present moment. My family and friends are healthy and happy, so I'm grateful and happy to be alive.

I did sometimes take one benzo to calm but was mostly saving them for derealization panic attacks (Seeing things too close, far away, too big or too small). I ended up taking one every evening because my dad was here and acts weird when I'm not well. Now I'm a little tolerant and if I half it, I can't sleep. Need a longer acting one. Yeah so far I've been setting my alarm for 10:00am-10:30am and being ready by noon after I've had a coffee, etc... So by around the afternoon, that's when I'm the most awake and focused and mentally well and can do things. I just got a planner called ""Evernote"". Last week I spent time transferring my notes to it from apple notes for 6 hours straight. Now I feel the novelty I guess and feel like I accomplished something... So I have to work on it more like what to say to doctor, my improvements, plan

Or pretended to be a referral only site till I convinced him I knew better, and he then pretended he accidentally made that mistake. The majority tho, they did not stay with me until my haunting emotions deescalated. Time was up after 25 - 30 min, and they would disconnect me, leaving me to feel even worse because I was now becoming a bother to crisis and emotional support hotlines???!!

She will go on medication for a bit & seem to do good & then decides there is nothing wrong with her, the drs & everyone around her is lying. It has been a viscous & destructive cycle all these years. As you mentioned you have your illnesses to deal with, you dread taking calls or answering text messages some days. I would listen closely to my inner feelings. What happens to you if you decide to move & once there you see that you shouldn't have? How will this affect you, loss of a job, a place to live things of this nature. Maybe even sit down & make a list of pros & cons.

I'm scared when he has to go but then I think about all the stuff I have to deal with, with his other children and i want nothing to do with them. They've never been in my life or helped me with nothing. Never so much as really talked to me or gave me the time of day. And I have tried to reach out to them multiple times and either they dont answer their phone or dont text back or whatever. One of them, my half sister, changes her number really often and has a different facebook every month or so. I had like 6 of her profiles added, but I deleted them some time ago. Shes been and continues to be in and out of jail. I see her children smoking pot and drinking on snapchat everyday. My half brother has said some not so nice things about me. I think he was ready to beat me up when I got real sick 5 years ago. I had told him i didnt consider him my brother because i dont even know him. L
ife is just getting bleaker for me. But its depressing because I know it could be worse but this is a low I havent experienced since I was sick. And it's a different kind of low. This depression has me feeling numb. And I'm not sure what to think about my relationship right now so it's hard to be there for fiance with his dad. I just am numb to him because the relationship hasn't been it's best since we moved in. Like it had its ups during this time but the lows really make me think about everything. And I have this job interview coming up and I just am not ready and I almost dont even want it anymore. But then if I dont get it I think I may move back to my dads. Which now feels like an optimistic departure. But at the same time I know I would go downhill. I already know. I'd have to go back to my clinic where I've had problems, a lot of them, with the services, doctors, and therapists. I could get a job yea but the ease of commuting wouldnt be an ease. Id have to go very far. Maybe 30 min to an hour out to w
ork everyday. And just overall, I'd be stuck in that house again and my dad would always be at work, or sleeping on his days off. We would never really do anything together because he would always be busy. So I'd be in my head and probably just let everything fall to the wayside like always. It just really sucks right now. And the worst part is, everyone I've reached out to just doesnt text or call me back. With the exception of my dad, SP, and findingreason. I've only reached out to people I trust and pretty much everyone is so darn busy in their own lives that its inconvenient I guess to lend support. I had even reached out to fiances mom. I cried to her and opened up about my feelings and how to best help fiance through everything and try to better the relationship. _PERSON_ said she said she didnt want to be in the middle of anything and then he said I shouldn't call her again. Which I felt betrayed because I opened up to her. Never said anything about my problems, only asked how could I help fiance. But 
whatever, it's her son. Idc."

Yes, SHE actually warned me REPEATEDLY that I should not get involved with her because of her terrible temper and that she would bring me nothing but misery. I didn't listen. I was crazy in love. Looking back, there were numerous red flags that I ignored. I recall numerous parties where we had to leave early because of some minor irritation. She would pull me aside and whisper to me through clenched teeth : "" I'm getting heated! You have to get me out of here NOW before I lose my temper!! "" ... she was smiling on the outside but fuming on the inside. At the time, I thought that these things happened just once in a while because I was in love and put her on a pedestal and minimized her faults. Looking back, these things did not happen just once in a while but pretty regularly. Looking back, she cancelled more than half our dates at the last minute, even when we were already engaged, tellin
g me that she was "" so irritable that she could not stand herself "" and that it was ""not safe"" for me to be anywhere near her. I ignored the warning signs and I ignored her warnings and now I'm walking on eggshells terrified of her temper and the violent rages she flies into at the drop of a hat."

175965616,"Today is World Suicide Prevention Day. I have many conflicting feelings about what this word ‘suicide’ stands for and I will share them with you in this post. You may agree disagree and I hope you will comment as you see fit. As many of you, dear readers, already know my story, I am going to share some of it again in hopes that it might help someone else. A little over a decade ago I had my first suicide attempt in California. It was bad. I was taken to the emergency room late at night and ended up in intensive care. I really do not remember much. After that I went to the psych ward for a three day hold. A three day hold is customary if a person tries to kill him or herself. It gives the person a chance to stabilize. At the end of that period if everyone, being the case worker and psychiatrist and perhaps others, agrees then a judge rules if you go home or if you stay in the hospital. I was allowed to leave, partly because my parents had made arrangements to see a psychiatrist and therapist bac
k in Oklahoma where I would resume living with them. It was in Oklahoma that I first learned I had an illness called bipolar disorder. Before that, I’d never heard of it. My next attempt in Oklahoma was not as dramatic as my first, but it did require another emergency room visit, stitches, and the hospital psychologist. I had to stay in the psych ward, but this time it was for a longer period – five days. It was miserable there. No real therapy. Horrible food for the vegetarian I was at the time. But at least there was a visiting hour. My mom came every evening. Same kind of escape deal, the judge and all that. I remember as we left, looking out the window to the thirteenth floor of the hospital where I had stayed and was so happy to be out and free. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/being-bipolar/2019/09/10/world-suicide-prevention-day-2019/"

175965628,"The obese sow who used to live down the street (I've seldom been happier to see people move away.) once remarked to child-free me very pointedly, ""I could never have an abortion. I don't see how anyone could (LONG pause watching my face)"". I simply didn't react. At all. The beauty of such situations is that I've never been pregnant, and have only wanted children for a maximum total of 5 minutes my entire life ( high estimate). That oceanic sow was the second woman who beat around the bush trying to figure out if I'd ever had an abortion (no idea why anyone would want to spend their time that way). The first, a hardcore Catholic control freak who was wont to loudly proclaim that, ""Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Light...."", referred to a ""D and C"" in conversation. I had to ask her what that was and she explained about dilation and curettage ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_and_curettage ). Women can be real cvnts about abortion. They bring the subject up out of the blue and watch 
my face intently , like hyaenas (no offense to that species). I can't act to save my life, and it thrills me to crush their empty-life parasitic curiosity. You won't be suckin' my blood today, bltch. Why personal relationships and reproduction are anyone else's business (unless they've been asked for their opinion) is beyond me. I think most people are mentally stagnant and juicy gossip is all they have to excite themselves. Sick. I'll go for the jugular if it's online, but just do a stoneface if it's in real life, as I'm very short and people just end up chuckling ( https://i.imgur.com/F7pmO4M.gif )."

175965647,I don't think scapegoating and harassment is schizophrenia. I think someone could be deluded into thinking that they have schizophrenia if they are undergoing that kind of torture. But I don't think it can cause schizophrenia. I think schizophrenia is a genetic and or brain disease that we still don't know enough about. Now if you are asking if people with schizophrenia are easier targets for this kind of torture then I don't know. I have schizoaffective disorder and I think I am neither more or less of a target than anyone else. I still think I'm smart and have my wits about me most of the time.

All it takes is one person to walk with You, beside you, and fight for you even when you can’t fight for yourself. My goal is to pass it on forward to the next searching soul and be the light. The problem is medication only gets you so far before you realize you must go back to the beginning and learn to love who is inside of you. Sit with how you feel, learn to cope with your own personal struggles and work with them, not against them. If you are interested in working on starting a zoom meeting that people can come and go freely where they can openly talk about how they are feeling and what it is they need for support to get through this tough time. Let me know."

175965651,"Hello! I'm so sorry to hear that you are afraid of dying and chest pains. Last year during Christmas I had a random though that I would die in my sleep. I used to stay up so late. Then when this summer began and school let out, I was going on a three week trip to California. I had so much chest pain and palpitations that I thought for sure that I would have a cardiac arrest (luckily it was just from a cold). But as soon as I went on vacation, my worry was gone. I know how hard it is to live with anxiety, I've had it for 5 years. From fear of throwing up that caused me to practically starve myself for 2 years to countless sleepless nights huddled in fear. Im still dealing with it and have had 7 panic attacks between these last two days because of a dream. I know how it feels for people to tell you to forget about it. I hate it. So instead of telling you to let it go, just keep yourself busy. Make millions of friendship bracelets, teach yourself to knit, volunteer at a humane society. Make it so you 
head has no time to think about fear. One thing I would recommend for your anniversary is to go to an amusement park, if you guys enjoy that stuff. Trust me, the only thing you'll worry about is if you get to keep riding the roller coasters. If that not your thing, maybe hike to waterfall and have a picnic. Take many beautiful pictures and try to identify all of the wildflowers. I will he praying for you. May God bless you and protect and give you strength."

175965655,_PERSON_ I have helped a friend when they lost touch with reality and they ended up in hospital which was safest place for them. The hospital is a place that they can try meds and keep close tabs on patients. They also have other treatment options. I am relieved you are seeing doctor. Admitting gives them time to work with your wife to get them stable and it may just be the vacation you need to get back to some kind of normal and take care of your self care needs and the needs of your children. Hoping for the best outcome.
175965656,"Yes, there's nothing like a long brisk walk when you feel anxious. I used to walk every morning while I was working."
175965657,I took my night meds last night around 9 PM and my morning meds this morning around 5:30 AM. I almost forgot two but I remembered them.
175965658,"I respect the ability of some people to tell the truth in an empathetic way. There's an art therein that is a step above ""brutal"" honesty. Not all honesty has to be brutal. Some people arm themselves with honesty in a malicious way that undoes the potential for good that comes from the truth. I prefer people who are honest, but at the same time, it's so easy to read people's body language and predict behaviour patterns, that people who outright lie and manipulate seem to be playing a children's game poorly. Sometimes I feel pity for them."

It's not as poorly worded as that. But I remember. Rarely I want things these days. I often said that I don't want things anymore... But that's not enlightenment.. I spent a lot of money on research chemicals when I was 19. It was a year of destruction - There was nothing like it. The bitcoins that I spent would be worth 1.38 million now. Now I'm reading PiHKAL and other books about pharmacology and cryptography.. Now is a much better time. I'm safe and cautious. I've matured - Although still a bit excited about things. I think I'll mainly focus on cryptocurrencies/stock market and neuro/psycho/pharmacology and then choose my 3rd thing at the end of the day which would be out of multiple things.

174355725,"Hi Nikki, I am not bi-polar, or haven't been diagnosed as such, though I can be rather moody. So who knows? Right? I do have clinical depression. I just don't want you to feel guilt over past mistakes. That is how we learn much of the time. I myself was going over past mistakes in my mind today and it was making me depressed. Luckily I noticed it and I changed my way of thinking. Got myself busy. It does no good to worry about the past. You are a different person now, you are getting help and trying. Don't beat yourself up. Remember you are a good person. My mother was called ""manic depressive"" which is called bi-polar now. She was also paranoid schizophrenic. She was hospitalized a few times and for a long time. I can understand you wanting to bring awareness of this type of mental illness. People don't choose to be this way, they are born this way. Or with the gene. Same with diabetes. I have it on both sides of my family so I was bound to get it and I did. Take some of your ideas and make it r

Based on genetics, (early) life experiences and how one generally relates/reacts to the world around them, I'd say many many comorbid disorders are possible. We're all snowflakes. I'm also guessing that SPD and the autism spectrum can be easily confused by lazy, stupid doctors, or which there are more than a few. SPD is supposedly rare, so I'd guess it's much less common in prison populations than other disorders."

174355757,"Thank you everyone who has replied so far. I've been busy figuring some things out personally and dealing with the inanities of quotidian existence and haven't had an opportunity to respond to you all. I have a bit of time this morning and I'm in a good place so I'll try and address some of the awesome responses this thread has generated so far. Not sure what order makes the best sense to respond to.. This'll be a long post and formatting may get weird... Bare with me Thank you for your kind words Cholls and I'm glad my post sparked some insights for you. The work your friend is doing / the approach she is developing / developed sounds really interesting. If you have a link I'd love to look it over. The situation you described where you had her repeat a question about your father twice sounds like maybe an internal defense you're fighting against. Asking her to repeat the question could be the defense that gives you time to think up a safe answer. ((I know that for me when I'm asked a question that 
may reveal ""secrets"" I deflect the question. For example I'm not really comfortable talking about my intentions or goals (and lack thereof), it feels like I'm giving away secrets. So if somebody asked me ""So, OutsideIn what do you want to do after you finish schooling?"" it depends if I'll need to interact with them again but usually I'll either slip on my happy mask to create an elaborate tableau that goes way beyond their question's scope and prevent further inquiries. Sort of like describing your dream house to somebody... I don't really know why I'm going to school except that I'm smart and it seems like a good way to fill my time before I kill myself. (Not a good thing to say in person) )) My father is a narcissist and I have tried to take him to task for his behavior, so to speak. So I totally know how frustrating that is. I stopped doing it because it never seemed to 'take' his behavior has never changed and I didn't feel any better afterwards. It made me wonder like how can he be this way? This per
son helped create me but only thinks of himself and treats me like an object. I'm a psychology student (and also really into nonverbal behavior) so I see in his reactions all the defensiveness he exerts to maintain control. It is like fighting a defense mechanism and like me and giving away information it seems involuntary. The theory that this isn't SPD specific and more a universal mental health seems very true to me to a certain extent anyways.. personality disorders and other psychological disorders not stemming from physiological abnormalities (brain and other organ functioning) can be thought through with techniques like your friend is working on. The key to helping folks in this category is deep introspection and consideration of how the illness affects your life and tackling the ""problems"" one at a time. Other mental illnesses that come from abnormal brain chemistry / structures like schizophrenia or depression (via shrunken hippocampus) don't really apply but they'd still benefit from the approach. 
I think we're in the same boat Eldror... or at least in the same ocean. Practice makes better and since writing my original post I've been to therapy every week and have been embracing those moments where I feel like the real self even though they're awkward. I think it's helping and in my day to day I'm masked less. I'm pretty mentally drained from the effort by the end of the day but it's sort of like exercising my real self. Oblivion your post gave me a lot to think about. Like the fact that I was considering it as a problem to be solved gave me pause. I had to consider whether or not the way I handle interactions was something I wanted to change or not and what I wanted to change about it. Changing my thinking about my psyche (who I am, how I am) from considering it as one unit to a way more like partitions in a computer allowed me to tweak a things and accept more of how I am in general. Your post was especially helpful. Thank you I'm still active and will have more time for responses later. Lets keep ta

175965756,"I experienced psychosis in my mid twenties. During that time I became very paranoid. It felt like I was being watched through the TV, web camera and magazines. Any photo with eyes would stare back at me and it was a very penetrating stare. My privacy was gone, including what I was thinking. Everything about me the public could see and hear. The world was grey and cold. The bottom half was red. The North Koreans were taking over the world and I was the only one who knew. Gradually I felt like I was being pursued, because I knew this was happening. This information was being communicated to me through magazines and the TV. It was also revealed in my dreams. This experience was torture. It made me very anxious. The agitation I had was also bad. At times it got severe that I would just walk around the city at night for hours and hours, just so I wouldn't violently explode. One time I walked by a hospital and thought about going to Emergency but didn't, because 5 years previously, I had a traumatic psyc
hiatric experience. I was misdiagnosed with BPD and accused of attention seeking. I wasn't going to submit myself to that again, so I walked past the place. - I got treated thanks to a social worker. The Zyprexa started to clear my thinking within 3 days. For years I was was sort of ashamed of this experience. I never really discussed it in depth until recently with my psychiatrist, who wasn't treating me at that time."

175965758,"Minipuff: It’s like getting a Christmas present hearing from you. You present the most gosh awful of situations, people try to help you, then you give a short reply, then we don’t hear from you. It’s like the parent worried about the child for leaving them in the lurch about how they are doing. You don’t know how excruciating that is. It’s like bad news is better than no news. I’ve been in situations like that. Does your ego strength get very low when times are tough? And you can’t reach out or respond? That’s what happens to me when I’m low. I use to have anxiety attacks, from Dr. _PERSON_. I came in as depressed, and instead of wondering if I had mania, also, as in bipolar, which I do, he simply diagnosed me as depressed and gave me an anti-depressant. Without a stabilizer like Lithium, which I’m now on to slow down the anti-depressant Mirtazapine, I started having panic attacks. So I’m wondering when did your panic attacks start? Did they start with a medicine, but then I s
houldn’t ask you that? Did they start with a lot of anxiety? Web.md said, before you start taking Prozac, tell your doctor if you have a personal or family history of bipolar. Do you have bipolar? Symptoms are racing mind, coming up with more ideas than you have the energy or time to carry out, staying up late. Net says Prozac also treats depression in addition to anxiety. You need to check everything with your psychiatrist. Are you generally positive that you can get through this, for I found out that my thinking can influence the outcome? I was very negative and a lot of things did turn out that way. As for sleep, I take Melatonin, along with my regular meds."

175965760,"The vape store owner claimed that someone from MA came and bought up his whole stock of disposables. I don't know about that, but he was out of them (the illegal ones). He sold my friend a Juul knock off I never heard of before, that looks like it produces a lot of vapor. So I'm thinking it won't work for my purposes but I'd rather have it than not. He was so sweet today. He brought me a long stemmed rose, it's gorgeous. And my other friend (besides my bestest) who kicked me out of his life 10 years ago reportedly said he forgives me and let me decide if I want to write to him, which I do. I'm guessing my bf told him about my diagnoses. So, I have mixed feelings about all that. I guess my friend knows I'm in a nursing home too."

175965794,"Hey _NAME_, I hope you are getting by just fine. My advice to you is that do not get sad over the time that you have lost and try to live your today to the fullest. We can be our own worst critics and the judgment we pass on ourselves can sometimes belittle our spirits and I believe you are doing the same to yourself. If your criticism isn't making you grow and e productive then you are just harming yourself. My advice to you would be that it is okay to not get something done the entire day, start small. Clean the space around you, get those summer clothes out and give them away to charity and also take out some winter stuff to donate to people in need. Make yourself laugh and your family laugh, you are really young sweetheart don't be so critical of yourself. I would also advise that get yourself an emotional support animal that will keep you busy and will not pass any judgment on you and the unconditional love and support of your pet will make you much happier. Take care xoxo"

175965799,"When did she develop this condition? Net talks of children who have it, and adults also. As far as I can determine whatever it is has worsened over the years. I have known her 10 years and it (or whatever it is0 manifested itself not long after we started dating-- however we used to spend hours on many nights discussing things such as her fear, concerns, worries etc, Her often explanation was ""I trust you and know you will listen without judging."" I never tried to ""fix"" just listened and when asked offered observations. She always described herself as a ""runner"" -- my response was I do not quit nor abandon. Her childhood was typical with a mean drunk father and an over controlling, cold mother, that openly carried on an affair with a married dude after her father and mother divorced. The story is long but the short explanation is she has been estranged from her mother for over 5 years and will not speak to her, return a call or even acknowledge when her mother is in the hospital. Her _NAME_ r
esponse is ""I wish she would die"". She has to some degree made amends with her father - but this tenuous at best he is still an alcoholic, but has always been nice to me, at least when I am around. I do not know much of her sister other than what she (my wife) has told me-- since they too are estranged despite the efforts to get her to reconcile -- they have had a long-running sibling love/hate (mostly hate I think) relationship. I do know her sister is an alcoholic, and while degreed cannot keep a job for any length of time nor a boyfriend. From the one side I get, she (the sister) blames the parents for her ""failures."" Hope that answered your question. I am a pretty active reader, and while knowledge can be a dangerous thing, particularly in the hands of the untrained, I am more than confident she has some FORM of BPD it could even be something like Histrionic Personality Disorder.. at this point I am keenly aware she knows something is wrong but is in denial and that stops any hope of ""normalcy""."

My meds have calmed my emotions, so now these points I mentioned feel more like rational assessment than purely depression based gloom. To ease your worries I am in no immediate danger, I have simply lost any hope I had for a better future and with that, my will to fight through adversity. My therapist knows I expect that when my life ends, it will be by my own hand; not today, likely not tomorrow, but someday I will simply bow out of what the world is becoming.

I feel like cleaning all the time and also there's a tune spinning in my head non stop which is very disturbing, even during the night. Today was the first night again on quetiapin. I finally got some sleep which I'm quite happy about. Hopefully it will stay this way. I guess I'm lucky because my husband checks my meds intake every day. This is a habit now.

My mom said that it was too cold and she wanted to sleep in instead of going skiing (We were supposed to leave at 8-8:30am)... My blood pressure must be high from the phenibut.. Idk if it's effects or withdrawal cause that.. Idk.. But ANYWAYS... My cat pissed on the floor so I'm mad at her >:/.. Poor innocent cat.. I went to have a shower, did hygiene things like brushing my teeth, fixed the vacuum and vacuumed my room, made my bed.. So I did all of the things.. --> Have to clean the litter box. My mom made eggs and toast.. I see the doctor tomorrow cuz my psychiatrist said that it's ok to switch to 60mg of Vyvanse.. But Idk.."
175965834,That's awesome!
175965835,Possible trigger: I kind of want to die I think it may be from PMS. I get really severe PMS. Like very very bad mood problems during it.
175965836,Luckily I fell back asleep
175965837,Is it bad that part of me doesn't want to work and wants to just live off of disability the rest of my life?
175965838,Zero sleep. _NAME_ wants to party and sun up. Oh well.
175965839,"Hello, and welcome to Inspire. I am sorry you are feeling anxious because you are alone...even your family has deserted you. That has got to be the worst part of all, when family turns away. Let's look at the bright side of your story....you had cancer 10 years ago, and you survived that.....that is one huge plus mark!! Obviously you are a very strong person, considering what you have been through. As to where you are right now...you are in a period of grief, and a period of anger. Let me suggest that you will figure yourself out quite soon, and you will get rid of the anxiety. There are 2 things you can do to make life better. One is to journal your feelings at the end of every day...make sure you are being truthful with yourself...as you write it. The second thing I will recommend is an excellent book that you can read, and you will find it so helpful. Any good book store will either have it or they can order it for you. It teaches us to find happiness within ourselves. That is not to say that yo
u cannot be happy with a mate also, but the happiness needs to start with self. Here is a picture of the book."
175965840,Are you more paranoid than usual maybe? I know if I’m a bit paranoid a group of people is a hard pass for me.
175965841,So they’re planning on opening up eligibility where I live for the vaccine to anybody ages 12 and up by May 21 so I should be getting my first dose sometime soon. Pretty much all my RL friends are getting their first shot this week because they live in the right neighborhoods and stuff. I just think I’ll feel safer once I’m vaccinated. Still cautious but a little more at ease. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

175965848,"No worries, it was a compliment!"
175965849,I'll be thinking of you today...
175965850,I feel I have to occupy the hours. If I didn’t have to sleep I wouldn’t. I would read or crochet or study or something.
175965851,I have nothing to talk about. I am not snap worthy
175965852,I think it was in general or bipolar but I saw a thread discussing those and apparently it really matters what weight you get because it can be too hot or too heavy depending on weight etc
175965853,Not really. I really should clean my room. Yuck. I probably will lounge around and study the Bible. I think we will BBQ on Saturday. My Dad said he will make hamburgers. We had steak for Father's Day so gotta go cheaper this time. What about you?
175965854,"He phoned. It was an anxious phone call. But I got a refill of vyvanse, atenolol, zopiclone and invega. I feel much better."
175965855,"Desox. Idk if I’m going back to my original brain side or not. Before psychosis I was very right brained. Still am, but now I use my left side so much. It’s weird. I never knew how to do math in school. I was in 8th grade math classes in 12th grade. Now I can do all sorts of math. And math and philosophical theories combined are very intriguing to me. So idk."
175965856,"If I was a sheep dog, I would run around bunting all the people I have (and had) grown accustomed to from this site with my ass. I'd bunt them all into a very loose crowd to keep tabs to make sure they're well - but with still enough space to keep them from hurting each other. ^ Maybe I'd wear armor too. Or a stun-gun. Who knows? The possibilities are endless! Not that I can do anything about it if anyone is not ok, so I guess it doesn't really matter."
175965857,Well my sister officially has cancer......insert swear here......
175965858,"Hey everyone! I’m having so much trouble starting _PERSON_ but I am on the lowest dose, (half of a 5mg) so I feel like I shouldn’t be having these side effects. Did anyone else feel crazy when they first started a medication and what helped ? My anxiety is through the roof I’m getting paranoias and I feel like the room is spinning."
175965859,"It's okay, I get it. It just feels so real to me"
175965860,"Coworker has covid so i have to test tomorrow morning. Awesome. My boss told me to lie to the medical staff so I would get tested. wtf? Anyways, I hope I don't have it. I talk to my psychiatrist and therapist on Tuesday and there is so much to cover. I've been a hot mess lately. I have a rage building up inside of me, but only when i have weak moments."

175965864,They actually gave me a trick question and I partially failed it.
175965865,I'll read it right now. Just I feel weird from sleeping so much. I have no anxiety and I like a little anxiety..

175965867,I'm looking up YouTube channels about neuroscience.. one shows a person recoving from a brain stem stroke.. I feel like one day that my brainstem will disconnect from my brain to the rest of my body. One day.. cuz I tried not to crack it too much for my whole life until I had a dream where I was cracking it intensely and I was doing it in my sleep.. now it cracks different and eventually I cant crack it anymore.. I hope it doesnt become an OCD thing but I'm probably worrying about nothing like how I worry about my completely healthy - nothing wrong with it heart.. Then I think about _NAME_ malformation thingy.. idk..
175965868,"_NAME_, I am sorry you are going thru so much at the sam3 time... and now still COVID... these are trying times for everybody but if you had so many things happening to you, you have multiple trauma and you have to be extra gentle with yourself. I can only encourage you to talk to a counselor.. find someone who u can trust and let it all out. Loneliness alone is a tough one and we all are lonely these days.. w the social distancing. Find a counselor and maybe also an online support group. That way you can communicate w ppl who are in a similar situation and you ll see that you are not alone. I try and reach out to friends, walk with them, connect. Lucky we live in the suburbs and can still walk. Bundle up and take a lunch break. Maybe even in your apartment building you could find someone to communicate with?! Meditating and praying are good. You can journal also. Put it all out on paper. But the human connection is important. So try and get out and walk with a trusted friend. And also, with the ex
perience I have had, e patient with meds and give it a chance to work, important tho work with a psychiatrist, not just a GP.. they are more experienced in this field. And don’t let yourself spiral all the way down and only then get meds. Do it as soon as you can... you have been thru a lot my friend.... meds can help balance you out. Been there, done it... All the best to you, just reach out if you want to share more, important to not keep it all in. And teenagers don’t really care, different time of life. But still. Enjoy them! _NAME_"
175965869,"I'm gonna see if my sister wants to go to mass with me sometime, I haven't been in over a year but it would be nice to go again I think it would be nice to reconnect with my faith. Mass online is one thing, it's great but it's missing something, mass in person is this whole wonderful experience, being in the church, etc. I think I was at my best mentally speaking when I was in RCIA to become Catholic and going to mass every weekend."
175965870,Good except my internet is really slow so I've only been able to download one of my games. Idk if it's possible to get my own personal internet connection set up separately from the building's main wifi (because their wifi sucks) if that was possible I would pay to get that set up but I don't know how or if that works

175965877,"So, yesterday I went over to my friends place who she's living there with her new boyfriend. We caught up with each other. She tells me a secret which has me concern. I try to avoid being totally judgmental. She told me her boyfriend does meth from time to time. Granted, that's his and her business but my friend has a young son and her boyfriend also has a young son too. She tried to reassure me that he's not ""addicted"" to it. Then I was like, ""if he isn't addicted to it than why is he still doing it?"". It's not exactly something you can get off all on your own. She said he does it in the bathroom when the boys aren't there. I told her I wouldn't tell anyone (at least not her family or her ex who is her sons father). I'm worried people will find out about it and her ex will find out and take her son away. I know she'd be heart broken if that happened and also got to worry about his son who's ex will probably try to take custody of his son... who she's neglected him and hasn't seen her since Jan
uary. It would make sense for him to go to a rehab or an addiction counselor to get this sorted out but wont do it in fear their kids would be taken away. It's a very sticky situation... Is there anything I can do? I'd like to suggest something that'll get him the help he needs to get over the meth addiction if he's truly serious about quitting. There's no evidence that the children are being neglected or abused so I don't think it'll be right to call child protective services."

175965883,"I think I asked you this before but how long/how much benzos did you take throughout your life? I think you said you don't know... I don't remember. Xanax and alcohol makes GABA-A receptors slow and agitation free, GHB (Xyrem (Narcolepsy drug to have deep REM sleep) or DateRDrug) and Phenibut makes GABA-B receptors feel good.. Baclofen is chlorinated phenibut. It also works on GABA-B receptors and is really good for alcohol withdrawal DT's. GABA-B receptors feel better than GABA-A ones because they have a high empathy component to them. That's why they call the DateRDrug ""Liquid ecstasy"".. Long term benzo use could maybe contribute to the opposite in withdrawal idk.."

It's my favorite video game franchise, and though some of them aren't that great (the expansion packs, that is), I still buy most of them.

I was able to empathize because my Dad had cancer back in 2010. Luckily he beat it. Then today I Skyped her and she sent me a message maybe 30 minutes later saying that she was sorry but she had a minor medical emergency and would be at work tomorrow. I feel so bad for her. I wish there was something I could do for her ... trigger for Christianity Possible trigger: except pray but since she is in NY and I am in CA it's hard.

In 2005 I lost a bunch of weight and he was very supportive then. I just have to relax and keep going.

B with stand up comedy, _PERSON_ with guitar, and me with philosophy. The younger guy I work with has a good nature, but he hasn't found something that moves him yet. He's frustrated by it.

It’s so worth the money for getting a circle of good supports as your making changes. ( I was broke, living on the edge, and I didn’t let that stop me, I managed to barter with several therapists(baking bread, mending clothes, etc) And this is one nice venue for that....no shame in asking for help.

175965947,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ Actually it went great. I didn’t even need the Pap smear. Even though the Dr office said they would do it next appointment and they keep sending me texts and emails that I’m overdue. I went to the appointment. I had my vitals done. They took me to the room where you do the test and had me change into a gown. Then I sat there for 20 minutes. Then the nurse came in and was like wait...have you been sexually active. I’m like no. She’s all like then you don’t need the test unless you want one. I’m like no thanks. So she tells me to get dressed and go to another room. So then I see the Dr. She asks me again if I have ever been sexually active. I’m like no. She’s like then you don’t need the test. You’re not at risk for cervical cancer and it’s hard to do the test if you’ve never been sexually active. Jeez. So stop texting and emailing me that I’m overdue! So then she goes over my labs which are good and my BP is good. She prescribed me a med for my acne. I e
ven lost a little weight. Then I had the Dr look at my arm for the recent SH. She said it’s a little pink but not infected and just use antibiotic cream. She said to make sure I tell my psych Dr because I may need a med adjustment. Then she gives me a lab form and an appointment for three months. Now they need to stop texting and emailing me that I’m overdue for this test, seriously. I was so stressed out. But it ended good. And my arm is okay from the SH."
175965948,"No, I tend to drink anywhere from 4 to 8 cups a day. I don’t get in a bad mood from it. Usually I feel good. But it’s hit or miss.

I know it affects everyone differently though"
175965949,"LuvMyDAD says a test shows she is at increased risk for colon cancer among other cancers, and notes, ""I’ve been throwing up I can’t sleep and I feel doomed."" I agree with _NAME_ when she says that one of her relatives gets a colonoscopy every year which can reassure you that you don't have it, or catch any problems early so that it will be easier to deal with. To sit outside the hospital and worry doesn't quite get it. _NAME_ said these tests can be done every year. I've never heard of it that often. My doctor used to recommend every 4 or 5 years. My general practitioner was probably the one who recommend it when I reached a certain age, say 50. He or she would have called a colonoscopy doctor to set up an appointment. Can you ask your general practitioner about that? But if you're worried night and day about something you don't even have, I think you're picking up on any possible situation you can find to dwell on the bad side. How about the good side? You don't have it. What happened to tha
t? CBT stresses positive thinking, in that you look at the good (I don't have that disease; I can get a colonoscopy). The good that can come of this is, you can see what you are doing."

Apparently folgers is not what it used to be anymore, like it was a couple of years ago. So I'm throwing out the coffee. I smelled the water and different things like the sink. It seemed ok. And then I smelled the coffee grounds and it smelled like chemicals. I made a decaf cup of coffee from 2 other brands and it was just fine. So I dont think this is a hallucination.

175966000,"I really felt like I was on LSD last night. It was because of the 3 glasses of wine that I had. It was like a calm panic attack that lasted 2-3 hours. I was hearing voices of my moms friend with bipolar cuz she has such a strong personality but it wasn't like ""hearing"" voices.. it was like ""Being"" voices.. Like I WAS her.. And I had a song stuck in my head before it happened.. That's when I knew something was really wrong.. It was like I was becoming everyone that was at the birthday party I went to.. I needed to DREAM it all out. So I took 0.5mg xanax 3 times and finally went to sleep but my stomach was gurgling and heart pumping I thought I had the norovirus cuz someone went home sick with it at the party but it wasn't that. It was a horrible experience. It will probably happen again if I stay up too late. I'm sick of having to sleep 12 hours to avoid this torture. But whatever.. I'm supposed to be tortured. And my cat starts acting like how she does on my bad trip when I dissociate. My siste
rs cat doesn't act like that. It's a horrible WEIRD thing that happens with my cat. I put her with a feeling of ""WTF... WTF IS THIS?"". I think, ""OK go to sleep"" then I think ""What IS sleep?"". ****. When my foot got caught under the covers, I thought that was God. When there was a cat hair stuck to the covers brushing against my face, I thought that was God. When I put a xanax under my tongue and lost it in my mouth, that was God. It happened when the Vyvanse wore off because I'm more likely to dissociate when I can't focus. When it happens, I check my pulse and open my mouth like I’m dead. I had visions of how when I saw a video of a dog getting skinned alive and it just passed out because of pain. I thought I was having an EGO death and I was going to pass out because of the torture that I was experiencing. My eye’s look upwards to the ceiling and I don’t remember where everything is. Objects in my room become something that I can’t comprehend anymore."

As a bipolar, I’m on lithium and mirtazapine anti-depressant, probably for the last 10 years and on other combination of meds before that. Do you think it’s events changing or your meds have stopped working? You cried because you killed a bumblebee. OK. I cried once in front of my psychiatrist and she said, “Aw, you’re just depressed.” And I wasn't on any medicine at the time, because of a foul-up. So, do you think you’re depressed?

The lowest it's ever been while sleeping is 30bpm (But I was exercising a lot every day back then). It goes to ~60bpm when I'm sleeping now and not 40-50bpm when I'm sleeping anymore. I think it's because I'm not exercising as much + I'm on a higher dose of dextroamphetamine. I used to have terrible heart OCD. It was baaaadd... All started after I was on a 4-fluoro-methylphenidate binge and then took lots of 4-AcO-DMT - I was checking my pulse for hours during the trip - Neurogenesis developed and it took a lot of neuroplasticity and training to break the mold of my brain to reform it. The beta blockers helped. I went to my current doctor after the previous doctor in the clinic said my heart was fine and he didn't check my blood pressure. I was given the beta blocker by my current doctor. The first time I noticed my first beta blocker kicking in, I was so relieved
. It was better than a benzo for lowering heart rate. I used to panic if I had to stand up for a long time during work cuz of POTS + I'd lie down on the floor at work as well because that's when it beat at it's lowest bpm. I'm still afraid of intense exercise but I've done it before and nothing was wrong. The more exercise, the better. Antipsychotic - Sleep med - Benzo for panic - Beta blocker - Then stimulant. If it was in any other order, then these meds wouldn't be considered justified."

People on islands that were colonized by westerners have very poor health now that they eat what we eat. We still have the same bodies like in hunter gatherer times. But I can't argue about that here. I just made a small mention yet no one commented on the other things I'm talking about. So I'm sorry if I triggered anyone.

175966040,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed at age 17 with two brain tumors: one near my pituitary and the other in the pineal gland. Since then I have seen many doctors on top of being treated for chronic migraines. I am now 18 years old and since this diagnosis, I haven’t had a day free of pain in over a year. I’ve tried many many different medications, but none have relieved the debilitating pain I experience. I am just reaching out because it can be extremely difficult to cope with depression and all this when others don’t necessarily understand what I’m going through. Also, I feel terrible to have to put loved ones and those I care for through the pain of seeing me in pain. If someone could share how they handle their own mental health and well-being in the midst of pain, I would greatly appreciate it."

175966044,"That's the million-dollar question. And it seems to be vital for ""normal"" social integration in general. I think it is, in a way. Just not an absolute way. Non-rational belief of some kind is inevitable, but it won't be absorbed from the outside in the same way and measure as it is by most people, and it won't serve the same purposes under the same circumstances. Sometimes that will make those personal beliefs more pronounced than normal though, like with more stereotypical schizotypals. I think so too. I like reading/hearing about physics too, but I think it usually puts my head in the clouds instead. I'm trying to think of what it is that keeps my feet on the ground, but I can't name it in a simple way. There's this verse from a song I really like ("" there is harmony in everything ""). It resonates with me. Everything has a positive side. No exceptions. If I don't see it, it's because I haven't looked hard enough yet. Or sometimes because it really is hard to see (and maybe not worth the troub
le), but it's there anyway (and in an extreme-enough circumstance it might actually be worth it). It's obviously not ""true"" (or ""false"" either), but it's an effective guiding principle. The periods of my life when I feel the most troubled are the ones when I find it the hardest to frame reality under that belief, but I still strive to do it, and that's how I recover."

I take it at dinner because you are supposed to take it with food, and I keep it on the table. But since my sister has a three year old, my Mom didn't want the medicine out. So it got put on the counter by the salt and pepper which I don't use. I've been back on the Latuda for a couple of days and I don't think I am having symptoms. So I will wait and see if anymore pop up or if it was just a blip from not taking the medication. See T--Dr K on the 11th. I still haven't done my homework. Bleh."

175966052,"In my personal experience, existential problems only occurred when shifting from ""childhood"" into adulthood. Therefore, I'm finding this existential depression concept hard to grasp. My issues are personal. My concerns are personal. My goals are personal. Thoughts about a ""bigger"" picture are beyond me. I'm not much into religion or society...therefore I can't see this existential issue as relevant, personally."
175966053,"Oh no, I’m sorry to hear that! :( please don’t feel bad about it though ok? I had kind of a similar experience last year, except it happened while I was at work and then continued on all day... I was feeling that same pain in my chest almost like someone was stabbing me, it scared me. It then went to turning into really really bad side pain too that felt so painful it was hard to sit, but also feeling hard to breathe, finally my mom just ended up having me do a telehealth thing over the phone with a doctor. They said they thought I was having a heart complication or heart attack or something and to go to the ER right away, so we did. At that point it’s 3AM and I couldn’t calm down, the pain seemed to only get worse and worse and I thought that I was either going to die or that something was terribly wrong with my health at this point. They did all sorts of tests on me I didn’t know what they were going to tell me, and an hour later they told me it’s what they called “Costcocondritis
 which just basically meant really bad chest wall pain. They said, “you’re just fine, and super healthy, but have you ever thought you had anxiety?” I didn’t even realize until that point that it was anxiety, or that I had anxiety and felt that same embarrassment. But looking back at it now, I guess I’m glad I went because it was reassuring that I was ok. I still do get that pain every once and a while mostly when I’m feeling really anxious or stressed out over something, and I’m still kind of trying to figure out what seems to help, but a big thing that sometimes really helps me when I feel that way is ginger, it usually seems to help at least a little bit. :) I hope you’re feeling better, and that this helps a bit at least! :)"

174356241,"First of all, I don't have schizophrenia. But the way my mind works is rather unsettling and I'm not sure how to describe it. I'm not sure whether it can be called hallucinations, but it might be that. Anyway, I'm not sure this is the right forum to post this in, so please move it if it's not - I couldn't find anything more appropriate. Anyway. I'm on Fluoxetine, or Prozac, and I feel like these meds are messing with my mind. Without them, my anxiety becomes unbearable, but I feel these meds mess with my memories and perception in a way it's beyond unsettling. I remember something from five seconds ago vividly and precisely - only to discover those memories are entirely wrong. I try to think about it again, and suddenly the clear memories are fuzzy. I no longer remember it clearly. Which makes sense, given the thing I just thought to remember was false, but how was I so sure? How did it feel so real? Today a car passed me, driving up to an intersection where my house is located. The parking spot to 
our house is also located there. The car brakes, and - at that moment - I saw the car park in our spot, only noticing there it was my dad that passed me. Though he did not get out of the car. As I approached it, he suddenly came out of the house. No driver in the car. He said he'd been home for the past 30 minutes. I vividly remembered just seeing the car park there, but that couldn't be. I felt like I had just encountered a glitch in the matrix - or rather, I felt nothing really. I feel like I should've panicked, but I didn't. Maybe because these clear memories I thought I had were no longer there. It felt like it was the strangest thing I ever encountered, yet just minutes later it already began feeling more normal since I no longer had these clear memories. Long story short, I feel like sometimes my brain just stops paying attention to the real world and fabricates its own reality for a few seconds, but begins throwing out that false memory as soon as you try to think back on it. I'm not sure how to feel a
bout this. I feel like this can be classified as hallucinations and it's incredibly unnerving and unsettling. I don't remember having had these encounters when I didn't take the medicine yet. Some other info that might be worth mentioning that might relate to this: - Sometimes I hear very subtle sounds, of which I'm not sure whether they are really there or not. - I had exploding head syndrome for a few months in the past, though it has stopped. I took the most medicine during that period. - I have already witnessed bright flashes at night that weren't there, though this was rather rare. - Often I find it very hard to focus. I don't give any deeper meaning to these occurrences myself, though it feels like my mind thinks reality is being warped itself (this might be related to my OCD). I don't feel like I'm going crazy, but I find this so unnerving and I'm not sure what to do."
175966074,"I read something cool in a book. It's about making questolutions instead of resolutions (of course I'm not saying resolutions are bad). But a questolution is something you propose to yourself in the form of a question. For example, one of mine is: How might I get myself to run every day? I just thought it was kind of a cool idea because it gets your mind thinking about how to make that come true without putting extra pressure on yourself or criticizing yourself."
175966075,Idk first it just felt like such work and I couldn’t be bothered and it just feels like it’s almost a waste of time I have better things to do. I could be sleeping or studying or reading instead. It feels like a chore. I don’t really understand it.
174356237,"Hello, _PERSON_, I agree with a lot of what _PERSON_ said. Maybe because I also have a brother who had a suicide attempt and was diagnosed schizophrenic around age 20. I had already been in therapy for several years, and I believed he should be reported for his suicide attempt. I made the report, he was hospitalized against his will. He blamed me, of course, and wouldn't see me while in the hospital. The worst time in my family's lifetime, and we had already had bad times. So yes, there is the brutal pain of the others to consider. But also as in my brother's case, and I do feel much pain for _PERSON_, he is still with us at age right around 50. He struggles everyday with implications of his mental illness, but he is compliant with his meds, and he works a full-time job. My parents passed away in recent years and we found him an apartment not far from me. He's been there about 1.5 years. It has been a long road, with a few more hospitalizations in the meanwhile. He learned to know enough to sign hi
mself in when the doctors said he should. Last time coming up on 10 years ago. So, _PERSON_, sometimes it does work out in the longer run. And even making it for 30 years for _PERSON_ brother was an accomplishment for him and the family. We don't want to think about a tragic, painful ending. But we press on, like we family members do with our own lives, despite difficulties. I hope you find the treatment you need. If you tell us more about you personally, instead of the intellectual debate, maybe we can help."

175966079,"Hello _NAME_.I think my Doc wants me to try Seroquel (again ).I tried it a few years ago when I was taking Anti D s ( misdiagnosed for Depression instead of Bipolar ).The side effect was that I dreamed a lot ,woke up tired and was in a daze until about noon even, if I cut the smallest dose in half. I have been told that taking it with a mood stabilizer (Lamictal ) may not give me the same side effects as taking with an Anti D.I am considering trying it again and if it does not work Risperdone would be my next choice but it has so many bad side effects ( so they say). I am even considering cannabis (pot) even though i have never taken drugs or even smoked.It has helped many people who are bipolor relax and sleep well.The lamictal is working well but it speeds me up and I can t sleep more than 3-4 hours per night.

174356289,"I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and ADHD. A learning disability. I didn’t finish due to my learning disability. Before the pandemic I enrolled in GED classes. I attend school at midnight from 5-8. I’m unable to learn math. it’s difficult. I attempted to work with a few tutors but they gave up on me because I didn’t understand there way of teaching. Then I was matched with another tutor and the way she explained to me was easy to understand. But now that everything is online due to COVID-19 it’s been difficult. She moved to another state. Trying to learn on a computer is hard. I’m feeling worthless. I want to be apart of the world and graduate school and get a good job but I don’t see that happening. My main priority is getting my GED. my learning disability is holding me back from achieving my goals. 95 percent of my depression comes from the fact that I didn’t finish school. I feel like a nobody. I don’t know what’s the point of living if I’m not happy. I feel i
solated from the world. The loneliness is feeling is making things worse. I get waves of sadness and despair. I wake up every morning with anxiety/panic attacks. I can’t sleep. I only get like 3 hours of sleep. The medication my doctor is giving me I don’t feel like it’s working. I feel alone with no where to turn to. I’ve been admitted in the hospital before but that didn’t help me. They kept me locked in a room. Isolated and no one to talk to. When I was locked up for a month, I expected to speak to a therapist or someone but no one ever spoke to me. I expected the doctors to find out the route to my problems and trying to figure out a solution but I was isolated in a room by myself and I felt even more lonely in there then when I was out. Every morning a staff who worked at the front desk would come into my room and ask me if I was suicidal. That’s the only human contact I had with someone. At one point I figured I wasn’t getting help so I had to pretend like I was happy and tell them what th
ey wanted to hear so they could let me leave. Going to a mental hospital didn’t help me. I feel like no one can. I feel like no one understands my pain."

However, learning that you can retrain your brain so that thinking in a more posive way, has been a game changer! Our brains will respond to whatever thoughts they are exposed to...so catching the negative thoughts and redirecting them into good ones will become a habit over time. It takes some practice, but it will work with continued effort...and even start to change the brain's chemistry! Using 'Therapy Worksheets' to restructure negative thoughts...as well as practicing 'Positive Mantras' are two tools to start with. You can find directions for both in our Resources.

175966126,"I understand your rage. I want to be happy and healthy so much and sometimes what I need the most is someone who understands or just supports me and makes me know I’m not alone. Doctors are famously sharp and emotionally distant so they can “perform better their job”. But at some point they really don’t know what they are doing. Or at least it feels this way. And I think they do have a bias when it comes to women. They think we are overly dramatic and hysterical and we can’t handle life. I beg to differ. We deal with so much and we survive so much, it is just absolutely appalling the way doctors treat us sometimes. So while doctors and hotline and grief workers might dismiss us, I think we the sufferers, the people who actually hurt and are sick, we understand each other much better and we provide each other with relief and support. So if you can find a group of people who gather somewhere close to where you live I think it would be good for you. Sending hope and best wishes to you!"

But staying positive and praying it continues to work great for me. Today will be day 6, so far the only side effects I still notice are dry mouth, brain fog and very minimal anxiety in the mornings but subsides very quickly. I have energy some days and other days i just want to be lazy. I am finally getting my appetite back as well.

I dont quite understand why calling so much warrants blocking a phone number, and all social media stuff. It was at the time when I didnt have a job etc everything going on now. It makes me upset, cuz they called me their best friend, and I did so much for them. Like answering phone calls when they were in trouble in a abusive relationship, at like 2 and 3 in the morning.

You definitely don’t need a God per se, it’s the guiding aspect I was thinking of..Buddhism is perfect for that. The problem with believing in all of them isn’t so much a problem with the theism so much as knowing which to turn to in your time of need.

Lol, socio/psychopaths are always fighting ... the phrase ""rebel without a cause"" uniquely applies to the antisocials of the world. Your thread in the ASPD forum made me laugh because yep they all had to fight and I was like, ""popcorn time"" ... lol. My dad has diagnosed ASPD and NPD, but he is not ""evil"". Insufferably egotistical and over the top arrogant, definitely ... and completely lacking in empathy and not much of a conscience (he has zero tolerance for pedophiles and stuff like that, though) but nope, not evil. Mostly oblivious to how his actions impact other people more than anything, he has never been at all sadistic or whatever. But good lord he and I got into it when I was younger, I do not even remember all of why we fought but it was every day for awhile. I am no sociopath but I am also very willful, and stubborn to

She needs to try to help herself. Otherwise it means nothing. Maybe I didn't explain this in enough detail. She didn't want to get involved with me. She warned me repeatedly : - ""You don't want to have anything to do with me."" - ""I have the world's worst temper."" - ""Three husbands have left me because of my ungovernable temper."" - ""I nearly killed my last husband during one of my uncontrollable rages."" - ""I will bring you nothing but sadness and misery."" - ""You have yet to see my full temper. You have only seen the tip of the iceberg. My temper is worse than you can ever imagine."" ... She didn't say these things to me just once. She said them to me over and over and over again. And I kept telling her over and over again that I would be different. That I would make soothing her nerves and pacifying her temper my number one prior

175966157,"Although I did say it later in the post from which the above quote was culled, I should point out that when given ample space, I am also more likely to seek out social interaction, or at least think about it without dismissing the idea so quickly. As far as people accepting you as you are, yes, there has to be some compromise. On both sides. But this compromise can be adjusted to fit the situation at hand. For example; it's perfectly reasonable for your wife to expect you to interact with her family, but she should also understand that when you pass the point of being able to tolerate it comfortably, she should offer you some kind of exit. That's all. I can't really give you any tips regarding the topic here, because I am not married. If anything, I enjoy too much isolation. Sometimes just going out onto the street after a few days inside can be surreal, even jarring. I'm tempted to say that's probably not healthy, but neither is the alternative. I can answer the following questions, though: What c
ounts as being alone? Mainly, knowing nobody has any expectations of me. No calls to return, no emails to respond to, no pending business that might cause somebody to call, or worse (unspeakably so) to knock on my door. I want one of these: Is it possible to increase feeling alone even when other people are nearby? When I lived in a house with five other people, simply being alone in my room was usually the best I could do. I suppose it's a matter of degree. If I found myself in a similar situation these days, it would take me a long time to adjust to accepting that my solitude would have to be compromised. In fact, being that I've lived alone for the past 25 years, I wonder if I could ever adjust. It's a scary thought, but that fear is tempered only by the fact that I am currently in quite a bit of financial distress, and taking on a roommate would be an ideal solution as far as finances go. But I've lived here for 12 years, alone except for the first, and having anyone move in would feel like a violation I 
could never come to terms with. If I were ever to share a living space with someone, it would have to be in a new place. The apartment where I live now is too much ""mine"". To see anyone else lounging on the couch at 10 PM would never stop feeling like an invasion. I've rubbed my scent everywhere. Are there good strategies for negotiating more time alone - particularly from family? Actually I can answer this. What I used to do is be aware of everybody else's schedule so I could make sure that if there was ever a window of time when nobody else would be home, I would make sure to take advantage of it. I can even remember calling out of work once or twice to take advantage of an empty house."
175966158,I’ve always wanted to say this But y’all ever notice that when u can’t breathe from anxiety and it feels like your dying and then you take an anti anxiety and it’s like you can breathe again? It’s like the AntiAnxiety pill is an inhaler for anxiety. I always think that when I take it.
175966159,"Hi whoever is reading this. I don't exactly know what to expect from this but I def need support and a private place to vent. I have been diagnosed as bipolar, depression,social anxiety disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain disoreder.I know it makes me sound pretty jacked up. A back story I was in the army for 12 years. During that time I had mental issues that I was able to powered through ,despite deployments ,until they caught up to me. At the end I started having bipolar episodes and anxiety attacks just the feeling of great fear anytime I had to be around people. This led me to lie to get out of having to be around others. I was a pretty good solider and ranked up quickly until about 6 months prior to being medically retired I completely fell apart. That was almost three years ago now, I can't feel anything but shame for my service.Since that time I have been deemed disabled. Now to my issues that constantly bother me, I feel so horrible for lying, and how my last 6 months went that I constantly 
think about it and feel so ashamed. I know I was told by both military and civilian docs that it was bound to happen but that dosen't make me feel any better as I feel like it's just an excuse. On top of that I feel useless to society as a whole for not working. I get such anxiety and fear that I can't bring myself to actuality show up then I feel ashamed, then remorse just a constant cycle. Then once on disability I can't stop thinking what a failure I am for that because I am only 33. I guess I don't know how to forgive myself and move on. On top of everything my father passed away (my last living parent as I lost my mom and step father a few years back) a couple weeks ago. A friend from the military committed suicide this week (that makes the 8th vet I have known that committed suicide). I can't stop thinking about death and how nothing in this life really matters in the end. It must be a sweet relief to finally feel shame and stress release from your body. I am really tired of living through death. The on
ly thing that keeps me going is my wife and son both of 14 years. I feel like I have let them down as well. It's funny how I always dreamed of leaving poverty, now I am doing ok financially but absolutely miserable. I legit hate myself and I don't know how to help that. I am tired of trying new meds, going through side effects. I really feel close to defeat. If anyone actually reads this whole thing I sincerely thank you."

175966168,"I have tapered my Sertraline 3 times. Also naturally, started 3 times. Starting gives me more side effects than tapering, it also depends on the dosage you are using. As others mentioned go slow, and discuss with your dr. Give yourself time. I say if you have been feeling stabilized for quite a while then yes, increased anxiety would be some amount of withdrawal. But it shouldn't be more than a week, just like starting sertraline first time. It's annoying but you can test it out if you still feel good after withdrawal. Unfortunately not much to do other than waiting and seeing the results. I had the same questions when I stopped meds the first time and I didn't even have withdrawal symptoms. That's a possibility"

It’s been 3 years now but most recently happening more now not sure if it’s stress or anxiety but it’s possible. What happens to me is I start hearing my heart beating loud on the right side of my ear and I hear it clearly. My ears start to close up as if they are full of pressure and my head. I start to feel disorientated like I cannot not function i feel off balance cannot sit or lay down cause of pressure in head. I feel really weird. I have had an MRI year years ago with contrast on my head. And it came out normal. I have had my blood pressure and all test normal with heart. I notice if I take half a clonasapam in about 10 mins I feel back to normal. But it’s a _NAME_ ow feeing that I have no control over it takes over me quickly. Has this happened to anyone?? Maybe I’m losing my hearing ? Or I have fluid from 
allergies? No clue I tried look online to see if this is an anxiety symptom and cannot locate anywhere so my thoughts are going toward I’m seriously ill. Please help

Which they probably NEED to be adjusted but I didn't WANT them adjusted because I already feel like a zombie and didn't want to add something else in the puzzle that would make it worse. T was okay. I told her about some trauma stuff but she didn't respond. Literally said nothing. Later she said I had been through a lot and that a lot of people had hurt me (I don't think it's a lot, I think it's that the hurt is a lot) and that I'm strong even if I don't feel like it.

I wish I didn't have to take this exam and I could just start my math courses already. I'm excited about some of my elective choices. Number Theory, and Intro to Game Design, Web Server Management, and stuff like that. Anyway, I went and got a blood test after work. Then I went to the pharmacy and I'm getting so tired of pharmacies in general. They didn't have my lithium refill ready because 'it's too early'. I had to explain to them I had a dosage change - from twice a day to three times a day. So I have like a week left and I don't want to run out. Then they told me they wo

I put them in a display book once I’m done. But display book isn’t pretty. I want to combine them in a book with pretty covers. I can just bind them myself but me lazy ?

175966212,Having an anxiety ridden day. Doing the whole sitting at the desk too anxious to log in thing. I hate hate hate anxiety. It freaking takes over my life when it acts up. I took Ativan for the first time in months with no response I think I’m getting overly emotionally involved in all this drama with _PERSON_ and my **** *** family members. It’s keeping me up at night...it’s why I had so much to drink yesterday. I can’t let this turn into something like my niece/sister fiasco. I don’t think I can survive another bout of that kind of emotionally draining toxic family destruction.

175966230,So talked to my grandma today. She sold her house and is moving into an old folks assisted living places (the ones where they get apartments and then have gathering places and meals). She’s 94 so I’m not surprised. She also said with the money she gets from selling her house she’s going to give a bunch to all her grandkids and it’s like I never expect anything but love from my grandma but I gotta admit part of me… I’m kind of excited because any money would help get me out of debt quicker and part of me hopes it’s enough to clear off my debt. Whatever it is it’s very generous of my grandma and she really didn’t have to. Is it wrong to be a little excited?? Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175966231,"Dear _PERSON_, I totally understand how you are thinking. I've been there and my slightly out of range test result was something liver/pancreas related... imagine how anxious I became over that. xD Meanwhile the Dr was looking at my face and smiling. Then she said ""slightly out of range doesn't mean anything. Your other liver results are perfect. Don't worry"" After that of course I kept thinking about that for a month or so, then I replaced it with a new worry (it's typical for worriers) and when I realized the pattern of my thoughts, I calmed. It's been 4 years. I don't have a liver problem as far as I am concerned. And I don't want to check to be honest. So to sum it up, you will be fine if your Dr is not worried. Listen to them If you can't overcome the worry, ask for a second opinion. But it may cause more anxiety imo, so stick to your CBT skills as much as you can. All will be fine <3"

175966249,"Hello everyone! I am new here (first post). I am looking for support as I was just diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. It all started a little over a month ago, I started having severe panic attacks daily. It then turned to multiple times a day. EVERYTHING and ANYTHING was causing them. It go so bad I had to be hospitalized for 3 days in psychiatric facilty because I became suicidal. After I was released I then reacted badly to my anti depressant I was on (second time this has happened). I finally got to see a psychiatrist and after going over symtoms and my entire life basically he came to his diagnosis. I'm still in shock. Its still hard to believe I honestly question if he is right. IDK. I felt like all of this revolved around my panic attacks. I thought my panic attacks caused my deep depressive states. I would really love to hear everyones opions and similar stories if you have any. Also I am 27 years old."

I found it really hard to wake up after taking seroquel and olanzepine but the caffeine and vyvanse woke me up.. very grateful for these stimulants.. and they dont give me psychosis like 99.999% of people with schizophrenia.

There is a fairly good chance that it could perform well for you again, so it is a good place to start. However, knowing going in that sometimes going back on the same Rx isn't successful, will help you in being flexible with a plan B. In other words, be hopeful, but open to whatever option(s) you need to explore. I hope that you get the right regimen going again soon, so you can start to feel better. We are cheering you on.

The only thing I think we can do is just take it one day, or even one minute, at a time. Having to stay at home all the time can cause people to fight with each other and get annoyed easily. If you can, try to give each other some space. That's what I'm doing with my partner, and it's been working pretty well. It's hard to be locked in the house all day without any time to yourself, right? That's what I've found. I hope things get better for you! Just take deep breaths and try to focus on what is happening now, all the beautiful things around you, leaning into the present and trying not to think so much about the future."
175966271,"I'm new here. I am just happy that I found a forum that is current and not from years back. I suffer from Bipolar , depression and anxiety disorder. I decided to pick this forum for today. I am not doing so great. My bipolar is rearing it's ugly head and the last couple of weeks have been an absolute disaster . I can't work because my anxiety is so bad it literally makes me feel paralyzed. I have a teaching degree and I've been subbing for 3 1/2 years. I hate it! I literally was waking up every morning in a cold sweat and barely getting in 3 days a week. I finally got offered a job this year and my anxiety is so overwhelming I turned it down. I am not unhappy with my decision. I know I couldn't do it, and I did not want the students to suffer or have a mental break at work. But now everyone is mad at me , including my husband. I have student loans to pay back and have no idea what to do at this point b/c I literally can't get of the sofa. I am literally paralyzed with fear, worry and panic. I am al
so depressed and can not concentrate. I am arguing with my family and have terrible mood swings. I think the pressure of teaching and having to go to work everyday to a job that I HATE just set me over the edge and I""m having a hard time getting myself back. Through out my life any time I have have extreme pressure, stress my bipolar gets so bad I can not function. I have been to several different doctors, psychologists, csw and have had dr.'s prescribe many many medications. I DON'T do well on bipolar medications , side effects are awful. I'm currently taking Cymbalta 60mg. 1x a day, and I have Xanax but don't take it b/c it makes me feel worse the next day. My anxiety makes me fear taking a new medication so I have not tried any new ones in years. I am tired all the time b/c I am having a hard time sleeping . I feel like I'm in a dark hole and I am trying to get out but keep slipping down the wall."

175966273,"Hello! I’m 12 and I’ve been noticing something similar to what you guys see. I see this transparentish or translucent white trail following things that are specifically white or remotely bright in environments with even remotely dim lighting. I also see it if I were to move something, like my hand across a background that is black or dark, that is, only if there is little to no light shining on the background. It’s been bothering me a lot lately and has been giving me a lot of anxiety. So I too have anxiety. I also see something similar to what I see in the dim lighting situation when I move my Ipad in a dark room. It’s not exactly the same though. The one I see in dim lighting has a more prominent or defined edge, like the edge is darker or more noticeable, while the one I see when moving my IPad in a dark room does not have a defined edge. I asked my brother if he saw the trail when he moved his phone in a dark room and he said he saw it too. So I am not really concerned about the one I s
ee with my Ipad as much I am with the one I see in dim rooms. I at first noticed this when I walked into my bedroom with a dim light on and approached my bed that has white bed sheets. I think the dim light was shining on the white bed sheets, making it brighter, but was not powerful enough to illuminate the rest of the room, making a dim environment and a slightly brighter bed. I approached it and saw the trail, but at the time I thought it was a spider web of some sort because of the defined edge. I waved it off as probably nothing and only saw it a few more times occasionally. However, recently maybe because of my anxiety, I have been seeing it more and in more places. Maybe you guys are still active here. It’s better to find out I’m not the only one with something like this. Is what you guys see similar to mine? Is your trail a transparentish white or is it the color of the object? Has yours gotten any worse over the months? A Person Post Edited (A_Person245) : 10/30/2019 3:04:55 PM (GMT-6) 1 2 3 4"

The reason was because I didn't think I could continue going on with my life without psychiatric medication. And looking back, I was right. Although I've found talk therapy to be helpful, I can't survive without being on psychiatric medication. Yes, all psychiatric medications have potential side effects.

I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist and tell her exactly this and see if there's anything that she can prescribe that is like phenibut and doesn't cause tolerance. If not, then I see psychedelics as the only option."

Not like... psychotic. But kind of disordered. I keep skipping breakfast. I feel guilty eating sometimes. Trying to eat smaller portions because I need to lose weight but my mind keeps going to extremes. IDK just my brain is working too much.

I suffer with anxiety (health anxiety). I have been tested for my heart , stress test, echo, ecg, wore hear monitor. All came back normal. My history I don’t have high blood pressure it’s always low or heart diseases just cholesterol has been borderline since I was a teen but not high enough to be on meds. My mom just recently been put on BP meds she is 60. As her Pressure was abit high. I have been having chest pain for a couple of weeks now on and off. Yes I went to dr. But she said it’s from my anxiety tensing up my chest walls and stress can cause it too. So my question is for those who have had a heart attack. How can I tel the difference between heart attack or just stress pain ???? This worries me soooo much by our help is appreciated. The pain is constant all day all night only time I don’t feel it is if I’m sleeping"

I feel very calm right now because of the Vyvanse and atenolol. When the Vyvanse wears off, it will be almost time to sleep so I'll just prepare myself for bed and hopefully not panic my brains out and eyes rolling to the back of my head and I die.. I'm gonna focus on technology right now like the new phones and tablets.. I want to get a good tablet like the new iPad Pro."

You ask how to cut him out of your life.........my dear I believe you already know that, but perhaps you are dragging your feet on this issue because in your secret thoughts, you think that MAYBE the day will come when he will treat you better.

Consequently, when on autopilot, I still do this to myself. Today, even after having had a great time with other people outside the house in real life, I'll come home and mentally turn the event into a massive social faux pas on my part, resent those with whom I'd had a good time, start avoiding them, and then eventually alienate them. It's my habit and totally messed up. Very, very, very hard to remain consistently aware of all the stuff I have to work on.

He said I’m on WAY TOO MUCH and acted like I was taking it wrong. He said “NOOOOO THATS A TOXIC AMOUNT!!!” Hello!!!!! “You’re the one who prescribed it that way! FOR YEARS!!!! YOU’RE the one refilling my meds!!!” I’m just worried with all these changes! He said I should call him IF I’m having any issues. Ummm like, yeah!!!!

175966354,"getting by said... I feel like your wife's temper should be her problem and not yours. I agree but when she starts raging out of control and violently taking her anger out on me, then it becomes my problem by default. getting by said... Does she do anything to try to change these actions? Does she take her medications? She takes her medication except for her last ""emergency"" tranquilizer -- as she calls it. She is suppose to take it when she feels her control slipping away. The problem is that her control slips away so quickly that there isn't time for her to take it. And that is the entire point of this thread. getting by said... As earlier I posted she needs to be on something to take daily, maybe an antidepressant. I don't know too much about what she takes but she does take some sort of sedative to make her less irritable and another mood stabilizer which is also suppose to help and they do. Again, the problem is the third medication. It is something called Xanax and it is suppose to have an 
almost immediate calming effect and she's only suppose to take it when she feels her control slipping away. That's the one that she doesn't have time to take because she blows up before she has a chance to take it. getting by said... I feel her temper tantrums are totally selfish and someday something real bad could happen with all that rage inside. If you've been following this topic along, you've seen that she has a history of violence. Which is why I've learned the warning signs -- her hands begin to tremble, her pupils dilate to the point where they are almost black and then her entire body starts shaking, the veins in her neck and forehead begin to bulge, her eyes also start bulging like they are about to pop out -- and when I see these warning signs, I try to get as far away from her as possible. getting by said... Does she go to therapy? What about anger management? She goes to a court appointed treatment. He gives her pills and that's pretty much it. He gets paid by the court / insurance and that's al
l he seems to be interested in and she is doing it because if she doesn't, she'll be put in jail -- her option was to get treatment for her anger or go to prison for her attack on her third husband. She's going through the motions of getting treatment. getting by said... It is your choice whether or not to continue to endure this behavior. I want to make it better but I don't know what to do. I've discovered that being loving and attentive isn't going to fix things because she blows up so quickly and a lot of times it is over things that are not even my fault but I am on the receiving end. getting by said... Maybe you should move out for awhile. Feel what it is like to live without the chaos and drama for a bit. I think her behavior is going to make you depressed if it hasn't already.. Maybe some tough love would persuade her to get some help. I'm afraid to even consider that. Most of her outbursts are over trivial things and the explosions are pretty bad. I hate to even imagine how great her fury would be if 
she lost her temper over something more serious. getting by said... I wish you the best. Hugs, _NAME_... Thank you. I appreciate that. I really do."

175966362,"I'm tolerant to 0.5mg of xanax a day.. Just the half life. I didn't take it yesterday evening and then started feeling heat in my chest and derealization like I was going to panic. My pocket med box was in my bag in the car which was locked. My sister took the keys with her to another place so I told my mom to phone my sister so I can take my meds and to ""hurry up"". My mom started talking to me like she normally does and I couldn't care about what everyone was saying so I said ""I'm anxious"" - My mom said ""Do you want an ativan?"" and I said ""Yes"".. My sisters friend laughed (Because she always thinks I'm funny but this time it wasn't funny) so I put an ativan under my tongue. So that's the last time I'm not keeping my pocket med box in my pocket outside of my room. I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor to put me on 10mg of valium and decrease by 2mg (1/5th of a xanax - one benzo) every 2 weeks slowly and then stop and never think or talk about it again. I wasn't using any of these 
benzos to get high - I really need them occasionally for derealization/depersonalization (Dissociation) from hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (psychedelic flashbacks) that cause really really horrific panic attacks. But so far I haven't had derealization in 2 months. I think it's gone now."

I am starting to isolate myself, it's difficult to remain present and not many understand when I try to tell them whats happening. It can feel extremely lonely and I'm here with you. Different things work for others of course, but one thing i did when I was having extreme fear, axiety, and paranoiamy trip for a momentary relieve was smelling lemongrass oil. I'd carry it everywhere. I prefer methods that are not internal processes. Listening to music may help, but it can also effect your mood while you are vulnerable, or something of that sort. I have done a lot of meditating as well and have learned to only do it guided with my therapist, as I'm being taught that opening your mind up more while it is already batteling itself can actually exasperate whats going on in there. This is why i like to use things like aromatherapy. 
Massaging yourself may be beneficial as you are nurturing your body. If you are able to make an effort to get some exercise it could help perhaps even if its just climbing stairs a few times. I understand how difficult and frightening, its very complex, my suggestion would be to take baby steps. If you can relieve your heart and mind for even 30 seconds during those crisis moments you could find some form of relief. I hope this helps you somewhat , I'm here."

175966409,"Psychological torture is being exploited by states to circumvent the more widely understood ban on physically inflicting pain and may open the way to a future of “cyberculture”, the UN torture rapporteur has said. _PERSON_, professor of international law at the University of Glasgow and the UN’s special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, is cautioning that the internet could be used systematically to target individuals remotely – through “intimidation, harassment, surveillance, public shaming, and defamation”. A trenchant critic of the UK government’s failure to hold an inquiry into the rendition of jihadi suspects post-9/11, _PERSON_ has also voiced concerns over Britain’s treatment of the WikiLeaks founder _NAME_ in Belmarsh prison. Later this month the professor, who is Swiss, will present a report to the UN human rights council in _NAME_ highlighting his concern over “continuing development of psychological tortures and legal 
misconceptions about what conduct is prohibited by an international treaty”. His comments coincide with the UK release of a documentary, Eminent Monsters: A Manual for Modern Torture, which investigates covert CIA funding in the 1950s of techniques developed by the Scottish-born psychiatrist Dr. _NAME_. The documentary, directed by the Bafta-winning film-maker _NAME_, shows how patients were subjected to sensory deprivation, forced comas, LSD injections, and extreme physical and mental torture at a Canadian research establishment run by _NAME_. Those techniques, the documentary claims, were forerunners of methods used on the so-called “hooded men” who were subjected to white noise, put in stress positions, threatened and deprived of sleep, food, and water, and beaten after being arrested during internment in Northern Ireland in 1971. Similar techniques were later inflicted by US forces on jihadi suspects detained in Guantánamo Bay. In a 2018 judgment after the hooded men case was reopened, the European 
court of human rights reaffirmed that abuse of the 14 men almost 50 years before amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment, but did not constitute torture. That distinction, _PERSON_ argues, is wrong. “Judges think that physical torture is more serious than cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment,” he told the Guardian. “Torture is simply the deliberate instrumentalization of pain and suffering.” Consequently, psychological torture methods are often used “to circumvent the ban on torture because they don’t leave any visible marks”. In his UN report, _PERSON_ points out that many countries “deny, neglect, misinterpret or trivialize psychological torture as what could be euphemistically described as ‘torture light’, whereas ‘real torture’ is still predominantly understood to require the infliction of physical pain or suffering. “Some states have even adopted national definitions of torture excluding mental pain or suffering, or interpretations requiring that in order to constitute t
orture, mental pain or suffering must be caused by the threat or infliction of physical pain or suffering, threats of imminent death, or profound mental disruption.” Many countries have invested “significant resources towards developing methods of torture which can achieve purposes of coercion, intimidation, punishment, humiliation or discrimination without causing readily identifiable physical harm or traces”, _PERSON_ states. “Some of these approaches have resurfaced most prominently in connection with interrogational torture in the context of counter-terrorism, ‘deterrence’-based detention of irregular migrants, alleged mass-internment for purposes of political ‘re-education’, and the abuse of individual prisoners of conscience.” An alarming development that Melzer contemplates is “cyberculture”. States, corporate actors, and organized criminals, he says, “not only have the capacity to conduct cyber-operations inflicting severe suffering on countless individuals but may well decide 
to do so for any of the purposes of torture. “Cybertechnology can also be used to inflict, or contribute to, severe mental suffering while avoiding the conduit of the physical body, most notably through intimidation, harassment, surveillance, public shaming and defamation, as well as appropriation, deletion or manipulation of information. “Already harassment in comparatively limited environments can expose targeted individuals to extremely elevated and prolonged levels of anxiety, stress, social isolation, and depression, and significantly increases the risk of suicide. “Arguably, therefore, much more systematic, government-sponsored threats and harassment delivered through cyber technologies not only entail a situation of effective powerlessness but may well inflict levels of anxiety, stress, shame, and guilt amounting to ‘severe mental suffering’ as required for a finding of torture.” In his UN report, _PERSON_ pays tribute to Eminent Monsters for showing “the origins and devastating effects o
f contemporary psychological torture”. Such experiments, he added, should be prevented in the future. Of the UK government’s decision last year not to hold a judicial inquiry into post-9/11 rendition, _PERSON_ told the Guardian: “I’m very worried. The convention against torture requires it. That refusal sets an example that we don’t really have to investigate and prosecute.”"

Just another hour then I can go home. Then it is the weekend. Had some hallucinations this week. Auditory. _NAME_ is back on antibiotics because she has another infection. I'm just going to keep her on the antibiotics until she runs out of them this time. Hopefully it will kill off any more infection.

175966442,You seem to have good guesses on it. It is possible to have schizophrenia and dissociation. I used to hear voices in psychosis (Auditory) but they are different from dissociative voices (More mental). My dissociation was caused by use of psychedelics and is treated with olanzepine. I don't think most psychiatrists/psychologists are trained much about dissociation. I think the important thing is to make sure that your son is able to distinguish dissociative symptoms from those of schizophrenia (Because they can overlap) - So he doesn't get hospitalized for dissociative symptoms that can be treated with therapy rather than being hospitalized.
175966443,I was working on a king sized crochet blanket but I ran out of yarn and I need to get more of a different colour because they stopped making the colour I was using.

175966462,"Good morning. I haven't posted here for some time now, but always value the perspectives here. I was going through GAD last year that really came about due to a couple of health issues I had to deal with. I don't have health anxiety per se, just the constant dealing with medications/doctors/tests caught up with me and was the cause. CBT/Zoloft/Klonopin helped me a lot, and basically just getting a perspective of not giving this the power I did. For 6 months I was basically GAD free until 2 days ago. With concurrent health issues flaring, I have had a few months now with many appointments and more tests and procedures. I guess when medical issues take center stage it really makes me think about my future and quality of life. Which led to the anxiety coming back full force. I let the demon in the door so to speak and started having the catastrophic thinking versus the rational thinking. Curious how people out there deal with the relapses.......and the fear that can come knowing it was not gone, but d
ormant. I guess I need to go back to the tool box of what I did to help it last time. Any experiences that can be shared would be great, thank you!"
174356773,"Hey, so I read your post the other day, and I thought I'd respond now because I have time. First, awesome that you're interested in philosophy and especially Stoic philosophy. It interests me a lot as well. I bought the _NAME_ Holiday book recently. It's pretty good! I try to post occasionally on the Crazy Philosophy forum as well. Maybe start a thread on there. I'm not sure how Stoic philosophy can apply to cope with schizophrenia. The exciting thing for me about Stoicism is that the Stoics believed that mental anxiety was only mentally created, I suppose. So then does that mean that all of our thoughts are just psychological reactions to external events? If that is true, I believe it might be quite liberating. It also is somewhat scary and contrary to my experience to affirm that thoughts are mental representations of external events. One thing that stuck with me from the Stoics when I read them in college was that when you lose a person, for example, you should treat it (mentally) like you just 
lost an object or something like that. It stuck with me because I understand that people go through quite a lot of grief sometimes, and that's completely natural, and I do not deny that people should go through grief. However, it's also true that we can move forward and become even more strong through experiences like grief. I lost a friend right around that time in which I was studying the Stoics. And when the teacher explained that, I felt a weight lift. Not exactly in that moment; I mean, it wasn't like a scripted moment from a movie or anything, but I felt a lot better after understanding that we lose people like we lose objects. I don't believe that affirming that diminishes the importance of that person we lost; however, it's just a more balanced and rational way of dealing with things, in my view. Hope that wasn't too much of a ramble, and hope that maybe we could start a discussion on Stoicism or any other topic in the Crazy Philosophy forum."
175966463,"jellyfishLane... yes yes a thousand times yes !! Thank you for posting about this very thing that’s been annoying the crap out of me increasingly. Here’s a recent one I heard someone say: “omg I could hardly breath watching that horror movie. I swear I was having a panic attack!” 20 minutes later “I’m still thinking about that creepy movie scene, I think I might have obsessive compulsive disease.” Uh.. you watched a HORROR movie.

175966477,"Lol _NAME_, no worries...the thought of ending my life was an extremely fleeting one...like maybe a few seconds. So don't worry... Very sorry to hear about your previous relationship...I'm sure you must have done all you could. *patz* I'm not sure what you meant by 'forced to be without her'...care to shed some light...? As in, perhaps she forced you to leave/divorce her...? Glad you've done fine on your own..! As for the questions...can I end the relationship with her? Can I make it on my own...? Of course! I'm a lean, mean fighting machine and can fend for myself anytime I want. But that's totally beside the point. The point is that I can't, and won't, leave my wife. I can't leave my wife because she has not committed adultery(plus God says to forgive even if so). I won't leave my wife because I love her. Why should I leave someone I love...? And even if I don't love her, I'm morally obligated to stay with her. So, emotionally and morally, there's no reason for me to leave. But then you might ask
: Why don't you put your own needs first? Why don't you leave her while you still can? Why don't you think about yourself for once? I mean, yes, these are perhaps questions that an outsider might have. But then my answer would be: Read Paragraph 4!"

They said some other family members do not want to see me when I come because supposedly I haven't been in contact with them as much. They are irritable anyway. The positive thing is that I won't have to deal with them in my trip. This is why I do not like dealing with family. There are always silly scenarios such as this.

She had 11 cats and 2-3 dogs. It freaked me out. I wanted to escape. I had so much anxiety. I never recognized the house before and I walk past it like every day. Genetics freak me out.

If I have none on hand, I will have a panic attack (been there, done that), so I will never let myself get below about 5 pills now. That is horrible the buspar gave you gut problems. Sorry to hear that. I don't want klonopin either...I don't want or need something every day. I think the doctors and government are on a power trip and not treating patients correctly. Huge mess. I HATE being treated like a drug addict when I am the exact opposite and I hate drug addicts (I unknowingly dated one off and on for 5 years and he's the reason I had to take xanax daily for years!). Something needs to change but I dont see it happening anytime soon. It doesn't make any rational sense to take someone with severe anxiety off of a low dose of a medicine they have taken successfully for years! And I don't think klonopin is that much less addictive from what I've read."

175966511,Sorry about your new roomie. That's a bummer. I hope you can move away from her soon. I'm doing okay. Just tired. I took Friday off of work but I am going to the DMV to try to get my Real ID. I hope it doesn't take all day. Hopefully I will still have time to observe Good Friday.
175966512,YES!

175966514,"Technically, I've been diagnosed with schizotypal, but I think it was a mistake: my environment was really weird, not me. MMPI and _PERSON_ tests also pointed to schizoid tendencies. My core PD being narcissistic, I first withdraw to avoid shame, and a vicious circle ensue: isolation and lack of interest in other people make me appear cold and probably a little bit strange, which make social interactions more awkward, which make me want to isolate..."
175966515,"I’ll have to go get some milk tomorrow. I want to make that _PERSON_ cheesesteak hamburger helper even though I’m afraid to cook it and cause a fire. I’ve made hamburger helper plenty of times in my last apartment, idk why but I’m just so intimidated by the stove in my new place."
175966516,"This resonates a lot with me. I still take risks, but I never bet on humans. In every way possible, I try to remove other humans from the equation. It simplifies things, both morally and emotionally. The thing I seem to struggle with is that if I help someone out, it immediately seems to turn into a parasitic relationship. If someone helps me out, I feel like they will own me, like the debt is inescapable, and it can compromise my ethics."
175966517,Lol how is shrooms a gateway drug?
175966518,"I'm not in a good mood. And I took my meds late. I woke up to a text from the apt we are in saying our date to move out was 10/11 and if we are turning in our keys today. I went from scared to angry in a matter of 30 min. But then they just said they will change it. I just hope they dont tack on fees for having to change it. And I called my mom. I havent spoke to her in 2 days. Actually 3. My aunt answered and then my mom said she was busy. She said ""you know I'm busy when I'm here in California."". I got upset. I just said ""ok whatever. I'll just talk to you when you come back to texas"". Which will be 9 days from now. Fck it."
175966519,"I know that it takes time, but i am starting to hate that answer (no offense to you at all, i appreciate the response), because it's seemingly the only thing im told when all other pieces of advice dont work. ive been waiting and waiting for it to get better and it never does. I dont think my life should have so much of it just ""pending"" until maybe stuff gets better down the line when my adolescence and young adulthood has already passed by."
175966520,"Hey there, thanks for joining Inspire! Definitely a good thing to do, I’ve recently joined and it’s so supportive and so much help is available. That is a terrible thing for you to deal with, especially dealing with these emotions alone for 7 months! I admire you for staying so strong throughout this difficult time. Your ex must have been such a manipulator, to leave you in such a sudden and shocking way, with no explanations, and taking all of your possessions! It must be so hard to live so far away from those you love and those who love you. You deserve to feel validated about your feelings, it must be so emotionally draining to deal with these feelings every day. I haven’t experienced any circumstances that you have, but I’ve heard people relate this sort of situation as an amputation. You get used to living without it, and you eventually heal, but you’re never the same. And I know it’s not something you can ‘just move on’ about, it involves a healing process and will take time a
nd perseverance. I’d recommend reaching out for support from a therapist, and I’m so so proud of you for reaching out today. I use the crisis textline 741741, since with COVID and an increase in daily duties I don’t have time to visit my therapist. Text ‘hey’ or ‘hello’ to that number and it’ll connect you to a professional (if you’re from the US). They’ve made an incredible difference in my life and have helped me so much. It’s much less anxiety than having to talk face to face with someone about what’s going on. Either finding a therapist to visit or using this textline are great options. Obviously as well as reaching out on Inspire! We’re here for you, don’t give up, you’ve got this!"

My mom went for a walk and now shes going to come back and fight with us all again, blame my dad, say ""**** you then"" to my sister and make me feel guilty. She knows that I'm paranoid about her heart and I asked her if she took her beta blocker - She said no and my sister saw her take it so she lied to me which is a really ****** thing to do. I hope my mom finds peace but she has a severe mental illness. We were on a TV show for it when I was a kid. She loved the attention. I don't know if she's going to die or what - from cancer, her heart, stress don't know what to do. She manipulated me and I love my mom so i cant help her at this point.

175966525,"oceanfisher: When years ago I was untreated for bipolar, which included depression and anxiety, decisions were difficult to make. For instance, I couldn't decide if I needed to see a psychiatrist. I was also negative, along with anxious, depressed and bipolar. Just a mental swirl, which, being negative, I didn't think I could solve. And I was right. Being negative, I couldn't solve it, so I stayed there in my apartment, pacing back and forth, until I had a nervous breakdown. So, if you have some negativity along with the anxiety, you might want to look at that. mayoclinic.org says one of the signs of anxiety is, ""Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry."" I typed in ""Anxiety and decision making"" in the search engine and Heysegmund.com said under ""How to Stop Anxiety Intruding on Decisions"": ""Be mindful. Mindfulness strengthens the pre-frontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that can be sent offline by anxiety. Without the full capacity of the pre-f
rontal cortex to weigh in on decision-making, decisions are more likely to become fixed and rigid and driven by intrusive emotions that don’t deserve the influence. Mindfulness strengthens the brain’s capacity to filter out distractions to make more grounded, relevant decisions. It limits the influence of the things that don’t matter, so you can focus on the things that do."" This above ""mindfulness"" (and being positive) are also stressed in this website's ""anxiety-panic resources"" at the top of the list of people who have written into this forum, which you might want to look at. Your situation is not unique. People have been down this road before. I'm one of them. It's good that you can reach out onto the computer, without having to leave your house, and get some websites such as this one to try and help out with the problem. We don't all have to repeat the same problems but can learn from those who have had this problem or studied it."

175966565,"S29, Morning anxiety is common and often due to Cortisol. This stress hormone makes is possible for us to get up and going in the a.m. Without it, we'd likely not get out of bed! However, those of us with anxiety either produce an excess of it, or are just particularly sensitive to its effects...and can end up having rough mornings until the levels naturally drop throughout the day. Try focusing on your coping mechanisms first thing when getting up to manage the anxiety and set a good tone for the day. Peace and progress, S.C."
175966566,"Hi Everyone, I wanted to ask a few questions and hopefully get a better understanding of what conditions I have so that when I meet with my councilor I can be treated properly. I believe there are many kind people here who can help me get started. Lately I will do something which I enjoy like fishing or reading and I can only stay focused on what I am doing for a very short time. I will drive all the way to the beach to fish which takes me an hour but after thirty minutes I am ready to leave. I never used to be this way. I used to be able to enjoy myself with my hobbies but no longer. Would that be considered attention deficit or anxiety issues? When I start reading about my cancer treatments and what others go through I fall into a panic attack. I almost shut down. It is as if I am paralyzed with fear. The meds I have tried in the past and still have at home are amitriptyline and Cymbalta. I am currently taking the amitriptyline but wonder if the Cymbalta may be a better choice. My primary care dr 
gave me the Cymbalta but because of my stomach issues which my GI dr said were giving me IBS he switched me to amitriptyline. I am interested in what anyone here thinks about my issues and what meds I should take. I realize there are no drs here but any help would be greatly appreciated. I need to understand what exactly is going on with me. I know I have a lot happening at once. Maybe I should let the councilor help me but she will not be a MD. The amitriptyline does help me but not nearly enough. Maybe I should be seeing a psychiatrist????? I started a new thread so everyone would not have to _NAME_ through my last extremely long thread.

175966571,"Hey everyone, hope you all are safe and well. Im 21yo female living in NYC. When COVID hit us and the state went into lockdown, I had multiple panic attacks. I had really intense and insane panic attacks. This happened in March and sine then i've been trying to cope with my emotions. I have anxiety but these panic attacks were nothing like i'd experienced before. But here's the thing, I have pains and its been 3 months now. I had severe lung , chest, shoulder/shoulder blades/back area pain. The pain lasted for hours at end with maybe an hour of relief. The pain has decreased now. Everyone thinks it's anxiety related. But can anxiety pain last hours on ends ( basically 24 hours and for 3 months). I had 2 chest xrays, a breast ultrasound, an EGD with biopsy, 3 EKGs , complete and thourough blood work, urine test. Every single thing has come back as normal. I had experienced insane jaw , ear, and throat pain and went to the ENT. He looked in my ears, looked in the throat, even up my nose with a camera 
and it was all normal. (I actually got diagnosed with TMJ because this pain started before the COVID crisis) Even now i'll get heart pain. I'll be watching TV and the pain will catch me by surprise. In my lungs in my chest in my back. I'll catch myself feeling breathless. I get nervous. Can this all really be anxiety? To feel pain 24/7?"

I have had chickenpox twice, believe it or not. I think you may be right there. Even so, looking at this zombie-like purplish blister cluster gives me anxiety. I got worried because of color in case if this was a misdiagnosed skin infection, getting worse. I said ""yeah this is it, I am rotting"" [UPDATE] Well I called the nurse to ask something about the medication doctor gave me and after listening to my problem she confirmed on the telephone that this is Shingles, though I don't have too much pain other than occasional burning/stabbing and needles and pins on the same side of my body. I usually trust my immune system and I don't get sick often then, of course, the first thing that came to my mind was if I had an underlying sickness that makes my immune system weak so that this virus which was dormant in my body had a chance to show itself.Post Edited (R

175966610,I told some of my RL friends that I’ve been manic. They say they were concerned about me and aren’t annoyed with me being so chatty. We chatted a bit today about things. I didn’t go into great detail just that I’ve been struggling but I’m on new meds now.

175966613,This is gonna sound stupid but I wish I had more “highs” because I’m depressed ALL. The. Time. There’s always some degree of depression in my head. I hate it so much. That’s why I originally diagnosed with schizoaffective depressive type when I was 15. And then after the paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis (when I was real real sick) I was rediagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type. But I guess it makes sense cuz I have more highs now than in my past but idk I’m still always depressed to some degree.

175966615,"I don't know what to do with myself. As time goes on, I'm beginning to see just how damaged I am. I think I may be either schizotypal or schizoid personality disorder, because of the fact I can't have mental emotions, I can't feel lonely, and a host of new problems show up because of it. I'm thinking the schizoid one... This is really bad news for me. One of the symptoms is that they can't form meaningful relationships. That's a dagger to the heart. Also, I'm seeing a lot of people heavily criticize me, im mean deep criticisms, even hatred towards me, a group actually thinks I'm satan! lol I'm more troubled than I ever realized. It's like water running through my fingers, I can't control it. My trauma has gotten better, I can still be an asshole here and there though. I'm always doom and gloom because I can't feel positive emotions. This mental illness keeps bringing me to my knees, and it weights on everyone around me. I feel like I'm just a burden, and the longer I live the more people absolutely 
*hate* me."

175966624,I talked to my therapist on the phone. She says she's going to try and find a way for me to move out. There's no services available like the ones I want in this small town where I live. She's going to try and talk to my old psychologist/psych nurse. Maybe I can live in my apartment. My mom has it in her name. I want to get the hell out of here but my mom has control over me so I don't know where this will lead. I'm going to be connected with the community services again and explain to the person that runs the social events that I'm too scared to go to them. I told my therapist that I'm afraid of new people more than ever now.

175966626,"Thank you _NAME_ They had been without insurance for a bit of time until recently. Last year a drug issue arouse with them, they went and binged hundreds of dollars on drugs in a single day.. I know if I hadn't been there their life would be one that I don't think ANYBODY would want to choose in their life. During this I reached out to agencies like you were referring to and we're wanting for them to come in but they didn't want to go that route.. I even offered to go to meetings like NA with her and maybe that could help in some way but they didn't want to do that as well.. they were set on getting through it on their own so I did all I could really do and be a support for them Thinking back I believe that was about the time or shortly thereafter that Klonopin had been self taken out of the meds they had been on. I was around a week or two ago when they finally had a video appointment with their primary. Their primary didn't feel comfortable prescribing psych meds and refered them for a psychiatri
st which has not happened yet to my knowledge. We had a disagreement at the start of the week and I have been getting the silent treatment since and no issues have been spoken about. I've told them that I feel that they are in some type of mania and I've been right about it before just from the signals I have been able to pick up on. I cant strong arm them to go or to be honest about what's going on but I see them tailspining in front of me and I just keep hoping they pull out of it or I see a chute deploy and they ask for help but I don't see ether happing and it's breaking my heart and destroying our friendship."

I thought about calling in to work but instead I got my Dad up and he made breakfast for me (I was running late because I slept in an extra hour and had to wash my hair). But I thought about calling in just so I could have a mental health day. Just zone out and watch TV and such. My weekend is going to be so busy that I feel like I need some time just to chill but I didn't call out, I came to work anyway. I still have one sick day to use for the year so I do want to use it (it is use it or lose it). But I should plan a day off. Otherwise my parents get too worried about me.

175966632,Hi everyone. Just checking in. Doing okay. Started decorating my office at work for Christmas. I know it's early but I don't care. I just got a pom pom roll and put it up around my window. I'll probably put a little tree up in November. I bought one specifically for my office. The pom pom doesn't look really Christmasy as it is green and pink and purple and blue. Really bright. I like it. My friend died this morning. He was older but he has young kids. Like IDK six and under. Left behind a wife too. I'm sad.

175966636,"So, my moms best friend _PERSON_ is trying to hook me up with this guy name _NAME_. _NAME_ and I are complete opposites when it comes to politics, interest, and hobbies. We have nothing in common but I'm trying to give him a chance. Our conversations are mundane and awkward at best. He has a hard time with reading and spelling so when we text he's always asking, ""what do you mean?"". When we talk over the phone there is constant silence and it's hard for me to gather my thoughts over the phone talking. I have to repeat myself over and over. I told him i cannot drink because of my medication yet he keeps on insisting that I drink with him some day. He told me he broke up with his girlfriend because she was talking to some other guy. I asked him if he's a jealous person. He then asked, ""what do you mean?"". I told him, ""would you get jealous if i had male friends"". He said no but i don't honestly believe him. I'm already saying ""hell nah"" to this dude... I'm about ready to pull the ""I'm not re
ady for a relationship"" card. My gut feeling tells me to run. He came over tonight at my house and we sat outside silently on our phones and not saying anything to each other for a half hour or so. Then he proceeds to tell me that Angel, my moms best friend, told him all about me. I asked him what she say about me. He tells me she said that I've tried to kill myself and I don't think I'm pretty. What the **** man. That's not something i want a potential mate to know right off the bat. I'd like to get to know him first. I honestly do not know what to think about what _PERSON_ told _NAME_. I'm not sure if I'm embarrassed or furious at _PERSON_ for telling him that. I know if i say something to my mom about it she's just going to say, ""well it's true right?"". I'm pissed right now... what the actual **** man."

175966640,"Thanks Very much for all your wishes. Yes, i am trying to get her involved with things that she likes and have nothing to do with studies etc. We are also learning to only think positive and take fear out of our minds as best possible. Hope you are well as well."
175966641,"It comes down to motives for me. My own lies with motives to harm or exploit others are not ok with me. One reason being I still try to adhere to a 12 step program (at least to a degree) and making amends / admitting I'm wrong takes a degree of courage and humility I prefer to avoid indulging in as much as possible. Personally, I have a (possibly bad) habit of not paying much attention to (or even seeing) others' lies (unless I think their motives are to harm, exploit or betray me) because I tend to value people for my interactions with them rather than the content within those interactions. It's the little quirks or unique bits and pieces that are endearing (or I admire) that make things enjoyable for me, not what someone has or has accomplished, etc. I've always thought it was important and admirable to be authentic. One benefit of authenticity is when people try to betray your confidences, there's much less to be exposed. I'm slowly beginning to see why people choose not to be authentic though. 
I'm thinking that, rather than it being a strength or beneficial, it's quite inefficient because you end up in situations where people try to attack you or ###$ with you as a result < which is a lot of energy to have to tolerate. I think learning to hide authenticity (from the vast majority) might just be the more efficient way and I'm debating trying that type of shift < might be easier to do now that I know why it could benefit me. I'm only thinking out loud here; it's something I've been reflecting upon for a long time now. Anyways, I almost never (consciously) lie unless I need a shortcut to get out of something or to get someone off my back. Having to remember different stories is too much work. Unconsciously, I lie to myself just like every single other person does < ""blindspot"" and ""unknown"" quadrants of the Johari Window Model What's funny is when people go around calling others out for this type of dishonesty while being either completely unaware that they lie to themselves too - or proud that th
ey think they can hide themselves better than others - or they really can hide (but that's still not about self-honesty). We all think we're sneakier than we are - although some are more skilled at deception than others, for sure. Manipulation also encapsulates things like the essential behavior of an infant when it cries to be fed or changed, same with teaching a kid to potty train and any other form of purposeful conditioning in behaviorism. All about meeting needs and wants. Moreover, in many situations, taking the direct route is another one of things that can take a lot of courage with sometimes unpredictable results. Nobody likes that kind of thing when it comes to needs that matter to them. As for ""sending 'pictures' to other people"" by how you present yourself (also mentioned somewhere in this thread), I've never seen that as deceit or even a lie by omission. I've gathered together a variety of experiences and a variety of traits. If someone has a desperate enough need to categorize me because I cho
ose to highlight or focus on honest selections of those experiences and traits, in order to get to paint a ""picture"" - that's their problem - not mine."
175966642,"_NAME_ said... I appreciate the response, as it gives a good indication as to where you are in this situation. I once had a problem in which I didn't know if I should move from where I lived or not. I had once seen a true crime TV show where the detective was looking at a crime and said that the original police group should not have concentrated on suspect A, and ignored subject B. That the police should have run a ""dual investigation"" and investigated both subjects. So I applied that to my problem of, should I move or should I stay? In other words, look into the possibility of moving by calling different apart. complexes as to price, etc. But also, improve your situation at your current address, so if you decide to stay that will be possible. I decided to stay, and the improvements were already done. In your case, you have a dual situation. One physical and one emotional. Why not work on both? Why not go to a general practitioner about the physical problem, and a psychiatrist about the emotional 
problem? You don't have to take any medicine that the doctor might recommend, but it would be good to get his or her opinion, and also to have a psychiatrist in case you needed one. Another thing that might be going on is that you might have negative feelings about the outcome of this. That you might be looking to stay with these problems rather than solve them. If you were raised in a negative household like I was, you might have a negative outlook on things, on problems. As in ""no way am I going to solve this problem."" You could be holding yourself back, as I was for many years. Were you raised in a negative household? I appreciate the way you think."
175966643,"So i shared my account information for my wifi I got through comcast awhile ago. It was my email with my password. I didn't think anything of it. it was My Microsoft email with the same password as the email account. I told her not to put it on the fridge because that was my email and passowrd, and I didn't want it public knowledge. anyway, someone entered into my email account like a year ago. And then yesterday, while my roommate is telling me she's cheating on her boyfriend, so far with 2 guys, she tells me that her boyfriend told her that you can track people with their email account. wtf also, The furbo she had, the doggy camera that turns on with motion dectotion, with built in mic. She said she never pointed it at the living room, and got it in December, but that's ********.

175966686,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder as well as depression and extreme social anxiety. While I only received the BPD diagnoses about 8 months ago, I have been in therapy and on meds for depression and anxiety since I was 12 or 13 (I am now 21). I don't seem to be getting ANYWHERE. I can't hold a job because I either 1. have a hug panic attack and just walk out the door and quit or 2. I am too depressed to get out of bed or can't stop sobbing hysterically. I can't keep relationships, as it feels like I have to put on a mask and act so I never feel a connection past the ""obsession"" phase. I do not have friends and I'm trying desperately to make some but everyone else is busy with their relationships, careers, kids, own hobbies and friends. I've become so angry at the world- the people who ignore my attempts to reach out, medicine for not helping, doctors for telling me I have to ""choose"" to be happy and basically just get over it...Talk therapy, DBT, 40+ meds and combinations, exercise and diet 
changes, ketamine infusion therapy, journaling, drawing, and other various grounding and coping mechanisms have left me nowhere but running in circles. Circling the drain. I am so bored with my life and fed up with this person I am that I have come to the point where I feel like only an ice pick lobotomy or ultimately ending my life is the only solution. I DON'T want to be unhappy or like this. I want to scream at everyone who says I have to change my thought patterns and brain. I KNOW THIS! But HOW?! I have been in this state for half my life, I don't know how to be OK and I don't know how much longer I can hold on."

175966715,"I went to take olanzepine, poured the pills out of the bottle into my hand, took the first one I saw. What if I took a different pill? If I decided to do that, everything would have changed. It would be different olanzepine molecules in my brain and my whole life would be different and then the butterfly effect would take over to control the physical reality of everyone in the world. We literally change reality by observing it and making decisions.. But in the end, it's all destined. It's like the past, present and future are all the same."
175966716,"Hello mamaloves, and welcome to Inspire! I have read your post here and the other one about why you came to Inspire. It seems as if you have been traveling down a difficult road, with your own problems and the problems with your son. The answer to your question is one I do not know the answer to...but wish I did! However, I do believe that in many cases the police just do not receive enough education when it comes to handling folks with mental problems....they just don't seem to be able to separate the folks who are ill from those who just want to cause trouble. I am so sorry that you son is homeless now, for that just makes everything worse for him, not to mention the worry that it brings to you. From reading your other post, I believe you are a woman of faith, so let me make this suggestion to you. How about starting a new thread (subject) telling us about him, and asking for prayers on his behalf. There are many who will support you in that need. That will also give you support, and give you an 
opportunity to make some friends."

You are a perfect example that life can get better with schiz. It's best not to talk to your mom cuz she has bpd or something.. Or she just loves you a lot idk..

175966720,"My mom kind of caught me crying so I told her why.. that I don't know why.. she said ""Do you feel sad?"" And I said ""No I feel happy"" and she said ""So like happy crying?"", I said ""No because I also feel sad"". I just think about how I had a good childhood and then it turned out horrible after that and then I tripped and I feel like my life is just starting again. I took a very high dose in the back of my ex step dads truck while he was driving.. like wtf? That's very surreal to me. And I think about the good vacations I've had with my parents and how good it was. I miss my dad (He's away working and my parents are divorced but friends again). My mom said that it's an overwhelming time for everyone and that I shouldn't cry alone. I'm not the type to cry in front of people so I'd rather do that for a few minutes and then think positively.. I just feel really peaceful right now. I've been getting positive vibes from everything. Idk if anyone else feels the same? I can't believe my mental health 
has been getting better, I'm on the right meds and I'm improving myself and learning just like how I wanted it to be throughout my depression. Things can be good within. There's horrible people in the world but I don't let them get me down."

175966729,"Not sure if there are security cameras here, but I would imagine so. Good idea. If my packages keep getting stolen, then I will ask them about cameras. But for now, I told them that no, I did not pick it up, and that the only person picking up packages is supposed to be me, no one else. Doubt they will check names the next time though. On the upside, my other packages (which were delivered later in the day) were not stolen. So now I have ring fit adventure and two 32oz bottles of Germ-X sanitizer. Maybe I will try ring fit soon."

Psychosis and PTSD is an entire series of books itself. I would only say that, if this continues, please do keep telling your pdoc. I believe there are medications that may help you. Don't give up! You are not alone!! Others here are dealing with similar stuff and making it. As Breaking Dawn says, we need to help each other. And we do here on this site. Hope you have a peaceful weekend.

175966746,I submitted a story to the mighty about my hospitalization. I hope they accept it. It was cathartic to write about it at least.
175966747,"I dont see or hear anything constantly, thank goodness. My visual hallucinations tend to be the most elaborate. Cats, bats, rats, snakes, people, bugs, then some more odd stuff like cartoon characters (only once or twice), monsters, symbols. Ive noticed that themes tend to come and go. I was seeing mostly small animals for a whilr... and then I was seeing monsters for a while... and then religious themes and symbols/demons/god... now its mostly like optical illusion stuff. Ill see a spot on the wall move in a circle or the carpet will seem like its moving- like its a carpet sea with waves. Thats all the visual stuff. The voices have taken on religious themes lately. One or two word phrases repeated. Heaven and hell/god and demons. Though theyve gotten much much rarer. Those one or two word phrases are only happening like once a week where for a while it was like... more than half of the days. “Again” is a common word repeated and one that drives me INSANE. Then dark threatening words which I ha
ve a hard time recalling when I think on them later bexause of the latent anxiety they cause. And then my name. Bells. Laughter. Angry voices. I do also wonder if I get olfactory hallhcinations because sometimes ill smell things that arent around either. But Im not sure on that"
175966748,"It's good you stayed on your other meds while you went off of the Zyprexa. I predict you'd be in another world if you hadn't stayed on your other medicines. You said, ""I wasn't sleeping for days, and I was fearful. She said that is why she put me on Zyprexa."" As a bipolar who takes Lithium and Mirtazapine anti-depressant, I have trouble with sleep, also. But I don't want to keep taking more doctor medicines if I can help it. So I try natural health food tablets for sleep, and what works for me is Melatonin. I'm on 4, 1 mg. tablets of Melatonin from the health food store, and it gets me to sleep. Sometimes, if I'm not sleeping good, I'll take 5. (I would start off with 1 or 2 of the 1 mg., and see how it goes.) Sometimes if I'm waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning and I've only had a few hours sleep, and I haven't been sleeping well, I can take one more Melatonin, because I'm thinking, the pills I took at 11 or 12 midnight, are wearing off. So by taking that extra Melatonin at about 3 or 4 a.m., it'
ll be kicking in at about 5 a.m., whereas the other meds will be wearing off. Also, I take the Melatonin about 1 hour before I go to bed, and at bedtime, I'm groggy, which is what I want. Someone on this forum said it can be taken 2-4 hours before bedtime, but I also don't want that to be wearing off at 3 or 4 in the a.m. So you might consider that, before running to the psychiatrist and she loads you up with some more doctor medicine. In addition to the Melatonin, I've also been taking my Mirtazapine anti-depressant one hour before bedtime. Mirtazapine causes muscle twitching and hunger. If I took it right when I went to bed, about an hour later, for about 5 years, my toes would start twitching (muscle spasms) and I would become so hungry I would have to get up and eat down the house. It was the side effects of the Mirtazapine. So, after 5 years of that, I decided, why not take the Mirtazapine an hour before bedtime, also, along with the Melatonin, so the side affects occur before I get into bed, not keep me 
awake an hour later? I just alert you to this in case you're having side affects of one or more of your medicines that you're taking at bedtime."

I also have issues with depression, and struggle with consequences (I logically know what consequences might follow any given action, they just don't bother me one way or the other, to an extent that makes functioning as a responsible adult a daily struggle).

So I will be out of the house for about 3 hours. After that we are going to skype. I am nervous about going but kind of anxious to get out of here for a bit. I am going to carry a mask and gloves. It really is for our own good. I think it is helping to do social distancing. This is suppose to be the worst week I guess. I wonder how they figure that out. But I guess they pay attention to how it went in the countries before us. Scary and depressing it is. I walked my dog in the yard today and looked at my flower beds. I have a few things poking through. But my favorite spot still has a foot of snow. I think it is because I have a grape vine there and it shades the flower bed.

So tired of sadness and anxiety. Updated my resume and joined a career counseling group paid for by my former employer today. Uploaded my resume for tweaks. Don't feel like moving towards obtaining employment but at the same time know staying home grieving all day and night is not beneficial to me. Wish I had a magic wand. Husband is still grieving with anger and it's hard to be around him. Walking on eggshells. Nothing I do is right. Resentment is building. Every day is the same. Don't even know what day of the week it is anymore. Figured out it's the weekend- who cares. Sitting here just waiting for my grief counseling chat to start. Every night I go.

It's just the fact that I am unstable to other people and it feels like they get mad and frustrated with me. It's like I'm not allowed to be mental. It's like I have to abide to society and stability. In other cultures, shamanism understands. It's ok to have a mental breakdown and it's a spiritual thing full of love. Society really screwed us over... Capitalism.. Homeless people, drug addicts.. It's really ****ing tragic.. Mental illness is a symptom of something really wrong. We're smart people but get screwed over by the evil in the world. If only I had people that understood and.. The fact that I'm so rhetorical in my words and posts with humour makes me feel alone.. Like I'm not being taken seriously because 
I don't want to... I don't know what to feel about it. I don't want to make a big deal about my mental illness so I downplay it and glorify my creativity and philosophical thoughts like art when really I'm in pain. Like an artist making something, painting, drawing, singing.. It's just a thing from an unknown force where it doesn't come from the person.. I never take responsibility for what my ego makes..

175966795,Hi I hope you feel better soon as health anxiety sucks. I have health anxiety all the time and have convinced myself that I have had all sorts of deadly/terminal illness and yes getting sick can really make your health anxiety worse. _PERSON_
175966796,That's great! and I hope you get the job!
175966797,"Yes, I took my meds for today."
175966798,"Hey, Yeah my whole flat has been overdue for ages. Now I’ve been cutting back the alcohol I’ve been able to do more with my days. How are you?"
175966799,What kind of computer are you thinking about getting Valley?
175966800,Crazy like a few years ago I drank every day whenever I could so I wouldn’t feel. I think it was for like a month. I couldn’t tell you if I was depressed or hypomanic but I was unmedicated. When I snapped out of it I had the shakes for a while. I don’t want to be that bad again. I was also abusing cough syrup and lorazepam too so I’m surprised I was able to function. Ugh I hate this ****.
175966801,"I feel pretty good today. Staying up all night since I have to be up early for my haircut appointment. I'm happy. Things are good in my life. I'm thankful. That's what I focus on, everything I have to be thankful for."
175966802,"I shopped online today at Target.com for some toys for the children at my Church that I am sponsoring for Christmas. SO MUCH FUN! Goodness, they have SUCH cool toys nowadays. I wish they had some of these when I was young."
175966803,I legit cant focus on much. My head is stuffy.
175966804,Be careful ghosting. Theres a new tv show on mtv that finds the people that ghosted other people. idk. Most likely nothing will happen to you tho. I'm prob just paranoid.

175966807,"Hi. I’m so sorry to hear this. My daughter had Lymes disease when she was in 6th grade. It went undiagnosed for about 3 months but devastated her health. She developed alopecia(including eye lashes eye brows gone) and had chronic headaches and joint pain for years. I also ended up having her take doxycycline two different times for 21 days each because she seemed to get the symptoms again. Changing her diet to more clean eating helped. 3 years after her hair fell out, it began to regrow. Her hair is long now with one stubborn area in the back that grows super slow. I took her to a neurologist who diagnosed her with migraines. He put her on a med for migraine and it has helped. Today, she is a senior. She has depression. She struggles in school. I understand your pain and frustration. Please don’t consider suicide. Are you able to work? Maybe try cutting sugar and carbs out of your diet. Work out and jog. eat good carbs found in veggies. Do you think a dr would order iv doxycycline? It could hel
p. Idk. I wanted iv doxycycline for my daughter but no one would order it. Maybe find a tick dr specialist? I’ll be praying for you!"

175966808,"I want to go somewhere fun like a holiday. I might be going to Mexico to visit my dad in November. If not, my mom will come with us in December when she's done radiation. She finds out tomorrow I think if she has to do chemo. But also I need to focus on learning about investing to become overnight success in ~10 years. Many skills to be learned and variety of colourful actions instead of being a dead zombie. But I just can't focus. I took a Vyvanse but it calmed my thoughts down. My thoughts were really nice and completely perfect when I took a vyvanse with an energy drink while hiking. I made like 5 scientific discoveries just by walking and meditating but forgot what I was thinking about. I always forget what I'm thinking about. My mind is a constant thought machine making a string chain of thoughts that goes on forever and ever. I'm constantly entertained by my thoughts that I don't need anything to entertain me. But I'm addicted to music because my frequency is that of music. My mind works in m
usical repetitive beats and lyrics. My thoughts are lyrics. My mom and sister are going to a vollyball tournament and it funds breast cancer <3 I'll be alone for 2 days."

175966811,My English toffee cappuccino mixes and biscotti will be here next week!
175966812,I think a lot of it worked like a laxatives. whatever I ate... about half hour later I'm on the toilet. But also I stop craving junk food that I ate at my ex's place I was living with after moving back in with my moms.
175966813,That happened to me at work as well. I'm usually sensitive to when I think people are talking about me..
175966814,Way to go!
175966815,"Most days recently snapchat has been dead. Every once in awhile someone will post. It used to be really active. Mostly now its just desoxyn posting to himself. I dont have a lot of time to be on social media much anymore. Only when I'm off really. And even then I get busy now on my days off. Today has been the only day where I've had a lot of time to relax, in 2 weeks."
175966816,I’m feeling nauseous.....I’m not sure if it’s anxiety or if I’m getting what the bf has.....the incubation period is about a month and that’s when we saw each other last.....
175966817,"I used to be able to write, I think I just got stupider on my medications. It's like reading. I used to be able to read really fast. Now I usually lack the motivation to read. It's really sad."
175966818,"i left them out because they are embarrassing, but i guess u right. they are somewhere between cutting edge technology and sci-F. they start from me studying/understanding all majors fields in sciences like theoretical physics engineering(all kinds), general AI, robotics, neurology, gen-editing etc... and have all kind of break through, after that create some $#%^ like self-replicating system that can help me create even more stuff without much input from me that are self-stained and function in all environment (space, earth etc...) create an empire a collections of stations in space that host stuff like armies, factory or space odyssey that have bio-garden and even city, gen-_USER_ID_ to improve my body (live forever etc...), create semi-conscious robots in which i can control them by thoughts basically become co-conscious with all robots, create a new robotic/gen-edited body-forms that will not be self aware within themselves but rather will become a collection that serve as a platform to extend 
my conscious into the next state, in which group can dissociate and still function as me by choose or by technical problems like communications(i don't know why this part have to be realistic) only then to reintegrate back into me where i can be multi-conscious at the sometime, also to give me the ability to control my mind like understand everything is happening inside and how to control it if i wish to, also those body-froms will pack all kind of sci-f superpowers like teleportation/telekinesis/shape-shift/mind-control/nuclear powered etc... also there is self-sex group fantasy for some reason. PS: body-froms have the two genders cause am not sexist XD i will experience thing from both end. but the point here is i think most schizoid have rich fantasy but what do u guys do if that was the only drive or thing u give a $#%^ about in life. life is kinda dull, silly and pointless without those unrealistic fantasies."

175966821,"Try to get outside and safely enjoy whatever amenities are available in your community. Just a walk to the corner and back, is a nice break with bonus of Vitamin D. Also provides opportunity to say hi to your neighbors. Perhaps consider adopting an adult pet, if you have the resources and enjoy animal companionship. You might consider also volunteering with a local non-profit (perhaps _USER_ID_) that would benefit from your skill set and provide you an opportunity for social interactions and service to your new community. It's not easy to live with depression, especially in a new environment in the middle of a pandemic, so Be kind to yourself."

175966825,"Bipolar 2 sucks. I was diagnosed about 20 years ago now (though I may be bipolar 1 or NOI (not otherwise indicated) now). It took nearly 15 years for me to get ahold of it, so maybe I can share some techniques that I've learned recently that seem to be of at least a little help. 1. Talk to your family members. My mom did similar things and I had to sit her down and have a discussion with her about how not only does the joking not help, it hurts the problem. 2. Have you tried any 5-senses techniques? For example, to stay in the moment, I may pick up something (literally anything) and start to actively note how it feels, smells, looks, sounds, and maybe even how it tastes. I have found that actively engaging in a 5-senses exercise, I'm able to come out of the exercise and not disassociate as much. 3. Find what I like to call ""moments of muchness"". These are spaces, art, music, or anything that can give me a sense of appreciation for the real world. I find that if I engage in finding things in the r
eal world that help me, it also helps me mitigate the disassociation. Also, there is a decent list of grounding techniques here. https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques. It will likely take some time to find the one that works for you, but don't get discouraged! Good luck with everything."

175966832,"Morning I feel like I can taste my bones popping. Like as if it’s giving off a smell when it’s popped/cracked. Like how dogs nails smell when you file them down or something. Like dusty smelling, and old smelling. I think I’m just smelling my morning breath tho"
175966833,Quiet today
175966834,Chicken nuggets
175966835,I think thinking about things like this is very important otherwise we’d be living a life without truly living it. What are we without a meaningful goal? Just wandering around aimlessly. Though we need to be careful not to fall into depression.
175966836,"_PERSON_, I was in a horrible state hospital for almost 5 years for something I did not even ever do. I totally realate to your feelings. I do. Hang in there. There are thousands of Americans who have been through a similar thing."
175966837,I'm looking forward to buying another of your books.
175966838,Same. If your using tapatalk its probably notifying u because its delayed. Sometimes by a lot. It's happening to me too.
175966839,Hahaha why does everyone laugh when I say “have you exercised”
175966840,Does anyone else see themselves in 3rd person? I don't experience life. I'm just a spectator. Is this dissociation?
175966841,Me too you can come talk to me anytime you like.
175966842,"I’ve made many conscious efforts to not lie, it still happens at times but it’s usually Little white lies that don’t have a negative intention. Like telling someone what they want to hear because you just don’t care and want out of the conversation politely. I try to not do that very much either, I’ve always sort of admired people who hold themselves high standards even when it’s in their best interest not too. I’ve noticed these types of people generally have a strong character and tend to not follow the crowd just because it’s easier. My instincts are to follow the path of least resistance which is usually not the best way. From what I have witnessed I’ve dealt with some really good liars and deceivers. Not all have bad intentions but once I realize that you are a liar your credibility is permanently scarred and I won’t take anything you say seriously after that. People will understand and respect someone who owns up to their mistakes and look down on those who try to pass the 
buck"

175966844,It’s online but so far so good I still have more to do....it’s like weekly modules.
175966845,"Not yet! I keep thinking I'll do it ""tomorrow"". Today I thought I'd do it ""today"" until I heard the announcement that kielbasa is for dinner, which is one of the few things I like here, so maybe I won't order in today. Unless a small pizza is actually small. On Friday we (all the residents) got KFC take out and it took me until yesterday to start feeling hungry again. So... I don't know. How are you doing today?"

175966847,"Coloring and/or drawing is very helpful for me I'm finding, especially when I feel agitated. I put my headphones on, listen to music and get into it. It's doing something physical which requires focus"

175966851,I hate taking my prn.... Due to the fact that it increases prolactin if I have it every day.... But it gets rid of the voices. I had an especially difficult finish to a T session. It took 20 minutes longer to bring myself out of psychosis. I went over. I felt bad bit I wasn't in any shape to move for a good 10 minutes. Now I want sui again because I hate how the session went. And that just frustrates me more. What was worse was I drove home after that and didn't wait because I knew the med was at home and had to get there. I used a mint to suck on and cold air to stay grounded. T said he would call and check on me but that's been a while now. I don't want to say about the sui thoughts I dot want to go back to the hospital. I have to be careful what I say. I hate this!!!!! Does it get any better? T pointed out some difficult things to hear or even think about.
175966852,Can you text or email your therapist? Maybe you could binge watch something on Netflix or other TV shows/ movies. Or do some arts and crafts. Get into a good book
175966853,"Slept decently, restless, but okay overall. I feel okay, but the pattern has been, pretty good for an hour or two, and then, begin to feel like crap. So, we will see. Need to get some stuff done today. Maybe today will be a bit better. I hope so. I try not to ever lose hope for the possibility of improvement. You just never know with this crazy illness what is going to happen next.. No voices or paranoia so far today. Hurray. Hugs an strength to everyone. I hope you all have good days."
174357311,I’ve embraced calling myself a far ***. Lately I’ve been eating a lot more than I have been. I’m probably between 180 - 190 right now. Hopefully the clozapine doesn’t make me gain too much weight.

175966859,"Of the words you listed, indifference is the closest, but it's not exactly right. The best I can come up with is distraction. A distraction from the continuum of thoughts, ideas, voices, music and images that's always running in my head. Annoyance is another. Yap yap yap. I'm not interested. But the correct answer might have something to do with a fear of intimacy, as well as a distorted sense of what intimacy means. Simple eye contact is sometimes too intimate for me. I don't like exposing myself to others. People have said to me ""You're so quiet. What are you thinking about?"", which to me translates as ""Describe your penis in 1,000 words."" Not that I'm always thinking about my penis, but that's the only analogy I could think of."

175966867,"Hello everyone! Thank you for your responses. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ it sounds like you are both reporting and suggesting similar ideas. It seems like the mess of having to fish through all the phone calls and appointments to find the right service is a deterent. For clarification, would a local community person available by phone with knowledge of all services in your area like a social worker be helpful? Sometimes when you call insurance companies, they cover such a huge area that they are unfamiliar with services in your area. A person in this position would serve those in need and not a third party. _NAME_. Hello and thank you for sharing. I am sorry to hear that those facilities are run in that manner. I certainly agree that mental health is often treated with medication before other avenues of treatment are attempted. It seems like this would just dull the problem but not address it completely.

rvices? Best wishes!"

174357315,"Hey minnesota thank you for your reply. Is what you are trying to say is that by taking Adderall you are allowing your brain to essentially fix what you said happened to your central nervous system. Would you believe that the same thing would apply to me that by taking something it will allow for the healing of my brain so that I dont feel the physical sensations that I do on a daily basis. I stumbled across an article the other day that I thought I should share. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/happiness-in-world/201003/psychosomatic-symptoms%3famp. Does this article seem to make sense/relate to my situation. I for one believe that it does and since reading it and reading your comment Minnesota it has opened up my eyes to the idea that I need/should take something to rewire my brain back to normal so to say. I do have to say that I am starting to feel a little bit more positive in regards to taking medication after hearing that all of you take it and I havent been alert 
_NAME_ by any of you that you have been permanently damaged by taking something. On another note, after telling my psychiatrist a long time ago my situation he felt it best to start me on a antipsychotic Abilify. Should I continue to see him if he suggested this to me. I remember having an issue with the fact of taking an antipsychotic if I feel anxious but he assured me that he didn't think I was psychotic but that my thought process and way of thinking were flawed in that I believe that there is something wrong with me although I had tests done that were all normal."

175966878,Last year I was searching up volunteering at concerts/music festivals etc and making connections like finding friends or travelling the world. Now everyone's inside and it's video calls and w/e
175966879,"Thanks so much for sharing. Stream of consciousness is the best to write out and read. I totally feel the bubble thing. As friends have come in and out of my life throughout the years I've recently been feeling it a lot more, like ""does anyone REALLY know me? Am I just showing different parts of myself to different people to conform to what I think they want me to be like?"" That's the hardest for me. Having my mom's support has been essential - I hope you can find some support from your family as well. If you can't, there are resources available like this site, and hotlines. I would really recommend therapy - it helped me sooooo much with social anxiety. I never realized how much I was thinking in circular thoughts about what other people thought of me. I had a couple breakdowns but they honestly felt really good because I was letting so much out that I never had before. Thanks again :)"
175966880,"Making tacos again. We make tacos like once a week hahaha. Make our own corn tortillas, own mango salsa, and this time we have chipotle ground pork. Yuuummm. Cooking the tortillas right now can’t wait!"
175966881,"That's good. It helps to establish an easy routine, like sleep at night and don't stay up all night. And eat at the same times everyday."
175966882,"Idk why but I just did some art and writing in my Brooklyn art sketchbook project. Idk all this stuff just came out of me about my past. I wasnt even thinking about it. I was thinking about being bored and then I decided to trace my hand in the book. And before I knew it, all the fingers on the hand, I wrote my past in each finger. Like a summary. Starting with my thumb being my childhood. Hm. Subconscious."
175966883,"Please. That video was specifically edited to make these choads look as foolish as possible. Perhaps that one girl with the complexion like an open wound will one day have sewn her wild oats and become a healthcare worker and do her part to stem the spread of the next pandemic. Perhaps the boy with fetal alcohol syndrome will one day write a great novel of hope that instills a sense of altruism in enough people to change the world for the better just a little bit. But I doubt it. Listen to their cadence, their vocabulary. Based on what is presented here, they are clearly morons. I agree, however, that being 22 is indeed the time to be stupid and f**k up (although ideally, it is wiser to go through this phase before you turn eighteen, if you know what I mean), but these people are by all appearances intrinsically stupid and will likely move on to become part of the system you and I decry. I'll bet the steam most of them are blowing off in Florida isn't much more than a fart of hot air. They are ther
e because that's what they've been led to believe they're supposed to be doing. Had I gone to college, I would most certainly have run as wild on spring break..but I'd probably have been robbing their hotel rooms while they were out partying."
175966884,Yep! Sure did!
175966885,"I slept late today, so I didn't get to the doctor yet again. It's a little ridiculous that they require you to be at their door at 7am, especially when I have to walk part of the way and take the bus so I'd have to get up at 5 and leave the house around 6. I'd say I'd try again tomorrow but it's been 3 days in a row I haven't gotten myself there so idk."
175966886,"I was gonna say this. If there’s an incentive later on I’m more inclined to get something done. Otherwise, no incentive, no point. But the incentive can be something even like binging tv for awhile."
175966887,Sorry for your experience....hugs....
175966888,Personally I found it difficult to work from a book....I just didn’t understand how I was distorting reality until someone told me...Like a lot of anxiety is spiraling thoughts and if you figure out how to deal with them it never escalates. If you can’t find a T that does cbt then the next best thing is the woebot app.

I wasn't baptized at the time, but we all went through the same class. I'm pretty sure you have to go through it whether your baptized or not. On Easter I was baptized and confirmed while the people who were already baptized were just confirmed."

I'm already down to 5mg abilify and 20 paxil, it sucks having to wait when you're struggling and need help, and the meds that help you are right there but you can't take them"
175966894,"Thank you so much for your support, I have started to go outside and walk, I actually drove by the beach as well, even if is just seeing it makes a difference. I think that since I don’t go out of my house at all you know is what complicate things more. I have stopped watching news as well. Taking it a step at time...get my tools out and start using them"

175966897,_AT_MENTION_ Why is your 2nd shot not until late August? We got our 2nd shot in two weeks.
175966898,"Just took my first dose of Fanapt, 1mg."
175966899,I slept for like 15 minutes then woke up and wide awake now wth. Might just stay awake and do laundry and gardening. I think my chili plants have more chilies by now. And I want to change the plants that I have in a vase in my room.
175966900,"omg there are some adorable plushies of toothless and light fury from how to train your dragon on the build a bear site. I need to get one haha I don't care how old I am, they're so cute"
175966901,Morning folks How has your week been? Check in if you have the time. I’m still going through withdrawal from the Olanzapine and Diazepam it’s been 2 months now since I stopped so wondering when it will end??. I have awful insomnia and nothing seems to help I’m just going to have to ride it out and hope things improve. _PERSON_
175966902,Glad you are back home _AT_MENTION_ So sorry you went through that episode. Sorry _AT_MENTION_ that you had that experience at that place! I hope it doesn't set you back.
175966903,If you want to get really creative you can carve a hole with teaspoon in the top of the cupcakes and fill with marshmallow cream then frost to cover the hole. I made chocolate cupcake like that once they were so good.

175966905,Hopefully it will. Good luck. We are moving up to a townhome that is double the size. 2 story.
175966906,Oscillate yourself tonight When you're in your bed Assimilate the dopamine Passing through your head..
175966907,An hour and a half until my appointment. Half an hour till I leave to go there
175966908,Talking about my cat makes me happy
175966909,"Fell asleep at 5am Really good sleep. Didn't take the Restoril or any benzo. I set my alarm for 11am, took the 50mg Vyvanse and then set my alarm for 12pm.. Then I slept again and set my alarm for 1pm.. All these two hours I was having intense dreams and REM sleep. I feel much better for sleeping those two extra hours while on the Vyvanse. I'll go to bed tonight at 2am. See? Told you this would get better.."
175966910,"I guess that the best way to respond is with love. If you make a big deal out of it, she will just get worse. It sounds like you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Wrestling her could make situations worse. She or you could accidently get hurt real bad. It is hard to watch though at the same time without stepping in. I guess trying to remain calm would be very important. I agree with hiding knives or anything that could potentially become a tool for her self harm. You may not be able to handle this long term. I don't think anybody could. But if you can't, don't feel guilty.. You have done the best that you can. Make sure to take care of you too. Her behavior is unacceptable in all situations. But what can you do? Nothing until you can get insurance and get her help. I really think she needs hospitalization and serious counseling. Proper meds and somebody to make sure she takes them. That is too much for any one person to do. I am really sorry for your situation. Just know you are doing the 
best that you can. I hope you get some help with this situation. Again, hang in there... Hugs, _NAME_..."
174357387,"I am feeling really stressed out! I have too much work to do for preparing for my lessons. I am overwhelmed and feel really out of it! The people I'm working with keep asking me to do favors for them too. I don't think I should say yes anymore. I'm tired and exhausted!! I don't feel right!! I will need to teach my last lesson tonight and sleep. Hopefully, I will feel better tomorrow!!"

175966912,"Hi _PERSON_! This week has been rough, anxiety, heat and allergic bronchitis. I am cool again, anxiety is gone for the most part and bronchitis is on the mend nicely. The only new thing right now is the fact that my food got stuck in my esophagus just a little bit ago. That for me is normal. I have been playing my Nintendo 3ds a lot lately, but my hands get so sore that I have to stop so often. I can not wait til Aug 13th to see a neuro doctor. Well off for a nap, went out and over did it a bit. Hope all is well"
175966913,So I programmed the new coffee maker we bought yesterday to make coffee at 8am and fiance didnt know they could do that. But this was a 15 dollar old style coffee maker. Like a regular one. I'm pretty sure programmable coffee makers have been around since the 90s or early 2000s. Lol. I never did it til this morning tho. Lol.
175966914,I wrote out my Christmas cards last night and got them addressed and stamped. My dad was going to take them to mail them for me today! I feel accomplished. Yeah!

175966920,Ask them....they either will or will not have one available
175966921,Thanks _NAME_. Glad you are having positive results with your Lexapro. It has worked well for me until a few months ago. I am hoping the increase will be all I need. It is up and down so far. I wish you continued improvement.
175966922,"Work is slow today, like usual, so I am reading a book called Willow. I've read it before. I think it's actually a YA book but I like it anyway. At least it's distracting me while I wait for the consultant to get back to me on my questions about his questions for work."
175966923,"I just got new windows that I can open fully from the inside of my bedroom. I’m going to put a chair near them so I can sit there to get more sunlight. I naturally have a much paler skin than most people in my country, add the fact that I don’t get enough sunlight, I look like a vampire near them."

175966934,"Feel free to vent to me. I don't know if I am in a similar situation or not but I do struggle with general anxiety and social anxiety and I worry about the future all the time. I can see how you would struggle even more now that you have 2 jobs; I only have one and I feel like I can barely handle that. I really only have my family to talk to also and it's hard to. We have never been the kind of family to actually talk about important things. I'm pretty sure my family members would like want to run out of the room if I started sharing something emotional haha, it sucks."
175966935,"I’m shaking. Idk why. Like trembling, my hands. And we don’t have any more bottled water. Got some from the tap but I don’t think I’ve had but very little water in the past couple of days. It could be why I feel bad. Been living off soda and coffee. May be why I’m shaking."
175966936,Slept for 17-18 hours to make up for the time I woke up at 6am for 3 days in a row to go to work. I think that might be my new normal (To sleep all day Sunday evening and Monday morning). I didn't even have to take a zopiclone.

175966946,"I hear you for sure! And completely agree. It also bothers me when someone says a comment about their excitement and how they “almost had a panic attack”. An example is a person who rode a _USER_ID_, was all smiles and happy, but then said something such as “that was so awesome, I almost had a panic attack” right after they get off the ride. Uh, no ? On the flip side of your post, I also really don’t appreciate it when people use a label to describe me, wether I have the condition or not. When they say “ugh you’re so ”.

175966955,"BB, do you feel sedated after taking Trileptal? Does the sedation go away? Honestly, I hope it doesn't. The Trileptal I think is helping me sleep. I haven't taken any Benadryl for a few days. After I take the Trileptal I get a bit tired, but it's not overwhelming. I can't tell weather it's because it has a sedating effect or that I'm actually really tired. It's more sedating than any other med I've taken."

175966957,"So sorry you are going through this. I know it can be hard to exercise with severe anxiety (and RA), but can you go on walks at all or walk on a treadmill? I just know when I exercise, even a little, it seems to help my appetite. Maybe even something like doing some yoga at home from a YouTube video? Can you do fruit smoothies? That would be a healthier option than the carnation drinks. Just thought maybe those would be easier to go down too if you can handle the instant breakfasts. Good luck, you are going through a lot."
175966958,"Greetings. I am not diagnosed as of right now, so I hope that it is still okay for me to post here on this section of the website. If not, I will leave - no problem. I will describe myself as having 'Schizoid traits' for now, since I want to be accurate. I will not change this until I have a professional diagnosis, even if I'm sure that I have the disorder. I simply wanted to match up my experiences with others who feel the same way as I do. Not necessarily talk to them, but... I want to read their well-written thoughts and ideas and possibly respond with my own (I guess that is just communication though, isn't it?). I never knew that Schizoid Personality Disorder existed until I went and did some research on my own. I personally feel as if professionals may misdiagnose me because of possible miscommunication or some other issue, but hopefully that will not happen. I plan to get a personality/psychological evaluation with an appointment some time in December, since that was the only appointment (ou
t of several that I have to go to) that was available. To anyone who has gone through these assessments - what is it like? What should I expect? The first time I looked at the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, I simply thought that it described me perfectly. I am rather unemotional and bland, though I do put on a mask around others just so that I do not seem rude or get questioned (""are you okay? Are you sad/angry?""). I can still feel, it is just rather rare and not obvious at all. Others cannot tell how I have felt in the past, and an ex-lover described me as a ""robot."" The emotions I vaguely feel most often would be humor and annoyance. Even then, it is usually for a very brief moment before returning to that same level of nothingness. The feeling is almost like contentedness, but if that was more uncaring and apathetic. I have difficulty with empathy at times where it may be appropriate, and I would prefer to do things alone. I have two people I would consider 'friends' - but we talk maybe once a month at bes
t, and even then I get tired of it rather quickly. I remember even back in middle school I realized that the way I experienced emotion was different than others. I had went online and had taken 'tests' to see if I was a psychopath/sociopath, since that was the only thing I knew from the media where there was a lack of emotion involved. Of course I did not fit the typical criteria (such as impulsiveness, disregard of rules, aggression, manipulation, etc.) so I thought all was well. If only I knew how to use my head and research better as a kid. I get bored extremely easily, and I only do things because I have to (or it distracts me). I don't enjoy many things, which is why I start and stop them rather quickly. I'm not necessarily bothered by this. I'm doing my entire first year of college/university during my last year of high school and I don't feel motivated towards any degree path. I've taken the interest tests, and answer uninterested for pretty much every category possible. Nothing seems to truly intrigue 
or excite me in any way. The classes are boring (even though they are a normal difficulty) and I do the minimum amount I can to keep an A or B in everything. I am unsure if a professional will diagnose me with a personality disorder even if I have all of the symptoms. Isn't there some type of rift within the psychological field about diagnosing people under the age of 25 with personality disorders? It has been far longer than a year since I have been this way. It is not something that can be chalked up to depression or anxiety or anything similar - because I'm not continuously 'down.' I have dealt with both in the past several years prior, and this is not that. This is something below. Something that feels like a baseline in my personality and brain. I'm not happy nor sad. There is somebody directly in the bloodline above me who acts rather overt, and another covert - I'm guessing if there is a genetic factor, that those two on the same side of the family have transferred this directly to me. Can somebody be 
diagnosed with this when they are younger (and have you)? I feel as if I am rather overt (and I hate to say a ""special case"" in late teens - but that may actually be true). People in my family think that my personality and behavior is odd, and often tease me about acting like an ""old man."" If anyone knows more about younger people getting a diagnosis, I would be interested if you told me about your experience. This moved from an introduction rather quickly, didn't it? I apologize. I did not mean to make it so long and off-topic - but I feel as if it will do. Hopefully this forum will provide useful input from others with this disorder/traits of the disorder. See you around."
175966959,I called for an early appt with my pdoc. They wanted me to come in next Tuesday but I have to work 40 hours that week. Its gonna have to be the week after. But then the week after that is my regular appt. Oh well.
175966960,Why not bb? I mean why dont u have much of a life?
175966961,Girl I do that stuff too. I clean all the time when I’m in my head just so I don’t say something that will start an argument for no reason
175966962,"As I decide what to say, my options are infighting with each other.. judging as to motive and intent. It's probably best to just keep to myself and stop trying to reach out to others.. that I'll only do harm no matter how much I wish to help, that I'll always leave the world a worse place than a better one as hard as I try. In many ways I don't think I can understand your pain because I'm dying of my own.. but it just occurred to me that we could be considered opposites, and yet still struggling in very similar ways. It's almost laughable how much it doesn't even matter what we think, how we perceive ourselves and what we want to change because then we're just as likely to want yet something else. I can't speak for anyone else, but this depression of mine seems to be like a fire in the wind.. uncontrollable, spreading, angst and dissatisfaction with how my life has turned out. Yearning for connection and sense of purpose and yet all I can manage to desire to do is just sleep it all away until I'm g
one. Don't want.. that's what I think I feel right now.. no matter what is, I don't want it anymore. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of hoping beyond the odds that things will change. I'm tired of failing without any sense for what will finally work for me. What I think I want is someone to be able to call up and talk to but everyone's so busy all the time. I don't want to get in their way, and I don't mean to get in yours either.. so forgive me. It just stuck me reading your words that it's the negativity itself that must be fought because it doesn't matter if you're lonely or just want to be left alone, depression has a special place in hell for us all, if we let it."
175966963,I only took my Rx again today.
175966964,That's exactly what I want to order from Uber eats except adding a chocolate shake and a super size Coke with ice. ?
175966965,Yes i have plus antibiotics and a pain pill
175966966,"I am sorry, _NAME_. I have tried to follow the situation with your friend but do not fully get the whole story. How are you feeling in terms of your illness stuff? Are you still IP? Sending hugs and strength. You can do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
175966967,This is EXACTLY how I feel right now. All of this.
175966968,I ended up taking one tonight
175966969,Took one in the morning
175966970,Do you have a resource you use for mindfulness?
175966971,"Well, I went to 3 stores today and got most of my shopping done for the next week, got 10,000 steps in already and it's only 9:30 in the morning"
175966972,Got another email of someone wanting me to be an influencer for them. That’s the 3rd business email I got recently about that.
175966973,This pisses me off to no end. My dad has to take this woman home and meet her kids halfway which halfway is 1.5 hours one way. Fcktrds. It’s already 8pm.
175966974,"I don't have any tips but I've recently learned that I do have social anxiety. I've always been very ill at ease in social situations. I always thought it was part of my bipolar or something. I didn't know it had a special name. I do OK one on one, but if a third person comes up, I cannot function. I like to stand up at such times. Once at a function I was sitting on a sofa between two people and was frozen, couldn't converse with either one and couldn't leave because I was sitting down. And it was in my apartment. Where was I going to go? Another time, someone said, ""Sit down!"" and relax is what they meant. I understand it now, and would be less likely to enter into such. But coming through that stage of my life when it was difficult to avoid those occasions had its rough parts."
175966975,I think I'm gonna stay on the perphenazine (trilafon) instead of getting off it. I think it's going well combined with the abilify injection. So my current meds will be: Wellbutrin 300mg Zoloft 200mg Trileptal 1200mg Perphenazine 16mg Abilify Maintena 400mg and Klonopin 0.5mg prn up to 2 times a day as needed
175966976,Plus you take some of the most gorgeous photos!
175966977,I have many stresses in my life also. My stress makes my chronic pain worse. I know you may not want to up your Lexapro but if it helps you then its worth it. A few months ago my pain management dr said something which absolutely floored me. She said I WOULD NEVER come off opiate pain meds. Just the thought of that scared me to death. Because of having cancer and all the invasive treatments I have gone through my pain is really spiking. I let it worry me till one day I said I am just sick of worrying all the time. I don't care if I take pain meds everyday of my life if I can live my life with less pain. It more important for quality of life in my opinion. God bless you all
175966978,Feeling tired.

175966982,"Don't give up @ Kit. If Vyvanse helps you, you have to let your doctor know and make sure that the pharmacies are doing their job properly. I remember in the psych ward, the nurses would never give me olanzepine when I really needed it. It took around 3 times for my doctor to tell them that when I need it, to give me the olanzepine."
175966983,I feel you love
175966984,I used to be kind of a hard *** with grading when I was a TA. Now I’m like do they have the basic idea or not... Totally mellowed. I hate grading though it seems not to be important for learning....

175966986,"I'm doing well, I'm still working and taking care of myself. I'm dating again in two days to a man who is healthy and decent. Who says life gets worse with age? I feel absolutely fabulous!! I wish others well too!! I have had some dips with my illness though but endured them. I have been compliant with my medication for three years now. I feel great!!"
175966987,I am feeling much more resolute today. That is a good thing.
175966988,"_PERSON_ said... Hi TMO, Yeah I think it is the anxious brain that still makes you focus on your leg and even though you know that it got better, you may still feel slight sensations there because you are focusing on it. I am pretty sure it will disappear soon. Please stay away from Google. Stop searching. I know. I know. I need to practice breathing and mindfulness. I went grocery dropping and felt no pain as I was walking around the store."
175966989,I edited my answer to add more. That's all I have for you.
175966990,"I’ve felt the happiest when I was traveling too. Different cultures is very interesting and refreshing. It might give us some new insights and perspectives. Enriches our life. One thing I find really hard to deal with is stagnation. But that was probably why I was given this illness, to teach me to have patience. I’m still working on myself too. I will get there one day. Traveling is indeed more fun with friends. If I travel alone I might get stuck in my head busy analyzing things. Which isn’t that bad only less fun. I have a good ENTJ friend, she’s all about work work work, keeps using her logic instead of her heart. She said I’m making her using her heart more and I told her that she’s making me using my logic more because I’m her opposite, like yin and yang. It’s a healthy friendship for both of us. We’ve been friends for a year now."
175966991,Happy birthday!

175966997,Oatmeal w/ cinnamon
175966998,Got my hair cut/trimmed. Managed to refrain from doing anything to harm myself like the voices wanted. The voices are still there but they seem a little more muted today so maybe this is a good thing.

174357530,"My 27 year old son was just diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and he has some of the same obsessions with things he reads online. He also believes the politician sex trafficking conspiracies, and he gets so mad at me because he says I don't care. He researches the Illuminati for days at a time and even has times that he fully believes he is part of a secret society. As a parent, I want to fix things for him, but the more I try to talk sense into his theories, the more he tries to hide from me. These beliefs are as real to them as our reality is to us. I wish my son had been given the proper diagnosis years ago so that I could have known better how to parent him"

175967009,"Hello _PERSON_..A very big welcoming hug to you, as you join the Inspire family! You have given us a well-presented picture of how you are doing, and I thank you for that. There is a lot there to digest. After reading it all, and returning to double check your age, let me suggest that you may be experiencing the beginning of menopause, which could explain the sudden onset of depression. However, that does need to be checked by your doctor, as they are able to tell from blood work. There are so many things that can go wrong, on a physical level, which very much effects our emotions. From what you have written, let me assure you that many of us have been through similar things before, and come out smiling, on the other side. You are not alone with those feelings, and you are going to find help! The endometriosis by itself could be the underlying problem. I am glad you have a doctor's appointment coming up, but in the mean time.....try to keep your mind occupied with things other than the anxiety. I a
m glad that you find walks a good diversion....that's healthy. Also, keep music playing as much as possible, read when you can, maybe even learn a new craft on utube.....anything that will keep the mind from staying stuck on how you are feeling. And one more thing....come here to Inspire as often as you can, to chat with others....that is good for you, because, with your husband at work, and you not feeling well, it is possible that you are spending too much time alone. Looking forward to seeing you soon."

175967028,"Thanks for the replies. I've done ECT before actually. It helped me get out of a severe funk (severe depression before)... I don't know. I think my psychiatrist would be unwilling to do it now though. It messed up my memory bigtime. Also the reasons I went on meds originally were: A. to curb horrendous feelings of thinking others could read my mind and that I could read theirs, B. to destroy any last inkling of depression I ever had, C. to cope with life, generally speaking, and D. to not have these ridiculous episodes where I cannot even deal with life in the slightest. Anyway, it's hard to just focus on one thing right now. I think I need a med increase, actually."

He would say, ""Did you order anything on the internet this week?"" and I would say ""Yes.. 3,4-dichloromethylphenidate"" and he'd be like ""Ok wtf.."" and phones my mom. Then I would ask him about coincidences and stuff and he would explain to me that there are no cameras in the building. My new therapist doesn't even ask me what is on my mind and what I want to talk about. She just went straight into papers and the session is like half an hour or something. I come back two weeks later and was told to read a small amount of papers instead of the whole thing so the process lasts longer."

I told them I have to see my doctor in person each month to get another refill. They say they cant do anything about it because the system they have is set to auto-fill.

I understand about not being able to talk to loved ones about problems. I have that issue. I agree with Weerbles, your last one should not have responded that way. I also have seen my therapist twice and even three times a week when I needed it. Try to find one that you can trust and respect. Keep writing as well. This is a great forum to talk about such issues. You can say something and no one knows who you are, so there will be no uncomfortable times like there are with others."

175967115,"Hey, this forum appears to have been silent for 2 years, but I hope I can find some clarification on here. I stumbled upon this while googling some of my own memory symptoms, and I think SDAM could be a possible condition I have. I am a 19 year-old in college and I cannot seem to remember my life from a personal perspective. I just feel detached mentally and emotionally from every time but the recent present. I have an average or ""normal"" memory when it comes to facts, so I can remember the names of teachers and friends in high school and middle school, but I have little to no memory of how I felt in those classes, or what it was like to be there. This feeling increases the longer ago it was. I feel no sensational memories when I think of going through middle school, I just can't feel myself placed there. Like it wasn't me, essentially. Even recently, as I am in my third semester of college, I had forgotten that during my first semester I was a pre-med student. It slipped my mind, which makes sen
se because I can't remember what it was like studying for those classes, even though it was less than a year ago. I just feel my life slipping away from me the more I live it. Has anyone else felt similar things? It is very isolating and causes a lot of identity confusion for me, because I cannot relate to my past to figure out who I am."

The second skill is theoretical thought: your post shows that you are able to synthesize two complementary truths in a wider truth, and that's very important to, for harmony, unity, and other stuff... So, I don't know what your brain scan showed, but these two skills are there, and they can be very important for you. I hope that my comment doesn't sound “prig”, sorry if it's that way.

175967127,Took the olanzepine just now - Late though. I'm trying to do everything like alleviate stress. I have everything I need online which kills the novelty out of everything. I'm on the computer constantly. I wanted to go for a walk but it started snowing and it's dark. I just can't get tf out of this hell. I work tomorrow which isn't bad - So I'll sleep early but I woke up late. I have so much to say but I feel like I'm being negative and dysphoric. It can't be like this but it is - People have to stay in their houses BILLIONS of people. Wtf. What is this. I could do anything - No time for things. I'm floating through an endless abyss and my beliefs of the circle don't help. I want it to be warmer already - Maybe have some people around. I've been isolated for most of my life.

175967194,"Hello, i'm new here and i'm 19 years old. i got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i really don't know where to start but i got out of a recent relationship, it was almost two years. this was my first serious relationship, i just wanted to express myself because i really don't have anyone to talk to. my parents don't know about this because my ex is a pre-trans. it's hard to talk about it and it hurts a lot, trying my best to not cry about it. i know some people will say that i'm crazy or how can i handle a long distance relationship but i just know how it really works. he lives far away all the way to new jersey and i'm all the way in california. his life isn't great either like mine but we did our best to cheer each other, he was the only person who i would talk about my deep feelings, trusted him deeply. i would be the one who would put up with his dumb things. i fell in love deeply again, thought he was the one. he was my everything, he helped me with my depression, anxiety, confidence and 
many more thing. i did the same to him, two months ago i felt him act all weird. he was like slowly backing away, would always ask him what's wrong. he wouldn't tell me but i knew something was wrong. would always tell him to tell me when he isn't happy, isn't happy or love me anymore. but never does, we argued and ignored on _NAME_'s, he ignored me on our one year and 9 months. i felt so hurt and mad then broke up the next day. last month he told me that he met someone else while we were still together. they talked and everything, i felt so broken and so betrayed knowing that he kept someone from me. saying that he was falling out of love, fell in love with her, that we were really never gonna be a real thing because of how far away we are. months ago i told him to wait and i would get the job and move with him. guess he didn't trust me enough. that fully destroyed me but badly. everything we build up on myself broke down. long story but short i started to fall back to depression, anxiety started to get a bi
t worse. i don't have the energy to get up or even smile. i just want to cry until i get really numb, sometimes i wished i accepted the plane ticket to be with him and not be here having suicidal thoughts. i know everyone says he doesn't deserve my tears, move on, be happy. How? How can i do that when my heart aches everyday and cry hard? did i not gave him so much support or give him all of my love? was i not good enough? i miss him. i know he is going through so much but yet i still gave him all of my attention and wasted all of my time just to see him smile instead of suffering. i feel like i don't deserve to be here.."

Personally, I suspect that COVID-19 may be the first global experiment regarding panic behavior--not the first such experiment per se, but the first for which social and economic data can be acquired and analyzed in such volume in real time and in such detail, in fact, according to as many criteria as can be used to describe a human individual. We are guinea pigs in the first global experiment capable of making individualized conclusions about every human on Earth. Capable of tweaking not even a disease, but simply news of a disease to elicit specific behavior from any demographic one cares to specify. COVID-19 is now being presented as a long-term stud
y, ""They"" say ""18 months"". Part of that study doubtless involves the question of when and whether people begin to question what they've been fed and start thinking for themselves. How independent thought arises, and what sites, specifically, were ""guilty"" of clarifying the nature of the sham. Those who think independently will be noted. Where they live will be noted. The rate at which questioning proceeds will be noted. From cell phone data, social media data, multi-factor authentication info, email content and timing data, charge card data, ISP data, the flow of thought itself is being tracked, from a global all the way to an individual scale. We have arrived at the dawn of the computerized Hell foreseen by _NAME_ in The Screwtape Letters. ""He sees you when you're sleeping.

175967208,"Yes, because they don't need the genius, and he is a pain. The culture says: ""a therefore c"" The genius says: ""what about b?"" Answer: ""b? there is no b"" or at best ""b is irrelevant"" Until b is practically relevant, it will be denied and invisible. But then again, it is how magic works. The magician sees b and know its name, and can use it to do feats of magic, while the crowd only sees what it is conditioned to see. My research team discovered this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind Not exactly the same, but would lead to a chaotic world in practice. Yes, those are possibilities. Purposeful, probably not in the realistic sense, but it is possible to retreat in one's mind and create an internal structure that is under total control, even if the world isn't. But it would be useless in that world, but then again, everything would be. That is how dancing bears are born. There is just no right or wrong dancing, it is pure potential in act. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTv4yD6BKlA Well
, just like in the video above, how many bears died because they were invisible? and what about the people that drive the car, what if it was a moose and not a bear? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr9Swatg8pY Now, what if someone had the odd belief that mooses are border crossing fanatics? they might not hit the moose, because they would expect it. That would go far for a tangent, I thought about it a lot. My brief answer is that it is because people do it out of empathy. They simply mimic each others, because doing what others do is the safe thing to do since there is strength in number. Its a major theme in the Dark Knight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ChPTKPzB4I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-gf29nuYYA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4GAQtGtd_0 The crime is to do it alone, to be odd, not the actual crime. Although in the end, it is the odd person that saves the day in the boat scene. But there is lots more you can extract from those few scenes. Also the origin of the _PERSON_ in that movie, is tha
t he used empathy, and it back fired, twice. He thought he was doing the right thing, but the persons he empathized with used it against him, so he was in some sort of double bind situations, and he creates those situations in the movie, to show people what it is like. But there is more to it. Doing what everybody does is in itself a filter, and a big one. Its the appropriate thing to do. Empathy and conformity go hand in hand, for better or worst, and it is a lot stronger than ideals, or reason, because it bypass them. Its a to c, without a b. Right, they are unconscious, it is what nice people do. Or ""civilized people"" do. Its what binds them together, which is a religious thing. Its what religion truly is, something that binds together. But if it is only empathy, then it bypass a lot of things, like reality, so it becomes superstition. So in the end it is superstition based on empathy. Right. Its best to start small on the individual level. Mass psychology is different and it is easy to loose yourself in 
it. Its the opposite. Pre-moral is raw food, before morality. Its the filter that gives a moral slant to things, although it is pseudo-moral at this point. So you take some raw food, lets say some prime rib seal buttock. You grind it and process it through the filter. You have processed food, with less nutrients. Add salts and preservatives, and you can can it. Put it in a can, put a label on it, and label the ingredients, this is the values of the food that you are trying to sell. You have to put all the ingredients for it to be legit, and make the container from recycling material. You have to analyse the prime rib in its component values, and it is moral if the content of the can is the same as what's on the label. So its a lot of work for it to be true, and it is less nutritive and natural than raw meat, but that is what people want. Morally speaking though, simply taking a bite from the live seal is just as moral and true, and is more genuinely satisfying. Blood is still warm, and it gives a fuzzy feelin
g, while canned food is dead. Primates eat dead things. They cook to try and approximate polar bear morality, but cannot ever get it right. Its warm and not rotten, but that's about it. It does not has the full enjoyment of being in symbiosis with the seal, which is the ultimate act of love. Its different. It is about preservation itself. If you can goods, you can hoard them and create a private property to hold them, and there is no end to it. Then you have to expand to hoard some more, perhaps by trading some cans for space. And you can be stolen, so you have to protect the cans. This is primate behavior, similar to squirrels without the fur. But squirrels get fat too in winter. Polar bears are only preserving what they can hold personally, so the food is personal food through and through, not for trading an competition. So there is no need for land, just water and ice. Maybe a small cache of canned food somewhere in the wild, in case a primate might come by, or some other animal. Its optional to bear natur
e, but caves can be used. Among other things, but some are hard wired as well, the eye especially, but there is a lot more. The ability to filter is probably somewhat hard wired as well, but not the specifics. Yes, but like I said, it is different, although it might look the same to some degree. It could be the predisposition is the same. But it is different. The first is natural, the other accidental. I agree with the increase in firing, but I believe more in the serotonine hypothesis, which essentially decreases the point of firing, so there is an increase in sensibility generalized. On top of that, there is the issue of decrease in neuron receptors in place like the hippocampus and some other places, which create bottle necks. It that is true, it would also mean it is linked to lower social status, perceived or otherwise. Which makes sense on an evolutionary level, since the lower status person will try to find ways to solve the problem and get peace, assuming it is getting pecked, which is automatic in pr
imates and chickens. So finding creative solutions is necessary, as well as getting rid of feelings, so what needs to be done be done. Since there is no need for communication, this also can be done away. Canned food becomes raw food, and you deal in raw, just like a polar bear that would become reckless and rampaging, which happens here and there. I don't think it is the same animal. I would consult deers perhaps, and what ancients called acedia. That's all I can really say. The desert fathers dealt with that, or how to become a camel. But yeah, I can't really tell much about it, and can't really explained how this relate to it, just possible ways. I gave some already. Teaching and conditioning is the same thing. But it is the same as a physicist looking at anomalies, while others do some other things, like fornicating. The first part is right, but it is not transferable, it is in fact taboo. b is taboo subject, you are not supposed to see it, let alone name it, which would mean you have control and power ov
er b, so that makes you a witch or a sorcerer, which is bad stuff. Primates will burn witches if they float, which happens if they have healthy fat, just like a polar bear. So you never float in front of primates, it makes them want to burn you without even eating, which is pretty pointless exercise and immoral. Here is another example. https://previews.magnoliabox.com/corbis ... 14_850.jpg That bear is walking on water, yet you are supposed not to see that, because only Jesus of some magical being walks on water, but not bears. But they do, since ice is water, so bears walk on water. Might be a strange belief for some, and it is taboo. Why? many reasons, and nobody knows why, and it is pointless to know why, because they will deny it. They will deny when you say bears walk on water, and say you are crazy. If you say it is a taboo subject, they will deny. If you explain what I just explain, they will accept bears walk on water, but will deny having denied ever, because of course they do, sort of. But the real
ity is censured, only bear on ice is allowed, which does not captivate the luminous nature of bears as it should, and their incredible power over nature. And that also is a double bind. Its abusive to bears. I am not saying all cases are this obvious or necessarily true like this one, most are in grey areas. I don't know. I think it is better in some ways, worst in some others. Some parents are simply negligent or bad, it was always the case. What's worst, is that in the past, society could compensate bad parenting, but today, with nuclear individual in humanism, that social layer is gone, so it has to be better, or it is a lot worst. They could be linked in that way. But the actual issue is still different. How you deal with it will be different. In the first it is about learning filter or how to show a personality that has one, while in the second, it is about managing stress. The second is a lot easier than the former, although the price might be high. Pretending to not see things is harder, because you do
n't know what other people don't see. Its almost an impossible task. It can only be deduced by observation and communication is of no help, on the contrary, because there will be denial. So talking is out of the question, which interferes with grooming, but then again, grooming will be stopped anyway, because of the taboos. So it is a catch 22 to try it in a normal way, which of course means it is abusive. Its another double bind, which creates what it is supposed to solve. They are separate problems that need to be addressed separately. Whether they have a similar cause or not is irrelevant. Rot. Its rot learning, which creates filters. They take too long to process the food properly, probably because of back logs. There is lots of demand from primates for dead food that can be preserved. Its even unclear what they want to do with it, they just hoard things. Bring it back to the store, that's what I do. I am not sure I understand. You mean mistrust is a monster? You want to make friends with monsters or lobo
tomize them? how does that work? Are they emotions? All I was saying is that other people's solutions, won't work if they have a filter that is different. Empathy works on filters, so you can't trust others in that way in that situation, so it compounds the differences in the long run. I think everybody has imprints, they just are different, or can be, and that creates social problems. It goes back to the start. Different cultures and so on, a sense of alienation and so on and so forth. Aliens will probe you, especially the greys. They like experiments, which are unproven, so you can't trust them. Greens are no better. When they don't understand something, they resort to abductions and bring you on their planet, and there is no bus stop, so you are at their mercy. Greys study filters, they are the experts, and they usually want them to be the same, so everything is grey, no black and white, just grey everywhere. No colors either obviously, they don't eat like polar bears and are a lot less happy to wit. That 
is how they are seen now, but they were all very important and essential in feudal society, and they were not seen as monsters, although some were seen that way sometimes, but that would be only if they stopped following God. That was the constitution of the time, and gave those people power and responsibility. Not, the constitution is Man, or human. So an individual is either human or inhuman, and that is how people can tell they are monsters. Its just the zeitgest of the time. But a feudal person that is in such a society, will search for authority, but won't see one that is divine enough, that is legitimate, so it gives a lot of resentment, and also he or she will want privilege, something humans can't do because they are equal, and they have rights, not privileges. They are more than just ideals, they are reality, a political reality. Its how people interact with each others politically. But a feudal and a humanist are on different spheres, and then there are democrats that are coming in the picture, and 
it is not clear what they look for as of yet. But the point is that feudal people today, react to democracy with censure, and so do the humanists, and that is clear on the Internet. They want it to be human, while in reality, there are polar bears and all kinds of animals in the forest, so there is repression. Feudals want something godly, which of course is even harder to do and in fact impossible the way it is made. Only network administrators can give privileges, but nobody owns the internet. At best you have sites like this, with aristocrats and such. They can give a plot of land, a thread to the good vassal. They privilege to talk and make a small post. And there is no right, only obligations. Polar bears are forced to hunt on Kings' land. A primate will go on foot. If there is many of them, they will fix the road, so carts can travel better. Same in the brain, use it or loose it type of thing, except you never really loose anything, it just gets harder to pass, and is slower, but it can be fixed when ne
eded. I talked about the hippocampus, it gets smaller in psychosis, and they it fixes itself. That is just one example. The same applies to learning, although it is probably more fixed. Habits are hard to loose, especially when you get older. Filters are the same. That is why there are generation difference, the filters are different, slightly. Not in this thread, which is what I saw. Its about liking existence itself, not improving it. Its a given, just like the dancing bear. It does not matter what the reality is. If you can't enjoy it just for there to be a reality, it will never be good enough. That there are people that are alive is a proof they care enough to do so, despite hardship, so it is to people to figure out why that is, and focus on that, and not what is only fantasies or ideals. Not that they cannot be entertained, they put life in things, but at base, it is not what sustains. Its the bear that sustains, not the dancing. Its not the random seal or beluga either, although they add up, and fat i
s good. Sure, but I was more thinking about carrion crawlers, like bugs. I am not in the vulture business myself. We have birds like that, but they can be ignored, because not good to eat. So you are dead inside, and there are creatures that want to take advantage? Yes, the Aristotelian one. Reason and social, mainly. But they are also animals, and most try to hide it, and the filters are animalistic at base. They are not properly human, it is shared with some other animals. But mostly, although self-identified with humans, a lot are still below the threshold, so primate includes them inside the human family, because they have affinities and stick together. They are like a work in progress. I am not a schemer, I let the spirit of the bear guide me. Its like an anchor, and the rest gravitates, so you try one thing and another, but I read things too. Some other people have thought about symbolism for centuries, so it is not a hazard they mesh sometimes. Water is well known. Ice is like this: https://www.youtube
.com/watch?v=PQ8bELWpUjk The thin one, not the iceberg. Yes, I am aware. I also know Datura is a shamanic plant."

He said thank you He told me a long time ago that his sister died too So I know that he can relate to loss and trauma
175967213,"Hello _NAME_! you're making the first step being here on Inspire! You are able to connect and communicate with others and vent about what's on your mind. it's not easy going through this pandemic and all the stressors that comes along with it. Joining a support group is helpful; however, there are moments that you may not have the time to logon. In times like that, I would plan more times to be out other than the grocery trips. Take a ride to another city/county in your spare time, and explore different places to go or spend time at after the pandemic has calmed down. Don't forget to take your foster day along for the ride. Keep in mind, stay safe the idea of this is remain in your vehicle your just driving and observing. Another suggestion, is to find some projects to work on around the house such as organizing your work space or other rooms. Explore other online support groups for different hobbies that may interest you."

This obviously was a lot for me to handle, and I’ve been spiraling so badly and my anxiety has never been this bad before.

There is some kind of fear I have when I look at people's eyes directly so I try to look aside. Regarding not understanding people. I have tough time at work because when people explain to me something I have trouble understanding them. I hear them, but their words do not stay. When I am given directions at work and there are several things to remember, I forget them right away. I cannot hear them but cannot focus on what they are saying. Also, often I do not hear right what people say to me so I have to re-ask once and even twice. If I still understand, it makes me feel very uncomfortable and I do not bother to ask again. I fear people get angry with me asking them constantly. So I just tell them ""Understood!"" even if I did not understand because I fear the embarrassment.

I go through periods of intense irritability and while I haven’t let it come out, I feel tempted at times to get angry with those around me.

But it feels disingenuous and that people can often see through it. I take pride in quelling these urges. What I actually do and say matters way more than what I think, and I know that it’s the depression talking. It’s still frustrating, though. Does anyone else have issues like this?

I think I might just write a blog post on romanticism and leave it at that for quite some time as I read these other interesting characters of german romanticism because that's where the soul of the movement seems to be and that is going to take some time to go over primary source material. German thought is quite unique the more I dive into it, all because they never had a renaissance. I saw an old friend at the paint store, it wasreally great to see him. Really great. My old boss retired and his daughter is running the company, which is kind of crazy. Anyway, this weekend I will write my blog post on roman

175967283,"I love those! I don't know why but they always seem like they taste better than plain cookies because of the images on them, though I know that makes no sense lol"
175967284,"I love how 95% of my newsfeed on Facebook is pictures of people’s cats and memes of cats, it’s really nice to see during all this craziness,, helps cheer me up"
175967285,My sister has a weighted blanket she's gonna give me. I think that might help with my anxiety and insomnia
175967286,"Hi, I have suffered from anxiety for ten years now, everything was fine no meds since 2 years ago, and was having a healthy lifestyle. Due to this coronavirus everything just stopped. Have to work from home, stopped going to the gym, and family members as well as co workers have been sick. I am not sure if that’s what caused for me this week to just explode. My anxiety is at peak level terrifying that I might die and worried so much. I am not sick, and taking care of myself and my daughter so much. The fear at times is just too much. I’m trying to stop social media and news since makes things worse for me."
175967287,Apparently medicaid assigned me a social worker...she's gonna call me every wednesday
175967288,The worst thing in the world is being happy and BOOM! That nauseating feeling in my stomach comes out of no where and then I go from being motivated and stuff to not wanting to do anything and not wanting to be here anymore. The worst part is that I literally have no support. Long story on why but I’m pretty much alone on this
175967289,My landlord is selling the house and is parading one after the other through here trying to get a buyer I should come down with covid too. I’m moving in a few months so I’d only need to pull the scam off until I’m gone
175967290,Gas. I get the mid-grade now instead of the least expensive. A mechanic told me it might be better to get a better quality of gas because my engine was making weird sounds.
175967291,So bf has some kind of liver problem....his enzymes are elevated....we will hopefully know more tomorrow.
175967292,Thanks SP. I hope your mom’s surgery goes well. Your family is in my prayer.
175967293,"I wanna quit school again! Also as to the psychiatrist thing -- I think most psychiatrists don't like being called on the weekends, but they should be available..."
175967294,Woo! Did a good hike. 60mg Vyvanse and 1g phenibut. Hungry now.. my mom has plates of white and dark Turkey meat and 3 pots of broth for turkey sandwiches and soup. Good for the immune system. Healthy ^-^
175967295,"Today I watched a golf tournament and it was pretty good, my favorite sports to watch are swimming, tennis, golf, track and occasionally basketball, baseball and football. So I’m happy that a sport I like to watch is on, golf. Football, I can take or leave it."
175967296,"I'm getting bored, fast."
175967297,"I want a decrease. I think it could be because of the 2.5mg THC gummy I took yesterday. I just feel like I need to be able to handle my own thoughts better and not be scared of them. I think therapy is the answer. If psychosis can be from environmental factors, it can also be treated with environmental factors. I believe that makes a lot of sense. The combination of environmental factors has to be just right to fit everyone's completely different brain chemistry. No one's brain chemistry or brain is the exact same. If it was, their universe would become one."
175967298,I bought $28 worth of Halloween candy yesterday!
175967299,"My hatred for the constant anxiety is what motivates me to take action - to do therapy, take medication, and deal with the side effects from that, start a daily meditation practice, read books about overcoming anxiety, try to practice acceptance (which is difficult), and participate in a support group. None of these things come naturally to me. But I’m willing to do anything to relieve the anxiety. And finally I seem to be making a bit of progress, though it is slow. So Angels I would say throw everything you have at this. You can feel better!"
175967300,YES Podcasts are awesome!
175967301,I’m putting my poetry (spoken word) on Spotify and Apple Music soon.

175967311,"What game are you gonna play? I'm still playing Fire Emblem. I tried the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon demo and I thought it was just ""okay."" I'm not sure if I am going to buy it. It's $60... I might as well just buy the DS version used from GameStop for $20 or something."
174357939,"So for me I did one big experiment....went off my one med completely tried all the doses etc. Once was enough, now I’m on a fixed dose of abilify. My advice if you want to play, play once....personally if you’re ok and don’t have a lot of side effects I’d stay the course."

175967319,"Yep, cut my head by accident whilst shaving"
175967320,Sleep is very good for mental health. I get 12 hours sleep a night. All 12 hours of deep dream sleep.
175967321,Are you under more stress than usual?
175967322,"_NAME_: You said you had taken many antidepressants and they ""either had adverse side effects or inefficacy (for panic disorder)?"" And ""My psychiatrist wants to try Gabapentin next because she thinks antidepressants just don’t work for me. I want to hear about other people’s experiences with different medications while having panic disorder."" As a bipolar, going in as depressed, I got dxed as depressed when I was really manic-depressed. The anti-depressant put me into mania and panic attacks. When Lithium was added, the panic attacks stopped immediately. Now my panic attacks were caused by being given an anti-depressant with no stabilizer (from being mis-dxed). They were medicine caused. Yours doesn't appear that. But I was wondering if what helped me (Lithium and my anti-depressant), which combined to stop both the depression and the panic attacks, might help you. So in the search engine, I typed in ""can lithium treat panic attacks?"" One about the 5th or 6th entry, the ""National library 
of medicine"" wrote something about that. In reduced form it said, “There is evidence that panic disorder and major depression might share some common neurobiological factors. This would be consistent with the fact that most antidepressant drugs are effective in preventing panic attacks.” The report noted a woman who had panic disorder and was also depressed. “The depressive syndrome improved rapidly with amitriptyline (150 mg/day), but the panic attacks persisted.” (Net says Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant.) They tried adding Lithium Carbonate at 600 mg a day (900 mg was too much). “Forty-eight hours later the patient showed a clinical improvement…. …. ""She remained symptom free with the maintenance of the drug combination. “To date, several reports have confirmed the beneficial effect of adding Lithium to a tricyclic antidepressant drug in resistant major depression. However, we believe that the present case report is the first one documenting the augmentation of a tricyclic ant
idepressant drug by lithium in a patient suffering from a panic disorder.” Again, you can find this by typing into the Google search engine: ""can lithium treat panic attacks?"" and it was the 5th or 6th one from the top (National library of medicine). You might want to print out the full report and show it to your psychiatrist. It's only about 20 sentences long. Again, as a bipolar, I take 600 mg of Lithium a day and 7.5 mg. of Mirtazapine anti-depressant and have done well on that for decades."
175967323,"Psychosis and meds decreased my cognitive but it made me more empathetic and gave me some kind of wisdom that I think, knowing myself, wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise. I used to be a reckless careless logical person and I don’t like that kind of person. Not anymore."
175967324,For my daily self care I take my meds and brush my teeth. Donut with Schiz. !

175967328,I’m so tired. I hope I can get a nap in before fiancé comes home. He said he doesn’t like me sleeping during the day. I’ve tried so hard to stay awake but I can’t.
175967330,"If I don't eat some protein before I go to bed, I wake up early in the morning feeling very anxious. It's at that time my blood sugar is low. Low blood sugar and anxiety feel the same. It could be many things, IDK, but you could try eating some protein at bed time and see if that works for you."
175967331,"Sometimes I need sugar for motivation, it kicks up the dopamine just enough...."
175967332,That makes a lot of sense lol
175967333,This is kind of weird but I like bananas mashed up with peanut butter and honey. It’s so good. I’ve never had banana bread pudding but that sounds really good
175967334,Went to pick up samples of meds from my pdoc and he invited me in for an impromptu appt! And he might give me metformin! He said he will contact me at the end of the day or week. Idk what that nurse said but she might’ve not even asked him!

Well I said, ""i highly doubt that she said that and was probably out of context""... he yelled ""******** I heard it on tv""... forgot what I said but I raised my voice... he said ""don't yell at me I'm you're father""... I got mad told him to go **** himself and walked in the middle of traffic to walk home because he was no father of mine. Tweaky tweaks again.

175967348,I agree with you. I like Mental Health better. I behave quite fine thank you very much! Welcome to Roll Call! Hope you'll join us a lot.
175967349,"_NAME_, It's good that you reached out for help. This is a good website, you don't even have to leave your house to get some assistance from people who have bipolar. You said you're beginning to think about bipolar. Have you looked at the symptoms and believe you might have that? Have you been to a psychiatrist who may believe you have that?"
175967350,So I need help. I need help turning my writing into a business. Not advice on how to be profitable but advice on how to actually establish it as a recognized business.
175967351,You!!!!!!!
175967352,I relate so much to not being able to reach out. I struggle with that as well. I think part of it is because sometimes I have in the past and the people I reached out to didnt seem to care. I also try to block out feeling anything. You’re situation at work sounds very tough and maybe by continuing to show your skills they will listen. I’m no professional just wanted to say I understand and you do matter.
175967353,I was thinking of doing a coursera course but the Vyvanse wore off. I've been lying in bed and yawning tears are coming from my eyes cuz I'm yawning so much.. My moms friend said she might want to go to dinner in 3 hours but that's the time that I want to be in bed.
175967354,You are brilliant!!!! Yes!!
175967355,Not happy with myself right now.

175967363,"I started talking to fiance again about starting to plan a wedding for this time next year. Would love to have a fall wedding. It's my favorite season. Not sure if it's the right time tho. I just mentioned it to him. I started thinking about it today. Everyone at work who notices my ring asks when the wedding is. I havent been thinking about it. And fiance has been going through very rough times at work. Dealing with people who arent working, so hes taking up their slack plus his own. And they have been making him work one of his off days. Hes ready to quit."

175967365,That’s great!
175967366,I ate 3 yes THREE servings of salad. Almost everything was from my garden so it tasted awesome. This is the 2nd night in row I’ve eaten eaten like a literal cow. I really want junk food though. So so bad. But I’m being good...as a whole my family needs to eat better. I’m the shopper and the cook...I model the behavior sooo gotta stop eating like a toddler left alone in a candy store. Ugh. I love junk. Confession...so desperately needed chocolate last night I ate cocoa mix from the package...in bed so no one knew I didn’t even log into work today. Fail. I’m still feeling weird today. Like just out of touch. Not really related to mental illness just like life kicking the **** out of me. Oh well...this too shall pass.

175967370,It was high blood pressure that was wrong with me. But I'm sorting it out. My psychiatrist gave me ativan to lower it. My mom said to taper down on the phenibut and then everything will be ok... I'll take a seroquel and an ativan tonight then take 1g phenibut tomorrow. I wanted to go to the hospital but my sister calmed me down and then I slept for 5 hours. I plan on going to bed at midnight. I talked with my psychiatrist and it wasn't a pleasant feeling at all. My blood pressure was high so I was kind of panicking. She said that antipsychotics are good for me and that psychedelics are like a forest fire of neurons and that psychosis makes people lower their IQ - Not the meds.
175967371,"I just posted a few days ago... I started 5mg Lexapro Thursday at dinner time, and felt ok all evening. Friday, I woke up with high anxiety and was terribly nauseated all day. I took an half tablet that night, and Saturday was a little better. Saturday I took another half tablet, and today, Sunday, I am nauseated again. I am literally afraid to eat and this is a problem because I’m underweight. I’m also having panic attacks about once an hour. Both days that I felt worse, I had taken a Xanax early in the morning. I’m at wits end."
175967372,Has anyone heard from Erti lately?

175967376,"Hello! I made this account a few years back but never used it so I decided to give it a try again. I’m a 26 year old female whose main diagnosis’s are bipolar 1, PTSD and Generalized anxiety disorder. I have a hard time telling people about my bipolar disorder. Telling people about my PTSD or anxiety is fine but I feel like bipolar is so stigmatized. I constantly feel like I’m living a double life or something. I know bipolar doesn’t define me but it’s part of who I am and I hate that I can’t just be open about it. I need to know that I’m not alone and other people feel the same way about their bipolar diagnosis."
175967377,I think I'm going to stop the metformin. I don't think it's making much of a difference and also the pills are so big every time I swallow them I panic and think I'll choke
175967378,Thank you!
175967379,"Hey, I don't personally hear voices but I have had problems with believing that people were out to get me and also that people could read my mind. Some of my delusions were in line with what you're talking about. I hope you can get some relief. Have you seen a psychiatrist or therapist about this? A psychiatrist is honestly the most likely to help you with this problem."
175967380,"I'm being bombarded by Intrusive thoughts again. These thoughts usually involve 'what ifs' scenarios and the consequences. The 'what ifs' thoughts are so bizarre that I'm embarrassed to tell anyone. It sucks all my energy when I get these thoughts because I'm usually ruminating on it although I try not to. My therapist told me to argue with these thoughts when I get them; it works sometimes, but it is also exhausting. To top it off, I feel that if I do or don't do something, then something bad will happen to me. I was never diagnosed with OCD, but I wonder if I have it due to my ritualistic behavior or thoughts. I'm interested in learning how others cope when they get these thoughts."
175967381,"I was extra zoned out yesterday as I stopped off for petrol at the petrol station. In a daze I pulled up beside the pump and got out to fill the tank. There was no fuel tank on that side of the car so I drove around the gas station ( did a u-turn ) so i could approach the pump from the other side of the car. Got out again to fill the tank. No tank on that side either had to do another u-turn to align myself on the other side, still no fuel tank. Very embarrassing as there were some workmen parked nearby in a truck. I snapped out of my reverie and had to focus really hard and think.. the fuel tank is on the passenger side. I know this .. I have done it 1000's of times and f'uck it I was parked beside the pump yet again on the driver side. Had to another u-turn before getting it right. really not sure what happened there. I think, for no reason, I imagined the fuel tank to be somewhere it has never been. The men were in stitches laughing while pretending not to see anything."

That really killed my inspiration. Idk if I even can focus on video games. I try to better myself but sometimes I just have to learn to let go.. although I feel better when I'm productive..

175967392,"getting by said... Sounds like she needs an antidepressant that she would take daily. Talk to her doc about it. If you can... I have a bad temper and my antidepressants help keep it in check. I wish you the best. A lot can happen in a split second of a temper tantrum. Hugs, _NAME_... Thank you. I don't know too much about the medication that she takes and I'm not sure if her doctor will talk to me about it and my wife's response to all of this is that she can't control her temper and therefore, I shouldn't expect her to control her temper because she just can't. She compares it to expecting a blind person to take good photographs. They just can't do it and it is unreasonable to expect them to do so. In like fashion, she says that she just can't control her temper and it is unreasonable to expect her to do so. And yes, I know first hand how quickly she can fly into a rage. Thank you again.

175967393,"I've had anxiety attacks and they are a horror. You can always go to the emergency room and they will give you some tranquilizers to calm you down, and hopefully enough for the next few days. They will take care of you. I went to the ER recently with severe chest pain, and they really took care of me. If you're able to now, can you make an appointment with a psychiatrist? As for which one, you can look on the internet search engine under ""psychiatrist for your home town."" You can choose a male of a female, perhaps one near you. You can also look under ""mental health centers for your hometown."" They will have a sliding scale, where you only pay what you can afford. Are you able to do that? Do you believe that you can do this?"

175967404,I dismissed derealization and depersonalization (Dissociation) because how can I have like every mental disorder? That's ridiculous. But labels help to explain things in a way. I got the dissociation from my bad psychedelic trip. The ketamine provided a relaxing and euphoric dissociation from my depression (To LOOK AT my thoughts rather than BE my thoughts) which was what I needed. The last dose gave me a dissociative panic attack and then the dissociation was cured.

175967412,_USER_ID_ might help
175967413,I'm taking the geodon instead of the haldol tonight.
175967414,"_PERSON_ it’s definitely hard sometimes. I have some ideas of why it’s impacting me so much and despite knowing, it’s still painful. Its crazy how sometimes I feel like I know what to do and actually do it. And other days am paralyzed and can’t do anything! So confusing..."
175967415,"Im a bit torn with this one. On the one hand I've always found it easier to survive on my own and that was my first instinct answer plus I really don't hold much trust in people but then on the other hand I like people to have a laugh with...people who I don't expect anything from me on an emotional level. If I was to survive as part of a group then I'm afraid I would have to coordinate things and there would need to be a plan of action. As long as everyone knows what they are doing then that would be the only part I'd play in it. If people aren't cooperative then I'm afraid I would have to walk away and leave everyone to die and I'd go it alone. That's a fair compromise, no?"
175967416,Every1 must be watching the news i suppose Possible trigger:
175967417,"Yes, I showered and washed my hair."
175967418,"I don’t think my identity is fixed, but changing over time. I think this is a good read: Psychology Today Who Am I? A far better question to ask yourself, ""How would I like to experience my life."""
175967419,"Yeah I'm just so frustrated with this whole thing. Sleep-wake.., life, independence, mental illness, treatment, meds, doing things, etc.. I've heard of old people in homes taking a shot of wine to help them sleep. Since nothing bad happened then I took 2 benzos last night with zopiclone and phenibut, it will be ok to take with just zopiclone alone. Eventually my tolerance will be gone and the zopiclone alone will help me sleep. It's just cuz I messed up by taking that extra vyvanse, staying up all night and then taking alprazolam to sleep. My mom drinks a bottle of wine a night with her lorazepam."
175967420,"I see. My gag reflex is super strong, I’d probably puke rather than choke. I would talk to the T specifically about those thoughts and why they may or may not be realistic? Definitely ask the pharmacist about th pill crusher. I’ve never used one. I used to take pills by chewing up 2-3 m and ms and putting the pill into the mix and swallowing."
174358063,Does anybody here have any experience with taking CBD oil as a way to treat Schizophrenia? I was diagnosed about 4 years ago and have been taking Seroquel for almost 3 years now and it has worked wonders for my mental state but has made me gain 90 pounds and has sent my cholesterol levels through the roof. It would be nice to find a more natural alternative that doesn't have so many physical side effects. I've been doing a lot of research on CBD oil and it sounds promising but I wanted to ask fellow schizophrenics if it has worked for them. Thanks.
175967421,Just got home. Off tomorrow. MRI and counseling tomorrow.
175967422,I can’t tell if they are actually swollen tho or not. They might be. Or maybe not. Btw don’t take a Benadryl and drink alcohol. I’m just saying to y’all for future information... Anyway
175967423,No I'm afraid to cause I'll freak myself out even more. I woke up with really bad nausea today now the dizziness
175967424,Imagine.. The virus triggers a gene in parts of the brain like some Europeans.. A sense of uncomfort in the same area.. A craving to travel..
175967425,I'm a little stressed. Maybe a little sad too. I will try to relax for a while and then go to bed. It's getting late.
175967426,"I wondered if it could be that, it’s possible."
175967427,"they really don't know what to do about me, they can't even agree on any diagnosis consistently (other than NPD and ASPD, but even non professionals know this so they're not exactly telling me anything i don't already know. PAH!) i'm getting evaluated for ECT though because regardless of what you call my problems i'm pretty ****_NAME_ up right now tbh.;"
175967428,"I feel like never coming off of olanzapine, Abilify, and the other meds I'm on. I sometimes feel bad for having to take so many meds, but the alternative is far worse. I was able to work today. I actually worked for an hour. Tomorrow I have three hours scheduled."
175967429,"Good question, but we do have CO detectors and my family is fine. It does affect me outside as well."
175967430,Have you been drinking enough fluids? Sometimes dehydration can cause a headache. HUGS hope you feel better soon
175967431,Finally started drawing again. _NAME_ a charmander but I plan on coloring it in the scheme of Mega Charizard X
175967432,No. Sorry guys. I don’t mean for it to come off as that. My fiancé is a good guy. He’s just concerned cuz I have hypochondria and take all kinds of pills all day out of fear I am dying with something.
175967433,I'm so agitated tonight
175967434,Physical or mental?
175967435,"I always enjoy your posts, newtus!!!!!!!!1"
175967436,"Cabin fever.. It's like my mind is so used to being in the same state that I want to escape from it.. I was basically locked in a basement for a few years. I had nowhere to go, nothing to do, no place to be.. My mom neglected me for her bf.. Now I'm almost 23 and can't escape into the real world.. I'm stuck in my room again. Would anyone blame me for wanting to constantly escape? Meditation, cigarettes, drugs.. I have no guidance from anyone. All they say is ""You're young. Everyone that is young feels like they don't know what to do about their future"". That doesn't help. I need a list of things because all I do constantly is talk to myself. All I have is my thoughts. Yknow why they say people that talk to themselves are crazy? Because when you talk to yourself constantly, you're just thinking in your own internal symbols, losing touch with reality. So many people lose touch with reality. Meditation helps bring you back. Meditation is not thinking and just listening to just completely be aware to 
realize that there is no such thing as the future. No past. Time is now. The winter was hard. Short days. Long nights. I'm happy that the sun is rising. I do feel alone most of the time. It's good to feel alone because that means that I'm not schizoid. Those people create their own realities. Reality is juicing an orange. It is cutting someone off in a car. But what's the point of even typing my thoughts down? They don't mean anything. I constantly think like this every waking moment. I have forever trip. Hallucinatory Persisting Perception Disorder. I see my therapist today in the afternoon. I don't even know what to say. Because there's so many things that I can say and so many things that I can't because I don't know how."
175967437,"Headache today. PMS I think. I kind of want a glass of wine but after the other night I’m not so sure. Idk though. There were other factors playing into that as well though such as too much caffeine and withdrawing from thorazine, drinking 2 glasses instead of 1 and on an empty stomach."
175967438,Lying in bed listening to music. My sister asked if I want take out food and I said bring me two cokes. I'm on my phone cuz too lazy to get up to go on computer 2ft away.
175967439,It was difficult. She was concerned but she seemed comfortable waiting til Wednesday. I had to promise to go earlier if I need to tho.
174358076,Lol I thought if my white blood cell count decreases that’s when they stop giving the clozapine but for some reason it was really high which they said was urgent. Said I still get my meds but I needed to see my doctor. I’m sure it’s a uti but I’m also hacking and gagging and ran a low grade fever couple days ago. Doctor google didn’t say nice things about blood count.
175967440,Lithium is a mood stabiliser and used in the psych world for mostly bi polar. Lexapro is very useful for anxiety woth associated depression. Since you went off and not weaned and got back even on the lower dose ya brain is going to get cranky. From what you say it was the increase and not necessarily the medication....correct me if wrong. I reckon four days is too quick to give up...got to get firing again happening. I am not a dr...just thinking from experience only. And if you were stable before the increase? What is your dx...if you feel comfortable in sharing. Lexapro alike others aint for everyone...all trial n error. Lexapro is top shelf... But hit n miss and can have some terrible side effects....esp early on. Brain zaps!!! Lithium is hit n miss. Got to keep a regular eye on ya liver. Liver function tests. Just blood test...it can be problematic for the liver. I hope ya doc is a psychiatrist....if not it is a must...they know how to dx and correctly treat. Regards. HT
175967441,My sister said she’ll come over sometime and we can make the bread together.

175967443,I feel so calm. Vyvanse is a tranquilizer.
175967444,"I took Rx & supplements, including fish oil."
175967445,I look so awful I can't believe my friend stays with me. I wish I could go home. I want to watch Star Trek marathons everyday and order pizzas and burgers and fries and giant grinders. That would be heavenly. So stupid of me to have gotten into this mess.
175967446,I’m afraid I’m gonna die cuz I took the burner off the stove to clean it. Idk if it’s gas or electric. My hands smell funny. Are we gonna die?
175967447,Did 50 squats and some arm exercises
175967448,"Good you checked out all those conditions. I often am dizzy first thing when I wake up, but Doc told me that's mainly due to my low blood pressure. Maybe someone else can help out here on this site."
175967449,"_PERSON_ you've got me inspired. I'm looking at different décor ideas for my apartment. I still need to get curtains, with tension rods. Probably gonna get red. Then I'm gonna get these seat covers for my love seat and armchair. My loveseat and armchair are vinyl (they're still comfortable, but I'd like them to have a soft surface) so I'm getting those seat cover things H.VERSAILTEX 2-Piece Jacquard Spandex Loveseat Stretch Slipcover, Charcoal Gray - Walmart.com - Walmart.com some throw pillows, a throw blanket. Then some wall décor for behind my couch. I have other wall decor but that wall is bare and needs something. Need a small coffee table, a white board for my bedroom wall, some door décor for my apartment door. This is gonna take several months to do. But my sister is gonna help me. I want this place to be my little sanctuary."
175967450,Pancakes for dinner.....
175967451,"Cuz I know I said that I like ""Being"" my thoughts but sometimes I just need to ""Look at"" them and observe... Instead of being in shackles and chains. I wonder if it helps with OCD. I'll research that now and report back. I'm lucky that all of my meds are paid for btw. It's like 1500 dollars a month for my meds. Like holy crap. I blame Big Pharma."

175967453,"I ordered 5 proofs. Some to give to my family. Mom, dad, sister."
175967454,"My sister just called me. She said she thinks she had a panic attack last night. She said she was just eating dinner and out of nowhere she felt like she had been drugged and felt her body completely relax and she felt outside her body. And then she said she felt like she was going crazy. She said the more she tried to calm herself down the crazier she felt. I told her it was probably a panic attack. She said when her husband was talking to her, his words seemed ""blurry""."
175967455,What have u been up to lately?
175967456,Maybe the microdose mushrooms will help next week. I really shouldn't be doing this since I'm on an antipsychotic.. But I'm really really burnt out.
175967457,"Well, I guess, thanks. My friend is here, going back tomorrow. The vape store guy says they can't get refills for my Juul knock off so I asked my friend, while he was here if he'd get me a Juul. They're overpriced but in stock. I'm sorry the one I had has no future in the US. So, today he got me 8 disposables and my God they're going to be a mess in my locked drawer. I keep wanting to get away from the disposables because they're not really eco friendly. So who knows. Then, I won't see him for 2 or 3 weeks or longer. I'm very scared about that."
175967458,It's been a whole week since I last had a panic attack!!
175967459,Oops.
175967460,"Took a shower Brushed my teeth Took a walk Bought myself a new journal and some new pens, retail therapy Listening to music Having a few cups of coffee Put on perfume, _PERSON_ by _NAME_"
175967461,"That sounds delish, _PERSON_. It's supposed to be in the 20s today but it felt warmer than that out. I accidentally flooded my tank which sucks. The little disposables I like are illegal now I guess. Unless they tasted like tobacco juice. I guess they will discontinue carrying them."
175967462,"Yeah it was really nice of them, I'm doing okay, a little calmer than yesterday How are you?"
175967463,So far for me I'm not getting as much side effects on it vs other anti psychotics. the blood work they have you do every week for 6 months is to check on something that's rare for the med to do. I'm ok with needles so I've been able to go to each week.
175967464,Thank you so much for your response. I was taking Lexapro for 10 years at 10 mg and that is what they started me at now. It was working great for all those years but I don’t remember how long it took to kick in. I think last night was my best night of sleep where I wasn’t having all the crazy negative thoughts in my head. It’s been about two weeks now and I still have many bouts of hating my life and feeling like it’s over at my age. I really hope there’s others out there going through what I’m going through. Although I don’t want others to have to experience this I think we all need company. Can anyone share if they have had similar experiences/thoughts? Thanks All
175967465,The caffeine crash made me really tired yesterday. I'm trying to improve my cognition but I have no motivation rn.. Might as well take 10mg of Dexedrine IR early and see if that helps. A friend that I don't know very well keeps asking me for money like 30-60 dollars a month and then pays me back - And it's been a cycle of this for like a year. I'm ignoring his messages now. I find it mentally draining. I need more social interaction and such - It's good for mental health. I'm sitting here in quarantine. My test came back negative btw. I want to exercise too - I hiked a lot and mountain biked in 2019 but the people I was with are dysfunctional and self destructive so I don't talk to them anymore.
175967466,"Hey everyone, Got a new translation of my favorite book. It's not new, its from like 1930, the translation not the book. This woman did an excellent job translating it. My own quibble is that she didnt' translate the 2nd part. So, now im left with half a story. That was a big let down when I opened it up and discovered that. Still, the book is worth over $200 and I only paid $23 bucks for it."
175967467,"thanks but none around me, I have to walk and the pharmacy I go to is only a ten minute walk down the street so it's not that big a problem"
175967468,_PERSON_ I think it is. I also deal with acid reflux so that doesn’t help.
175967469,"_PERSON_ I probably should just go in person. But I need someone to help me like, guide me, to eating better. I cant rely on my mom or sister anymore to teach me, because my mom just tells me to not eat a lot, and my sis says ""just eat whole foods like vegetables"", even tho they are super skinny and eat well and work out. I need a deeper understanding of how to eat better. But I cant pay for a nutritionist or anything because my Medicare only covers those services if ur already diabetic, and I dont want to wait til I'm diabetic to start eating better."
175967470,Grocery stores are over whelming
175967471,"Yeah I think I’m in a good place right now. I have happiness, sadness, and worries but somehow they don’t control me, don’t stop me from living. To me this is one of the best posts you make so far. Full with insight about yourself and I really like the last paragraph"
175967472,"Hi, I'm Rich aka Older Guy, I am really gobsmacked (British word) by the amount of anxiety i'm having from changing my routine today. I would normally go out and do my errands in the morning. Today I will do them in the afternoon. I would usually use an affirmation of ""I've done this before and I know I can do it again"". In this case, it hardly applies, as it's been many months or even years since I've changed up my routine"". Perhaps I will use ""when i've done this, i will be glad"". Feedback encouraged."
175967473,Oh yay!!!
175967474,"It may be part of the idolization and devaluing others that people with BPD often do. Accepting that he could be as good as he seems, means taking a risk with your heart and accepting the possibility of rejection in the future. The feeling of opening up to another person and then possibly being abandoned is at the core of BPD . It can seem easier to find things you dislike and to drive the person away or discard them than to possibly be abandoned yourself. I would talk with a therapist who is trained in dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) who can help you to develop skills to deal with the discomfort you feel. Best of luck. I hope everything works out well for you."
175967475,Donuts for Donut Friday and some _NAME_ In The Box for Lunch. (Not a healthy eating day today)
175967476,Did you ever have the chest pains?
175967477,Thank you! _USER_ID_: just ordered it.
175967478,"Yeah, it's for sure possible. I think it's likely that I do better with my old pdoc. You're not overstepping, haha. It's actually really helpful to hear things like that because sometimes I get the sense that others want me to do a certain thing and I resist it a lot. But you're right, sometimes my decision-making process is just fried, so I need others to tell me what to do."
175967479,"Yes definitely, I invited my sister over tomorrow for coffee and cheesecake, it will be nice"
175967480,me too. Took my meds and one of two of my supplements.

175967483,"I had fast food for dinner. I wish I had more will to cook, but I do not. Tomorrow I have to work alone, which I dislike. I like working in at least pairs. Packing up all the equipment from a house into the vans always takes a lot of time, then I have to vacuum and sweep everything. the of that really takes extra time. Watching the black list lately. On season 7. It's a great show, it's the longest running show with a solid story all the way through so or. My emotions are everywhere, I'm still trying to figure out what exactly is happening. I see my therapist in a few days, so I'll have to prepare for that and maybe write everything down to get down to brass tacts (tax)? My life is pathetic. I wish meds would take away my paranoia that is actually justified. But then again, I'd be putting others at risk for some sick people who get off on watching me suffer and yell out into the void."
174358127,Doing fine today. Just did some translation and some other things. Drank a really strong coffee.
175967484,"Hi! Thank you for reaching out - a lot of courage is involved in doing so. You deserve to feel validated, yet all too often, those closest to you don't understand what it feels like, and think it's 'just being sad' etc. This must be really tough for you! Your parents have no reason to dislike you for how you are. And there is a difference between FEELING anxious (an upcoming exam, a big event planning, etc.) and anxiety controlling every day. I'm not necessarily saying your mom is wrong - she probably does have anxiety as well. But your anxiety is a lot more frequent, which makes a big difference. It must be hard to feel so alone with these feelings, I've felt the same all too often. Any time I say anything about my depression, how anxious I am, how I hate myself, etc, my family just doesn't get it. They think i'm just sad, and give me hurtful advise like 'get over it' or 'its just life', etc. At one point, my anxiety was so bad that I had to leave church multiple times because the SAME people I've 
always seen was too much for me. You deserve to feel validated about how you feel, because it's real - even if noone else around understands. Nothing is 'wrong' with you, everyone is different from one another, and all have struggles that vary person to person. I would try doing things to calm your anxiety (that don't conflict with your parents), and maybe also paying attention to who/what/where/why your anxiety flares up... and try to avoid certain circumstances that makes your anxiety worse. I'd recommend things like meditation - I really like the Calm app, listening to calming instrumental music, taking a bath with a bath bomb, getting outside and enjoying nature, getting a few steps in, etc. Sorry for the long epistle :D hope this helps, keep fighting - you've got this!"

175967488,"My moms lovers have controlled my life since I was 12. And I fell for all of their ********. Now my mom goes up to me and says ""Later we need to have a talk about what you're going to do with your life"" as if that's what I haven't been telling her for a good while now. I bet it was her new bf that wants me to move out that was talking to her. She showed no interest in my life and never pushed me at all to even go to school and now she wants to kick me out. I would prefer to move out and live beside the psych hospital where rent is 500 a month or move into my apartment and work part time. Then I'll be free.

175967506,"*I am not a doctor*, but have done years of research for the same exact scenario as I have been on and off a few meds and they can be brutal to come off of. I followed a precise weening schedule my doctor gave me for a couple meds I tried. Most recently, I am proud to say that I successfully got off of Lexapro. It was not a cake walk, to say the least. My first week was MISERABLE. Vertigo, nausea, headaches, mood swings, brain ""buzzing"" sensations and feeling like my body was being shocked. I was DETERMINED not to say ""forget it"" and go back on the Lexapro. I decided to fight back. I came across a mental health blog post and it mentioned a mixture of a Magnesium supplement, b vitamin supplement, and a fish oil supplement. I of course consulted my doctor and he said give it a go. Honestly after 2 days I had energy again, I was not nauseous and the shocking feeling was very distant and minimal. I stayed SUPER, like CRAZY, hydrated to let my body do it's thing and filter the meds out. Also...sound
s crazy, but my mom was also researching for me and she got me a body brush (like you would bathe with) and directed me to ""dry brush"" my skin is circular motions before bed. Long story short, doing that is said to give your lymphatic system (lymphnodes) a boost and circulate more of the meds out of you system! I stayed super active and leaned on my amazing husband for his support and got thru it all! It has been 3 months and I feel great...this is coming from somone who NEVER thought it would be possible to fully end my love/hate relationship with anxiety/depression meds! You CAN do it!! Stay strong and stay DETERMINED!"

175967511,"Your other responders above have good insights, and one or both may ""speak to"" you in terms of their experiences. I don't have agoraphobia, although came close at some points, but have had anxiety most of my life. My situation is not similar to yours but I see possible reasons for an anxiety disorder for you, being you are either separated or divorced, and either way are a single parent. I don't know if being adopted causes anxiety as an adult, but since you mentioned your upbringing. My idea is if therapy alone isn't resolving things for you, seek support groups in addition to therapy. If you click on the MHA icon above, then go to the bottom of their page, under Resources, Support Groups, there is a long list of kinds of support groups nationwide. Maybe not for exactly what you are seeking, but probably something that would ""speak"" to you. If your geographical area is really devoid of support groups in person, many of the national support groups have telephone and/or online options. Wishing y
ou the best."

I want to do something for the world, be an entrepreneur, find and do what I love for just enough to survive or get a good education and do research. I want to travel and learn as much as I can.

Because it's close to that now.. What will I do if I'm not myself? Not able to learn or even as fast as anyone else.. It's becoming that.. I

I do feel very anxious because of what is happening to me health wise. The biggest cause of my anxiety is my father in law honestly. Having him intrude on both myself and my wife non stop is really quite upsetting. My wife refuses to set boundaries for her father as she is afraid to upset him. He is a very forceful individual who is alone all the time because he alienates everyone around him. I am just now looking into therapy to help me get through all this. I think if it were just one thing I could handle it better. Having cancer, spine pain with more surgeries on the horizon and now a father in law who practically lives with us is just to much at once.

I have schizoaffective. I can function from day to day and without stress. My family people are competitive and active. They seem incapable of seeing that I am a different person now. More or less, I am trying to remain cordial and honoring of my relatives. I keep getting to my perception that they just aren't going to respond in a way that I want them to do. If I let my emotions get away from me, I feel negative about my relationships, too. Thankfully a good number of difficult problems are solved for me as to getting by in a city. I gained a lot of solace from trying to be of service in the community center. I think that I can survive with out my bio family sometimes.

175967594,"There was a brief time in college but it didn't stick. A anomaly in my life as a whole. There was a lot going on at the time so it's hard to point a single finger at a cause. It was more like pre-psychosis. An overactive imagination that controlled me. Stopped wanting to touch things in public, didn't want to drink the water, had an imaginary friend, was downright terrified of visualizing ghosts, lost a lot of weight rapidly, had a very restrictive diet, was alone nearly all the time, felt things. The air around me was charged, and my senses were running wild. I can still feel the memory. Sense it brush against my mind in a shudder. The only way I'll get back into that state is kicking and screaming. When the murmurs come, whispered thoughts about coincidences and spirits...I push it away. There's a risk in entertaining possibilities. I can feel it trembling beneath the surface like a cup too full of water. A rich imagination that could drown me."

It asks you how you feel before and after the visuals, which are kaleidoscopic type visuals, plus interactions where you use your head as the pointer/lead in the visuals instead of your controllers. It’s a meditative app. Before I rated myself 5 out of 10 with 10 being I feel excellent. After, i rated myself an 8. So it said I have a 30 percent increase in my mood."

175967600,"_PERSON_ I'm sorry that you've been struggling with not only your disease but also learning to trust again. Youre not alone! I've struggling with almost the same thing for around 15 years. I dont know how to rebuild friendships or establish new ones bc I've had major depression, migraines and anxiety for almost 20 years. I dont even know how to make friends anymore and I tend to come across offputting and most ppl I meet dont like me and I dont know what I'm doing wrong, I'm just out of practice from isolating so long. It's not just being able to make friends again, but deep down I think I kind of resent the friends that slowly disappeared over the years. Not the friends I was less close with and we obviously drifted apart bc I didnt go out anymore. But I find myself resenting the ppl I considered my best friends. The ones I told everything to, but when it came to telling them about my depression, there was no response other than 1 friend that asked why I was starting meds even after I told her my 
problems. She scrunched up her nose in disapproval and that was that. I've heard by many that I could get over it if I tried, it was all in my head, I was just lazy, etc. But never a ""how are u feeling, how was today, did your meds work?"" The thing is ppl dont respond to depression like they would any other disease that has some sort of test or proof that you really have the disease and the symptoms are real, so your more likely to get sympathy and understanding. Mostly I HATED when I experienced any emotion even if i got angry over something most would get angry about too, my friends would weird out on me and keep a distance just watching and thinking that I'm crazy or have issues. My bf from high school went to college together and lived together sophmore year (when I had my first major depressive episode and spiraled down from there) and 4 months later she told me she was moving in with someone else. After that we rarely if ever talked. My other roommate who I supported thru many major issues stopped tal
king to me when I decided to move in with my brother to save money. And my dorm suite mate and I always confided in each other but she got in a sorority so we still talked but not as often. A few years ago I saw that they had all been bridesmaids at each others weddings and I wasnt even invited. And I was closer to the two other roommates than my bc from high school and they still didnt invite me. It's hard to decide if I lost all friends bc I started isolating and not going out bc I was depressed. If me being depressed and negative about life made me unbearable to be around (bC I admit spending time with the mentally I'll isn't much fun so who would want to) or if my closest friends either didnt know how to deal with me or if they really weren't great friends who even checked up on me now and then. My trust in making new friends is completely gone. Instead of having a good time I wonder what kind of impression I'm making, trying to stay positive and cheerful and not do anything that makes them not like me. A
nd I'm a complete failure at it! Will it ever get better? I have NO friends now and I really dont know where to find new ones. I'm 38 and most are married with kids. I dont go to the gym and I dont know where to meet ppl and how to actually start a relationship I'm here for you if you want to talk or vent! We can practice our friendship skills together! I also rarely answer the phone or check emails, but you said you were the same so we dont need to feel obligated to respond to each other within a set time frame. So if you're interested, just contact me whenever. Even if you just need a few words of support. Thanks so much for you're post!"

175967605,"We got a heavy rain and the second floor of my house was leaking everywhere. My sister’s air conditioner broke down, probably because of that. It couldn’t be turned off so she woke up my mom panicking that it would blow. It pissed my mom off somehow and she impulsively called some people to get it checked. She met them without wearing a mask. Those people came into our house, also not wearing a mask. We turned off the electricity and it turned off the air conditioner. We probably have Covid viruses everywhere in the house now. My anxiety is sky rocketing and I feel drowsy and nauseous. Now my mom and sister are arguing with each other. I’m in my room trembling."
175967606,"Hello! I’m just now navigating this scary world of an unstable mother. I’m 32 years old and a mother myself. My own mom has always had ups and downs and has been especially moody growing up and into our adulthood. Our family knows how to walk on eggshells very well. Just recently, due to covid and my mom losing her job, her mental health completely deteriorated - sending her into a deep despair. She became detached and highly suicidal. We’ve never seen her like that and were very scared. We made the hard decision to hospitalize her against her will as we were so afraid she was going to take her life. Unfortunately, her treatment ended much too soon and she didn’t really get anything out of it except an increase in her Effexor dosage. She has been out for a little over a week and is in a pretty extreme mania. She doesn’t sleep, is convinced she needs to publish a book, and has organized every crevice of my parents house. I feel at such a loss as to how to get my mom back. To make matters w
orse, her cobra insurance expires on July 1st due to her losing her job because of covid and she has yet to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist. My family is terrified and don’t have any clue how to navigate this world we have found ourselves in. Can anyone relate?"

175967610,Has anyone heard from _PERSON_? It’s been awhile since I’ve seen her around. I know she usually doesn’t come on during weekends but I don’t remember seeing her here last week. Just wondering if she’s okay.
175967611,Classical
175967612,"Thanks DT, I'll definitely check that out sometime!"
175967613,"Back from T. We were working on how to not get back in my thoughts when I'm alone, and how to remember to take my meds, cuz I rarely forget them, but past month been forgetting them like many many times. Like 2x a week now or 1x a week. Its normally like 1 or 2x a month, if any. She said to place them somewhere I go every morning and to even wear a bracelet if I need to to remind me to take it. And some other things. We have 2 more sessions. Shes approving me for 15 more through the workforce program. And then itll be like 70 dollars per session after that I guess."
175967614,That's awesome WA!
175967615,"Oh ok, I see, well yes I hope it’s soon, the afternoons are better for me ...mornings are bad ...but I believe I will get better and be able to be back where I was before"

175967619,Me too 100% BB . Prefer winter over summer any day all day Everyone here loves summer too. I hate it. The humidity makes it so much worse I'm not equipped to be in the sun. I overheat easily and sweat a lot. The sun is so bright and hot it gives me sensory overload. Sometimes when I'm driving all I can think abt is getting inside away from this evil sun. I dont have AC in my car and the sun visor broke off on my driver's side so sometimes its sheer torture!!!!!! I'm sure it's been getting over 100 degrees F inside my car. When I have to sit at long af redlights sometimes I'm scared i might pass out Anyway yea ... brutal cold and snow is way easier to deal w for me
175967620,"Oh, man, that sounds killer!!"
175967621,"MV, I agree that it may be helping more than you realize. If you are having only the occasional break through challenges, then it is worth it to stay the course with your current med...and yes, talk to your doctor because you do have room to increase, which could help you reach your therapeutic level that you need. The other thing I recommend doing is keeping a journal, so you can track and see progress, patterns, set backs...and have a written account of your journey for reference. Best to you and keep us updated! _PERSON_"

175967624,"My friend visited this afternoon for a longish visit. It was great. I forgot to ask if he'll take me to a bar. I just want one or two drinks. No more than that. I didn't try to call my mother yesterday. I did try once today but there was no answer. I feel heavy and exhausted. I didn't sleep much last night. I'm going to try to get a regular Coke now. I hope I do, I'm really wanting one. Hope everyone's ok."

175967626,arrhythmia?
175967627,sounds like your mom was emotionally abusive anyways.
175967628,"Hi, Bik31. Good luck with the Zoloft. Exercise can be a great component to overcoming anxieties and panic attacks like you've been experiencing lately. It can also help with depression, as exercising on a regular basis can give you the runner's high, as exercising can boost certain chemicals (neurotransmitters) in your brain, making you feel better."
175967629,Drank a second coffee today. I usually only drink one. Feeling mental jitters. Very good..

175967631,Aww thanks! I am a musician too btw haha I play guitar and drums mainly. I miss my drums so fckn much. They are at my dads. I air drum while I’m living here. But I brought my sisters old guitar and my ukulele tho.
175967632,Hi Searching Sorry to hear you having a tough week and also sorry to hear of the passing of a family member I send my condolences to you and your family. _PERSON_
175967633,Hi Just started taking citalapram 6 days ago and wow it is still slow to work. I sleep for about 2 to 3 hours a night and I feel like I am going to crawl out of my skin. Any suggestions to help me. I live alone and that can be scary now with the virus
175967634,"Alcohol is the only thing that even comes close, and it takes a few tall one's to feel anything at all. I jjust.. gave up on this, the only reason I live is to write now. Nobody will finish my books if I don't."
175967635,"Yes I'm still on that, I take 300mg. I might see about getting off of it though, I don't think I need it anymore. Does that cause anxiety?"
175967636,"I took a hiatus from ""Mindhunter"" even though I am almost finished because it's too unrelentingly grim, which is uncharacteristic of me, but it kept toggling from one unpleasant plotline to the other with no lightness to contrast them, which made it boring. Also because I got distracted by seeing the best movie ever made. Every schizoid should see it. Ostensibly, it's about a guy who sits on a couch and plays Pac Man for six months. As far as I know it's only on Amazon but you should just buy the bluray whether you want to see it or not. I expect every user here to post his or her receipt by the first of December. At that time, I will foe anyone who hasn't bought it. Please note this trailer is bad and not well representative of the film. I was advised to look at it as two more episodes of the show. As a movie, it was uneven and the pacing was bad, but otherwise it was great. Yesterday I started this horror anthology by women called XX. The first story was excellent, the second was beyond terribl
e, so I'm unsure if I will continue. Perhaps I will watch the rest while eating meals, which would have been a disservice to something like El Camino, since quality entertainment should not have to share your attention with food."
175967637,My cat threw up twice last night and peed twice in the doorway. Shes declining so fast now...
175967638,Hi! My name is _PERSON_. I am new to this site and I was just wondering if there were any others who have been diagnosed with ADHD? I am 41 years old and I just received my ADHD diagnosis last week! I was previously diagnosed with GAD and MDD and have struggled with those for years. I was prescribed medication for the ADHD and today is only day 4 since I started taking it. I was hoping to connect with some others who have already been down this road so I can kinda know what to expect. Thanks!
175967639,"Yeah I am kind of dealing with similar stuff. I mean I am looking for a new pdoc now. I called one this morning. I thought I was doing the right thing the last 6+ years, but turns out maybe I could improve. So that's why I am searching for a new pdoc. Not saying that's going to be the end of all the pain, but still, it's something. Something worth living for. Of course, there will be ups and downs. But I believe by trying, we are affirming our existence and our power as individual human beings. Try reading some _PERSON_, haha. Or not. But still. We for sure need to empower ourselves as individuals who struggle with these types of challenges. That is the whole nucleus of the problem, I think! At least for me it is. When I don't seek help, I feel worse. It's not that simple, and I'm certainly not suggesting that by seeking help we will automatically be cured and all the evils will go away and we'll feel loads better immediately. But at least it's something we can do to try. And we can try again the n
ext day."
175967640,SK this is for you...
174358328,Yep only four days! Adding abilify....well it is known to work very quickly...i have used it and it works better as a combo. Ir may boost the lexapro ? Possible shrinks reasoning. Give the lexapro some uptake time. Generally faster acting. Keep HT. Abilify no probs weaning.
175967641,I hope you'll get through it fine.
174358324,"I am doing well again. I was feeling really stressed out from work last week because of an incident with one student who did not want my corrections. But, today I rested and feel a whole lot better. I ate out and had a good time by myself. Then, I returned home and vegged for awhile. Afterwards, I cleaned my apartment and now am washing my clothes again. I threw out the trash. I feel renewed again. Thank God for my days off! The company is taking a vacation in about two week for about three days. I will cherish this time off although I won't be making money. I know my mental stability is more important than money so am really enjoying my days off by myself. I am glad I did not meet anymore people from the dating app. I just met the Italian man who I don't want to meet anymore because he is too weird for my head. I am happy alone for now. I will go out again tomorrow to shop for food and may be eat out for lunch. I am happy!! I was not this morning though. Rest really makes me feel good and recharge
d. Now, tomorrow, it is back to the grind again. I believe, I can focus a whole lot better this week!"
175967642,"I'm trying to get a 365 day streak on Duolingo learning Italian. I'm on day 2, got a long way to go but I think I can do it. If I can remember to check stupid things like facebook everyday multiple times a day there's no reason I can't remind myself to jump onto duolingo once a day and do a lesson or two. I'm also planning on working on ukulele again, practicing several times a week. And exercising, walking most days. I'm trying to read more books and spend less time on social media. Reddit is hard to stay away from haha and youtube, and pinterest, and facebook. I still want to keep it all in my life just more in moderation and putting other stuff ahead of that. I'll still be here often though and on the Animal Crossing forum I joined recently."
175967643,I gotta update it
175967644,I feel weird idk if it's from the abilify shot or stooping 400mg of thorazine in 2 days
175967645,"No it's okay, you're not"
175967646,My _NAME_ books got delivered today. My AP keeps me from being able to read as much as I used to. IDK if it is a focus thing or a motivation thing or what. The Vyvanse doesn't offset it enough. But...I'm hoping I can really get into these books and do some serious reading! I'm excited. My parents said they already brought the package into the house.
175967647,"My heart breaks reading this, _PERSON_. Noone desrves that kind of abuse. Much love to you!!!!!!!!!"
175967648,Just had a clementine
175967649,Oh sorry two is right...I’m just surprised you got them so early.....
175967650,Good morning
175967651,"I’m ok, thank you , just lonely. Thinking about making my closet into a book nook. It’s got a weird step up to get to the closet but it’s big enough to lay in and has a neat little light in it. It’s also got a weird slant in it that I could make into a little armrest or back rest or something. Pics one day if I ever get it made!"
175967652,Even though I slept fine last night I somehow fell asleep for another 4 hours today
175967653,I didn't take any Ativan last night. Maybe I should take some now.
175967654,Oh damn.. Is that why my doctor was concerned about me suddenly stopping the Seroquel?
175967655,"Great my roommate is having her nieces and nephew for, ""atleast two weeks."" I don't like this. 1st, this is quarantine time. second, when are they going to leave. Third, now I have to share a small place with 3 extra children who will be nowhere but my home. The place is going to turn into a pigsty like it always is when they are here. I don't like this and it has ruined my mood. I'm angry."
175967656,"I've noticed that difference is that when I'm paranoid, I freak out about people trying to surveil me and cover up my camera with tape.. But even then, I feel like ""they"" are looking through the tape.. It's very mentally painful. I'm sorry you're going through this. You need better living conditions.. Like to go outside and vape, etc.. You've been in that place for so long.. I hope you find peace. Right now, I feel like people might be spying on me but I don't care - Although I'd like a VPN again just so my IP doesn't sell any of my future data. I'm pretty relaxed right now though. Yeah candy can feel like olanzepine for sure.. It spikes your insulin and makes you sleepy I think? Try to have a good sleep tonight, wake up feeling refreshed... You'll feel better in the morning maybe.. Just set your mind to that.."
175967657,"I have heard about dopamine fasts too, not sure if they work either. Yeah makes sense. I guess I shouldn’t be too hard on myself about being human and needing that extra hope sometimes."
175967658,I'm feeling unmotivated. Maybe having few tokes will help.
175967659,"I've had OCD, anxiety, and depression all my life. Nothing has really helped but my Faith and an understanding room-mate. I also had bunion surgery and worry all the time about recovery. Colitis on top of all this. So much need a friend during this pandemic. Can anyone relate? Would love to talk. _NAME_."
175967660,I’m super sensitive to alcohol on the AP...can’t have more than half a glass.

175967664,"Dropped off my lithium prescription yesterday, it didn't get filled so I called this morning and they went ahead and filled it. This makes me uncomfortable for some reason, that they didn't fill it until I called, like I was forgotten or something. God, I hate pharmacies."
175967665,"This... and I find so many people take offence if your opinion differs to theirs. My opinions are often philosophical /instinctive in nature. On certain forums, other members want stats and facts to back up opinions. So, I have given up expressing opinions on forums also. It is no big deal. I prefer allowing them to come and go while in my own headspace without the need to voice them or be heard. Mostly the kind of topics other people have strong opinions on, and invest a lot of energy in, don't matter to me.eg. I don't give a ###$ that - a pedophile was recently released after spending 7yrs in jail. - an employee working for my cousin was caught stealing. - The Brexit thing... no deal, or hard deal. These topics are consuming those around me at the moment."
175967666,"Cool, I’ll probably buy the expansion pass next month"
175967667,"I did a lot today thanks to the 60mg of Vyvanse. I'm doing really good on this dose - 10mg of olanzepine stops the DP/DR in the evening. The day went by really quick though - But I'm progressing. Since I'm not getting DP/DR anymore, I can push the elasticity of my brain to do more than 2 things. I've decided to not microdose psilocybin at all right now. I'm gonna read a chapter from 3 books each, listen to a _NAME_ or _NAME_ podcast while I do the house chores for my mom, continue watching at least two of the philosophy videos and being mindful. Other options are reading interesting things on wikipedia, futurism and learning about famous people that changed the world - This all just kills time while I'm not working or going to school and helps to train my brain to proper neuroplasticity change with the olanzepine. Was thinking about the nuclear fusion reactors in the sky and looked at my horoscope and it was good - Before my trip, I would have thought they're stupid but I believe in manifestation. 
I have a button on my macbook that I can press to look at the things I'm doing and I write them down - It's pretty cool. I'm in quite a positive mood and didn't take phenibut today. I also feel depressed and just trying to do my best in complete isolation. I'm used to being isolated - It's nothing new. I think my meds are perfect rn. I can't mess that up. It's week 6 into the Invega Trinza injection.. Not too sedated, not too symptomatic."
175967668,"Well, I have two brand-new roommates and they're already friends. I rarely talk so I'm usually left out."

175967671,You are so welcome. I found this support online and find it very helpful... just an exchange w ppl who go thru similar stuff. It is hard enough to go thru it alone. And there is no in person support these days. I have been looking for a while. I guess it has to wait 7ntil after COVID. You hang in there. Reach out any time. Today the sun is out and I am taking dogs for a walk. Vitamin D and sun and exercise are important..!

175967680,"Hi I'm a lifelong social phobic with bouts of severe depression and sometimes with panic attacks. I am so miserable that I don't get up until early afternoon just to make my days shorter. I was traumatized by a near drowning incident when I was small child and was a shy youngster before that. I must've been unconscious for a longer period of time because I don't remember coughing up water after CPR. I was messed up after that. I failed the next grade level and had a speech impedament problem. I had a difficult time in school thereafter. I found it difficult to concentrate on my studies. I did manage to graduate from highschool but my social phobia kept me from attending my graduation ceremony, prom dance and all other social events. I have had many doctors, tests and medications over my lifetime with little results. I have managed to hold down a job for over thirty five years and lived independently for most my life. But, I had difficulty, even thoughts of ending my life. It's difficult to describe 
this ugly feeling inside of me. I don't laugh or smile. This turns alot of people off. Can you imagine how frustrating it is for a social phobic with depression to approach others and have them turn away because I don't have a friendly appearance and I have difficulty in striking up a conversation. I grew up in a large family. How did I become so isolated? I currently live in a small motorhome and wonder from campground to campground and somehow had thought that I'd find myself getting out more and hiking in my new environments. It didn't workout that way. I had ended up staying inside alot at campgrounds. I think that this fulltime rv lifestyle is just me trying to leave my problems behind but they just follow me around wherever I go. I shouldn't have quit my job because that was the only place that had forced me to interact with other people even though, I was tense inside due to my social phobia. My parents had passed away many years ago. My older sister died of cancer years ago too. My older sister was th
e healthy one. She had the organic garden, ate healthy foods and exercised regularly. It shook me up to see her in her final days. How cancer had eaten away at her once healthy and lively body. She was one of the sweetest sisters one could of wished for. I had always thought that I'd go first before any of my other brothers and sisters due to my struggles with mental illness. When I'd first started out in my motorhome, it felt kind of good. It was like I freed myself from my mental illness. The great outdoors was going to cure me! I was going to finally experience the happiness that had been missing in my life. I don't have interests. I feel like I'm living on the outside but dead on the inside, if that makes any sense. Holidays mean nothing to me. It's been so long since I've seen any of my brothers or sisters. But, I just don't want to bother them with my problems. People want to be visited by happy, upbeat people. I wish that a person can exchange a life for another one like a suit that doesn't fit right. 
Or maybe, go into a clinic and ask for a shot of happiness like a flue shot that alot of people get once a year. Yeah, that's right. Why can't a vaccine be developed to prevent mental illness. I have been on several different types of medications without much improvement. I've seen many doctors and specialists and had many different types of tests. I have felt good for a little while, naturally, when I had a job that I was performing well at and my boss liked my work, I left work feeling good about myself. That's only when I don't have to work closely with others that would cause problems with my social phobia. I have worked with a team on a job but never fit in due to my inability to socialize comfortable around my coworkers and that had kept me from advancing in all my jobs. Once I start to feel shunned by my coworkers, the depression sets in, job performance suffers and I begin hating my job which would make me quit or get fired and then the depression gets worse because I screwed up another job, blame mys
elf, and start thinking about if heaven really exists and should I go there instead of looking for another job. I have managed about thirtyseven years of employment. I knew that I could of performed my jobs better, made advancements, if my social phobia and depression didn't get in the way. I wasn't a screwoff at work either. I really did want to fit in and feel comfortable around my coworkers and do a great job. Having a job that you do well at gives you dignity and makes you feel wanted. Retiring without overcoming social phobia with depression and wondering around in a rv is a early death sentence."
175967681,"Saw my regular doc today. Apparently my meds are increasing my cholesterol and they want to test to see where it's at now...well, in four months from now (why not now? idk). Might have to add yet another med to my cocktail, boo."

175967685,Woke up at 10:30am. That's a start. I had an hour long sleep paralysis last night. I was looking through one eye and dreaming while the other eye was pressed against my bed and closed. It took like half an hour to realize that I was dreaming and then half an hour to try and wake myself up. It's definitely cuz of the phenibut. It happens with alcohol and also pregabalin.

175967692,"Interesting. I never want any attention at all. I guess that's why social media doesn't appeal to me. I don't ever have the motivation to ""keep score"" of likes or comments. I don't understand why it matters. I find it kind of meaningless. Really, what do you ""win"" in the end? I feel that I am very different from people -- even here. I am always incredibly surprised when I have overlapping interests with anyone. It happens occasionally. But maybe it would be boring if we all had the same problems. Yes, I have opinions.

I assume you’re taking a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride)? Where are you getting your prostate cancer advice? If you’re interested in radiation (Brachy or IMRT), it’s worthwhile going to one of the leading experts — especially if it’s questionable in light of the size of your prostate. Maybe you’ve considered SBRT as well, if you prefer radiation to RP? In any event, while prostate cancer is not a happy occurrence, with your statistics you are very likely to survive it, whatever treatment you choose. So it’s worth focusing on the anxiety so you can enjoy your life..."

Personally, I’ve promised myself that I’m my own best friend, and if I saw a best friend struggling with bad feelings I would do anything I could to help them not feel that way anymore. So I help myself by erasing the time-blocks I have for the rest of the day and start back from square 1: “What do I want to do? What do I need to do? What is the root reason WHY I don’t want to avoid doing these things? How long will each item take me to do? How much time do I have left in the day? I will start in less than 5 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, go.”"""

That's why I said that people dont even have to believe in a religion fully. It doesnt matter in the end cuz we all die and go to some random place, or if you want, you become star dust again like before we were born. I hope you get to the place where you don't feel the need to fade away. But I feel like that when I'm doing bad as well. All this stuff is what people can talk forever. That's why I like talking and thinking about it because its philosophical in a way. People lose their minds over this type of thinking in tripping. You cry, then all of a sudden, you're laughing. People are really crazy. I feel like I'm in a dream. And it's an ok dream right now. I'm just interested in buddhism because of the ""succering is inevitable"" thing.

It's just a thing we have to accept. It sucks for you because you've built an immunity to them for the most part. I dont even know what I'm doing anymore with my thinking.

175967769,"A person deserves to be treated with dignity, kindness and respect. The examples you shared about their relationship don't appear to reflect those things. I'm curious if your friend would think it appropriate if she were to treat anyone without dignity, kindness and respect. I've noticed with some people I personally know, they accept being treated in a way they themselves would never treat another person. Something I've been told by at least a couple of those people is that in childhood, when they were developing their own self-esteem, someone who had influence over them taught them to believe that they weren't worthy human beings. (Worthy of respect, kindness, being loved because they are human and not because of what they can achieve, etc.) My cousin's roommate was dealing with a difficult relationship that in some ways seem similar to the one you described. Her counselor introduced her to the concept of codependency. While that may or may not be the case with your friend, perhaps she might want 
to bring the topic up with her counselor. There are many books written about co-dependancy so if she has yet to establish with a counselor, she might find reading one of the books helpful in formulating questions that she can ask a counselor when she chooses one. Now, that all being said, I have found that there are a significant number of people to whom you can give perfect advice and yet they still won't choose to take it. Ultimately we each have to make our own choices regardless of what others suggest. If I had a friend who was going through struggles similar to your friend's, I would strongly suggest that a professional counselor might be of great help to her. I would also tell her that she deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, compassion and love. Reminding her of that is what I consider the best thing I could do for my friend and I feel it would be more valuable than any advice. In my experience, intimate relationships that are lacking in dignity, respect, compassion and unconditional love brin
g nothing but heartache and are doomed to failure. We can only be happy if we're true to ourselves and we can't be true to ourselves if we don't love ourselves- which I know is easier said than done. I sure hope things work out positively for your friend."

It didn't calm her down at all. I think it made her a little more manic, but in a weird stupor. She only took it for a little while. She would repeat her words when on it. Like I say I don't think it was a good match for her. I had a friend that took it when he was in the service. It made his face real red. And after that medications started to work opposite on him. Something that was suppose to speed him up would calm him down and if it was meant to calm him it would speed him up. These are just different situation I know of.

But psychiatric technicians who work in mental hospitals and psychiatric wards help people in a different way. Psych techs aren't trained therapists. Instead, it's their jobs to keep patients in mental hospitals and psych wards safe. For example, they make sure that suicidal patients don't harm themselves while in the hospital. Psych techs certainly do help others. I think that's awesome. However, if you're thinking of becoming a psychiatric technician, be aware that the pay is low. And it's one of the most stressful ways to make a living."

175967815,"Hello, this is weird to me. I never had to do something like this my entire life. I have always known myself to be strong and independent until I met a girl. She was my everything, my life, and my world. We met 12 years ago while I was overseas. We were both young, in my mid 20's and her early 20's. Being overseas I had no plans on finding a permanent or even a meaningful relationship but she turned that ship right around. Fast forward 12 years later, we have 1 child and live in our first home now for over 5 years. About 2 weeks ago she decided to sleep with someone else. I was devastated and for 40 hours didn't sleep. I still don't really sleep and I guess thats why i'm up at 3am writing this. She isn't fully to blame because I honestly neglected our relationship and although she has hinted in the past that she was not happy, I fought to get her back but once again slipped into complacency and made her unhappy again. Take that as me pushing her towards someone else, but I still think that infideli
ty is the highest crime that can be committed in a marriage and although I was heartbroken I felt her heart empty and she didn't want any part of our relationship anymore. I was finally ready to let go. 1 week after she broke the news to me though, she decided to go to an urgent care because she wasn't feeling well and found out that we were having our second child. She was 8 weeks pregnant. You can't make this stuff up. So we decided to stay together and have been working on making things work again. Although I want her to be happy and am currently doing my best to let things hopefully mend, i get anxiety attacks during the day. My mind races and thinks that she is still talking to or looking for another man to make her happy. I also wonder if one day she'll just cheat again. I am battling with myself every day to stay sane and for the sake of our children I am doing what needs to be done but all I really want to do is end my pain. I call some close friends from time to time and started vaping CBD to calm my 
nerves. I want to be happy with her, I love her so much, but the thought of her with another man kills me and makes me want to do something crazy. It makes me so angry that I can't think straight. I obviously have a hard time sleeping. I try to work out as much as possible to relieve the tension but its only temporary. I'm crying out for help because I want to lash out at everything and anyone who gets in my way and I just don't know what to do anymore. Will I ever be happy again? Can I ever trust her again? I don't know if I can live the rest of my life looking over my shoulder waiting for the day she comes home again to tell me that something happened or she's not happy so she found someone else. Who would want to live with some depressed and unhappy husband? Anyone to talk to or response would be appreciated."

175967818,I had a really nice nap from 4pm-7:30pm. I think it's because of the CBD. The Vyvanse wore off so I'm very unfocused. I went to the coffee connections today from 2pm-3pm and talked with people in town. Right now would be a really nice time to take 5-10mg of Dexedrine IR.
175967819,"I actually tried three types of B12 (the shots, the pills, and the sublingual) I got the shots and the pills while I was deficient in B12 but I take the sublingual from time to time when I feel my energy is too low and muscles too weak. If your doctor prescribed you the shots rather than any other type because you require a very high dose or your B12 levels might be very low and the fastest way to make it go up is the shots. If you are not suffering from B12 deficiency symptoms, you can discuss with your doctor about trying other types (there are chewables too). Anyways, the shots are administered via the muscles. When I was having them, I did not experience any side effects or bad reactions instead they really made me feel better."

175967835,"By ""simulation theory"", do you guys mean a ""we live in the Matrix"" sort of thing? If so, then unless it is proven (with some kind of information that's clearly from outside our ""simulverse"" somehow ""leaking"" or being brought in here), it can't possibly prove anything. Metaphysics has no business proving things. There's that too, though I rarely remember dreams, so that's not really a defining trait of sleep for me. I think what actually defines the experience of sleep is the experience of both a level of continuity and a level of discontinuity between what you experienced before you fell asleep and what you're experiencing as you wake up. Or in short, awakening is what defines the experience of sleep. And death is nothing like that."
175967836,I’ve been very bad at hygiene lately. I shower once or twice a week. I often sleep in my clothes. I’ve been barely brushing my teeth. I worry about my teeth.

Hopefully I can keep this up and the dentist doesn’t notice that I’ve been slacking on basic mouth hygiene. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
175967837,"It is good to have piece of mind. In the meantime continue with coping skills for the anxiety. The anxiety magnifies everything. Makes everything worse. Do you do any deep breathing exercises? They help with breathing and heartrate. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. It is called smelling the roses and blowing out the candles. That should help with anxiety some until you see the doctor again. My husband seems to be having issues with his heart too. Something is clogged up and he might have surgery. But it is suppose to be simple and they go in through his leg. Freaky to me. I just want it to be over and him have a good outcome.

Last year I was using 30-50mg for depression every 2-14 days. I think those doses decreased anxiety. But I'm not going to chance it again.

175967850,"I once saw a TV show on scuba divers who went into sunken boats. And some of them would get into the vessel and couldn't find their way back out, going backwards, One of the commentators who was a scuba diver said, ""Once you get into the first level of trouble, start backing out."" Meaning, don't get into one more level of difficulty than you can handle. If you get in past your limit, you might be in real trouble, is the way I interpreted it with problems in general. It sounds like you're in about 3 or 4 levels of trouble. I mean, it's pretty easy to understand why you're having a difficult time. One of those levels might be difficult enough, but 3 or 4? I think if you can deal with each of them separately and be positive that you can solve it, it might help. Can you be positive about each one? As far as getting dropped by a narcissist type, I was dropped at about age 20 by a girl who just used me to get into a group until she could be comfortable with that. She very coldly contacted me, used me t
o get into the group, then very coldly dropped me. I think she was cold, never thought of the term narcissist. It was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, and maybe you. After she dropped me, I saw her going after bigger fish, probably seeking after the lawyer/doctor type. In a way, the loser may have been the last guy in the chain who she married, and found out a year or two later what kind of person she was. You sound like you've already figured this guy out, with his narcissistic tendencies, and his narcissistic discard, which I'm reading says is the person he first covets, then treats badly, then he drops for another love interest. Did he treat you badly toward the end of the relationship?"

175967852,"The most important thing that led to my recovery from serious mental illness was being denied Social Security Disability Income. I’m grateful we have a social safety net. It’s important to help people pull themselves up, and to provide care for those who cannot support themselves because of serious disability. The net may not be cast broad enough, as too many people who need help are denied services. However, some sort of meaningful work is crucial to heal, and to regain productivity and independence. I believe that many, if not most, people with mental illness want to recover and to successfully manage life with illness. They achieve wellness by applying the treatments prescribed for them, and by using whatever adjunct therapies work for them. Still others work just as hard but are tragically treatment resistant and find little solace. https://blogs.psychcentral.com/older-bipolar/2019/11/meaningful-work-is-the-best-therapy/"

Would they ( family or whoever frequents your immediate environment ) repeat back at you things in which you do not speak out loud about, either your journal entries or self-talk, would they be goading you for a response. Would you get unusual or unnatural attention when out in public, would it involve IPhones users or by way of gesturing via hand signals or carefully chosen words or phrases. Would you have momentary Tinnitus which maybe a tonal sound and hurt the inside of your middle ear?

You have to choose for now instead of the future because the APs and the illness are slowly destroying our brains and our bodies. I ve always tried to be healthy but what’s the point when the meds induce metabolic syndrome, however my pdoc was like it could be much worse if you werent fighting it.

Ssi is determined on an income based. _PERSON_ is determined based on hoe many quarters you’ve worked in your life (you need 40 quarters at the LEAST which is 5 years.

My sister does this and it is the only way she can get through going in to see the doctor or dentist. Making a dry run is another trick. Driving to your dr's office a few times and sitting in the waiting room for a few minutes and then leaving can help desensitize you to the environment a bit...making the real appointment time a little easier. Finally do you have someone who can take you. Someone who is understanding of your fears and can keep you calm and distracted? Trying all of these coping mechanisms can help you get through this. It may not ever be a pleasant experience...but at least you will be able to get it done. Best to you with this and keep us posted. S.C."

175967942,Can't seem to get over this obsessive hunger. Nothing is filling me up. I've been eating larger portions and more frequently. i've probably gained back the 17 pounds i lost from the Geodon I took for a month. I'm tired of being fat. Really pissed that they cut my food stamps. Not that it matters because my parents can afford to feed me but I like to get my own food. Parents have a tendency to buy junk foods high in calories and less filling. I would use my disability check but most of it goes to bills and rarely do i buy anything for myself. I did buy myself 140 dollar pair of headphones from my check this month but it's probably the only thing i'm going to buy for myself. probably shouldn't but mom said she wouldn't take as much money from me this month. I hate depending on my parents. Ugh. I guess it's better than being homeless like i was one time. I'm 29 i should be living on my own. God i feel like a failure. So much negativity. I'm trying to think of the positives. I have new headphones that i 
can drown out the voices speaking to me. I'm not sleeping a whole lot like some of the other antipsychotics make me do.

175967944,"Yes, it does sound like you are going through it. It may be that you are just not on the right medicines, and before you reach that there can be that time when everything is out of sorts. From what you are saying, you’ve been taking 60 mg of Prozac (for panic disorders net says) for years. When your situation got worse, you asked for a refill of a med that had worked for you years ago, Klonopin. Your psy. instead added, to the Prozac, Buspar, which net says is for general anxiety and can be used as needed. But you’re still having problems, saying, “I decided to suck it up and start the buspar. Bc of my fears, I only took 1/4 of a tablet. Didn't sleep any better. Had anxiety. Got up with panic attack. Crying sobbing couldn't breath. Couldn't even do to work. I can't have this affecting my ability to work.” I think one of the problems is you're going in circles. Hey, I've done the same thing, and I didn't have any net to help me out, and I just got worse because my negative thinking was addin
g to my emotional problems. He gave you more medicine, but you don’t want to take it. I think you’re going to have to overcome yourself here, which is good, for we can control ourselves. One of your problems is your fear of medicine, which is what you need, medicine. They have a medicine for anxiety, Buspar, but you won’t take it. So the problem is not the medicine or the doctor it’s you. Which is good, for we can control ourselves. We can take our medicine. Exactly. So why don’t you be a good girl and take your new medicine? Why don’t you give that a try and see what happens? In addition to my medicine, Mirtazapine for depression and Lithium for mania, I take Melatonin health food from the health food store. Or maybe the drug store or grocery store has it in the health food section. Or over the net. You can take it an hour or two or three before bedtime."

I know that they want to portray it as some kind of a monk but the _USER_ID_ is involved in the world, they participate in the world’s order unlike monks (though they did portray them closer to monks in another trilogy). _PERSON_ wouldn’t have gone to the dark side if the _USER_ID_ was being responsible to his needs as a child. I’m a chaotic good. I will only follow orders that makes sense to me. Yeah the D and D rule set might help. Thanks for the suggestion.

175967966,"And I guess I'll be calling my cardiologist in the morning. I am so tired of this. I had them on and off all day, again. Probably about an average of 10 per hour that I could feel likely more that I didn't feel or didn't register. So I decided to go out for my evening walk that I have done for years, ten minutes making laps around my property for 30 minutes. It's not unusual for my to have an ectopic beat of some sort while I am out walking. Five or six wouldn't be unusual in fact. However, today, I started having so many I actually took out my phone and started keeping track of just how many I was having. I ultimately finished my walk (no symptoms of any sort) with an average of one ectopic heartbeat per minute (I registered between 30 and 35 of them during my walk. This has discouraged me all over again. I did notice it took a few minutes into my walk before I noticed the first ones, and then as I got to the end of my walk they seemed to be coming less often. It's not quite as bad as when I had t
aken the beta blocker and they kicked into high gear, but it is close. Probably the worst they've ever been without an outside agitator of some sort. I haven't done anything different. I haven't changed anything. The only difference is I had to take time off of walking during the holidays due to both family get togethers and poor weather conditions. Even then, I'd get on my walk board and do 30 minutes once or even twice a day. I think I may have lost some weight in the last several months, but I figured that'd help the PVCs/PACs go away. At any rate, here I am once again ready to pound my head through a wall in frustration. It wouldn't bother me so much if they wouldn't change up every time something happens to drive me crazy. It would also help if I would notice these things at an hour when I could actually call and get some reassurance from my cardiologist."

I do not blame my psychiatrist. I was starting to go down the rabbit hole of depression and thought maybe it had to do with a recent change. When I called the practice the only person I could see quickly was the new P.A. I saw her and she increased a med. The next week she added a med. Sigh. The past week and a half have been awful. Once again, I was really confused. I had no idea where I was living when I woke up. I did know what my house looked like beyond the bedroom door. I thought I would see a circular driveway from the house we lived in twenty years ago, but instead the big pine in front of my own house I called my mom and explained the confusion.

While I did a year ago but never participated til now. But I wish I knew people irl who gamed n stuff. I go through my two phases of gaming and writing. It’s been that way for like a year now. Or 10 months, one. I like how u can get a house in these games and live in a complete fantasy world. It’s not the game so much but the social aspects I like. Sooooo much stuff to do. Like buy horses, run a farm, fish, buy houses, buy even unicorns and ride in a open world setting."

175968024,Thank you for your response. I was on an antidepressant for a few years with much success and I’m considering starting it again. My family dr suggested I stop BusPar and go back on it.

The trigger was an isolated incident so that’s good but now my mind is stuck in a panic loop.

I told everyone I didn't like her and for my mom to be careful with her. She's probably still doing coke. I feel sorry for her in a way cuz she thinks she's ugly and she really isn't (Just has wrinkles - Which she should be happy that she made it to be 45) and wants to date ""boys"" my age. It's weird.

175968035,"Hello _PERSON_, I'm sorry your having a tough time. I am not a therapist or professional but enjoying sharing and giving support on this platform. After reading your post I feel like your difficulty with self-love and acceptance of love may stem from your past??? In my case it was child abuse. I never ever thought some of my problems stemmed from that until I went to counselling. She said I have PTSD. Literally, I had no clue. Once I came clean with my therapist, we worked on how to deal with the stuff from the past. She told me to put in in a ""make believe box"". Yes its still there, but locked up in a box. I then was able to learn new skills and seriously look at myself in the mirror, Overall, I'm a good person and believe you are the same!!!!!!!! Give yourself a nice break from all the stress and expectations society brings to the table. We are all free to choose our own paths!!!!!!!!!! No matter what we do, we will be judged by someone else. My favorite saying is, no one is going to rent any m
ore space in my head!! Take a deep breath my friend and look into the mirror and say to yourself, I am beautiful, smart and I love myself. Do that everyday and before you know it, you will believe it because it's true!! My feeling that in order to except love, one must love them self first!! I'm no expert, just sharing what I have learned through years of counseling. Take it one day at a time!! I'll be praying for you :)) _USER_ID_"

Didnt get home till 8pm. Now shes able to go for walks. We took her to the dog park last night. Then yesterday, we went to meet my mom and had lunch. It was good. At the new Buccees.

175968038,"It’s hard on us all to watch the news rn. I think as people who have mental illness we should maybe try to stay away from the news or use curated news that we want to see and doesn’t affect us in a negative way. At the same time, it is important to know what’s going on in the world. Just don’t feast your eyes or ears on it for too long."

These companies always come out with better hardware like 3 years into the console's life, and there is usually a price cut involved with the ""slimmer"" versions. Plus, the economy is crap and will take years to recover according to analysts, so I expect a price cut at some point, possibly even 1 year into the console's life because many cannot afford the leaked Target price ($399 for the discless version)."

175968044,"Pdoc appointment yesterday...an emergency one. First off he is leaving as of 12/31/19. He is going to a different city and going cash only. Not sure I can afford him. Not going to be easy seeing about a new one as where I live it’s kind of rural. Also the whole counseling service is up for sale. As of 12/31/19 I might lose my T and for sure I’m losing my pdoc. This sucks. As for the appointment, there wasn’t much he could do with my meds as I am on the highest doses already. So we are going to augment with alternative medication. He is ordering me some vitamin B something. Then he had me go to Costco and get some _NAME_-E. He gave me a book to read and a 40 page paper. Apparently some people have a gene or a variant that makes anti depressants not that effective. He thinks I have that. I told him he is breaking my heart by leaving. I’m sad and upset and scared."

Now, I feel like normal people go through this regularly.. But it can't happen to me anymore because I feel like it damages my brain - Unless it's necessary for growth? I remember sitting through a chat of toxic people posting pepe gifs - And I feel all of the hate that they give to minorities and their careless existence, sociopathy and narcissism. I'm an empath. I'm not even really supposed to be learning anymore it seems. Instead I just need to heal people - But I have to go for the strenuous battle of turning my mind inside out for what meaning? I suppose I should finish that book. People have been through crazy trauma and still manage to function.. Why? Because they let people know about what's going on inside their minds (MDMA talk therapy allows people to open u
p for example). And all of the exhaustion - Of the self, the world, the pure madness.. I suppose that I should just let go and surrender to shame, guilt, people taking advantage of me and controlling me and just never give up."

175968057,"It was hell, but was also strangely enough, the best time of my life. I was healthier, more active, with a sense of purpose. I just could not sustain it, which is unfortunate, but I had a glimpse of something else, a possibility. As for the alone time, maybe you could look at how you would look at it. Let's say you have plans and habits with someone else, probably it would annoy you if the other would just disappear. Its mainly a question of expectations, not so much about bad per say. Its no different than someone that would not show up for work, it disrupts. And those are relationships as well, even if mainly practical ones. And of course, doing well does not make it better, it makes the expectations higher. You don't get brownie points for doing work and then stopping. You get them for doing work constantly, even if on average it is lower. This is mostly because of proximity bias, where you are only good as your last interaction or action. Let's say you have a work load of 100 widgets and you ha
ve one week to do it. If you make the 100 widgets in two days and then expect to do nothing, think again. People will simply ask for 250 widget instead, or think you are lazy, even though the others take 5 days for the 100 widgets, because it is expected. They might applaud you on day 2 and 3, then hate you on day 4, 5 and 1, until you start producing again. So in the end, you will be called inconsistent, which is bad."

Went to the doctor today and med change like I said. Went out for burgers tonight. Dogs doing well. Cat doing well. Everyone doing well. Doctor says I might be a little symptomatic. I feel like I have more to say but I don’t know what it is. Make me sound more crazy trying to explain I guess. Guess I’ll try to sleep instead. I’m sleeping more normal now but less than when I was on the seroquel. Doctor says to keep an eye on that.
175968062,That’s great news ?
175968063,"_NAME_, do you think my agitation and excessive outbursts are anxiety related? I've always thought it was just bc I didn't work harder to control my emotions. I've been told I'm a little high strung at times, not all the time, I am happy to veg on the couch with a book or my phone and not move. I'm getting more scatter brained and my ability to multi task tactfully isn't as good as it use to be. I use to be able to carry on a conversation with someone on the phone, at work, while helping someone standing in front of me and be able to remember everything each of them said. Now, if I don't pull myself to focus on what 1 person is saying, I can't comprehend what was said. Idk if that makes sense. Like if husband walks into living room and starts talking, if I don't stop what I'm doing, look at him and actually... Turn off my current thought process, I know he's speaking but I can't comprehend what the words he's saying even mean. Hmmm... That doesn't make sense but I'm not sure how else to explain it.

175968064,Hello guys so I’m back with an update. I went to see my regular doctor today and I explained I was going through some stress and for that reason my anxiety has been triggered. I explained I went into a walk in clinic last week to get some sort of med to relieve my anxiety and how they prescribed Effexor. He explained Effexor is more so for someone who’s depressed which I’m having more anxiety. I do have my moments of sadness as I am going through a separation. But overall it’s the anxiety that gets me! He said if lexapro has worked for me in the past then why switch it? So he wants me to try lex and also prescribed clonazepam. I have yet to start lexapro. I forgot to ask him to write “brand name” on the prescript ion or thinking if I should give the generic a try. These medicines scare me
175968065,I took my Rx & also supplements.
175968066,"The tiz finally helped, but it didn't knock me out. I tossed and turned last night. I woke up in less pain but with horrible restless legs. Im hoping it will go away soon. They haven't brought my meds yet. I'm scared."
175968067,"I've been feeling at peace lately. I'm calm, in control, I'm doing well. I don't feel miserable either. Also, I forgot what it was to feel the butterflies, and that forgetfulness closed me off from peace. I've been friend zoned, but that's perfectly fine with me. It's always good to have another friend. But I really needed that window to remember what it felt like."

175968072,I have some form of social anxiety. Around people I get nervous and can’t maintain eye contact and feel like I’m going to dissociate. I touch my hair a lot to calm and distract myself.
175968073,"FaithInGod84, I am so sorry that you are going through this. From growing up with a sister that was bipolar I, I know that the environment is toxic and hard to deal with at times. I can remember not wanting to get out of bed in the morning because I was afraid of what was going to happen. I just want to let you know that there is light on the other side. I know that there are not many options right know due to COVID-19 quarantine, but there are many support groups out there. I chose to do person counseling to be able to find ways of coping and reacting to my sister. I started therapy when I was 16 years old. My therapist taught me ways of coping with my sister by putting headphones in and removing myself from the situation. I know that with this person being your mother it will not be easy to do that and still show respect. But, remember that there is help out there for you and never settle and just think that is ""normal"". I do not know much about your situation, but is your mother taking medicat
ion?"
175968074,"I think I might have too much going on in my life. I have so much stuff going that that each thing doesn’t have enough time for the time I need to each thing, you know? Like I can only allot so much time to each thing a day and it’s not enough time for each thing. Plus I have absolutely no time to relax whatsoever. At all. Not to mention emergency situations that arise like today or with my dad 2 weeks ago. It’s not a nightmare, but I’m exhausted every single day. I haven’t been getting sleep because I’m manic, but actually I mostly get a good nights rest because I Do much so much. (It’s taken me 10 min to write this cuz I don’t even have time to do this)"
175968075,"Yes and that’s always my grave mistake I make... thinking people MIGHT understand and I get proven wrong time and time again. But the few people I know that do understand is why I take chances on people understanding. I just have to go through a lot of BS people to get there. Idk a better way My mom won’t ever understand and Idk why I can’t get over that. _PERSON_ understands sometimes but sometimes he is not understanding and gets really frustrated with me and it’s extremely hurtful. He said the reason we have a mouse in the house was because I don’t keep it clean. Which I don’t think that’s it. They were there, along with these roaches, the 3rd day we were in here and it was as clean as it could be I suppose and just otherwise not cluttered. I also ask him tho to clean his plates or use the disposable ones most of the time and he doesn’t listen. He is also messier than me, WAY WAY WAY messier. So idk how I’m the sole proprietor to this mouse being in here or anything else. My da
ds house as cluttered as it was didn’t have roaches."

175968078,"getting by said... If it is leaking during a heavy storm, that happens and doesn't mean it will leak all the time. I would see if it leaks during just regular rain before I worry about replacing it. It has been windy here for days and I get anxiety just with wind. It has been sunny though so if I stay inside I am okay. But wind alone makes me nervous. I don't know why. Have a good day. I wonder if it is the storm or just you are stressed as a home owner. I remember you talking about it before. I am a home owner too. But I am lucky, mine is paid for. Keep hanging in there. You will feel better as the storm passes. Hugs, _NAME_... Oh ok. I noticed earlier that it didn’t leak when it was raining normally. When it started to rain very heavily then I noticed some drops of water coming down. This is my first home so I am very stressed about it. Once I get a new roof and some other stuff replaced I won’t worry about it."

I get terrible cramps in my legs & feet if I am not hydrated enough too. I use to not drink much water, now, that's all I drink & plenty of it. HT is right about magnesium. My SIL works in the heat & his dr has him take magnesium once a day plus he stays hydrated. Well my doctor’s office is closed today but so far today I have no pain or warm sensation either. No swelling either. I have walked around without any pain so far today. I have annual physical exam in less than two weeks so I will monitor my symptoms and ask if they think I should go in sooner. I will make sure to drink plenty of water. I think what I had was a bad cramp and some soreness from it."

One time I went to write an exam and left papers all over the college with something I wrote exposing the ‘truth’ how the government was after me and I was an experimental cyborg. Ah man, good thing I’m medicated. Those were not good times."

I feel less, but also, I can't follow the lyrics at all. I can listen to one song on repeat for 3 hours and I can't tell you the lyrics. Audiobooks I can follow better, but not lyrics in music.

175968098,"Engaging your senses is one of the quickest and easiest ways to quickly self-soothe. You will need to experiment to find out which sensory based which stimulation works best for you. You’ll also need different strategies for different moods. What may help when you’re angry or agitated is very different from what may help when you’re numb or depressed. Here are some ideas to get started: Touch. If you’re not feeling enough, try running cold or hot (but not scalding hot) water over your hands; hold a piece of ice; or grip an object or the edge of a piece of furniture as tightly as you can. If you’re feeling too much, and need to calm down, try taking a hot bath or shower; snuggling under the bed covers, or cuddling with a pet. Taste. If you’re feeling empty and numb, try sucking on strong-flavored mints or candies, or slowly eat something with an intense flavor, such as salt-and-vinegar chips. If you want to calm down, try something soothing such as hot tea or soup. Smell. Light a candle, 
smell the flowers, try aromatherapy, spritz your favorite perfume, or whip up something in the kitchen that smells good. You may find that you respond best to strong smells, such as citrus, spices, and incense. Sight. Focus on an image that captures your attention. This can be something in your immediate environment (a great view, a beautiful flower arrangement, a favorite painting or photo) or something in your imagination that you visualize. Sound. Try listening to loud music, ringing a buzzer, or blowing a whistle when you need a jolt. To calm down, turn on soothing music or listen to the soothing sounds of nature, such as wind, birds, or the ocean. A sound machine works well if you can’t hear the real thing.

175968104,"I realize that it has been several years since this forum was created, but for anyone as confused and curious about SZPD as I was prior to diagnosis, I would like to share some details about my experience with fantasy. The schizoid fantasy is a common symptom in individuals with the disorder but to my understanding, not all people with SZPD have a fantasy life. I personally do. It would be a breach of my perceived anonymity to reveal too much about my own fantasy, but I do rely on it as a substitute for relationships. Specifically, my fantasy follows one individual with many similarities to myself. I feel extremely close to this individual; he is the only person for whom I am capable of feeling love. However, I never interact with him directly. Instead, I follow him throughout his day-to-day life and observe in a similar way to one might follow a character in a book or movie. Despite this, I created another character solely for the purpose of supporting and drawing close to him so that I feel more 
connected. Throughout the years, I have grown increasingly dependent on this individual so much so that his mood or circumstances determine my ability to function or interact for the day. For example, if he hits a rough patch, I become severely depressed and so exhausted that I am unable to communicate. On the other hand, if he is in a particularly good mood, I can pass as borderline friendly. Without him, I would be so withdrawn from the world that I do not doubt that I would currently be quite literally dead. I would have killed myself."

175968131,"Yes, I went to the dr today for this needle stinging sensation on my extremities. He says he is not suspecting a serious ailment. Instead, he wanted some blood tests to make sure it's not blood sugar, B12, or calcium-related. He said it can also be stress-related for real. He was quite informative. He did some quick check-up there also to see if I have problem with sensations or if I have some painful points. I also asked him if those sensations can be related to the Shingles I experienced around 2 months ago and showed him the persistent red and purplish rash remains I still have on the back of my leg. He said no it probably is not as my shingles seem to be fully healed and He doubts my virus is still active in the body. I am still slightly nervous about the needle bitings here and there but I can say they are not strong like the first two days. I hope it's really not some neurological disease."

175968134,"Hi everyone, I suffer from anxiety which is brought on by many things in my life. I have gone to many drs and given many meds. Between covid, chronic pain, fox and cnn news and just my day to day life-- I am struggling to function. I want to say thank you first to anyone who answers and also say I really care and agonize when I know others are in pain or suffering with anxiety. I was not prepared for how my life would turn out. I wish my parents and grandparents would have prepared me for life as a senior. I now talk with my own daughter to try to prepare her for what life will be like when she is my age. I feel as if I am so easily hurt by others now. People who are terse, rude or uncaring literally just break my heart. I just recently had someone close to me suffer a severe heart attack. Things such as this just cause me so much mental anguish. I go to my many drs appointments and honestly they push you in and out so quick I cannot express how I feel as I am rushed so the dr can move to the next 
patient. It seems the dollar is king in this world at times. Please don't misunderstand me I love my drs for the most part. I really appreciate any help they can give me. I used to be such a carefree type of person when younger. Now everything upsets me. The news is always negative. I suffer chronic pain which also makes my days anxious and difficult. I practice mindfulness and other relaxing techniques but with little help. I would like to ask if others here just get to the point where they are ready to just move on from this life? Please know I am not suicidal and have no thoughts of ending my life. I cant help but think there has got to be more to life than anxiety and pain. We live in a world of pain, fear, disease and a host of other problems our society suffers daily. I volunteered at our soup kitchen before covid but now I cant even do this. I try to help others financially when I can but not having much money myself makes it hard to help others. I know life is not all terrible yet the end of our lives 
just bring their own special troubles. I know this is a long message and I thank anyone and everyone who reads through it all. Please people-- just love one another because that is really what is important in life. All the rest is smoke and mirrors. Thanks and Merry Christmas"

If it was only red like blisters I saw previously this morning, I would be OK with waiting to see if meds do any good. But the color of blisters are sort of purplish / dark red now. Well I try to tell myself that there is not much I can do now, but three Dr.s in total saw those in pics and none of them mentioned anything sinister. So I guess this is a good opportunity for me to practice enduring uncertainty and patience And it feels awfully hard to do."
174358955,"Thanks for the previous responses, getting by, theHTreturns, _NAME_ and many other beloved contributors. I'm sure you can guess that I posting at 3.58am in Singapore is an indication that all is still not quite well. To cut the long story short, my Bipolar wife was admitted to IMH hospital(voluntary admission) and stayed there for about a month. Visited her every day with food and my love. After that, she was discharged and is now on 2 pills of Sodium Valproate (500mg each) and 3 pills of Risperidone and 1 pill of Abilify. It was trying initially...sometimes, she would secretly spit out the medicine and hoped I wouldn't notice...However nowadays, she's resigned to the fact that she needs to take them, and sometimes gets water and swallows the pills without a reminder from me... She has been unable to secure a job and even when she did secure one, she left the job after one day. Last week, we went to watch Terminator: Dark Fate together at the cinema and she left the cinema one minute before the mov
ie started to go shopping. Textbook Bipolar 101 for her...I'm not sure about others. That was $7.50 down the drain. Just yesterday, we went to a café for cheese fries and I bought her caffe latte. After eating about 5-6 fries and drinking 3 sips, she said she wanted to go. I think that meal did not stretch past five minutes...some money gone down the drain too...at least I insisted on finishing my iced chocolate. I think I'm posting because I need support again...I'm not posting at another forum because of the negative vibes, but I'm back here because I fully remember the positive vibes here...and I guess that's what I need now. : / I checked my wife's handphone yesterday as I did not want to be taken aback by any future rude shock...she's been messaging this guy again...thankfully, he doesn't really answer her. She said she's thinking about being remarried and she's confused by all the male attention (when there is none). Her logical thinking and judgment is being greatly impaired. Though she did say she lo
ved him like a friend only. That was heartbreaking...but today, she said she missed me and did not ever want to leave me...and said I should consider looking for someone else if I was unhappy. She looked really melancholic and downcast. I told her she was the only girl I would ever love for the rest of my life till the day I died. She smiled momentarily. I know the real her...the real her is being smothered underneath all the Bipolar...the real her would never do anything to jeopardise our relationship. Knowing that and hoping that the real her will return someday, I press on like how _NAME_ wandered in the desert for forty years. Sometimes, I tell God I can't take it anymore and perhaps it might be better to end my life? But He doesn't end it. So, I press on, hoping to find water and respite some day... Nowadays, we do not sleep on the same bed. I've noticed that whenever I sleep on the bed with her, she will get up and not sleep anymore for the rest of the day, which makes her overall mood more unstable. He
nce, she will take her meds at 11+pm, and sleep till about 5+pm...and then I will sleep from then till mid-afternoon because my work starts late due to its unique nature. I know it's not normal, but it is something that I have to accept, till the real her returns. Recently, my wife lamented to me that she was angry with me for not giving her a kid...and she did not want to be lonely in her old age. I reminded her that we had agreed not to have one...for the fact that she was not well enough to have a kid and look after one. She claimed that she was of sound mind, but the reverse is true... Currently, she still whispers to herself...although it is markedly softer...she still makes strange and unsound decisions...sometimes, she will freeze completely and it is as if her soul left and she was in another world. In spite of all this, she makes sure that my lunch and dinner are all taken care of...God bless her soul. I think it's her way of telling me still loves me...even though she says I've become her best frien
d and not lover cos we don't 'do it' anymore... Sometimes, she will hold my hand at the shopping mall...and then suddenly release it...and then hold it...and then release it again...she's trying her best and really struggling and because of that, I cannot give up on her. It pains me to read of so many marriages that end up in divorce because of Bipolar. I don't want to be a part of this statistic, but no one can predict the future...so I can do is do my best and pray to God...what else can I do? I feel that one of the myriad reasons why these marriages break up is because the healthy spouse puts himself or herself above the Bipolar spouse's needs and will not accept anything that is deemed sub-standard. Although each and every person can exercise this right, I find it confounding from a moral standpoint. This is not to criticise or ridicule many people whose marriages have ended up in divorce because of mental illness. Believe me. My first marriage to my wife ended up in divorce (but I subsequently remarried 
her). My point is not to judge anyone. My point is that as the healthy spouse, I am ready to accept that some or most of my needs may not be met, if ever. I recognise true love, and for true love, I am willing to make this sacrifice, even if it is excruciating. I'm sure others think differently, and I will respect that, even if I don't always agree. Ah, what a foolish man, some might say. He should have bailed the first chance he had. Why did he even marry her in the first place? Because my wife(in her normal state) has something that I've never witnessed in many girls. Her humility, kindness and honesty. And she chose to take a risk and love me. So even though the going is very hard, I have to press on...to me, this is the only way. I made a promise before never to leave her, and I never will. I am not sure what tomorrow brings, but I'd like to think that God makes all things right in the end. If you have read so much, I thank you for reading my musings...if you are in the same boat as me, you have the choic
e to exercise any right you want, but I urge you to make it a moral one, even if love has dissipated. It's tempting to take the easy way out, but the course of true love is never smooth. Sometimes, we only find real love once in our life. So, hang in there till even this option exhausts itself... Post Edited (_PERSON_) : 11/20/2019 1:37:02 PM (GMT-7)"

175968143,"Okay, I just have to tell this story quickly because now, later, it is roo funny. I used to take this sleep made that really disinhibted me and caused me not to remember much of anything after I took it. I have been alone fo ra long time and I do occasionally get lonely, though, most of the time, I am just fine with it. Sure, it would be nice to have someone around, but I just could not really manage another person. I can't even handle myself. Anyhow, maybe a year ago, I got readey for bed and took my sleeper. I always just get in bed after that, but this night, I didn't. Apparently, I got on the computer. Or something. So, I wake up the next morning and find I ahve allllllll these messages from allllll these lovely young ladies. Some of them were quite, uh, revealing, I guess you could say. Anyway, I had joined not one, but more than one, dating sites! No idea. No memory whatsoever. I would never normally do that. I still get some messages to this day... So funny. So not me. But when I take that m
ed, all bets are off... That is my dating site story."
175968144,"Not totally schizoid (see my signature), but I'm pretty much the same. I think I'm the same way with most emotions, kind of all or nothing. 99% of the time I'm neutral. If I'm happy or excited, I'm grinning like an idiot and bouncing around. If I'm sad, I'm sobbing. If I'm scared, I'm shaking and sweating. There's really no in between, and those extremes don't happen very often. They don't even have to be triggered by anything particularly major, most often it's stupidly small stuff. Imagining myself in somebody's position doesn't work for me either. I do find it easy to recognize and understand (at least theoretically) people's emotions though, even if I don't share them or think they're ridiculous."

Sometimes we armor ourselves or withdraw to protect ourselves, and then feel worse. Do you spend time with people at all? I feel a bit happier when it's warmer and I spend time in the yard gardening, and neighbors will stop and talk. Or even talking to the postman or the ups driver, or the cashier. Just those little casual conversations about nothing can make a world of difference to me. I sometimes listen to _NAME_ talks to deal with my struggles. (free podcast) She is great at teaching kindness to oneself, forgiveness, trust, etc. I can never learn those lessons enough, but respo
nding to you reminds me of my constant need to instill these ideas in my own heart. Perhaps then I could give you better words of support and encouragement , which is my intention."

175968162,"Hi, I am new here. I was wondering what your guy's take on people who take antipsychotics and become pregnant. What are the chances of relapse if you stay on your medications? I am not pregnant yet, but want to have children. I have read online that you are vulnerable to relapse post partum because of high stress and lack of sleep. I'm really hoping that I hear some success stories? Should I be having children? I do not take drugs or drink alcohol and am doing well on my meds. I am taking Perphenazine 12 mg per day and I do not miss dosages and cannot stop taking my medication because I know I will relapse. So if I get pregnant, I can't stop taking my medication."

175968184,"Manic, was terribly anxious, got that taken care of, then mania is all, ""allow me to reintroduce myself."" It makes me think of things that I normally wouldn't think of. I'm currently thinking of what would happen if the apocalypse came? Would it be sudden? Would all die in a split second? Would it last for ten minutes? An hour? A day? I'm listening to _PERSON_, and I've always said his last three symphonies were his best works. Everyone knows the choir section of the ninth and final symphony, and the tragic thing is that _PERSON_ never got to hear his best piece of music. But anyway, the seventh symphony, mainly the second movement, has always been a doomsday piece for me. There was some movie, I think it was called ""The Knowing,"" but I'm not sure, I'm not a movie person, never have been, but anyway, this what they play when doomsday comes, and it's the perfect fit. I've always felt that this was the doomsday symphony, and _PERSON_ piano sonata in B minor was the tragic fall of an individual. A 
lot of people do NOT like _PERSON_ piano sonata because of ""doom and gloom"" it is. It's arguably the darkest piece of classical music made before the post-modernist era. Either way, there are other pieces of music that can give this tone, most of which came in the Romantic era. _PERSON_ had a bunch of pieces like that. _PERSON_ had a lot of pieces like that too. He was the best modernist era composer in my opinion. _NAME_ - not to be confused with _PERSON_ - is a close second. Here's the _PERSON_ piece https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCHREyE5GzQ Here's _PERSON_ ""Tragic Overture"" because I feel like it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siYoz9CLA2c"

And I know I’ve gained weight and am not in shape like I used to be. So I’m trying to change that. I went for a long walk today with the dog. And I downloaded a couple apps to try to get me motivated. Even just a little bit should help me out. One is 30 Day Squat where you challenge to squat for 30 days. And the other is Burpees. As much as I hate burpees, they are awesome for cardiovascular health. I’m going to try them tomorrow. Squats will be easy, burpees will kick my ***.

175968199,"Ok so I know of 3 types of anxiety that I get.. 1. Mental anxiety (The worst because it causes a panic attack which causes physical anxiety. The only time I ever get ""anxiety"" is from panic attacks). 2. Physical anxiety (Second worst. I get this when speaking in front of a large group of people but I don't get mental anxiety when it happens. It actually feels kind of good like a rush.) 3. Stress (I don't even notice this. But it's always there). I'm constantly stressed. Stress is the main cause of diseases (Any disease). I can never relax. Marijuana doesn't help. Benzos make me feel numb and dull. I only use them for mental anxiety (Panic attacks). Opioids don't work on me and I don't like the feeling. Exercise and phenibut helps lift my mood. Meditation and stimulants seem to be the only thing that calms me down. I'm able to meditate better on stimulants because I don't crave dopamine. It's like the feeling of killing hunger but for thoughts."

I graduated dead last in my class, and in order to graduate, I had to do what everyone else did, which was show up in a costume with a parent and give a speech. So my mom and I go as something. She hid under my shirt and I had coco puffs for teeth. I got my diploma, and it said ""hard ass"" on it, so I got up in front of everyone at the top of the escalator, and I said, ""it's important not to give a [expletive]"" and that was my speech. Then I faked being in a coma for ten years, but instead of being in a hospital, I was in the middle of a shopping plaza the whole time. I'd get up and run around when it was closed. I nearly got caught once, but everyone was more interested in _NAME_ who was there to tell off some guy giving a presentation.

175968226,I just got my Invega injection today. I talked to the pharmacist that was giving me the injection for 10 or so minutes.. I told him that I didn't want to take Remeron with olanzepine because it can increase the QTc interval. He says that it's a serotonin thing and very rare to die from that unless I have something wrong with my heart.. But I think my serotonin receptors are sensitive from taking psychedelics (Which is why SSRI's gave me derealization/depersonalization dissociative psychedelic flashbacks).. I asked him about taking zopiclone 2-3x a week when I need to get up for work or skiing/hiking in the morning and he said that it can last 12 hours. I asked for something like zopiclone but shorter acting and he said zolpidem (Ambien). So I could ask the doctor about these two Z-drugs on Monday. I just need to be able to be on the right meds for 1.5-2 years so I can be stable and work on myself and then I can start lowering and stopping medications (Like Atenolol for example - I don't check my pul

A typical individual who is managing stressors well, will probably have a baseline that is below 5/10 ^ Such as: 2/10 or 3/10 or 4/10 Those with trauma as well as those who lack skills or those who experience other struggles (including chronic stressors) usually have baselines higher than 5/10 ^ Such As: 6/10 or 7/10 or 8/10 If you imagine that number increasing everytime a stressor occurs without having ways to bring them down, it will take what looks like almost nothing to set them off (bring them to 10/10) because they're already naturally so close to 10/10 most of the time anyways"

175968243,"Hello, I used to feel anxiety all the time when I first got out of the hospital. It was pretty frustrating because I didn’t understand why I was feeling so much anxiety. I would feel anxiety in public places, and I wasn’t able to heal and overcome my anxiety until I got to the root of it. The source of my anxiety was from a trauma that occurred. I hadn’t had to confront the trauma until I got out of the Hospital because I was protected and secure in the Hospital, but in the real world you feel less secure and protected. This is because everyday life can be tough and sometimes feel overwhelming."

(Didn't really notice a difference between the 2 and the 3 mg). Then some anti-anxiety medication Xanax .5 mg as needed, migraine meds, statin meds, sleep med generic Lunesta which doesn't work well anyway. When I was at the hospital, I was off of my meds for three days and the only one I really missed was the Vyvanse. I don't think the other ones are making much difference.

175968263,"It’s not a bad thing. Not to me. It’s the way it’s perceived in society. And my family on my moms side are, well, kinda wealthy, and they have said things to me before about all kinds of things. It always come from this specific aunt. She wasn’t even focus on what I was telling her anyway. She moved right to the money issue, which in my family is a no no topic BECAUSE of the fact that so many of us make a lot and in wealthy families u don’t talk about how much u make. It’s seen as low class. So, both the issue of asking me financial related stuff plus she didn’t even say anything about what I was doing. That was the only question she asked."

175968266,"I remember.. I was 17-18 years old.. And I was on Roll Call - Schizophrenia/psychosis on my phone.. I think it was an iPhone 4S or something.. I was not in a good state. I talked to no one for months. The wifi was ****** so I got to play a few songs on YouTube occasionally - I was listening to ""Rehab"" a lesser known artist. I just remember feeling so good cuz I woke up after taking 1-2mg of risperidone and ate like 8 slices of bread with spaghetti sauce.. I probably needed to gain weight anyways but I never felt so euphoric to just eat something.. I may have been on methylphenidate. I was on 5mg of Abilify or 10mg - I don't remember. But I remember phoning my psychiatrists office cuz I wanted to increase the dose. It helped with anhedonia but not for long after. I remember being so alone with zero responsibility or insight from anyone to help me know that I was actually a person and not just intuitive energy or w/e.. I was then brought to the hospital after eating 92 kpins. Rehab - Kept On Walkin

T is so good. We'll talk more at my next session. Lately I've been feeling something telling me to harm myself. It's hard not to listen to it.
175968275,I went a couple towns over to walk in their huge park. We have a park but it's tiny in comparison. I was the only one there and it was so peaceful.
175968276,There were things I wanted to post about but now I can't remember. Oh! Chocolate and drugs! Yes I have m&ms but my drugs are wanting sharply. I only have maybe 3 or 4 pills left of tiz and Ativan. So I have to conserve them although they'd help a lot right now. I don't think they're ever going to allow visitors here again. There were only about 6 cases here and only 1 death. That's amazing for a nursing home in this state. One of the important things about taking a pill is whether there's enough time for it to kick in. I have two extra bottles of Ativan at home but I don't know where they went. I must find them.

175968278,"_NAME_, i def agree with you. I agree that some medications can work quickly for others! The last time I was on lexapro I felt better within the first 24 hours! And lasted for about 3 weeks then felt the anxiety creep in but yet I was also getting close to my cycle and I was going through a separation. Eventually it subsided. I’m praying and and hoping it works immediately for me like last time. I love lexapro, it’s always been the med for me. But I do get extremely nervous starting each time. It’s interesting that you get side affects within months, so when you start the med you don’t get the side effects then? And I have not done mediation, I wouldn’t even know how or what to do. It would def be something I’d be willing to try. Any tips would be greatly appreciated ?"

175968284,"Hi dear friends, and yes long text inc. <3 It's been ages since I last posted on forums and I hope that you all are doing good. I had a chance to chit chat with Scaredy Cat quite a while ago but never had a chance to post a detailed update here. Have been quite stressed after I separated from my husband and moved out as I need to find job and stressed financially. Hopefully things will be getting better and I will be working. A bit on the positive side I am not as much effected by the regular health anxiety as I used to, but of course some of the things are still bothering me occasionally. I stopped sertraline around 8-9 months ago and actually don't plan to use it again. And not getting panic attacks anymore so. I guess the coping of anxiety issues resulted from me being left all alone (for the ones who don't know I live in a different country than my homeland), though I am still good friends with my ex and I have to pester him with my worries sometimes xD. But when you struggle alone I guess copi
ng becomes easier. I have increased amount of IBS now, which makes me fall in to the worry pit. I am just assuming i have IBS because my mom has had it all her life. My symptoms are not changing, my typical left sided spasm back pain which doesn't calm down before 15-17 hrs. And typical burbling gas/bloating. This is a type of pain I've been experiencing for 4-5 years now nothing new. But it used to happen every 3 months or so, occasionally happens again after 2 weeks but rarely. Now it feels like it's happening every week this month. I cut out artificial sugars and carbohydrates for quite a while now and lost some extra weight, which I intended to, but I think the times I have this pain I also remember eating something processed like chocolate or some junk. I am just wondering if I really should bother myself with this issue. Today I ate a big chocolate bar and now I am rolling in my bed >.> I just want to courage you all who suffer panic/health anxiety and say that these are very much managable. Just dont g
ive up and stay cool cats. Hoping to say hello more often , cheers."

Maybe I'll brush up here and there throughout the week if I can summon the energy, but geez _NAME_, it drains me. I sit on the couch and just stare blankly ahead for hours afterwards because im so tired. Good new, my 3 new bookshelves come in Wednesday. I might have to order a 4th because I have so many books. My room is just piles of books right now. I can't wait to organize them chronologically again, it's like organizing my mind, seriously. I think I will get a 4th one, the shelves are just $70 each. I've been grappling with german romanticism and idealism lately, and I understand kant very well--it all starts with him, but after that I'm proving oblivious, and I'm getting lost quickly. I was stuck on the phrase, ""The primacy of Being"" for a good 20 minutes, while messaging 12AM's husband, he wasn't around but I 
was still messaging him, figuring it out in real time. Sometimes that's the best way to actively engage with an idea."

175968291,"See above (page 1 or 3 the looong yellow cite): "" There may be great difficulty differentiating individuals with Schizoid Personality Disorder from those with milder forms of Autistic Disorder and from those with Asperger's Disorder. Milder forms of Autistic Disorder and Asperger's Disorder are differentiated by more severely impaired social interaction and stereotyped behaviours and interests. "" That means, esp. if you have stereotyped interests that'd be a good indication. Whatever this means in practice, train spotting maybe or ordering the cutlery drawer every day, don't know. But it needs to be repetitive and always the same (masturbation excluded I guess . And the more severely impaired interaction reminds me of that I heard that Asperger people will not lie. Afaik Schizoid people also lie less (than e.g. AsPD (depending on the circumstance), NPD, HPD who are one big walking lie), but I'd guess (wo being a specialist) that _PERSON_ would not even lie to be polite, or less. However, I also r
ead from a famous (in my country) scientific book from a professor that Schizoid personality disorder is hard to differentiate and needs to be done by a specialist. I guess it'd be worth the money."

175968299,"It’s good that you are reaching out seeking help, and are interested in improving her situation. She has a lot of things going for her, one of them is you. It sounds like she’s been diagnosed (bipolar) and has the medicine for that. If she will just take the medicine she already has. Do you know what medicine she has? As a bipolar myself, I take anti-depressant Mirtazapine and then Lithium which keeps the anti-depressant from throwing me into mania. What does she take? As for the symptoms for mania, to see if this sounds like what she might have, as noted by >medicalnewstoday.com<: *Higher energy (some people with mania may move from one activity to the next with many ideas of things that they want to do, often starting a variety of projects and not finishing them) *Feeling overly exhilarated (or extremely irritable) Inflated self-esteem *Racing thoughts (may include rapidly changing ideas and an inability to concentrate on one thing) *Pressured speech (tendency to talk very quickly and loudly. 
It often goes hand in hand with racing thoughts) Sleep difficulties (stay awake for more than 24 hours or only sleep 3 hours a night, yet report feeling as though they have slept well) Engaging in risky behaviors Does she show that in addition to depression? You need to know this so she can get on the right medicine. Is this her typical behavior? As far as not being able to afford medical help, there are free mental health and drug clinics around. You pay on a sliding scale, and pay only what you can afford, all the way down to free. You can look on your computer, type into the search engine, “mental health clinics in my hometown”. Write down the info and call one of them about an appointment. She can tell them she wants a female counselor if that's what she wants. As for what to do when she has an outburst, I use to have a Beagle dog who almost knocked herself out one night by sniffing under the front door and knocking loose a security pipe that attached over her head to underneath the door handle, and r
eached down to the floor. She inadvertently knocked the pipe loose from where it was lightly attached to the floor, and it fell on her head and she thought someone was beating her to death. She started running in circles, jumping up on my bed for a second or two, and then continuing her path, yelping loudly all the while. Whenever she got to the bed, I would tell her, “I love you.” I never tried to hold her down. I would advise not trying to hold you wife, but merely telling her you love her when she is having such an episode. I would consider such verbal support, getting closer to her if that was accepted, if so, lightly touching her and then maybe lightly holding her. I would be careful about physical restraint. Say supporting things like, ""I'm working on getting you some help."" You said she had “so many co-morbid conditions - PTSD, sexual assault from the past, anxiety, agoraphobia, seizures, etc.” So, that kinda explains what’s going on. So, what it sound like she is doing is taking out her an
ger out on herself, when it was others who mistreated her. Some people take the anger out on others by harming them. Neither one is really good. But at least you know what is going on. You said she “self medicates with marijuana consistently, and that helps most of the time, - that Marijuana isn't enough sometimes.” She may not be on the right medicine, she may not have been diagnosed right. If she was on the right medicine, she might not feel the need to self-medicate. If she was balanced, that would be a big help. That’s why we need to get her to a medical clinic. That’s why you need to determine if she’s bipolar by looking at those symptoms. Does she tell you about the trauma things? Also, what were her parents about ? One thing, were they negative? I use to have negative unconscious thinking and it really tripped me up. I probably learned that from my negative parents, and maybe from being bipolar, maybe both. But the form of positive thinking that I happened upon was to think positive going int
o the problem, thinking that I could solve it, even before I started trying. That put my brain on positive, looking for solutions, not on my unconscious automatic negative looking for failure as I was taught as a child. At the top of this bipolar forum are resources about dealing with illnesses, which includes a part about being positive as one portion of working on an illness. I would suggest you look at that. I think it’s good that you are trying to help her."
175968300,"I was talking to fiancé/hubby. I feel like desox. Me: babe are u gonna get up? Him: ugh can I never sleep in? Me: you can but you complain about being sleepy in the morning but you stay up til 2 or 3am. You’re not a machine. You can’t run on little sleep. Me:... Me: I’m the machine in this relationship anyway. I run on 30% oil aka vape juice, 30% water, 30% AI fragmentation and 10% silicone nutrition aka ramen. I was born a robot in the midst of a fascist regime and I awake a human in this new administration. Him: k *sleeps* *snores* Lmao idk what’s wrong with me sometimes. Every once and awhile things like that come out of my mouth."
175968301,"In my experience, some of the personality disordered lie to everyone, possibly more so to those closest to them, because they lie first to themselves. And, in general, we cannot help but fall short of the truth, whether due to deceitfulness or ignorance, because we cannot be omniscient. The truth is hard to get at. The going is tough and the language used to get there must be unambiguous and clear. Pure mathematics is the closest we come to it. As pathetic and laughable as it is, believe it or not, we are all doing the best we know how to, and we will all experience the cumulative effects of our actions, good and ill. I thought that that politically-correct, manipulative creep who tried to take over my job was ""totally jazzed"" with his smarmy life. A few months later, his family was discussing ""pulling the plug"" after he blew out his internal organs chugging antifreeze. And I'm not lying at. all. when I say I'll be retelling that story for a long time to come. We really can't tell how others fe

175968305,"I have so much going on. So many projects and different stuff. And seems like a few things are definitely coming to fruition, fast. I couldn’t even begin to list everything I’m doing right now. Just a cascade of projects. Dozens of projects. Some I haven’t had time to start in between doing things in my personal life. I’ve also got a backlog of books and games. So no more of those for me unless there’s a book I need for my writing career. I’m working on completing like 3 different major games right now too. _NAME_, Pokémon expansion pass, and some other one. Oh dang, I can easily think of a few more. All RPGs. And gotta figure out something to do about the house. I mean we kinda have it figure out but I need to work with this dealer on the final number and down payment if needed. Plus the loan type etc. We will see. _PERSON_ opened up to me and said it would be good for us to be on my dads land. He said the way I worry about my dad, that since my mom is going to the other side of Texas 
next year, that I should be closer to my dad. Plus more opportunities for work for us, less spending on gas cuz we goto his moms which is over an hour away (currently) regularly. Plus other expenses saved and loads more opportunities in the area. Plus my dad is not getting younger and I will be inheriting that land. It all only makes sense. It’s just about finding the most cost effective housing solution, short and long term, to be there on his land. I’m gonna be working on my book tomorrow and putting it up. It actually might not be for sale right tomorrow with all the channels I have to ping, aka go through, to put it up for sale. My bills will also be paid tomorrow too. My unemployment has run out. Thank god if I can secure this job, this might’ve been where I need to be work wise. It seems to be working out so far. WorKing at home, plus probably would’ve overwhelmed me to write as a job as well as for my career. Technology is my other lover, so itll give me a break from writing. And I seem to be g
ood at helping people tech-wise. Yikes. I could go on. But I’ll spare current details until some of these projects go through. Which I haven’t even mentioned any of them here. Yep! I’m doing all of this, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I’m keeping busy."
175968306,Went well with the doctor today. Good to see him in person. Though… He seems tired. Poor guy. Having to wear all that PPE just to see patients. He told me he hates the face shield. He checked me out and I’m healthy but overweight and need to work on getting more active. Suggested I get to doing more long walks and stuff. Any exercise would be great but cardio is important. So I need to work exercise back into my routine. I’m sad it fell out of it. And eat better. Trying intermittent fasting and cutting out (most) unhealthy snacks. I can’t completely give things up that’s not good for long term success and just need to eat better. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

Have you tried the long-term medicines? I've tried Sinaquan (tricyclic) anti-depressant and it worked for both depression and anxiety.

The 25th is an important anniversary for me. It is the first day last year of my hospitalization and the last day that I self harmed. So it will be my year anniversary. I want to do something nice for myself. Kind of hard because of Covid but maybe drive to the mountains and have a picnic or drive to the beach and walk across the sand. I don't know. I just want to do something nice for myself. And I don't want to be at work. I've been wanting to call out a lot lately and not wanting to come in so I know I am suffering some burnout. Usually when I feel this way if I take a day off I can ""reset"" and feel better. I hope that is the case here too. I hope my bos

I am very irritable, so I have been very short in my 'conversations' with other house-mates.

(Sorry for that run on. Oof) Here’s the thing though. Nothing says you have to stay even if she does get better. You are allowed to put yourself first. Perhaps this will just be the one last good act for her. You’re doing a good thing."

175968369,"zeze Welcome to Inspire............You say that you know it does not seem like a major problem.......oh yes it does! It effects our comfort with self. We have a strong and legitimate need to be satisfied with what we have accomplished on any given day. If we do not get that, then we walk through our life with the voice of a devil sitting on our shoulder, feeding us with negative thoughts and words as to our worth as a human being.....that is BIG !!!! YOU ALONE HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER THAT!! It is a matter of retraining your thought process. It goes like this: ""zeze you didn't do a good job of making the bed"". So then, you either stop and do a better job, or....you say to self ""maybe I didn't do my best job, but....I have several other things to do, so, given the amount of energy I had to donate to that job....I did it well enough and I will be satisfied""! It is a matter of retraining the thought process. That, of course, is not permission to do things in a half-assed fashion, but permission to 
do your best, AND BE HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS! Could that help?"

175968375,"IF the medical folks did a good checkup on you, then you were in the midst of a full blown panic attack. Once you have one, the terror of having it happen again can be really debilitating. I started having them years ago. I got to the point of not eating I was so nauseated from anxiety. Do reach out for help from a psychologist, or other therapist to work thru this. There are meds that can help. No shame, no embarassment is necessary. Sometimes runs in families. Don't take the risk of losing out on life w/ these feelings.

All I have managed to do is drink and sleep. Can barely move. He didn't mean to hurt me. He feels really bad. But I am hurt, can barely walk. This makes my depression and anxiety so much worse. What do I do?"
175968386,"I've experienced memory loss, HJ. In 2001, I decided to get ECT treatments, as psychiatric medications weren't helping me with my depression back then. As a result of the ECT treatments, I don't remember much from the latter part of 2000 and early 2001."
174359343,"So then, once this type of thinking transfers into emotions / distress overwhelming enough to constitute compulsive behaviors, it becomes a type of OCD? If so, then where is the line between what we're talking about and intrusive thoughts? Yes, when it interferes. Without going into detail, I'll say my experiences with ""odd beliefs"" can interfere. Not enough to stop me from functioning, but it sure as hell can slow things down and/or complicate very simple things. I've had the schizoaffective disorder dx more than once before, but I've also dropped it more than once. I haven't been considered SZA in approximately 2+ years (I'm bad with tracking time due to dissociative / partially dissociative states). Currently, they look at this part of me more in a way of who I am and coping mechanisms. When you say ""born out of experience and inappropriate interpretation,"" I'm assuming you mean? ^ Which I think you're saying is not the same thing as schizotypal ""odd belief"" thinking. ^ But since the DSM i
s only really interested in labeling, what if that was to be the actual cause of it? And if not, then what? This is particularly interesting. I'm not sure if I'm talking along the same lines, but there are times (or phases in my my life - I shift a lot) where I have to put effort into being understood. I make sense and am not unintelligent, but I can be quite creative in how I say things. Sometimes it's almost a metaphorical paraphrasing. If I'm to explain my thought processes behind what I say and tie everything together, I don't actually have ""disorganized speech."" I'm not as random as I sometimes appear (other times I am for fun/play) and I don't actually do ""word salad."" I'm wondering if this means leaving out information or framing what you say differently than how you see things to avoid _USER_ID_ / labels / judgment / confusion / having to explain (almost like I'm asking you to do right now ) ....? Also interesting. Sometimes I feel emotional connection / rapport enters me into a contract of agreem
ent or forced alliance with people which can lead to denying my authenticity and desire to do what I want mainly because I'm quite opinionated and don't see things the way a lot of the people I'm around do, but I'm pretty sure this isn't what you mean. The other option being no emotional connection = no lasting value? I might have to look for that blog."
175968387,kinda depressed

175968391,"I bought this really interesting book by _PERSON_ called ""_PERSON_ The Hound and Other Stories."" _PERSON_ is a Japanese artist who makes illustrated versions of many of _PERSON_ works. The art is incredible and so realistic looking. It makes visualizing all of _PERSON_ stories so awesome! Don't get me wrong, though. This is not a children's novel by any means. And it is not manga/anime despite him being a Japanese artist -- although it is in black & white (but I think you get a more dramatic effect that way)."

Don’t let diet and exercise drive you crazy it’s not worth it.
174359379,"So, I am _NAME_ and I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. I was already diagnosed as bipolar type I, but my psychiatrist bumped it to schizoaffective, bipolar type yesterday. I've been battling with psychosis since adolescence and I have been hospitalized quite a few times. However, since I never worked below my level of intellectual capacity, they never said I'm schizophrenic. Some of my diagnoses are depression with psychotic features, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and now schizoaffective disorder. I work, but I am going to be fired sooner rather than later. I had a psychotic break two years ago and I wanted to skip work for a bit, and now they won't allow me to come back. I probably will qualify for disability. I am married, no kids. I live in the Netherlands. Just wanted to say Hi!"

175968412,"In my personal experience, people who really know their stuff present complex information simply, to make it understandable by everyone. Truly smart people have been humbled by regularly confronting hard problems. They have quiet confidence and are not intellectually insecure. They do not need to ""sound smart"" or appear superior. In contrast, when someone wants to look more knowledgeable than they are, especially when they fear being challenged, they often hide their lack of meaning behind fancy words. They immediately throw ""boring science""--numbers, charts and graphs--at people, knowing full well that most are unaccustomed to analyzing data and experimental designs and will not question such things. When a presenter truly wants to be understood, they use simple, clear language and concrete examples. As far as possible, they avoid numerical and graphical abstraction. Professor _PERSON_ is presenting his information in simple language even a child could understand. He aims to clarify confusion 
and reduce panic. He knows that the true danger lies in our governments' and our own reactions to the invisible Specter of Fear released by the irresponsible, uninformed declaration of COVID-19, in and of itself, as a potentially disastrous pandemic. Paranoia? Got a cough? MUST be COVID-19!!! Empty hospitals: https://needtoknow.news/2020/04/people- ... ency-rooms How am I so sure that this is an exercise in control by The Man? Were this virus truly _PERSON_ ""Red Death"", let's say, Ebola, regular citizens wouldn't find out from the MSM. We'd find out when our relatives and friends started getting real sick, bleeding out and dying. I believe that we'd be kept deliberately uninformed, ""to avoid general panic"", and make it easier for the rich and powerful to silently escape to their fortified, well-stocked safe houses in undisclosed locations. To the rich and powerful, we are an audience, a tax base, a labor pool. Were this Ebola, even the rich and powerful would discard vanity in favor of survival. It would 
be everyone for themselves. We'd be looking for answers, and every elected official, CEO, dictator, member of the nobility, and all but the best doctors would be AWOL. Bet on it. I've long believed that society's ""genteel"" upper-crust, the nobility, the Boston Brahmin, etc., would be the dirtiest m-fs in a crisis, the first to resort to cannibalism."

175968415,"Lots of mental illness related games on Steam. If I had known back then that Steam was like this, I would’ve played years ago. But it’s better now than it’s ever been! There’s, so far, 33 games on there that are mental illness related. Some are like that meditation game. Some are visual novel games like this one called “One Small Fire At A Time” about a girl that has MDD, “Magic Deficiency Disorder”. She can’t do magic in a world filled with magic. So she’s in a mental hospital. There’s others that are Virtual Reality based. So you need like a headset to experience it.

175968446,"_PERSON_, I agree with all of the above. Blood pressure is designed to fluctuate throughout the day, with activity, stressors, ect. You may have been nervous during your screening or it could have been an inaccurate reading. In other words one reading doesn't give you the overall picture...and the average of reading throughout the day is the best indication of what your median BP actually is. So if you have a home monitor and you don't already track it, starting to do so could be a good plan. Or you could just tell your doctor of your recent experience. (and/or ask for a recheck) If he/she isn't worried about it neither should you be. Peace and progress! S.C."

174359472,"I was thinking about talking to that friend and it made me think back about things to disprove his hollow earth theory. I would have said things like earth is tilted.. spinning every 24 hours.. poles are wobbling.. magnetic poles are changing cuz it's cooling down slowly in the middle.. it's going a round the sun.. closer or farther away idk.. all i know is that it's closer in the summer and further away in the winter... the sun is travelling through the galaxy.. closer or further away to the centre idk... the galaxy is travelling to crash into another galaxy.. both going towards a great attractor.. universe is expanding.. universe possibly colliding with another universe... which could be black hole in galaxy of another universe.. which could be inside the brain of a penguin.. idk.. and inside stars, supernova happens after the pulsation of stars stops and more matter is obtained, they implode and create heavier atoms then bounce back and explode, all the matter fuses together in cold fusion to ma
ke meteors and then that creates planets.. hydrogen was the main thing as the universe after the big bang was all gas.. and hollow earth theory disproves the big bang.. Then I thought about colour particles.. red, yellow and blue ones.. making quarks etc.. and those could maybe be broken down who knows.. everything is made of colours and it was a very trippy conversation cuz we both tripped and were gonna trip together with 2 other friends.. And hallucinations? What about the particles in your brain that make the colours for hallucinations? What about schizophrenia and dreams and alcohol DT, psychedelics, all those things I've been interested in.. Then I find things about the optical nerve and the eye.. Then I stumbled upon the theory of everything which I've been ignoring for a while.. And all of that will keep me entertained for a while.."

175968466,"This is starting to get to me. Oceanfisher, first he won by treating y’all like dirt for 30 years. Then he won again when he needed a free house and companionship by conning his way into your house to live for the rest of his life. This guy is one tough hombre. If he offers to sell you a bridge, say no. Or, rather, no thank you. I thought I was the biggest sucker in the world. My son’s teenage girlfriend worked her way into our house by climbing in the window. The other two members of the family were on her side: Oh, she’s pregnant by our (worthless) son. Oh, she’s in bad with her mother so she had to get pregnant so she had get back into her mother’s house. We had a room built onto our house so there would be room for her. Mistake number two. Mistake number three was my deciding that I should take care of the baby while they are still in high school, even though I have sensitive ears to noise. He cried one day and I haven’t kept him or ridden in a car since. All of these mistakes were 
because of a negative frame of mind. Thinking of it all now with a positive frame of mind, here’s the deal. Instead of letting here stay here, I realize, she’s 16, she has parents who have a house, this is not her house. Tell her to go home. If she doesn’t go home, call the police. Tell the police, she’s a runaway, take her back to her house. So, the other two problems don’t exist because of solving the first one. So it was my negative thinking that got me into trouble, not my (worthless) son. Here’s a story for you. A man and woman treated their three young children so poorly, the courts took them away, and a nice woman who knew the children agreed to tale all three. Very rare. A week or two later, the same unlawful parents who treated their children bad, knocked on the woman’s door and asked her if they could take the kids to get ice cream. In adults, she’s outnumbered 2 to 1, and one of them is a male. She said OK. That’s the last she saw of them, and the younger girl was sexually abused. 
So, that’s the, when the enemy appears on the doorstep situation. One might could, see who’s there before they open the door, and then not open the door, or call through the door, “Yes, what do you want?” Three, if door is open, say, “Yes, let me get this right quick,” then shut the door, lock it and call the police. I think having a positive frame of mind for this and other problems would help. It would have in my case."

It's horrible. Then I start replaying bad memories surrounding his death and I'm just so tired of feeling so sad and putting up a good front at work and to my other kids. My husband is in bad shape and I'm trying to be supportive but I can't even take care of myself. Then I worry about him because my coping skills are better and I'm still struggling.

175968474,Nice to see you _NAME_. How have you been?
175968475,"Been awhile, been going through some other things that have been pretty traumatic. As for the issue me and _PERSON_ discussed, at least for me, it has remained the same. I noticed over time that while there, if I didn't focus on it and get upset about it, my mind slowly forgot. To the point that I may be seeing it but not really registering consciously per say. So I don't react. I can of course make myself see it, lighting conditions matter the most. Typically low lighting, or a bright source like a bright screen and moving my hand or objects over a dark desk or keyboard. So it's always there. I don't believe it has changed at all. I never have gotten an answer to this, or what causes it. But it's either an eye issue (unlikely), or a brain issue (likely). It probably is illusory palinopsia, idiopathic for me. No known cause, just appeared. It seems incredibly odd something can just ""appear"" one day for no apparent reason, but it did. I've tried to figure out the why, and have not ever been able t
o find a link between me and others. Outside say, stress. Which everyone has, and not everyone has this. I'm also near sighted, have a good amount of floaters and years ago did have periods of odd visual anomalies (not anymore) such as seeing certain lines and patterns wave and oscillate and such. Like everyone else, the doctors clear me for my eyes being fine, even with an in depth image retina scan. So, it's likely a brain issue. My biggest tip would be to not focus on it (easier said than done). My mind finally moved onto other issues I was having which helped separate myself from it. I don't react to it as badly anymore, and that has then in turn allowed my mind to not as easily pick up consciously that I'm seeing it."
175968476,Wow that is beautiful!
175968477,"Saw my sister play volleyball. If she didn't win the finals, she wouldn't be playing it anymore but she won! I had a little psychosis arguing with the Gods and felt like I was controlling the game based on my thoughts. But I think that is normal ""psychosis"". I wouldn't have had that before my psychedelic trips. In the game now, I'd be like ""The other team are catholic and mean so I wonder if they win does that mean that people that don't enjoy themselves get ahead in life?"" because my sisters team were laughing and having fun... ""Will one team that loses end up as heroin addicts?"" and ""My mom thinks she can control the game too.. Is that because she also did shrooms when she was my age? Are shrooms the cure for everything?"" and ""My sisters team knows my mom has breast cancer and my mom is cheering them on.."" cuz my mom, dad and I would switch sides of the audience to their side because my mom thinks she has powers and every side we went, my sisters team won on our side.. and I said to God
, ""If my sister wins, then God doesn't exist and I can finally get you out of my head"" but she won and it didn't work so.. And then I think, ""People call religious people stupid.. But I was smart and an atheist before psychedelics and now I'm a pantheist and still smart so it has nothing to do with anything.."" I believe complete skeptics are just as flawed as the complete opposite. There's God that exists which also doesn't exist at the same time, multiple gods and there's the devil which is also god but separate at the same time and multiple devils and good is bad and bad can be good. Am I insane? I don't think so! I packed all my stuff when I got home cuz I'm going to see my grandmother on my moms side. She is dying cuz of a heart problem and my uncle on my dads side wants to put everything of hers in his name and take the will. I packed 20g of phenibut in capsules to keep me somewhat happy and prevent feeling moody and depressed in front of my dad. My dad says that he thinks I'm doing VERY well and cal
m and focused like not zoning out or anything and he sees me as completely ""normal"" and not ""crazy"". He asked about you guys and I told him about _PERSON_ success and that some are struggling but still taking their meds =] I love my thoughts sometimes."

175968483,"As the title suggests would this now recognized abuse (UN) or act be perpetrated by clandestine sub-contractors as part of some non-ethical research into the abilities of what I think is EMF-based means, assaults upon unwitting hooked victims of seriously sadistic and broken down operators and their goals, as they are the same with any real VH or TI the tactics even though hidden due to the Target being isolated within their immediate environment or outcast statues. As most of us similarly have this background, of which again is very telling as the consciences are numerous and multiple with every case. The telling part of comparing it to what's known as Soft Warfare is striking. So, in light of a public's and governments flat denial of reality about this subject It bears thinking about, could underhanded finance seeking contractors perpetrator these hidden abuses to seal their income at the coast of the unwitting victim.

I know you have been concerned for a bit. Nipples are very sensitive, but if you are concerned, I would call the doctor or nurse and ask about it. Maybe a mammogram if you can get one at this time?

175968505,"Thanks for sharing these difficult experiences. I'm sorry there isn't much I can offer with regard to them. (Perhaps other PC members will have some suggestions they can offer.) It does sound as though you've been seen by a number of different providers including a couple of different hospitals & someone you referred to as your ""APN"". (I'm sorry I don't know what that is... perhaps a psychiatric nurse practitioner?) I don't know if you have a psychiatrist you see regularly. But what occurs to me, with regard to what you wrote, is that perhaps what might be helpful would be if you could arrange to be seen consistently by one psychiatrist. I know, in my own case, every time I have had occasion to be seen by a different psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, etc. each one always has wanted to do something different with me. And I think all of the changes that occur when that happens can really confuse a person's treatment. Plus just the changes in medications themselves can produce new & some
times disturbing side effects. (After a while one doesn't know what's causing what.) From my perspective, when it comes to mental health services, & psych med's in particular, there is something to be said for consistency. But then that's just my personal, non-professional opinion based on my own experiences. I hope you are able to find a solution to all of these disturbing experiences."

175968514,"Hi there. Congrats on coming through all of your hurdles and challenges. I have a full-time job and prefer to be in solitude. This is how I cope - I know that I have to earn a living so from the time I step into my office space to the time I leave for lunch I ""act"" and function as I should at work. I do my job, I say hello, I do not talk about personal stuff, these re not my friends, these are my co-workers. I communicate with my boss, I communicate with people who speak to me, but I do not go out of my way to be ""more nice"" than I have to. I think very structured boundaries and rules for yourself will help. I also remember that my work does not define who I am as a person. I do my best and I leave it there when it is time to go.

I have a 24 son who suffer from depression and ADHD who refuses to seek help because he doesn’t think he has a problem. So knowingly or u knowingly rather than seek help he is self medicating by drinking which makes it worse because then he become angry & just doesn’t care anymore. When he is in this state of mind I worry that when I wake I will find that he has taken his own life or worse his little sister will find him. As someone who doesn’t drink and have never drank, so i’ll be honest I don’t understand the need for it & find it hard to talk or deal with him when he is in this stage of mind.

174359590,"Hello _PERSON_: Thank you for bringing your concern here to PC. I noticed this is your first post. So... welcome to Psych Central. I'm not a mental health professional myself. (Most of us here on PC are not.) So I can't tell you whether or not what you are experiencing could be considered psychosis. However here's a link to an ""Ask the Therapist"" column, from Psych Central's archives, where the writer asked about LSD use & psychosis. Perhaps the therapist's response may be of some interest: Derealization/Depersonalization & Fear of Psychosis or Schizophrenia After LSD-Induced Panic Attack - Ask the Therapist I'm sorry there really is nothing I can offer personally with regard to your concern. My personal opinion though, for what it's worth, is that using any kind of mind-altering drug when one has a mental illness is simply asking for trouble (maybe even if one does not have a mental health diagnosis.) It can be difficult enough to deal with the impact of having a mental illness without throwing 
something like LSD into the mix. So my personal non-professional suggestion would be to check in with your mental health & / or medical care providers & stop throwing the LSD ""monkey wrench"" into the works. I hope you find PC to be of benefit."

I still struggle daily (particularly now as a therapist working remotely...ugh!) with loneliness, lack of nurture (although I'm a great nurturer) and and emptiness of gut and heart that I attribute to her abandonment plus the lack of other ""maternal"" figures to support, comfort, guide me. Love to you."

175968543,I don’t make a habit of weighing myself anymore but I weighed myself a couple weeks ago and weighed myself this morning and I’ve lost about 10 lbs so that’s pretty cool. I haven’t been going to the gym much lately and I haven’t changed my eating really so I’m think it must be from switching up meds. Pretty cool. If I tried a little more I could lose more but I don’t want to go crazy with it.
175968544,I'm usually emotionally ok cuz of the big trip.. Thats why I don't take an SSRI - So I can free myself to MethyleneDioxyMethylAmphetamine or shroom once they are legal.. I usually fast for 16 hours (Including sleep) and then after I take the stim.. I've been eating more lately - So the olanzepine is overpowering the stim.. I haven't exercised cuz it's so cold but might go skiing tomorrow - Then this summer I'll try to hike every day. I get enough social interaction from discord talking to people and here.. Some other places.. I was in bed and I couldn't bring myself to take the 30mg Vyvanse..

174359596,"You know you need something for bi-polar but you barely have energy just to get by during the day. I know how that feels. But you really need to start somewhere. Once you get on the proper medications you will feel a lot better. I know you are scared to try something new but you really do need to. I would look into therapy too. A good therapist can be like a new best friend. It really can lift your spirits. So I say let's get started. I take Pristiq, Lexapro, abilify and Xanax. I don't get a hangover from the Xanax. Maybe you could try a different benzo. Have you tried abilify for bi-polar? There are many others too. Newer medications. Have you asked the doctor for something for sleep? I use to take ambien and it helped me a lot. Often a half of a pill would work, and every other night instead of nightly. It might be something you would like to try. My husband takes melatonin. That is another option. I hope you take the steps to get better. It makes a huge difference when you get your meds straight

175968557,"I once read that some cultures have emotional states that others aren't aware of. A popular example is schadenfreude, which only recently grew in popularity as a way to feel good at someone else's misery. I bring these ideas up because it means that our interpretation of reality has a strong connection to the words we associate with our reality. One of the most classic examples deals with the fear/excitement interpretation. Things that usually arouse fear for most people (for example public speaking) can be interpreted as exciting. There's a boatload of examples of people doing scary things because they find it exciting (like jumping out of a perfectly good airplane). Now, I'm not telling you you haven't got a reason to feel anxiety about things which happened in the past. You feel what you feel and that's all there's to it. I'm saying, you don't have to interpret your fear as something you're powerless against. You don't even have to believe your fear means you ill will. It could be that you're af
raid of something because you're body is trying to alert you to something important. Your body doesn't use words to communicate, it uses feelings. Sometimes those feelings are a little overwhelming. Sometimes, they're so twisted up its hard to make sense of. Luckily, human beings have the ability to speak to one another. So other people are your best resource. People like me, might have words for the feelings you're having. Takeaway ==> talk more and keep working at it"

I know that scientists world wide are working hard and finding a vaccine but in the meantime we all need to stick to the restriction that have been put in place by governments around the world and only go out for essentials such as food and medicines and when you do go out adhere to social distancing which is staying at least 2m apart from anybody else you encounter when you are out. Stay safe folks we will get through this use your coping skills to help with increased anxiety. _PERSON_
175968573,Hi I don't think that changing the time of your Zoloft by a couple of hours will have caused you stomach upset but I may be wrong on that so check with your doctor.

175968583,"Thank you, survivor. I got that from this: “Poetry being imaginative, fresh and honest, is the very language of children, and many of their incidental remarks are simply love poems. Once, when I was in the living room with a guest, my little girl sat real close to me and said, `Will you look at me, too, some of the times, and smile and speak to me?’ This is one version of a child’s eternal love poem to the world.” _NAME_ in Speak to the Earth. _PERSON_; Readers Digest, July 1983.

His other friend is having twins soon and they have kids already. His best mate has 3 kids and is settling down with his, pretty much, wife. Even tho they aren’t married. He’s getting older.

Dark chocolate can help ease the panic attacks for me, so I keep it on hand. Also, for anxiety, broccoli helps me. It is supposed to help absorb the excess adrenaline in the stomach that the body produces... reducing the anxiety. Is there anything in particular about them that you'd like to talk about?"

175968592,"Hugs When I had suffered ptsd I suffered many many panic attacks , sometimes more than once a day, they feel bad, really bad but I did not die and I knew that if my breathing became too difficult I would faint and start breathing freely again. My body would look after me. I would be fine. I was not in fact dying at all. And I never worried about people around me, I knew if something happened they would help me. And knowing I was going to be ok helped the attacks pass so much quicker. As I went through CBT for the ptsd the panic attacks stopped coming, still not sure what triggered them as the lag between the stress and the attack is about 30 minutes. Maybe there were many triggers. Besides proper diet helped me as well. I started drinking natural teas like chamomile or shilajit (here are interesting researches on both https://www.huffpost.com/entry/6-natural-tea-remedies-fo_b__PHONE_NO_ and https://purblack.com/moomiyo-extract-super-yogis/ ) My beliefs, that I would be ok, that I trusted my body, t
hat other people would help me, were foundational to recovering quickly. A large part of CBT and therapy is teaching people to trust they will be ok and to believe their rational mind."

175968605,"I'm not quite sure I understand what answer you're looking for. I thought the citadel was how you choose to react, your inner fortress against the outside world. Like a sort of meditative detachment. I'm not trying to be dense, I'm honestly a bit confused by the question. Are you asking how I see the world? Are you asking what I think about most? Are you asking about my fantasies and dreams? Are you asking what the mood is inside? Are you asking me to imagine my mind metaphorically as a physical place and describe it? That reminds me of The Fall of the House of Usher. Some believe it's about the mind. I suppose I can relate to that a bit. Not that I remember anything particular about that story but it is Gothic literature and like most Gothic literature it reaches for the ""sublime"". How do I describe sublime... it means to take enjoyment of something in a visceral way. Seeing beauty in things that are imperfect and sometimes even frightening. Enjoying the details of life that perhaps aren't often 
looked at. Gothic Literature is about creating a detailed setting, a strong atmosphere, and a story that isn't very pretty. In that, I have no castle. I have a large old wooden house in the woods. The place would have crooked trees fighting for the sky. The night's would have a big yellow moon and the days would be covered in overcast. The animals would be mostly quiet and observatory, hanging around the house lazily and having been there forever. There would be an ugly chained dog watching every step you make and chickens scratching around in the dirt. There would be flighty, tweeting birds, cardinals and sparrows. If you listened closely, you'd hear the bugs rustling in the leaves, grass, and dirt. Not really a comforting noise, but not too unpleasant. Like the feeling of being watched but for just the briefest moment. The house would be old and well developed. Large but not so big as to called a mansion. Never threatening to crumble despite it's age and uncared for state. Perhaps it gets cleaned up sometim
es, Perhaps a few things get repaired. But the plants keep vining inside and the front door never closes. The walls are always faded or dirty, with hidden details waiting to be found underneath. It would feel like an adventure and an identity all of it's own. Walking through the house and being filled up with it's presence. And at night unseen creatures would scream in the forest, their noises growing closer until your eyes leak and your bones shake. The trees shivering as the screams grow louder. The bushes begin to rattle far too close and you unfocus your eyes too afraid to see the reflective eyes shining wide and sinister, looking at you."
175968606,"I just took the Enneagram personality test. I'm type 4, the individualist. And read this: I actually did that when I got really sick. I deleted my fb, insta, youtube, and some other social media I had."
175968607,I think pantheism is an understanding of the universe like many people don't get. That everything exists in some other dimension and that there's infinite dimensions. God doesn't notice or it can. It really doesn't matter - Just what you make of it. I was listening to my mom talk on the phone and was ignoring my cat. My cat doesn't understand that. Maybe it did. But what if you run a stop sign while driving and you passed and it didn't notice it since a cop didn't see you? The stop sign could have been watching a movie or watching porn and didn't notice you. How do I not get psychosis while being a pantheist? Idk. Psychedelics teach me this and to truly know is to scramble the brain in a very good way. Life is supposed to be a mystery.
175968608,"I think it depends on what the 'big risk' is. Sometimes people get so trap in their comfort zone that they close themselves off to new ideas or situations that might be a positive factor in their emotional development or health. Maybe it's not so much as taking a risk, but more of expanding your comfort zone."

Sigh. It’s hard. I mean...I could technically use like an app to pre-write and then schedule my posts automatically, but idk I don’t wanna do that. So then since I don’t, it cuts into all the free time I have. I spend every waking hour making content. Plus working on the SEO of a website is so beyond hard and can be confusing.

I agree with all. Sometimes I study Buddhism and listen to _NAME_ (A spiritual entertainer that would interpret and popularize Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism for audiences). I also agree with all religions because I think anything is possible and also think that they're all wrong at the same time so I'm an omnist. Then there's also all the things I research about shamanism in anthropology and psychedelics - But I also like scientific ways of looking at things, materialism, different philosophies. I was put off by Christianity when I was a kid because I always had to kneel and stand up then sit down in church and everyone was doing it with me.. It scared me and annoyed me - 
Having to pray 10 times a day.. And I saw a jehovas witness that was my friend.. He would stand outside the circle while everyone was praying. It was all surreal to me. I feel better off just learning to do everything myself because I know deep down that I'm a good person - Doesn't mean I'm perfect - I also like ""sin"" and find humour in the devil - Doesn't mean I'll ever be a satanist. I could try going back into practicing Buddhism for now.. As I said, there's so much stuff that I do. Buddhism could help with that - That's why I wanted to practice spirituality and was meditating yesterday. A lot of people don't like the word ""God"" and other do. It makes sense to believe in God.. But I feel like he tortures me. I don't exactly know what God is.. Because it's life to me. I feel like I'm easily influenced and manipulated, don't trust my own thoughts and don't think for myself.. I just chose neutral. I'm neutral in everything. I don't want to do things that other people do or be like others. I want to be my

I pulled a no call no show on Friday, I can guess why, I haven't worked in a month and I haven't been feeling well emotionally, but I don't truly know, because I made it Saturday. I don't always have energy. I work too fast sometimes and not fast enough other times. I did okay with a reliable schedule and easy work. The only trouble with that job was it was a work study job that doesn't exist outside academia. I'd have to continue to take harder and harder classes, until I got a master's degree to keep that one. Part of why I qualified for disability was how crappy I was doing at a work study job and now I seem to be struggling at a retail job, so that confirms it. I feel bad having them employ me, but I wanted to try one last time and I didn't have disability yet when I got the job.

Every breath we take is by the grace of God. I'm sorry to say this, but sometimes God has a reason why things happen the way they do. Cherish your life more because we only have this one life to live. It has been a month since I lost my little brother. I was very close to him. The day he died, he called me but i disconnected the call. I promised to call him back during my break but I never did. That call has been haunting me. Just last week I was diagnosed with high blood pressure and pneumonia. I can't sleep at night because every time I close my eyes, I get panic attacks. I thank God because today the Doc confirmed my blood pressure has stabilized. Last week I almost got fired from work because I had requested 10 days off to deal with my illness. The company is more concerned with the business than my health. Right now I'm still waiting feedback from t
hem. By faith, I will report to work on Monday. What am trying to say, is that I understand the feeling of worthlessness, I have been there myself. Apart from _PERSON_, I also lost both my parents and big sister. One due to stroke and the two because of cancer. Just believe you are worth it. Try to look for other positions online.

175968649,"Well, I was originally diagnosed with depression, then psychotic depression. I was depressed for a long time, and then hyper and little need for sleep. I thought I was bipolar but my old doctor didn't think so. My psychosis started a while after my dad died, I think. I'm fuzzy on timelines. I guess that kind of triggered it, but I was already up and down for a while. I was on risperidone and I hated it. It kind of helped but made me out of it. One day I thought it was poison and stopped taking it and then eventually my psychosis went away until a couple years later when it came back. Then I was out of touch for like two years until I started coming out of it and got diagnosed bipolar and a psychotic disorder. Trip down memory lane! Here we are now! Now I don't know if the psychotic disorder is still valid. Maybe I'm just bipolar 1 and had an extended episode? I don't know. It's hard to understand. I hope I see the psychatrist soon to help answer my questions. I'm getting tired of up and down and fe

You see, he gave those writings to all four of us, and I am the only one who has read it. He is discouraged himself. I feel awful that I hurt my dad. Like I said, neither of us meant to hurt the other. My daughter has been loving having me around so much. She makes me smile... I am so lucky. I can say, ""I am so lucky"" and mean it.

Everyone do things for selfish reasons. Even if it seems to be a selfless act... they're doing it to make them feel better about themselves. I don't know if I'm being manipulative or if I'm just expressing true feelings in my head when I'm saying I want to die. I do feel like I want to die... but then if I think about it... maybe it's not that I want to die... more so I don't want to feel this mental anguish anymore. I feel really bad right now. I feel like a horrible person. I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to feel at least sane. That's why the gods curse me with this. I can't express how heartbroken I am right now but I probably deserve it no matter how unfair I feel like it is.

But, Idk why I always place them in different places. I dont exactly mean to, and I do it every year.

They were gonna give me 27 dollars for it, even tho I paid like 55 dollars and it just came out. But then the guy said something and said he was going to be generous, and he gave me the full 55 back, but on a gamestop card. So I'm gonna give fiance that trade card as a gift card.

I don't have a firm idea of what I am best at and shall try to establish a better idea of those domains or traits. More recently I've fallen out of interest for pathology and negative traits as discussion on this board and psychology in general tends to focus on. Minmaxing requires more than just bringing the negatives closer to zero-- increasing the positives further away from zero too is important and I'm curious to see what kind of things I might find out by pursuing this for a while.

175968678,"I have suffered from mental illness for years. It all started when I was really young, probably 6 or 7, I had severe OCD. I had to touch everything twice, literally. If someone touched me on the back I had to touch them back, even if they walked in the opposite direction. I then began to avoid coming in contact with anybody, I avoided hugs, high fives etc. It was so bad. From there, I felt stuck for years, it was like my parents did not believe that I was suffering with something so bad. I was so young and I could not talk to anyone. Fast forward to high school, I was suffering from sever OCD and what I believe was a mix of anxiety and depression. I would sit in my room for hours, feeling overwhelmed with life. I started doing this thing where I always had to move my feet, I have no idea why. I felt like like my heart was racing 24-7 and that a million thoughts were racing through my head. I didn't really have many friends at the time, and I didn't know how to talk to my parents about this. I felt 
alone, completely alone. The only time that I really felt happy is when I was sleeping, even then it took me hours to fall asleep, and as soon as I woke up, the weight of everything was back on my chest. I honestly hated my life. Now, I am currently playing D1 soccer, I am happier. But I still have severe anxiety and OCD. I hide it from everyone and I don't think any of my friends or teammates no what I feel on a daily basis. It still feels like my heart is racing 24-7, I am always anxious about the littlest things. I always feel like I am not good enough for anybody, and it is really starting to weigh on me. I keep pushing all these feelings aside but I am done hiding them I really need to talk to someone.

Extremist Buddhism is also guilty of mass violence even though typically it's associated as being one of the peaceful religions. While we argue about religion you're missing what is beautiful in this world. The kindness of most people, the beauty of what's on this earth that humans a slowly destroying, and the animals that roam this earth trying to survive and living. Do the animals have religion? Are they capable of such thing? Where do animals go when they die? Where do humans go when they die? We will not know until 
we die. Is it comfort to believe in a religion that says the afterlife you're with your love ones once again after you or they die because the though of life after death is more comforting than say you turn into nothingness and you just become stardust in a infinite universe. There's the belief in the notion that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" ... doesn't stop at energy. surely we're more than just a a fatty meat inside our skulls with electricity that makes us feel like we have souls. Do we really have souls or is it a trick the brain plays on us while we're living? Who knows.

If I was truly SUI I would not have had a good affect or a good or maybe any responsiveness. I still can't believe three doctors thought I was sui even though I told each of them that I wasn't in a very calm and even tone. I wasn't upset or crying or anything. Ugh. Then the hospital itself, I didn't even have sheets on the bed for two days. Just a bare mattress, the two blankets that the ambulance crew had stolen from the first hospital, and a comforter that the staff kind of lobbed in my direction when I was going to bed when I first got there in the middle of the night. My pets have better bedding than that! Inhuman. Ugh. I was trying to talk to my parents on my lunch break from work about how I'm having t

175968715,I'm starting to get agoraphobic again. Like really bad. The only thing I've left the house for in the past week and a half is to take the trash out once
175968716,"Hi, I'm Rich aka Older Guy, Today plumbers are coming to work on pipes in the backyard. Like usually happens I am anxious. I am trying to remember they came last week twice and it worked out fine. My sister (who will be at work today) feels no such anxiety. I find myself comparing myself to her, and I come out on the short end of the stick. Part of the anxiety has to do with our dog. I hope he doesn't sit by the back door and bark for hours. I just have to wait and see how things work out. I have been up since 5:30 am (it's going on 8 right now) and spent quite a bit of time worrying. i should probably eat breakfast now because i'm hungry. i don't know if they will turn the water off, and when and for how long. i guess i could ask them, as well as ask them about how they will go about their work. i have texted a couple of friends to get their support. i guess i just need to breathe and trust that things will work out. i do know that if things go wrong, i will be able to take corrective action. feed
back encouraged. thanks for reading, Rich"
175968717,"Thanks, Sometimes."
175968718,"Im doing well, i have a lot of stuff to read but i have monday off due to memorial day. Work is busier than hell."
175968719,Christmas night of 2018 the spiritual Gods told me to order DMT so I did (': It was a beautiful night. Everyone was drinking and sharing love. Now I am in the compassion house for breast cancer with my mom so she isn't alone for Christmas. We're going for a walk today and then having Turkey dinner with everyone (Cancer patients and staff) <3
175968720,Glad you are getting over Covid. How frightening! Thanks for the reply concerning the Ativan. May I ask how many mugs you take? I am a ‘late bloomer’ to mental illness. I was ‘normal’ until I suffered trauma and then being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that will realistically shorten my life anyways.

175968724,_PERSON_ I understand. I just have had a bad string of therapists in the past 10 years. I open up to them and then they quit seeing me after a year. And not to mention most of them are not only not very good but they come from county clinics and they just try to diagnose you etc. I'm just tired of it. I think I won't see one for awhile. Texas is awful for mental health. Very awful.
175968725,"I haven't started watching it yet, but the TV series Chernobyl (2019) seems pretty interesting."
175968726,"Thanks _PERSON_! Yes, I was terrified of turning the oven on but I faced the fear despite that, now I can bake food when I want to instead of letting the fear control what I eat"
175968727,I want to create something.. =[
175968728,"Thanks Shoe. I didn't know the researchers carried out by _PERSON_, I will certainly look into it. "" Not too long after that I was driving down the road and listening to the radio. It happened to be Friday the 13th and the DJ said that some philosopher once said that superstitions where for people that are too stupid to figure things out for themselves or can't afford a psychiatrist."" - Looks like this is another synchronicity? You have been contemplating of the idea that ""I was being super superstitious."" and then you heard a DJ commenting on superstitions. These kind of things happened to me quite a lot. These experiences are mind-boggling, specially when you come across with it for the first time."
175968729,"My psychosis manifested as shamanism, I still sometimes practice it....."
175968730,My Dad just texted me and was like you want pizza tonight? Umm. Yeah!
175968731,"I remember my mom had a tenant that used to live with me and he stopped his lithium and started drinking. Did a cop chase, recked two cop cars and is now in jail. Not to scare you! But yeah anyways am feeling so tired.. I try.. I'm trying.. But so tired. Billions of Vyvanses can't help me.."
175968732,Christmas _PERSON_ 2019!
175968733,"I own it, because then stupid people don’t get it and then smart people know better."
175968734,Those are similar the the voices I've heard years ago.
175968735,"I had someone evaluating me once tell me if you hear voices inside your head that's intrusive thoughts, which are annoying but a lot of people get them, but if you literally hear them that's auditory hallucinations."
175968736,Yay bb’s on steammm
175968737,Just had a massive panic attack and hearing voices
175968738,"It's snowing, I love it. We're supposed to get 6 to 10 inches. I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow. And Wednesday. I have to do it in 2 trips because I carry the stuff on the bus. I did all my non food shopping online today. I'm feeling a little irritable. Like having thoughts of I hate myself, I'm disgusting, that kind of thing. Idk why. I have my period. Maybe that has something to do with it. I slept a lot today."
175968739,What are you planning on cooking?
175968740,Spice dragon tea.....
175968741,They have to watch their backs....you were saying you were psychotic even on this dose so there’s no way they’ll reduce it.
175968742,"Woke up early, it's going on 5. I like being up early, I'm a morning person"
175968743,"I want to go to my apartment and roll maybe 5 cigarettes and smoke them, and then roll some more. Really craving cigarettes right now. But of course they'd make me feel sick. My sinuses are clogged and I need _PERSON_ in my nose. There's a female smoker here who has terrible COPD. When she sits down from a small exertion she has her mouth open trying to inhale and exhale. That would be me after smoking for a.day or two. This is ridiculous. I just realized/remembered I have my little pods to vape under the covers later. I'd better never get caught. But it was a totally happy thought after the cigarette cravings."
175968744,She has plenty of extra clothes to put on if she gets too cold. She has like 8 or more cartons full of clothes. That is what I did in my last room. If it was too cold I put on a sweatshirt.
175968745,"Hi tigerlily3082, I tell my Psychiatrist things I wold never tell another mental health professional but we've known each other for 14 years or so. I used to work in the mental health field myself, and he knows this, so I'm always perfectly honest with him. He asked me last year if I had any thoughts of physical aggression against someone who was giving me a problem. I told him most definitely and in some detail. He asked me if I would promise not to do that, I told him yes and that was good enough for him. I never break a promise to him, not to mention I knew if I did assault him I would be going to jail, so I kept my promise and that was last year. They're right about not holding you unless they believe you're a danger to yourself or somebody else. Then it's only a 72 hour hold where I live before they bring you before a judge. If they state the belief you need to be held the judge will go with what they say and you will be held no matter what you say until they see fit to release you. My doctor 
knew me well enough to know I wasn't really a danger to this person. I was only unloading on him and telling him what I really thought. I asked for an increase of my Klonopin from .5mg BID to 1mg BID, but he said that would decrease my impulse control. He was wrong about that. I would be more relaxed and less likely to go off on him, but it was his call and I didn't debate the issue. He did, however, recently give me an increase to 1mg BID when coronavirus hit, and my legal actions against the person in question failed miserably. He didn't see impulse control as a factor then, but I'd had plenty of time to cool down since. So go figure. You just have to get to know your doctor and they need to get to know you to help you. They're not ""out to get you"" per se, and if you hold back from them too much it's not likely you'll establish any sense of trust in each other very soon. Of course, they may just be the wrong doctor for you and could need to find one that you feel more comfortable with. Never forget they w
ork for you. In any case, use discretion but don't be scared and good luck."
175968746,I was thinking maybe some noise cancelling headphones but I know the good ones are pretty pricey
175968747,It's ok - I've honestly been struggling with the same thing. Good for you!
175968748,Snuggling up with my plush seal and have some aromatherapy going on I sat outside for 10 minutes. I know that's not much but I haven't left my apartment in 4 days so it's an improvement
175968749,*WOW REACT* Try your best. Your soul is beautiful.
175968750,"Yeah, I got a notification today from the pharmacy via text that they're available and I was going there today anyway so I figured I'd just go ahead and get it"
175968751,Yeah I fluctuate between the reality and non reality aspect but it does something positive for me. It’s complicated but I believe and don’t believe at the same time.....idk even when I was pre psychosis my friend gave me some kind of energy healing and I swear it’s like getting a massage without ever being touched. Anyway your mileage may vary but I find that finding a compatible belief system can help provide like a structure for stuff that doesn’t fit neatly into boxes in the mainstream reality.
175968752,I feel manic like I felt before so I took more abilify. I’m throwing whatever I can at this because I need to focus and function.
175968753,"The other night i dreamed I went to thiland, but strangely the airport was surrounded by rocky ocean so we had to take something called an airbus which was like a flat bamboo square covered in hay, hanging below a helicopter."
175968754,"In 2017, June. I decided to decorate my bedroom and started with stripping the wallpaper(everything was fine no issues) then I started removing the old carpet, cutting it in squares to bag it up and take it to the trash but ever since I started cutting up the carpet and putting it in bags I started getting shortness of breath after the first two weeks, it was quite severe but then completely settled and ever since that moment from time to time, I get shortness of breath(like I can't catch my breath) but then it disappears and comes and goes 2018 was on and off and I'd go months without it then a few days in a month were I'd have a flare up and 2019 has been the same I haven't had it for long periods 6-8 months then a flare up before Christmas. I wonder what this could be?"
175968755,Never seen one.
175968756,Yay! They are reversible too!
174359876,I see my psych doctor today at 8:20 am. I saw my therapist on Monday. I don't think the Saphris is helping but then again I think the dead talk to me anyways and no amount of meds can stop it. The spirits tell me the future. They say I'm going to die soon. I tell people but they tell me I'm safe. I don't feel safe. I feel like I'm in danger. I don't want to commit suicide like the spirits tell me. I don't want to cut myself like the spirits and the demons tell me to. I'm scared that's all. People are telling me it's not real. It's real to me. I don't know what's real and what's in my head. I'm living in hell. I don't have to die... life is already hell. I just go to hell. They're abusive. I feel bad about myself. There's no relief. None. I'm not going back into the hospital. I refuse to go back to the hospital again where I'm isolated from friends and family. Where I can't do as I please when I please. I can't listen to the music I want. What I write here I show my therapist. She says if it gets bad 
to check myself into a hospital. I rather die before going back again so I'll do the best that I can at home.
175968757,Yeah she’s wearing his promise ring after having met him once and that’s the scariest part thy have some agents in this country....
175968758,Some people hate music lol
175968759,"This I've done for a long time. I don't have an issue with recognising the behaviour that is most beneficial and finding ways to cope with the confinement. It's just that a single restriction, even notional, is enough to make everything else seem like a compromise. Sometimes, all you want to do is watch the world burn."
175968760,Got off work late.
175968761,I’ve been trying to game more but I feel a bit sluggish here lately.
175968762,Taken all my meds for the day

175968764,"How's everyone feeling? I'm going to go to Chipotle after I finish playing with my book. _PERSON_, once I'm done, I'm going to do a giveaway for a day like you did. I wont be able to until the book updates with takes a day or three. I really messed up the delivery of my book when I first released it. :-/ I saw one of my professors in my ""friend suggestions list on facebook, which basically means he's spying on me since I've published my book. From what I remember, he's a pretty big tool. He assigned book after book, and article after article of whoch his professor published, so he doesn't have an original thought at all. His classes were a big disappoint me. I gave him constructive criticism once to tell the story, the history of science and biology but he took that as an insult and attacked me for it. My university's philosophy department is a wreck. I should have gone to UofM. :-/"
175968765,Yay bluebird!
175968766,"I have a noise machine next to my bed and often turn it to the ""Thunderstorm' option before going to sleep. It is soothing."
175968767,"there's something to that. i had a few close relatives with very emotionally draining disorders. i was also raised in a setting that needed conformity, or punishment and drama would be had. i adapted. although, i also think my differences stem from physical sensitivity too. lights, sounds, and touch."
175968768,Short-acting Adderall...

175968771,Dr. _PERSON_ aint your dr. Dr's order tests for many things..... I reckon if it was sonething your doc was concerned about you would have been told. Additional tests are sonetimes needded. Like for rheumatoid arthritis...basic test is RF and indicator but a more conclusive can be done. Keep ?. Any worries seek input from your doc and advise him or her of the consciousness. HT

174359886,I'm feeling sad tonight. My youngest sister A hasn't talked to me in months. We had an argument over _PERSON_ and Covid. She said horrible things. I tried to stay calm but I ended up saying something hurtful. I apologized. It was too late. My sister blocked me. She won't even respond to emails. I tried to patch things up. I sent her a Christmas gift over the weened. I had a really nice note attached. She still won't talk to me. I feel hurt that she isn't more understanding. I feel like she hates me. I know she blames me for something that happened 30 years ago. She threw it in my face back in March. But it was never my fault. It was not something I did or didn't do. In a way I am angry. She's emotionally immature. I guess I just have to let it go. There's nothing else I can do.
175968775,I used to have these really cool spider socks with webbing....
175968776,"I was wondering where she went, I miss my partner in random well-timed sarcasm!"
175968777,"Wouldn't second hand embarrassment be considered a form of empathy? I think I've felt it, but I can't think of any examples from real life. One of my oldest friends, whom I call Toe, is rather weird. Possibly undiagnosed schizotypal. I get mad at people who point and snicker at him when he gets unintentionally weird in public, but I'm not sure that would count as embarrassment because half of the time he's unaware of not only being laughed at, but of being weird as well. He's also the only person I can think of who will likely elicit a measure of emotion in me if he should drop dead. Why? He's ice cold, selfish and unemotional. I think it may have to do with the longevity of our friendship and some of the many things (good and bad) we went through together in the past. But I doubt I'd be sad for him because he's miserable anyway. I'd be sad for me because it would be like a large chunk of my life and history is gone. Just like when we feel a sudden pang of hatred for someone it usually boils down t
o what we see in them that reminds us of some aspect of ourselves we are either ashamed of or don't want to face. Maybe this is the same mechanism as second hand embarrassment at play here? I sometimes get embarrassed when people on TV make fools of themselves. Two examples would be someone being a complete idiot on a game show or a reporter screwing up royally or getting punched in the face on live TV. Neither of these examples makes sense because I can't stand television journalists or people who would purposely debase themselves by appearing on ""The Price Is Right"" . But then again, they do make sense because as I've said numerous times in the past, a well made movie or even a TV show can elicit emotions in me that I've never felt for anyone in real life. So I guess it has to do with being once-removed from the situation by it being artificial or otherwise safely remote."
175968778,I'm gonna stay up into the AM's tonight and try to wake up early. Must be the second coffee.
175968779,"I used to feel like that somewhat when I was on the Invega. but I've been doing a lot better with the vraylar and seroquel , oddly enough I've been doing even better with motivation when the seroquel was increased to 600. Kind of expected the opposite"

175968781,I might nap. Ugh I shouldn’t but I might. I feel lazy napping in the middle of the day.
175968782,"Hi guys. My therapist didn't call me last night like she said she would. She said she would call me at 630ish. It was 745 when I texted her and was like well I guess you forgot about me. It's okay, I'm going to bed. She texted me at like 9 but I was asleep. She said she was sorry, that she had to stay late at work. Today she texted me again and said she was sorry. She was dealing with someone who was suicidal and she almost had to hospitalize them. Yeah, but I was/am? feeling suicidal too. I told her it's okay that I'm a little better and we can just talk on Saturday. But she said she would call this afternoon. She wants to hear my voice. I feel like I didn't matter as much as the other client, although I know that feelings can be wrong. I feel like I'm a mess though. I want to talk to her but I don't want to talk to her. Maybe I'm a little mad that she didn't call. I don't know. She had a good reason. I'm being a stinker. I don't know how to feel. Life sucks."

175968791,Taxes are also extremely high there
175968792,"blue_bird I am right there with you. Bring on the cold, snow, ice the whole shabang!! I could do without summer finally this year i got Central Air for the house so besides having to take _NAME_ out a few times a day i can tolerate it locked away inside. I mean really the heat index yesterday was 107F and today 104F. But tomorrow its supposed to be 80F at least i can tolerate that. During last winter it went down to -40F, it thought that was rediculous but at least it wasn't 107F. I guess we had to have the extreme this summer to balance out last winter. Midwest Tams"
175968793,Same I do the exact same thing
175968794,"Feeling horribly sad and tired My mental health will deteriorate if my doctor teases me with the stimulant again. It's the only thing that helps me focus and withstand the sedation from the high dose antipsychotics. I tell you guys I plan all of these things to do - And the worldddd.. the ****ing worldd.. I just want to improve myself - I don't drink alcohol, smoke weed or cigarettes. I'm good. Waiting and waiting and every passing day is hell. I sleep too much as well. My mom has a bad cold. I worry about everything and everyone a lot. I want to give up. I really do. I wish I had a reason to give up and it would make life so much easier. Why did all of these bad things happen to me in severe isolation? Music is the only thing that helps and ever had. Not drugs. I had no one supporting me. It felt like I was in a dark black hole. I'm trying to live in the present moment, do meditation. The things I want to do in one day takes weeks or a month to do. At least I'm not having panic attacks. I want to 
feel emotions. I want to live life - Avoidance got me no where. I sit here like I always have and life goes on without me."
175968795,Had pizza and salad for dinner. It was good. I cooked the pizza just right.

175968798,"So you know I love school, but I’m not sure if you’re well enough at the moment.....last time you blew it off and that brings debt only. Now on the flip side, it might bring you out of this depression because you’ll have something to focus on...could you maybe take one class only?"
175968799,"I experienced trauma 3 years ago in addition to being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that causes severe inflammation. Without going into details, let’s just say that I did a few very uncharacteristic things that could have caused very severe problems. I am now left with the guilt and shame of those acts. That being said, I have been diagnosed with multiple illnesses....ocd (because I cannot stop thinking about what I did), anxiety, depression and ptsd. My latest doctor thinks I really suffer from bi polar 2 because of the two/three uncharacteristic things I did and the fact that now I am severely depressed and have been for over 2 years. One day I can function, one day I barely make it through the day. There have not been any further episodes of mania. He thinks I should change my entire course of action and take an anti psychotic versus the anti depressant that I am currently on. I am starting to think he is correct as the multiple anti depressants I have taken have done nothing for me. To 
think that I was misdiagnosed for all this time is very unsettling but I can only move forward. I am 63 and was ‘normal’ before the trauma. Any thoughts? Thanks."
175968800,"It was a birthday party and I thought the max I could have by feeling ""full"" from alcohol was 2-3 drinks so I had 2 and a half glasses of wine. Alcohol definitely is a trigger now that causes dissociation for me. I can't drink at all anymore. I've learned my lesson.."
175968801,"I have all these ideas running through my head. Well not really. Just stuff I thought up while in quarantine. I don’t really want to start on any of them. I have Barely been cleaning the house. The dishes pile up and they stay there for like a week. I usually clean them every 2 days. I haven’t showered in over a week now. I just, idk. And then fiancé doesn’t wanna wear his mask at work cuz he says he can’t breathe in it. It’s got a ventilation thing on it tho. So I’m at risk of getting sick and I have to goto my dads to wash my clothes... I may not can do that due to fiancé now. That stubborness of his is gonna end up killing both of us one day, for some reason. Depression and anxiety have been bad. But the psychosis lingers and gets worse at different points of the day. It’s been here since I got fired from my job. —————— I only have like 2 or 3 ideas anyway. Not a whole bunch."

175968805,Had homemade pozole today for lunch. YUMMY. One of my coworker's wives made it for us and brought it in. #spoiledlife
175968806,"I agree, there is always a reason and I’d imagine they are often very similar to the reason schizoids isolate themselves a lot are probably not aware of the true psychology of why they do it. Like seeing the world as a dangerous place or an anger for society because of an inability to connect with people in a normal way. For instance I’ve always been a loner possibly Schizoid or Schizoid like. I do have periods where I feel more social so I’m probably not a true Schizoid but the reason I do it is because at times I don’t like people, I just don’t want anything to do with anyone. Maintaining friendships seems like too much of a burden. I’d agree breaking off from social gatherings is abnormal in itself and is usually a pretty good sign that something is psychologically wrong with someone if it’s a long term pattern"
175968807,Still A History of Western Philosophy. And almost done with The Power of Habit. I need to dive into books more! Also reading You Can Heal Your Life by _NAME_. Also Harvard Business Review's 10 Must Reads on Mental Toughness. Also The _NAME_ Foster _NAME_ Reader. Ha. I need more discipline to finish all these books.
175968808,"I just don't feel like an emotionally supportive person on the internet. I used to help a lot of suicidal people online. A lot of people want love. But not many people love themselves. Self love is important. A lot of people hate what they don't understand like I imagine myself being in the city, listening to someone controversial on my phone and I imagine people yelling at me and then I say ""Have you ever had a psychedelic experience?"". Idk."
175968809,Pancakes and a mocha.....
175968810,"I have never experienced anything like that but that sounds horrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Not only did you experience abuse but it sounds like you also had to deal with many doctors just being bad at their jobs and not properly diagnosing you which is frustrating too. It is horrifying that they tried to ignore the fact that you were sexually abused and disappointing that they had no counselors to help you get through it. I can't imagine being in that center for 34 days; my sister was in a relatively good mental health facility for 14 days and I know she still hated it regardless. Hopefully, you can find a good therapist to help you now if you are open to it. Another thing you can do (it isn't much but maybe it would help you feel a little better while you look for more solutions) is give honest reviews of the places you stayed at on google reviews or yelp so that you can maybe warn others about the treatment you received there. I wonder if you could report them to the Better Busin
ess Bureau or something like that too."

175968813,"Oh man just ate a hand delivered apple fritter from dunkin, it was so good with coffee."
175968814,"Might bring my book with me when I go to the laundromat, it's pretty relaxing being there strangely enough"
175968815,Blues Brothers everybody needs somebody (to love)
175968816,I feel like I have a lot to say but I can’t get the words out. My sister made spaghetti and meatballs. Yum. Watching tv. I wish I had my prescription already. I want to feel better. I hate feeling this way. I know I know it’ll take time to work. Ugh. So done. I guess this isn’t full full mania because I’m still kind of sleeping and not completely out of touch of reality. But still it sucks. If I wasn’t on meds it probably wouldn’t be pretty.
175968817,"Other than that, he does this a lot. Attached Images 20200712_193529_HDR.jpg (215.1 KB, 9 views)"
175968818,It’s a take home though luckily. I mean open book....
175968819,I actually slept most of the night I went to bed at like 2 or 2:30am! That’s something cuz I usually don’t goto bed til about 8-9 or 10am!
175968820,I wish I could stay up late and read but my eyes are getting tired and I gotta work at 630am tomorrow. Boo.
174359948,I bought the paperback of your book btw.
175968821,Losing weight from cutting out most junk food
175968822,Best not to overdo _AT_MENTION_. Exercise is good but not if it is bringing out your _NAME_. HUGS!!! Kit
175968823,Well I woke up one hour later than last night...unfortunately once my sleep is disturbed it’s a real effort to get back on track.
175968824,"My face is frozen and I have a brain freeze from walking to the store and back. It's 9 degrees out , we have a winter storm warning. Drinking some nice hot coffee now"
175968825,"Downloaded ""Brave"" browser - It's an extended browser to Chrome. It blocks ads and is faster. I have everything all organized more. It's pretty neat."
175968826,I hope they are able to help.
175968827,"Congratulations on being alcohol free. It isn't easy. You are doing good. I agree with the mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness in general and meditation is what I do. I hope that it helps you. I would check out the resources. It can really keep you calm. Hugs, _NAME_..."
175968828,"I was hanging out with someone once when a mutual friend called. They chatted for a while and she tried to hand me the phone, ""Hey, it's so-and-so."" I very flatly said, ""I have nothing to say to her."" Which I meant in the most literal sense. I had nothing to talk to her about and no interest to come up with something. They were both mortified. I still haven't heard the end of it."
175968829,I'm thinking of trying the ten different types of nootropic mushrooms. I can't just only have a love for psilocybin ones..
175968830,About to have some pizza for lunch. We are having a pizza party at work.
175968831,pumpkin bread and banana bread are so good
175968832,"I don't see how you do it, my goal right now is 6K steps a day and I can barely do that."
175968833,I like _NAME_ but bluebird is our resident baking expert.....
175968834,I’m so sorry to hear Online therapy? Video chat maybe?
175968835,"I don’t really have any food in the house except lean cuisine which I don’t really want. I was supposed to goto the store today but I haven’t made it yet. I could walk up there it’s about a mile, but half the point of going to the store is rotating the car once a week. I even added the store to habitica but I’m fighting it for some reason. The main obstacle to overcome is going out to the car, I’m usually fine once I’m in the car. Still it’s already into a high traffic period, I could go tomorrow or I could walk and get some exercise."
175968836,I've been really bored lately. I need to find something to do. I did get that job I was talking about though. Maybe that will take up some of my time.
175968837,"The amount of cranberry you need to stop a uti is huge, not all of those natural things are practical....."
175968838,"I doubt I have it (somewhat skeptical of the concept) but I can say my visual imagination is fairly peripheral. I can conjure up a scene and have a rough impression of who or what is where in that scene, but if I try to ""look"" at any part of it too closely or too long the whole thing goes poof. Recollection has the same issue but to a lesser extent. I am not visually oriented; I tend to find imagining a written or verbal description of a thing more compelling than imagining the thing itself."
175968839,I've heard lots of chatter about this show. I don't have Netflix but if I did I would be interested in checking it out.
175968840,Idk what to do right now
175968841,"Honestly, I like to keep a low profile on Facebook after what happened at the university an my home town. It helps not have paranoid thoughts."
175968842,"How is everyone doing emotionally/mentally and physically today? Have you eaten today? Have you exercised? Socialized? Got enough sleep? Taken your meds, if you take meds?"
175968843,tossing zombies
175968844,"I understand. Folks on this site all understand. Try to watch less news on the TV and in the newspapers. Also try to get more involved in the things in this life that gives you pleasure and joy. Your high level of anxiety will pass, be patient. And know we are here for you."
175968845,"Man, Blue, u r making me sooo hungry!"
175968846,"I think i know what you're talking about, but i have it alot better than your description, to answer your typing issue, i dont have it hard but i lose focus alot and always go back to read what i talked about, i usually write all the 1 sentence summeries of the things i want to write and then later write the thing. I also hate it that i feel like i couldnt talk and be real, just that fake act instead. To a lesser extant though"
175968847,I must be going crazy again I feel insanely restless but I can’t sleep but I’m rundown from no sleep. I didn’t take my night med cuz I fell asleep reading.but my night med is Unisom which is a OTC sleep aid. This is ridiculous man _PERSON_
175968848,Pastor tacos.....
175968849,Same where I live. Not that I was going to run today anyway. But I actually did manage to play some tennis today with people.
175968850,"Yeah I could try that, I don’t have my yoga _NAME_ or block anymore but I could use a blanket I guess"
175968851,I saw the opera The Magic Flute yesterday at the Met Opera theater production. It was okay. Not my favorite.
175968852,You seem to be med resistant for the most part...most of the alternative treatments are therapy based what have you tried along those lines.?
175968853,I started as really red but my age is turning it blonde now....
175968854,"I’m sorry Hopefully you’ll start to feel better. For me, that’s the start of anxiety. The booties sound cute too!"
175968855,Spicy Doritos
174359994,I was on something that lowered abilify for about that long then they extended it so it worked out.
175968856,"I could have died in other people's realities subjectively. And in my reality, I'm still alive."
175968857,Oh well I mean I’m thinking if your boss is ok with it then why were you worried. The clients are like a one shot deal I wouldn’t worry if they find out. I was just worried you’d lose the job which would majorly suck. Yeah A2 has become super trendy=expensive.
175968858,"So many things have been happening with the weather..tornados, record hurricanes, volcanoes are going off right now.. it snowed in Texas..last year we had snow in May. It’s not just me, this is abnormal..right? I feel like it’s happening for a reason..signs to a world that has its eyes closed or are my eyes not wide enough open to something..Saudi Arabia had an orange sky with sandstorms..it seems like everything is going berserk"
175968859,Getting close to the end of this roll call.......
174360010,"I'm doing well. My new student liked me. I feel great! I have two new students next week. I'm getting more students! I should be able to reach 20 hours soon. But, it is not really a goal but a barometer for me. I think 20 hours a week is about the most I can do given the fact I have to do prep work for all my classes. But, if they give me more students I will try to manage. I feel wonderful. I have been staying inside because of the rise in the number of infected cases. I am getting worried about catching it from joggers or bicyclists who pass in front of me. They don't wear masks! So, I am trying to stay safe. Luckily, we don't have to teach in person yet. I think this is going to be problematic once I have to teach in person. I will continue wearing a mask outside. I know some people are gathering in public places, but I don't feel courageous about doing such a thing. I'm trying to feel good about myself. I take my medication each morning and take a shower a night. I also put on my makeup and wea
r nice clothes. Exercising is a problem since I don't go outside that much. But, I will go out this weekend to buy food. I'm trying to keep my spirits up while isolating myself. I am doing ok so far. I will continue to do my best! I feel good so far. Life is lonely but talking to my students help. I feel in touch with reality because I teach. So far, I'm really happy!"
175968860,"Yeah chemicals are just chemicals. Sometimes I distrust the entire mental health profession. I often just think of going off of my meds. Why is empiricism a real thing? Doctors saying like, ""Oh you'll have a 90% chance of having a relapse if you go off of meds."" I mean how do they know that? I just read a book called The Myth of Mental Illness by _NAME_ and it seems to explain the phenomenon of psychiatry pretty well. But the thing is, I'm too scared to go off of my meds."
175968861,"Morning people I've been stressed out somewhat the last few days but at the same time have felt pretty upbeat. Spent yesterday evening with my sister and we had a good time, as usual. No plans for today really other than relax. Hang in there!"
175968862,Yes cuz your tentacles are spread everywhere in social media
175968863,Okay the nurse called and asked me questions and I explained about my mood being up and stuff (without being too specific about the psychosis) and she’s going to get the doctor to call me.
175968864,"I'm a 56yo female, after being in an induced coma for 5 weeks 2 years ago, I now have a tracheotomy and I'm on oxygen 24/7. I have severe PTSD, anxiety, and agoraphobia from my experience on the hospital(s), mainly from the dreams/hallucinations that I had but also from some abuse. I have dercums disease which causes very painful angio lipoma all over my body and I also have fibromyalgia. I've always had a problem with depression since as long as I can remember but it is so much worse now. I've consistently taken antidepressants for 2 years but they aren't helping. The feeling of being useless, in so much pain, frozen on fear of people and going anywhere, and just tired of it all, I have thoughts that dying would be an option now."
175968865,Many of us eat less and therefore lose weight when we’re anxious and depressed. The irony for me has been when people comment how great I look and ask what I’m doing and I joke that it’s due to stress. I know it’s really hard to do but if you give yourself a hard time about losing weight and don’t accept your new image then it’ll likely get worse. Realize that you have value regardless of your weight. Accept that you are losing weight and try to focus on what is going well for you.
175968866,"hey dallas, i’m so so so very sorry to hear what you have went through. it truly breaks my heart because no one deserves to go through that. i understand how hopeless you feel because you feel like no one is going to accept you. i think you just really need someone to love you and care for you, without betraying. i know your prolly like, well obvi, that’s what i’m trying to do. anyways, there are women out there that have empathy. i know there is probably women on this site even that have empathy and would listen to you. i’m not a women, i’m only 16, but i will listen to you, and try to help you, and understand. i know what’s it’s like having absolutely no one there for you and feel like you’re always gonna be alone. if you would like, i could do some research for things that might help you? i know i’m young but i truly do want to help you feel better and let you know that you are important and you matter!"
175968867,can't sleep. I'm so depressed
175968868,And how!!! Unbelievable. Started madly scanning the stage for _NAME_: 8:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3yon2GyoiM&t=234s
175968869,NJOY Foul Play - Black Sun (Skeleton Army Remix) - YouTube H
175968870,"Well I think maybe I’m not feeling well due to nicotine withdrawals. My guess, but I feel super edgy and anxious."
175968871,"[Hi _NAME_ I appreciated reading about your experience with voices. My daughter hears voices also, and although she's not able to explain to me as well as you have, from my observations of her it sounds as though her experiences are similar. She is not taking medications, but I wanted to ask your own experience with medications if I could? I'm hoping I can help her to recognize that meds might make her voices less intense and intrusive, if that's the case. Thank you for sharing!"
175968872,Well I don’t have my full licence but I have a learners. Anyway my parents both never got jury duty either. Not enough crime in Canada for court cases lmao. I kid.
175968873,"I know I feel like cuz me and SP are no longer on I will not go away then and get on more, falcs. Sorry"
175968874,The 10mg olanzepine kicked in with benzos. I feel mucchh better =]
175968875,"As far as medicine going out of the system, psycheducation.org says, “Most medications have a half-life of about 24 hours…."" And, “If the medication has a half-life of 3 hours, then it will be close to gone in 12 to 15 hours after the last dose. But notice that half was gone in 3 hours, and by 6 hours you were down to a quarter of the original highest amount. The medication effects could be gone even though some medication is still in your blood.” I quit taking some medicine one time, through a foul-up with my doctor, and it pretty much lost its effectiveness in one full day. How were you doing on lithium, latuda and doxepin? Do you think that’s going to hold you if you stop the Zyprexa? Were you doing OK on those 3 medicines? Webmd.com says latuda is an anti-psychotic, which also helps bipolar, and which you are already taking. Webmd says, Zyprexa is an anti-psychotic which also helps treat bipolar. I took an anti-psychotic one time, stelazine (sp? may have quit making it by now), and i
t made me want to move a lot. One side affect of Zyprexa is restlessness, says webmd.com, which is what I felt with stelazine anti-psychotic. I felt weird on stelazine, also. What kind of effect is it having besides that? When is your next appointment? You have to be careful going off of medicine without your doctor knowing about it."
175968876,I bought the owner of the business some flowers today and had them delivered to her office because it's her birthday! She said thank you twice and said that she loved them. She said I surprised everyone at the office because they didn't know it was her birthday. I guess I outed her! Whoops! It feels good to make someone happy y'know? I hope it looks like the picture on the website because that was cute but so often it doesn't look like that. This one was like a little cake made out of flowers (not edible) with a birthday balloon.
175968877,"Yeah, it's impulsive, risky behavior I do, (only to myself). Drug/alcohol usage in past. Thank goodness I got sober. With sobriety I do feel better. But the voice sometimes pops back up, saying I'm worthless & should just buy alcohol, again."
175968878,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ I can't imagine a hospital for 5 years! You're a really strong person!
175968879,Hi everyone. I think I am getting depressed again. I'm not sure if it is depression proper or just because of the work furloughs and COVID stuff. I talk to T on Saturday so I'll bring it up I suppose. I'm getting around to thinking about doing the exercise she suggested for me. Fighting depersonalization/derealization today. Kind of feel like eh.
175968880,"Took my morning meds, plus my supplements, and an Imitrix because I had a migraine."
175968881,Excellent. HT
175968882,Idk who I am anymore
175968883,Slept a little. Headache. Maybe will feel better.
175968884,Hi I get the same symptoms occasionally and due to my health anxiety I start to obsess over it and become much more aware of it. I went to the doctor about it and he felt it was stress/anxiety related so I did all I could to reduce my stress levels and this symptom stopped so maybe it’s the same for you? _PERSON_
175968885,Usually the hard candies that are pure sugar.....
175968886,Enjoy your vacation!
175968887,I hope everyone gets better soon.
175968888,"Dear _PERSON_, Your postings are so original and insightful. Thanks for continuing to share them with us! Sincerely yours, _PERSON_"
175968889,"Yes, and others have felt that they have traversed 10 universes during their lifetime. This universe definitely feels as if it has a new ""personality"" than it did even a week ago. To live 1 life is but a tragedy, but to live a million is but a statistic."
175968890,Had amazing dreams last night. It was like being in another world. One dream lasted over an hour and was kind of lucid. I was reincarnated as a podcaster and it was kind of a comedy. I feel so so much better than yesterday after I had bad dreams. I feel like I got really really good rest. Can focus really well on the 50mg of Vyvanse - Gonna make a strong coffee. I plan on planning today and making goals like BB. I'll definitely be reading for an hour or so today. Things are good. I feel like I took an oxycodone.
175968891,"I honestly think I'm about to hit another depressive phase if I already havent. It seems like I cant handle little stressors, let alone big ones. And I am sick to my stomach trying to figure out what to do now with my life. I really just want to give up. I really really do. I'm almost just wanting to go back to my dads and just sleep my life away, I almost dont care anymore. I dont even want to talk to my dad right now and that's not good. I feel like I'm in a very deep hole and dont know how to get out. My chest hurts from smoking so many cigs today. I'm sorry I'm a downer. I really dont think I can work full time with my energy level and medication. So sp said it's no use to get a degree if I cant ever work full time. Idk why my energy is so bad. Idk if I'm physically sick or my meds or both. Or what. I sleep so much but I'm always tired. I'm never ever rested and yet I deal with insomnia. My whole life my sleep schedule has never been the same for more than a week. I really just give up. I hones
tly do."
175968892,"I had that for a week and a half, about a week ago. Idk what it was."
175968893,"I was dizzy when I started Lexapro, but no paranoia. The side effects get better after a week or so. I didn’t feel the full effect of it until week 8 but I’m taking it for depression, maybe is different for anxiety. Hope you find something that works for you."
175968894,You should definitely make the cake SP!
175968895,I suppose it's worth it to be on it.
175968896,"I have to say it’s a shame you’re getting metabolic issues already, you’re so young, sometimes I hate APs but they are so needed."
175968897,Darn it. I forgot something from the store. I really dont wanna go back out.
175968898,"still hurting a bit from my wisdom tooth surgery. A little paranoid as well, feeling like people are out to get me."
175968899,Talked with my psychologist and she says I’m doing very well. Even considering spacing out my appointments more than once a month. She’s proud of me for coming so far.
175968900,"I see them next week, I guess I'll bring it up"
175968901,Morning Bored Thinking about doing deliveries today. Actually...no cuz I can’t. Cuz no car. Oh well Been feeling good tho. Just so tired all the time.
175968902,"A sub, chips, bread and butter"
175968903,Well I did get high with a friend and I ended up texting my step mom who is a breast cancer survivor to show me her titties lmao. She has a sense of humor so it was all good.
175968904,_NAME_ wake is a great game
174360087,"I don' know if you will find this of any help, but I have homicidal idealizations as well. I have since I was around 23. Since then i have not actually been diagnosed with schizophrenia or BPD but that is what my therapist have been looking towards. I am now in the process of getting into an actual psychiatrist so that i can finally be diagnosed. But since the homicidal thoughts started I have also had many voices in my head, hallucinate both visually and tactically, and also seem to lose reality sometimes. Suicidal thoughts happen a lot also. So it could be possible that it could be the Schizophrenia or a type of it since that is what they are thinking for me. But just remember that no two people are alike. A lot of mental illnesses like to mock each other making it hard to know exactly which one you may or may not have. But i do wish you the best. Like the others have said, just don't dwell on them to much. I have noticed when I do that my other symptoms tend to get worse as well and then i start 
to obsess over it all."
175968905,"Please try not to despair over your situation. Continue to offer your advice, ideas and support. Eventually your true value will be appreciated and they’ll be ringing your phone and knocking at your door and all of this will only be a distant memory. Head up straight and keep smiling!"
175968906,Had a banana for snack. Am drinking black unsweetened Iced Tea
175968907,Yes I’ve had a few....
175968908,"Black coffee, lunch a little later will be a tuna sandwich and a clementine"
175968909,Yeah there was basically no indication on his part that he was done. But I will move on. I made an appointment with a new one on Tues. So that's positive.
175968910,Just called my half brother for the first time and asked him a cooking question. He didnt seem to mind. I never call him in months so I think he thought something was wrong with dad. Actually never called him before period. Only texted.
175968911,Getting the hang of the sims
175968912,"Accepting it comes from unable to deny it. I've lived it know it happens, it's real i lose my mind at times. Self esteem has taken a shot. I struggle with weight that's a self esteem issue, now mental health which typically scares people. I hate it but it is what it is. I take my meds live my life attend my therapy. All is well as it can be."
174360110,I've done nothing... next to nothing these past few weeks. at least since I got out of the hospital. I call myself lazy. ha
175968913,"I can relate to your madness, with my madness."
175968914,Good luck _AT_MENTION_

175968916,Sometimes things aren't so fixed in one space and time.
175968917,OMG! Did she get it back? I loathe scammers.
175968918,"This has never happened to me before. My panic attacks are usually short but this one has been going for 5 day and still strong. I'm not eating because my stomach hurt every time I put something in it. I had a reaction to antibiotics (after the surgery) and that triggered the panic. I was pretty sure I was going to die. The Corona stuff happening is not helping either. 5 days in constant panic. My meds are not working (I'm on Celexa, 30mg), I'm terrified to take anything else because of the reaction, and I dont know what to do any more. Going to a hospital is an option but that scares me even more. It's just a vicious circle I cant seem to break out of. Help."
175968919,"I just wrote you a looong message full of great information - and my particular form of wisdom. LOL And I touched something and lost it! I'm mad at myself, tempted to ""beat myself up"" for my incompetence, tempted to believe that I shouldn't even try to do these things. That I could just give up or give in. You're hearing my depression talking. I won't try to rewrite my previous post. Just know that MDD is something that you don't cure. You learn to live with it. Good things are possibly always right around the corner and you WILL feel better. Be kind to yourself. Try to do something to distract yourself and break the circular pattern of negative thinking if you can. As previously mentioned, developing gratitude is one of many ways to try to re-set yourself. I'm so sorry you are in this struggle. It can be so exhausting and even debilitating. BUT - keep the faith, don't lose hope. You can and will feel better in a while. Best wishes. I look forward to hearing from you again."
175968920,"having a hard time with spirits and demons tonight... they want my blood again and telling me to jump out the window and fly. Say that I have no purpose in life and might as well kill myself. Don't they have anything better to do than to harass me? seriously... Go the **** away. Reading back on my safety plan my therapist and I filled out. I must remind myself, ""I'm not those names because people tell me differently. Other people don't see it or hear it. We don't have wings!!! Spirits and demons aren't doctors, I'm not getting blood-work done (right now)."" I see my therapist tomorrow at 1 I believe. boy do i have loads to tell her. Get it together _NAME_... you can do it. Hope we have enough time to talk to her. I wrote everything down. I get the replacement cord for my headphones tomorrow. Then I can drown out these assholes. I'm seeing things but those are easier to ignore and look away. I've not seen those bastard *** children. Their parents probably got the picture that i'm not babysitting th
eir bad asses."
175968921,"I think I gained a pound or two, trying to eat healthy though. Hopefully it goes back down. I'd like to be 150 by January. I'm about 162 now"

175968923,"Same, me too."
175968924,"So, if our bodies produce BDNF, why is it so important to find compounds which can activate the receptor independently of BDNF? The main reason for this is that BDNF signaling can become effected through various factors such as stress, nutrition, and the environment we live in. When this occurs, our brains become less resilient. By reducing factors that decrease BDNF production, and by supplementing with a TrkB activator, we can support a positive mood and overall cognitive function, even in the face of elevated stress. In addition to this, TrkB activation may help protect our brains from oxidative stress and glutamate induced excitotoxicity. _USER_ID_: The TrkB receptors exist as monomers in their inactivated state. Monomer refers to there only being one TrkB receptor. Upon activation, structural changes in the TrkB receptor cause it to merge with another TrkB receptor. This process is called dimerization, and we now have a TrkB dimer instead of a monomer. The TrkB dimer can attract phosphate grou
ps from ATP (to learn more about this, read the ATP section of our creatine monohydrate blog), which causes the TrkB dimer to become phosphorylated. Once TrkB is phosphorylated, it can start giving phosphate groups to inactive signaling proteins, which require phosphate groups to become activated. The phosphorylated TrkB dimer can give out multiple phosphate groups to signaling proteins. This means that activation of the TrkB receptor by 7,8-dihydroxyflavone sets in motion a very large signaling cascade through multiple different signaling pathways. The three main pathways are the PKC, Ras/MAPK, and PI3 pathways. These pathways all affect a large variety of brain processes involved with neuroplasticity. However, they do all eventually converge to activate a protein called CREB. Once the CREB protein is activated, it can bind to the CREB binding protein (CBP), which coactivates CREB.

Maybe it's lack of humour speaking of me having smoked too much weed right now. I don't think I'll ever smoke again.. But I likely will.. Some people need, love, others need safety, others need a challenge, others need to understand.. I have it all. I am it all. But I need to grasp something.. And I know you guys find it hard to grasp the way I talk and what I talk about.. It's quite different... I know this.. But it keeps me sane - The reassurance.. AtypicalDisaster got it. It's like ""I get it too"".. The things I've been explaining and trust me it's hard for myself to even reach into the realm that I am in right now.. And I talk about it a lot but it does no good when you're in it.. It become's 'not fun' anymore..

175968927,"I had a 10 hour sleep. But it took my from 11pm-1:30am to fall asleep. I had too much anxiety so I could feel my heart beating more - Too aware of it (Probably either phenibut withdrawal, too much nicotine gum or one too many coffees and the intense physical activity while standing up all day and cutting the grass in such heat). I had to take 0.5mg of alprazolam which didn't work so I took 200mg of phenibut, half of an atenolol and half a zopiclone with another 1mg alprazolam. I'm gonna try and not chew so much nicotine gum today. I'm not drinking coffee at work for something to do either (After I've drank my strong morning coffee at home) and increase the phenibut to 250mg a day for now. I took an atenolol and Vyvanse so I'll drink my morning coffee and get on with the day.. I don't have to work until Friday."

174360132,"I have had psychosis so I think I am qualified enough to answer this question. Neurosis is actually an old term of a time when the combination of the diseases (anxiety as well as depression) was thought to be a nervous disorder (think of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) but even after they found out it means ""no significant impairment of the nervous system"" they did not coin a new term for the combination of anxiety and depression. In modern times, depression and anxiety are considered to be separate disorders which can co-occur at the same time in the same person. Neurosis means you're ""almost sane"", and it's only considered as a diagnosis if you have anxiety and depression which interfere with your ability to cope with day-to-day life. Psychosis on the other hand, is a broad spectrum of diseases (but the internet being the internet, says it's a ""symptom"", yes of course, a symptom consisting of different symptoms) that interfere severely enough to cope with your day-to-day life. It generally inv
olves four parts - Disorganized speech. (The affected individual speaks but the healthy, non-mental health worker individual cannot make sense out of it) - Disorganized thoughts. (""They're after me!"") - Disorganized behavior (copying the moments of the person the affected individual is talking to, for example) - And a bunch of other stuff that depends on what kind of disorder you have (i.e., symptoms of a person affected by paranoid schizophrenia is differing appreciably from a person affected by schizoaffective disorder, although both have psychosis as a core) Just like depression, psychosis is different for different people. Some individuals may have an unshakable belief that they're godly and almighty, while others may have a 'mixed episode' of depression and psychosis where the persons may believe they're worthless and deserve to die. As an interesting ending note, I should say that I am a person diagnosed with psychosis. My psychiatrist does not tell me my diagnosis (I am not from the US) but yes I do 
have psychosis. But it's very possible to get back on the right track with the proper help from trained professionals. With the help of medications and mild therapy from my psychiatrist I am was able to get admitted to the BSc course I am currently in. I plan to get a doctorate in quantum chemistry and I plan to do research on quantum mechanics. Full recovery is possible, no matter whether you have neurosis or psychosis. I once read a research article that said depression could be helped when people over the age of 60 were given antidepressants. But proper and early treatment will help help. Get treatment as early as you can, if you have a loved one that may be affected or you believe you may be affected. Talk to your GP or internist first."
175968935,"I also agree with Crescent7. I live not far from NYC, technically in the nations second highest hot spot. My girlfriend and I go for walks late at night (10p-12a), it helps a lot with stress and anxiety. She and I are also worried about contracting it as well. We try to avoid people as much as possible.

175968944,Morning folks. How has your week been? Check in if you have the time. I’ve had a tough few months my Mum has just finished Chemotherapy and we are waiting on her final results to see if it’s been successful so I have been really anxious about this as you would. My Dad is also not well his Parkinson’s has got much worse and last week he ended up in hospital with a suspected stroke but it turned out he has Bells Palsy so I have also been really worried about him. My parents moved house last week to a new area in Scotland so I helped with the move which was stressful and I am moving next weekend to the same town so got another move to go through and I don’t cope well with change . To top all this of I have been getting hit hard by withdrawal symptoms from stopping my Olanzapine I took my last dose 6 weeks ago and I still feel terrible my pdoc said it could take a while for things to settle down. I’m currently reducing my Valium as well and will completely stop that next week so bit of a doubl

I do meditation to fall asleep. I was up a lot last night with leg cramps which was no fun. I think it is from being less active due to the pandemic. I am hoping tonight is better sleep. I think I will try walking in the yard some and see if it tires my legs out. I take Lexapro also. But I take Pristiq so only 5mg of Lexapro. I like it for the most part. Try to hang in there.

175968960,"As a bipolar, I take Mirtazapine for depression and it works. I don't notice very much side affects, I know it has them, but I don't notice any that are really bad. I've been taking it for about 5 years with no problems. My psychiatrist is very good and I have a feeling she knows which pills to prescribe, although she has missed a couple and we had to change. I take one half of a 15.mg. tablet, by cutting it in half with a pill cutter. So I take 7.5mg. at night. I was taking the entire 15mg. pill for a couple of years, and 15-30 minutes after I took it my toes would start to twitch as I lay in bed, and my appetite would increase so I had to get back up and eat yet another snack. Finally figured out it was the Mirtazapine causing both of those side affects. She cut it in half to 7.5 mg of Mirt., and the side affects went away and the 7.5mg works just as well on my depression, so I was being over-medicated."

175968963,"The pharmacy doesn't have the Dexedrine prescription and they don't care to help me. When I see my doctor tomorrow, I'm not even going to mention that my psychiatrist prescribed it because he'll say that I don't need it. I'm not advocating for myself anymore if this is what happens. 3 years ago, I went to a doctor in the same clinic and said that my heart was beating too fast. He used the stethoscope and said ""It's fine"". He didn't even check my blood pressure. I said, ""Could it be from using stimulants in the past?"" and he said ""No. You don't need stimulants"". So I went to another doctor that is my current one. He checked my blood pressure and everything and prescribed a beta blocker. I was in a negative feedback loop of anxiety from heart OCD and wanted to kill myself every day but too scared to do it - The beta blocker helped. Why do doctors have such different opinions? It's ********. I'm gonna stay away from them from now on. My current doctor puts me down and makes me feel bad. _USER_ID
_: I suppose I just have to let it go - Keep learning from _NAME_ and other people, meditate, exercise, try to better my mental health and try - Which is what I would have still done. Apparently there's no cure for schizophrenia so my mind will just deteriorate even further idk. And new meds are being developed for negative symptoms - I might as well work with doctors to try them or help myself? No.. screw that. I'm so confused. It's a mind ****."
175968964,"I might suggest that you do the book and talk to your therapist. I am not familiar with the app. I actually have that anxiety and phobia workbook and it's pretty good. But I've been working on my anxiety with my therapist, too. It's good to have a live person with experience in treating such things because they can give you insights you might not get from a book alone. That is at least my experience in trying to deal with anxiety."

This man is a millionaire and owns a lot of property in this expensive town. He wants me to visit him in Greece (He's Greek) but I said no because all the women are going and I think it should just be a girls holiday. I'm not doing well right now and said to my mom that I can't explain things but she said that I'm explaining very well right now.

175968979,"You are not alone. Anxiety is hard to sort out during normal times, much less during a worldwide pandemic. You are doing so good by not watching the news or social media as that can contribute to your anxiety. Other tips that have helped are staying active, some kind of physical activity/exercise even if it's a walk around the block or just stepping outside for some sunshine in your backyard if you have one can be soothing. Knowing that you are doing everything in your power to stay safe can make you feel prepared and like you have a measure of control. For the things we cannot control, I always like to remember _NAME_:27 ""Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?"" That helps remind me to stay grounded and not spiral about things that are out of my control and adding to my troubles. If it starts to get too much, I like to sing, read, listen to music, play my guitar, garden, walk. Anything to distract myself in a pleasant way. Hopefully, you have things available to distract 
you as well and can find some peace of mind during these difficult times. Best wishes."

175968981,I think we can all agree watching the news just creates more anxiety. The virus is just causing chaos across our country. If the news stories are correct then we are not prepared. Much blame being placed all around. The big news agencies are blaming our government for not preparing better when they had info in January as to what was coming. Now we have a huge shortage of protective equipment and services with everyone blaming someone else. Also the younger crowd is going to the beaches in California and Florida partying and spreading the virus. People are also in Washington DC looking at the _NAME_ blossoms. We are so unprepared for all this. I hope people get their act together before its too late. I am so sorry and don't mean to depress anyone with this message. My own anxiety is just through the roof.

175969004,"Hey bb, I wanted to say something. Getting on a weight neutral med is kinda like half the battle. I know personally, I cant eat candy and pastries anymore. It's just off limits if I want to lose weight. Diet is a much bigger thing, than exercise when it comes to losing weight. Many people say diet is 70 percent how u lose weight and exercise is 30 percent. Everyone has heard something a little different but its largely the same. Diet is key. I ate like crap during this vacation. I had 3 fast food meals, alcohol, and very fatty breakfasts. Keeping that up I'd personally gain tons of weight. The past few months I've cut back on how much I ate. Having a job helped tons. I no longer have extra time in my day to snack. I personally dont eat breakfast really. If I feel nauseous with my new meds recently, I may eat like something very small, but nothing sugary. Like, a plain bagel. Bread has sugar in it, yes, but I meant like I dont eat donuts or sugary cereals/breakfast meals. For lunch, since I dont tak
e lunch at work, i eat maybe a bag of chips from the vending machine at work, but that's it. I'm more of a salt-aholic anyway. Lunch is usually my time of time where I indulge very slightly. For dinner is really where I've been shining. I eat tons of vegetables. But I'll make like spaghetti squash and put regular tomato sauce on it. So it's like I'm eating spaghetti. A lot of times I've been cooking rice, with veggies as sides. But I'll buy frozen veggies, and put my own seasonings on it. Theres some really interesting seasonings at home goods stores like _NAME_ or tj maxx. I havent exactly found where I could get a good variety of multi-blended seasonings. But my mom got me one at tj maxx or Kroger one, which is a regional grocery store. Its roasted garlic, roasted onion, and pepper in one bottle. I put that on steamed veggies and it tastes AMAZING. That's what I've been doing right now. And I drink tons and tons of water. I only been walking at work really, nothing besides that. I know this may not be the b

175969025,"another thing i wondered if other people have- i feel like friendship is meaningless when friends are allowed to lie so if my friend doesnt want to hang out he can just lie that he's busy, i think that either you're my friend and you're not allowed to lie (i wont too), or you're not my friend and you can lie, _USER_ID_ for the reason, once lying is allowed then there is nothing binding me to be nice anymore, friendship became a game that you can do whatever you want, am i going to doubt every word you ever say? what i do in this kind of ""friendships"" is i dont give a ###$ anymore, i want something i dont ask i take, i dont like something i hit, there's no reason to be nice when you can't tell if anything is real, so ###$ it nothing matters, there are no rules anymore everything is allowed. same goes to therapy, therapist is allowed to lie then there are no rules, im second guessing myself - will i be able to find a rare therapist that doesnt lie? mine lies, or hide the truth with nice decoration 
which i also don't appriciate, when i ask her about things where im dependent on her she always has a long unimportant pile of words to say, i expect a yes or no but instead i get bulshit, i dont really care why the answer is no, unless it's some special case where it was completely out of her hands, something that she could do nothing about, she claims that she cares about me but i'm waiting to see a psychiatrist for some time now, it's not her that needs disability, it's me, so why do i need lying therapist/friends, i have no idea how people can get along when everybody's lying to each other"

175969048,"_AT_MENTION_ - In that regard, the coping with loss, the challenge of filling that void, trying to move on... I think a perspective not to lose sight of that may sound oversimplified or perhaps even trite; is that by the very fact you are addressing some of your emotions and grief here on this site - openly and transparently with acknowledgment of your pain is a sincere and strong statement of self-reflection and should help validate aspirations of peace and self-acceptance. It is likely that your kids deal with many of the same emotional conflicts, no matter what the specifics of the situation have been. There are no easy answers dealing with attachment to what one imagined the vision of it all would have or could have been.... Only answers to how you approach who you are now as a result: likely, wiser, more reflective. emotionally sensitive to the situation from both sides. But there is really only one side. All are in it together. There are gifts in there amidst the grief. There are beacons of e
nlightenment to find how one evolves for the better from such trauma. I try to practice remembering this concept myself, as I have become a stronger and more complete spirit and how one comes closer to this realization o Is less important than the ""why"" once you sign into the big guest book of Hotel Regret.

175969059,"The purpose of these exercises is not to change the frequency with which you experience anxious thoughts (though if that happens for you, fantastic!). Rather, defusion exercises are effective if they decrease your attachment to a particular belief or set of beliefs that are not currently serving you well.

Additional information about the techniques described above as well as other cognitive defusion exercises are described here . Your Mind, with a capital “M.” For the sake of this exercise, think of your mind as a separate entity from yourself. Name it “Mind.” When the anxious chatter begins, tell yourself something like, “Well there goes Mind again, chitchatting away” or “Wow, Mind is doing that thing he loves to do, telling me how nothing will ever work out.” By treating the mind as an external, rather than internal, creature you migh

Imagine that you are sitting in the passenger seat of a car, and the driver has turned on an awful radio station that is playing a soundtrack of your anxious thoughts. You’re not in a position to change it or turn it off; instead, you must tolerate it and accept that the thoughts are there, and that the noise is unpleasant. A keychain in your pocket. You most likely carry a set of keys with you always. Try assigning each of your most common anxious thoughts to a specific key. When you use that key, make yourself think the corresponding thought. Notice that you can carry the thought and not always think it, and also that when you do think the thought, you can still use the key. It is possible to carry difficulty beliefs with you, and not let them dictate your actions. A bossy bully. Treat your thought like a bully on the playground of adulthood and ask, “Who is in charge here? Is my thought in cha

175969070,"Elsewhere in the forum I have posted about my recent adventures with palpitations. This has led me down a new path where I discovered something that I am curious about for others who suffer from anxiety disorder. Has anyone else gotten to the point that they feel comfortable going to doctor's offices? I noticed this last week when I had to visit the emergency room. Upon pulling up to the hospital, I found a bit of relief wash over me. Especially when I saw that the place was just about deserted and I was the only patient up there (the beauty of a small town emergency room.) Two days later I went for my follow up with my primary doctor, and I've been up there for so much stuff the last few years I no longer feel anxious going in. Especially considering she isn't taking new patients. I am often the only one in there prior to the next person's appointment and it helps me to considerably relax. I feel like when doctors know what is going on with me that I feel more secure and like it gives me a morale 
boost. I also realized that this is probably a significant sign of just how bad my anxiety really is if I am to the point that going to the doctor's office actually makes me feel better just by going and that I have gotten comfortable in a place known to give almost everyone anxiety. Is this something that anyone else experiences?"

175969078,"I was held back in the first grade. There, I had to read _NAME_ and the Giant Peach. It was awful. Who cares about some nobody, flying in a peach that nobody cares about, to who knows where. I don't even like peaches! I want to keep roasting this terrible book but that's not my entire point. The point is that we, as humans, need to find books that custom suit what we are moved by. The first great book I read was Ender's Game. A book about a kid genius who suffers isolation in order to grow in creativity in combat. What I learned is that I enjoy books where the character is of higher intelligence that is meant to suffer to become more than who he is now. It's part of the ""hero's journey"" found in great literature. A common book me and SP love is The Name of the Wind. Again a protagonist of higher intelligence that must encounter suffering for the sake of overcoming to forge his steel. _NAME_'s Odyssey has a lot of the same makings and it was written like 2,700 years ago! If you do enjoy this formu
la I recommend googling genius protagonists and a goodreads.com list will be found and check out those books. However, that might not be your jam. And that's cool. I started my journey reading with the Great Books of Western Civilization works to give me focus. I read most of them. The only downfall is that female writers are slim. Still, _NAME_ Frankenstein is in the top 10, a must. But theres just not enough o them, or people of color. So there is a limitation or a flaw. So what moves you? Why do you want to read? What are you looking for in a book exactly? Fiction, nonfiction, biographies? I need to read more biographies. What I find interesting, and what you find interesting, might be vastly different though. Part of my trick to focus on reading is the setting I choose. I often go without my laptop to a café, library, or bar and put my ear buds in. If you don't have an electronic/instrumental playlist that helps you focus, you can always use mine on Spotify! I'll link you to it if you want to check it ou
t. The point is that you don't want to be distracted by the ubiquitous screen found everywhere. It kills focus."

175969082,"You are very smart to write in. You are very fortunate that there are websites like this one so you can get different opinions, and get help. It’s good that you are seeing a psychiatrist. You say you have bipolar 1, which net says has the full mania and depression, which is what I have, also. Bipolar 2 has reduced or hypomania, net says. I looked on the net for the medicine you are taking, “clonazepam” and mayoclinic.org says that “Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine.” Web.md.com says, “Benzodiazeines are a type of medication known as tranquilizers. Familiar names include Valium and Xanax. ""They are some of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. When people without prescriptions obtain and take these drugs for their sedating effects, use turns into abuse.” I’ve heard on this site, and on the net such as the above medical websites, where benzodiazepines are for short-term use, but not for long term anxiety, depression or bipolar. They are not meant for that. They 
are meant to calm you down for months and years, but not get you addicted for a few hours worth of relief. What are the other two medicines you are taking? Again, I’m the same diagnosis that you are, Bipolar 1. Yet I’m only on 2 meds, and neither one is a benzo. I’m on the anti-depressant Mirtazapine, and I’m on Lithium which caps the antidepressant from sending me into mania, and also calms me down. Webmd says examples of mood stabilizers are: Carbamazepine; (Tegretol); Divalproex sodium (Depakote); Lamotrigine (Lamictal); Lithium; Valproic acid (Depakene). Adding, ""Mood stabilizers are medicines that treat and prevent highs (mania) and lows (depression). They also help to keep your moods from interfering with work, school, or your social life."". For panic attacks, you said, “ So the psychiatrist gave me clonazepam. But when I run out of it I use cannabis oil. The psychiatrist doesn’t wanna give me too much clonazepam cause I have a history of addiction."" “Sometimes I will have alcohol when 
i can’t get cannabis oil. I am seeing my psychiatrist today so I started getting panic attacks when my husband left the country and I had to take care of our son maybe he will adjust my meds again."" ""I also feel like the cannabis oil and alcohol is not helping my symptoms at all.” This is just my opinion, but is there any chance you can get on a stabilizer and an antidepressant? Anyway you can get off the benzo as part of the treatment?"

Plus, Spyro ignited TRILOGY and Crash Bandicoot TRILOGY were remakes and they started at $40, not $60. This is just a single remake for $60, not even a trilogy despite there being multiple Mystery Dungeon games. I may buy it when it's on sale though... but I won't bite until it's $40.

174360384,"I'm asking my psychiatrist to lower my Invega injection from 150mg to 100mg. It was already prolonged from every 3 weeks to 4 weeks. I got the injection last Friday and I suppose it's kicking in. I'm on way too much antipsychotic and I didn't realize it because I was so used to taking antipsychotics. I don't want to have a large drop in IQ in ten years so I want to do this now. Antipsychotics decrease grey matter in the brain.. so brain cells.. It shrinks the brain. Schizophrenia may do this - Especially negative symptoms from lack of neuroplasticity. But I think I might be slightly autistic so maybe I was misdiagnosed even though I had psychosis. But I believe it was triggered by stress and environmental factors and not genetics. When I wasn't on Vyvanse, I used to be lying in bed all day doing nothing.. just thinking.. It's horrible. Now the Vyvanse helped somewhat but I think the best solution is to decrease the Invega Sustenna. I probably only need 3mg of Invega in pill form. A low dose of anti
psychotic."

I know with the pandemic, everything has gotten messed up, but still, I think that my psychiatrist and I have gotten off course. Perhaps way off course. The reason I think this is because I'm on way more medication in terms of dosage and of the number of medications I take. I just wanted to get your opinion as to whether I should find a new psychiatrist or not. It's hard for me because I've been seeing this one for around 6 years now, and I have generally thought he's done a decent job. But as of late, I'm finding myself more and more frustrated about the meds and what we're doing because we seem to lack a clear consensus. My parents repeatedly tell me that I'm basically the one to blame because I don't tell the psychiatrist the right stuff, etc. But hey, I mean I am the patient, I remind them. Any ideas on what to do?"

174360422,"Hi onlyitj. welcome to Psych Central. I am sorry you are not feeling safe due to invasive thoughts present in your wife. It sounds like she is not having a grip on reality or a strong sense of wanting to keep her family safe. Since they have a professional, you may want to reach out to them and tell them the kind of thoughts she is having. This would let them decide if she needs a med change or possibly hospitalization in the case where she is a real danger to others or herself. If the doc does not do anything, you may want to consider a change of doctors or an ER visit if things get out of control. The police are usually a last resort, but if you and the kids are threatened, it may be needed. If you have family that might take care of the kids maybe that would help to have them out of the front lines. Maybe sleeping in different rooms behind a secured door might help you sleep better.

174360424,"drugs.com says ambilify is an antipsychotic which treats schizophrenia and bipolar. As a bipolar, diagnosed and treated of course for 15 years as a depressive, I was given a now phased out anti-psychotic, Stelizine (sp?), and it made me want to move all the time. I would walk to the park, I would walk around the apartment, when I sat down to eat I would tap my foot so that I could be moving. They've improved anti-psychotics since then, but then you say, ""five days ago I was switched to Abily"" and ""The abilify gives me a headache (feel queasy )and it makes feel so restless that I cannot stop moving around . This will last about 7 to 8 hours. I am on 1 mg of abilify for two weeks and then up to 2 mg."" drugs.com says the side effects of Abilify can include: ""severe agitation, distress, or restless feeling; twitching or uncontrollable movements of your eyes, lips, tongue, face, arms, or legs; mask-like appearance of the face, trouble swallowing, problems with speech; anxiety, feeling restless; sle
ep problems (insomnia)."" I can understand why you are fed up. It is a very distressing feeling. For bipolar, I am on Mirtazapine antidepressant (7.5 mg a day) and Llithium (600 mg. a day) which treats the mania and is also a stabilizer which keeps the Mirtazapine from making me go manic."

There was people who I lived with in a house but they were completely separate from me and I don't know how they felt about each other either. There was a hell of a lot of violence and thieving as well. There was no kindness at all. Very little food or luxuries. I can remember an overall feeling of shame when I was very young because I knew this wasn't right and I didn't want anyone to know that this was where I came from. I never had clean clothes for school and I didn't even have a toothbrush until I got put into care. I used to have a shower at a friend's house once a week. It was ######6 ridiculous when I look back because it wasn't as if there was a shortage of money. Spent most of my time outside the home and I kind of used to adopt other people's parents and make myself at home in their houses. I was much better when I was in children's homes because I didn't have to pretend I had a family then.

I've had health anxiety off and on. Having had cancer twice and more recently heart disease, the anxiety does have a basis in fact. But doing what I can realistically do to maintain good health is in my control, so that reduces the associated anxiety."

175969196,"_PERSON_, bless your heart. It can be easy to fall into bad behavior we watched as we were growing up. Your strong stance that you would never hit a woman, given your past experiences, is to be commended. I understand the kind of anger you speak of, out of control anger that grabs you or an elevated anger you may even allow yourself for the time at hand. It can be hard to call yourself back from an angry outburst and while knowing this from the start, we permit it to heat up more. Even when you realize you can be causing another emotional harms. We only hope that our sorrow about our actions could stop us the next time. I found that usually it did not stop my next outburst. Actually, I think sometimes we are expecting others to feel the weight of our problem. We want them to feel the weight to underline to them the chaos we are feeling internally. A good question...are our angry outburst much more likely to occur in front of others? If so, then I would say we want another person to feel the weight 
of our problem(s) at hand. A selfish act? Probably. When you get so fed up with problems and especially repeated or unresolved problems it seems like the only way to go. Until you can calm yourself back down. I get it, I've done plenty of it in my life. If you think about it, it never brings any type of relief. You finish up feeling exhausted and with a good possibility of an accompanying headache. (Where are the Tylenol? Oh, they are now scattered across the floor. Right?) And whatever made you mad in the first place is still waiting. Perhaps that is a key. To understand the loud emotional outburst will resolve nothing. Now I am talking to you and me both here. But it can and does bring regret, shame & a certain loss of standing with others as well. I imagine it must involve some selfishness on our parts too. A selfishness that we think we deserve. I personally will know to stop my bad behavior and will allow myself to continue. And I know at times I look like a nut. So, what to do about it? One thing I can 
say is that problems come in and out of our lives all of the time. That is a real part of our existence. So, establishing that problems will always play a part in our lives perhaps we need to change the way we approach them. This is not to take away the difficulty of a problem, yet maybe lessen its impact on us. It would be wise to establish at the very start how losing control stops us from the first steps involved in solving a problem. Much like how you described your car problem for example. So, in effect, we are slipping away from the cure of the problem. I realize that you recognize this all ready. Yet it is so much easier to end up with misinformation when we are so riled up. And the usual case is this misinformation grows the problem. It rarely seems to lighten a problem. Practice at some self-parenting should help. Downright making yourself behave properly when we do not want to. I guess it might be like dividing yourself from your own self. One self is a child and the other self the parent. Could it 
be that we sometimes think that others around us will come to the rescue and parent us? Maybe, maybe not. Its worth investigating. We could also imagine ourselves at the mercy of another's outburst. You know and I know we would want it to stop. A gift to another, that's what it would come to. To stop our self-centered behavior and rescue our loved ones. It comes free of charge. It is a choice and one we owe to ourselves and to others. When we are so angry and acting out we think it something we own. Something we can do with what we want to. This anger. In a courtroom, before a judge most of us can shut it down. After all, we are in a courtroom and could make ourselves look real bad. Not good in a courtroom. Maybe that can be a tool to work with too. To imagine ourselves before a court of law. I believe patience plays a huge part. I know that I used up my patience & tolerance long, long ago. Out of everything I've written here for both you and I, I think the part about us thinking we own the anger to do with w
hat we want & the bit about a selfishness that we think we deserve are both key points. _PERSON_, I have been writing this to you and to myself. I think there are a few points worth hashing out. Good luck and my best wishes to your recovery from this self-made trap we both have created in our lives. I sure hope what I've written has made some sense. If any of this helps, let me know. If you discover something I have not mentioned that really helps you, tell me about it because I could use advice too! _PERSON_"

At age 18, I believe for me it was made worse by drinking dextromethorphan where I realized the meaning to the universe. Now I'm medicated but it seems that when I do have psychotic symptoms, I'm able to recognize it yet consumed by the thoughts to where there's no changing the thoughts without an PRN antipsychotic at the end of my injection. So antipsychotic medication is important. You should not refuse medication. A lot of my visual hallucinations were hypnotic ones where I'd wake up and have a conversation with family members that weren't there and they'd tell me weird things. I remember leaving school by just walking out of class because I was so paranoid thinking helicopters were after me, walking fast to home and then ta
king a high dose of risperidone to knock me out, all the psychotic writing I made on my laptop and agitation. Then I'd get bad akathisia from the risperidone. It all happened because I stopped taking the risperidone because I was too tired. It seems like there's a source for the voices (Like behind a door) but no one was home. I had thoughts of the legs of my family members being in the bathtub downstairs. It was a really bazar time. Thinking something in my mind which was an orb of some sort would give me great knowledge. I saw it with peoples faces coming up to my vision and disappearing. But now I'm on the right meds so you should find the right medication. To me, the psychosis seemed like what happened on my bad psilocybin trips."

175969206,"I hope you have been able to reach out to someone or are making plans to address your depression. You are so not irrelevant. You do matter. And you have been through trauma which does different things to different people. Having someone like a therapist, a family member, a spouse, or a friend to talk to can make all the difference in the world. If you are religious at all, you may find comfort from Psalm 34:18 where it says ""Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; He saves those who are crushed in spirit."" If all those things above such as meditation, counseling, prayer, confiding in a loved one still do not seem to work, there is no shame in seeking medicinal help. You may have an imbalance that the depression meds will address. And you are certainly not a failure for needing help. I hope you are able to receive the help you need and will have better days ahead. Best wishes."

175969216,"Unless you were sleeping outdoors or have had an infestation of bats in your house, it sounds extremely rare for something like that to happen while you are sleeping... and even then so... a bat likely wouldn’t bite you unless you were endangering its safety or handling it unqualified to do something along the lines such as holding exotic species. Bats are rare in North America as well so it’s probably easier to believe that you don’t have rabies and didn’t get bit by a bat and that a bite from a bat would look a lot different then just a black spec on your finger correlating to a jolt in your sleep than it is to believe that the ladder of rabies and bat bites is possibly reality. Try to take a deep breath, count backwards from 200, and try putting yourself to sleep without a thought worth compulsive obsession overwhelming your brain. If this doesn’t work, try typing delta brain waves into YouTube and find some hypno brain waves to help you fall asleep without worry about rabies and getti
ng bit by bats while you’re asleep. I struggle with mild obsession at times but I manage it well with finding the right coping mechanisms that allow me to ask myself what would be reasonable to have worry over versus what is worrying me out of control. Hope this helps! Good night!"
175969217,Awesome SP!!!! You're going to do great!!! I know it.

Tomorrow I have an appointment with my therapist. Might talk to her about the lack of motivation lately. Thursday's goals are to: -Take a walk -Make my bed -Vacuum -Clean kitchen"
175969223,I can't do much right now. I'll probably go to sleep soon instead of taking a vyvanse and staying up all night to figure things out. It's just hell to be so slow
175969224,"Thanks for the replies and insight. My doc has suggested taking 10mg every other day in the morning for a bit to let my body adjust to it. I didn’t take it last night and she had me refrain from taking it today. I feel pretty good so far - more like days 2/3. Just some light nausea and a little shaky but I feel pretty good mentally. The intense desire to move/crawl and wiggle out of my skin is gone currently. I’m scheduled to visit for some blood work in a week if I’m still feeling off. Hopefully I’ll be better because just the thought of visiting an office in person during the pandemic has me anxious. I do have _NAME_’s syndrome, which always makes me concerned about my livers ability to process drugs at a normal rate."

Your body starts to vibrate alot and then it feel as if someone is pulling your astral body up. But EVERYTIME that happens i fight back and then wake up. Ive heard that you hve to be in a good state of mind if you want to atsral travel. So ill save it for later. The reason why theyre messing with you is because they dont want you to get manic.

Just continue to do the best that you can. I am just glad you made it though covid. Try to over look what your girlfriend said. But don't let her to continue to accuse you. Or ignore it if you can. Right now everybody is on edge I think. But it is still no excuse to talk to somebody badly though we over look as much as we can, right? Keep hanging in there.

And then we had another bottle of wine I have no idea where it came from. It's been on the counter since Christmas. I feel like crap tho. I got a bit drunk and made waffles and eggs at 5pm. Then slept. Now I'm awake with my stuffy nose and head. I'm sure it's just a cold tho. I dont feel achy or chilly or anything. It seems to be all in my nose and head area."

A counselor to talk with may help. You can not change your partner. But you can be an enabler to him, which does not help him or you. If you enable him, maybe you could seek ways for you to change. Please find help. I know when I’m upset, I read my Bible, in the book of Psalms. Hang in there. Maybe you could seek a support group for families of alcoholics? I don’t know.

And for about 3 weeks she didnt have a job which was when I was going through ****. Andddd then she went on vacation for 2 weeks. Every time I had tried to talk to her since she's been moved in with her bf, its been ""oh I'll call u later or tomrrow"" and she never calls and I'm sick of putting me all into helping her and barely getting anything back.

175969283,"Humans are social animals. We require social structure to thrive. One simple example of this is the amount of time it takes for a human child to become self-sufficient. We need a social group to survive. Therefore, anyone who deliberately isolates themselves from others is abnormal. The only real question is what psychology exists behind this. Some may find that, for whatever psychological reasons, they are more comfortable on their own. However, some are alone because they have a deep-seated anger towards the rest of the world. Neither are healthy, but one is potentially dangerous to others. There's a series on UK TV, done by a guy named _NAME_, where he spends a week with people who have separated themselves from society and live as hermits. Without exception, every one of them, while not being overtly angry and seemingly mentally sound, have sighted issues as to what caused them to become socially distant. There's always a psychological reason why; it's never ""just a choice""."

175969289,"If you can afford it, go to a podiatrist or chiropodist and look into custom-made orthotics. Basically, insoles custom measured to your feet. They really help a lot more than off-the-shelf insoles. IDK about in the US, but in Canada they usually run around $300-$500, depending on where you go. Averaging around $450. I used to pay insurance claims and they were probably the most popular medical supply out there."
175969290,"""Ignoring"" may not be the best approach although I'm glad to hear that you're finding ways to deal with your triggers.. I only say that because it's possible that you could be inadvertently bottling up your feelings and that could end up causing you and others some harm. Regular triggers from regular encounters or activities might be better off to deal with as casually as possible.. even without being direct, and especially if it's not intentional, practice thinking of your triggers differently or in a more positive manner. When you face a trigger, your reaction to it is a choice. If you can't think of anything else, yes.. just try to ignore it. Perhaps, though (and try this a little at a time,) try to re-think about it with as much grace and forgiveness as possible. Put yourself in the shoes of the trigger itself and wonder why it exists in the first place. Try to focus on intent and realize it's not directed at upsetting you directly. Take some solace in that, but then also notice the usefulnes
s of it or the good that it does. If there's a better way to think about what ails you, attempt to adopt that state of mind in general and leave behind or try to ignore the part of you that is upset by it. There are lots of other approaches to investigate too and I'd talk to a therapist about some of these regular triggers even if it's to get the emotions off your chest (which you've probably already done by posting here about it.) And trying something to assume some control of your triggers and then returning to an ignore posture could help you feel like you're not just a victim but proud of yourself concerning your triggers due to the act of standing up to that which upsets you.. even if only a little bit. I hope this helps,"
