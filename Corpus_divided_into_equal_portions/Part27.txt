Most of them were not causing trouble and my board & care was exactly next to a 7-11 where you would see homeless people every day. I used to give them money regularly and got to know some of them. One older lady in particular was really sweet and we talked all the time whether I had a buck or two or not. I like to think some of them liked me but wasn’t sure. I was always friendly and they let me alone though sometimes some homeless guy was either very mentally ill or drunk and flipped out and started destroying property. I had to walk around him and give him a wide berth. But on the main drag it really started to hit me. I’ve been living with, working with and been friends with fellow schizophrenics over the course of time. We were mentally ill and we knew we were mentally ill. But we acted normally and did normal 
stuff but it hit me hard that these people were really mentally ill. They lived it. Coming home from work one day a homeless person who you could tell didn’t know what he was doing was in four lanes of traffic trying to stop traffic. It’s like I was seeing homeless mentally ill people for the first time who were not in touch with reality and I could tell were psychotic. It just really hit me hard now and then. I spent the entire 80’s in hospitals, group homes and mental health housing and saw a psychiatrist and therapist (different ones) since 1982. I saw plenty of mentally ill people in all shapes and sizes and in different degrees of reality. But it was a shock to see how some of them they really lived. But like I said, I was friendly with a lot of them downtown."

So in 2010, she took the next logical step. She passed out two types of milkshake—a 620-calorie version and a 140-calorie one, complete with labels that claimed they were either indulgent or diet—to two separate groups. As one might expect, the people’s gut chemistry behaved very differently depending on which shake they got, with their hunger hormones (which are also involved in

For me, pot and drugs cause schizophrenia, which I haven’t touched in like 9+ years.

In college, I had “facebook friends” and a few good/decent friends, but that’s about it. I prefer being alone now as I don’t trust anyone. I could have 
been a doctor, surgeon, or pilot or even an engineer if my life wasn’t destroyed. I honestly cannot remember my life or existing before 2011 and as late as 2013 depending on the universe.

176195713,Sat in my chair today as usual Thinking about the past Remembered fondly my insanity It wasn’t all that bad Their bullets never got me Nor my family members too None of us were tortured The blood everywhere wasn’t real There was the snowflake girl She was cute And the bad guys Always at a distance And the crazy Hard-ons at night And the curious neighbors too For years my family tried to help But my friends up there said “keep it all secret” So the fun times continued So entertaining year after year Then one night I was handcuffed And taken away in a cop car And locked in a cold room for a long time Then doped out of my mind I met a lot of new people My favourite was _NAME_ Her face was painted like raggedy Her pillow was painted raggedy too It was weird but amusing but soon The meds started working on me Then the long lonely climb out madness So exhausting often hopeless most days Everything new triggered lots of anxiety Everything new I just powered through Till I met an amazing lady On the 
dock where we both lived on boats I said come on over for appetizers She said sorry I can’t you know Then later I said how about steak She said sure I think maybe ok I said just friends just steak then go She said ok sounds good Then suddenly life got interesting Back then living on boats And today while not perfect I’m happy The happiest I’ve been in years Made possible by an amazing concoction The magic formula of love and meds

176195715,Amazing Pharoah
176195716,Im scared about this too… was on meds for 10 years with no psychosis… stopped the antipsychotic about six months ago… started an antidepressant few weeks back and few days in I couldn’t sleep one night… Next day I had a psychotic episode… I have a feeling ill be back on antipsychotics soon …which is not what I want but it has to be done .

174392545,My voices got better in 2016 I saw the _NAME_ in my basement. I told the doctors and they didn’t believe me but it’s true. I’m not even that religious. But then in 2019 the voices I had were teaching me about the Salem witch trials. My voices which I still hear are very sexual and spiritual. That’s why I’m so kinky

It hinted that via inserted thoughts, and then made me cry. The voices told me they were messing with me again."

Actually I think some people like what I do, others just don’t care or think it’s amateurish. It’s just a matter of perspective. anyway, I was too sensitive to criticism. But what annoys me the most is not having the strength to continue to train often."

When I went off the haldol I was taking 6mg and, from what I can find, the equivalent would be 60-80mg Latuda. Do you recommend taking it before bed?

176195750,"Hi all. I have always been a heavy Facebook user and very active on it. I am a somewhat private person and would post quite personal stuff on it in the past. I generally keep my FB separate from work and never used to add my colleagues onto it. However I changed jobs a year ago and I decided to add one of the new girls there who is friendly with me. Now I am beginning to wish I never… I thought I was helping my confidence by adding other people in my company. Now I keep getting friend requests from related colleagues - I don’t want to ignore them or they will think I am unfriendly. At the same time, I am finding I cant relax at work now and becoming more paranoid because of it, sometimes convinced they are talking about me about something I have posted! Nobody at work knows about my diagnosis which is PS. I don’t know what to do."

176195755,"Nope, I have been diagnosed from age 12, no meds till 23. I got my license at 18, have been off meds since March, since I know my hallucinations are certain triggers and really, a lot happen while I drive. Usually I drive the speed limit or lower in town, and I don’t drive highway unless I have somebody (hubby or kids) also in the car. The kids know when I see something, so they just ask me where and what, I reply, they tell me real or not. The only reason you’d be required to be on meds to drive is if say you’re on SSDI and your pdoc puts it on your file you cannot pass a “vision” (best Dmv could describe) test, like you have black clouds or whatever. Am I making sense? Basically, like you might have to wear glasses to legally drive for vision, pdoc may go to extreme and put that restriction on you."

It strikes me when It wants to but I feel that’s fair because it all evens out. Tonight I was driving home kind of musing where I wanted to eat. I hate to say it but I was looking for a Mexican restaurant that specialized in chicken dishes called “El Pollo Loco”. I couldn’t find one and I considered Taco Bell but it was too far so I stopped at one of the many Chinese food restaurants around here. $10.00 for a three course meal to go. The place was crowded but the woman who served me was a funny little thing. She reminded me of a squirrel, with funny furtive, little brown eyes. I couldn’t stand there and laugh but she was in her thirties and she seemed nice. But my point is that I wasn’t really feeling too schizophrenic in the restaurant. I forget about it at work too. I really haven’t had intense episodes since about 2009. Oh I feel crazy a lot, but bac
k in 2009 I would have dinner when I lived alone and then watch TV and overwhelming symptoms would just envelop my mind and I would just keep watching TV like normal but I was fighting for my sanity an hour at a time.

I’m still embarrassed about it but I think it’s time to move on. Erotomania is a hard one as well. I thought a certain roommate was in love with me while they were boinking another roommate. He just seemed to laugh it off and I moved out pretty quickly while psychotic. That apartment was a mess. Rent was the cheapest I could find in Boston but holy crap was it dirty. My roommates were satanists (this isn’t a delusion they painted pentagrams all over the f-cking house) and the parties were absolutely wild. Like hundreds of people, hard drugs, and police vans wild. After that I was homeless for a bit and wandered to another state and lived in a barn till my parents found me."

I’m willing to listen to their problems but based on experience I don’t think I can say much that can make someone turn their life around. I just want to do something chill and be supportive… Also _USER_ID_ groups are a good start.

My motivation is piss poor in the mornings everyday, but to be honest once you have a routine and you get to a job, it’s structured and being kept busy makes the time go by faster and you earn. I believe you can achieve, you just need to use the tools we have as well as medication such as grit, determination and a bit of luck in finding an accepting place to work. Not sure about Canada, but the types of services that help people into work exist here in the UK through mental health services.

176195811,"You know yourself better than any therapist hun. You need to love yourself/self care. Don’t let people tell you what to believe, you’re alright. Killing people is wrong/morally it deprives and hurts others. If you feel empathy you understand that instinctively, sadly people like us with schizophrenia have blunted emotions/affect. So its understandable you do not feel that innate empathy. But I know you probably care and love people. Think of it this way, there are people who are gifted because they work hard, or build up skills, or have natural talents. You are fighting the hardest condition/schizophrenia which robs us of our minds and god-given gifts and abilities. You’re ability to survive, and cope, and heal through this mental illness is a skill and ability. It’s good you’re being pro-active and have a therapist. Try and reduce stress, meditate, listen to peaceful music. Forget about the “law” and politics those are stressful subjects. Reduce stress. Proactive with your therapist. 
Don’t sit/dwell on bad thoughts. Hope that helps!!"

I always find the best deals and quality. I negotiated prices with my internet and cell phone company. I also buy/sell stuff on Kijiji.

I really looked up to her so I told one person that j knew that I had it too. I didnt really like the attention he gave me about it so j stopped. But at this time j also posed as a boy online, used someone else’s pictures and everything. _PERSON_ 
was like 13 and was bullied a lot and fat and ugly and no one really liked me. So I think this was all an attempt to fit in. I met a guy when j was 16 that helped me get over all of this. I was fine from ages 17 to maybe 21. Had some depression and ptsd issues but nothing major. Then j transferred to a new city and college. My roommate had a friend that was suicidal and I became depressed thinking she didnt care about me? I dont remember a lot of this time because j became extremely depressed and had to switch majors over it and stopped going to some classes. I got better put of her presence . I think because she treated me so badly and didnt seem to care that j struggled with suicidal feelings just like her friend did. But to be fair j didnt really talk directly to her about it. Anyway, around this time j became obsessed with my gender and discovered I was trans. From here on until age 25ish I was extremely emotionally labile and self harmed a few times again. My anxiety was constantly high. I periodically f
elt the “desire” to be seen as crazy, but I genuinely did struggle with… something. Theh labeled me bpd and a bunch of other stuff that’s been thrown out now. I genuinely believed during these times that I did have schizophrenia but I didnt have hallucinations or delusions as far as km aware. But part of me also wanted others to tell me j had it, and j cant figure out why. K still get this feeling. It’s like a desperate need to be… validated? I mean that’s in part why I’m writing this j want to be validated that I’m not a faker, but maybe I just am. At age 24 I was put on seroquel and that’s what really helped me get my emotions under control. But it was a low dose as I wasnt diagnosed with sza until I was hospitalized for believing I was dead. But part of me is aware when I’m delusional, so j cant tell if it’s truly delusional. I mean k believed so strongly I was dead and the hospital felt like purgatory. _PERSON_ felt like I could transform into animals and that there was messages al
l around me. I definitely hallucinated some but not a whole lot. Like I heard a voice telling me to kill a girl because I judged her for being impure. My moods cycle several times a year unless I’m medicated. I’m not medicated right now and I’m really obsessed with my health and really anxious I’ll die all the time. I pray when I’m in dangerous situations. Like if someone’s driving scared me I’ll pray to stay alive but j dont even believe in God. So. Idk. I feel sick to my stomach thinking I’m faking everything for attention or something, but I have genuine experiences I cant understand. I told my last therapist most of this and she told me that she thinks I felt like j belonged to the sza label because of my history and emotional pain, and j think that’s right To at least some degree but km confusing myself obsessing over this … hopefully you guys wont judge me :S"

174392610,"Abstract Prior research has identified associations between social media activity and psychiatric diagnoses; however, diagnoses are rarely clinically confirmed. Toward the goal of applying novel approaches to improve outcomes, research using real patient data is necessary. We collected 3,404,959 Facebook messages and 142,390 images across 223 participants (mean age = 23.7; 41.7% male) with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), mood disorders (MD), and healthy volunteers (HV). We analyzed features uploaded up to 18 months before the first hospitalization using machine learning and built classifiers that distinguished SSD and MD from HV, and SSD from MD. Classification achieved AUC of 0.77 (HV vs. MD), 0.76 (HV vs. SSD), and 0.72 (SSD vs. MD). SSD used more ( P < 0.01) perception words (hear, see, feel) than MD or HV. SSD and MD used more ( P < 0.01) swear words compared to HV. SSD were more likely to express negative emotions compared to HV ( P < 0.01). MD used more words related to biological pro
cesses (blood/pain) compared to HV ( P < 0.01). The height and width of photos posted by SSD and MD were smaller ( P < 0.01) than HV. MD photos contained more blues and less yellows ( P < 0.01). Closer to hospitalization, use of punctuation increased (SSD vs HV), use of negative emotion words increased (MD vs. HV), and use of swear words increased ( P < 0.01) for SSD and MD compared to HV. Machine-learning algorithms are capable of differentiating SSD and MD using Facebook activity alone over a year in advance of hospitalization. Integrating Facebook data with clinical information could one day serve to inform clinical decision-making. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-020-00125-0"

176196000,"I was just thinking back to when I went off to college, when I was 18. Thinking about my undergrad years makes me sad sometimes, because I realize how much more fun I could’ve had, had I not been so mentally ill. Depression/SI (including suicide attempts), mania, psychotic symptoms, ugh. I could say the same for my high school years, though, minus the suicide attempts, though I was strongly suicidal for most of high school. I was horribly ill in med school, kind of embarrassing to think back on my manic behavior and psychotic behavior (first psychotic break). ???? my med school classmates, though, most of them anyway. That was all a long time ago, graduated high school 22 years ago, left med school 17 years ago, but sometimes I feel like MI has cheated me out of so damn much, and it makes me sad."
176196001,"sadly I’m a little low on the love benefit…and when my dad dies, probably in the next ten years, the only one I’ll have left is my daughter, who is busy with her own life and whom I almost never see. I am pretty impervious to medication. And I have to take megadoses to get any effect whatsoever. I do take meds as I’m supposed to but they are beginning to not work (after 30 years of being on one of them). My delusions are now my greatest problem…they are very frightening and don’t respond much at all to meds. Thank you for your encouraging post."
176196002,"It’s true that some would say to have found purpose, whereas goals are set. If I understand you correctly we disagree about which is more fundamental, which is a subset of which: the goals that are set by us, or the purpose we are inclined to think we have found outside of us, if this is what your take on the notion of transcendentality is. But purpose is only found as long as we have made it our own. There is no such thing as having found your purpose while disagreeing with it, I would think. Whereas there very much is such a thing like setting a goal without having found it. That shows me which is more fundamental."

174392633,"It has been a long time since I took my morning medicine, but the demons and the paranoia got to be so bad that I started up again (about two weeks ago). I happen to have TD and am on meds for it. I was fine when I wasn’t taking my morning medication, but now that I am, I’m having very rapid head bobbing and hand clasping. I am concentrating hard to stop it, but it hurts now from keeping my neck from moving. I think this is contributing to the migraine I have. But if I don’t stop it, the movement makes me nauseous. It doesn’t even let up when I lie down to sleep at night. My neck is so tense!!! I am also scared of TD progression. So which is worse- the positive symptoms resulting from not taking my medication in the morning, or the TD resulting from taking it?"
176196004,I guess I’m lucky. I’ve had the same psychiatrist for 12 years and he has always listened to me and even in the early days I convinced him I didn’t need meds.

You did believe him, which was perhaps naive, but you had no way of knowing. The lesson here is that people will lie to sleep with others, and that people don’t make good decisions when they’re psychotic. I hope you have spoken to your boyfriend and explained it to him. Personally I don’t think soul mates is a good belief to hold if it leads to situations like this. It’s better to be more analytical and weary of others than to presume they are destined allies."

176196068,"Hello, all. I have been having an episode lately and would like input, whether it is that you can relate and have experienced it yourself, or if you have any tips on how to deal with it. So I have this delusion that there is a microchip in my brain reading my thoughts, and that there is a social media website where the entire world gets to read my thoughts and make fun of me. Because of this, I feel like the news on TV is talking about me through subliminal messages, and people I meet in real life do the same thing. Also, I feel like people who drive by me try to communicate with me through showing me their licence plate, for example, I comprehend something like “UR2D10” as “you are dumb.” In addition to this, I feel like that the government is using this disaster as a way to make money. I also feel like they have a time machine, and are threatening me. They “communicate” with me by changing the names of their products. Can anyone relate to any of this? Please let me know. This is very 
stressful."

I dont know how to change society or if its even possible. But i know without good hearted people like you its impossible. We live in a society that constantly tells us were not good enough,smart enough,pretty enough,strong enough,rich or successful enough. Im surprised that so many people even believe in god when in school they teach us that we came from monkeys by random chance on some mediocre rock floating in some unspectacular solar system. The thing thats really messed up is that what they teach us is just their beliefs. In reality theres far more evidence that shows we are special to the creator and the center of his creation. Your stronger then you feel you are and your creator is testing you because he knows how strong you are and that you can handle it. As long as you dont give in to the strongest enemy youll ever face “yourself”. Then at the

174392654,"Well, I have been diagnosed with both sza and sz over the years. Through my studies I have found that one of the major difference(besides the mood component) is that sza people will tend to be more episodic with there psychosis. While, sz people tend to almost always suffer with positive symptoms. Maybe this is why people with sza also seem more high functioning. I have been told I too am VERY high functioning while on meds.(by my doctors) I almost always pass as “normal” and sometimes I am too emotional yet depending on the Psychiatrist I get labeled one or the other…I work, have a few friends, have had a few girlfriends and still know I am ill. One thing I have gotten really good at over the last 15 years or so is recognizing when I am becoming psychotic again and hiding my illness when not psychotic. The thing that bugs me is that they have labeled me one or the other over the years so many times I am confused as to what I am officially. More than one Pdoc have told me that it is more impo
rtant to concentrate on the symptoms rather than worry about the label. To me it is confusing stuff though… Interesting thread! Thanks!"

For example I thought I caused the burns of a burn victim who was a nurse in the hospital I was in. I felt terrible, but of course I hadn’t done that. I realized it when I felt better, but at the time it felt VERY real. I wish you the best! Please seek treatment."
174392663,"some people just say that bc they havent got a clue and they are trying to make a joke, some people think we are dangerous though and thats not right, we are actually less dangerous and more likely to harm ourselves, people need to wise up, we need to tell people about this."
176196172,My doctor threatened me with forced medication. And I had committed no crime.
176196173,wow that is nice =D

176196177,Wow! That is why you are zonked out. I’ve been on it for 13 years and take .5mg. Is it just short term or are you supposed to be on that dose indefinitely?
176196178,Sorry but if your working I don’t agree getting a dog. My sister works full time and has a dog and it was left to me to look after him.
174392673,don’t you struggle with concentration or anhedonia or something like that? or was it like that before too
176196179,"It could be any number of things, unfortunately. I would talk to your regular doctor. He might do some bloodwork, see if it’s something physical. You never know. But going to the doctor will get you more help than you are getting here to be honest."

176196181,Look I don’t know why you seem to think you can’t get better and come off meds but some of you are way off the mark. If I don’t have any sz related symptoms I think having psychosis is a bit of a stretch.

176196183,"Hello all, I have been hearing a voice in my mind. It is a manly voice. This voice mostly speaks through my mouth. It speaks out of my mouth when no one is around. More frequently, it speaks in my mouth (while my mouth is closed, my tongue moves on its own) when I am around people or am alone. The voice says its objective is to make me suffer. In addition, there is a ton of physical pain that this voice claims to have given me (headache, eye pain, heavy/rigid/tight/weak legs and arms, brain fog, inability to hold my body up or weak posture, anxiety, and more). Also, I sometimes get random sharp pains in my body and the voice tells me that it gave me that pain. The voice seems to have a good amount of control over my body when it wants to do something to me (e.g. give me pain or slightly move my body). Has anyone ever heard of something like this? If you know of anyone suffering in this exact way, please let me know. I feel like I am the only person in the world with this exact problem. Please help.

176196184,What do you mean _AT_MENTION_?
176196185,My mum refuses to accept my diagnosis despite me telling her of some symptoms I’ve had and over 7 psychiatrist diagnosing me. She’s thinks I have Aspergers And nothing else and I can not talk to her about it.its tabu.forbidden topic. My former stepmom is amazing.she said I was tortured and understands I suffered and is proud of me for what I do unlike my mum who wants me to work and does not understand. I don’t really remember other reactions. O my x boyfriend was cool about it when I met him on a dating site and told him before we met. He was very supportive.
176196186,"I recognize that very much and i was also wondering if it is delusion, anxiety or a trauma flashback or all three. I have bouts of anxiety and think people dislike me, im a failure in their eyes, im odd, i say and do stupid things. It also gets stronger at times, and then im severely distrustful and think people find me a horrible person, they dont truly love me or like me, or they want to hurt me. I think there is this gray area between anxiety and delusion…where sometimes it is mostly social anxiety and sometimes anxiety is so strong it gets delusional."
176196187,"True, or it’s bit’s of paper!"
174392668,I used to have an Adderall prescription so then I was much more helpful. Now without it I feel useless. My mom took it away from me when she searched my purse and then thought I took too much but I have a very high tolerance. Now I don’t do anything. I feel useless. I don’t know if I really have schizophrenia but with this as a symptom I definitely have it.
176196188,"So I read the first five pages of my core text again for a sixth time. I also read the first chapter of “Health Economics Made Easy”. Both of these things I did by 10:10am, which is excellent. Thank you."

176196202,"How to Communicate is a lucid introduction to human relationships. Although people talk to others, the basics of human communication are sometimes lost to a great number of people. They pay attention only to what was said and don’t notice the posture of the person or the timbre of their voice. Most communication is wrapped up in these little cues, and as I said, many fail to take notice. The authors put together a number of situations that could arise in your day-to-day life. For instance, asking for a pay raise, getting a better deal for a used car, getting into fights with a significant other or child. All of these situations are covered in this book. The book is slightly old, but the only way you can really tell is because they talk about ‘tape decks’ in cars. The advice is pretty timeless, so that doesn’t really add or subtract from the book, I merely thought it was interesting."

I still believe some things, which when talking about, I’m told isn’t possible, highly unlikely, doesn’t work like that etc. I have trouble distinguishing which was delusion, which really happened.

That’s when the demiurge, known by most gnostics as Yaldabaoth, and whom I controversially identify with the Christian devil, succeeds in trapping a fraction of our divine spark which he subsequently uses to create this simulation. ‘Matter’ is not just evil as believed by ancient gnostics, it’s also illusory.

I am merely trying to take away the false belief and defence of many that weed causes sz. They simply do not know that. I hate that people can blame the victim of sz for having sz for smoking weed.

And that is bad for my diabetes and my fat liver."
176196275,"Honestly I’m not sure I like your attitude. You talk about admitting yourself for the convenience, and often post about the various places you’d like to move to because they seem nicer. And it feels like you’re right now kinda taking a crap on people who have no choice but to work crappy minimum wage jobs. If you for some reason can survive without working, then kudos to you. But don’t piss on those who can’t. And if the reason you don’t have to work is you’re taking money or resources from parents or the welfare system, try and think about whether that’s fair if you’re capable of doing work, and whether that money could have been better spent elsewhere. Part of being an adult is realising life isn’t all about convenience and the path of lesst resistance."

I am definitely ready to go back full-time. I have been making notes here as I apply for paid jobs too. I put in today for an administrative specialist role for the nursing administration area of one of our local hospitals. I won’t hear back from that for at least eight weeks, but I do have a resume in. I would love to do peer coaching, but you need a special certification to do that at my area’s mental health community services board, and I don’t want to go back to school. I applied for that payables job there, I will have to settle for something like that if I want to work there. I am not qualified to do anything clinical. I am looking forward to working full-time again, I can earn significantly more working than I get on disability. I just hit the savings account for $7,700 to get my car, so I want to pretend like I have a 
$250 car payment each month to put that money back. I will miss my volunteer job when I do find something permanent though, I have managed to fit in very well there and the people are very good to me, after only two weeks. They know it’s only until I get a regular job, and they’re fine with that. They have another office volunteer who comes in on Tuesdays, so they’re used to having someone around to help out."

He said raising dopamine might help negative symptoms but it just made me worse, angry and aggressive. He said depression and negative symptoms are two different diseases with different brain mechanisms. You can’t use antidepressants to treat negative symptomes. He said my brain has low dopamine in certain locations and high dopamine in others and that its impossible to make a med fixing these issues."

176196305,Exercise. It’s hard to do with on motivation but the more you do increases that motivation. I’ve gone from sleeping 10 hours a day to 8 or less which is normal with doing no changes but exercise. It also fights weight gain and things like self esteem. It can be addictive in itself as a good thing… Still. See your gp before starting and get your basics like heart rate and blood pressure checked. That is sensible policy and you’ve nothing to lose. It costs you very little and it’s a lot to gain.

In the current study, we extended this literature by examining psychometric properties of the BNSS in outpatients diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n=46), outpatients with schizophrenia (n=50), and healthy controls (n=27). Participants completed neuropsychological testing and a clinical interview designed to assess negative, positive, disorganized, mood, and general psychiatric symptoms. Results indicated differences among the 3 groups in the severity of all BNSS items, with SZ and BD scoring higher than CN; however, 
SZ and BD only differed on blunted affect and alogia items, not anhedonia, avolition, or asociality. BD patients with a history of psychosis did not differ from those without a history of psychosis on negative symptom severity. The BNSS had excellent internal consistency in SZ, BD, and CN groups. Good convergent and discriminant validity was apparent in SZ and BD groups, as indicated by relationships between the BNSS and other clinical rating scales. These findings support the validity of the BNSS in broadly defined serious mental illness populations. hindawi.com Residual Negative Symptoms Differentiate Cognitive Performance in Clinically...

Haldol I heard can be zombifying but I think you are on a pretty small dose (not sure as I rarely see Haldol prescribed these days usually its used in psych hospitals to calm down agitated patients) so I wonder if that is just for emergencies too. In which case I think it should be fine. Congrats on taking the step to starting meds it can be scary! Don’t be upset if the first ones you try don’t work out for you, there are plenty others."

176196336,I’ve always been quite socially phobic . However in the acute stage of this illness I was comparatively less self conscious of how others would react to my behaviour. That changed when the illness went from acute to chronic. Worrying over making a fool of myself went into hyperdrive. I became a lot more self conscious.

No, im not on nardil, i’m on Marplan, a similar MAO drug. It was the best for a year. I have never been so “normal”. Al depression was gone, i could stay in focus, had hobbies, my anxiety was gone… But then it all pooped out. Only the anti-anxiety effect is left. The MAO diet is no props. If people really suffer from anxiety, i would be the first to recommend Marplan. I am so desperate to work out in the gym. I do a lot of biking (copenhagen) but it’s not enough. When the gym opens after Covid, i will be the first in line."

It is impossible to speak on another’s mind or be two places at once. Hallucinations feel very real. But, this was in the past. You can’t move forward if you ruminate. It is hard to let go, I know because I lived in the past for years and years.

I am ready to watch training videos, but for what exactly I don’t know. I was thinking of becoming a natural health practicioner with an online accredited course, in case this Coronavirus thing went out of hand in a few months (I’ve researched the illness very thoroughly, and can suggest alternate treatments in the event that medical facilities overload,) but there are strong signs that China has suppressed it. There are lots of international cases though, and it’s early days for the rest of the world, so I can’t fully rule that option out."

176196363,_AT_MENTION_. Can you ask your doctor about getting an appointment with a nutritionist? You might also request a consult with a physical therapist to safely get you moving again. It’s important to speak to medical professionals when changing your diet and exercise rather than relying on advice from strangers on the internet.

176196369,"ok this is easy as it gets. Take a can of diced green chilis and put in the bottom of your slow cooker, place some boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2-4 depending on their size and the size of your cooker on top of the chilis, pour a large bottle of salsa verde over the chicken and cook on high for 4 hours, use 2 forks to shred the chicken, rinse 2 cans of any white beans and throw it into the crock pot and cook on high for 20 minutes. You have chicken chili, and its really good. If you leave the beans out you can make chicken tacos or burritos or even nachos If you add onions and bell peppers under the chicken you’ll be really fancy. If you use different salsas you’ll have different flavors, shredded chicken is a must for any bachelor."

176196403,Those are neither negative nor positive symptoms. I have schizophrenia and I’ve never experienced such things. Could be akathisia. That’s due to meds.
176196404,"May I suggest talking to your doctor about a med change instead? For people with single episode psychosis, it is possible to fully recover, but there are a few caveats. One: you must stay on meds at least EIGHTEEN MONTHS after your last symptoms stop. Two: you must wean slowly, under the close supervision of a doctor. Like, at least two full months between steps down. And if you start to have worsening symptoms, you need to step back up again for another full month. Psychotic episodes cause your gray matter to shrink. A psychotic brain shows up to 10% less gray matter than a healthy brain. The only way to prevent this is by taking meds. Stopping meds, even slowly, is a huge risk. It’s important to stay under the close watch of a trusted psychiatrist."
176196405,it sounds maybe like youre depressed? i hope you can figure it out but i know youre a good person and i honestly dont think its your fault people are worried. its just a part of life…

176196410,"_AT_MENTION_ gave the common sense answer. If you want to brave the COVID-19 risk inside the casino’s, than the best method to gambling is avoiding spending more than you can afford by setting a limit of how much you’re going to spend even before you go. Set a limit and stick to it. Just take $150 or $200 with you and if you lose the money then just stop gambling, period. Don’t take more than you can afford to lose. Don’t gamble with your rent money or your grocery money, just scrape up a $100 or more from somewhere and don’t take too much money that will set you back in your budget. If you lose all your money just accept it, no trips to the ATM, no borrowing money from anybody else. Just figure that you’re on a mini vacation, you got to get away from your problems for a short while, you got to be in casino, and you got the thrill of gambling. And leave it at that. Plan ahead though that you have money to eat and tip the waitresses. Drinks are free but the waitresses are working a job a
nd survive on tips. It’s not very classy to stiff a waitress on a tip. And casinos always have buffets. They’re really cheap so you want to take advantage of them. You can get good breakfast buffets, once me and my dad even saw a meat buffet! It was solely meat, Prime rib, pork tenderloin, barbequed chicken, turkey etc. Yeah, set aside money for food too. I can’t remember the last time I went gambling, I think it could have been more than ten years ago, but any time I went gambling at Reno, or Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, or the Indian casinos, I never had a bad time. A couple times I felt my symptoms so I stayed in the hotel room or I slept in once or twice. But overall I always had a good time and the crowds didn’t bother me."

176196415,"I’m not familiar with what a&e is, is it like crisis or something? You did the right thing seeking help. If you still feel like you are a danger to yourself go to the ER or call a crisis line in your country. Keep going as long as you feel like you are a danger to yourself. If they wont help try a different hospital. I’m sorry you feel like you arent being taken seriously. That’s a horrible feeling and has happened to me before. It’s the last thing that should happen when anyone seeks help. When you get the urge to cut yourself immediately combat those thoughts and urges by telling yourself 3 to 5 things you like about yourself. Or a couple of things you enjoy about life. Almost everyone has at least one thing that brings them some sort of joy. It will help you to think of these things and repeat them over and over in your mind. That’s what I did to stop cutting. I was a self harmer for a long time, and I quit using the method above. Its hard at first, but it does work if you stick to it.

Researchers have been biased towards the first. The Higgs Tachyon cannot be observed as it travels faster than light, however in its degenerate form, as a boson, it has been observed. The energies involved to degenerate it are so extreme that any information encoded in the original tachyon wave is lost. Working with symbiosis remains my preferred mode for herbal medication, but to some extent I am amenable to an integrative approach, however, bias towards organic chemistry tends to damage the tachyon wave irreparably with regards to efficacy thus providing a null result. Mining herbs for medication is not without its profits, however it can deny patients vital remedies for their ills. Thank you."

Berberine (BBR) is a herbal alkaloid, which shows many neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study was designed to clarify whether systemic administration of BBR improves motor and cognitive disturbances induced by MK-801 treatment. Male Wistar rat pups were treated with intraperitoneal administration of saline (1?ml/kg) as a control group, MK-801 (1?mg/kg), BBR (20?mg/kg) and BBR (20?mg/kg) plus MK- 801 (1?mg/kg). Treatments were administered on postnatal day (P) 6-10 for once daily. To assess motor learning, coordination as well as spatial learning and memory, behavioral evaluation was performed at P55-60, using the r
otarod, open field, and _NAME_ water maze paradigm. MK-801 injection led to motor perturbations in both the open field and accelerating rotarod tests, which were restored by BBR. Also, BBR improved learning impairments, although it had no significant effect on the Probe test. Taken together, it can be concluded that BBR produces a neuroprotective effect in rats with MK-801-associated behavioral deficits. Given that the MK-801 exposure demonstrates an animal model of schizophrenia, we suggest that timely BBR administration may act as a potential treatment in schizophrenic patients."

174392782,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Diagnostic Dilemma of Psychosis: Reviewing the Historical Case of Pseudoneurotic Schizophrenia. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of nervous and mental disease , May 2019 10 The term ""pseudoneurotic schizophrenia"" was introduced in 1949 by _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ to describe apparently neurotic patients showing formal thought disorders, emotional dysregulation, and transient psychotic symptoms. Even if this diagnostic entity is no longer included in modern diagnostic systems, its evolution is intertwined with the history of schizophrenia in the 20th century. This article retraces the development of pseudoneurotic (or ""borderline"") schizophrenia in modern psychiatry, finding it a pioneering concept in psychopathology. In particular, we demonstrate that recent findings about the positive syndrome, good-outcome, type I ""distress"" subtype of schizophrenia (associated with high emotionality, including anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress) show surprising consistency w
ith the clinical concept of pseudoneurotic schizophrenia. Finally, we discuss the historical development of pseudoneurotic schizophrenia in modern psychiatry as a meaningful example of the difficulty of confining severe psychological disturbances lying at the edge of full-blown schizophrenia within a widely accepted diagnostic category."

I have been stable now for a while psychosis wise for two years. However, anxiety and stress/sleep have caused me a lot of problems in that time, and the autism diagnosis has come through as well.

I’d walk into work with _PERSON_ and then 2 mins later I’d go in the back to get sick. I felt energy after I got sick though"

Some people I’ve known a few years are in on it. Does this mean I’m treatment resistant and will never get better? I was going to try to work from home but the men will watch me doing my work and that will distract me and keep me from paying good enough attention to details.

The first time she said we just gonna go to a normal doctor (hence I was under risperidone for two weeks and was feeling bettet) she called called in ambulance and was escorted to the hospital. Second time I was in UK and I stopped meds and was asking my sister to lead to an emergency room that I could stay in UK. Instead my mom promised that in my home country was my dream job waiting and loads of cash (She stimulated my delylusions) so I quit my job and moved back to my home country and upon arrival police was waiting with ambulance to get me escorted to the hospital again. Third time I wasn’t even psychotic , I was depressed after my relapse and due to my mom lying about a job here and she said “let’s go to emergency room, maybe they will give you some sedatives”. Instead she lied to hospital staff that I tried to kill myself and was again involuntarily hospitalized. The fourth time was really no reason at all as my m
om negotiated to change my diagnosis into worse SZ to get more points into disability. She negotiated my hospital doctor secretly to get me hospitalized to change from schizoaffective to paranoid sz (which is considered worse in my country) I was minding my business at home and see ambulance coming with my mom (hence I was getting invega monthly) and was involuntarily hospitalized again. I have huge trust issues with my mom. I don’t trust her anymore.

174392834,"Many years ago I was a candidate at best for a group home and at worst for a long stay ward. This was before I met my wife in hospital who encouraged me when others,including mental health professionals , had written me off. At the time I was seen as being a person with chronic schizophrenia. That label might still apply now in the sense I’ve been receiving psych care for over 4 decades . I am one of those who can manage at home with support. This is because my stepdaughter was proactive in getting me some social care support , and also helps me herself . The situation was far worse in Essex where there was no family/stepfamily close at hand to support me. I basically self neglected ,but only my younger stepdaughter knew when she made the 3 hour journey to see me and others . This was because I had no care co-ordinator/social worker who saw me in my home. It was just fortnightly trips to the depot clinic and seeing a nurse practitioner every 6 months. Bottom line-you have to have very poor functi
oning to be suitable for a group home. My last care plan emphasised that the support I get is to help me stay living independently in my flat . I think trying to ensure people with severe mental illness can live independently is the main priority , with a group home being a last resort if all else fails ."

176196787,I only hear the voices of men following me when I see them so I’m not able to help you deal with voices. I’m afraid when I leave my home so I get not exercising. I hope someone on the forum has suggestions to help you deal with that because I think what you’re going through is very scary and hard to deal with. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ you are doing really well so how do you deal with voices?

174392836,"To a SZ, the rational mind clicks off during positive/negative symptoms. In a calm lucid state for example, I can tell myself that the person dying in the ER on tv PROBABLY isnt me, and I’ll try to repeat it like a mantra or just turn it off. But during a psychotic episode, I am POSITIVE that what I’m seeing or hearing is actually about ME, and that it’s all clues to what’s REALLY happening and the real world around me is the hallucination. There is little to no rational mind when psychosis hits, just the sad fact of the matter here."

174392840,"(Flag this post if it cross the line and sorry if it is) 80 years ago opium was the most used drug for depression, psychosis, neurotic behavior. I sincerely mean that the industry should consider producing new AP and AD’s on the basis of opium. I grow my own opium poppies in my garden, crush the pods and make my own opium herbal tea. Its very mild and gives me for a couple of hours the feelin of normality. I don’t get “high” just happy and relaxed and it cost me nothing and i have been doing it for years without getting addicted. There can go months between a cup of tea. AD’s like effexor and mirtazapine affects the opioid receptors, so do esketamine - the most postent AD on the market. There is a big potential especially for negative symptoms, anxiety and depression."

I accept its somataform disorder but I also think the docs think i am delusional especially when I believe its neurological even though all the neurologists say it’s not.

174392847,"I was a schizophrenic employee for a year, as a software developer. It was a nightmare and forever be an ugly stain on my consciousness. My first full-time office employer was a professor in my university, whom I apparently somehow impressed with my performance. I had “freelance” experience prior too. My employer paid for my studies, found me a dwelling several hundred meters away from office, drove me and my luggage to the city where they were based, paid for my medical ensurance, arranged that I have a personal attendance charter, did not blame me for being late or absent for weeks and them months at a time, did not replace me for a year despite my continuous decline… All of his effort was wasted. Maybe if we all identified my problem as schizophrenia earlier, it would have been different. As it is, the generous employer wasted thousands of munnies."

176196845,_AT_MENTION_ how’s it going ? Are you still alive ?
174392858,"What stands out about your problems is that you are paranoid. Drugs tend to do that to a person more than usual because when you’re doing drugs there’s a lot to be paranoid about. Getting busted, the fear of your loved ones finding out about your drug use, most times you can’t trust the people you party with and when you’re doing drugs you tend to gravitate to the worst people and the worst places. So maybe you are carrying with you still some of that paranoia that you learned from using drugs. I know a little bit about drugs from being addicted to crack for four years. Never tried meth though I came awful close. I turned my life around too. My escalating crack use was leading me down a bad path in life but in 1990 I got a good chance to kick drugs and I joined AA, CA and NA and got serious about stopping drugs and now 30 years later I’m still clean and sober. No drugs or drinking for the past 30 years. Anyways, since you chose to post on a site for schizophrenics, I assume you are worrie
d you might have schizophrenia or become schizophrenic. We can’t diagnosis you but I can say some of your problems are common to schizophrenia. Here’s a tip: for all those bad things you’ve done, a good start to being able to forgive yourself is to stop doing bad things. That’s a good start and you might have figured that out already. I don’t know how much you know about 12-step programs like AA or CA or others but part of the program is working the 12-steps with a sponsor who guides you through them. And one major step is making amends to people you have hurt in some way. Sometimes a simple “sorry” is enough. Other times an explanation and discussion with them is necessary. Also, fixing certain wrongs you committed like paying back people you stole or borrowed money from. If you make a concentrated effort to make amends a lot of people will understand and forgive you. Other people won’t. But if you know in your heart that you made an honest effort to reach out and “right your wrongs” than 
you can forgive yourself. Yeah, I won’t go down the list of your problems one by one but many people have one or two of those same thoughts but they usually don’t dwell on them. But the fact that you have a combination of all those fears means that something is drastically wrong and you need more help than the average person walking around. You will find solutions sometmes and much support on this site but it also sounds like you need professional help."
176196846,"A life without meaning is depressing. I think it takes a lot to work yourself out of the maze. Maybe have a good rest, make notes and complete your puzzle."

176196851,"(I don’t mean to trigger anyone!) This is a bit of a hard one… Has anybody else ever experienced their audio hallucinations, or voices, manifest in reality for others to hear? About 3 and a half months ago there was one day where I was in the midst of recalling some past/parallel life memories and listening to my voices (they were discussing Spirituality and Satanism and whether or not I was Satanic) when I heard an incredibly deep, gruff and what I can only describe as demonic sounding voice start laughing and chimed in with the conversation somewhat. I am usually pretty familiar with my voices and this one was kind of new. He did this really long, deep chuckle and said, “Oh I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her”, which echoed around the room. A few days later I was in the shower yet again listening to my voices have the same debate, but this time I joined in. I started to speak to them and after a moment the same demonic/satanic voice started to speak at the same time as me, both 
our voices in perfect unison, word for word as though we were reading from the same page in a book. I was quite amazed at the sound of it superimposed over my own, and doubly so at the fact that it knew exactly what I was going to say as I said it. The next day the same debate was continuing all around me while I listened to music in my lounge room with my husband. At the time I was suspicious of him for not telling me the truth about whether or not he could hear the voices too, as they were always that loud and in addition kept touching and prodding me - I couldn’t understand how he could profess to know nothing about it. Anyway, at one point, whilst I was speaking to my husband, I heard the same demonic voice start talking again, but this time, it spoke as ME, from MY throat. My normal voice was completely gone, not even alongside the voice like it had been in the shower. Completely gone. Now, just in case I haven’t stressed enough how incredibly deep this voice was for you, and how otherworldly it soun
ded, my husband sat there and listened to me for about 10 minutes talking like (in his own words) “a man from a Norwegian Death Metal band or something”, it was that gutteral and low. I laughed in delight as I was speaking to him like this, because it was happening again and this time there was no denying it was real; I had a witness! I asked my husband if he liked my voice and told him it was my “fun voice” and I spoke to my voices too about certainly sounding satanic now if they didn’t think that I was before! My husband freaked out afterwards and said that it was one of the single most terrifying experiences of his life… The voice was male and didn’t sound human. It is absolutely impossible for me to sound anything like it even if I try, and believe me, afterwards (when I was in stunned awe and almost disbelief at the incredulity of it all), I tried to re-inact it, a lot. Had anyone else ever heard of other people hearing another’s voices aloud before? I am starting to think this wasn’t y
our average delusion, as it can’t just be in my own head if it managed to manifest itself in reality the way it did, and am now wondering if I somehow managed to channel a demon, because of the way it spoke through/as me that day… ?"

176196924,"Also every person with a objective mind knows that it might as well have been them who had a disability, and so most people have no problem with providing for others what they would hope/like should be provided for them under the same circumstances. That’s not to say it’s effortless or not difficult to provide for someone. But you need to give yourself a break and try to be kind to yourself. There’s no doubt life is hard, and that’s why it’s important to try and find some positives in everyday life.

176196930,This time I preferred to order books again than going to my therapist. Anyway I’m waiting for the disability money and then I will be able to order books and also to see my therapist
176196931,"Well, as most of you know I’ve been a paranoid schizophrenic since 2011. I’m 29 years old. I guess I’m a nobody, a has been (if you can even call me that :D), and a loser/dreamer. Anyways, I’ve been getting crazy dreams about my past lives, remembering what it was like in these parallel universes, some of which may have been millions or billions of lifetimes ago. I’m not even going to question how this is possible. I know I have a mental illness and a lot of this could be fantasy, grandiose, etc. I’m mainly posting this because I’m bored (not really bragging here), and I’m looking to write original content that nobody else writes or knows about (although I’m sure somebody has done this a million times over). Anyways, my theory is my thoughts, memories, and dreams are coming from past lives in parallel universes. Stuff that happened before I died and came back alive, basically. ( Can anyone relate here, please?!!! ) I guess you could say I’m obsessed with the concept of adderall 
even though I’ve never taken it or haven’t been diagnosed with ADHD. I have suspected that I have it or that I have Aspergers. One of the two. I guess you could say it’s a nootropic and a cognitive enhancer and performance enhancer, which is probably why I like it and I’m interested in it. Although I have never taken it in this life, I have been prescribed it many times in my alternate lives, including NZT, the drug from the TV show and Movie ‘Limitless’. All I can say, is it increased my IQ from like 115 to like 170-180, ignoring the genetic engineering and ???? (which you probably can’t ignore). I don’t have total recall and memory of every little detail in my life. I guess one can say I run with these ideas till it’s burnt to the ground and I fill in the gaps with fantastical ideas and grandiose visions/ideas. Yes, I’m also obsessed with my IQ even though it’s probably in the normal range of 110-115 currently. It’s probably due to my schizophrenia, mainly. I think the lowest that I
ve been tested at (past life) is 107-108, though I wouldn’t doubt it has been tested below 100 before too. I think the highest was 170-180, although it could have been higher. I have memories of speaking Greek and Latin as a child in these parallel universes. For the record, I cannot speak or comprehend any of these things, unless I’m ‘triggered’ or something, although, it would probably come out as nonsense to others…I think. Can anyone relate to these supernatural events? Anyone else think they were a computer simulator in a past life too? I feel so alone sometimes, and as I’m typing this, I feel like people are going to laugh at me for posting this. I tend to care what other people think of me too much. I’ve been told this. I tried the whole YouTube and Twitter thing and it just didn’t pan out. It was a total failure! I sometimes wonder why I was ‘chosen’ and such. I sometimes think I was ‘Neo’ from the movie the ‘Matrix’ or something in a past life. This is another example th
at came from my dreams (from a parallel universe). I feel like (I know) I was tortured and killed many times in my past lives and I still have the fear and memories in this life. I sometimes want to know why I was chosen by God, ET, or whatever. I used to be special/different, but I really just want to make money and live a normal life free of schizophrenia. I’ve always been relatively super poor. I feel I am being punished. I know that I am. It’s the only reason why I’m here, I guess. To tell others my story, maybe? That’s why I believe in karma and that the stuff I did in my other lives, has a profound effect on the next million or so lives I’ve had in the past. My biggest wish is for my family to be safe and happy. I wish for my safety too, but my family is more important to me than myself. As you can imagine, living a billion or even a trillion lives, I’ve seen so much ????, chaos, and destruction, that I don’t want to ever experience again. I sometimes have the delusion that the computer co
de running the matrix is protecting me somehow, but at the same time, the code can only do so much. I sometimes feel the best life is a schizophrenic life. It’s the only life where the people around me are happy and content to some degree. My family works, pays taxes, and live their life somewhat drama free. I think I told the aliens (computer simulators) in a past life that I wanted to stick with this Christian family for eternity or that I wanted to live in this body for eternity. I can’t remember. Maybe both? I guess I regret this decision and yet nothing will change. When you take into account, cloning, shape-shifting, and ETs, it just makes matters more complicated. Most people believe this is a delusion… I’m more interested in figuring out how reality works. Today, I’m convinced it’s ‘Westworld’ + Simulation Theory, although I was told ‘Westworld’ wasn’t based on reality in a past life. I’ve been to the past, present, and future many times. I have memories of going to space and g
oing to Mars and the Moon in my past lives and even my dreams. I sometimes wonder why I even exist or why I’m alive or what I’m even on this God-forsaken planet called Earth. I hate ??????? hate it!!! I guess you could say I watched too many conspiracy theories, especially the ones on the Illuminati, and the guy named _NAME_, an Illuminati whistleblower. Since this is a recovery forum, I won’t go further than that. I guess I feel it’s relevant somehow. I sometimes feel like I’ve been multiple people in my other lives like this annoying guy named ‘_NAME_’, a supposed time travel. I actually don’t think he’s real or exists anymore. It used to be an obsession or interesting thing to talk about or think about, but now it’s just pissing me off thinking about it. I sometimes feel I was given schizophrenia by the government, Illuminati, aliens, computer simulators, God, etc. I don’t think I’m alone with this belief. Sometimes, I just need to vent. Maybe in the next life, I won’t have schizo
phrenia, but if the past is any prediction of the future, I’ll have schizophrenia again, and again for ??????? eternity. Thank You."

Sometimes if you aren’t on enough you can feel blah. It’s not all about the dose. Sometimes less is more. For example they put me on depakote and before the depakote I felt blah. Now, the depakote is supposed to enhance the invega. From experience, maybe the more invega in your system, the less blah you’ll feel.

As time has gone on, I’ve noticed that pretty much all of what these conspiracy documentaries said would happen because of the agenda of this global elite, has not happened. And yet there doesn’t seem to have been any public discourse about these things and that they have to be prevented, it’s just that they haven’t happened. Those documentaries were wrong. So even if there is a secret elite wanting to put their hands into world affairs, for the most part life has gone on normally. Exceptions to this would be the 2008 financial crisis and covid, but it’s not like either have lead to society becoming brutal and oppressive like these conspiracy documentaries have said the elite wanted. So I don’t know, it seems more likely to me now that there are no secret controllers of the world."

174392896,Why were you put on meds in first place if you never had positive symptoms?
176197007,I hear you buddy. I was ghosted once and it really upset me. Maybe my advice isn’t the best and is based off hurt feelings. _AT_MENTION_ has good advice though
176197008,Im having MTV on its music there. I remember when it Was just music there. I have my weight blanket its cozy. I want a acupuncture _NAME_ too.

176197011,Negative symptoms don’t always follow a predictable pattern. They can wane and wax or even disappear completely only to be back in full force years later. I got rid of my negatives but I find that my interest in life has dwindled. I have little interest in doing things but at the same time I feel shockingly at peace with the situation.
176197012,"I’m kinda losing weight too. I dont eat until the afternoon and then I have dinner. I just drink coffee and smoke cigarettes the whole day. Not healthy, but hey, my weight is going down."

176197019,You’ll probably let something slip. Like you did yesterday on the forum about thinking you might need to kill someone. Or that your mom was trying to kill you or whatever. It’s hard to keep secrets like that long term.
176197020,I sent part of my book in to a publisher and they called me today. I really don’t know anything more from this phone call. She gave me no feedback on what I had written and wouldn’t tell me the fees for publication without a finished manuscript. The only thing I got from her was I would get 85% of sales through Amazon and such and 100% of direct sales. This was with Mascot Books. Anybody know anything else about them and what this would cost? Not really the motivation I was looking for to keep writing but I have to go out of town for 3 weeks in October. I will probably finish it then. I don’t have the time for writing at home with the _USER_ID_
176197021,Thanks _AT_MENTION_.

Some of these conversations happened like 30-50 years prior. Just what is this? Can anyone relate? Has anyone heard of it? I’ve never spoken about this with any pdoc or other health professional for some reason. Idk why."
176197033,Quitting isn’t pussyish.staying addicted is far easier than quitting. One of the hardest things to do is beat smoking. At least try to sqitch to vaping. You can control your nicotine intake easier and dont get the same bad withdrawals when you have to go withoutfor a while.

176197042,"I agree with some of the others who have suggested moving your alarm clock away from reach so you have to get up to turn it off. another thing I would recommend is taking a quick shower when you first get up to wake you up. which you will need to get up a bit earlier if you want to do that. lastly you have to get to bed at an earlier hour. that is probably the hardest thing for young people who tend to be night owls, or feel like they’re missing out on life with friends, etc. so turn off your devices and get at least 7-9 hours of sleep. personally im on a 2nd or 3rd shift schedule so I wake up at noon, and go to bed at 4am. I can’t do early mornings."

176197061,"That comes up with a few correlational studies that are largely irrelevant for most people and one very brief text with just 12 references pointing out a couple of methodological flaws and listing a few articles that find detrimental effects of long-term AP use on prognosis. Overall, most studies and _NAME_-analyses find that APs do help long-term, but there are discussions about how they should be used long-term and whether, when and how patients should try to stop using them. Two and a half months is not a long time to be in remission after quitting APs. Relapse is pretty likely, especially if you have tried quitting before and not been successful. Are you seeing a doctor currently or did you decide to do this on your own?"

I don’t want anyone to try to get me to quit because I already know it’s bad and I plan on only doing it temporarily and going back to just vaping in the future. Anyways, the voices have an opinion on every medication, supplement, and drug I use. They HATE nicotine. They say it hurts them really badly. The mean voice keeps repeating over and over, “I’M REALLY ANGRY. I’M REALLY REALLY REALLY ANGRY. I AM SO ANGRY.” and it is commanding me to take the nicotine pouch out of my mouth and throw it away. They are also saying, “Nicotine is bad for you. Nicotine causes cancer. I care about you.” but they really actually hate me and want me to die so it doesn’t make sense that they would say that out of caring love. This is probably the one time I should listen to them because nicotine IS bad for you and does cause cancer but the buzz is too good and it’s helping 
my poverty of speech too. I’m happy it makes them angry because they make me angry by constantly putting me down, critiquing my thoughts and actions, and never shutting the hell up."

176197138,"This is a psychologically addictive behavior, similar to other forms of self-harm. Your brain learns that when it gets that angry, it gets the sudden rush of endorphins from punching things. Over time, it learns to slip into extreme anger more quickly, for smaller reasons, so it can seek that rush of endorphins. The best way to counteract any addictive behavior is to find a more adaptable replacement behavior. You need something that gives you relief from anger, but without causing physical damage to your body. Some people like running or other forms of exercise for this reason. While you work on replacing the behavior, you can also work on learning calming techniques, to slowly wean your brain off the pattern of extreme anger followed by extreme relief. I used biofeedback for this, but other forms of therapy could also be helpful."

Yesterday, I mixed 8 oz pico, 1/5 block firm tofu, 3/4 cup canned chickpeas, 3 oz dark greens mix, and a few sundried tomatoes. It came out really good!

176197216,"Cambridge University Press Predicting the diagnosis of autism in adults using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire _PERSON_, _PERSON_, […], and _NAME_ Additional article information Associated Data Supplementary Materials Abstract Background Many adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain undiagnosed. Specialist assessment clinics enable the detection of these cases, but such services are often overstretched. It has been proposed that unnecessary referrals to these services could be reduced by prioritizing individuals who score highly on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a self-report questionnaire measure of autistic traits. However, the ability of the AQ to predict who will go on to receive a diagnosis of ASD in adults is unclear. Method We studied 476 adults, seen consecutively at a national ASD diagnostic referral service for suspected ASD. We tested AQ scores as predictors of ASD diagnosis made by expert clinicians according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD
)-10 criteria, informed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessments. Results Of the participants, 73% received a clinical diagnosis of ASD. Self-report AQ scores did not significantly predict receipt of a diagnosis. While AQ scores provided high sensitivity of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.82] and positive predictive value of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70–0.80), the specificity of 0.29 (95% CI 0.20–0.38) and negative predictive value of 0.36 (95% CI 0.22–0.40) were low. Thus, 64% of those who scored below the AQ cut-off were ‘false negatives’ who did in fact have ASD. Co-morbidity data revealed that generalized anxiety disorder may ‘mimic’ ASD and inflate AQ scores, leading to false positives.

Today he asked, “Well what do you call a conversation that goes from one topic to another and is very one sided but never gets anywhere?” To which my therapist said, “Schizophrenia.” I felt validated but I struggle so much with tangents when I talk. I am working on coping mechanism and tonight we talked about being able to better have relationship discussions. I just don’t know if understanding symptoms is going to help him with all of this or make things seem too overwhelming. I know I’ll be better if he leaves than if he stays and isnt able to be supportive. The stress of working with hi. Is counter productive to controlling my 
stress and coping. I just don’t want the marriage to end over my illness. I mean I’m a pretty cool person (as are most people) and I think I’m worth some extra “work” to be with. Ok.

It would be nice if you could follow through and remove his freedom. I’ll understand if you don’t. In my own case, my abuser was violent, perverted, and entirely too imaginative.

176197317,I don’t think stress alone causes SZ. Its when you have a genetic predisposition and you add stress or drugs like weed to it that SZ becomes activated. Genetic severity is what determines prognosis. That’s what I learned in my university psychology courses. A genetic predisposition precedes environmental stress to cause mental illness.

I joined a vocational program and I never planned my future or going back to work but the counselors kept giving me more and more responsibility with little jobs until I finally got my first real job post-psychosis.

I mean with all our technology today, all our knowledge, all our great strides using diplomacy, wars are still going on. We will still make strides in technology, science, psychology, the arts, knowledge of the universe etc. but there are ingrained hatred between religious groups or nationalities or ethnicity’s. Too many groups have a history of hatred and bad blood and they ain’t going to change so when tensions build up in places like the Middle East all the emotions spill over and turn into violence regularly. The problems with wars is that some people aren’t bothered by them and they don’t want to change. The rumor I heard about _NAME_ is that he planned on starting a war with Iraq or Iran before he even took office. Iraq or Iran had embarrassed his father and he wanted revenge. But true or not, that’s how arbitrary startin
g a war can be. Certain groups want to dominate other groups and invading or attacking them seems perfectly fine to them. Sure we have great men who advocate peace and do everything in their power to achieve it. But when one hot spot in the world gets defused there is always another one to spring up someplace else."

an thanksgiving at my sister’s place. also im blessed in that i have a little land where i can have a veggie garden, even though it’s a relatively small garden. mostly i grow my own salad greens, and some tomatoes, onions, herbs, peppers, and carrots. i thought about growing tubers, and have in the past, but they are not expensive and i can easily buy them in a grocery."

Then I heard this guy talking live on the radio about some pizza delivery guy who had a bad attitude. I’ve also seen movies that had a person who had the same motives and attitudes I had.

174392991,"I would ask a doctor. It’s hard to tell online. Most likely not. Schizophrenia changed me. I have more empathy now but I also have unusual thoughts which the doctor said is from the schizophrenia. I also thought I was a narcissist too. I think I had a crappy therapist accuse me of being one as a kid/teenager. What a dick! I most likely have _PERSON_’s. I did have problems with empathy, sympathy, and compassion, but because of great, severe suffering, I have a ton more now. I worry if there is a cure someday, I could revert back to my old ways. I hope not. I sometimes doubt this would happen. I always had problems making any friends growing up, had problems with eye contact, and socializing. I do have remorse and stuff like that. I think schizophrenia or psychosis can change one’s personality but some people disagree with me. They say a narcissist cannot tell if they are a narcissist. I remember reading the Wikipedia article as a kid/teenager and always looking into the mirror and stuff. I wou
ld fantasize and stuff. Maybe I thought I was attractive or had an imagination or something… Maybe I would look into my flaws or something or not be able to to fully comprehend my face (when the schizophrenia hit, I couldn’t see or recognize my face at all – scary). Privately, I always thought I was smart or a genius. But I realize I am not after all these years. Maybe it’s a fantasy. I fantasize or fantasized a lot. Maybe it’s genetic. I never had a girlfriend or any relationship and I’m 30 now. It’s possible the schizophrenia or isolation as a kid caused me to struggle my entire life! Some say schizophrenic people are odd or weird growing up or different. Some people are normal and the class clown, class kind, or valedictorian. I had a lot of anger and stuff growing up because of how I was raised. I had to learn forgiveness especially since the schizophrenia happened. I dissociated a lot too while in college. I had energy drink addiction and stuff. Had issues with my siblings growing up and go
t in little trouble here and there most likely due to trying to make friends or to be happy. I’m best off alone. I think I would hate myself if I was a narcissist. My mom seems to marry them a lot. I think the worst thing I did while growing up was troll people in online video games when I used to play. I had anger issues. I don’t do that anymore. I’ve been through hell and back."

However 165 pounds isn’t really that heavy for a man your height. I am same but I have a lot of muscle in me. You can try eating 1600 calories and exercise more by lifting weights and running. I think that would be a good way to change your body composition into more muscle and look better.

The voice responded by saying, “We found that your brain has the right logical thinking, and we are eager to use your brain to create an advanced computer technology… We are using your brain as a model for machine learning, to train a futuristic computer.” That make sense to me, but I have never missed my medication, it is hard to believe the voice is part of schizophrenia, although I am likely to dismiss the conversation."

This past year I have usually had around $2000 in my checking account at all times. I am much happier when I have money. I am happier that I have been able to cover any expense that comes up these past couple years, from car insurance bills to buying a new smart phone to paying my car registration. I like having money rather than worrying about how to scrape up enough money to register my car. IDK though, when I was paying off that credit card debt I had other things on my mind besides money.

174393026,I have a biology degree and have training in genetics. I’m of the opinion that everything is genetic in some way. The environment can effect whether or not a gene is expressed. Childhood abuse for example can cause bipolar disorder or schizophrenia to appear earlier as was in my case. I have childhood onset schizophrenia since age 9. I also was recently diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder. My ex-wife and 8 year old son both are bipolar too. So there is a genetic component. Psychological disorders for the most part are linked in many ways. So the genetic component for schizophrenia could effect the genetic component for bipolar disorder. Genes are also linked to each other. So if one gene is turned on (say for schizophrenia) another gene may be turned on (say for bipolar disorder) in you or your children.

174393043,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ Firstly I’d like to address the comments regarding the word “special”. I did use the word in reference to self, but only because it’s a bugbear. I am in no way “special”. I reject the concept entirely. I have absolutely no “special” powers or abilities, and desire none. To me it is fundamental that all beings are equal. “Special” is not equal. Time is a strange thing. You can be in a block universe and yet still perceive flow. Time can be standing still, all about you, and yet… If I can be sentient “here”, someone else could be sentient somewhere else. Then there’s the old “I think, therefore I am.” thingy. I know that I exist in some form or other, because I’m sentient, but what I am, where I am, how I am etc: are all unknown and unknowable. Perhaps, this is an uroboros. Perhaps, this is a multiverse of our own making. Perhaps, we are all already both “here” and 
“there” simultaneously. Perhaps, you just don’t know it yet because you’re not truly just yet. That would get me off the “special” hook rather neatly, and still be truly just, so…Who knows? What’s possible is possible, what isn’t, isn’t. There’s a theory in physics that what “gravity” actually is, is all matter flowing to the place where it can “live” the longest. - A singularity = eternity Things change for me over time, what I’m “stuck with” evolves, as it were. So there’s no telling which scenario is playing out. For instance: I could already be alone in the cold, dark, emptiness of nothingness, contemplating my own existence: “To be, or not to be?” I could have a soulmate that I’m supposed to meet “here”. Something very powerful could be having sport with me. I could be “suffering” from bipolar-schizophrenia. No matter, I’m all fixed, and I cannot be broken, because I will not go back to what I was!!! When you get right down to it I’m screwed. I have 
no “special” powers or abilities, I’m still just me. Me, in a block universe. I cannot know what is happening, and I couldn’t change anything if I wanted to anyway (block universe). So sit back and enjoy the ride, I say. Go with the flow. I came here hoping to discover, that the few symptoms of schizophrenia I do have, were atypical. Apparently that didn’t happen, but what did happen does give pause for thought. My symptoms may not be atypical, but either the way my “illness” presents itself, or I the way that I “cope”, certainly is, and perhaps it’s both. I could have gone to bed one night, resolving to change, and triggered my own late onset bipolar-schizophrenia. Which, thanks to the timing, “broke me” just right, because I got out of bed the type of being that I eventually wanted to become anyway (a truly just one). I could have had exactly the right sociological and genetic mix, at just the right time, with just the right motivation, to “break” just right. Who knows? But I’m 
not suffering. I would describe the way that I am now as: “The most amazingly, gloriously, wonderful experience ever felt by any being, anywhere, ever.” I’ve only scratched the surface here, it’s been eleven years of “you would not believe me if I told you”, and it has all been utterly fantastic. When an “episode” begins to pass, I always think “Maybe this was the last”, say “Oh, well, c’est la vie.” to myself, and move on. Like I say, I’m just going with the flow, and loving every second of it. Atypical?"

I’m back to looking now because money has become a more pressing need with my current family situation. My first job post-psychosis (and my last job to date) was horribly stressful. I’m sure some of you know the story already because I talked about it nonstop shortly after I quit around this time last year, lol. It was a fast food job that gave me awful anxiety, and I made the decision to be open about my mental illness there – against my better judgement – and some of my coworkers weren’t so understanding regarding my difficulties. I guess I was naive in expecting more support than what the average person is capable of giving. I also had shift-long access to energy drinks, and developed quite the obsession with them, to the point where I would drink 
two or three every shift. Yeah… deeply regret doing that, lol. The very nature of that job didn’t lend itself to my temperament anyway. I’m not quick to think on my feet, and I get nervous dealing with strangers. But I don’t want memories of what I endured there to hold me back from working again. I know I can do it.

Well, there was a lot of verbal abuse from my parents as well, but I don’t consider verbal abuse to be that big of a deal.

And in additon I know that lots of us have probably had trouble with money, especially during acute phases. So I moved into an apartment this month and I had to pay dd and buy some things so that it’s a functional living space. My question is: Can you call your bank and tell them that you are lacking sufficient funds to make the monthly payment due to unique (never to happen again) circumstances? or put differently, what happens if you miss just one payment? Does the interest rate go up? Do they make my bank account go into the negative? My credit score is ‘good’ so I can manage taking a hit. The money is scheduled to come out in 4 days. I’m not too worried about it because sht happens and I’m starting to feel better so employment may be an option in the near future. It’s not like it’s the end of the world, or I get struck by lightning if I miss a payment, right?"

176197738,I feel kind of weird. Like a little shaky. Maybe I need to eat? I’m making a potato. I think the pharmacist was telling me to eat with it but my daughter and her boyfriend were chattering so I couldn’t hear him very well. I get nervous with antibiotics because I’ve had reactions in the past to other kinds. It’s probably just anxiety.

All its done so far is increase my insomnia.

Catatonia in schizo have many positive uses. For example can posture in any state for as long as we want. So this can be used to workout, doing exercises, activities like studying, job as catatonia helps individual to prolong the activity without having awareness of time, surroundings and other stimuli. So even the most boring tasks can be repeated many times. Paranoia in sz helps individuals to do analysis, solve complex problems etc can think out of ordinary.

176197767,"I’m purely seeking personal advice here, not representing any country or nation or anything, just me. I remember with my first girlfriend we went to a restaurant of her origin and she bought spiced raw beef mince. She left the table and said I could eat it for her as she wasn’t hungry. When she returned she said she couldn’t believe I ate it all. It was actually quite nice, there is nothing wrong with raw beef and spices only add to the pleasure, in fact I enjoyed it. Now I don’t have a fetish for any particular type of woman, I still love my first girlfriend, but I’ve met someone new. I’m not sure we’re compatible to be honest although I love spending time with her. I think she’s after a virgin birth, but I could be mistaken. I try and help her when I can and she thinks I’m brilliant. I first met her many years ago when I offered to teach her maths. A few years ago we went on a few dinner dates and things were good, but I really couldn’t stomach the religious ideas she was atta
ched to, so I pulled back. Anyway, this year she got back in touch and I’ve been going round to her house for lunch and to look after her dog. Yesterday she made a feast. Everything looked great but there was one dish that she said was very special called agusi, which I’ve googled and it says is from Nigeria, which is not her country of origin. Someone came round and I didn’t feel comfortable staying, but I asked to take some of the agusi home with me to eat. It looks quite appetising, but it smells and tastes like the elephant enclosure in the zoo. I hope that doesn’t sound offensive. She told me that the openness of Greeks to eat anything was something she most admired about them. So anyway, my question is, should I eat it? I don’t want to disappoint her, but it’s really not my cup of tea, and besides I don’t want to eat something just for the hell of it. On the other hand I do love her, she really is one of the most beautiful personalities I’ve ever met and she is so kind to me I know that 
she cares about how I feel. What would you do? I really want to eat it, but it will be an effort. Virgin births are hard to arrange and I would really rather have a son of my own. I can’t believe she’s that fundamentalist, and I’ve nothing against being initiated, I’m just wondering if it’s worth it, given that it’s not her culture."

Whether that is a good thing really is up to you and your history.

Sometimes it’s in response to a auditory hallucination commanding me to take my pills and then I let someone know I took the pills and went to the emergency room and was given charcoal to deactivate the drug. I would say that’s due to sz. Sometimes it’s in response to life’s stress and I don’t want to live anymore so I take a bottle of pills and don’t tell anyone but they notice me acting strangely and call 911. I would say that’s due to depression. So in your case you have to think about the voices that were going on in your head at the time and what you were thinking too and then decide which you think it is.

It’s like, I don’t meet criteria for sza, but too complicated to meet criteria for psychotic depression, like what am I?

And when I fell off the wagon (one time only) I stuck up for Native Americans(thinking they weren’t negative enough?) and was told they were all savages. By someone with different optics than me. Maybe I put to high a value on ‘candor’ because I’ve never known it(at home that much anyway). I mean it though when I say give it to me back; who cares if I score a point on an Internet debate?

Many people advised me to do otherwise but I am stubborn and don’t listen to others. I did have to take a year off from school. But I used that time to heal and get back together.

Things got better when I got away from my father. He was abusive to me. But that stuff sticks with you and affects you. I don’t know how much of it is genetics and situational, but I was a mess. I’m getting better now. Time and life is finite so I only have so much time to get better and I’m running out of time. Time is not on our sides. I’m 9 years in this illness and still haven’t had 1 official job or class from school. At least I’m content and have fun and experience happiness sometimes.

DPS and DUP were assessed by means of the patient records and the Interview for the Retrospective Assessment of the Onset and Course of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses. A path analysis using maximum likelihoo
d estimation was conducted with the program Analysis of Moment Structures for Windows.The resulting path model indicated that DPS was predictive for a more severe negative symptomatology in schizophrenia, whereas DUP was associated with a more severe positive symptomatology in the long-term. Furthermore, DUP showed an inverse correlation with the age of the patients at the onset of both first unspecific psychological symptoms and first schizophrenic symptoms.A long prodromal stage suggests an increased risk of a long-term progression with negative symptoms in schizophrenia, whereas a delayed start of antipsychotic treatment could lead to an increased manifestation and severity of positive symptoms in the long term. These results underline the need to shorten the duration of the prodrome by an early detection and adequate intervention in patients with increased risk to develop psychosis."

176197890,"My first five years of having a mental illness I didn’t like people who talked about their illnesses a lot. I was able to have a job too. Then my sickness got much worse. I don’t believe i indulge in excess in my symptoms. I believe I experience extreme pain. There was a day in the hospital when it seemed like everyone was going crazy, even people who worked there. There were many people screaming for a long time. I was in my room feeling sad about it and fear at the same time. Then I let myself become one with the feeling and it felt considerably better. I saw us as a big pot of hot broth being stirred by a Buddha. People started settling down. It seemed sinister to see us as a broth and wondered if maybe it wasn’t Buddha but a demon who was going to drink us."

Staying out of hospital after a history of multiple admissions was a major step forward for me. Whether I’ve made much progress beyond that is debatable . Occupationally- I’ve never worked. Socially- I had a wife,but no friends beyond that . That didn’t change (having friends) after she died. Although I live independently I need quite a lot of support to maintain that .

At the time I could comprehend what was going on around me but I was still sleeping and dreaming. Now I cant tell you exactly what was going on around me because I dont remember.

I don’t want you to suffer anymore and they can help you get on some meds and get some counseling. I’ve been to the hospital 9 times for trying to hurt myself and the last time really made a difference. They really helped me a lot.

Or I don’t go back to work and continue claiming universal credit, and because I am claiming this it will allow me to study for free at a nearby college. Will still struggle financially as I will be getting £439 a month instead of £800 a month. But I will be able to focus my attention on my studies.

I didn’t think it was fake or unreal until recently I considered that it come to be real. With the terrorist thing, I heard a voice that said something that I would be tortured. I would get visions of the place or places I would be tortured. Like I saw people with black bags over their head being put on a conveyor belt as they were taken to be tortured. I did do some scary writing saying I was an angel and would “be there” at my college and I did come there and walked around. I never thought it could be terrorist writing until now that I considered it. I didn’t send it to anyone though. But I thought my computer was hacked. I also would take pictures of me looking freaked out and took a bracelet and bound it around my toe and put like staples or something in it. I would take pictures of that. I would take pictures of religious books
. I don’t know if any of this is terrorist related. But I also had voices like “123” like I thought it could be _NAME_.

I take an injection, go home and want to sleep to dream for eternity. Then I wake up restless and disillusioned with reality. It never solved anything. My memory has been getting worse. I can barely see the television screen. I want to scream, but I can’t feel anger. I can’t let the repressive emotions of cruelty keep me chained to their system. The abusive silence is making me into a psychopath. Until I am heard I will be full of this confusion and it will never be released. No one listened, but I heard everything. This is war."

WHY ? Because, it expresses about the Dr 's personal expressions ,and does not read the realities of sz’s events with credibility as be seen by the pure mind ,does not agree with the sz’s nature data,does not agree with the existential symptoms be felt by people who are living with the sz’s events The symptoms of sz including (positive,negative and cognitive …etc ),it remains a set of theoretical symptoms (TS),and it cannot be proven by lab detection methods 
until now ! -A doctor diagnosis sz’s symptoms and classifies them as P,N and C…etc And a second doctor fail to find a biological copy of these symptoms or find the anatomical,genetic or chemical source of the symptoms (which the first Dr. said) So that,the symptoms of sz remains a theoretical symptoms !! can you believe this ~ We say this and challenge all the research aimed at discovering the cause of sz from the data of the current diagnostic symptoms"

176198062,We can do this together we’re holding out till Monday that’s all we have to do.
176198063,So I went in today and my pdoc increased the Invega and also gave me Vraylar per my request. Still on Ativan. I’m doing ok right now. I’m researching my ancestry and eating watermelon. It’s so much fun.
176198064,I don’t really see it as an unfortunate thing. Again alters are people. And they HELP ME I wouldn’t expect a singlet to understand. Also DID is not a personality disorder.
176198065,15727 today. I am in bed.

176198066,I take valproate and my balls are not shrinking Maybe you just had small balls to begin with
174393184,Good to know
174393191,I guess you’re right. Hopefully they will just administer the Abilify pills and nothing else like haloperidol or ativan

176198069,Easier said than done - especially people taking some some of these meds
174393185,"i was on vraylar before i was on clozapine. i’d also like to note that i don’t think this effect is from my medication. My body interacts with meds very differently than most people, i know the difference in feeling flat from meds and feeling flat from the illness"
176198070,did it help in anyway?
176198071,Aw thanks:) I’m not sure if i like it yet haha
176198072,"True. Most people will biodegrade, at least."
176198073,IBS is usually fixed by showering. But it’s winter and my skin always flare up from the cold dry air. I’m sure it isn’t cancer.
176198074,I wish they told us what they actually did in these interventions.
176198075,Interesting… what dose are you taking? _AT_MENTION_
176198076,"I’m a little under 200 pounds right now and I’m averaging 1,500-2,500 calories a day. I’m technically dieting lol; apparently with my activity level I can still lose on the latter amount though of course it’s much slower going that way."
176198077,"Oh wow, finally! It’s just a shame I have three separate bottles, so that would be quite pricey."
176198078,I had to go to 4 stores. Didn’t think I’d make it.
174393189,I’m on 175mg clozapine and have clozapine induced OCD. I have to take benzo along with it. Right now we are trying another antipsychotic and will slowly reduce clozapine dose.
174393188,I have found that when I am going through a tough time I would illustrate some picture and it helped me deal with my positive symptoms. This study says it helps with negative symptoms. Really my pictures help me quite a bit with hearing voices.
176198079,"The only way I could be come a cop, is if I changed my screen name. I never did that. My fatal flaw."
176198080,I’ve considered myself a loner in the past. I have friends I don’t see for years at a time. I just reconnected with one and we’re currently texting which makes me happy. I really withdrew in my 20’s. I just fall off the face of the earth especially when I’m living at my parents place. I was thinking about people hating us yesterday. Like they think we’re violent or all homeless criminals. I don’t know.
176198081,There you go. Enjoy.
176198082,"Yes, been good since yesterday night. I thought it would last longer than 2 days. But the 2 days were worse than flu, more headaches and more fever."
176198083,I’m between 69 to 72kg atm. My upper healthy BMI limit is 68kg. And thanks for the compliment. I’m sure you’ll get to your target with enough perseverance.
176198084,"I’m so sorry you are going through this. _AT_MENTION_ has a list of things to do to help during a panic attack etc. maybe try those when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Also, do you have family or friends? It might be a good time to reach out and get some emotional support"
176198085,What did the tests say?
176198086,"I’m feeling so confused. As I mentioned, I’m reading a book by a pdoc about therapy for anxiety and how one can come off meds (although he did say some illnesses need meds like bipolar and sz) and I was wondering if I can come off meds. So I’m tapering slowly off them. But I’m scared if I’m ok off meds then my sza diagnosis is false and all I suffered over the years was for nothing. Was it all a lie? I’m so scared. I don’t want to be a liar. And to have suffered for nothing. If I come off meds and remain ok then I don’t have sza as they diagnosed or would I? My mom said it’s just stress and hubby said similar. So am I just a big drama queen? Maybe they don’t accept my diagnosis because they don’t want to see me suffer. But I just want to know the truth."
176198087,Cigarettes? Never have. Never will. It doesn’t make me feel like an outcast though. I just think of it as something I’m not super interested in talking about since I have pretty much 0 input on the experience. Same as when people post about tv shows or movies I’ve never seen.
176198088,"Do you think you have all these delusions or you read into them and they become your new delusions? I get told I get stuff from TV and movies…maybe some stuff… When I first got sick, I thought my family wasn’t mine but clones or from a very slightly different timeline…I still have thoughts but the delusions are gone. I was severely dissociated at the time. I had problems reading faces…I’m better now."
176198089,"Sometimes I wish I could cry especially when i have an intrusive thoughts, it would bring me some relief When I wake up in the morning I think intrusive thoughts that I don’t want to have, and have a feeling people are watching and listening to me, and also I have severe intrusive thoughts when having an anxiety attack, I just want to go asleep, but going through an anxiety attack."
176198090,"Embrace it. If people are going to be watching you, I say put on the best show you possibly can. I mean, decorations, incense, maybe some posters, wear a suit and tie, a bowler hat. Maybe light off some fireworks or a laser light show with Pink _NAME_. Give them their moneys worth. Leave 'em wanting more."
176198091,We are misunderstood across the board
174393196,"maybe If I gather my reasoning and talk with my pdoc about it he might consider it a more appropriate diagnosis. I would feel much better about my diagnosis if it were shown that I’m on the autism spectrum because I’m rather high functioning and have never experienced delusions, visions, auditory or any of the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia."
176198092,"So my family has been trampled by this nasty 24 hour stomach bug. It was awful. But even though I’ve been symptom free for 24 hours now I still have no appetite. I decided to bottle this flu and sell it as a weight loss supplement. For me to lose my appetite is a miracle so I figure it would sell. I mean if people will use botulism for wrinkles why not use a virus for weight loss, right?!?!"
176198093,"You gave me some golden advice!!! I really thank you for it. It makes sense. Like I said its just a matter of trying your best and accepting that not everything will go according to plan, like you said. I guess I just want to be loved. But I’m going ti meditate and come to terms with not everyone will love me but no everyone will hate me. Its really a balance of how life works."
176198094,"I used to be able to cut deep and not feel a thing. Tonight the voices demanded that I cut and when I did I couldn’t do much damage. It hurt too much and I was scared to do too much harm to myself. I suppose this is a good thing to have happen I just find it weird. The voices aren’t satisfied that I didn’t cut badly, I don’t know how to appease them. I just want some peace."

176198103,"I was depressed before I started medication, then depressed again when my doctor reduced my medication. They were both for different reasons. They didn’t seem to be directly part of the sz, but were due to my circumstances at the time. I got over it both times though!"

176198110,If I can avoid hospitals then better. The last hospital experience was awful! I’m going to request home treatment from the mental health organization I belong to if there’s a next time.
176198111,Wow! That really sucks. I’m glad you ignored the commands now. I remember I made a fire in my house because a voice told me to burn my socks because it would make me a hero.
176198112,Yeah its a difficult situation.
176198113,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_. I spoke to the head pharmacist and she thought I should take my BP med. She said my blood sugar seemed fine, and I should talk to my doctor about the diabetes med. I’ll take the BP med tomorrow and see what happens."

176198116,"I had that problem before. But after taking the same med for over a year, my emotions started coming back. It was a slow process though."

176198118,"Thanks all. It is just all the grief and exhaustion and the exposure for all the church and my friend is a bit much. The guilt and shame is so bad that i dont know what to do. I wont commit suïcide, but i do want to not be here anymore."

176198120,Yes I’m starting it today. It’s being added to my seroquel
176198121,I think that makes sense. Do you think bathing and changing clothes would make you feel better? Probably so. Maybe you can do a simple hair/face mask to motivate yourself to take care of you.
176198122,"Yeah, hopefully they give you good news on your phone call."

176198125,"Both of my cousins who are brother and sister had their stomachs stapled. They had to go to Mexico to afford it but they never been happier. Of course, they aren’t burdened by sza or other things as it’s in their genes. They tried dieting, hypnosis, scams, and the like with no success. Basically they spent 80% of their lives with hurting ankles and various limitations. My point to my story is that they had to wait a long time for a solution but eventually a door opened for them and I think one will open for you. Don’t let a blurry fate make you hate. You’ll make it somehow."

176198132,I’ve always loved poetry and I finally finished writing my book a little bit ago! My creative writing teacher just bought the first copy a couple days ago and I am so excited!
176198133,_PERSON_ glad you enjoyed it!! Sounds like a great place to volunteer! And REALLY cool about the job opportunities!!
176198134,"Without my medications, i would not be the rather relaxed person that i am right now. Like _AT_MENTION_, i have a tendency toward anger. I become extremely agitated and unable to settle. I become frustrated and from there the anger escalates. You aren’t a bad guy _AT_MENTION_. You’re doing the best you can, and for other that is just something they don’t understand."
176198135,I don’t know what it’s from. I hope it’s not my Haldol.
176198136,Is your aunt a psychiatrist?
176198137,"Yeah, but dont lose hope. I was desperate with negatives, always complaining that there are no meds for negatives. They re gone now."
176198138,I don’t have these I am quite social with visitors talking for hours.
176198139,I get pissing mad when they use that phrase “skitzo” at me. Last bloke that did had my pint chucked over him - cos it was meant in a derogatory manner
176198140,"I currently don’t have delusions or paranoia. I spent years dismantling delusions. It was the delusions that brought about my hallucinations a lot. I occasionally hear voices or my surroundings look strange/foreign. Sometimes I hear bits of music,movie lines, or people I’ve heard all jumbled up."
176198141,No nausea tonight Had another bubble tea Read more manga
176198142,Yeah but we spent all that except the video card 6 years ago and it still works.
176198143,Okay I need to take a step back before I go full-on political.
176198144,I was searching for schizophrenia support groups. There aren’t much support available for people with psychosis in my country and if there is one my mom won’t send me there.

176198151,Wow — I got arrested by the swat team and I was on the news - they called me a stupid carimanal - I went to jail for ???? I never did at all
176198152,I’m so sorry _AT_MENTION_ . Do you have any days off coming up?
176198153,Days are long Anticipation Aggravation Pushing forward Only to find The impregnable wall Can’t turn back Can’t move ahead Stuck looking up Empty air Legs ache Bloodied hands From pounding On a door that isn’t there Waiting for something Someone Futile Crumbling to my knees Like praying To the blue sky The sun Beating me down Tears stream Dirt mingling Mud filling My eyes My mouth Choking me Blinding me Falling hard On the concrete Lying still Wondering If I’m still alive My lungs burn The air is too heavy I gasp The rattle in my chest My body shuttered Death is so sweet
176198154,I will pm you. Ok?
176198155,Do you want to live like that? You’re literally trying to manifest this by putting up that bs defense.

176198161,"I’ve seen several posts on this forum where people claim the voices in their heads are from real people talking, like their neighbors or family. If someone’s going to talk to you, they will use their voice box. They can’t talk to you in your head, that’s impossible. Anything that comes from the inside of your head is a hallucination, you can only trust what they say with their physical voice box. To me that’s common sense but I understand some people tend to struggle with it because of sz. Hopefully you can get past this with treatment. It sounds like it makes driving a pain in the butt though. I crashed my truck a few years ago and haven’t replaced it yet so I don’t drive much."

176198184,Wow. That’s a great achievement . Well done _AT_MENTION_
174393213,"Well, for starters, you really are ill. You’re well because of Geodon, not because you are just well organically. It’s tempting to stop taking meds when you feel well, but that ends badly most of the time. Most of us are in a state of deterioration where we need the meds to function. It’s really rare to be a schizophrenic in a state of net healing that could actually recover without meds. Also, don’t get tricked into thinking that “everything you hear (and sometimes see) is real”, in terms of believing obvious hallucinations, that takes you away from objective reality, the place where real living happens."

176198190,My therapist is a very nice lady. I think she is attractive but that is neither here nor there for me to say probably. She’s like 58 I looked her up on a site I thought she was mid 40s maybe. But I was wrong. We have a very professional relationship. She barely tells me anything about herself. She’s really helpful though. Best therapist I’ve had. And guess what. $0 co - pay because she takes both my insurances

176198198,"Last night around 9-10 we heard this blood curdling scream coming from a lady a couple doors down. A shady gangster type character lives there. Who knows what went on there but if freaked the ???? out of us. Didn’t make us feel too safe. Hopefully the lady was ok. Not sure what happened so can’t jump to conclusions. I don’t think anyone phoned the cops cuz we didn’t hear any sirens. Slept with a knife under my pillow honestly out of fear cuz that gangster dude is sketchy. It was definitely unusual, never heard anything like that in the 3 years I’ve lived out here. Why can’t people just chill and get along. Levels rant Over and out"
176198199,"If we think of fame through the 1970s-90s they hold generations of celebrities that were known about by many but not known personally by most. This exclusive celebrity culture revolved around idealised examples of ‘perfect humans’, much like the historic fame culture preserved for heroes and royalty. Today the most famous people in the world are Youtubers, bloggers and Instagramers. They are not nearly as ubiquitously known as the celebrities of previous generations, but their fans know them much more personally. Fame has evolved from a pedestal of surreal idealism, to a relatable, constant presence that feigns connection. We have replaced the want for a king with the want to know (Niemark, 2019); fans have become followers. The most famous people today no longer promote an unattainable brand of perfectionism to be idolised, but a brand of authenticity and relatability. They are marketing a sense of relationship by sharing everything about their life, from what they had for breakfast to announc
ing that they are pregnant. The market is built on the optional one-way nature of public social media accounts, allowing followers to be in someone’s personal life without the interaction that risks shame. The direction of fame has changed, from looking up to looking in. Social media replaces community with audience In the past, honor could be (simplistically) defined by how well the people in your community thought of you. With the rise of individualism and independence, our communities have become smaller, reducing the size of our honor feedback network. This can cause significant anxiety because it disrupts the risk of shame. What was once the fear of one in 20 people thinking badly of you in a larger co-dependent community, can now be one in four in the small network of relationships of a relatively independent lifestyle. One way to reduce this risk is to broaden your social feedback network by supplementing (or even replacing) your community with an audience, listening to the feedback of many people wh
o are not necessarily in relationship with you, instead of being reliant on the feedback from a small group of people who know you. Social media offers us an audience to replace community, and a convenient array metrics too quantify honor/shame feedback (likes, comments, shares, etc). Replacing community with audience has replaced the role honor with fame and the practice of relationship with performance. There are several consequences to this: We lose connection from community members that are not part of the audience we are measuring honor (now fame) feedback from. This has particularly eroded the important role of intergenerational feedback as the social media platforms have different age demographics. Many people have relationships with relatives and friends who are not on social media to feedback to us in the metrics we pay attention to. We increase connection with audience members who know us, but are not in active community or relationship with us (eg. Past college friends, friends of friends). And we 
connect to audience members who do not know us at all. Social media increases our risk of shame Ironically, the consequence of these three factors is an increased risk of shame because you are taking feedback from people who know you less and therefore can judge you more. Here are just a few ways that replacing community with audience increases the risk of shame on social media: Anonymity : by not having to risk ‘losing face’, anonymous and pseudonym accounts can shame others more freely, harshly and irrationally without being accountable to taking any feedback upon themselves. Trolls : social media space has allowed individuals to strategically search out and antagonise individuals that hold opposing views, craving attention by provoking anger, hurt and/or fear in another Not face to face : with the removal of facial expressions and body language that may enhance empathy, it is easier to call each other out and shame one another on social media than in real life I nstant/ reactive : social media encourag
es a very reactive space, reducing capacity for reflection and careful responses. This can perpetuate reactive shaming in a perishable environment, compared to the more measured criticism that might come from a long-term personal relationship. Poor monitoring authority : shaming can happen more easily due to little to no fear of consequence due to the administrative barriers and low effectiveness of reporting offensive behaviour Cancel/outrage culture : these cultures refer to single-topic ‘relationships’ where an individual’s merit or worth is shamed through public call out to the extent of social obliteration (that can have significant personal and professional fallout) according to the trends in values of the social media populous (read more about the impact of this in _NAME_, 2016). The different forms of social media shame are diverse, some highly justified and consistent with the values of real life society, others exclusive to virtual etiquette and others seemingly trivial but still effective in 
evoking feelings of deep personal shame. The specific risks will be determined by the audience demographics and personal brand of each account. Here are just a few examples of topical social media shame risks: Coffee— To much bemusement, the subject of coffee has become a multi-faceted flash point for social media shame. One can unwittingly provoke shame feedback by sharing a post where they are holding a disposable cup, intergenerational shaming can be provoked by the perception older people have of irresponsible spending habits of millennials, and a thriving online community of ‘coffee snobs’ can call you out for your poor taste in the type of coffee you drink. In short, caffeinated social media posts are high risk these days. Travel —The value systems of tourism are also dynamic, complex and high risk for shame feedback. One can be shamed for not traveling enough, for traveling too much and damaging the environment, for traveling in a way that is perceived as culturally insensitive or socially unju
st, or traveling in a way that is perceived as unoriginal and too mainstream. Global crises —There is a constant threat of shame and guilt being perpetuated on social media in relation to environmental and human right crises, with the social media audience highlighting the unconscious ways one is perpetuating these disasters and personalising one’s responsibility for our unjust and endangered world. Shame ‘immunity’ through the personal brand In this high risk environment, social media makes us deeply aware of the space between how we see ourselves and how others see us. One way to respond to the high shame environment is to create shame ‘immunity’ through the personal brand (Rosario, 2015). This means you can maintain your honor and avoid shame by curating the perfect presentation of yourself by selectively sharing content that perpetuates positive fame and minimises exposure to shame. This is a direct reaction to replacing community with audience, becoming more performative in our behaviour, and 
less authentically relational. The cost is reduced connection with self and others as you must live up to your personal brand in the overlap of virtual and physical social spaces, and interact with others who are also presenting a brand instead of authentic self. This results in less authenticity, reduced depth of relationship and rising social anxiety."

Those are most of the problems I experience. I’ve been on invega for 8 years. originally I started out on sustenna then switched to trinza. I’m currently taking 546mg (156mg sustenna). I’ve tried lowering my dose several times but every time I tried something bad would happen, usually trouble controlling my anger due to my abusive family and hardships from my past. I spent time in a homeless shelter because I wasn’t getting along with my parents and also in a group home. Some big changes have happened in my life recently. I just got my own apartment and a EBT card. I have my own car but I never have the confidence to go out driving very often due to the invega. I used to drive all over the city and country before I was started on invega. I’m afraid if I try 
to lower my invega again the self interests of my family members particularly my older siblings and parents will conflict with my own interests to live the way I want to live. My parents have control over my SSDI and SSI. I’m waiting for the day I either become my own authorized rep payee or they pass away so I can become my own rep payee.

Then I run out of things to think about, and just sit there blankly. Then I feel as though I am being watched by aliens. It usually ends up the same way: I think they’re looking at their computers, which are giving them readings on what’s going in my head. Only their readings are telling them things that are not true, specifically that I am doing and thinking things that they are trying to get me to do and think, so I’m under their complete control. Then they mock me. Then I start thinking my own thoughts back at them, and make them curious enough to check on me visually. Then they see that I’m currently not under control, but they think I only broke out of it today. 
Then I print things from my email and bank account that prove I was doing things they did not think I could do long before they checked. Then they freak out and stop looking. Then once the feeling that I’m being watched goes away, I stop believing that aliens were ever doing this to me at all. I’d say that on most days, 80% of my waking hours is delusion-free and 20% is spent with alien delusions. It ebbs and flows. Also, none of these symptoms come until I run out of things to do or think about and just sit there aimlessly. How psychotic am I in your opinion?"

176198321,And that is why you got your dx?
176198322,"_PERSON_ - _PERSON_. Such love of the past. 2020, don’t throw it away."
176198323,Thanks dude. 499494
176198324,Yeah. That would help a lot. Too bad
174393248,Its very Un-PC but use the _USER_ID_ to your advantage. Its helped me in the past getting rid of low-lifes that think they can take advantage. No one wants to deal with an “baseball bat wielding psychotic Schizophrenic” . It maybe total sterotypical bollox - but its certainly helped to piss off the aggresive types ive encountered. See what i mean?? Especially in Pub culture at least.
176198325,"Of course I don’t disclose my full position here. I’ve made it clear that I’m a religious person, and religion is forbidden on this site. Isn’t that simple to understand? Why question it?"

176198327,"One afternoon, after the appointment with my 2nd psychiatrist, I was walking in the big city feeling that everyone knew my diagnosis and what I am thinking. That was TB but lasted not much"

176198329,Sigh you’re wrong… offensive too at the least
174393240,Any idea on how it works for those with TD? I need something that isn’t clozapine!
176198330,Well actually though is important to note for some people they are very habit forming
176198331,after attacking daily with thoughts that meds going to hurt me with their side effects even kill me i decide to take them as prescribed it was hard decision believe me but i made it!
176198332,"o the vicious cycle, do nothing as all your responsibilities pile up on you. and then spend your time thinking about what i doing. personally, i have optimistic thoughts of the things i may do haha if i can ever get around to it. but surely i’ll wait until monday to start the week fresh with magical good habits haha"
176198333,"I don’t really deal with terrible anxiety, just mild, but I still can’t work full time. I tried to take care of my grandmother in law after she had surgery, and that was really really tough. I started having a lot more symptoms after a week and a half of doing that every day. And since it was my grandma I spent most of the day just sitting on her couch playing on my phone or trying to read. So not really that stressful. But it was still too much."
176198334,"Yes, exactly. Do not focus in on those thoughts. Thoughts turn into Beliefs - Beliefs turn into Actions - Actions turn into Way of Life."
176198335,"Maybe find things that define you more as an individual than as a mom. I mean, being a mom is everything. But it’s important to have fulfilling lives beyond that as well. What do you like to do? Who are you as a person not just as a mom? It’s good to go on that journey and discover that."
176198336,Couldnt give a flying toss about it. It just a marketing speil these days to flog half dead red roses at extortionate prices. (Christ ive turned into a miserable old git) lol.
176198337,So I am celibate and most men dont take to well to it none of them do but I’m happy with my choice I think I will be alone for a long time. I’m finding that I have alot of triggers and my paranoia gives me a hard time talking to people but overall I’m good. I would probably flip out and hurt someone if they slept with me. So again I’m glad I’m celibate.

I don’t really know if I care anymore, diagnoses are just words. I found a pill that makes me normal, and as long as I keep taking it, I’ll be fine."
176198340,I got hit by a car! … I was walking into work and one of my coworkers was speeding to get home because she forgot her badge to get in. My son’s father had just dropped me off and I was walking in the building when… BAM she hit me… I had just finished my womenly cycle about two weeks before but the trauma from being hit shocked it into restarting prematurely and we conceived about two weeks after. If I hadn’t gotten hit we wouldn’t have conceived when we did. True story. Weird huh?

176198347,Are you feeling better _AT_MENTION_? Have you gotten any relief? Hmm…a possible allergic reaction to food or meds?
176198348,Mine was like that also. I thought one of my neighbors was spying on me through the wall laughing and copying everything I do.
176198349,"New rule: stop using self-deprecating humor. I know it’s very popular, but when you jokingly call yourself an idiot day after day, it wears on your self esteem. You’re not an idiot. You’re an awesome person and your mistakes and illness do not define your worth."
176198350,Sounds like a solid book and good read.
176198351,"If you have ‘magical thinking’ and are very suspicious but not delusional or pscyhotic, then you are likely to get schizotypal. They consider people who wear black all the time and think people ‘notice them’ or are ‘watching them’ to be candidates for schizotypal, especially if they think you take things ‘very personally’. The SPQ questionnaire is kind of dumb I think. They will eventually add ‘bipolar with psychotic features’ if your mood changes very much and then you wind up on meds for life… I’m sure a lot of schizotypals wind up sz or sza."

176198355,"I don’t know about Akathesia. About once every six weeks, I get four or five days of Restless Leg Syndrome when I lie down to sleep. Cogentine works great for that. Also, I am taking a huge assortment of nutrients (vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, happy bacteria). The nutritional support I get supposedly helps with the sideeffects of my several medications. I do well."

174393261,You shouldn’t take Abilify _AT_MENTION_ You know what it did to you. Do not think about drugging your parents. This could lead you straight to prison for a long time. You need to start taking some small steps. Force yourself out of your room for a couple of minutes at a time. Ignore your brothers when they do mean things to you. Start taking some control over your life. You may never find hat perfect medication.
176198360,This is true. 1515
176198361,For me this works- Simply turn it around and love yourself for the way you do things. I gain an insight to who I am .Also love other people for the way they do things.

176198368,It probably is _AT_MENTION_. I’m starting to learn to unwire from my delusions. It’s hard calling them that. I’m on a higher dose of Haldol so that might be helping.

176198377,"They only keep people in those places here when absolutely necessary. It costs them too much to keep you indefinitely. If you want out, behave yourself and try not to get into any arguments with other patients or doctors. Trying to escape is also pretty pointless, as they’ll just restrain you and give you a shot. If your together enough, this should be pretty straight forward, and you won’t be there long…"
174393251,"I used to be very anti-drug and scared of side effects. Now I know you just have to find the right medicine that works for you without side effects. Everyone is different and effected uniquely by various antipsychotics. Abilify works very well for me, but might not work for someone else. You shouldn’t give up the search for an antipsychotic that works for you."
176198378,"Are you going off meds? 1mg is quite low, light maintenance right?"
176198379,3/7 I took my dogs out for a walk and I ended up being followed by hallucinations. They were telling me to harm myself and throw myself off of a cliff. I just keep hurting the end of my finger because I just can’t ignore the hallucinations. Bugs are crawling.

176198387,Good job _AT_MENTION_. Once per week I eat 1400 calories instead of 1200. That helps me fit in a piece of pizza or something. And it boosts the metabolism to eat a few extra calories once per week.
176198388,I’m sorry for your loss.
176198389,Why you want to be hard on yourself? Be anything. Nobody is right.
176198390,Hmmm I get embarrassed after usually I believe everything when it happens although I’m pretty sure I don’t have mental illness anymore!! I’m gonna ask my doctor to take me off meds! The reason I feel I’m cured is becuase I was on high doses of two antipsychotics years ago and still had delusions and hallucinations and fast forward to now and I’m on a low dose of haldol and I’m completely fine ! Hmmmm maybe my doctor will slowly taper me off I don’t know haha

176198392,"My parents always believed what other people told them about me, never moving on their own. So we never talked. You’re one step ahead of me because, at least, there is conversation. So you just have to practice saying, “That’s not true.”."

Eighty-seven participants with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and matched healthy controls were assessed at baseline and follow-up. FEP participants were sub-grouped based on negative symptom items from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-R) with either no, mild, transitory or sustained symptoms over one year. Following an overall MANOVA, groups were compared on cognitive domains and a cognitive composite using ANOVAs. Cognitive course was explored with a MANOVA. We found a group effect on cognition. Participants who sustained negative symptoms were s
ignificantly outperformed by participants with no negative symptoms on executive functions and processing speed, and by those with mild or transitory symptoms on verbal learning and memory. Participants with sustained negative symptoms performed significantly poorer on the cognitive composite than those with no or mild negative symptoms. The group with no negative symptoms did not differ significantly from healthy controls on any cognitive measure, and the groups did not differ in cognitive course. Early course of negative symptoms is associated with cognition and could guide clinicians when evaluating need for cognitive assessment."

So what use would they have for me? Anyone have any input regarding this? It’s just I think I have trauma from this which gives me fear anyway."
174393264,"Basically all scientific papers have thorough discussions throughout of potential biases and misinterpretations. That’s how science moves forward, and how we know we can trust the conclusions when the picture as a whole becomes clear, as it has in this case. It’s a mistake to think we can point out a few shortcomings in scientific papers and then conclude that the truth is unknowable and that all opinions are equal. The part about drug use and violence is important because it shows schizophrenia and MI themselves are inconsequential when it comes to violence and homicide. It is not necessary to differentiate between drugs to show this, and so it is not a weakness or bias that they were grouped together, and there are other studies that have attempted to differentiate between them."

I know it’s easier to hang onto the feeling that you have to fight the rules they put on you, but it will be much easier for you if you try to understand they are doing that to help you.

176198433,"They caused my reflection to shape shift into various things. One was alien grey looking face, then they turned one of my legs into a dragon’s foot. I could see it in the reflection as a dragon’s foot but when I looked down it was my own foot. They have caused my reflection to be a long slender black figure as well as dark gray. They have physically caused my face to shape shift into a specific actor’s face as well. Not only did they change it but I saw and felt the shifting of my cells and the new face they generated (which was a male actor). It was 150% real and like _AT_MENTION_ said can’t be refuted by science until absolute evidence/proof is conducted in relation to other dimensions, life forms, beings/entities, and spirits."
176198434,"I take the Invega Sustenna 156mg monthly injection and I have the same problem. Low volume, low libido, sexual dysfunction. I’m used to it now and masturbate about once per month. Even though I have morning erections and have some sensation the volume is still low. I also used to watch porn once or twice a week which was damaging me after I did some research on the effects of porn on the brain. I was exposed to porn when I was about 9 and then got addicted around high-school. I didn’t realize how bad it was until about 6 months ago. My depression and anxiety are completely gone since I stopped watching porn. I also recommend you do the same if you watch porn."

I do remember back the the 12 months before my psychosis started, I was watching some dating advice videos (back in 2006) and they made me feel like I could do anything, like a massive dopamine hit. Maybe that is where it started for me."
174393276,I didn’t have these thoughts on Abilify bcz Abilify normalizes dopamine instead of blocking it. Blocking it helps a bit but normalizing it is better for me as I have no symptoms.

174393274,"We are all being broadcasted. Humans naturally broadcast at a certain frequency but not far. People in the community have taken advantage of this and you have become a human antenna broadcasting on radio waves. These are sound and picture. There are certain ways to listen to the voices. Some call it the spirit wind. Others are more technical about it and have antennas on their roofs. They aren’t the same as normal antennas. Stacked antennas, yaggi antennas… their is a whole list. They can pick up the voices and your voice being carried with it. Human transmitting frequency can be that close to radio frequency. HAM RADIO AND AMATEUR RADIO, prey on people until they start broadcasting, they amplify it. Magnetic fields etc are used.

But, who has this kind of energy and time? It did take away all of my positive symptoms and did wonders for my illness. However, it made me pre-diabetic and a heart attack waiting to happen. Clozapine also was effective but was a hassle with its mandatory blood draws. I like Abilify and will stay on it."
176198463,"To explain what my voices are like it’s as follows… Some people hear voices outside their head and some inside. In my case the voices of _PERSON_ (male) and _NAME_ (female) are inside my head. They are not literally audible but silent yet also clear. They sound like inserted thoughts but conversational not just thoughts. They are not my thoughts but spirits in my head. Having silent yet clear conversations about me and with me. And I can sense when they laugh or whisper or scream. Does it still qualify as voices if it’s silent “inserted thought-conversations”? How’s your voice experiences? Also to talk of something else, I feel sometimes when making eye contact with others that they can read my mind. That my thoughts are made audible to them. Like thoughts can escape thru my head via my eyes. Is this thought broadcasting or something else?"
174393288,Oh sorry to hear that _AT_MENTION_
174393287,I’m sorry you feel rough. Schizophrenia can really determine your day. I had a night of no sleep last night. Kept thinking about how much I don’t fit in with my family. Now today I’m tired but my mind is still in overdrive

In the board & care home two years ago I came back early to my room after lunch only to find that one of the residents from another building was in my neighbors room directly across the hall with my neighbors laptop under his arm and looking through their drawers. I wrestled a short while with the idea if I should report him or not to the staff. It didn’t take long, I waited 15 minutes and then reported him and they kicked him out because he was doing it to other people too. I never liked him anyways even though I had little contact with him. I didn’t like the way he looked. Just looking at him irritated me."

176198476,"_PERSON_, it sounds like he’s taking a different route than normal. He might be more concerned than you think, and he’s trying to reassure you while treating you. The lack of enjoyment that might come back is more common than you think. I’m not sure on the experimental medication which is why I say he’s taking a different route than normal. The treatment might not fix what you want with the timetable you want. It may take time. I wish you best of luck!"
176198477,"Ok, I think many of us would still prefer access to alternatives to standard psychiatry and pills, psych wards, and all that sort of treatment.

In usa i mean. Likely things are different in socialist systems. Wheras in usa some have socialist and some pay out of pocket or cant payy, so its all over the place what can happen."

I may at some point switch to a vegetarian form but for now I’m taking fish oil and I like it. My mind is so much clearer and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was helping my depression too because this is the first winter I’ve had the fish oil in my system and it’s the first winter I haven’t had terrible depression. I was still depressed a little, but not as much. Of course there were other changes too, so I don’t think the fish oil explains everything, but I think it’s possible it helped. Anyway I’m impressed enough that I will always supplement with some form of omega 3 forever and I will always recommend it to others in whatever form they’re comfortable taking."

174393293,"No, but i have noticed that some AP’s, in my case Olanzapine, worsens my thought disorder. But i have to take an AP because of depression. I have chosen abilify, it increases my thought disorder a little, but not as bad as Olanzapine and it helps with my suicidal thoughts."

174393289,"There are some treatments for some like firemonkey said, but nothing has worked for mine and I continue to smoke too."
176198531,when i first smoked i stole a pack and went in this field near a busy street even in ‘63. I smoked a couple ‘Springs’ and got sick and didn’t smoke again until i was 19. Quit cold turkey after 11 years. One of the best things I ever did. Nothin’ tied around my neck dragging me down. It was hard I got mad I almost lost myjob. But I quit them dastardly things.
174393296,It’s a pill. But it’s not really for negative symptoms. It’s selling point is a low side effect profile.
176198532,"thanks _AT_MENTION_ , I already calorie count, but I cant shed off any pounds"
174393301,Antipsychotics is like a temporary lobotomy. It reduces positive symptoms by creating negative and cognitive symptoms in some especially if dosage is more. Lobotomy causes severe negative and cognitive symptoms and there is no way to revert. This is why APs are better than it.

176198537,"_AT_MENTION_ , I have been researching it, and yesterday I found in some patients it can lower serotonin so its good for people with social anxiety. Other patients, it raises serotonin. I suppose everyone’s brain is different even with supplements. When chemicals touch neurotransmitters, everyone is going to have a different response, because of their genes and brain structure."

174393302,"Its dubbed a third generation antipsychotic, which is good because though its technically an atypical (2nd generation) AP, it does act quite differently from what I understand. But for me, even the max dose of abilify just makes me tired and though it probably does help a little -might as well be a sugar pill (for me)."

176198544,This is as bad as I’ve heard so far
176198545,_AT_MENTION_ I sometimes stare at the wall frozen and empty my mind and let it rest without even the simple demands of life like interaction or thinking. This is needed every day. Sometimes I spend some time online. Sometimes I practice mindfulness while I gaze on something like nature. Sometimes I kayak alone in nature. I am often alone all day from my family doing regular life so I am able to. Usually I spend much time inactive between absolutely required tasks like errands for my family. I have problems with feeling stuck or frozen while every task feels extremely difficult.

176198554,"is he a counselor or a therapist or a pdoc? I’ve heard that schools are changing to address childhood trauma, and they are doing it sensitively since young ones may not understand they’ve been violated. I volunteered to watch kids while mothers took classes on parenting. I felt real good about that. Anything I can do to help stop any form of abuse, I’m all for that. anyway, as far as you getting sz from this, it very well could be, if not major mental illness, then an addiction."

I think if you’re well treated on your medication the likely hood of a break is going to be lower. When you start having bleed through problems maybe then you should be concerned. Please bring up your concerns with your care provider, I had it explained to me a bit, and I stopped worrying about it so much.

Yet, the associations among the orexin system, weight changes and the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients remain uncertain, especially in inpatients with chronic schizophrenia (CS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the orexin-A levels, body mass index (BMI) and clinical symptoms of CS inpatients.Methods: Altogether, 324 inpatients were enrolled in our study. The clinical symptoms of all inpatients were measured using a 30-item Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and then we calculated the BMI of each subject and 
tested the orexin-A levels by _NAME_ methods.Results: The orexin-A levels of the CS inpatients in the obesity group (1.24?±?1.45?ng/ml, n?=?52) were significantly higher than those in the non-overweight group (0.85?±?1.18?ng/ml, n?=?176) and the overweight group (0.97?±?1.15?ng/ml, n?=?96). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that higher BMIs were associated with higher plasma orexin-A levels and fewer negative symptoms. Furthermore, the multiple regression analysis indicated that the orexin-A level could be a contributor to BMI (F?=?30.21, p?"

Dissociation, I think, refers to when someone is experiencing something traumatic, they psychologically remove themselves from the situation, even though they can’t physically. I, as a child, dissociated from my trauma to the point where in my 20’s, I had no memories of it. It becomes a coping mechanism that trauma survivors get used to using or have no control over.

If my body dies and my memories and my personality disappears, what is left? Personally, I don’t think I am my memories or my personalities. It’s just a room for my consciousness to fill. I am something else. I don’t know if I am the same thing from one second to the next, or if I’m different from others, or apart from others.

I know this is a challenge for a lot of schizophrenics, but I really recommend finding books that interests you and aren’t triggering. The library and people who work there are a great resource to find enjoyable literature. To keep myself distracted from voices while I read I keep my radio on at a low volume while I read. Sometimes I start five or six different books at once, and I’ll stick with one that holds my interest. I try hard to only eat fast food about a couple times a month. Home cooked meals are cheaper and often more filling and taste better. And I exercise every two days for at least 20 to 30 minutes.

176198677,My voices (Alien) threatens to use me to kill my loved ones. He inserts his fantasy into my head and tries to make me to believe I’m evil. But he is. But over the years I’ve come to realise he’s just blowing hot air and I don’t have to obey him. Still it’s scary though - especially when he threatens to take over. I can literally feel the shift and I’m terrified I’d lose my mind to him. Fortunately a higher dose of amisulpride helps!

I have been talking to this guy in town via email for the last couple of years but I was always scared of going back to work so I never said yes. Now I have gone back to work but am struggling to keep my job so I told him I would do it. He said in 2020 he might have something so I will be doing it for money. I have a drone in my garage I have never taken out of its box. Maybe I should fly it.

I stay between 1200-1400 calories a day, and I’ve lost 19 pounds so far. I use their nutrition tracker to plan my meals and make sure I’m staying within my ranges. It doesn’t take that long to do. I’ve seen excellent results so far. I only take 7.5 mg of Zyprexa though, it may be a lot harder at 30 mg. I was on 10 mg for a little while, but my pdoc and I discovered that 7.5 mg is my lowest effective dose."

176198688,"Almost all loud songs have romantic inappropriate messages, where I live. Like im trying to sleep tonight and there’s music outside my window. But i know im a stronger man. i wont give into lust or a lack of self-control. I think im just going to play my own, more appropriate, music; to drown out the music outside my window. Nighttime is the roughest time to counter unsolicited romantic inappropriate content, I feel. The couple upstairs make noises at night. sometimes they even play romantic inappropriate music. If i were the landlord, i’d kick those tenants out! And its not cool that people blame men for their lack of self-control, when those same people are subjecting men to inappropriate romantic messages without those men’s consent. Like honestly, there’s barely any single place in my city where i can escape from romantic inappropriate music from radios. To counter unsolicited sexuality, I explore antisexuality. Antisexuality is a hate or opposition against sexual activity. Such hate he
lps counterbalance the unsolicited promotion of sex within my city and from businesses of sexual exploitation. I hate sex. Sex grows diseases, disrespects homosexuals, allows discrimination, perverts gender, facilitates rape, kills mothers and babies, and enslaves women."

I was always of the opinion that there was something “bad” about those suffering from mental illness, so when I was advised to seek help I was surprised. The doctor came round to my flat and gave me some pills. I took them and continued taking them until it culminated in me falling out the second floor of a house and bashing my head against a car on my way down. I was then rushed to the nearest psychiatric hospital. Fast forward 12 years and I’m still on the medication."

He says covid was created on purpose to make money etc that they already had covid cure since they created covid. He says vaccines are used to control ppl’s minds and to plant spying microchips in ppl. I dont get him, he doesn’t have any mental illness and is fully functional and working 2 jobs."

176198699,"It began for me when I was 20. I was living in London with my brother and began feeling strange. Later I went off to a relatives house where I ended up falling out of the window and hitting the ground. I was rushed off to hospital, then to a psychiatric hospital. The medication has been a big problem for me, because of the side effects. Even now I make a humming noise while I eat which is horrible and I put it down largely to the drugs [medication]. I am 31 and currently trying to learn how to code via edX’s CS50 but finding it very difficult. One of the problem sets you have to solve includes printing a Pyramid using the hash [#] symbol and it is incredibly complex. Even now I’m not sure I understand it. Anyway, looking forward to getting my medication lowered, I previously tried lowering Amisulpride yet that didn’t work, so hopefully with Clopixol it will. I take Niacin in addition to the medication and while I don’t notice a lot of difference at the moment, you need to give these things

Keep on keeping on and glad that even when stressed you don’t even think of the drugs…It’s hard to let go of those feelings and I think your life is so much better for your sobriety. Well done _AT_MENTION_ . Amazing achievement.

176198716,"Hello _AT_MENTION_ . I think that you and your parents should not be afraid of society. Accept your situation and don’t hide it, I tell both you and your parents. Of course, disease may take your life earlier than you would want to go. However, you should have a positive mindset and believe that you will live a long a meaningful life, and even hope for possible cures for your conditions some time in the future. Such an attitude has several advantages: It increases the chances that you will indeed survive a long time because your thoughts affect reality. It helps you make the most of your life, because it is very difficult to lead a successful life if you are afraid that at any moment you may die. In concert with this approach, you should try to fight your muscular atrophy by engaging in strength training if possible and fight your mental illness by finding solutions for it( if you want I can list things that work for me). So, to sum up, you should have a positive mindset and prepare for a struggl

174393358,"There’s a big thread about Amyloban 3399 on this forum here: Amyloban 3399 (Lion's Mane) discussion It has helped like half a dozen people on this forum, including me. We’re grizzled schizophrenia vets who know when something is mere placebo and when it’s actually effective. _AT_MENTION_ takes it too, and he’s been around the forum for a long time. It’s either working by reducing neuroinflammation or healing nerve damage. I believe it’s the first. This Daily Essential Nutrients thing is new though, and the studies aren’t huge, but there’s at least one 91-person study that shows it works for the anxiety levels that earthquake survivors experienced. 74% of people who took it showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, versus 20% of the control and 43% of a different formulation. It seems to be good for general mental health disorders. I definitely am glad to have taken it, 31 days and counting. It’s like my brain is going back to normal. I have zero ves
ted interest in vouching for this stuff. I don’t make a red cent doing so."
174393371,"Well _AT_MENTION_, I was trained in the area of investments, trading and financial risk management. I was also licensed. I knew what to do and what not to do. All of that was before the onset of schizophrenia in my 40s. I had a portfolio worth around $1000000 that I managed. Once I was put on Abilify I lost all fear of losing in a trade and could only see the potential win and I disregarded all of the risk management methods I had learned and ceased to apply them. Abilify turned me into a gambling junkie that kept looking for riskier and riskier trades until all my money was gone. I didn’t realize what happened until I learned about the Canadian Abilify gambling class action law suit which I joined. I now firmly believe that anyone living with schizophrenia should be required to have a professional trustee manage all or most of their money until certain requirements are met that should include being in the recovery phase for a period of time."
176198790,"Today’s pandemic issue was that I got to drive my wife to several different stores and wait in the parking lot while she went inside. They are still asking people to shop by themselves without family and kids when possible, and I’m in the vulnerable cohort so I have to avoid the stores. Would rather my wife just went out on her own as sitting in the parking lot by myself just makes the experience more miserable."

If it were me I would try a very low dose first and start from there because they have side effects. For me they cause very bad withdrawl and it is awful trying to lower the dose.

176198816,i think married without kids. I have a very few people in my life to compare this too. I don’t have a big social aspect. I think if you find the right person. Being married would be wonderful. you still could have and persue your own goals and activities but grow as a couple. after that i would say being single. i really enjoy kids a lot but i think they are stressful on a marriage and money wise expensive and i think too you can’t pursue any of your own hobbies because you take care of the kids. But i am single and have never had kids so i’m sure it might be a different aspect to it.

174393377,"Ok so think of dopamine channels as being doors. A full antagonist means the door is completely closed. These are what older antipsychotics are. The issue with the door being fully closed is that we NEED dopamine for things like motor skills, so people end up getting issues like tardive dyskinesia and even parkinsonism. So, they invented the partial agonists. For these meds, the door is open, but only a little bit, so some dopamine can still get in but not the huge flood that’s normally present in psychosis. That way we get the dopamine we need to prevent motor disorders, while preventing things like worsening of negative symptoms and the motor disorders I mentioned. Theoretically anyways. Sometimes these even still block too much dopamine depending on the individual and what amount they need."

The second shot will trigger that immune response, which is a good thing. AstraZenica is a very safe vaccine, the small number of reported bad reactions (clots) are so few that they are outliers statistically. More likely to be from a bad batch than it being a bad vaccine.

I got married and my wife was a similar caregiver for her family. It really helps if you think of how you can make your entire family prosper because unless they are total holes they will probably help you back in return if they can.

Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates) interacts with SULFORAPHANE Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Sulforaphane might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications. Taking sulforaphane along with some medications that are changed by the liver might increase the effects and side effects of some medications. Before taking sulforaphane talk to your healthcare provider if you take any medications that are changed by the liver.

176198917,"Among those that I have tried the best antipsychotic is by far Trevicta, in the United States it is Invega trinza.It’s 10 spans above the others. At first it is difficult to bear because of the numbness it gives you, but after two years you dance for how much better! Trevicta always changes a stationary level in the samgue and this reduces the side effects and improves the benefits. Trevicta is a case of how pharmacokinetics (stationary levels) influence pharmacodynamics (how the drug works). When protecting the pharmacodynamics of a drug, not only the receptors on which it acts, but also the signaling pathways that from the downstream controlled receptors are important. Well, trevicta has a different pharmacodynamics than invega. As for time, it takes 2 years / 2 and a half years to get the maximum benefits."

176198939,"As far as the topic of this post, I’ve been doing a lot of studying on the work of a man named _PERSON_. There’s a concept known as “bicameralism” rooting from the terminology meaning “two chambers” meaning the right and left hemisphere. I won’t get too far into detail but the theory states that before humans have conscious thought the way we do now. Our brains were split and operated on a relatively simple instinct only basis. Now operating solely off instinct would be dangerous as society and language began to form. So over time the brain developed a way of communicating with itself that could help ensure the survival of the unit. _PERSON_ estimates this communication from one side of the brain to the other was hallucination. Take for example the Greek story the Iliad. In the story the main character interacts with a pantheon of gods relating to certain situation. Much like in sz the same hallucinations dealing with the same issues. Some other examples occur throughout humanities hi
story in many different cultures. All kinds of people claimed contact with gods and other beings containing greater knowledge then themselves. The argument is again, maybe it wasn’t gods at all. Just the right hemisphere sending messages in a way it thought it would be listened to. People who were sensitive to hearing these “gods” or quick to hallucinate had a survival advantage because they received frequent messages from the right hemisphere. Making them good leaders in a time where answers weren’t so clear. So the frequent hallucinators became Shamans and Priests, because they were more in touch than the rest of humanity. From this, I draw the belief that Sz is a type of handed down trait that is simply out of date. Since it has a physical component, being brain architecture, it will take a long time to phase out. As for our role, I believe it would be whatever you can make it, given the… Special nature of our reality. As for the role of our sz ancestors… I think it would be that. Early leaders
hip positions."

176199067,I used to think this as I thought it is too difficult and complicated to divorce need it be but I changed my mind. I want to marry my boyfriend and be in a faithful committed loving happy relationship. He wants prenup and I will not be in his will at all because everything goes to his sons. I’m fine with that but he might not inherit that much from me then. Not that I have much at the moment. I have so much to be thankful for but not much to inherit me. I want to become catholic so I can be in sacred Union with my boyfriend. He said we can talk about marriage when we have been together a year but he will get me to sign papers and we will have separate economy and not shared and I will not get anything at all from him. That’s fine. I even gave him $10 yesterday to buy food I was cooking for him. My x was going to have me in his will to get his house and dogs etc . He was a great partner and it was the most loving peaceful home I ever had and I adore his dogs and him but he wouldn’t let me go ve
gan and we didn’t have sex hardly ever. I’m not after my boyfriends money nor was I after my x money so if he wants me to sign papers sure. I really want to marry but just last year I did not want to marry because too much beauracracy and too complicated. I changed my mind. How would you want your wedding to be ish? Dress? Religion? Place? Guest list?

176199096,Have you considered speaking with a psychologist? You seem to indicate earlier in the thread that you have some extra money you don’t technically need.
176199097,"Have you considered custodial work? It has a few advantages over many other jobs. For one thing, it isn’t that physically hard, another thing is it’s fairly easy to learn. You might find a place like mine and get to work alone most of the time. And with this COVID-19 most of the workers are working at home and I’m working uninterrupted in almost empty buildings. I don’t know if you could find the same set-up I have, but custodial work is usually the same at most workplaces. Sweeping, mopping, cleaning restrooms etc. I only work 17 hours a week with paid lunch of course and a 15 minute break. I think Federal minimum wage is $10 and hour right now; I make $16.00 an hour."
176199098,"Probably not this year. Your psych doctor likely has an end of the year bonus if a number of patients being treated personally remain away from emergency rooms and or psychiatric holds whom have been following orders as prescribed in comparison with those who have had trouble receiving their medications through the mail due to the current state of affairs. I’d imagine you try to follow your treatment plan likely for certain behaviors you have no control over and thus you take medications for. Such as erratic thinking and lashing out verbally when feeling “anxiety” as many seem to refer to irritability as. So your doctor will likely not lower the dosage this year so as not to risk the chances of physical acting out of irritability thus the possibility of having a patient ruin the statistic of remaining out of a psychiatric hold and or emergency call. And likely in lieu of my verbose statement, your provider will agree upon lowering the dosage. Personally, I believe you are ready to lower dosag
e if you feel you have the discipline as you obviously have the maturity to refrain from lashing out on this forum. In any case, I am supportive of your plight. I think for the most part you are a kind individual that does not react well to deceptive behaviors. I should add, my medical expertise is that of a patient and not a psychiatrist."

174393454,"Overall , the combination of negative and positive symptoms. My schizophrenia spectrum symptoms have always been at the comparatively mild end of that spectrum. There are some cognitive symptoms that are primarily explained by the ASD. As someone replied to me on another forum: Mate, you’re autistic*. This means that you’re likely to do really well in some things and really badly in others. NTs tend to be the same across the board. So (blunt language sorry) a smart NT will be smart at everything, a stupid NT will be stupid at everything, an average NT will be average at everything. That’s why most NTs are just average at everything. Or maybe slightly above or below but not likely to be disabled by not knowing or be a savant by knowing. Aspies/autistic people have specialist areas where we’re really smart and then aren’t good at the rest of it. Socially I don’t do well.I’ve always been fairly asocial, and failed attempts at socialising have increased that."

Taking as much as 1,000 milligrams of B-12 isn’t necessarily dangerous, but it won’t help you either since the body absorbs only a small amount. [1] Because your body has only so much intrinsic factor, you can absorb only a certain amount of B-12 at a time. This is why the vitamin is considered safe, even at high doses. [1] It’s unclear how much you’ll absorb from a 1,000-microgram supplement since the absorption rate decreases so much with larger doses. Depending on the amount of available intrinsic factor in your system, you might not absorb much more than 10 micrograms.

I went to drivers training when i was 16 and hallucinated behind the wheel and almost got into an accident, for example i had a moment where i put my blinkers on to go left and i was in the left turn lane and the voices told me to go right so i did and could have potentially gotten hit by another car.

I know, what’s so special about me, but when you hear the tv talking about you and everywhere you go you hear people talking about you what else do you do.

I contacted brother to talk things over in a good way.

176199224,I was a drug dealer and my girlfriend died because of me. Not directly but because I got her into the lifestyle. She was clean for a couple of years. I kicked her out because she started using again and I couldn’t be around it. A couple years later she was found dead in Detroit with a bullet between her eyes. I quit using because I got severe psychosis. Anytime I used it was instant psychosis for a couple of days. It’s been 20 years and I haven’t dated since. Women flirt with me all the time but I have no desire to date again. I feel a piece of me died with her. We were together since 8th grade.

I think it becomes a problem when you try to do it yourself without any experience with changing the doses. I know the mental health system is under the pump but If you’ve done this before I think it would be ok…but you need to let your doctor know you’ve done it which you have tried to do.
176199254,Sorry you experienced that
176199255,"The difference is that you had no power over your friend. If _PERSON_ had gone out with a group of friends one night and asked one of them for a hug, and she said no, that would be the end of the story. Imagine it like this. You have a job. It is your first real Adult job ever in your life. When you and your boss are alone, he asks to borrow $20. You don’t want to give him $20. You brought that money to get lunch, and if you give it away, you will be hungry all day. But you know that if your boss decides he doesn’t like you, he could tell everyone in your field of work how terrible you are as an employee. You would never get another job in your field again, and you would have to either go back to school for something different, or else work a much lower paying job for the rest of your life. So you give him the $20, and just stay mad about it, until you find 5 other employees who felt forced to give him $20. You feel there is safety in numbers, so you all go to HR together to file a complaint ab
out your boss. You know that with 5 other people to back up your story, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously. Now imagine you’re hanging out with a buddy. He asks if he can borrow $20. You tell him no, you only have enough for lunch and you don’t want to go hungry. Your buddy says okay, and you both continue hanging out."
176199256,"Your problems might grow over time and your symptoms can change, but however sympathetic we might be about the challenges of arriving at at correct diagnosis, the hard fact remains that if you’re diagnosed with X, only to be told later on that you never suffered from X but from Y, you were misdiagnosed when told you had X."

And plus at this point I don’t feel competent enough and I feel too broken to actually work like that ever. My mom grew up real poor actually, my dad grew up just as I did, but he was very successful in life, probably well he didn’t have sz and my dad is from a different time period where expectations were different and stuff and idk. So when I was born my dad never questioned how he should raise me. He thought everything would be alright I think just on blind faith kind of living in a bubble. And my mom Wanted to give me stuff That she didn’t have as a kid. My parents forgot to forecast that life doesn’t end at 17 years old. It seems that way to me at least. And I have tons of anxiety and paranoia. Ughhhhhhh At this point I’d rather be homeless than the idea of having to fend for myself at this age and make enough money and whatnot to stay afloat.

He has this weird style that I can’t describe and he’s slow. We take turns mopping since we only have one mop between us. So one guy always ends up just standing around doing literally nothing while watching the other guy mop. Like I said, there’s a billion worse things to worry about but everytime I watch him it just makes me want to walk up to him and grab him by the shoulders and shake him and say, “QUIT MOPPING SO SLOW AND MOP LIKE A NORMAL PERSON!!!”"

Take two large pieces of felt, probably 5-6 ft long, and sew them together on three sides, then buy the little 1 lb bags of dried beans from the grocery store, and measure them across. Sew lines down your blanket so you can slide the bags in at the top, in a row. Add a Velcro flap at the top. That way, you can remove the bags of beans when you need to wash the blanket. Bam, weighted blanket for $10 instead of $70 and you only need to know how to sew a straight line."

176199281,This time last year I was getting up and walk/running a mile every other morning. Now I’m going weeks without leaving the house. I don’t feel sad or depressed just kinda like who cares.

176199288,_AT_MENTION_ I understand what you’re saying. But I think I will adjust to it eventually.
176199289,True maybe that’s why my pdr never prescribed it. I have tried most meds available in Canada except Geodon. Also I just calculated the equivalent dosage is 70mg which is very close to the max dose so I will probably have side effects.
174393498,"That depends on you. You can choose to learn everything you can about your illness and work with a psychiatrist to control the illness rather than letting it control you – or not.

174393494,"Version:1.0 StartHTML:_PHONE_NO_ EndHTML:_PHONE_NO_ StartFragment:_PHONE_NO_ EndFragment:_PHONE_NO_ Re-reading that last post I’d have to agree that some of the phrasing clearly gives the reader the impression of impassioned text. It isn’t, I’m not having an “episode”, my mind is perfectly calm. Anyway, I’ve skimmed over the point twice now, but I think I should explain the “What” and the “How” in a little more detail. From the standpoint that I’m not bipolar-schizophrenic. What: Somehow, there’s a mummy and a daddy waiting to give birth. Somehow, I am a “daddy avatar”, but I had to find myself first, in order to find that out. Somehow, I’m supposed to meet the “mommy avatar”, look into her eyes, and if “BING!!!”, the “birthing process” can begin. How: The physically how could be accomplished in a number of ways, but I’m not sure which. The physics of how aren’t that hard to follow, so I’ll outline it for you. In a block universe, all time is present 
all of the time. _PERSON_ time – the smallest possible unit of time. The flow of time is an illusion specific to the “observer”. - Quantum Mechanics So, there’s a smallest possible amount of time, and in a block universe all time is present all of the time…Then an entire block universe can be contained within a _PERSON_ time. Space-Time could just be “a singularity of time”, the “Big Bang!” need never have happened. Remember, the flow of time is an illusion, so us “observers”, would be unaffected, whichever scenario ultimately proved to be correct. Now if you remember from way back, my biggest “want” is that you all succeed and are “born”, but how? A multiverse of all possible universes could help. _NAME_ dies, and within an hour I figured out: If _PERSON_ and _PERSON_’s “imaginary time” is there, and there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be. If “imaginary time” is stopped due to the gravitational forces within the singularity. If there never was a “Big Bang!”. The
n, Space-Time itself could be nothing but a “potential future singularity of time”, of a dimension of time that has stopped “ticking”. In layman’s terms, our Universe could be one of an almost infinite number of possible futures, for “imaginary time”. But “imaginary time” isn’t “ticking”. Which would of course mean, that everything that us “observers” observe, isn’t really there. Oddly, quantum physics has shown that to be the case. Matter only exists when it is “observed”. This bit isn’t physics, but what the physics has given me now is a time dimension “To be” in. That is to say; If I’m sentient in the block universe of space-time, why couldn’t another being be sentient in “imaginary time”? So I guess it might be possible that I’m some kind of “daddy avatar”. If “imaginary time” contains a multiverse of all possible futures, it also clears up that old conundrum: If a multiverse of all possible universes exists, and a universe that is not part of a mu
ltiverse is possible; How can both exist? Simple, the multiverse could be contained within the universe that cannot be part of a multiverse. This bit came much later: If “imaginary time” has “potential futures”, perhaps all matter has “a time property or properties”; Could it help explain why matter only exists when it is “observed”? After all, in a block universe with “observers”, matter only needs a where and a when to be observed. Then there’s the problem of “Spooky action at a distance”, which becomes easily understandable, if all that’s going on is you’re “observing” a given “time property” on one, they’re in-sync, it’s the same “time property” on both particles, so there was no need for “communication”. Call me crazy, but it just might work… Well, the physics bod’s don’t seem to be able to bash any holes in it anyway. I clearly cannot convince anybody here that I’m not having some kind of “manic episode”, and just typing in any old drivel tha
t comes to mind. Sad really, but to be expected. But, it’s been nice to finally tell someone at least some of what has been going on over the last eleven years. I’m at peace, content, happy… I found myself, but didn’t lose myself in the process. I’m in a block universe just going with the flow."

I fell asleep on the job. I also became hospitalized due to suicidality. I was fired from another nursing job working night shift. I rerouted medications from the patients supply. And was dumb enough to tell someone about it. I was fired from multiple part-time volunteer positions too numerous to mention.

Then all of a sudden about 3 weeks ago I started losing weight. I was reducing the size of my portions. I have now lost 20 pounds. I do go hungry between meals and sometimes my appetite is ravenous.

But I haven’t worked since 2009 and am med resistant and have chronic pain, but we never made a claim on the pain when I filed so I never got seen by a judge or disability doc. I did get a lawyer who didn’t have to go cause of course, denied at first. But day before court he got a letter dated a week prior that case was approved, no court appt for him. Guy got me a total of 18k in back pay for SSDI and SSI and kids back pay, I signed he gets 25% of it.

176199381,"Ask the doctor to lower your medicine, this depends on you, but if he actively hid the tests from you, or if he simply didn’t bring them to light to you, because you wouldn’t know how to interpret them, thats something you need to distinguish to yourself, and consult with whoever does his reviews if his conduct was within the normal. If so, you need to buck up and try to adapt to this. If it wasn’t normal, then he will probably be disciplined. There’s serious consequences for misconduct so be sure before you make claims because you don’t want to be at odds with the people helping you if you can get away with it."

176199384,"I’m trying to make sense of sadness that I’ve been feeling. I’ve been trying to make sense of why I’m crying. First of all, I’m imagining myself all alone with no one to be with. It’s not my mom- it’s about loneliness. I’ve been feeling so bad because I felt lonely. Also, I’m crying about missing my mom when my mom is across the room , sleeping right there. Second of all, I have to move out of my original family as an adult sometime. It’s a passage of life and I’m sure my mom and I will meet every year or so, or even talk on Skype every week or even every day. Anyway, after I cried yesterday, I started to have a fever that left me ill. After I got off Discord after a talk with some of the friends on this site, my mom came to see how I was doing. She put her hand on me and realized I was having a fever. I slept and woke up to my dog licking my entire face. So I’m thinking that my sadness is rather not based on anything that is happening in real life. It’s just my depression

What worked for me was AA, CA, and NA. Getting clean won’t solve all your problems but it will solve a big one. I hope this doesn’t sound like I’m making your problems trivial because that is far from my intention, but you will get through this like all the schizophrenics before you and all the schizophrenics after you. A lot of us were messes at some point in our lives but just co-operate with the doctors; use every resource the doctors and hospitals offer and things can get better. I’ve felt suicidal many times but it passes and I’m so happy I never attempted; tell the doctors your suicidal feelings, make sure they understand. They might hospitalize you and that’s no picnic but it is survivable. The biggest problem when I was hospitalized was that hospitals are so boring. Personally, every time I was hospitali
zed I tried to spend most of my time sleeping; they usually frown on that but I did it anyways. Everybody here has suffered but we survived and you can too.

It depends on what the job is. If it requires a lot of people, then yes i’d probably have to work part time. However, the job i’m going for is mostly a desk job, so i feel i’ll be able to handle it. Anyway, whenever he brings this sort of thing up, i feel uncomfortable. I just don’t like talking about my illness."

I know this is real, that was very concrete. Then as you pull yourself out of phycosis, your still left traumatized basically from the events and responses from yourself and others. So while your trying to convince yourself slowly it’s not real while putting on your best ‘normal’ game face, your trying not to react to those events and ect. I don’t if this makes sense lol sounded better in my thoughts. My point is there just so many little but big diffrent factors to the levels of disability in this illness and many different heartbreaks and healing aspects that place. It’s not easy. Not at all.

A worker there invited me to play on the church baseball team. I thought, “Why not?” So I was soon going to a couple of practices a week and it was OK. The season started and I learned the entire season consisted of 4 games! And we were a lousy team. We won one game and the scores on the other three games that we lost were all scores like 23-1. And 24-2. And 22-4. The most hilarious thing was that we made the play-offs! So we got to play a couple of extra games. We lost those badly too. The games were fun. I looked forward to them and I was pretty good at hitting but I hadn’t thrown a baseball in ten years and my arm was shot and one game I was playing third base and I couldn’t make the throw from 3rd to 1st."

It did happen, and the first years after were particulary hard considering they drugged me down and I had to adapt to a whole new way of life, a second rate life compared to the one I had pre meds. On the upside, over the years I learned to be much more humble, and appreciate what I got, and be kind to others. Sure I have a mental disease and have to take some unpleasant meds, but fact is that almost every human being is struggling with something, at least at some point in their life. If it’s not mental illness it’s something else. Crimby is right. We can’t see what other people are struggling with, just like when strangers look at me, they have no idea what my demons are."

That’s the truth here… I’ll continue having my somatics and I even wonder if they are not here partly because of the Zyprexa, but its not sure… I should finally accept my fate yeap… Continue with the meds and move more… Maybe my numbness from the meds is so present, cause I don’t have much social contacts and I am almost sedentary… Today I feel still a bit numbed by the 7,5 mgs. But this was a good dosage for me before… 10s were too much for me… Because of the negatives etc… I have an illness yeap, but its not a job to think, that you can die from it, so I take a proper dosage now… Ill try to fight for the rest in order to feel better, but I am not sure i’ll recover yeap… Its been three years that I am on Zyprexa.

Six years later a doctor suggested that I started the risperdal Consta injection and I said no I don’t want to change my good Clopixol with something that doesn’t work at all.

It’s not very common, but if you do have it, then it does explain why your symptoms are so… well… not psychotic."

174393566,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of N-acetylcysteine on clozapine-induced sialorrhea in schizophrenic patients: a case series. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, International clinical psychopharmacology , Nov 2019 15 Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic demonstrated to be superior in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Despite all this effectiveness, it has side effects that can be serious and bothersome. Sialorrhea is the most common adverse drug reaction that occurs during clozapine treatment. It is usually persistent, may impair the patient's quality of life and reduce treatment compliance. However, there is limited evidence to guide possible treatment strategies for sialorrhea. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant. It acts directly as a scavenger of free radicals, in particular oxygen radicals. The antioxidant NAC also modulates glutamatergic, neurotrophic and inflammatory pathways. The first time we examined and reported the effect of NAC (1200-2400?mg/day) on clozapine-induced si
alorrhea in a patient group of five patients. After four weeks of follow-up, the severity of sialorrhea decreased significantly with NAC augmentation. There were no significant side effects of NAC as measured by the UKU scale."

But the last two times I could recognize whos voices they were but still couldn’t make out full sentences. This suggests that that they are making their way through each time I get more and more stressed. Do you get faint voices _AT_MENTION_ ?
176199574,Yes. They’re so vivid.
176199575,Anybody have any thoughts on this transition I’ve been on it before the worse thing I experienced was hunger and tachycardia any input is appreciated… I’ve had restless legs since risperdone to abilify switch so I guess something sedating may help with this

176199578,"I told you before that you’re buying too many things and you’re not even working, tons of supplements, vape products, etc I had shopping addiction from Abilify but I didn’t steal, instead I had debts I couldn’t pay on my Visa, I told my parents and they accepted to pay them if I cancel my Visa. I stopped the Abilify and cancelled my Visa. I just have a debit card now. Haven’t had any issues with overspending since stopping Abilify 2-3 years ago. Off meds I also had some spending issues but not as bad as on Abilify. I think sz does brain damage which makes szics more easily addicted, impulsive and compulsive. I suggest you to seek therapy for your shopping addiction, its not just nicotine addiction as you buy many other things in big quantities like supplements."

176199585,"Yeah, if antipsychotic routes have been exhausted, it seems like diet, supplementation and lifestyle are the means of reducing symptoms. I am on this supplement called Daily Essential Nutrients by _NAME_ Nutritionals, and it’s really doing a good job reducing my brain inflammation and symptoms to where I am starting to feel more grounded and comfortable. If I recover in the next two weeks like I did in the past two weeks, I think I’ll be able to watch videos hallucination-free. They are FDA approved and have numerous studies showing its efficacy against various mental illnesses, so it’s pretty credible. It has a good track record in healing anxiety as well. Check out this link for more articles about it: https://www.hardynutritionals.com/blog/search/anxiety They have a 1 week supply if you just want to test it out and see if your anxiety goes down within that time. The changes happen pretty quickly. Aside from that, I’d suggest avoiding things that raise anxiety, like eating high fat, high 
sugar foods, and maybe trying to avoid wheat since that can break down the blood-brain barrier in susceptible individuals. Finally, minimize lifestyle stress if you can. It can damage the barrier if you are in a vulnerable state."

176199598,"So I’m vacuuming the gym and this really cute girl comes in. About 23 or 24 years old. I don’t want to stare but she was wearing skin tight sweats and a little t-shirt. So I looked a little and then IDK what happened but she was kind of stretching to warm up and man, she started acting real sexy. Showing off her body and me and her were the only ones in the gym. After a few minutes it stopped and I’m thinking how lucky I was. I mean these women soldiers aren’t innocent kids. Almost all of them are married and have a rug rat or two. But I was thankful for the show and I let her alone. I knew what to do, I should have just vacuuming and let her work out. Then she started putting big weights on a bar and I knew I should have kept my mouth shut and be thankful for the little show at my age. But I opened my big mouth and laughed and said. “You’re going to lift all that?”. I knew I blew it and she just acted like I wasn’t there. So I repeated it and got the cold shoulder. Things were cool 
until I opened my big mouth. A rookie mistake. You don’t talk to girls after something like that, it might embarrass them or spoil the mood, I knew better."

176199614,"Over the past few years I have taken an interest in anti-aging and aging reversal research and ideas, both from a biochemical point of view and a spiritual one. I believe there are people alive today who are hundreds if not thousands of years old. They have done this without biochemistry, however I think biochemistry has its place. As part of this interest, I have taken an interest in my parents’ health. However, the real question remains spiritual. Why am I interested in my parents’ health, is it purely a selfish desire to have them around to look after me forever;?; People have a right to move on, to forget the torments of the past, and to be reborn. Attachments can also be damaging if persisted in beyond the point of enjoyment and health. I have believed in a 120 year cut off for most of my life, and going beyond that requires some serious reconfiguring of my behaviour and beliefs. I am being tested now to see whether I can make the required changes. I have been so caught up in this that the 
test has manifested itself globally, at least from the perspective of a solipsistic world view. It is pointing the way towards several changes, like buying groceries for my parents, and looking after myself more independently. Time will tell whether I pass the test and my friends and family make it beyond the 22nd Century. Thank you."

176199668,Psychotic illness isn’t fun. Most people lead their lives without serious breaks with reality. Often the average person doesn’t deal with what we deal with. It’s just one of those things but we aren’t the only ones so consider that… There’s plenty of other people marginalized by our current society so we are 1%. That is special enough for most.
174393601,That’s a horrible question to ask. Schizophrenia isn’t going to kill you but cancer might. It’s a strong possibility that a lot of us will end up with both.

Thanks everybody! I appreciate all the well-wishes. My birthday was kind of anti-climatic. It was just dinner and dessert at my middle sisters house with me and my oldest sister and plenty of conversation. Also with my 30 year old nephew occasionally coming out of his room to talk. We didn’t have a cake but my oldest sister had gone to this fancy bakery shop and picked out three of the best cupcakes I have ever tasted piled high with mint, caramel and chocolate frosting. We split each one three ways. My step-mother had given me a check for $50.00. I don’t owe a dime to anybody so that $50.00 is mine to waste any way I want to. Maybe, I’ll buy some chocolate prolixen or vanilla risperidone (those are real things, right?). Anyways, thanks again, it made me feel good to see all your birthday wishes. Good luck to a

174393599,"Dear ilovethaifood, First, let me apologize for the long delay in response and thank you for your response to my initial email. Your experiences with haldol are important for me. The emergency department administers a lot of haldol. . .for psychosis, but also for intractable nausea and agitation. There are good clinical guidelines now that discourage what may be considered the liberal use of this medication in the _NAME_ setting. For one, there is good evidence that haldol can lead to emergency dystonic reactions in 3-10% of patients who receive it IM. Such reactions are often delayed and the effect of cumulative doses; so, for example, if someone in the _NAME_ gets 2-3 doses and then gets transferred to an inpatient psych setting, the _NAME_ team would not see this reaction. Much more importantly, the risk of exposing a person to such a side effect seems potentially traumatic. . .on top of a long _NAME_ stay and then facing inpatient stay to have this reaction could be a big recovery set back. So, 
backing up a bit, do you have a family history of schizophrenia? And has counseling ever been a component of your care? You also mentioned that abilify is the right med for you. What makes it “right” or more right than other meds? I appreciate your sensitive and pragmatic view on psychopharmacology and effectiveness. Thank you again for sharing your experiences. Have a great day, _NAME_"
174393600,"Since the most common subtype of schizophrenia is paranoid, who has no flat affect, no disorganized behavior; his madness is not obvious and he can work and have a family, as many studies show, why are we unemployed and unable to work?"

174393617,The vids look like a bad case of dystonia is happening you should talk to you doctor about the meds your taking sometimes antipsychotics they can do that to you typically the fist gen.

176199740,How are you sure it is the meds and not our minds playing tricks on us? I think for me that I feel safer without having to explain my word salad as some might say. It is hella embarrassing for me to stand there and say “$50-$1” Instead of “$1-$50”. I get odd looks sometimes. That is why I love working with children they look at you with respect if you earned their respect. But they never judge without cause. I don’t mean any offence when saying sometimes our moods are just from chemical imbalance not the meds. Though sometimes they do put us to sleep in higher doses. I hope for you sake and mine that we walk proudly with our oddness and get out and enjoy the sun.
174393608,"The special thing in Abilify, Rexulti and Vraylar is that they don’t fully block dopamine, they raise dopamine when its low and they lower dopamine when its high. I believe that’s why they cause less negative symptoms than all other antipsychotics."

176199773,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, from 2010-2012 I had a designated Community Psychiatric Nurse who visited me at home, initially twice a week then once a week then as I improved it went to once every two weeks and finally once a month before stopping altogether when I was discharged from the CMHT. The visits were usually 1 hour long from what I recall, though I think I occasionally had 2 hours if I requested it in advance. Thank you for sharing your experience!"
176199774,"it’s my circumstances most of all. im tired of sitting here all day. I will occasionally go into town to buy something, and I have appointments with my nurse and every 3 months with my pdoc. but that’s pretty much it. i don’t think an AD is what i need. i need a different life. sleeping in helps. less hours in the day so i have less downtime, slept in today until 10am. it’s like i need a little mini vacation every 3 months, and i need to go out to a restaurant 2 or 3 times a week or have a drink once a week not to get depressed. when i don’t do those things. it’s just life here where i no longer enjoy the music as much, or tv or movies. even being online gets old to me. i don’t know what im going to do about it. tried to talk mom and dad into letting me move back in with them so i wouldn’t be lonely. but they want me to stay in my own place."
176199775,So you deserve disability.
176199776,I’ve made an appointment with my doctor but he’s all booked up until next week. I am going to ask him for a prescription. Worth a shot. I’ve tried trazodone and gabapentin and they didn’t do anything.

176199783,Antipsychotics keep most of us out of hospital/institutions and in society. You can’t argue with that and if you have a look at psychiatry in the early days before thorazine we were treated horribly. I’m not saying it is a great system now because we need better meds and treatment but it’s a lot better than it was pre 1950’s. Avoid the antipsychiatry rhetoric peeps. It’s not factual and it’s not appropriate.

176199787,"If you have (severe) psychosis, there is already something wrong with your brain (unless it is only in the mind). If you have frequent psychosis, there is something even more wrong with your brain. It’s not the psychosis that fries the brain, it is the frying of the brain that produces psychosis. What your psychiatrist and nurse are saying, seems just like something designed to scare people into the arms of psychiatry and take neuroleptics chronically whether needed and/or at higher doses than necessary."
176199788,I’m not faking anything either. But I don’t believe everything happening to me is a delusion or hallucination.
176199789,Sorry you had a rough day earlier. Glad you are taking the time you need to get back to 100%! Take care.
176199790,I’ve had a lot of problems with things like that. No I wouldn’t.
176199791,I was on Fanapt (8 mg twice a day) and Seroquel (250 mg at night). I had to stop the Seroquel cause it raised my blood glucose levels.
176199792,"My pdoc told me when I had thoughts of murdering my mother that it was an intrusive thought which led me to believe that I was dangerous and I started to focus on it. I found that reassuring and I realised It was the illness making me believe I was dangerous, I wasn’t actually dangerous because I had told somebody.

176199819,"Once there was a church group of kids I used to know. Then one day we no longer went there. Once the children of Dad’s friends were our friends. One of them was a girl which I started out fighting but she beat me up a number of times. Then we became friends for a short time. At one point we were _NAME_ and _NAME_ walking together through the park annoying people. If we kept it up we would have been jailbirds for sure. In another World I am walking with her and she describes farmers driving her off when the crops were disturbed. And she counts the petals off a flower and tries to decide if she loves me or loves me not. And other moments include catching fireflies at night while eating dinner with the combined families. But we don’t have time to grow up or fall in love, or maybe just be friends. Because one of those nights me and my brothers left and never came back again. And we learned that our Dad would become less of a part of our lives because our parents are getting a divorce. And as far as 
I know we never met again because their parents weren’t Mom’s friends. By then we are in a new neighborhood and the nightmares begin. My head is hurting constantly. What’s wrong? It’s called a headache kid. Take an aspirin and learn to say goodbye to the past 8 years early. It’s gonna be a wild ride."

As a person with a physical disability, I can relate to being in a wheelchair- it’s heartbreaking at first, but when you start living your life happily, you end up seeing the good things in life. I joined a Korean schizophrenic group today and I ended up getting a lot of encouragements to not hate myself. They told me that I could get back into a normal state if I keep taking my medications and reaching out for therapy. I’m going to try to recover and get myself stable before I decline again."

176199825,"It depends on the portrayal, for me. My favorite schizophrenic character is River _USER_ID_ from Firefly. Her schizophrenia causes her to get into loads of trouble, but over time she starts to learn how to work with it, and becomes a helpful member of the team. She never would have gotten to that point without the love and support from everyone around her. I think that is an important message. That, no matter how sick you are, with the right resources you can accomplish great things. That needing people is a good thing. That it is important to believe in people when they are too sick to function, because they can only get better if they believe they can get better. That there is no upward limit on recovery. That we are all secretly government-trained assassins who can kill 50 people bare handed. Okay not that last one."

176199847,"Sensory processing is the way your brain interprets the outside world. Data from your ears/eyes/nerves get translated in the brain into sounds/sights/feelings. In a typical brain, this happens in a very expected way. garbage disposal turns on, your ears hear the sound, the data enters the brain, travels a specific path, and then you recognize the sound and move on. Sensory processing disorders is where sensory information, such as sounds, get interpreted incorrectly in your brain. Certain sounds can seem louder, or the data can jump to the wrong path and make you feel physical pain, or fear. If you have this issue, you might also find that the tags in clothes hurt, or certain foods feel too weird to eat, regardless of how they taste. You might also be more prone to randomly shouting or hitting yourself, because creating your own sensory output blocks the incoming signals for a bit. Does any of this sound like you?"

176199866,"So for awhile after getting sick I was an open book about hearing voices and experiencing delusions. I haven’t really experienced a delusion in two years, and the voices have become always positive and complimentary and can therefore be tuned out. It’s about as disabling as having a gnat fly around your ear a couple hours of every day. I’m thinking about getting back into work possibly once the pandemic is over. More importantly though, I think I’m going to never mention my disorder to any new people going forward. If it’s recovered to the point where I no longer am actively bothered by it, what’s the point in telling people? In the movie Joker he writes down that the worst thing about having a mental illness is that people expect you to act as if you don’t have a mental illness. I think I’m at the point where I can convincingly act like I don’t have a mental illness. So I’m thinking I basically go undercover as a healthy person. It will be hard to explain the large 5 year gap i

174393631,"NEW YORK, June 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting to be held on July 31, 2019 to discuss the New Drug Application (NDA) for lumateperone with the proposed indication of treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Lumateperone is a novel investigational drug with an NDA currently under review by FDA as a treatment of schizophrenia in adults. FDA’s expected Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is September 27, 2019. “There remains a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of schizophrenia,” said Dr. _NAME_, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. “We welcome the opportunity to present our data at the Advisory Committee meeting as we continue working to bring lumateperone to patients liv
ing with this debilitating disease.” About Lumateperone for the Treatment of Schizophrenia Lumateperone, our lead product candidate, is a molecule that provides selective and simultaneous modulation of serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate - three neurotransmitter pathways implicated in severe mental illness. Lumateperone is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, a dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator (DPPM) acting as a presynaptic partial agonist and postsynaptic antagonist at dopamine D2 receptors, a dopamine D1 receptor-dependent indirect modulator of glutamate (both NDMA and AMPA), and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This compound is being investigated in patients suffering from a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Company press release regarding FDA meeting"

176199915,"Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask some questions about my meds. I’m currently dealing with severe lack of energy - I mean, I feel extremely tired and sleepy all the time. I think it’s due to my meds (lithium, haloperidol, quetiapine) making me this way. I take 600 MG lithium, 10 MG haloperidol and 50 MG quetiapine in the morning. Then, I take 600 MG lithium, another 300 MG lithium, 10 MG haloperidol and 50 MG quetiapine at night. I think if I only take the night dose and don’t take my morning medicine, I have more energy and feel more alert (not manic or anything like that). I’ve actually tested this and I do feel more alert/awake when I don’t take my morning meds. A relative suggested it’s because I don’t do enough, which is another possibility, but I don’t fully believe it. So what should I do? Do you think the dose the doctor has me on is WAY too much and that’s why I’m getting severely tired? Do you think I should only take my night meds and skip the morning dose to keep from 
feeling so tired? And also, how long does the medicine stay in my body (whether I take the morning and night doses or just the night dose?) Should I talk to my doctor about this?"

I was not. Even at my sickest, when I could not hold a job,I was declared fit to work. What happened was that I became homeless and nearly died. Because I was deemed too lazy to work, rather than too sick. Better hope it never happens to you."

174393651,"Well they let me out of the psych ward yesterday and i will discharged today over the phone. It was an interesting experience for sure. I was in a single room until the last night i was there, they moved me with a roommate. I think i wrecked up my roommates sleep schedule from my snoring and sleep talking lol. I will say that the people i met reminded me that there is people out there not involved in my stalking. The first night i was put in an emergency psych room, it was just a bed in a white room. There was one other psych room beside mine, the person staying in that room died over night from a cardiac arrest. She was crying and needed a police officer from what i could tell. Being in a room like that reminded me of a soft prison anyways. I hope i never return to the psych ward. Ill be very careful of what i say to my psychiatrist now. During the first few days of being in the psych ward i heard some of the stories from the other patients about their lives in the psych ward. I heard a guy a coup
le doors down banging his head real hard against the door glass and he even bit the security guard watching him. You know tho, i wasent scared or anything, mostly just intrigued about what goes on in psych wards around the world. I did not get to meet another person with schizophrenia, sadly. Alot of days i wish i could be friends with another schizo in my own city, someone who understands the stuff us schizos go through. Maybe ill go to the mental health club and meet the others when im feeling up for it. For now ill stick to chatting with them online. _PERSON_ always found it kinda hard to relate with people irl since i tend to talk about overly technical or _NAME_ physical things. Small talk bores me so much and hearing life stories gets boring after a certain point. I like discussing things like quantum entanglement, ghosts, genes, psychics and making up creative stories. Talking about the weather or any other mundane thing seems like a formality. The nurses noticed i would isolate myself and kept forcing 
me to talk with them or the other patients. I played alot of games of crazy 8s. But im out of there and can go back to my computer lab to continue researching the stuff i find interesting. Being coped up for 3 days with no phone or smokes reminded me of the days i used to go camping and have to rough it. Im thankful i got a new experience."

176199944,My pharmacy warns me to not take ibuprofen or naproxen while on APs. They are not good together as they can cause APs to have a spike in your blood increasing bad effects especially on the kidneys and liver. I will occasionally take one if nothing else works but I try to steer clear when I can.
176199945,"I told my psychiatrist 3 mg wasn’t working and she said it should have been working by now but it could take up to 2 weeks. She went ahead and upped the dose to 4.5 and said we can scale back if it starts working. Might go back to Risperdal and just take a lot of caffeine pills if it doesn’t end up working. And while she found it odd that a stimulant would help with paranoia when for most people with those issues it makes it worse, she agreed to put me back on Vyvanse and see what happens. She’s the first psychiatrist who has ever actually listened to what I know about my own reactions to medications. I found a good one, finally."

176199947,I’m always thinking I blasphemed the Holy Spirit and therefore cant be saved. I don’t talk about it often bc I know it’s a delusion. I don’t even talk about it with my pdoc. I’m tired though of dealing with it. I’m so tired of life right now. My dad yells at me all the time over stupid stuff too.
176199948,"I was also addicted to alcohol before my diagnosis, I would drink with my friends at bars until I vomit on my friends and my brothers came to rescue me. They were very mad at me. I even passed out from drinking too much with my brothers at home. I vomitted in my bed. Because I drank too much, it made me psychotic, depressed, hallucinate and delusional. Strange thing is that it didn’t make me paranoid like weed. I would say weed is worse for SZ than alcohol but I stopped them both last year and never looked back."

176199954,When food takes place of the normal way you process emotions. So that you are reaching for food when you are anxious or upset or bored or any other emotion. I don’t know how to curb that kind of hunger. When your hunger is psychological it’s hard to combat. I’m deep down sad and I eat that. I’m deep down afraid and I eat that. I don’t know if I’ll be able to lose weight. I’m so upset right now. I have so much weight to lose and it seems unsurmountable.

176199998,I’m a big fan of therapy. I think it’s a great tool. I think you would be wise to go to couple’s counselling. It is an hour of the week that you set aside to make communication a priority. It’s like saying we value each other and this relationship so much that we’re going to nurture it. And I like that. I hope he wants to go too.
176199999,You need to speak to your psychiatrist. Why? You’re on a mood stabiliser but it doesn’t seem to be doing it’s job. You get these very depressive lows. I’m not a doctor so I don’t know what needs to be added/tweaked. But these depressive swings sound dangerous. Don’t fall for them though. Fight the disease.

176200043,Yes I am 36 going on 37. So basically same age as you. I had lived on my own between 19 and 30yo when sz striked. I always had trouble coping with stress but I thought I’d manage. Now I am being very careful with my stress levels and taking it easy. I save money like crazy in case one day I can no longer hold down a job.

176200082,Yawning when you’re not tired can be a sign of anxiety.
176200083,hi _AT_MENTION_ I’m worried about your well being and mental health. You seem to be expressing a lot of psychotic symptoms on the forum. That must mean a lot of suffering for you and you are perhaps quite frightened. The TV lady is of no significance. Ignore that. You sound quite unwell. Can you see your psychiatrist soon? It seems like you need to review your medication and perhaps increase your anti-psychotic dose. It’s important that you make it a priority to see your prescribing doctor. When is your next appointment mate?
176200084,That’s good _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ . Maybe you’re just experiencing extrapyrimidal symptoms which will stop upon stopping the medicine rather than TD which is permanent
176200085,"There is another herbal supplement called valerian root which is an excellent relaxant just like holy basil but in a stronger way. Its promoted as a sleeping aid for general population but for people who have mental problems like OCD, anxiety, depression etc it act like a nootropic improving mental functioning. It acts like benzodiazepines improving GABA function in brain without the sideffects linked with benzo. Its also useful in reducing seizures as its one of the first treatment for seizure due to its modulating effect on GABA. Valerian is especially useful if you suffer from OCD, have mild symptoms of catatonia, impulsivity, anxiety etc."

Existence is very strange, how vast the universe is and just the amount of people in the world. 7.5 billion from a google search. Though much of what i studied was the older philosphers. I know _NAME_ has some interesting videos on youtube about how existence is weird or being “human”. Combined with knowing that language is pretty arbitrary, i kinda see the point of just giving up or going with the flow of life. So naturally i went towards stoicism, you can’t control much."

As far as feeling less guilty about it, myself for example I used to work 60 hours a week if not more. Now I don’t work at all. Some of that is due to schizophrenia, but there are several other mitigating factors as well. It sucks, but you have to do what’s necessary for you.

176200157,I’m currently looking into potato starch as an affordable source of resistant starch to greatly benefit gut flora. Certain brands may be high in solanine though so discretion is needed. Also some people are allergic to potatoes so this isn’t for everyone. I read that one person was able to heal his leaky gut-induced rheumatoid arthritis with 2/3rds of a cup of potato starch in water a day. He was able to stop taking his anti-rheumatic medication for a period of 8 months up until he posted. I imagine he’s still doing alright.
176200158,"Summer 1982: Was 15 months into a psych stay. My father in Atlanta working as British consul general. He’d sold the family home. My mother living with a school teacher who resented my siblings and I,especially me. The future options were transfer to a long stay ward or life in a group home. I was not doing well. A month later I met my wife. The first person who’d really believed in me after I become ill. 6 months later we left hospital together. I won’t pretend it was easy. I lacked independent living skills, and my wife had the psychological stress/ trauma of having her 2 youngest in care. I won’t go into details beyond saying sibling dishonesty and vindictiveness was a major part of her children ending up in care. It was ironic that after years arguing my wife was an unfit mother the youngest one only came back after an abortion where the foster father was undoubtedly the one who’d got her pregnant. He’d also molested other foster daughters. Social services didn’t want to deal with 
the emotional and psychological fallout from it, so my wife and I miraculously became suitable people after years of being treated as unsuitable. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses. If i compare myself to those of similar age and intellect without ASD and SMI I don’t do well. However it’s 38 years and a month since I was last in psych hospital. I was with my wife for 22 years and married for nearly 19 years. I have great stepfamily near me, who love me as I love them. Life could be a lot worse. If euthanasia for mental illness had been available in the summer of 1982 I might easily have chosen that option. I’m glad it wasn’t."

You need to do it right now. Get off the site and report it now."
176200292,Thanks _AT_MENTION_! I’m sorry about the no creeps comment because everyone is so warm and welcoming! I have been lied to before online but that’s not a nice way to start a convo. I like it here already because of everyone’s warm welcome & I will join in <3 ox
176200293,Hey thanks! All is going well. Im actually getting to the bottom of the fatigue and hypersomnia issues. _PERSON_ says I likely have a sleep disorder so I’m getting a sleep study done. It’s likely I have the non 24 hour sleep wake disorder. It makes sense cuz some days my mornings feel like night and my nights feel like mornings Hope you are well ninja Cheers

176200306,Maybe you could go see a therapist a little more often. Idk if that would help with some of your fears. But keep looking for the right job definitely. I applied for another job today too since the other one never called. In fact I was just about to go looking for more to apply for. We just got to keep looking till we find the right fit. Don’t give up hope.
176200307,My nephew and niece both have Attention Deficit Disorder.
176200308,For the record my dyskinesia has gone away. There was a turning point where it became where it could be treated as more of a habit if it were to occur and was quickly replaced with restlessness or akathisia a bit. Thats where im at now with liking to walk around when I’m standing when outside waiting and rocking back and forth a bit or tapping my leg when sitting. It is not unpleasant though it is welcome it is a good sign. Extreme protracted withdrawals from psychiatric drugs are quite normal and commonplace and that is a factual thing. Although being young and making not a single mistake over the period of years my brain has recovered in that sense
176200309,So great to have those kind of supportive people in your life!

176200318,Thanks. I think the worst about life a lot but then almost every day no matter what I’m going through. I’ll have a good moments where I think: life is just life. Good and bad is going to happen. I just have to accept that life is good a lot of the time. Have a nice night.

176200327,"_AT_MENTION_ when I was younger I had the strong feeling that I was separated by everyone else. But as I’ve grown older I don’t feel it as much. I think the meds help me feel that I fit in a little better. I don’t have this whole other world happening inside my head when I’m trying to be with other people so that helps. And I’m not as self conscience as I used to be and that helps too because I don’t feel so beneath other people. I just don’t feel so different like I used to. My husband really helped me with that I think. And believe it or not this site helps me a lot because there are so many other people with my same experiences and I don’t feel so alone with it all, there’s a reason why my head is the way it is and I feel accepted on some level."

176200344,Thinking about something for a long period of time is very psychotic but since its just meds I would say its normal. see I was like that when I was a starter in sz but then I went and got my meds reduced.

176200361,Sorry you’re going through this _AT_MENTION_.
176200362,Dysfunctional families are the norm and not an exception sadly. Problem is: most people are not going to see it or want to admit to it if they could see it because it is excruciatingly painful to admit and see. What most people do is find a way to ‘cope’ so as to avoid that pain. I feel horrified right now and dealing with excruciating pain just noticing this in my family as well. ‘Coping’ is just… not the way to go about this problem at all. I’ve been doing that for YEARS and all it does it make you feel horrible when you finally start to wake up to what was buried.

176200365,"These were the voices before they actually became full blown real consciousness inside me. In a way they were even more uncomfortable because I was so anxious about them I could hardly work, I was just so worried about going outside to the shops or anywhere, glad that’s over now. I really really really love silence now. The voices when they became voices as in people, had three stages one; they would only come when I was in view of a camera. And I wasn’t able to talk to them I would just listen as they observed me, wherever I thought it was, then they’d come all over the house at second, except my bedroom where I didn’t think there were cameras, third stage they’d confessed to being able to see out of my eyes and I wa having long conversations with them, were then omnipresent as they saw what I saw.

174393738,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Cochrane database of systematic reviews , Dec 2019 12 People with schizophrenia have a range of different symptoms, including positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (such as social withdrawal and lack of affect), and cognitive impairment. The standard medication for people with schizophrenia is antipsychotics. However, these medications may not be effective for all symptoms of schizophrenia, as cognitive and negative symptoms are usually hard to treat. Additional therapies or medications are available for the management of these symptoms. Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent most frequently used in narcolepsy or shift work sleep disorder, is one intervention that is theorised to have an effect of these symptoms.The primary objective of this review was to assess the effects of modafinil for people with schizophren
ia or related disorders.On 27 April 2015, 24 May 2017, and 31 October 2019, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials, which is based on regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register.We selected all randomised controlled trials comparing modafinil with placebo or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.We independently extracted data from the included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. We used a random-effects model for the _NAME_-analysis. We used GRADE to complete a 'Summary of findings' table and assessed risk of bias for the included studies.Eleven studies including a total of 422 participants contributed to data ana
lyses. Most studies had a small population size (average 38 people per study) and were of short duration. We also detected a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting in just under 50% of the trials. We therefore rated the overall methodological quality of the included studies as low. We considered seven main outcomes of interest: clinically important change in overall mental state, clinically important change in cognitive functioning, incidence of a clinically important adverse effect/event, clinically important change in global state, leaving the study early for any reason, clinically important change in quality of life, and hospital admission. All studies assessed the effects of adding modafinil to participants' usual antipsychotic treatment compared to adding placebo to usual antipsychotic treatment. Six studies found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on overall mental state of people with schizophrenia, specifically the risk of worsening psychosis (RR 0
.91, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.98; participants = 209; studies = 6, low-quality evidence). Regarding the effect of modafinil on cognitive function, the trials did not report clinically important change data, but one study reported endpoint scores on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB): in this study we found no clear difference in scores between modafinil and placebo treatment groups (MD -3.10, 95% CI -10.9 to 4.7; participants = 48; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Only one study (N = 35) reported adverse effect/event data. In this study one serious adverse event occurred in each group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). One study measured change in global state using the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale. This study found that adding modafinil to antipsychotic treatment may have little or no effect on global state (RR 6.36, 95% CI 0.94 to 43.07, participants = 21; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Nine studies found that m
odafinil has no effect on numbers of participants leaving the study early (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.52 participants = 357; studies = 9, moderate-quality evidence). None of the trials reported clinically important change in quality of life, but one study did report quality of life using endpoint scores on the Quality of Life Inventory, finding no clear difference between treatment groups (MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.78; participants = 20; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence). Finally, one study reported data for number of participants needing hospitalisation: one participant in each group was hospitalised (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.06 to 12.42; participants = 35; studies = 1, very low-quality evidence).Due to methodological issues, low sample size, and short duration of the clinical trials as well as high risk of bias for outcome reporting, most of the evidence available for this review is of very low or low quality. For results where quality is low or very low, we are uncertain or very uncertain if the effect esti
mates are true effects, limiting our conclusions. Specifically, we found that modafinil is no better or worse than placebo at preventing worsening of psychosis; however, we are uncertain about this result. We have more confidence that participants receiving modafinil are no more likely to leave a trial early than participants receiving placebo. However, we are very uncertain about the remaining equivocal results between modafinil and placebo for outcomes such as improvement in global state or cognitive function, incidence of adverse events, and changes in quality of life. More high-quality data are needed before firm conclusions regarding the effects of modafinil for people with schizophrenia or related disorders can be made."

My boyfriend who is very intelligent says I’m not crazy, that he knew crazy people that have died crazy and I’m not it. I believe him. But I still can’t get over how depressing it is that they’ll take me away and turn me into a man, the dictator. And my boyfriend who is now cruel will find it funny after he abandons me. (Maybe he isn’t cruel, but he won’t be maybe able to stop it from happening). It’s so messed up but I get to be happy for 10 years until this happens. And then I go to hell in the end. I feel like some predator posting here because I feel like responses help me feel better. But I feel like I’m not in the appropriate forums because I don’t really have this problem.

I do understand the thought though as i felt like i could kill myself a lot in my life too but these days i’m doing better so just keep in mind that things can get better really.
176200409,I agree with your guess. Probably you should give up Seroquel as it has caused serious side effects to you.
176200410,So I’m down to 183lbs. I like how I look I just want to reach a goal of a healthy bmi. Only a couple more pounds to go and I am in the clear.
174393757,"Just curious, what supplement are you on and do they help with your positive symptoms? Also, what dosage of medication are you on"
176200411,It takes will power for sure but there’s a lot of diets out there and if you find the right one for you it will make things tolerable. What I mean is that someone might recommend a certain diet that worked wonders for them but may not be right for you. It may not allow enough calories or carbs for you to follow it for any length of time. But if you do some research and maybe work with PCP or a nutritionist you might find one that is not too restrictive and doesn’t leave you hungry all day and is realistic and not some fad diet where you eat cabbage soup all day for three weeks and you’ll shed 10 lbs. but gain it all back four days after you stop it.
174393754,What got worse? Positive or negative symptoms? If positive ask your psychiatrist about it.
174393758,I’ve only ever suffered and brought destruction into our lives. I see no positive.

176200468,It’s a law suit. I can’t confirm or deny. Not sure what your asking but we’re just average schizophrenics and our personal battles are just that. From what your saying I think your in that realm regardless. Side effects are curious things but so are delusions. Proving that in a court of law is a pretty big stretch and with most things there’s probably some previous cases. Good luck to you but it’s not kosher to ask about this in my opinion. We are seeking support for psychiatric problems. Not trying to offer legal advice for litigation. My two cents!

You should call up a work-benefits-counselor to guide you through this process. Not sure their exact title. Although mine mislead me with information applicable to ssi, not ssdi.

174393762,"I’m on Saphris now, as well as Lithium, but my prolactin is still elevated from the risperdal I was taking months ago. The only medications to really lower the prolactin are meds like cabergoline and bromocriptine which they will not prescribe to me, you or anyone else with history of psychosis as it will likely cause another psychotic episode to occur as it raises dopamine. The only thing you can really do at this point is be patient, and get on a prolactin sparing AP. You may have luck with Abilify, as this lowers prolactin over time, although in rare cases like me, it did not do this. Abilify is still your best bet for lowering prolactin over time. You can also try Vraylar or Rexulti if that is available in your area."

The two main issues I’ve had in terms of bad outcomes from meds were the explosive weight gain from Zyprexa and the agranulocytosis from the Clozaril. My ongoing strategy is to use coping strategies, therapy, and a handful of proven supplements to function on a minimal dose of head meds. I defintely can’t go off them, but I don’t have to eat them out of a PEZ dispenser, either."

176200475,"Been on up to klonopin .5 prn daily for quite some time now. Been on klonopin for 10 1/2 years now and never built a tolerance or anything. Klonopin helps keep me stable. I started off on different doses but settled for .25 or .5 per day depending on how I feel. It works really well. It annoys me when people try to tell me klonopin is gonna ruin my life, etc… then they ask how long I’ve been on it I say 10 1/2 years and they’re befuddled considering I haven’t gone up but rather down in dose. Everybody is obviously different but if it works and is needed it should be considered. I’m just lucky it did work so well. I was probably the last candidate for klonopin when they initially gave it to me. But it worked out alright. Funny how it all works Another thing. People asked me “is your memory bad”. I’m like nah I remember too much… they say oh it’s probably cuz you’re on a low dose. I say probably true…"

Someone using a drone to light an explosive firework in my yard Silent calls and silent voicemail Watching me from windows Having the same car as me Following where I drive and taking a picture with flash Driving by my house when I leave _PERSON_ and taunting at my window Calling my number just to take a bong rip and laugh Some of those can be true experiences that I’m misinterpreting. Others I’m not sure. The part about someone from my past messing with me is what’s hard to shake because I know I can hold a grudge. But I wouldn’t troll someone like I feel is happening to me.
176200482,"I don’t know for certain, but I bet that changes somewhat from ap to ap. Also, these drugs affect people differently.

Personally, all the typical ap’s reduce me to the point that I barely qualify as a life form. I might could qualify as a fungus when I am on them. For other people that kind of drug is no problem."

Then I find out it’s as effective as Risperdal. Yeah I may give it another try. Going to bring it up with my doctor."

176200515,"yeah _AT_MENTION_ mine just changes topic too. I relate to all you write. I don’t really have any friends to talk to for a real conversation, kinda why I joined this forum. I work in customer service so get to have a lot of real conversations with customers & the imaginary convo’s stop then but the emotion doesn’t change, I’m still stuck with intense anguish/rage. For me emotion comes before thought, not the other way around. My psychologist said I had the emotional age of a pre-verbal child & was incapable of change/neuroplasticity. But Zyprexa helped dampen the emotion so I may go back on that next Tues. That’s cool you have a science background, you sound super smart. I love plant ecology, I do volunteer work at my local bush-land reserve to bolster endangered species & biodiversity. I began a bachelor in Conservation Biology but couldn’t concentrate, plus I don’t really have a scientific mind! Does science play a happy part in your life these days? I’m sorry dr’s and nurses ha

Mental health issues isn’t worse than many other debilitating diseases. Almost everyfamily has someone who requires extra care. I think my parents are glad that I am in their lives even though I am not very resourceful, I am able to do things for them if nothing more than keep them company and help with tech stuff.

Thus, recovery may be facilitated by increasing self-compassion, the ability to respond with a nonjudgmental attitude of kindness toward oneself as a result of connecting with one's own inadequacies and suffering. We conducted a stepwise regression in individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (n = 92) to determine the unique contributions of cognitive variables in predicting self-compassion, such as metacognition (the ability to form complex and integrated ideas about oneself and others), mindfulness, and cognitive insight. Results indicated that increased metacognitiv
e awareness of others and mindfulness uniquely predicted greater self-compassion (i.e., self-kindness), whereas increased cognitive insight predicted greater lack of self-compassion (i.e., self-judgment). These findings suggest the potential for mindfulness and metacognitive interventions to increase positive self-compassion and promote recovery in psychosis."

174393817,"I realize that. But you didn’t just wake up one day and decide, “I’m gonna rewire my brain so I don’t have schizophrenia”. I’m not saying you can’t recover from sz, but you don’t just “rewire” your brain. That’s delusional talk."
176200659,"_AT_MENTION_ we are growing summer squash, zucchini, _USER_ID_ and butternut squashes. Loaded with sweet green peppers and beefsteak tomatoes. A few watermelon are started and radishes getting ready to pop soon. Blackberries on the way too. Woodchuck a te all the broccoli and pickling cukes. I did some easy watercoloring for junk/art journaling. Had some lava beads and plan to make aroma-bracelets with bluish _NAME_ and tigers eye. Yesterday: Attended webinar to onboard a subscription app. Did some random painting with watercolor. I have a new niece and my best friend have birth to a daughter as well a few hours ago."

176200662,"It is nice that he is being kind to you now. But please stay critical. F.e. read about codependent versus healthy relationships, let him wait still with sex. I know that when you are hurt and lonely, sex and attention can feel so good, that it is hard to break away from. You arent a bad or weak person for that, but please take care of yourself. And you arent the only one struggling with this! I right now feel sexual attraction towards someone who would be bad for me if I would act on it. We dance together, so i cant stay away and there is lots of physical contact. I need all my discipline to not try and seduce him. Im lonely and long for someone to hold. So i know it is hard!"
174393836,"I just find it really stressful too stressful to muster up the motivation. Maybe it’s an energy thing too. In particular I used to do jogging. Now when I try it’s not even that I run out of breath, it’s just that my legs just don’t listen to my brain so powerful these meds."
176200663,"The psychological element is there with a particular place, then (sometimes)?"
174393826,"What makes you think you are that important for ‘men to follow you’? I don’t mean to be rude, I just am trying to get you to realize such things. My mom kept telling me that when I told her my thoughts and stories of Berkeley. I remember some things: I remember thinking people were really after me; I remember telling my mom and sister I could not tell what was real; and I remember missing for at least 3 days. I remember posting something important on facebook and that’s all. My mom doesn’t remember what I posted – but she should have!. I remember being taken out of my cooperative room at Berkeley by men. I have no clue why or what happened. I read other horror stories of people being taken to Mars and ????, but I doubt that. Sometimes, I think I was abducted by grey aliens. I have no ??????? clue. Am I on a different Earth? Was time travel involved? According to my story, I smoked pot and developed psychosis. I tried to get help but couldn’t. I then dropped out a month or so later. I 
think my dad had bitched and complained about picking me up but did anyways cause he always has to work… Were aliens involved or the military? I don’t know. But I saw some black, rectangular craft in 2016 that told me or asked me what I remember happened to me at Berkeley…did something else happen there? I might have seen such similar craft at Berkeley, but cannot verify it. I sometimes think my family are clones, dating back to possibly the 1970s. I don’t know. I sometimes doubt I’m even human. That I’m either an extraterrestrial myself or an android. An android with schizophrenia you say? How could that be possible? I don’t know. I was thinking _PERSON_ from BSG. I have memories of going and living on Mars…which caused anxiety, paranoia, and fear on top of my mental breakdown. Initially I thought it was real, but then I started to reject it. There’s a program caused project Moonshadow which is a milab program, but I had trauma which those guys don’t have. I had a normal, loving childhood
. I don’t understand how I could be in all these different programs. For what end? For what purpose? I cannot honestly tell what is real or what happened there anymore. I keep time traveling back to berkeley most times and repeating my life over and over again with schizophrenia. I bet you it’s some higher entity thing going on… I think I was in: Monarch, Montauk, Milabs, Secret Space Program, and a Super Soldier (super soldier is a genetically or technologically enhanced human). I’ve also time traveled. I just keep waking up and living these other lives I guess. That’s why I think it’s a simulation. Do you have any thoughts like that? Did you do something wrong? Maybe talk to a therapist or a doctor or something because you have had this delusion the last time I was here. It must be troubling. I think mine was real though. It could be the mental illness, but I think it’s 100% real and will come out in the future. My main objective is recovery but I think I’m owed some money or at least an exp
lanation on what happened to me. My life is more important than money though. I just get frustrated when people sue for stupid ???? but then people like me get nothing. I have had pretty much the same delusions too. I often think my mind was blank slated or something and that’s why I cannot remember. I live my life day to day. I put my faith in God. All else follows."
176200664,"No, it should be okay. Prime rib sounds fancy. I’ve never had it. My ex used to get it all the time, he loved it."
176200665,Good for you _AT_MENTION_! Hang in there.
174393822,Why did you go off of it
176200666,"I have my windows open but the curtains closed. I heard like 3 guys outside talking at a rate of knots. Then suddenly mid sentence they disappear. No talking, no noise nothing"
176200667,"It breaks my heart that you are so hard on yourself. I’m like that too. We set impossible standards for ourselves that no one could ever reach. You’re a good person. If someone was talking about you the way you talk about yourself, I’d have words with them. You deserve to love yourself. You have a ton of value. I know it gets hard to see it, but you are such a wonderful, kind person. You’re going through a rough patch financially, but the amount of money you have doesn’t equal the amount of value you have. Please be kind to yourself. If you’re anything like me then that’s the hardest thing anyone could ask of you, but the more you try the better you get it at. Loving yourself is like anything else, it takes practice. Every time you have a negative thought about yourself, say two positive things about yourself immediately."
176200668,"Yep. When I was in North _USER_ID_’s state hospital (one of them), they kept black people locked up forever if they were psychotic enough. I went to one of the adult units and this old, frail lady came up to me and said she saw me on Jeopardy last night. Sad. There were 4 HUGE adult units. Packed with poor black people. I’m not being discriminatory. The hospital was built for the black community. Things are still backwards as hell there."
176200669,“You wont believe your eyes when you see this latest beauty trend!”
176200670,I find the CMHT can be a bit hit or miss. My local team isn’t great including the psychiatrist who at best is incompetent and worst neglectful. Best of luck _AT_MENTION_
176200671,"_AT_MENTION_ Eat again. Eat your friend’s food,too. This will assert dominance and impress them."
176200672,Yes you can take fish oil supplements along with your meds. No problem _AT_MENTION_
176200673,Sometimes. Like I saw a plate that started with 666 during one crappy day. Read too much into it.
176200674,I need to exercise more. I have the time and no excuse not to.
176200675,_AT_MENTION_ do you braid your own hair?
176200676,"Yeah, I remember _PERSON_ saying that one time, I think, “I’m just a country doctor.”"
176200677,I had a bad reaction. Gave me SI and visual hallucinations. But everyone reacts differently.
176200678,"Gotta get crack-a-lackin’. Got tons to do and I’m expecting the grandkids later. Once they’re here I won’t get much done. But I’m so sleepy and drained. The coffee clearly has something terribly wrong with it, it’s defective or something. I demand a refund. I need better coffee. Espresso perhaps? I realized last night that I didn’t take meds yesterday morning, lol so no wonder it was a sort of an off day for me. And now today I’m feeling uninspired, go figure. It doesn’t take much to throw this finely balanced system off. lol."

174393824,"Thanks for your worries! Yes, he knows, we keep close track of things. Dont worry."
176200683,You’re doing well so far. You’ve got a good attitude. I think you can beat this.
176200684,"Wowwwws, that sounds delicious _AT_MENTION_! Salmon is so good, and has those Omega-3’s and fatty acids that are so beneficial for our brains. Would probably skip the hummus, as I can’t control myself with just one serving of it"
176200685,"I think more from a ethical standpoint, on one way it is a duty to procreate, on the other hand we must consider the effects it has in a world like ours which is full of pollution due to overpopulation. Another important factor is to consider the population pyramid of your country, for example Japan and some European countries have a system that is going to collapse as there are many more elders than young people so the solutions are either mass immigration or policies to encourage procreation."
176200686,Good luck _AT_MENTION_.

176200693,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ I’m going to try my best
176200694,I have issues with accepting my illness. I thought that my IQ was also inaccurate. Mine is 110.

176200698,I have Monday off. I have to cut the grass. Pull the weeds in the flower beds and put up a fence. I would almost rather be at work but I am going to have a BBQ. Maybe swim a bit. Hope you enjoy your holiday.
174393828,I’m definently better off alone (except for close family) nobody could possibly understand my schizophrenia and how real it is to me
174393831,i think yes most likely

176200700,"I suspect that chocolate makes my hallucinations more vivid. To be fair, I did not have this suspicion before I started to visit this site. It is probably a combination of factors, but around 100-200g of milk chocolate probably does factor in."
176200701,That stuff is against doctor / patient confidentiality. Fireable if discovered.
176200702,I’m sorry your offended. That’s the last thing I wanted. I have ‘necromancy’ and have had wonderful convos at the dinner table with people in my extended family.
176200703,It is good. I watch it over and over.
176200704,Didn’t help at all. They already had all my medical information and insurance. He prescribed migraine medicine. I have had the migraine consistently for three weeks every single morning. The medicine isn’t supposed to prevent or actually treat what’s causing the migraine and you can’t take more than 6 doses so it’s not meant to be taken every day. It would be more for infrequent migraines it seems. It kind of made me mad because Imitrex is a Serotonin Agonist!! It would likely cause Serotonin Syndrome if I took it with the Strattera. It says it shouldn’t be used with an SSRI or SNRI. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatriptan https://www.drugs.com/dosage/imitrex.html I’m so frustrated. I don’t think I’ll ever be taken seriously. I need to demand an MRI.
174393833,It might be schizophrenia.
176200705,"Aricept is a drug that treats Alzheimer’s, and it is having an effect on my consciousness. It is taking away those manic flights of fancy I have, which I think I need to be able to write. I think I am going to stick with it a while. I will probably grow accustomed to it, but right now it is making me feel bad."
176200706,Walked my brothers dogs. Visited my sacred neigh and a woman who also agists there and she said she’s doesn have friends and I said neither do I as such and I said I can be her friend. We might only meet when we both see the horses but something is something. Sent my last Christmas card.
176200707,Negatives mostly but if stressed paranoia. It’s a slippery slope into wrong thinking and chasing shadows. That really bites.

176200710,"I think I’ve earned SOME parallels to _NAME_ Nash. Just hear me out… Because at least I’ve balanced this sentiment with a lot of negative quotes from the flick… and it’s a biopic, so he was a person. I just have a long history of power struggles, and a great (Female boss) once said “Don’t get creative” on that front. I have nothing but good things to say about her, for what it’s worth. But her advice came too late. So that’s me establshing ethos, an academic word, I was taught to mean credibility(In Rhetoric 101). But I’ll just spit it out. We do these “jousts” and all we’re actually trying to pound our chests about, is to see who: A.) “Can think on their feet more-so…” and B.) “To see who has a better crystal ball…” (People just love to be right! I just sort of think if we could loosen our grip(perceived value) on these two items, we’d either avoid conflicts more, or perhaps more exciting - maybe we’d even excel at them more? There’s always a bigger ba

176200711,"Can’t complain. No change in medication. Pdoc is really nice Sorry that was a short answer. I didn’t have my tea so I’m just waking up. She calmed my anxieties with medication. Ex: me falling over and getting dizzy is because meds change your body temp (you can over heat fast). I’m getting blood work done Monday for Depakote, and she said I was on a low dose. Usually it’s how much you weigh and add a 0. She doesn’t want my shot to change from monthly since she just prescribed the fluphenazine. She said shes still trying to tackle thoughts that aren’t real with my meds. Klonopin does give you memory loss but what I’m experiencing isn’t from the Klonopin it’s sz. If I can think of anything else. I’ll let you know. But she was a wealth of information and had an answer to all my questions!"
176200712,Yes I don’t think she can force meds on me. Thanks _AT_MENTION_

176200715,I had a vent for 10 minutes in the disability committee and I feel exhausted psychologically
176200716,You probably can’t continue to use samples forever. You need to talk to your psychiatrist about getting meds in the traditional way.
176200717,It was the first time I had a dream with pain in it

176200722,Don’t need to be sorry … but it is kinda triggering topic so I get you.
176200723,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to rub it in on the academic stuff. It’s just that that was the high point of my life, a high point I fell from. Yes, I am very blessed. I have a place to stay, family, food to eat, income for bills. I am very lucky. I’m sorry you weren’t so lucky. One thing I don’t understand is how luck is so unevenly distributed in life. I’ve had a lot of luck, if you want to call it that."
176200724,"Yes ! Hold on, I got a meme for this."
176200725,yep i worked when i was in psychosis a bunch of times. I dont even know how I pulled it off

176200727,Since age 32 I haven’t had a single psychosis that lasted more than 8 hours
176200728,"Depends on your metabolism i suppose. Took me about 6 months before the 300mg night dose didnt compleletly knock me out, but i was drinking on them as well at the time - so probably sooner. Its a great drug in my opinion - the anti-depressant effects are a bonus."
176200729,"My so called “mates” frequently confuse my kindness for weakness. Im the soft touch that will always get the round in at the bar - and never get one back. That and a certain crackhead thats started knocking my door again - asking for my wifi key. Ive officially got no mates, and those that do are usually after something. I dont actually care. Im looking after number 1."

How do you know what you deserve from 2 lifetimes ago or 3, etc? So there’s a chance we will be around the same people as this lifetime as another? It really is sad when a couple who has been married for 50 years die years apart. What keeps them going is seeing their husband/wife again. Are they on to something?"
176200733,Oh yeah I remember that it increases prostate cancer risk like they say in your link.
174393847,Start small. Little bit of exercise to get moving. Eat smarter. Try and read a little bit at first. I started reading _NAME_. I’d seen the movies and it was easier to understand. I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. I do well and live large but honestly I work pretty gawdamn hard to get a bit of function. I’ve been in similar states and I’ve just worked my ways out of it. Don’t bury yourself in a hole. Make some positive changes to improve. We all can do it! I’m still doing it every single day of my life!

176200745,I’m sure it’s a tried and true method dating back to antiquity. I rather not think about it. It causes pain just thinking of the abuse and sickness people come up with to have power over someone else. That type of abuse makes me sick. It reminds me of munchausen by proxy.
174393850,"Sorry, I am beginning to realize that people like me with schizophrenia are under the extremely vulnerable high risk category. I am still afraid to get the vaccine. But I am doing more searching online to see if others have had it and did not have side effects."

Why can’t I be normal?"
176200762,"In fact I’ll tell you a story when I had to confront a fellow nurse. I was doing rotations on an acute care ward. Mostly elderly patients. Other nurse I’d worked with a few times, always seemed nice enough, got along with her. One day about halfway through our shift she just starts to seem odd. Slurring her speech, stumbling, nodding off. She tripped down the hallway and couldn’t get herself up. We got her into a chair and her eyes are blow wide dilated. Cant even keep her head up. We called the ambulance and they hit her with an opioid reversal. After I wrote my report on the incident, and audits were done, turns out she had been stealing fentanyl patches and had overdosed right on the floor. Again she was a nice enough person, but she was unsafe to practice. It wasn’t fair to the patients."

176200771,Was on Sertraline 200mg for about 5 years. And i can honestly say it did bog all for me. They say i was depressed - I say i was raving bloody delusional! . No signs of depression were shown from me after being on Ap’s for a while. I reckon i was depressed cos i was just bonkers - and once that was treated i been fine more or less.

174393857,Finding one person to fall in love with and live with was a major purpose in my life for many years. I had an obsession as a part of my illness that lasted more than 20 years. (Actually she was not interested in me.) The interest in a lover has faded lately. At this stage I have a few personal problems that would not work with a close companion. I think I am a mature single man.
176200800,But I didn’t feel I could relate in all the ones I went to. Is it different for everyone ? Maybe a broader support group mix of different people would be better and more relatable.

174393854,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 6 months ago. I knew something wasn’t right with me but I believe the lack of insight caused me to not know or even have the words to describe what I was experiencing my whole life. I have never tried any medication this is the first time I’m seeing a psychiatrist and he highly recommends Latuda. I’m scared. I’ve seen so many videos and read so many posts about people going through nightmares trying different medicines and all of the side effects. I’m not suffering greatly from positive symptoms or rather I’m not tormented by voices. I have mostly delusions, odd thinking, voices but only under extreme stress or being alone. Actually it’s the negative symptoms and the anxiety that are the worst symptoms and delusions. Lack of will to shower, go places or feel motivation keeps me pretty isolated. Wondering if anyone has any advice about medicine about Latuda and yea I’m just really scared to try it. I’m scared i’ll be that one in 1 million 
person to get severe tremors or dyskinesia or something. But then again I’ve heard that some people only need a little bit of antipsychotic and it really opens up their world and helps. I have the meds sitting here every night I want to feel better but I’m scared."

176200827,Happened 4 years ago. I think it was a hallucination or a coincidence I gave meaning to when there was none. How to tell if hallucination? The spouse was driving the car and I pointed it out but this coincidence had no effect on him. I had been hearing voices for awhile at this point and believed they were real and asked the sky if I was forgiven. It seemed like it answered me with this event and then I was told through the spouse as if someone else’s was talking through him that it was galactic entanglement and that I had nothing to worry about. This is after I looked up the word redeemed which was on the guys jacket on the motorcycle with a picture of Jesus and I thought I was told don’t bank on it from some ad on the page I was looking at. Now years later I’m thinking this whole thing was just schizophrenia crap and the delusion/hallucination playing both ends. Anyway I’m still going to hell according to the voices.

176200837,"Antipsychotic for insomnia alone is a bad idea, at least in my case. Before I had sza, back when my diagnosis was bipolar and I wasn’t hallucinating, I was prescribed large doses of Seroquel for sleep. It just has too much of a side effect for such a small symptom. If you’re dealing with delusions and hallucinations however, it can be a good treatment. It’s just a little heavy handed to use a heavy duty antipsychotic as a sleep aid."

It gets an “obsession”… I write "" dimethylglycine "" , "" sarcosine "" , "" phosphatidylserine "" and I look for studies for carcinogenicity It’s a big problem… I would like to test but I saw studies on google which are contradictory… For dimethyglycine, a person ( _PERSON_ ) said the mutagenicity was caused by unconsommed nitrites. Another, 10 years before in 1980 ( _PERSON_ ) said the mutagenicity was caused by dimethylglycine. A work in "" Cancer and nutrition"" said it causes cancer… For sarcosine, I had an answer of a person of a website on sarcosine and schizophrenia who said The evidence for that isn’t very strong, and it’s not even clear if it increases the risk of prostate cancer (bad evidence suggests that it might increase cancer growth when already present). So I’m not sure if it’s a risk but we Don’t have good reasons to think that it is … What does it mean pratically ? For phosphatidylserine, I found no study in whi

176200859,"Someone asked about the forum guidelines on another thread so I thought it would be worthwhile to post a link to the Forum Guidelines as well as to other useful Forum Information. One thing I have noticed recently is that some users are regularly posting off-topic in threads that other folks have started. This falls under the forum guideline of “Keeping On Topic”. While everyone posts off topic sometimes – that’s to be expected in an internet forum where conversations evolve and flow – the issue arises when this becomes pervasive and disruptive. This is particularly concerning if the thread is on a serious topic where the thread’s Original Poster (OP) is asking for specific advice or is in distress. It is also quite disruptive if folks get into a spat and de-rail an entire thread in the process. My advice is to ignore another forum member if you find them annoying rather than engaging in a disruptive interaction. Another important forum guideline to keep in mind is “Suggestion, Not Cr
iticism”.

176200902,"Well I can’t change what the public thinks of the mentally ill by being cheerful and positive. Honestly the people here treat mentally ill people like crap. Or at least that is what I think. All my childhood and in junior high school I was either bullied or abused. And then after I came back to my home country people stare at me or frown because of my disability. I just can’t seem to accept the fact that there are good people around. I haven’t seen anyone who accepts the mentally ill as good people. A student recently just committed suicide because she got bullied after she posted in an online community to get help for her depression. THAT shows how cruel this society and this world are. Maybe this is my PTSD speaking but honestly I’ve lost faith in people by being abused for so long. It’s just like, I just can’t believe that people can be good. I suspect that I need to work on this with a therapist."

176200905,If you’re on a ketogenic diet it might help you. Because that diet is mostly fat. You wouldn’t be able to eat much in the way of carbs though. Other than that it’s a fat. It’s not a trans fat but it is saturated so don’t eat too much. Personally I’d rather have my fat in a tasty form like a nice coconut curry or butter chicken.

176200908,Meds don’t cause psychosis. I think you’ve a disconnect with your diagnosis and treatment. If you give people antipsychotics you’ll probably see movement disorders or parkinsons like symptoms. You wouldn’t see psychosis. If what you are saying is true then it’s against modern thinking and technology. I suspect your not that special and you’ve some issues for sure.
176200909,"I don’t know what I can do to prove you that I’m not doing this for attention. But thanks for pointing it out. If I am running on spoons and can’t reply, then I shouldn’t be making posts at all if I’m running on low energy. I’ll not make posts at all until I’m high on energy and can actually make a meaningful conversation with others without hurting everyone. I’m sorry I’ve hurt you in some way.

174393885,"I work for the federal government in the US. I was at work today and our agency has a main website that links articles and today the lead story was that my agency is one of the largest employers of people with disabilities and I read the article. It linked over 100 assistive and adaptive technologies and programs for disabled people. They were broken down in four categories. Blind or low vision, mobility issues, deaf or low hearing and learning disabilities. Not one mention of mental health or one program for it. I can’t think of any accommodations that I might need. I have enough sick time to go to appointments and I have a lot of them. I just know I am not even half the man I used to be. With going through probation and performance reviews it would be nice to have a safety net but I don’t think there is one. I can’t think of one accommodation I might need. I went back to school before I went back to work and I didn’t ask for any accommodations there either. I take tests really quickly and 
can learn. I graduated. Anybody have any ideas of accommodations a schizophrenic could ask for? I disclosed when I got hired that I had a serious psychiatric disorder although I didn’t specify which one."
176200926,Yeah I would contact your doctor _AT_MENTION_
176200927,I take 1mg klonopin every night for anxiety. It helps a lot

176200929,"I used to have a nursing agency that visited me for a couple of months, cleaning - preparing meals and that. And the odd outing around the area. But i got resentful for paying it outta my PIP - and in all honesty, im more than bloody capable of doing all that myself. I didnt want to become too reliant on them and “give up” just to veg on a sofa all day, whilst it was all done for me. And the fact i was scoring weed for the woman as well - which was counter-intuitive to my own well-being. So i binned them off. And i never paid the fees in the end either. It pissed off the social worker - after he done the paperwork for the part funding, but he turned out to be a fcking snowflake and left the service - there was no reliable care from him anyway, cos he was off sick every 5minutes. Unless im having a wobble - i purely see the CMHT for me jab once a month now."
176200930,"Try and look forward? Talk to your support network about your nightmares? I lack confidence as well - if your anything like me, its usually down to ruminating too much about the past and your anxiety playing up.

176200931,yea it’s a guessing game indeed… they guessed a lot to get me on the right meds eventually… i’m glad now with my meds but it took so long to get it right. Maybe if we had found it sooner i would be better of now.

I need a perfectly calm mind before I can even think of going out again. I’ve had it up to here (points to forehead) with the crazy. I can’t co-exist with it. Just want my normal life back.
176200935,I could sit around and ask “why did I get schizophrenia” over and over again but it doesn’t help anything. What’s done is done.

176200940,"_AT_MENTION_-Cotton Psychiatric labels may come and go, but unless properly treated your symptoms will very likely get worse. Do what is needed to be as well as possible. _AT_MENTION_ is a good example of someone who has gone from being very seriously mentally ill to someone who is a perfect example of what can be achieved with a good attitude and perseverance. Does he still have some symptoms? Yes - but he’s proactive in dealing with them."
176200941,It feels good to help for sure. I think it’s part of the healing process we are going through with this illness. Learning empathy and compassion for others who are suffering as well…

What if I get worse and have to be hospitalized. I see my psychiatrist early next week and I’m so confused I don’t know what to do? I guess I can live with sexual dysfunction. But I don’t know if I can continue with the negatives and weight gain. Ugh I’m so confused!

176200950,"I think also - that after many schizophrenics have experienced isolation for many months due to being unwell - are naturally gonna go down the pub for a bit of social. Having the odd beer down the bar - can have a beneficial effect, instead of locking yourself away indoors, with just the voices to do your head in. Its when you rely on the beer too much to cope with your feelings that it becomes a problem."

176200956,"Man, you seem to be overthinking things. I don’t know you and you may have always been this way, but in my case this was due to the illness. Are you on medication? Can you talk to your pdoc about your racing thoughts and maybe get a higher dose? The side effects are a pain, but worth it to have a calm mind."
176200957,"Grandiose delusions are a particular brand–they’re more commonly used to diagnose narcissistic personality disorder, provided they’re not too “out there” like psychotic delusions."

176200965,"Dr _NAME_, who led the research added: ""The association between 10 years of long work hours and stroke seemed stronger for people under the age of 50. This was unexpected.

Not sure what’s happening, but I feel really weird, and before I went to bed last night I had disturbances in my visual field with lots of colours and images floating around the room It took me ages to get to sleep, and I have been awake since 2am. I feel different. Like I am buzzing off ecstasy or something like that. I am not sure if this is because of my med reduction, or the long hours I have been putting in on my business Literally by the end of yesterday I was struggling to even type on my laptop What do you think based on the above? Is it exhaustion, or onset of a mild psychosis?"
174393883,"Geodon is 38% less effective than Risperdal. I hope that it will be enough for my positive symptoms and that my Dr accepts prescribing it. My Dr doesnt want to change my meds anymore, him and my parents say that I am best on Risperdal as I have no positive symptoms and no more serious anger issues, eventhough I have serious negative symptoms. The more positive symptoms the more I am irritable and can get violent."

176200970,Ok ive had this mouth sore that i thought was from my wisdom teeth biting my cheek like ive had before but now im thinking something is embedded in my mouth and causing all of this pain.

176200971,I don’t see what is a delusion about that?
176200972,IDK. If COVID wasn’t here you could go to any mall and see the absolute schmucks of every shape and form walking around with a girl on their arm. It has to give you a little confidence.
176200973,"_AT_MENTION_ _PERSON_ is correct. If you starve yourself, you body will go into panic mode and reserve fat instead of burn them off. I would suggest that you drink plenty of water, too because the body also preserves water because you don’t drink enough. Its just part of the balance. My suggestion is that how many calories you intend to eat, is that you eat smaller meals every three hours. It actually helps keep your blood sugars level so that you aren’t eating three heavy meals for your body to deal with. It’s just a suggestion. I believe it’s not healthy to starve. For me, I didn’t lose weight doing that and mentally I began to be afraid to eat. I was anorexic growing up, and I don’t want to go back to that. Good luck."
176200974,I got my paranoid schizophrenia from pot…figure it messes with me.
174393889,"Thank you kind sir. I enjoy our conversations as well. I like to venture outside the comfort zone and explore avenues less traveled. So many, with so many different experiences. I was introduced to this site via a link. I feel I can share, even my deepest pathological theories to an audience of understanding brethren. A gift from solitude. I value your company. Thank you."
176200975,Gotcha! Amazing pictures!
174393892,"hmmm. I wonder if Abilify causes that or if it’s more of a symptom of schizo-affective disorder, because I have bipolar tendencies but I have always had them no matter what medication I’m on and other medications don’t work like anti-depressants. The strattera seems to someone ease out the restlessness and feeling of needing to fill a void; it makes me happier. Or maybe it has to do with the way these meds work/by increasing dopamine and serotonin. No one really knows what causes schizophrenia. There have been ideas but they still don’t know. I am ok with it never going away and I’m glad the treatment helped with aspects of it. But I have also started looking into hypnosis and meditation/alternative therapies. The truth is anti-psychotics don’t cure schizophrenia so there may be other options to help you become stable. I’m open to the possibility there is more than one way to treat schizophrenia."

I can’t say for sure whether I would’ve turned out any different but I’m inclined to say I’d still be schizophrenic. To this day, large doses cause me to have more delusional thoughts. But I have found microdosing helps calm my anxiety and allows me to sleep without ramping up symptoms of SZ too much. I wouldn’t ever recommend it to others though."

174393899,"I had no support for ages as I used to hide everything from people, because I was ???? scared of being locked up for being crazy. I knew something was up, but I chose to hide it to protect myself - however it always got to the point that I would lose control When I was 17, they left me in the care of the youth offending team as I had a 12 month community rehabilitation order. The CMHT in 2004 was pretty much non-existent. I think I saw a psychiatrist once, and after two years I stopped the medication. Fast forward to 2011-12, I again was left for a very long time psychotic, and I scared the ???? out of the University counselling team and again I saw a psychiatrist, and got given Risperidone and Olanzapine and sent on my way In 2013 I stopped taking the pills, and had a major relapse and was sent from A&E back to my home town’s mental hospital. When I got discharged to CMHT, I discharged myself after two weeks as I hated the attention. Again, I wanted to keep things to myself, and being pensioned 
off on benefits was never going to happen, as I was adamant that I needed to work to keep busy. They were in the process of getting me supported housing before I told them where to go. in 2015 I realised the meds (Olanzapine 20mg) which I had been left on that dose for two years with no follow up had caused me to put on 35 kilos. Safe to say I went ape ????, and quit cold turkey. I learned about this illness - mainly from this site, as for those two years I just took the pills and had not developed any insight into my illness until this point, two years after a diagnosis of paranoid Schizophrenia. in 2016 we tried 3 meds, and I relapsed twice until we found that latuda helped me. I got discharged as soon as my symptoms were under control. I was very angry with the OT who was my care coordinator, as she betrayed me. Lifetime illness & part time care was unbelievable! 2017 I got akathisia, and I ended up quitting meds again, and back in the hospital. After I got released, the CMHT phoned me, and it was the OT w
ho discharged me, so I told her where to go. a few months later I had another relapse and this time I agreed to stay with the CMHT. It worked well as a psychiatrist took interest in me, and he was the one who I first met when I was 16/17. He got me therapy (Which was ????_USER_ID_?) and we found Amisulpride which has kept me stable since 2018. Since the CMHT have got me on PIP, Universal Credit capacity to work thing (I don’t understand this) and employment support services. My care coordinator now gets things done even though he doesn’t really listen. Oh yeah, and seeing as I have been in services on and off for 16 years, it took them until 2020 May to diagnose me with Autism and anxiety. Sorry for the long post. I wanted to let you know what I have been through with the CMHT as it has it’s problems. I do have a new psychiatrist who seems very good. He actually has called me off spec several times over the last few months, as I have been getting agitated, and causing some problems messing with my meds. 
I meet him for the first time in person on the 2nd Nov. Anyways, I will stop there. If you have any questions about what I have posted, feel free to ask"
176201009,Oh no I’m not but this incident is keeping me from moving on.it happened at the start and is one of the reasons I think it was real. It’s something which proves it was real to me so I need to disprove and try to rationalize it
176201010,"being that i am going on 63 i would like to add-on to what i have started, like be a better asst. librarian, read more etc etc. i’d also like to find some friends male and female. my experience being a sz most of my life has hindered me from education and accomplishments. this bothers me a whole lot. _NAME_"
176201011,Maybe it’s your heart. Go get checked
176201012,They say that they are god and are testing me but I failed and they say iam going to hell forever
176201013,One way. Sometimes I count four for all. Sometimes breathe in super deep and let out as slowly as possible. Sometimes dont count and just breathe.
176201014,Music has kept me alive I think. When I feel bad I listen music and it helps.
176201015,Exactly thats well written. Many media sources are.saying the same thing as you. Why would they pass this when so many people and advocacy groups are outraged. Thanks for replying I am really upset. When I’ve mentioned it people blow it off like what’s the big deal
174393898,I think Saphris is worth a try. I don’t have any side effects except sleepiness which the Rexulti counteracts.
176201016,_PERSON_ gift it to somebody.
176201017,Lol Good luck… Cotton.
176201018,"Made some salmon and creamed spinach (from frozen) for dinner last night: 20201001_0702273072×3072 2.12 MB The plate is small, so I can trick myself into thinking I’m eating more"
176201019,It’s disgusting _AT_MENTION_ . People are dying because they can’t afford their meds like chemotherapy etc. The makers are so selfish. Me me me! I really wish we could do something about it
174393901,Switching to abilify was better than others. Vyvanse helping a bit but it can cause psychosis so not ideal for everyone
176201020,"you are spot on.yeah harsh reality,thats i mean.i escape it.doesnt do me good though."
176201021,"That’s what happened to me as well. I need all my teeth drilled and filled, plus a crown. It’s unfortunate…but I’m looking forward to being able to smile again."
176201022,"Thankyou for sharing, I am happy to think that at least you are not distressed by your delusions, that’s good … do you ever feel like you are being watched? this is my newest delusion"
176201023,Thanks for your service! I also got my cdl in the army. I’m not sure how exactly. It was possibly from driving a big troop hauler truck or w/e they’re called.
176201024,I need to sort through my clothes to see what I want to keep or give away. Cleaning the kitchen is also a must for today; my mom usually does it and I want to give her a break.
176201025,I’m sorry this triggers you _AT_MENTION_
176201026,"All healthy meals, _AT_MENTION_ Lots of veg in your diet, which I’m going to try to incorporate in mine."
176201027,"Lost another pound this week, I’m down to 240. 28 pounds down since starting Zyprexa and 79 pounds total. I’m happy. I’m only 21 pounds from my short-term goal of 219 (100 pounds down from my max)."
176201028,I get them in my arms and legs mainly. I have to take procyclidine which pretty much hides it
174393904,“best erection pill” lol Its like Viagra?
176201029,"I’d question the ID more than the mental illness , but then you’d most likely end up with crap support for the mental illness by itself. I know a person,on a high IQ group I go on, who was given an IQ of 75.while in acute state of psychosis. He now gets scores that place him well into the 99th percentile."
176201030,"Dont take a risk buddy, its not worth it. I went to 2mg risperidone and I relapsed and lost almost everything I had. Being less smart is better than being full blown psychotic with a delusion thinking that you are reincarnated einstein"
176201031,"We’re having a snow day here. Roads look bad. It’s colder and windy. So I just sat around drinking cola and eating chicken wings. Then I vacuumed. Last night, I picked up the apartment around 10:30pm and straightened out my soda cans, to return for a refund."
176201032,That’s an option yeah. I’m just getting really bad akaithisia from the oral med and I really don’t think I could cope with having that sort of side effect for a month or longer if I got an injection
176201033,5 y ago i was still college student experienced student coz every year i failed once except the 1st year in the college i didt taste failure in that year 5 y ago i was in 5 th y of college which supposed to be only 5 years it was the last year i was experienced too much laughing people i become annoyed i was studying in the streets it was the last year i got the grade at the second term it was horrible year too much of self doubt too much suffer too much insisting untill i got the grade my doctor didnt think i ll get it coz i was not disciplined person as he see i should be i am now better but i returned to study in life long learning process as experts say everyone should be i hope it transform my life in little years sorry if there is any mistakes in wt i said
176201034,I’ve missed every point since 1989. Missing one more ain’t going to ruin me.
176201035,"I hope you’re right… I had a horrible hallucination and delusion about something along those lines I also wonder what if for some reason I’m not preserved. Idk how to stop these thoughts, _AT_MENTION_"
176201036,_PERSON_ I get euphoria occasionally but I’m not bipolar. My mum thinks I’m crazy when I get euphoric and tells me to stop being so stupid
176201037,Even if its true no one will kill you for those things.
176201038,"I started experiencing symptoms at 17 and was given the same NOS diagnosis. It is difficult to diagnosis initially and if I’m not mistaken to get the official diagnosis symptoms need to be present for 6 months or a year. I got mine at 18 even though nothing changed other than the length of time. As far as hospitalization goes, it is so hard to feel like the current inpatient system is really helping. I’m sorry you had such a bad experience I do understand how horrible that can be and I’m sorry you dealt with it, especially right at the beginning of your experience."
176201039,"I use to work for Walgreens and it was terrible! I’m using a local grocery store, Kroger, pharmacy and they won’t receive inventory until after the new year. I tried my county pharmacy but they keep saying either it is too soon to refill or they are closed. Even if I refilled it the day I run completely out it would take another week to refill it. And I’ve been noticing today that my emotions are getting mixed to the point that I’m frustrated with how everything is in my life right now, but I’m keeping everything in the front of my mind that things will be ok. I’m also having a lot of _NAME_. It’s freaking me out because that is the first sign of having a seizure. I’m kind of freaking out now, but not too badly. At least I have tomorrow off from work and I have some other antipsychotics left over from what I use to take. I guess once tomorrow comes I will just go ahead and take some left over Invega until I can get my geodon. As for the pharmacy you chose, I would suggest going thro
ugh either a local grocer pharmacy, even Walmart, or a private pharmacy. Those tend to be more on point with their patients than Walgreens or CVS because the other two literally only care about the money. Each in their own way but still, pretty bad."
176201040,I mean is there a reason for that?
176201041,"Yes, me too. I am frightened for no reason"
176201042,_AT_MENTION_ Thanks so much! Eager to connect! How are you?
176201043,Wow. I am really down right now. A lot of stuff they say about you in notes. One even said I look older than my age. That hits hard. And my delusio s plus truthful things that they acted like was a delusion…I really DID sue Canada Dry and just got my settlement this week! Not wvery single thing _PERSON_ was crazy!
176201044,I was on Lamictal for a while and I found it did not help at all with my mood swings. Switched to lithium and did much better.

174393906,I never thought that a med could give me addictions and hypersexuality. I guess chemicals can change our personality.

174393905,What if you went back on ability and watched the side effects? Would your doc allow it?
176201050,"Ah jeez the paranoia. Once during my first episode, I was in a restaurant and someone walked in wearing “World famous” tshirt, it freaked me out. I thought it was about me."
176201051,Glad your working with your medical peeps. Maintaining for a period sounds a solid plan just to see how you go. It’s only for a period anyways so you can do that.

176201053,Volunteer work is the best way I know to connect with people who share your interests and who care about other people. Quite often these are high quality connections that can advance you socially and professionally.
176201054,Don’t waste your time. I went off meds for 2 years trying all sorts of holistic / alternative stuff. I just ended up psychotic and back in hospital. There are things that can help a bit in addition to an AP. But certainly not in place of one.
176201055,Here in Canada packages from AliExpress China take 5-7 months to arrive.

176201057,"Ok, thank you _USER_ID_… maybe I became a tough person…I know that it’s not easy for you too… Unfortunately, I was sick since kid and I ended up by becoming sick around my father… idk if its genetic though… he was beating my mother and my sister… idk what played that I am sick for all my past… I also ignore why the meds dont “open” my mind… it feels like I need this…"
174393907,I just got a letter through the post saying they are denying me PIP. I think it is a bit outrageous that they make people in this country who have schizophrenia live without this. I just worked out how much I get in total off my remaining benefits and it puts me below the national poverty line. It’s beyond a joke.
176201058,"There have been times when I wished I had walked out the door, gotten a job, and become self supporting. I might have had to bed down on the street a few times, but I’ve done that a few times now, and, while dangerous, it isn’t that bad. It would probably be dangerous for you to go out among the elements now, because you’re probably on antipsychotic medication. They disrupt your body’s temperature regulation mechanisms, so that you would be more susceptible to heat stroke in summer and hypothermia in winter. Your body couldn’t withstand the weather, and that would take a lot of job possibilities away from you."

I guess I’m pigging out."

174393912,My diagnosis goes from bipolar to schizoaffective - back and forth. Currently my psychiatrist and therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder.
176201065,It sounds very like the way I heard avoidant personality disorder characterized. You might investigate that. Maybe if they know what the problem is they can fix it.

176201067,Are you going to try it?
176201068,It’s beautiful!!!
176201069,I can identify with that _AT_MENTION_ it’s scary indeed I’m so afraid sometimes because I’m scared I’d obey the evil and do something I don’t really want to. Fortunately the meds help with that to some degree
176201070,Haha I’m good thanks _USER_ID_. Fortunately I have klonipin prn with me I gotta go to work now. That would calm me down if I need it. Peace. I’m good tho.

176201072,"Well few doctors are prescribing the new tests and thinking about it in the new light. As I said inertia. Remember the standard of practice for sz used to be lobotomy. And before the discovery of H. Pylori bacteria gastrointestinal ulcers were treated with surgery. If you want more information about the mechanisms of how lipoproteins and atherosclerosis work, there is a lot of information out there. Basically it has everything to do with metabolism, and improving metabolism through dietary means/exercise lowers risk. Of course the right diet for improving metabolism is itself a can of worms, but take a look at the _PERSON_ and Dr. _NAME_ (he’s a cardiologist) youtube channels. That’s not to say that statins are not needed for some people, it’s just that the determination whether they’re actually needed for a patient is in most cases the old standard test which may not be enough. Controversial."

176201074,"Yesterday, I found out that a good friend from high school died. We hadn’t spoken in years, but we were always on very good terms with each other. He overdosed, they don’t know if it was intentional. I’m pretty torn up inside. I hate knowing that he must have felt absolutely alone, and probably never knew how much he meant to me. We were both kind of outsiders in our friend group, and he went out of his way to make me feel included and accepted. He made high school more bearable. I wish I had bothered to tell him how much he changed my life during my formative years. I don’t know if it would have made a difference, in the end. Now I will have to live the rest of my life never telling him. If you are feeling all alone, or like nobody cares, your depression is lying to you. There is always someone who you mean a lot to. They might not have told you, because we live in a society where people just don’t say those things. But trust me, someone cares deeply for you, and will feel absolutely gut

174393921,"During recent studies of relapse in schizophrenia that we conducted [10-12], we were struck by several observations: Relapse rates are very high after treatment discontinuation, even after a single episode of psychosis. A longer treatment period prior to discontinuation does not reduce the risk of relapse. Many patients relapse very soon after treatment discontinuation. The transition from remission to relapse may be abrupt, with few early warning signs. Once illness recurrence occurs symptom severity rapidly returns to levels similar to the initial psychotic episode. While most patients respond promptly to re-introduction of antipsychotic treatment after relapse, the response time is variable and _NAME_ treatment failure may emerge in a subset of patients.

Idk if I’m imagining it but it would makes me feel extremely neurotic I’d I were to be very open with her. So I don’t. I mean I bought a pizza yesterday and she got really angry and disappointed at me it really stresses me out. It triggers flashbacks from when she was in my head aswell. This is maybe going to sound extremely bad to you guys but I think when she passes away I will feel better :(.

174393929,"Hi. I think one important thing you could tell your parents is that drug-induced psychosis is actually a disorder that requires treatment, similar to the treatment for schizophrenia. It does not go away on its own. I would also like to add that having primarily tactile hallucination is very uncommon, and that the way you describe it sounds more like a sensory processing issue, which would point more towards autism/ADHD. Having auditory hallucinations that are just background conversations of people muttering is a sign of tinnitus, more often than schizophrenia. I don’t think you necessarily should jump to the conclusion of schizophrenia. It is also almost impossible for a minor to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia. If you have a psychotic disorder, odds are you will get one of dozens of other, less permanent disorders. Drug-induced psychosis is a good bet, if you have done drugs. The good news with that is, it is usually temporary. If you stick to your treatment for a full 1-2 years, you can usual
ly be weaned off the meds with no lasting effects."
176201115,looks very pretty _AT_MENTION_ . Keep up the good work.

174393930,"A recent study into the genetic of right and left handedness found a link between being left handed and schizophrenia and bipolar. It’s only mentioned once in the article, but made me wonder how many of us are lefties. I’m left handed, but weirdly.

176201122,_PERSON_ I have no problem using sampled stuff I do enjoy producing a lot but there are times I need breaks for sure. Getting back into it after tho is really fun
176201123,I used to think that I was followed and monitored by the secret service of China. But I no longer think that way since I took antipsychotics. I guess you were delusional about this guy who was watching you.
176201124,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_. That must worry you

My current list is like 4 years long and ive been on it over 2 years i think. Its really nice because its for mentally ill people only…but im not really able or ready for it. Just a back up plan…

176201137,welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_
176201138,Ldopa helped my negative symptoms. Wellbutrin also increases dopamine but I read it does only in the prefrontal cortex. Its an antidepressant that doesn’t work on serotonin.
176201139,"Sounds like a very cathartic post. I got addicted to crack in 1986. Did a lot of drinking and blow too. I got addicted pretty quickly and then crack became the biggest focus in my life. Spent almost all my money on it. Got ripped off and cheated fairly frequently. The city I mostly got my crack from was a rough and tough place. Where you never knew who was going to pull stuff like being car jacked or kidnapped. Sold almost everything I owned for a pittance of crack. I smoked it for four years and my lifestyle was just shitty those four years because of the crack. But I got clean in 1990 through AA, CA and NA. Best thing I ever did in my life for myself. I got clean and sober than got a job, went to school and eventually lived independently and got a car. Getting clean totally changed my life. I’m only telling you this because I was kind of in your shoes. It sounds like you want to improve yourself but I bet crack is derailing your efforts. Your self sabotaging yourself with drugs . Not many peopl
e on coke and crack make successful lives and schizophrenia makes it a hundred times worse. Getting clean might solve problems for you to live a happy and healthy life."
176201140,Thanks for the feedback _AT_MENTION_ I took your advice and toned down the reverb on the snare. In my super amateur rap experience I feel like it makes the beat way easier to just go off on. Appreciate it a bunch dude!
176201141,We had a lovely time. had a iced mocha. We sat outside and enjoyed looking at all the green trees on main street. Then on the way back to my place she took me to the grocery store to pick up some zucchini so I can make some pumpkin zucchini muffins today. Yum. I’m going to have the grandbabies over later and I’ll be able to give that to them for snack. I think they’ll really like it.
176201142,Let me tell you more about peer support specialist and what I do. In order to become a pss in San _NAME_ you have to take a WRAP class and then go through a two week class room situation at RI International. It’s not too challenging. Here in California they don’t have a certification process yet so we don’t have to take a test through the government yet. But we’re working on getting that certification process done so that we can get paid more and the position will be more professional I guess you could say. In most states in the USA there is a certification process and one has to take that test to get certified. I don’t think one has to go back to college to get trained to be a pss. Hope that helps. If you have any questions let me know.
176201143,Hugs)))) 1555444
176201144,Walk my brothers dogs. Do some grocery shopping. I want to visit my sacred neigh but don’t know if I will get there today.miss her.adore her.love her most.she is the platonic love of my life. My heart has been hurting lately.it hurts on and off.

176201149,That sounds like it sometimes gets in the way of your life. Do you talk about it in therapy?
176201150,How did you made this piece?What kind of color tools did you use?It’s great!
176201151,"Hey, you’ve got a math brain. Maybe teaching this old nerd some math will help you pass the time. Performing a task succesfully will get me 0.17 points. About 87% of the tasks are successful. So my questions are: How do calculate how many tasks I’d need to succeed at to reach 900 points? If the number of succesful task is 87%, how do I calculate what’s 100%? In orher words, to succeed at enough tasks to reach 900 points with an 87% success rate, how many tasks would I need to perform? If we say I have 26 days to reach those 900 points, how many tasks would I need to succeed at per day on average?"
176201152,I am sure you will find something that works for you.
176201153,"Can you link up with the people who gave you the glowing references on LinkedIn? Can you send a message to the references asking if you can still use them as a reference? I still use old, glowing references, but I’m _PERSON_ with the people who gave them to me, so the employer can see that I’m still in touch with them, they are still familiar with me, and they are still willing to recommend my skills. It seems to help. Actually, I think an old reference can be better than a new one. Have you ever seen this question on an application? “How long have you known this person?”"
176201154,I like it. I feel way more comfortable and safe.
176201155,_AT_MENTION_ what do you think about taking amyloban every second day after awhile? Would save some money if it worked like that
176201156,Our doctors study us and write books and keep statistics. But that is as far as it goes. We are all studied so that they can find better treatment for sz and the others diseases.
176201157,Talking with my kids. Hearing them laugh. Hearing them say they love me. Helping them with homework. Going places with them. Seeing them smile. Really I just love everything about them.
176201158,Google says nausea is a common side effect of botj drugs
174393931,"Sadly they’re not. They’re really sz negative symptoms. I don’t have depressive thoughts. I tried Wellbutrin for 6 weeks, it just made me slightly worse. I am stuck. I had slightly less negative symptoms on lower AP dose but had some positive symptoms. I guess I can try Geodon for a week or two if my psychiatrist allows me. On Latuda I had slightly less negative symptoms but had some positive symptoms."
176201159,I’m not sure but you should definitely let your pdoc know just in case
176201160,"For me, its the little successes, smiling when i dont have any reason, just let a smile come to your face Cooking, cleaning, the little successes are everything. We are not guaranteed tomorrow and so their is no future planing, only now, and if you live years, you would of accomplished so much simply by focusing on one day at a time. I believe the preferred notion of success is actually crippling, it turns you into a zombie of accomplishments rather than experiencing the novelty, do it for the sake of passing the time and over time it will be something huge."
176201161,If I could i would go back to smoking weed
176201162,"Sometimes when my delusions get bad like that, I remember it’s not the things that are happening in my head that are the issue, but the feelings they are evoking. Do you feel the same way about different things that have happened in your life? It might be a good time to honour those feelings and feel okay for feeling them. Even so, please call your therapist or pshrink when you can and let them know. It is so painful to be terrorised like that, and we all know how you feel. You are not alone in this struggle. Did something happen, or do you think it’s your meds?"
176201163,_PERSON_ this is incredible
176201164,Oh yeah I also vaped with a friend cbd ejuice and cbd crystals.
176201165,I wish I could help… Hope things get better for you Earthchild you seem like a wonderful person
176201166,"I thought soup would be doable as far as not wanting to spit it out, but that means taking a trip to the grocery store. I’m not ready for interactions with people now. It was a rough night between being overly tired and my first full psychotic episode in a while. The episode was mild thankfully but it certainly didn’t help."
176201167,what happened that you broke up
176201168,"I feel blunted, I know my emotions aren’t as strong as they used to be. I can still recognize them, But it can take me a bit to sort them out."
174393936,I try really hard but can’t seem to force myself to do things like shower.

176201170,"I agree to the most degree…I don’t mind the ankle monitor so much anymore (had it 2.5 weeks now) and can see things better from other perspectives now, but I still think she’s a lousy doctor. She told them in court that she was getting hang up calls and someone stole her license plate and she thinks it was me (it definitely was not). She’s paranoid…so was i, but my meds and therapy are good now. I’m way calmer. I still don’t get why they didn’t just arrest me in April, tho…"
176201171,I have heard “Be thankful in adversity.” I thought that was silly until I realized it is humbling.
176201172,_AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ can y’all explain a little bit of what that is?
176201173,You closing threads without ever getting to the bottom of the discussion that is exactly what I was talking about in describing you… I don’t care about your personal information … least bothered. If all you want is rainbow unicorn threads where people vent out their frustrations about their lives as to how their meds are treating them badly blah blah blah… and u guts think u doing some social service by indulging their innocence then please count me out if this ????????.
176201174,Man I feel a change coming. I’m starting to feel antsy and pissed. Idk why and depressed. I should feel happy. I’m not in a ward
176201175,try to do something that relaxes you and see if it gets better.
176201176,macaroni mango marshmallow meat mustard
176201177,This has been also a thing that I have struggled to sort out in my head how my own MI plays into this scenario.
176201178,I also find it very helpful to say that I am trying my best.
176201179,heavy dose of what? You should always take your meds as prescribed by your pdoc.
176201180,It’s obvious you are delusional.

176201190,I always double check my apples for rottenness Pears I like but I usually don’t get them
174393937,Out of those I’d say Vraylar. Rexulti is just abilify under a new name so they could make more money. And for me at least latuda didn’t do anything. I take Invega which is the best I’ve been on.

176201193,To stop hating myself
176201194,Ok… my therapist described schizophrenia like a shroom trip…lots of people seem to be using shrooms lately too…not good…
176201195,Many ppl think its a psychological issues and not a medical disease. They’re completely wrong.
176201196,My doc said I have sza

176201198,I’m out of cigarettes. What could I smoke instead?
176201199,"Yes, the gas station was a part-time side job. I was working just 1-2 midnight shifts per week. The extra money was helpful, but I just can’t do it anymore."
176201200,Get Tumblr account. Very relaxed community where you can find your own niche and vibe in it.
176201201,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ they don’t make things easy do they!
176201202,"I wouldn’t say that. But every person has a treshhold for how much nutrients they can handle. Like I have heard of other people taking high doses of niacin for years and for them it is no problem, but for others like me it becomes toxic at much lower doses. Just have to listen to what the body tells us. I am back on B-vitamins now, but I only take them about twice a week which seems to work fine for me. If something feels off, it is worth considering that drugs and/or supplements could be responsible, and that a adjustment could be in order."
176201203,I like the Samsung watch I found . . . trying to see if it works with an older iPhone.

176201206,"My parents were exposed last week, they’re going to self quarantine and now my dad is showing symptoms. I’m super worried about them, I hope they’re okay."
176201207,WHAT why would I care?
174393954,can you touch them piano gal?
176201208,"Not to be jelly but if I was one of y’all non-voice hearers to start, I’d consider myself in full remission right now. It’s literally my only residual positive symptom. I think delusions are worse though for what it’s worth. Voices can’t do as much damage if you’re not delusional, but they do wear away at your sanity if you go several days without a break."
176201209,I laugh hysterically sometimes.
176201210,"Conservatives want to hold on to their wealth no matter how badly everyone else is doing. They’d rather let others starve to death than offer a small portion of what they have to those in need. All that phrase “we don’t offer a hand out but X” is is doing is trying to make them appear more compassionate and rational for not caring about other human beings’ lives. Of course job creators are important, but why can’t you do both? Oh yeah because it doesn’t suit your interests."
174393945,Serotonin improving drugs also reduces negative symptoms but carries several side effects. Some can even go manic by it.
174393947,Do you spend much time doing nothing? I try to keep myself occupied but spend a lot of time staring into space laying on my bed. Don’t know if it’s negative symptoms. Getting bored of it.
174393946,It’s a tough thing. My depression is big and my negatives are shite. I lived through both. For the depression I take a boat load of effexor. 300mgs which is on the high side! For my negatives I’ve started exercising. It really does make a difference. They both feed each other so it’s important to sort it all out!

176201212,It’s probably something you feel more like doing when it’s cooler. Maybe as Fall comes on you’ll get back into it. I think you like to make things for people right?
176201213,Don’t give up _AT_MENTION_ . Take things day to day and stay on your meds.
176201214,Is this paranoia?
176201215,My problem is that I can’t end antipsychotica and psychiatry. I have told them that im doing much better without.
174393951,"The dr overseeing my care the last time I was hospitalised said I had paranoid and I have a strong case of negative symptoms (or more so cognitive, I’m not sure which is which half the time anymore)"
176201216,Would that be so terrible?
176201217,I relate to this very much so.
176201218,Great news. Hospital is horrible. Nothing to do all day and surrounded by delusional people. Not a good environment for recovery.
176201219,"I know nothing about basketball, but I’ve always liked _NAME_ because he carried himself with dignity. He didn’t let his success ruin him and make him eccentric. He also does some spectacular slam dunks."
176201220,Yes. I deeply feel others pain
176201221,It also feels like electronics or quantum mysticism or magic.

176201225,I had the symptoms of depression.
176201226,I feel like everyone is trying to figure me out but I just think it’s all true. Feel like I have to wait 10 years to see if it’s not.
176201227,"hi far cry, how r u doing"
174393958,It is a good med for positive symptoms. Just watch out on what you eat. Please keep us updated. What med have you try?
176201228,Thanks for the reply’s. My step aunt is trying to get me out of the picture. She’s trying to turn my (grandma) step grandma against me. She was married to my grandfather before I was born. She was married to him for 30 years. It was his wish my mom and aunt get this house. But my grandma’s niece is coming at me. I think she’s trying to pin a fraud case on me. My paranoia isn’t helping the situation. For years my grandmother didn’t want anything to do with her family. Now with alzheimers she’s invited them back into our lives.
176201229,"i wouldnt want to be off the meds, as id go carazy again."
176201230,"Honestly last week I was driving to pick up medicine for the kids, and I just couldn’t handle going back and dealing with their needs again, so I just parked the car, sat on the side of the road, and blasted music for a half hour."
176201231,"Depends, if they’re voices then you need to distance yourself and whatever consciousness in you that understands that they’re false and fake needs to be encouraged. These voices are just bull they’re not real, they have no insight into the inner workings of reality. If you’re having thoughts about euthanasia and her passing peacefully consult a therapist. Either way I wish you and your grandma the best."
176201232,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ it’s nice to think that might be true. But the rejection from the online course is a first for me. That’s rather depressing I know it’s up to me, I just thought some guidance might help"
176201233,When I didn’t take it yesterday my eyes started to flicker on and off. I feel hella Disassociated and wonky as you describe. And an eery feeling that my brain isn’t working properly. And feelings of HPPD from shrooms. When I take my meds I feel none of this… and skipping them 10 hours later I feel all of this. Yesterday was the longest I went without naltrexone since I started it in dec of 2015. My brain started to feel mechanical and the naltrexone makes me feel as if fairies are flying throughout my brain. (In a good way). Something magical about that med for me and it’s crazy!!! Glad we found the right combos!! Thank god im an alcoholic and not just a shrooms addict. Otherwise never would’ve found this naltrexone and I’d still hella be suffering.
176201234,A body like that only takes a full body workout once a week for about 2 to 3 hours. I know this cos I’ve worked out on and off over the past 7 years. Unfortunately my shoulder injury has prevented my progress but a year or two of working out once my shoulder is fixed and I could defo get that body.
176201235,Nice poem ! Cant wait for more.

176201243,All you have to do is listen to people’s tone when they talk and question how much of them is being authentic vs how much of it is based on factors that are determined by what others want them to be. i.e. It requires developing a sort of feeling perception. It’s extremely terrifying if you’re not prepared.

There’s a reason they’ve been shooting people up with Haldol in the psych units for forever."

176201257,"Thank you. I hope we can both overcome this. I had therapy today. My therapist wants to see more often than just once a month now. She doesn’t think I’m in crisis, and I don’t think I am either, but she does want to monitor me more closely since my symptoms are giving me more trouble than they were during my last appointment, and I appreciate her for that. I’ll keep cooperating and going like my boyfriend keeps urging me to, lol."
174393957,I’m on clozapine and it makes my mind feel more ‘basic’ makes me wonder if long term this crap is really helping me and just how bad my mind is being fried from all these pills… It’s a sad state of affairs when you envy and wonder how a normal person feels…

176201264,Maybe they wanted you on a different drug at the lowest dose possible? They wanted to see if it would work. Maybe thats why they told you a story.

176201269,en.m.wikipedia.org Symbolic boundaries Symbolic boundaries are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by cultural sociologists. Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.” Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries. _PERSON_ saw the symbo...
176201270,"This way of seeing things is far less grandiose than beleiving in in garden variety delusions. One of the biggest hurdles in treating schizophrnia is taking away a patients feeling of being supernatural or superhuman. Given the choice, the average patient prefers to beleive they have supernatural powers over being a normal human being with a mental illness."

I have been out of the industry for the most part since I got sick in 2008. It’s 2020 almost 12 years later. Opportunity may not knock again. I have to try it. She says I won’t make it.
174393979,positive symptoms and negative symptoms. But I feel they are just describing psychosis again with a few things added on top. But they should be just saying it is psychosis and labeling the other stuff as schizophrenia.
174393980,"Its just for depression my psychiatrist said, not for schizophrenia. He refused to prescribe it for my severe negative symptoms. He gave me Wellbutrin but it didnt work in my case, maybe it will work for you."

176201322,"I’ll tell you one thing. The fact that you are fighting every day, you are on here still fighting, no matter how hard it is, and we know it’s hard, but you are a true warrior. I’m in pain right now but I know you are in more pain than I am. I want to encourage you with all sincerety to never give up hope. Never! It WILL pay off, because when you are in so much pain there’s so much goodness to be felt. There’s so much life that you have to experience still. It’s not over, does not matter how long, your pain will decrease. I truely believe. I spent 6 years in misery, not nearly as long as you, but 6 years I was nothing. Just a person in a room. I become so overweight, my online escape was online video games. I would feel so numb from the meds, I wouldn’t talk to anybody. I wouldn’t want to be around my family. Most days I didn’t ever believe I would ever have a life worth living. But like you at least my animal instinct told me to keep on pushing through the pain, because it’s the 
only option. There is no other option than to keep fighting, truely. Meds yes, always keep trying variety of meds. But yes at some point there’s other things we must do. I started slowly letting go of things that were hurting me, even though they helped me for a long time. I let go of junk food, fast food, all sugar. My mind started to become more clear. I started intermittent fasting, not eating breakfast and no snacks, etc. I started to lose the weight, I started to like myself again. I started to believe in myself again. I quit the video games, it took me a long time and I didn’t have anything right away to replace them with but I said I’m done. I’m not going to waste my life away in a fake world. I WILL at least do something that will fulfill me. I started playing music. I started learning a foreign language. I finally got back into college part time. It was a lot, and is a lot of work, and it’s very hard, but my life is better. I say this to encourage you, to keep fighting and do whatever you c
an outside of meds to help you. Do whatever it takes. Even if it means no dessert ever again or junk food (it’s so hard I know but it has helped me so much.) Anything you can do, do it! I believe in you!"
176201323,"This thread is strangley interesting - yet it feels horrific, who in the merry hell wants to be Psychotic?"
176201324,"Good luck. However if you put the effort into it that you say you will luck will have less to do with whether you succeed or not. However I must say that in my case I could put the same efforts into some subjects and fail, and much less effort into others and succeed. If you find you can’t remember anything you read half-way through your prep time try something else. It is smart to watch out for your mental health too. When I went back to school I took the right subject but didn’t keep mentally healthy."
176201325,"There was a part of the old testament found with a reference to the number of the beast, and it was actually 616, not 666. 666 is some hollywoodised version of that number.

Why don't you sum the distance to the stars or calculate the speed of light in this time? You have a huge capacity for juggling numbers. Something more useful. I know numbers are interesting but what you have is loose associations at best. There is love for someone like you. Find that love, it is above. Do you sleep OK? Are you hungry? Maybe you should sacrifice your drivers license for your wellness. You seem brilliant but focus on your life and what is needed in your village. Maybe someone will drill you a well or bring food to the poor. What else can you talk about, yourself, numbers, meds. Life. What is it like in your village in Poland?

Because I’ve been out of hospital for nearly 6 years , my psychiatrist (and myself) are very reluctant to mess with success by changing meds. So I’m stuck. There is no more progress to be made. Which is a bit of a downer."

176201385,"Hi _AT_MENTION_. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant.

Once I developed schizoaffective disorder and actually needed the Seroquel for hallucinations, the akathisia started… a side effect from being on an antipsychotic for five years straight before sza. In short, nobody should take an AP for bipolar unless they’re hallucinating or have delusions.

I listen to and read books, listen to podcasts, work on different languages, work as a cashier, invest in stocks, post on this website, talk to friends, socialise when I get a chance and basically have maintained stability for about a year and a half. It was very bad in the beginning but I managed to hang in there and with time things have gotten a lot better and now I’m enjoying life. I still have memory problems and sleep a lot but other than that I’ve made a lot of improvement. I also got hit with depression after my psychosi

No one else wanted it because it’s very low hours, 5 a week. But I can’t handle a lot of hours.

176201513,"In Hong Kong, the Chinese name if directly translated to English, is “Perception Sensory Disorder”. I think that is a name that describes the underlying chracteristics of schizophrenia well. It also has a much less serious connotation. Branding and naming can be important towards reducing _USER_ID_. In old days, intellectual disabilities are referred to “????????” in 1960s. Before that it was called idiot and imbecile. By calling the name intellectual disabiltiies, people would see the illness as less serious and it is also less likely to be used as an insult."

176201517,"You should check out MWI (many worlds interpretation) and quantum immortality. simple.wikipedia.org Quantum immortality Quantum suicide is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics and the philosophy of physics. It was originally claimed that it can distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is based on imagining oneself as the cat in the _PERSON_ cat thought experiment. Quantum immortality refers to the experience of surviving quantum suicide. The thought experiment was created by _PERSON_. In the thought experiment,... And: en.wikipedia.org Many-worlds interpretation The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts that the universal wavefunction is objectively real, and that there is no wavefunction collapse. This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some ""world"" or universe. In contrast to some other interpretations
, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, the evolution of reality as a whole in MWI is rigidly deterministic.:8–9 Many-worlds is also called the In many-...

174394019,"Hi, I haven’t posted in a little while. I had gotten a handle on the voices for awhile and I thought my medication was working. Things were going well, I was hardly bothered by them at all. I even was able to forget that the girl was reading all of my thoughts and could think normally again. I don’t know what happened. Slowly, they started creeping back in my head, getting louder and louder every day and bothering me more and more throughout the day. It started getting really bad again last night. They woke me up and immediately started with their ????????. This time, it wasn’t just the girl in my head, but her friends too. I’m not sure how many, it sounded like a few guys and another girl. The other girl’s voice isn’t usually an issue, but the other people are driving me crazy. They have been in my head ever since really early this morning and have been harassing me ever since, nonstop. They keep telling me how disgusting I am, how ugly and fat I am, how I need to just kill myself. As 
I was calling my psychiatrist, they started saying how the psychiatrist wouldn’t be able to help me, and that I should just go ahead and kill myself now. They keep telling me how much more beautiful the other girl is than me (in my delusion, she is my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend who he has been cheating on me with for the last four years and she has been trying to break us up the entire time by turning him against me and getting him to hate me) and how she would be a better mother to my boyfriend’s and my daughter. They have been telling me how I’m a horrible mother and horrible person. Usually I can tune them out pretty well and they don’t affect me. I have gotten really good at not reacting or showing (or feeling, for that matter) any emotion. I don’t know what is different about today, but it’s really bringing me down today. I feel absolutely terrible right now. I feel so bad about myself and feel like it’ll never stop. I called my psychiatrist and left a voicemail, she should call me back so
on. I feel like I need to try a different medication, but she keeps just upping my dosage of Latuda. I’m maxed out on the Latuda at 120mg and it honestly isn’t helping at all anymore. It might be making them a little quieter, but they’re just as persistent if not moreso recently. I hope she will prescribe something different to try. I have tried Abilify and then the Latuda so far. I’ve only been dealing with these voices for the past three years, so it’s still relatively new for me. The thoughtbroadcasting started very recently, maybe 6mos ago, or a little longer. The thought broadcasting is what causes me the most distress. I have no privacy and have had to learn to control and filter my thoughts, out of fear of thinking something stupid. It’s terrible. My head is so messed up right now. Does anyone have any insight or advice on how to handle the voices when they get this negative and persistent? I’m trying to take care of my 3 year old daughter and am having trouble concentrating on her. It’
s affecting my patience with her and making me feel very out of it and distracted. I know it’s so unfair to my daughter, she just wants to play with me and I keep telling her, “later,” and letting her use the iPad. I know it’s horrible of me. Maybe I am a horrible mother. Maybe they’re right. I just feel so guilty for not playing with her more right now and I feel like I’m ignoring her, but I can’t focus on anything else. I just want the voices to stop so badly. I’ve had enough. I don’t think I need to go to the hospital, but if it keeps getting worse, I might consider it. I just have to be home to take care of my daughter during the day, when her grandma and aunt are working so I can’t be locked up in the psych ward. Someone please help me I’m so f-_NAME_ up right now."

176201562,They just wanted something. Kinda scared me.
176201563,_AT_MENTION_ I dunno why. I just want to include you in this. Good thing. I dont see the shadow creatures at work. When I first developed symptoms they were only at home then they started following me around. But now I’m symptomatic again and again they are only seen at home. I think if I’m careful then they will stay at home. I hear them at work but if I calm myself down then they go away. I used to not be able to make them go away like that. I dont have any irrational thinking. I dont fear that people are after me or that people are after the ones I care about. That’s good. So it’s a lot different then the first time and that’s good.
176201564,Sorry for your loss _NAME_. I don’t know how I could cope with such a loss. Wishing you much love. I am living with family now but am soon moving into a apartment by myself. I will live there by myself and maybe adopt a dog. There is only one man my heart has clicked with and I’ve had extatic lovemaking with.he was kinky but I’m ok with that as long as I can say no if I want to to some things.i was really Pi ssed off at him so I was not thinking about him but now I wonder if I would move to Sweden if he would marry me or live with me but he is a meat eater and drinks alcohol I think and I rather my partner be a sober vegan but he is the only one I have ever felt that way with n for but I did not even mention him on marriage thread I wrote but if I was to marry a man I know it would be him because I would not want to marry a friend just which my other boyfriends have been really as such. Thankfully I will have family not too far away so I can probably go to them if I need help with anything. I 
would live with someone again possibly. Depends.
174394030,"I told my friends about This but I wanted to share here. A couple days ago i ran into a person I talk to sometimes. We got on the topic of my mental health. I mentioned that it wasn’t depression I have, as they asked how my depression was, but schizophrenia. I didn’t want to try to explain how schizoaffective works. Her eyes got big and she goes "" you don’t act likeit. You’re not out setting fires and carving crosses in stuff"" Um, what?! We do have a few very ill people in our area and folks get shipped to our hospital that are really off. But still. I just told her I’m typical. I’m thinking I should maybe tell more people so they see we’re not all dangerous. I’m afraid of some responses. But if I keep hiding it then no one will be educated. I already have 3 people who learned that sz doesn’t mean dangerous."

176201576,"Don’t look at the scale. Track your body on how your clothes fit. If you diet for too long you might experience binge eating, hating the gym, and hormonal issues. Spend over 6 months in a building phase. Restore function of metabolism. Once you fuel your body you build muscle. You can stay at the same weight for a year, but look completely different. To get to that next level you need to eat more calories and get stronger. People who boost calories for a while then get into a fat burning phase experience greatest results.

Alcohol is cunning baffling powerful which you prob already know. But what you might be forgetting is those who say: “I didn’t get into trouble every time I drank; but every time I DID get in trouble there was drinking involved”. What keeps me up at night is the concept of falling asleep outside during the cold months. But so did you give in? It’s healthier to admit and start a new sobriety.

However, there is a great need for alternatives, and research is looking at other targets along the brain's metabolic pathways. Lack of glycine... Betaine comes from a normal diet but is also synthesized in the body where it contributes to metabolism in various ways, including as an anti-inflammatory agent.

176201641,"Just a few months ago I had another strange experience. Set and setting: out and about with my mother and father we found ourselves in the basement of an unfurnished home of my 2nd cousin. What went down: Me already feeling a bit strange; talking with my parents and cousins, I tell ya what. When I say time stopped, I mean that time literally froze around me… the air froze in place and I was ejected out of my body. Standing still in this foreign land that surrounds me, I look around and see my parents but it’s hard to see clearly as an electrostatic look took over my vision of everything. I could even see the air in front of me make a little storm but without the clouds. I feel this immense lightness in my movements and I felt free of my shackled body. I look back at my dad and he’s standing still, even his face was in the middle of speaking but still frozen. An electrostatic body started to form behind him and I SAW… I saw a figure made of electricity put its hand on my fathers shoulder as 
it stood behind him… I looked it dead in the face, for it had no eyes, ears or mouth. As I gazed at the creature hold my fathers shoulder, it stared directly at me. I’m not sure how but it did. Me feeling more strange by the second, this place I have found myself in feels familiar. Like a second nature home to me, yet I am in an unimaginable place. Standing still the creature flashes out of existence and I feel a rumbling in my head as I’m torn back into my body and time continues. My mother looks in my direction and gives me a sign to go upstairs… she tells me I look like I’ve seen a ghost and I’m pale as can be… later my dad comes to me and says “I’m not sure why… but I had this feeling to touch the wires in the light socket but something told me not to.” Then I told him the event I had just seen and the rest is history… this is a real event that I experienced… Let me know what y’all think"

176201660,Something bad happening to my kids.
174394045,"First of all, this is posted in the Unusual beliefs section even though it is not my belief (as far as I am aware) that it’s possession, it’s just a theory. It seems I am unable to believe in anything, unless my condition wants me to believe in something. I can’t even be paranoid, because I’m unable to think. Anyway, the thread’s topic seems unusual enough, and here it goes. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. My body seems to move by itself (feels like moving itself). That includes doing everyday things and writing this thing - everything my body does seems to happen by itself rather than me doing it by will. Rein no longer seems to have control over his own body. It is as if he is possessed by some demon or spirit, and I am that spirit who possesses him and I am now writing this (on his behalf and from his perspective) and doing everything. Sometimes the voices in my head seem to be either able to move my body or predict when it happens. For example just now they said “We will n
ow move this hand towards the screen.” and my hand indeed moved towards the screen. I have also attempted suicide, or rather, that spirit or demon tried to kill me - it could duplicate the feeling of moving your limbs and body by intent, and apply it while the body was moving by itself, resulting in me feeling it as if it is me who’s attempting a suicide, and for no apparent reason. Sometimes my head makes strange movements (like shaking, nodding, grinning weirdly, opening and closing the mouth repeatedly, showing tongue, or making weird faces) or my mouth speaks, by itself. It is not only limited to my face - a few times I have waved around with my hands unwillingly or started jumping up and down as I walk - also done by the body itself. I have never acted like this before, nor do I think I have invented myself some of the strange movements which happen repeatedly, so I am assuming it may be paranormal in origin. My doctor’s opinion is that it’s just a feeling that my body is moving by itself and it
s actually me doing everything, but there is no way I would verbally threaten myself (literally, my mouth has told me “I will kill you.”) or attempt to kill myself for no apparent reason at all. Also, those mysterious head’s movements are not random either, they are usually a response to something. Usually when I hear something related to death, a double head shake will ensue. A taboo topic: a half head shake from left to right. When it lies to someone or makes a mistake it will hum (with my vocal cords). If I get a death threat as a fake thought or concept in my head then it will nod. If it finds something funny it will nod several times with my tongue showing out and eyelids blinking. This is not me, I would not act like this. There have been instances where it has started messing around with my entire body in the middle of night. I have posted videos of it happening here: I have voices in my head (most of the time I feel them rather than hear them). They comment on the things I do, or I see happeni
ng around me, or what is happening inside me most of the time. I get threatened every day that I’m going to be tortured for the eternity after I die, and that I should try to escape from this thing somehow (although they also tell me they will try to stop me from escaping it). They also often threaten that the spirit that possesses me is going to kill me. It has already tried to kill me while I was in the hospital, and also one time before I was in the hospital. The voices appear to be fairly intelligent occasionally. One time I hadn’t been sleeping for days and then the voices told “Today you’re going to sleep” and indeed I slept that day. At another time the voices could tell in advance what is going to happen in my dream. Recently the content of my dreams has been entirely about the strange experiences I’ve been having, and I’ve had those voices in some dreams as well. The voices call them “fake dreams” and claim that the program that controls the voices produces those dreams. Other topic
s from both the voices and fake thoughts are how they’ve ruined my life and reminding what I could have done without this condition, and how I’m guilty of the various things it has dug up from my memory that I’ve done wrong in my life. The last one is also the reason why they’re saying I’m going to be tortured after death - they claim that I’ve done those things because my soul is ill, and everlasting torture is an effective way to control me and prevents me from reincarnating in the highly advanced ET society this “spirit”/“demon” was engineered in (supposedly they’ve learned to tap into and program the space where souls exist, and send targeted attacks down that plane as “spirits”/“demons”, causing such “schizophrenia” in targets). There was a period during which I was subject to what I’d call intelligent torture. I felt a really bad feeling, which is like pain and restlessness combined. It was intelligent because it would only ease up during walking, eating, sleeping, ta
lking to the doctor or being in the line to get my medications, and so I spent most of the days in the hospital walking in the corridor all day long. I wouldn’t wish that torture upon anyone, and the voices keep telling me I’m going to be tortured forever, more than I’ve ever been tortured before, after I die. Those voices simply call it torture (in plural, in my language) and they told I was to be tortured unless I’m walking, or on some important business. I don’t know what was the purpose of having me walking all the time. While I’m not being tortured to the extent I was before (it was worse than pain), it can still inflict aches in my head, sometimes quite strong like a toothache, and there are pretty much all the time (they disappear when doing certain things) some unpleasant feelings I feel in my head or body. The voices have told the purpose of this is to calibrate my soul to reincarnate in a place where I’m going to be tortured. I no longer have any emotions. For example I used to play co
mputer games and watch films and Youtube videos before but I no longer get any enjoyment from it. I no longer have any thoughts. My mind is completely empty most of the time. Sometimes I have ideas, thoughts or concepts which are foreign to me - I seem to understand them, but I also feel they are not mine. My own thoughts are completely gone, or hidden from my consciousness. I completely lack the will to do anything, nothing interests me any more, so I spend most of the day in the bed. The medications I’ve been taking haven’t had any noticeable effects. Someone suggested praying to God, but the voices say it won’t count, because it’s the spirit that is praying, not me. Also, it has the ability to block me from understanding the text that I am reading and also block out the meaning of the words that come out of my (or someone else’s) mouth: I can normally understand everything, but when it comes to the Lord’s prayer or something similar then I can no longer understand what is written or what comes 
out of my mouth."
174394061,I’ve been taking it for about 3 to 4 weeks now and yesterday I noticed I began having positive symptoms like racing thoughts and uncontrollable thoughts and out bursts after taking it. I took it again today and it seems to happen on Q. For some reason it seems that even though it’s improving my concentration and focus it’s causing me to have symptoms nw even though it wasn’t doing it before. I’m gonna stop taking it. But yesterday is the day I began taking it with valerian root. So that must be no conicidence. As it wasn’t doing this until I started taking valerian root. I guess they may be interacting or something. Either way I’ll stop the amyloban and lions mane mushroom while taking valarien root. One of the things I read about valerian root was that it made medicine processed by the liver break down slower and stay in the liver longer. Maybe that has something to do with it I don’t know. This is just a post from my personal experience. Just my 2 cents really.

174394057,"I mean this as an alternative to suicide for those who are NOT about to kill themselves due to irrational suicidal ideation, or having suicidal thoughts for no apparent reason, are about to kill themselves due to an unbearable condition or feelings, do not find enough or any relief from antipsychotics or other medications, would not admit themselves to psych. hospitalisation, because that would only mean they’d have to bear unbearable feelings with no way out of it (difficult to commit suicide while you’re locked away in a psych ward), have hope or chance for their condition to improve with time. This might save some lives of people who are about to attempt a rational suicide, such as in severe cases of schizophrenic or depressive episodes. I don’t know if this already is in the medical practice somewhere. Apparently this would be quite expensive - the daily cost of keeping someone in the ICU (intensive care unit) can be thousands of $ or €, depending on where you live. Also related:"

176201678,She showed up all strung out claiming that she’s been in the hospital for a week. She said she stabbed herself in the neck because she can’t see her kids. She had no wound. Later she said she overdosed on her Prazosin to try to kill herself and she was going to do it again if I didn’t help her see the kids right now. She was hysterical. I told her she was in no shape to see her kids and that she needed to clean up and pull herself together before she was around those babies. She went off on me denying the drug use. She repeatedly threatened to kill herself if I didn’t do something to help her so I called 911 to get an officer over here to help. She screamed “big mistake” and slammed the door so hard she broke it and went speeding off in her car. The police are looking for her to make sure she’s safe. I’ve done all I can do in my opinion. Letting her yell at me and tell me what a bad mother I am doesn’t do either on of us any good and her problems are over my head at this point.

176201686,"i would consult that with my phd. APs have to be sneaked out, and if you relapse, have to be taken again, perhaps for live. You have to make sure to reduce the dosis slowly, if dropped too fast, this will always lead into a psychosis caused by the drop time being too fast. Although getting of meds would be my dream to, i tend to live 1-2 additional years with my APs until i have planned that thorougly. What came into my mind, certainly by my friends, too, was: Isolate other stress factors, i.e. do not take off your meds and for e.g. start a diet (stress) in parallel Become stable prior to reducing your medication, e.g. start exercises and introduce a healthy diet step by step Educate yourself about your warning signals which tell you a psychosis may come again If possible, let yourself be supported by somebody in your surroundings (e.g. family, friends, therapist, phd) who may detect you are going to be psychotic even before you do so There has been the first soteria in california, but i think this 
has been closed due to too less money, the concept is to support people through a psychosis or any other mental problems without medication, perhaps you can locate one next to you supporting you going off APs? formulate a plan b if something goes wrong, whom to inform, who can support you, what to do etc. At least that is in short my concept for reducing APs by adding supplements, but i’m just informing myself what works out for me and what not… Best wishes and become / stay healthy StableOne"

176201705,Has anyone ever been misdiagnosed on here? My doctor with grey hair who looks like my grandfather gave me cholesterol medication and I feel like the lights came on like I’m also on anxiety meds too so it could be a combination of both. I showed him my eyes were popping out of my sockets and I’m wondering if my hallucinations were from a stroke. Any thoughts? Any weird misdiagnoses?
176201706,"I’ve heard 12 steps (From AA) are useful to many people, but that’s not what I’m talking about. This is my plan for recovery and I’m saying it in writing for accountability. Step one. Take meds consistently. I’ve already 95% conquered this. Just occasionally forget to take my night med. this was a real problem in the past so I’m proud of myself for taking my meds like clockwork. Step two. Adhere to a routine. This is where I’m at now. So far so good. I get derailed usually by anxiety or by ranting about the voices. My parents and I agree we are going to talk about pleasant things instead whenever the voices come up. Change the subject. We will see how that goes. So I don’t have waste time ranting. Step three. Cognitive behavior therapy so I don’t get derailed by my emotions, which can be quite strong. A nasty therapist that I hated recommend a book called Mind Over Mood to me. I dumped the therapist but kept the book. It is a great book for exercising your mind, to deal with and a
meliorate your emotions. The problem is it only works if you work it. I’m so chaotic that I haven’t made CBT an integral part of my life and thinking yet. But I believe it can work it I do. That’ll be my next step. Step four. Care less about what people think of me. If I’m less sensitive the voices won’t have so much power over me. I have no idea how to achieve this. Do you? Step five. Make small, meaningful goals for myself. Learning a new piece at piano. Learning some Spanish on Duolingo. Increasing my fitness. These things should flow naturally if I’m able to stick to my routine long term. Long term adherence is the key. I don’t know how to achieve that either. Maybe some sort of big reward at the end of the month? I don’t know. Step six. My place in society. I think I want to work in some social good organization. Perhaps politics, perhaps United Way. Something where I feel like I’m doing some good on this planet. This is way down the road. After I get stable with previous steps. I hope 
these ideas help someone else. My friend _AT_MENTION_, what do you think?"

176201723,"I remember a realm I call elysium, It was my home once. A small cabin on the north shore of an endless body of water, snow capped mountains to the north and east of me, radiating a soft light, a road to the west, I always travel west. When I would travel, I’d adventure, these wounderous, fantastical, adventures around planes of existence, entities beyond imagine, not all friendly. I spent what felt like hundreds of years recycling this same loop, cabin, adventure, sometimes death, wake up back in the cabin. The angels and the dead left me alone. I didn’t have voices anymore. I remember it all so clearly, then one day, I wake up here, on this plane, trapped in this body. With its “brain thing”. I really am hating the material plane. Wanna know the messed up part? It’s the longing. This deep constant desire to return to a home, a comfort, a realm. One that’s not only planes of existence, spacetimes away, but a place that might not even be real."

176201731,I know this is a different scenario but here goes… Once I reached 25 my family told me I can’t be “picky” however if I’m going to spend my life with someone I’d rather be “picky “ than spend life with someone I don’t like. I’d rather stay single… So I guess the same applies with friends. I be friends with people I feel a connection with otherwise what’s the point. I’m happy with my own company I had to learn to be.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognition using _NAME_-analysis. A search was performed from inception to 8 January 2019, to identify randomized controlled trials assessing the ability of tDCS to ameliorate cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The effect size, calculated as the standardized mean difference (_PERSON_ g), was obtained with a random effect model. We analyzed mean effects on specific cognitive domains that were evaluated in four or more studie
s. Nine articles were included in the systematic review, which encompassed 270 patients: 133 in the active stimulation group and 137 in the sham stimulation group. _NAME_-analysis demonstrated a significant mean effect of tDCS on working memory (SMD?=?0.49, 95% CI?=?0.16 to 0.83), while non-significant results were produced for other domains. These findings were supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the results would not change in a meaningful way after the exclusion of each single study, and _NAME_-regression analyses verifying the consistent effect irrespective of any moderators. Thus, tDCS may provide a potential option to improve working memory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia. Further trials examining the cognitive benefit of tDCS with medication or other adjunctive treatments are warranted. tl;dr They found that it was effective for working memory over 9 studies, with non-significant effects in other domains."

174394085,"So… (From Wikipedia) Estimates of the heritability of schizophrenia are around 80%. About 85% are unemployed. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. Several times more (20 to 40%) attempt suicide at least once. Use of cigarettes is especially high in those diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers. Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability, with active psychosis ranked as the third-most- disabling condition after tetraplegia and dementia. It occurs 1.4 times more frequently in males. Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset. Schizophrenia has been associated with a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse.

174394095,"Highlights • Circadian pattern of auditory hallucination in schizophrenia patients was examined. • Auditory hallucinations occurred most frequently in the period of 18:00–21:00. • Estimated dopamine D2 receptor blockade by antipsychotics was stable during the day. • The circadian pattern may be considered to devise individualized treatment. Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate possible circadian pattern of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, which could be reflected on the dosing schedule/regimen, i.e. chrono-pharmacology. Patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10) who reported having auditory hallucination, receiving monotherapy with risperidone, olanzapine or paliperidone for at least two weeks were included. The subjects were provided a diary and asked to record the time and duration of auditory hallucinations during the eight time periods (i.e. 00:00–03:00, 03:00–06:00, 06:00–09:00, 09:00–12:00, 12:00–15:00, 15:00–18:00, 18:00–21:00, and 21:00
–24:00). In the diary, times of medication doses and sleep were also recorded. Time and degree of peak and trough dopamine D2 receptor blockade with antipsychotics were estimated from 2 sparsely collected plasma drug concentrations. The prevalence and duration of auditory hallucinations were statistically examined among the eight time periods, respectively. Forty-nine patients participated in this study (mean ± SD age, 50.7 ± 14.8 years; 36 men (73.5%); 34 inpatients (69.4%)). Auditory hallucinations occurred most frequently and lasted for the longest duration in the period of 18:00–21:00 (75.5% (37/49) and 1.37 ± 1.67 h). This happened despite the fact that the difference in D2 receptor occupancy between the peak and trough was less than 2%, indicating a stable drug delivery. Since the dopamine D2 receptor blockade by antipsychotics was stable, the nocturnal circadian pattern found in this study may reflect intrinsic dopaminergic fluctuation or generally quieter environments at night. These circadian 
patterns may be considered to devise individualized treatment approach in the context of “chrono-pharmacology” for patients with schizophrenia. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395619305606?dgcid=rss_sd_all"

174394097,That’s not good either. I take the maximum recommended dose of Geodon. It’s not a 1st generation AP but it’s associated with cardiac risks. I have taken lower doses and was very unstable on them. Were it not for maxing out Geodon and adding Latuda I would have never have been able to go back to school or work.

The other thing is why I always suffer still while on meds, but maybe my illness is special, idk… my doc didnt seem to want to change the zyprexa or add smth more… he even didnt insist like theres something more to do… for 10 years, not any med didnt make me better… I take the zyprexa only to be able to eat and sleep and just be on my feet in the day… why I am in pain still or not happy?

They cant be in complete stress, eat junk, sleep less, and try to solve everything just by having amyloban! (example, they know they get stressed and anxiety by having tea. They cant expect to keep having it and throw in Amyloban to solve it. Stressors have to be eliminated to heal) Amyloban + Diet change + B Vitamins has worked well so far.

176201929,"So more of anxieties than actual hallucinations? Definitely something to call your doctor about, but in the meantime Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I

Like touch base. Say hi, and let the conversation unwind unexpectedly and naturally. There’s a saying, “80% of success is simply showing up.” But that’s only meaningful in a person-to-person setting. Being face-to-face is constant communication, even during silence. You don’t get that on a forum. But just being around people is an expression of friendship. And sometimes that’s enough."

176201972,"Nicotine gum or patch and the vape are just a joke compared to smoking a tobacco cigarette. The positives will decrease and when you got addicted after a month you wanne have the real deal. If you get addicted then try vaping high nicotine. You will get a good feeling for couple of months with decreasing effect in the following year. Nicotine does helps me a lot. Without it I’m totally unmotivated. It’s the only thing I’m willing to do, even if I have to throw up sometimes smoking my first cigarette in the morning. The next thing after throwing up is lighting up a cigarette. If you ever get addicted you will start smoking tobacco when you don’t have nicotine replacement. It’s just too easy to get to the gas station buy cigarettes and a lighter. And if you don’t know, you always smoke as much as your body can handle. People who just smoke ten cigarettes a day, are not more disciplined, you really always smoke to the fullest. Those few cigarettes they smoke are because of their body, it j
ust can’t handle more. Another reason to smoke less is being occupied with a task like work or hobby you care about. Remember nothing else will make you smoke less."

176201976,_PERSON_’s school of thought talks about every child developing the Oedipus complex. The child falls in love (sexually speaking) with the parent of the opposite sex and gets jealous of the other parent. The child eventually learns to admire the same sex parent. This happens at the subconscious level between ages 3 and 6. In rare cases the Oedipus complex is not resolved as the child grows up and can lead to mental disorders later in life. But the evidence supporting this theory is far from conclusive. However during my years of illness I learned to respect my parents’ life choices and I made peace with the fact that I am different from what they expected me to be. This mindset has helped me recover.

It could be that other drugs have worn off and are out of my system, but I haven’t taken any other antidepressants in 2 years. The cannabis addiction was controlling my life and bank balance. It’s been 2 full days of no cannabis or hemp or cbd. Could broccoli sprouts do this, and is anyone in a similar situation?"

176202056,Psychosis is easily the hardest these days. Followed by anxiety second.
176202057,A lot depends on your dose. When I was on 40 mg a day it was horrible. I took the shot as a maintenance drug for a few years. Those were not happy years.
176202058,I don’t think that’s sz. But it could be mania. Have you ever tried dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)? It helps to learn to think rationally and control emotions. My best friend did that for a year and it helped her a lot.

176202061,Yes this happened with one of my ex…he was cheating on me and carried people to the house and I kept hearing things confirming how I felt and he called me crazy and told me I ruined everything… when he was actually cheating and bringing people there… this is before I was diagnosed though… I just thought I had really good intuition.

176202066,"I’m sorry, but I agree with the conclusions of others who have posted in this thread: it sounds like psychosis. I can’t trust those articles as you have altered some by adding your own conclusions in little boxes. Why don’t you send links, so we can see the full, un-altered article?"
176202067,Oh. You’re serious. I thought you were making fun of me
176202068,"Med change might or might not fix some of your issues. You might relapse too if the med doesn’t work. Zyprexa didn’t work for me, made me psychotic. Its up to you and your Dr to weight the benefits vs risks of a med change."
176202069,I do not believe seroquel is used as an antidepressant solely. It is a mood stabilizer so it should help prevent your mania. 12.5-15 mg is an extremely small dose and if anything would just make you a bit sleepy maybe. At low doses it is just used for sleep. If you feel it worsens your mania that could be a sign it has a paradoxical effect on you and maybe it’s not a good med for you. Just know seroquel can be very sedating and is known to cause weight gain. I am on depakote and it controls my depression very well. It is a mood stabilizer so it also helps with mania though I dont get mania. I dont get any side effects from it anymore and the initial ones I did get were very mild.

Idk if I will ever feel close to her. Maybe one day when I am recovered if, then things will be different, but I will never forget how she treated me whilst I was unwell. It really hurts. I feel like she wants me either perfect, or not at all. I could be wrong but that’s how I feel. It really upsets me and stresses me. I need to move out to feel better. Nvt, I am totally grateful for the things she has done for me, although, due to her depression it feels like she does it out of duty. Which also hurts. But like I said she tries her best and so do I. I do a lot of ???? that stresses her out too. Oh yea, plus my stress is trigerred because she was in my psychosis in a horrible, exaggerating way. I wonder if I will ever get over that. I hope so."
176202075,In here it’s mid night so me excercising at this is not a good idea for me.
176202076,Start small with achievable goals. Exercise is good. It helps you feel better and adds to motivation. Don’t go overboard. Do what is reasonable and move from there. Rome wasn’t built in a day is the old saying. You need to put down some roots in good living and give yourself some confidence to tackle the other things in life. Next step when your ready would be some sort of social group. That would be my suggestion.
176202077,"That kind of thing varies from individual to individual. I think all the antipsychotics, both typical and atypical, have a strong effect on your libido. Talk to your therapist and see if you can’t find something that hurts you less in that regard."

176202083,"It had been about 2 years since my diagnosis of schizophrenia, I was very determined to make it without medication at that time, and had been ever since I first got my first psychosis in 2018. I was going to this recovery center for mental health that was out in the country, and the plan was to stay there for 6 months, it was close to nature, with very beautiful surroundings. And the center was just by a lake too. I was at the place for 3 months. Episodes of psychosis which I had before had really made my brain slow, but I noticed that being at that place healed my brain. After a couple of months I could think very fast again and formulate sentences very easily. I met some friends there too. Anyway, being at that place was one of the best times I’ve had in life. Unfortunately after being there for some months I got psychotic, started believing I was god (although I wasn’t 100% convinced), and believed I could communicate with people around the world by thought. I was sent to the hospital, and t
hey put me on forced medication. The reason being that I had been to the hospital a lot of times and had a history of not wanting to take medication. I was put on zyprexa, got akathisia that went away after about a month, but soon after I got another side effect - I got very stressed from the meds. A couple of months after being hospitalized and put on medication I was sent (was my choice) to another place. And being at that other place with the stressfull side effect of the meds was pretty horrible. So that was one of the worst times in my life. About 8 months later I started moving into an apartment (where I live now), I learned that omega 3 helped a lot with the stress from the medication (almost removing it completely), and I also learned that I may have to stay on medication. Thanks for reading. And what I learned by typing this is that something has definitely happened to my cognition because I’m much worse in english and formulating sentences than I used to be. I had to constantly look up words (wher
eas I used to be very good in english)"
176202084,"Like what, cutting down trees??"
176202085,i wouldnever go to see a psychiatrist
176202086,"Darn good point my friend, darn good point. Sometimes it pops up in a family without it. Maybe after it pops up, from that point on it’s carried in the genes? I’m not sure. But like I said it’s a good point and I’m surprised I never thought of it."
176202087,I dont have concentration and motivation

176202090,I’m on a different continent but I went back to work and over here you could put your benefits on hiatus for the max of two years.

I practiced my t’ai ji, read my five “element”/“phase” theory book finishing the first part of the book (as I said in the previous post, the book is split into two parts) and analysed in writing a disease of the heart from my book on purification of the heart. This is certainly enough for today. There are of course many other things I would like to be doing, at least when and if I feel comfortable doing them. Having finished the first part of the book on the five “elements”/“phases”, and having become a bit uncomfortable trying to absorb and process the amount of information in it, I am wondering what to apply my reading to next. There are a couple of completely different subjects which I have books on which I’d like to make time to read, physics and economics. On the other hand, I have a book that goes more slowly through the five “elements”/“phases” describing them in couples, in terms of the five zhang (organs) and five wu shen (s
pirits). I have already read the section on the first couple, the lung and the liver and the “hun” spirit and the “po” spirit. I could move on to reading the next couple, really one in this case as five doesn’t divide by four, the heart and the “jing shen” spirit. So I haven’t decided what I’m going to read tomorrow, will make the decision on the day I guess. Thank you."

176202187,"Hi All, I have a hypothesis. Something that I’ve noticed that happens when I have an episode is that it is like people distrust me and are testing me to see what I will do (perhaps subconsciously), and this exacerbates my paranoia (or really kicks it off actually). I’ve also noticed that when I have an episode, animals pee on my clothes (a possible symptom of distrust?) Also, the following article indicates that oxytocin eases the symptoms of schizophrenia: [New Scientist Article - Google it; cannot post link] Oxytocin is a pheromone that increases trust between two people. And this article talks of another chemical (perhaps a pheromone) called MHA that is present in higher levels in people with schizophrenia: [Google "" CHEMICAL IN SWEAT AND INABILITY TO SMELL IT MAY BE SCHIZOPHRENIA MARKER"" One hypothesis is that this (or another pheromone being exuded) is like anti-oxytocin, and creates distrust, hence the testing. Does anyone else feel like people are testing them when they’re having an 
episode?"

176202199,"So it’s been a little while again since I posted. I guess I’m not addicted to the forum anymore because of 1) having been in hospital for a month and 2) having recovered. My antidepressant meds they prescribed for my anxiety have started to work. My anxiety levels have been reduced a lot - I still worry about things but the physical effects of anxiety have been blocked. So I’d worry but I wouldn’t have a racing fluttering heart or sore hand or a pit in my stomach. It’s wonderful! The pdocs at the hospital said to me they couldn’t diagnose me yet at the time I left. If I had stayed longer they could have but I decided to leave after just a week and a half in therapy ward (instead of 4-5 weeks) because I was in general hospital for nearly a week and the psych hospital acute ward for two weeks as well and after all that I was tired of hospital and worried about my husband coping all alone. My mother in law passed away the day I came out of hospital (22 Jan). She had covid and another infec
tion that caused her kidneys to fail. My father in law had covid too but he luckily survived and is now better. It was sad about my mother in law but I also feel so much relief. I really didn’t like her and now my delusions of her poisoning me is gone which is a blessing! Back to the diagnosis - on the referral letter/prescription the hospital gave me (which I only picked up yesterday along with my stuff I left at my sister) the “working diagnosis” which was main one they treated was anxiety disorder and secondary was personality disorder (probably borderline but they didn’t specify). I don’t know about the sza - if I still have it or not. I did tell them about the voices and Alien and _NAME_ but they didn’t say if I have sza or sz or whatever. It’s very frustrating but when I follow up I will ask. Otherwise why am I taking amisulpride then? And why do I get psychosis again if I stop it? The pdocs told me I am a “challenge” to them to diagnose. I don’t see why - I just have more than one i
llness. I definitely have anxiety disorder and borderline but surely I have sza as well. When I’m ill that’s my symptoms as well. Anyway I’ll have to discuss that with my new pdoc. And that’s about it guys… apart from dealing with severe dust mite allergy. I’m itching all over my skin and my nose and throat and eyes. I realised what caused my blocked nose over the years - not dairy or gluten or polyps - but dust mite allergy. In the dust free environment of the hospital, my nose was normal and open. When I came home to dusty carpets I had to vacuum them but still the dust is affecting me. Maybe I will get some antihistamines…"

174394193,"I have several needs with my schizophrenia and most of them are met. But I have been lacking “filler activity.” That is having something to occupy my time for stretches of time, like a few hours. I feel lost and depressed often because I cannot fill my time. This need could be met by reading for a few hours, watching something good on TV, going out and stretching my time with a friend, a routine activity like working out, or perhaps taking an interest in improving my apartment. I cannot keep busy all day long every day. This may be just another way of saying I need motivation. I see now that this another way of understanding the apathy of schizophrenia.

176202229,I think you should let that episode go. I mean even if it were true you shouldn’t beat yourself up about it. It’s history. Try not to dwell on things that annoy you. I guess your husband involves your family and keeps them in the loop is because he cares about you. I agree that it might be difficult when people we know like family and friends get insight into things that are hard for us to deal with and we don’t want anyone to know. But it’s not to ridicule us. They only want to be informed so they can be ready to help if something should happen i guess. Hope things work out for you.

174394200,"Yeah you’re spot on there. People that have fictitious disorder or something know without a doubt they are faking. I’m confused about it and have no real evidence to support the thought. And unless modern psychiatric treatment is to play along with fakers, then I wouldn’t be on three AP’s, including one of which being an injection that if i dont show up for will be taken to the hospital by a police officer. Even thinking that ethics (or lack if ethics) like that are a possibility is paranoid ideation. Idk, schizophrenia knows how to never let you feel calm when it wants that for you. Get over one delusion, heres the replacement. On and on it goes, i best buckle in."
176202233,People notice. They’re just too polite to say anything. Probably some rotten people would use it against you if push came to shove. I guess it would matter if you’re on a bus or in a busy restaurant or other tight quarters. If people are treating you weird and you are not getting along with certain people it might be part of the problem.
176202234,"Who are you referring to, _AT_MENTION_ ?"
176202235,No ones trying to force you to do anything. It’s all in your head. The term ‘gaslight’ was invented by paranoid individuals who had nothing better to do than to blame the source of their delusions on other people.
174394192,"Frontiers Modulation of Stem Cells as Therapeutics for Severe Mental Disorders and... Severe mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder affect 2-4% of the world population. Current medications and diagnostic methods for mental illnesses are not satisfying. In animal studies, stem cell therapy is promising for... Some very interesting bits in this paper. It may be time to combine stem cell mechanisms and stem cell transplant with recent advances in MRI diagnosis and positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging and progress in computational neuroscience, potentially targeting brain pathology to cognitive impairments. Transplantation of interneurons may facilitate host preceding neurons that can excite, inhibit, or stop the action of other neurons. Combined with an artificial activation on transplanted cells and transplant area, the connection between transplanted neurons and host neurons of high plasticity via synaptic formation may improve neuro-transmission, maintain balances b
etween these cells and between excitatory and inhibitory signals, and help the individual function normally (i.e., cognition, learning and memory, etc.). Intranasal administration has been considered as an efficient and non-invasive medication route to the brain or even for systemic administration to the CNS (59). The cells delivered within the nasal cavity have demonstrated the ability to migrate towards different brain regions, including the brainstem regions, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and striatum, and even to the spinal cord (60). Moreover, the intranasal delivery of cells to targeted regions is less likely to generate ectopic tissue compared to systematic injections. Intranasal delivery of stem cells has been demonstrated to increase retention and improve neurological/psychiatric outcomes. It is expected to facilitate cell homing toward the CNS and to avoid some potential side effects caused by other methods such as intravascular administration. Since there are intranasally deliver
ed peptides, small molecules, viruses, plasmid, and bacterial phages that demonstrate successive entry into the brain, we also expect treatment via the intranasal delivery of cells to the CNS to be adopted for translation to the clinic. Promotion of oligodendrogenesis and myelination can lead to functional benefits and regeneration to combat abnormal neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration of SMI. Modulation of stem cells and physiological Ca2±dependent/activated proteins will be tested in future pre-clinical models and translational studies. Wnt signaling may be critical regulators of these mechanisms in psychiatry and stem cell transplantation therapy for regeneration and repair. Intranasal delivery of hypoxic preconditioned stem cells may be the most appropriate method for psychotic disorders. Neuroimaging is useful in the pathophysiological study of SMI and the evaluation for treatments based on changes in neural activities and WM integrity. Higher-resolution precise imaging may further allow the developm
ent of stem cell treatment targeting specific brain regions. Always nice to read things like “translation to the clinic” ie, eventually using it in people. It looks like this paper is a Chinese/American collaboration, and I notice that they cited _PERSON_, one of the people who was doing stem cell treatment in rodent models of SZ, but that she is not an author on this paper."

Maybe that’s a bad example but it seems the worst art is just in it for money or fame. It probably doesn’t matter which genre of art. That’s across the board.

174394223,i took zyprexa from 16 to 21 years old and when i wanted to change from zyprexa to a new med because it was making me feel like a zombie and sleeping all the time they gave me saphris to try which is a wafer that dissolved under neath my tongue which i thought was strange since i had never seen that before. i ended up going on abilify for a few years before getting on the invega

174394222,"What you should ask yourself, is, what is the desire you were trying to fulfill by wanting to be accepted as a schizophrenic. Then, structure your interactions to lead up to the conclusion being the reveal. Gay people, atheists, etc. go through this crap all the time, its not just us. Outing yourself to your friends or family isn’t a new concept we discovered. So figure out what you wanted from that person and see if you can’t get it elsewhere. Random _NAME_ blow might not care that you’re gay, or he might be highly religious, that says a world about them and not a whole lot about you. You’re not any different after having been blown off by this dude other then you found out he had some hangups about mental health and the people who struggle with it. You don’t need validation from others to be happy with yourself. Even if you do want validation. Some people can’t give that to you because of where they’re at and what they’ve grown up learning. Maybe it still matters to him or maybe i
t doesn’t. I just hope you learned from it."
176202279,"I would strongly recommend giving CBT a go sometime. I think you’re harbouring a lot of negative thoughts about yourself and the world around you, and you would be able to enjoy life a lot more if you could learn to challenge them. CBT is all about challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. Just a quick quote from something that is relevant ""_NAME_ (_PERSON_, J.S, 2005 & 2011) proposes there are three main categories of negative core beliefs about the self: -helplessness, -unlovability, and -worthlessness. The beliefs that fall into the helplessness category are related to personal incompetence, vulnerability, and inferiority. Unlovability-related core beliefs include the fear that we are not likable and incapable of intimacy, while worthlessness-themed core beliefs include the belief that we are insignificant and a burden to others. If we have negative views of others, we may think of them as untrustworthy, as wishing to hurt us, or as demeaning, uncaring, or manipulative. All of these beliefs 
may make us very anxious to avoid rejection and overly keen to seek validation from others. (_PERSON_ 2018) If our core beliefs are positive and helpful, we need to take no further action. If they are not, we must seek to transform them, for limiting core beliefs are the root causes of low self-esteem. They shape how we treat ourselves, others, and even how others may treat us. They set the rules by which we live and the tone of our self-talk."""

Something needs to change for me because I’m extremely lonely and I don’t even see how anyone can make friends if they aren’t on recreational drugs together. It’s so hard to make friends in this society

She asked me to pay half the house rent and live with her but I don’t have money so we left each other. I don’t have disability money because I live with my parents and have no expenses. I also left her for a couple of months when I was in mental hospital without telling her I have sz. The lesson that I learned in this is that my parents love me more than any girlfriend."

176202293,"I spend most of my time on my PC. Reading forums, watching videos, playing games etc. Recently I noticed that vision in my left eye is really blurry and I obviously need to get glasses. In the mean time, what should I do to pass the time? While I can read the screen I feel like I’m straining my eyes by doing so. I was already really depressed but this makes me feel quite devastated. I struggled to enjoy myself before this, and now I just don’t know what to do. I spent the last two days or so in bed. When I get up I’m instantly reminded of this sight issue and I go back to bed. I’m also worried I won’t get an appointment until 2021. My Mum has said she will book an appointment with a family friend today. But today she didn’t and now says she will do it on Wednesday which is only a week before things start to close down for Christmas. I know I’m old enough to book the appointment myself but its her friend and I need to be driven there. The idea that I might have to wait three weeks to b

176202294,"Hello, thanks. I will have to contact my psychiatrist. I am just afraid because i changed medication multiple times and sometimes it got worse or the side effects were really difficult to deal with. Last time i saw my psychiatrist, he suggested i take some xanax or some other type of anxiolitic medication. I am just afraid to get hooked on it. I am pretty easily addictive and I already struggle with alcohol. But i will try to muster the courage to contact my psychiatrist. Thank you."

Can you elaborate why you believe this? I think i have. I liken it back to _NAME_ k dick 's speech in France in the 70s. I experienced the same thing and even believe I had the letter and it was given to him. Just a part of it. I remember stuff, but i talked all about it before. People don’t like the idea we live in the matrix. I dont know what or who runs it. I guess aliens. I or we don’t really know. I hope its isomorphic, God, or not real. I remember stuff else too. Perhaps its on another earth or planet or even through the big bang. I had a quantum computer and another computer. Im doing recall here. Why would they pick you? I know why they picked me. They try confusing me and let me know only what they want me to know… I remember being in my house. Perhaps with aliens and reptilian shapeshifters…i thought my ste
p dad ran it too, but that part can’t be real. Its part of the illusion and mind control aspect i realize now. I have to believe in Christianity but that doesn’t mean it’s right. They forced me. It gives me a sense of morality and comfort among other things… I dont think we are all the same people at all. Your statement makes me question the value of your delusion."

176202314,I make under $800 a month working part time. I get Medicaid for like $10 a month. It so far covers pretty much everything medically necessary. It covers some dental and vision too. I’m applying for ssdi and have my hearing coming up in April. I’ll be getting like $650 a month last time I checked. But i wont qualify for Medicaid anymore unless I reduce my hours and make less than the cut off for Medicaid all together. _PERSON_ didnt know you had to pay for Medicare and j read theres a 2 year gap between getting benefits and qualifying for Medicare. Js this true and how could I afford that…? My mom said with recertification you need tk be seeing a dr. I would lose my medicine and my doctors.

176202320,"I think its because you’re constantly hearing things you cant control. Most of the time voices are negative and repetitive. Negativity breeds negativity. It’s like when you’re around someone close to you and you start to develop some of their habits or mannerisms. The important thing is to always clarify for yourself and realize that those are not really your thoughts. Just like the voices, they are things you cant control. You are clouded in your mind so it makes it hard to “breathe” or understand everything your brain conjures up or pushes forward."

176202357,"Im working to try and lower my stress levels. I have PTSD I think caused mostly by the impact of my illness on my neurology. I realize I remember in vivid details trauma and episodes, but I dont recall simple things or daily things as easy. My long-term memory is better than short-term, and I want to be in the present moment. My mind is always thinking, its like a defense mechanism. I dont hallucinate as much because I feel like I’m willing away the hallucinations through internal dialogue, thinking constantly, trying to keep things in line, in order. I practice being normal. My life is very structured around being stress free. I really wish I could just will away my illness. But I am realizing I cant, and I need to stop shaming myself for this disease. I need to accept it, and they need to stop changing my labels and denying me the mental health care I need. Because I want to have a normal life, I keep trying and get burnt out. It would be nice if I could stop stressing about the future. So I am 
trying to just stop stressing, let go and accept it. And work on balance. Right now I am considering that I wish I could go inpatient to a psyche ward, but that also would probably be more stressful than being here at home. I need my meds adjusted, I need to stop relapsing, and I dont know what I can do other than try and not think so much, drink coffee but less coffee, and get regular sleep and take my meds but it still feels like not enough. I had a few hallucinations, I think I set myself up for another relapse in mental health."

If I just did that I could get more calls and SSDI too and probably make more money than I am making now. All the other mechanic jobs I have been offered are out of state and I can’t afford to move out of state for what they offer. I talked to an Airline in _USER_ID_ before the holiday but that would be too expensive to move there. I am working on getting qualified to fly drones and may be able to get a job doing that here but they tell me you have to do a lot of traveling.

174394253,It doesn’t sound like you’re on an antipsychotic then ? Also Quetiapine actually made me worse. You need to get on an antipsychotic that works for you. See if you can get an earlier appointment. December is a long way off.

If your parents aren’t helping you or it’s a toxic environment what do those people do? How do they get out? Shouldn’t more safety nets be in place to prevent abuse or trauma? Financial despair Leads to suicide. I’ve been in financial despair for the past four years.

176202391,i blinded all the windows in the house cause the voices were telling me to block the view from the outside. Obviously my mum and dad didn’t like it very much and had a hard time dealing with me making me take it off the windows.

176202398,"I get exhausted easily. I can wear myself out just by thinking about the task at hand. Suddenly going down and coming up the stairs is too much. Where there’s stuff to do and I can get away with it, I’ll sham out and disappear. I’m very talented at shamming out of things. I learned in my previous career that standing around waiting for someone to volunteer you for something is not a good idea. My motto is out of sight, out of mind."

176202402,"Yes, it doesn’t exist."
176202403,the beach is nice …
176202404,"Well, we can split delusions into four categories: those that are a byproduct of hallucinations those that are a byproduct of our emotions those that we are conditioned to believe to be true those that we want to believe to be true Since antipsychotics mainly target hallucinations, then eliminating the hallucination eliminates the type 1 delusion. Type 2 delusions originate in our emotional centers, such as the prefrontal cortex. Destroy the emotional tie, destroy the type 2 delusion. Conditioning is the process of continuous training of a certain belief or belief system. If a person can be conditioned, then they can be deconditioned. Do that, and the type 3 delusion disappears. And finally, we have the type 4 delusion, or the delusion that someone wants to believe. For this sort of delusion, you need to figure out why the person is holding on to their belief system so tightly. How is it helping them? Help the person move on from whatever’s holding them back, and the delusion may shift or lessen 
in intensity, but is unlikely to be completely abandoned. In conclusion, delusions may end in the right hemisphere, but I highly doubt that they begin there."
176202405,"Last night I was manic before I went to bed, as I was falling asleep I felt the psychotic depression like swirling around me…so maybe even 20mgs of Prozac a day isn’t safe for someone with schizophrenia? I am contemplating suicide for no reason today I just feel all the sorrow in the world. So it’s either no joy, no sorrow. I dont know how to have normal emotions. But I don’t know if this is normalizing my emotions or making me unhinged. I feel amazing, but my brain keeps saying slow down now slow down go to sleep. Im scared. I won’t be able to go to rehab if I take prozac, because I will not have the will or motivation to participate."

176202409,Are the sensations squiggly or constant?
174394258,"^^ True but also - PubMed Central (PMC) Functional Hallucinations in Schizophrenia Responding to Adjunctive Sodium... Functional hallucinations are a rare phenomenon, wherein hallucinations are triggered by a stimulus in the same modality, and co-occur with it. Although hallucinations in schizophrenia are normally treated using antipsychotics, not all patients... It would take a pdoc to untangle whether it’s what you’ve mentioned or not."

The only thing that has changed is an increase in Pregabalin. I actually feel much more settled on this med, and I can’t remember the last time a drug had such a profound impact on my anxiety. What’s your mind focusing on? I hope others can have some nice things to think about, as negative thoughts/feelings can be really de-motivating and draining on your life"

176202419,So you still have side effects?
176202420,"Well I gotta tell you I just can’t handle the stress of that store, it’s too big. It freaks me out."
174394260,It doesn’t have the same side effect profile as other ap because it doesn’t bind to dopamine receptors though
176202421,"_AT_MENTION_ , I needed to do an internship to finish an educational program over 20 years ago. I didn’t know where to look so I never got my certificate. I wish someone had told me about the job department."
176202422,I already yelled at a psychiatrist once. I redirected my violence towards my family as they are more forgiving than a stranger. Its a good thing actually but I wish I could stop being violent when off meds.
176202423,They help me function professionally. I wouldn’t have been working these past couple of decades without them. I currently work at a job that has a high cognitive load and it’s acknowledged that I do it better than most.

We had to yell into the mic cuz the guy couldn’t hear what we were saying, and after we repeated ourselves, he proceeded to repeat what we asked him back to us. Its 9 PM, there was literally no customers in the place. What bothers me the most is you’re supposed to have at least 2 of each items on hand at all times to prevent a cluster fck of orders. But you’re right, some employees cant multi task and take forever to complete an order. Essentially, it’s a team effort thing; if one employee is slacking then the whole team is.

174394257,I did have pronounced negatives when on Invega alone. Almost all aps will have that effect. My pdoc added 10mg Abilify which ha s greatly reduced the negatives. You could try that instead of stopping Invega.

I want to get into screen printing, but that’s neither here nor there. To soften the hard water lines, there are two ways. While your painting is still wet, you can “pull out” the pigment in the direction away from the shadow, and use more water until it fades properly to white. After it’s dry (and I mean truly and completely dry), wet your brush, then squeeze the water out until it’s damp. Scrub gently and then blot the area with a tissue. Let it dry again, same repeat until its effectively blended into the next area. That’s called “lifting.” (And I do mean GENTLY. You don’t want to tear the paper.)"

176202454,I’m sorry you aren’t doing too good. Perhaps the best thing to do is call and get a sooner appointment with your pdoc. 3 weeks is along time to wait when you’re feeling like you’re going to self destruct. As far as work goes is there anyway you can take some time off?

176202466,"The topic comes and goes in the US. So I’ll explain sometime that interests me about this topic. The SSDI limit for working is $1,260. If you divide it by the number of hours in a 40 hours a week work month you will work 7.9 hours/week. That means either the boss will find it in his best interest to hire you for 1 full day/week, 2 half days/week or they will have to increase the limit greatly. Or they could go \back to not hiring the disabled due to the bother it would cause them. When you look at this this way how do you feel about it?"
174394265,"Ooh. I totally forgot to further explain. I was going to touch on that subject as well. At the moment I only have a phone so it will be slightly more harder for me to type out a proper response. Also I moved recently and had to wait for the internet heh. Well, to answer your question. Yes, schizophrenia runs on my dad’s side of the family. My uncle has schizophrenia, three of his sons do too. My female cousin’s from my dad’s side have not exhibited schizophrenia thankfully. My dad does not have schizophrenia but he does have manic depression, I think that may now be referred to as bipolar disorder. My dad says as far as he knows he had two aunts (from his mother’s side) that suffered from similar maladies though they were never formally diagnosed as it was during the 50’s and before in Mexico. My mom’s side of the family is much larger. She is one of 14 children compared to my father who only has one brother. In my mom’s side of the family there is only one of about 54 cousins other t
han myself, who has been diagnosed with a mental illness. We’ve never discussed the subject despite my cousin and I being fairly close. Of my cousin’s children, (from my mom’s side) at least two have a mental illness. One has bipolar disorder while the other I’m unsure of. It is safe to say it came from my dad’s side of the family. It wasn’t drugs, it is just a hereditary brain disease unfortunately. My dad was around 40 when I was born. From what I’ve read, that can be a factor. According to one article I believe the chances of schizophrenia to be passed on rise after a certain age, mid thirties maybe? As for the Haldol, I do understand it is often used as an immediate treatment as it is readily available. My unbiased feelings on it are that it may be an outdated treatment compared to some newer medications. Advancements have been made. I hope that helps explain somethings. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask. I can go into more detail and when I have some time to spare I can co
ntinue with personal experiences regarding other meds I mentioned, their side effects, how much they worked (for me), and such. Some did better than others after all. Glad to be of some help in your research and or studies."

This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant.

I dont like how they make me feel. A friend of mine though is content with her meds and has no problems with them. She likes the calm feeling they give her. There are good sides - they often stop extreme experiences and emotions and this can make life more bearable for self and others/loved ones. It can save lives. There are also bad sides - side effects, withdrawals. Which of the above weigths more depends on your specific situation/symptoms/response to meds and cant be answered by us.

Used to compulsively wash my hands again and again (I thought i could catch illnesses that weren’t contagous, like cancer). My parents took me to the Dr. when they saw my hands started cracking from washing so much. Doc said its probably not worth medicating me since there’s a chance I’ll grow out of. My little brain figured out hmmm I shouldn’t do this or I’m going to get in trouble. Ended up coming up with little mental rituals that I internalized and would repeat. I’m in my late 30s and the rituals would come and go throughout my life. I had my first hospitalization for psychosis around 10 years ago, and now the OCD has turned into negative intrusive thought loops and persistent SI for the last 4 years. At times it feels like its impossible to build any self esteem that lasts more than a couple days at a time. I’ve tried doing things like meditation and some CBT stuff, but it doesn’t seem to stick.

The avolition was trying to suck me under but I kept my head above water. Now two days of writing and editing my new book “The Seeker” has begun. It’s a book about signs of God in everyday life. Also want to work on a book about vegan living called “The Barefoot Vegan” I know I will have many more struggles with avolition - as I have sza after all - but hope that I can have more writing sessions in future.

176202614,"The great drawback of the word ‘paranoia’ is that it can sound like something only very obviously disturbed people would ever end up being. We associate the term with types who are sure that the FBI is following and that aliens are planning a descent to earth. And thereby we miss out on ways in which, in a far more subtle but equally destructive manner, we ourselves are in fact prey to a host of paranoid and unfair interpretations of reality that over time drain life of a sizeable share of its joy and promise. Our everyday paranoia can have worked its way into being a constant, imperceptible feature of the way we look at the world. When a boss asks if we might step into their office for a word, it’s clear we are going to be fired. When a partner has been absent for a while, there is no doubt that they are having an affair. When we want to make a move on someone we like, we can tell they will judge us revolting. Equipped with such certainties, we take understandable precautions; we don’t smi
le much, we never initiate, we interpret every silence and ambiguous situation as the end or an insult. It can sometimes feel preferable to be dead. The first step to overcoming our paranoia is to notice that, despite our robust disinterest in UFOs, we may actually be sufferers. We need to notice how often, and with what perverse imaginative energy, we keep interpreting uncertainty in a negative direction - and with what relentlessness we picture everyone and everything as having nefarious or damaging dimensions. We need to spot with what masochism we narrate the story of our lives so that nothing can ever be pure or reliable. We need to step back and identify with what insistence we close off every avenue of hope, every promise of trust - and how quickly and naturally it seems that everyone must hate us and disaster is going to have to descend. As ever, paranoia has a history. It is an assumption about the future based on certain unconsciously held ideas formed in a past one has forgotten, or deftly chosen n
ot to look at. Movingly, the paranoid person is not entirely wrong: some people are mean, some situations do turn out for the worst, some very bad stuff happens… But the subsequent error is twofold. Firstly, the paranoid person locates the issues invariably in the future, they scan what’s ahead rather than turning backwards and locating a particularly traumatic event that will have been responsible for the _NAME_ of their frightened and angst-ridden mind. And secondly, there is an error of generalisation. The paranoid person imagines that everyone is about to be horrible and every hopeful situation is going to turn sour not because this is true, but because it was once true, and their difficulties have not been set into a proper context by a robustly healthy adult mind. In the past of every paranoid person there will, we can say with near certainty, be an experience of appalling let down. Someone who should have been kind wasn’t at all; somewhere that should have been safe turned into a place of horror; 
someone one was waiting for didn’t show up. So traumatic was this, the paranoid person took their experience and imagined it to be applicable across the whole landscape of human experience. And so now, necessarily, every love story must turn bad, every apparently respectable person must be cruel and every good thing has to turn to dust. Paranoia is a negative experience generalised - and then forgotten that it has been so. This gives us clues as to how to leave the paranoid mindset behind. We must work to expand the data upon which our impressions of reality have been founded. We need to learn that the entire world isn’t evil, we’ve just had a very bad, and very selective, introduction to it. There are a few pathological people, but the vast majority are kind and keen to help. There are a few big disasters, but most days are going to end calmly. We need a new voice in our minds that can in a kindly way probe at our sinister assumptions: ‘Are you sure they never wanted to see you again?’ ‘Did they 
really mean to insult you?’ ‘Does it have to be the end of this project?’ Then we need to remember that we are no longer the people we once were when the events which gave rise to our paranoia occurred. At that point, we were small. We had no options. We couldn’t run away, complain - or find a more benevolent environment. Children have no agency, but the adults we’ve grown into resolutely do. We have the choice, and indeed the right, to move away from the minority of settings that can harm us and individuals who seek to bring us down. We don’t have to cling to fear and anxiety because we have the confidence and security to know that we can look after ourselves. Naturally, it doesn’t help anyone over a psychological problem to give it a label so horrible, no one would ever freely want to imagine themselves as a sufferer. So we should learn to see paranoia in mild, universal and respectable terms: as a very common but very unnecessary suspicion that disappointing and persecutory things are about t
o happen, not because they are, but because they once did. We’re paranoid not because someone is actually following us, but because - way back - someone did follow us, and we were too young and too fragile to learn to set negative events into their proper perspective. The opposite of paranoia is, in a sense, love, a trust that we deserve not to suffer, that others will respond appropriately to our vulnerability, that we are not to be natural targets of mockery. We aren’t a bit paranoid because we are mad conspiracy theorists, but for a far more poignant and understandable reason: because we were once extremely scared, very weak and very alone, and now never again need to be so."

174394331,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Consistent Exposure to Psychosocial Stressors and Progressive Intolerance to Stress in Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis. I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, HR _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia bulletin, Mar 2020 02 A body of evidence suggests that exposure to psychosocial stressors and stress sensitivity are involved in psychosis pathogenesis. However, little is known about the temporal course of these domains in those with psychosis-risk syndromes. Further, to date there have been no studies examining associations between psychosocial stressors and impaired stress tolerance, or how these factors might be implicated in symptom progression prior to psychosis onset.A total of 73 clinical high-risk (CHR) participants and 78 healthy controls (HC) completed baseline measures of life-event (LE) exposure and impaired stress tolerance. Additionally, 54 CHR and 57 HC participants returned to complete the same procedures at a 12-month follow-up assessment.Results indicated that when com
pared to HCs, CHR individuals exhibited increased LE exposure and impaired stress tolerance at baseline. Longitudinal analyses compared subgroups of CHR participants who exhibited positive symptoms worsening over the one-year course (CHR-Prog), improved or steady (CHR-Remiss/Persist), and HCs. CHR-Prog individuals showed consistently elevated independent LEs exposure while CHR-Remiss/Persist reported a decline and HCs a steady low level across time. Further, CHR-Prog exhibited increased stress intolerance, while the CHR-Remiss/Persist improved and HCs displayed consistently low levels over time. Analyses examining interrelationships between these domains showed a trend level interaction effect predicting follow-up symptoms.Taken together, results from the present study indicate an important role for exposure to stressors and increasing stress intolerance during psychosis pathogenesis. Additionally, findings indicating decreases in stress exposure may lead to more favorable outcomes provide a promising target 
for novel targeted interventions."

174394333,"I have seen seen some of _PERSON_’s youtube videos on Consciousness and Free Will last year. I believe his thinking is incomplete. I believe _PERSON_ is a strong atheist and neo-Darwinist based on what I know about him. He cannot accept the concept of a real mental reality. Since _PERSON_ has accepted the belief that the physical world is the only reality, any counterpoints to that belief he defines as illusory. Because of his life experience, he claims that free will is an illusion too. From him, all choices made by us are the result of chemical and electrical activity in the physical brain and not a result of a option made by a mental self. He claims responsibility this one video but at the same time claims there is no you that can be responsible. That does not make sense to me. I can agree with the concept of a physical body with a physical brain as responsible for part of our life experience. But if I also agree, with that being the sole element responsible, then there is no other factor cont
rolling my physical and mental activity. Essentially, I didnt make that mistake…my brain did. It seems like he is saying “I didnt choose to do that…my brain did.” However, I believe the truth of both mental and physical realities. Not one side or the other but an interaction of BOTH. I am an awareness that can watch both my mental and physical changes in my life…and then choose how to respond to them. Sometimes, the choices can be really hard…the option left to me in either reality may be: Can I choose to accept this reality that I am facing in the now…or…do I want to keep resisting it? This is especially important to me as a schizophrenic. I can only choose during a conscious reality of Now awareness. In the past 3 years since I started experimenting with my mental methods during the start of psychosis, I have never lost control of my body. Before I implemented these methods, there were many incidents where I was raving or screaming and lost control of my body, I was not conscious. In fact, I 
only knew about my psychotic states after my family told me I was having them. I would have extreme unconscious psychosis multiple times a year. But in the past 3 years, I had it only once. It did not start in a conscious state of psychosis either but happened during sleep. Science likes to solely use the physical world as proof of cause and effect. Essentially: Before the state was that(A). Now it is this(B). What caused this change in reality from A to B? New this© did. This works wonderfully for physical laws of non-conscious objects in our reality. It falls flat on face when trying to explain subjective reality because only the experiencer of the subjective reality knows what it was. We cannot share our true mental state especially with those who have not experienced and, in fact, are not willing to experience it. Science has, in fact, blocked research into non-physical aspects of our reality claiming if it is not based on the physical then it is not real science. Science calls this kind of research pseu
doscience. But to use my earlier example, if C was the connector between states A and B ( A -> C->B, then what was the connector between A and C? Science will have to choose to either explore this subjective connection further or simply choose to ignore it and say there is nothing more to explore. In the end, for me at least, it comes down to this: In this life, we experience numerous states Some we desire more of, some we want less of and some dont matter We choose what to do based on desires at the moment of choice We know what we can do at the moment based on past knowledge and current beliefs But even knowledge is based on belief We define true knowledge as what we believe to be real, truth etc. Just enjoy the changes in your life experience that you want more and accept that there will be ones that you(currently) cant have more of. Open the mind to new concepts and ideas. Share your experiences with the Others in this life experience. The brain is not willing to accept new ideas unless they are already r
ewarding. So instead of trying to distract the brain when it is facing negative states, make an effort to actually experience the negative state and see how YOU change during it. Further experience means further familiarity and helps in accepting ALL states. This can be extremely useful when experiencing depressive states. Your brain is part of you that does not want to explore the negative but a mental part of you can…and by doing so you learn more about yourself that you did not know before. Comfort zones feel good but can get boring after a while. We can enjoy states of love and being more when we also know of states of suffering and nonbeing better. Both love and fear need each other. Each only has meaning with the the existence and knowledge of the other."

176202706,Taking the kids out for supper for doing well at school. So today will not be the day. I guess I can just make that my mantra. “Today is not the day”. I wonder if it’ll work. Well it will til Monday anyway.
176202707,"What is Parkinson, by the way you discribe i have this little issue on Olanzapine, after i take my meds, my hands and feet, like i need to stretch them, its like kind of an itch."
176202708,Side effect wise It messed with my blood sugar so I have to take metformin to counteract that. Anxiety is the biggest problem I have with it. I take supplements to keep that manageable.
176202709,"Awww…love ya right back, Chordy!"
176202710,How are your voices?
176202711,"Im not in any danger , I have reason enough to fight through , and yes these its very hard for me to tell right now what is delusional and what isn’t, having people understanding what that is like is warming to my soul right now . Things have been tough and sometimes I forget to be kind to myself , there are such wonderful people , full of love and kindness just waiting for a chance , my path somehow got so messy , I blame no one but myself and the fact I care so much what others think of me it consumes me and I become someone else Im trying to take amisulpride and im organising a meeting with my doctor Thank u so much for replying"
176202712,"Hey rox Got any crochet projects going recently? I’ve switched from chat support to phone support, so when I’m not pulling customer files I have my hands free to knit. Let’s just say I could do socks in my sleep now."
174394343,"Ah okay! I couldnt precisely remember, just the 50%. I understand!"
176202713,What do you mean by respecting fear?
176202714,Yummm! They look so good
176202715,You might have more than u think
176202716,"No, no, I meant there are normal folk who think they are sane and the world has a problem."
176202717,"Haldol ? It’s really strong. Only problem is there are lots of side effects Usually when pdocs prescribe a atypical and that’s not effective enough, they’ll give you a typical. Fluphenazine was really good too and perphenazine as well. Just stay away from thorazine"
174394334,Do you take a mood stabilizer or antideppresant?
176202718,Be strong Greenmind. Sending some positive energy !!
176202719,Here’s what’s going to happen if you go off your invega. You might be fine for a few days or even a couple weeks. Then you voices will come back and when you try to go back on the invega it will take a long time for them to go away. If you stay off meds too long and go really psychotic then you can end up worse off for a much longer period of time. If you have this delusion it may not even go away with your experiment. Logic would tell you that the meds have silenced your voices at this point… yet you still believe. My 2 cents
176202720,I think so. My hallucinations tell me so.
176202721,Yes we broke records this summer. It was brutal. I’m welcoming the temps in the 90s with open arms!
176202722,I walk/run with the dog once every day or once every other day. Thats about it.
176202723,"I wasn’t arguing against a lot of the symptoms are the same though was I? I was arguing there are big differences in things like their personalities. If you got a bunch of people with aspergers and put them in a room and you got a room full of people recovered and on medication with sz, you would be able to tell the difference. Your not arguing against my point that there are differences. People with autism have things like meltdowns, and have really focused interests on things like a certain part of culture. Arguing for saying they have the same problems is like saying everyone with sz has autism."
176202724,"I mean they learned to stay out of my way. Then I wonder why I get lonely. Sheeesh. Then for awhile, I was a pushover. That must have been guilt. I’ve got to settle down and give a little care to myself. Care that isn’t narcissism."
176202725,"yea same… but i accepted that it is like that… can’t fight it anyways huh =/ But it makes me feel dumb and slow too, so i relate to you…"
176202726,Your haughty comment is also part of this thread.
176202727,"No, I don’t think you sound too paranoid. You’ve reminded me that I need to put tape on my new computer, too, so I really appreciate this thread."
176202728,"I agree saturated fats are not bad, that’s been debunked. There are even documentaries about it. Medicine and science are evolving, but there’s always a lot of inertia."
176202729,I’m very apathetic. I wish I could be more interested in life. I also don’t know how to overcome it.
176202730,"_AT_MENTION_ , the cause of the conversion disorder is mental, nope? In my case it is… I think its because of too much stress… Yours got better with what meds, if you don’t mind to share? Did you have to put your own efforts too? Take care"
176202731,Actually it looked something like this.
176202732,Yep. I have a crazy weird sense of humor.
176202733,Nope i was quiet while i was being injected with whatever and the voices were saying the doctors and nurses were experimenting on me the guy who was on the same room as me though got tied to his bed because he said the people there were trying to kill him.
176202734,"I remember being lost in delusion and it was weird BC everything about it seemed real yet I knew deep down it was wrong, maybe that’s what helped pull me out of it, the underlying feeling that things were not as they seemed which incidentally probably got me into the delusion in the first place, I guess I got to a point where I was like ’ this ain’t right’ but meds helped with that It’s been years since having delusions now it’s hard to think I ever had them but I did and I can see them for what they are"
176202735,Mostly since 2005. I did see someone around 1997-98. Then hospitalized around 2000 and 2002.
176202736,"Congratulations on 9 months, that’s huge!! Should be proud. I relate x it’s a hard time getting back to yourself sober and remembering who you are and how to enjoy life again, but it’s worth it 100%"
176202737,Was there an earthquake going on?
176202738,It may be because invega isn’t meant to be every 3 weeks. It’s meant to be a month. Plus I’m on the max dose and will going every three weeks that’s how bad my delusions get. Hope everything goes well with your doc.
176202739,_PERSON_ has deep texts
176202740,And I seriously have no memory of the last time I took my pain medicine so I don’t know when I can take more. I hate that ????.
176202741,"I think with meds you can limit symptoms a lot. There will still be mood swings, maybe delusions, maybe hallucinations. But you can learn to manage your disease. You can work and seem fine. You take meds still but you can do alright. Well that’s what I’m doing lately. I feel great. I still have dark spots. Right now I must be in a bright spot because it seems like it’s always been good or it always will at least. But then there’s days when I’m down like last week. There’s days I consume with delusions. But hey life is such. I’m happy I’m alive. We got each other too!!"
176202742,It took me 9 years.
176202743,I’m not understanding what you mean
176202744,Will you go to the hospital if you feel you have to?
176202745,"What about my paranoid sensations? I should ignore? Some people talk me about the devil lately lol… Yeah, it was hard for me to see how my friends were helped by the meds in months almost, they fight for happiness, while me I am not sure, that I’ll be able even to walk sometimes… My bf wants to see me free now, happy etc, but I get paranoid around this pressure Does the recovery is sometimes so slow?? Should I accord to myself this little bit of time no matter, that everyone around me wants something else from me? Yeah, I suffered…I had a terrorist in my family tbh… I didn’t even learn to talk…"
176202746,"Yes, of course it’s boring. Dont you have any art sessions?"
176202747,"I can take diazepam pretty much whenever I want, and I have enough to take as much as I want. Problem is when I need to take it, my head is so far gone it’s the last thing that comes to mind as a solution The crisis line lady told me to take some, and in the space of 5mins I had forgotten. Only when she said again to take it I said I forgot and physically put a 5mg tablet in my hand so I’d take it. How do you all remember to take PRN? I am really struggling with this, as apparently it helps, but I never seem to think about it"
176202748,I took Latuda early once and it was terrible. I think it made me panicky.
176202749,"I Googled it and while feminine behavior seems to be related to a few PDs, masculine behavior in men is associated with other PDs, and I’m pretty sure the effect sizes are completely insignificant. The only one of your statements in that post that I think is actually something significant enough that professionals bother to look for it is extravagant clothing and make-up, and that’s related primarily to bipolar disorder, not psychosis."
176202750,Try making smoked salt. It’s easy and adds smoked flavor to other foods.
176202751,You could talk to one of the elders or pastors and see what he they have to say. They might help you with something more chill to do.
174394352,I’m not sure what you’re asking. Aren’t all thoughts inside thoughts?
176202752,now im worried its covid and im gonna die… ??????? health anxiety
176202753,I talk about it when I feel like it. It’s hard to keep secret because I talk about time travel lol. I don’t care what people think. I only have 6 facebook friends and they are my close family. Anyone that is bothered about me talking about it or that I have it can get lost!
176202754,I’m not sure. Maybe it’s akithisia that makes you on edge and comes out as anxiety. I have high anxiety from APs until I take my Cogentin and then it goes away
176202755,Can you expand on what you mean by rudely learnt?
176202756,"I hope u don’t do it, you’re a nice person. And life can get better"
176202757,I don’t like what I see in my reflection either _AT_MENTION_ I look old and tired. I know what you mean.
176202758,"Also if you’re serious and not just looking for sex, I would mention if you are working or not in dating apps profile. I had many girls asking me if I am working or studying. Also some asked where did I go for vacation, what I like the most in life etc I had most matches on _PERSON_. Some girls are scary, there was a girl in sexy latex clothing holding a big cross. It traumatized me."
176202759,"The answer is “no”, they couldn’t. …and I hate to be the bearer of bad news but thinking other people are demons sounds an awful lot like psychosis to me."
176202760,"Usually, if you have no plans to carry out your suicidal or homicidal ideations, they don’t hospitalize you."
176202761,_PERSON_ wasn’t the disorder in question…
176202762,That’s good you have gotten more social!
176202763,I usually sleep from 11 pm to 11 am
174394348,I only had the tought that I had superpower like controling people to do things they didn’t want to do. Nothing else. No voices or hallucinations. Now that I’ve been under medication I feel like I’m normal again but I lost a lot comunication skills. I can’t express myself like I used to. I can’t express my thoughts like I used to and I have a lot of trouble understanding other people too. Should I continue with the medication that I feel is controling me ? I feel like I could be able to live thinking I had a super power.
174394365,I met my girlfriend at a support group. You might want to try a support group.
176202764,Tobacco? No I don’t smoke anything. But I have issues with eating that they were trying to ‘help’ me with.
176202765,"Um, pedophilia is a tiny minority thing. How is an underdeveloped stick figure supposed to be more attractive that a fully developed woman with curves and such?"
176202766,It’s not soccer it’s football and I love it and played it when I was young but now I watch it once in a while
174394355,Yeah of course. I am on a pension so don’t work. I do a couple of half days volunteering to get out of the house. I have the same problem. Work fulltime is too much and I get stressed. I get stressed I get paranoid. It’s a cruel cycle and a good reason I’m on disability.

176202770,You might find a way to look into that guy’s history and see if he’s done this before. Then you could testify against him in court if he ever traumatizes another girl. I think the fact that you found the situation so unpleasant and so confusing argues strongly that if it wasn’t rape it was sexual assault. I think it was a rape.
176202771,Cool. Very impressed.

176202780,"Got that lately, faint whispers occasionally, can’t make out what they’re saying, easy to distract against. It’s much better than when the voices were clear and picking on me"
176202781,Yes. Hon and the kids watch all kinds of shows and movies…downstairs…out of my viewing way.
176202782,"me too, i feel the same way. but god will punish them for what they did. I just dont understand why they did it to me. The took advantage of me. Like im just a piece of meat. It effected me for a while, when i got older i learn to cope with my feelings."

176202785,what do you mean.
176202786,The meat didn’t taste good to me. I only liked the salt.
176202787,"What I mean is, if a auditory hallucination voice smiles, nods or shakes their head, it moves my body. It’s not my reaction, it’s my body moving in response to their emotions and thoughts."
176202788,Hi _AT_MENTION_ Glad you are doing well!
176202789,Two years in total before last hospitalization
176202790,"Yeah… Invega caused my Major Depressive Disorder that i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. SSRI medication helped, but they caused a lot of anxiety and insomnia, switched to haldol and serequel now"
176202791,"How is everyone doing? I chose a not so healthy dinner last night and I feel bad about it. I ate a 3 cheese _NAME_, and some fries. But today is a new day. I’m going to the gym, and I plan on having a healthier dinner. I didn’t eat hardly any calories at all yesterday before my bad meal which is something I do often. So I need to not let myself starve all day, because that for me encourages unhealthy eating. As far as accepting myself, I’m really struggling. I’ve put on a lot of weight and I feel like it’s impossible to look good no matter what I do. I don’t like looking in the mirror at all. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ ."

174394358,"AA says, “Don’t compare your insides to other peoples outsides.” There ain’t nobody on earth who doesn’t have problems. Be grateful. We may have schizophrenia but if you have running water, and you don’t go to bed hungry every night and you have a roof over your head and you are using your own computer then you are better off than a billion other people around the world. You think you have the worst life and you think life is unfair? Hey, what about all the children around the world who are victims of war or orphaned or all the children exploited and sold into modern day slavery or victims of the sex trade? And a lot of them don’t live to see age nine. How fair were their short lives? It’s all about perspective. How about the millions and millions of people who die of various diseases in certain countries around the world because they have no access to treatment, that in the U.S. can be easily prevented or treated by walking 10 minutes down the block to the pharmacy and buying a dru
g over the counter for ten bucks? Life sucks for schizophrenics but how about our fellow schizophrenics around the world who are in refugee camps in some war torn country? How are their lives? How about schizophrenics who don’t have computers because they don’t have homes or food? If you look at the big picture there are worse things than being schizophrenic."
174394359,"but if honestly speaking… If I don’t find a way to get rid of this schizophrenia once and for all… I’ll probably end up like you…lol , but I should mention earlier this year, one of my moms friends literally tried hooking me up with her daughter, through my mom lol… when my mom told me, I just laughed and told her no"

176202794,"_AT_MENTION_ , its not so strange, that my aps never reduced my somatics, isn’t it? _PERSON_, ill work here now on them… What meds are you on now, do they help? I hope you are fine too, hugs, _NAME_!!!"
176202795,"Oh no _AT_MENTION_ . I know how much you care for your animal friends and particularly the love you have for your sacred neigh. If the expense is too great for you, it is worthwhile talking to your vet and explaining your mental health and living situation. When I was left homeless the local vet in _NAME_, Qld boarded my two cats for about two months free of charge to me, but paid for through a charity organisation. If you are unable to pay or your family are unable to help, p[lease get back to me. I would love to help out a fellow Australian with a love of horses if I can."
176202796,"I don’t know about it being a delusion, but it’s grandiose thinking. When I was really psychotic, I thought I was Jesus."
174394362,I stop using meds 2 weeks ago. I used to take an haldol injection so it is still circulating in the blood. but most probably it is not related to the medications. I feel completely off nothing turns me on.

176202798,what is the course…and what about when it starts considering lockdown
176202799,"I hope so just don’t want to be murdered or anyone else close to me. They say this everyday, and this girl who I used to know from high school hates me for some reason and another girl keeps calling me a freak and I don’t know why. I think it’s a hate crime."
176202800,Not really. Just added hydroxyzine for sleep. It was pointless to go.
176202801,"It usually takes a little while, but usually yeah you’re pretty much back to reality"
176202802,Stay put I know it’s hard but trying to get out and moaning about it sounds like it will prolong you having to live there.
176202803,Has any one had it where you thought your voices where controlling a crowd of people?
176202804,"Come to Canada, We have AALLL the poutine."
176202805,"Yeah, but it’s gotten to a ridiculous point. She’s constantly asking what I’m eating and how much and it’s getting irritating. I swear, if it’s okay to eat three pancakes with syrup, it’s okay to eat 3 pieces of toast with butter."
176202806,I used to. If you take it at the prescribed dose as you should you shouldn’t really have any issues long term. The issue starts when people abuse it.
176202807,"I’m glad you are being proactive. In the meantime, keep reminding yourself that you’re a good person, and good people don’t hurt other people’s feelings. You control your behavior. You’re the only one who can make you act a certain way. You can keep choosing to do the right thing."
176202808,You’ll get more positive responses there I would think.
176202809,"I have kind of stopped thinking long term because my future is very uncertain in terms of what I will be able to achieve. I live from day to day, and that makes it easier to be content. Sure I can have a bad day once in a while or go through spells where I’m not very motivated, but I try to stay positive, and I am for most of the time."

176202813,Are you on meds? If so if your in a rut there are options of changing meds. It can be a risk but it also can make a difference. Did for me. All these things you need to talk to your doctor about. Do you see a psychiatrist? Usually a good place to start and if your not feeling well or up to function you need to bring it up with them!
176202814,"I wouldn’t see it as controlling her, but if you disagree or dislike something about what someone said, you should probably tell her why you feel like that. I mean it is obviously upsetting to you her saying that so you have the right to point out to her why it is wrong of her to say it."

176202818,There’s a lot of different methods she just kinda waives her fingers and tells me to follow them. While we revisit the trauma in a safe way.
176202819,"Idk, I think they push injections because they don’t trust you to take your meds every day. it would be nice for all of us if the pdoc’s would treat the person too, and not just what the common history is of schizophrenia."
176202820,Happened to me recently
176202821,Thanks ninja Appreciate your reply Would you recommend any counting and exercise apps or websites?
176202822,I’m on disability and I’ve been buying video games since I was a kid. I have about 600 video games. My step aunt took a photo and I’m worried she’s going to try and sabotage my disability. I think she’s trying to build a case against me. She’s also using my grandmother that I live with against me. My grandmother told her about all the games I have. I have two 8 foot tall x 4 foot wide shelves. Either that or she’s going to call social services and say I’m stealing money. I’ve already had social services called on me once and a worker showed up. I’m in charge of all my grandmothers finances. My step aunt is in a battle with my family over my step grandmothers estate. My family has an iron clad will and now my step aunt is coming after me. Any advice?
176202823,Your so young! Most of my drama was just hanging in but didn’t get diagnosed till I was 29. I wasted so much of my life just hanging in. Take the meds. They work for most and move from there. If you get to 6 weeks and not working time to ask doctor about other avenues. It sucks. Who cares who you kissed. That stuff becomes memories and you live and learn. It’s not something someone young should obsess about but it’s sz that makes you so. Sort out the pills. Learn to use them to your advantage!
176202824,I like it. I like all the animals in it.
174394372,Yeah has a lot of side effects. Especially drowsyness.
176202825,My meds come out to about $2500 a month roughly if you include heart ones. Both my wife and I have benefits plans at work and there’s no limit for prescriptions on either so nothing comes out of my pocket. We can keep the plans after we retire as well.

That was my first hospital visit before i started getting stalked. I havent done anything overly crazy since then, except maybe almost ODing on risperidone.

176202860,Why are you asking? Are you feeling suicidal?
176202861,It can especially if you tell your therapist you’d like to work on your feelings of guilt. Usually my therapist works with me pretty well. I’m the one who’s insurance is being charged so that makes me in charge of where the conversations go and she helps me and gives me tools to work on things. My last therapist was like a shaman. I didn’t like that. This one just has a great way of saying the right thing non judgmental but still gearing me where I wanna be.

176202926,"The life of a mind controlled sex slave (revision)] The sun The butterfly pressing its wings open and closed has put more breath in the hour, has saved without lips what we couldn’t get close to, a summer day, floating from the pain. This was me free and also captured in that glass moment, needing more air, needing that sky. The clouds sink into each other on blue beds that creak with a little thunder. This was me holding light and dreaming of home, never landing on a safe hand. Up The butterfly eases by, the beautiful pulling away with its markings that they left like a kiss mark on a neck. This was me when the pain was heavy enough to not blow away, breathing life back into the dead air. The eye lids flutter naked as the wings, tracing with a finger the loops of the flight, where you must imagine a scissors cutting one single string, cutting and cutting, and de-programming, short, short, long, a million different pieces go together again. Waterway The sex is a driving force through the sails of 
these poems that never go very far away, wind-swept fears that spin out of control, wrecking one’s faith, over-turning one’s creativity like an upset stomach. This was me fluttering on the surface and hiding in the tender reeds, the silent sound screaming before my own. The butterfly dances, don’t you know, and lights up for you with the garden spark flickering in its lazy day. There is never a place like home, the bed that breaks the silence. _PERSON_ The butterfly landing on the shoulders of giants is less than a drop of rain in the bucket that no one can lift. The heavy pain has words written on it for someone’s use, the chore of this day that goes clear as breath they’ve wasted on me. This was me putting it back with the frenzy of wings and eyes startling the bored, lingering and getting so close to death, pinned down just like a picture perfect day, where the children play, and the mind turns its page."

176202972,"I’m in the process of switching to vraylar, since we’re on the topic. I sure hope it’s not 50%. Would a med pass trials with just 50% chance of working for positives though? My answer would be ‘no’, but I need more info on this. I will research more about it and ask my pdoc as well I really hope it works for you. It’s supposed to be weight neutral, perhaps you could start losing weight and hopefully ditch the metformin? Also the partial agonism, perhaps could help with the negatives you get from most of the atypicals. Fingers crossed dude."
176202973,Hopefully it’s not a new supplement contributing to your paranoia.
174394415,I really wanted clozapine to work. My body rejected it. So I’m taking perphenazine very little side effects. Good days after my meds kicked in.

My neighbors are a pestilence. They are always down below outside our family bathroom. I can hear them. I just used the toilet, the noise suppression is great.

176202980,I think its like putting a match to gasoline. The match is abilify and the gas is an undisciplined mind. With an unruly mind alot of drugs could trigger an addiction within that person.
174394419,What area of the brain would we target with stem cells in schizophrenia? I remember this article from a few months ago. https://www.psychcongress.com/article/tms-reduces-negative-symptoms-schizophrenia-some The left temporal lobe and the hippocampus might also be good candidates but wouldn’t introducing ipsc’s to problem areas just produce more maladapted cells?
174394407,You need to ask your pdr if the effect of two antipsychotics adds up. I will ask the same question to my pdr next week. If it is I will reduce my Risperdal. If you can’t reduce your Zyprexa then increase Abilify.
176202981,"Heya leaf! Morning! Today we’ve got the maids coming, so I’ve got to straighten up so they can deep clean. After that maybe some video games. All in all a lazy day I think. Might try to get some writing done. Wishing you well!"
174394412,Let’s put this in perspective. Former superstar point guard and very good free throw shooter _NAME_ basically missed a free throw for every schizophrenic that got hired.
176202982,Are you saying that you’ve decided to come off some of your meds?
176202983,I didn’t ask for a diagnosis just wondering what it could be?
176202984,I sometimes wonder about people who have SZ and left untreated and who committed suicide or homicide listening to their voices… I feel terrible for for them… violence isn’t the answer
176202985,Gonna need an anticonvulsant for that. Please talk to the pdoc.
176202986,"I respect you a lot and I know you believe in your stuff, but despite my lack of training and intelligence, my stuff is real.

176202990,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ I’ll share my story of ‘moderate’ success since being dz as a person with sz. I’m 42, was dz at age 23. In the 20 years, I’d say I’ve been employed about 2/3 of the time. Helpful was having a degree and not experiencing + symptoms. I participated in a wonderful fellowship called Jump Start when I was about 30, it gave me confidence and I was able to meet other like-minded peers. I had a few really good paying jobs early on after graduating. As time progressed, I sought the right job and not the right now job. I recently got back on disability after four years working in marketing/ sales. Social anxiety is a tough one but gets better with age. I’ve had two gfs, each lasting about a year. Again, it’s important to find the right one and not necessarily the first one who comes your way. But beggars can’t be choosers, sz is not a particularly a trait in demand!"
176202991,"I tried but it’s so hard.I went back to cigarette when I was quitting vape.I probably enjoy the vape more,that’s why I still buy them"
176202992,"When I’m having a hard time with my symptoms, or even life in general, I can be a straight up bi tch, and I imagine myself trying to reach out but failing as I have before, and suddenly, the post doesn’t make them seem like an ass, but like a suffering human. There are some things that have to go and I get it, but it’s very possible to defend the person being yelled at while still supporting the person doing the yelling. Also, I get that trolls are a different story, but I’m not good enough at differentiating between trolling, trying to be funny, or just being an annoying person, to have any business flagging people for trolling."
176202993,Friends are like badgers nothing but trouble I think it is better to just have aquaintances …

176203005,Maybe you’re just having a moment ? Happens 2 me way too often.
174394418,_AT_MENTION_ . My pdoc diagnosed me with sza. I just am having trouble believing certain things that I’m told are delusions aren’t real.
176203006,U guys are Indian by Birth…???
176203007,I get like that sometimes. Hang in there. We care about you. Maybe do something nice for yourself to feel a little better?
176203008,I’m sorry to hear that. YouTube does attract it’s fair share of trolls who probably should be in a place for the criminally insane .
176203009,"My symptoms got better. I was pretty sick at the beginning and spent the entire 80’s in hospitals, group homes and mental health housing. From 1990-95 I was in a board & care home but I was working and going to school. In 1995-2015 I lived in 'normal"" society, working, taking classes and renting rooms in peoples houses. My life is now a 100% different then in the beginning of my disease. The first couple years I did not function. No job, no school, no money, no car, no friends, no independence, very little sanity. Now my symptoms are manageable and I get around pretty well."

174394424,"Abilify’s addictions and hypersexuality were too much to handle in my case, they put me in trouble and at the end they almost damaged my life permanently. I won’t go into details as its illegal stuff and Abilify almost damaged my personality permanently especially the hypersexuality. I emptied my bank account and was retracting cash from my Visa, I was working full time and more broke than now in bed. My parents paid my debts and I told the psychiatrist about those issues, he said its possible and stopped the Abilify. No more issues now. They were worse than my current negative symptoms."
176203012,"no luck. A few weeks ago, I stopped this elderly woman who lives in my apartment complex, for a friendly conversation, and I thought we got along great. I talked with her a couple of times just friendly chatter. Then, one day, I ran into her and asked her if it would be alright if I came over to her apartment sometime for a visit. She told me no she did not have any time in her life for me. I was heartbroken. Ever since I moved into my apartment complex a year ago, I have been inviting another woman to come visit me at my apartment “any time she sees fit”. She has never taken me up on it in all this past year. Today, I asked her why she never comes over. She told me that she “never knows when I am sleeping”. So, today, I asked her if she would like some company. She told me no she didn’t. I was heartbroken over that too. I can count on one hand the number of friends that I’ve had in my lifetime. I’m just no good at making friends. That’s why I’m always alone. My aloneness used to 
bother me terribly when I was younger. Now, I could care less because I am so used to it now. Sure is a good thing I got God. I don’t know what I’d do without Him."

176203017,Lithium is not an antipsychotic. It is a mineral that is used to treat bi-polar depression. It works completely differently.
176203018,Hi _AT_MENTION_ Both Zyprexa and Depakote slow down your metabolism and they both also increase your appetite at the same time. Starving yourself is not the solution. Keeping more active and eating less junk food helps. You are on a very low dose of Depakote so weight gain with this drug should not be a problem. Counting calories helps me.
176203019,Are you on vacation or work or? Dumb question
176203020,Sometimes. It comes and goes. I’m struggling with that a lot right now because my meds are working and I suspect I’ve just been poisoned into thinking I’m sick but the meds don’t really do anything but cause really bad side effects. But there’s a tiny part of me rolling my eyes at myself for being irrational. But the much nicer out of me wants to go off meds to test.

176203041,"Two things can happen: Card issuer gets tired of you disputing charges and closes your account, and you owe any balance left. You get sued. So what? First, they have to notify you, and you have 30 days to respond. Essentially, you have 30 days to pay $15 to a debt collector, who will then close your file. If you wait beyond 30 days, and some nutbag debt collector actually sues, you’re on the hook for $15 + court costs which are usually around $300 give or take. There’s your worst case scenarios. Relax."
174394430,About a month. Then I switched to abilify.
176203042,Yes it hurts me psychologically and it reduces my self confidence feeling inferior. I’m stuck at home too. Sometimes I wish I could erase memories of me without sz to be more stable and normal.
176203043,The school did an IQ test on me and found I had a near photographic memory. The school also had me labeled as mentally disturbed in 4th grade. Looking back in retrospect I think I was a sociopath as a kid. I started doing drugs when I was 14. I ended up with psychosis when I was 19. My first symptoms I can recall were at age 16. I think being a sociopath combined with drugs led to psychosis. When I was hospitalized no one told the doctors I was doing drugs. They just labeled me as schizophrenic because I had all the classic symptoms.
176203044,Im horny AF.

176203048,"people are saying that to me but one lawyer said yea that got me worried most people said no. I ask around the internet and lawyers said unlikely, but just one said yes."
176203049,Yes…im in the same boat as you kind of(my sz is delusional heavy). Identifying your symptoms is good and kinda grounding. Learn how to cope with each specific “delusion” youre struggling with and go from there. Are you on psych meds
176203050,Well start. If people are taking advantage of you than they don’t deserve common courtesy. I’ve been in your shoes and I know how hard it is to say no once they get their hooks in you. I had to cut my house mate off because he was knocking on my door two times a day for a couple bucks. It eventually ended up that he owed me over a hundred dollars. I got it back but he was making my hard life even harder. He didn’t care. These people who borrow money continually are selfish people and most of them probably don’t care about you except to get money from you. It’s your money; you don’t owe them anything.
176203051,So u do accept psychiatrists make a lot of money… well that’s a start.
176203052,You are not stupid. People make mistakes

176203057,"NO! From what I’ve read on here for years the majority of the time it is a huge mistake to disclose a mental illness to an employer and especially schizophrenia. If the employer is looking at 5 resumes of 5 people who are equally suitable for the job most likely he will ignore or throw the one that says “schizophrenia” in the trash. Most likely they don’t know anything but bad stuff about schizophrenia. There’s always exceptions but I’ve heard the stories of people who disclose and it’s a good way to be singled out and picked on and treated unfairly. You are under no obligation to tell a prospective employer that you have schizophrenia. In a perfect world it should not matter as long as you can pull your own weight. But this world is a million miles from perfect and _USER_ID_, ignorance, and downright meanness is alive and kicking in the work place."
176203058,It’s never too late to start. I got serious at about 45 or so and it makes a difference. I too love eating but it’s still worthwhile to try.

176203060,"When I had psychosis, I thought online articles were about me too.

176203067,"It is not your fault in any way. Predators are good at manipulating kids to make them think nothing is wrong with what they are doing, and getting them to participate. Kids don’t know what is normal and what is not, so they rely on adults to show them. If an adult shows you that is normal, you have no way of knowing otherwise at 9."
174394439,"I always was a dumb, slow kid that lacked social skills, but things came easy for me when I tried. The schizophrenia hit me a year after college in one day, one instant. Before that, I noticed I struggled more in college. The difficulty and learning curve was high. I realized I was with some of the brightest and smartest people and professors. I feel like I studied more than most but not in a smart way. I sometimes make the excuse I suffered from cognitive decline before then. I also noticed caffeine worsened my memory, but I kept drinking them when I was stressed and needed to study. I had a hard time finding motivation and the drinks helped me. I was smarter as a young kid. No one encouraged me and I was definitely not a savant. I think my IQ was 130 or so before schizophrenia. Not sure what it is now, but it might be 110-120."

176203080,So I planned to do laundry this morning but somebody got in ahead of me. grrr. Didn’t have this problem when I was living alone. Living alone spoiled me.

176203082,"I am not consistently happy. I have this esteem hole I have to fill with accomplishments of some sort, lest it empty out and make me feel useless again. Were you good at some kind of sport as a youth? If you reconnect to that you can feel good again. I recently got back into FPS gaming and just a few minutes of it gave me an esteem boost that lasted for hours . This is even with meds."
176203083,99% of the time except when posting my fears and paranoia. Other than that im good…
176203084,"Its all in your head. Actually people don’t care whether people have schizo, depression or any other as they themselves have many other issues and things to care about."
176203085,"That’s good! Sadly, I tried coming off meds 3 times and I ended in the hospital brought by 4 cops because I was paranoid, was hullicinating, delusional and aggressive. I still had positive, negative and cognitive symptoms without meds until I reexperienced psychosis after a year."
176203086,They tell me the same that iam the weakest person ever in the whole entire cosmos and will be going to hell for it and raped tortured eaten by dogs and drowned
176203087,No such thing as witch craft.
174394440,"Psychosis (positive symptoms of hallucinations and/or delusions) can only be treated with an antipsychotic (AP), so tell your psychiatrist (pdoc) about your positive symptoms. I can’t stress that enough. Don’t cancel your appointment with your therapist (not trusting them is paranoia, a positive symptom). Tell your therapist about your positive symptoms, and that you can’t wait to the 14th to see your pdoc (maybe your therapist can persuade your pdoc to see you sooner). It’s a good sign that you have an awareness of your positive symptoms; many people with schizophrenia don’t have that. Until the 14th, keep the stress as low as possible. Try to stay busy doing things that you enjoy. Have a routine, do the same things at the same times. Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep per night. Try not to isolate; post on here as often as you need. If your symptoms get worse call a crisis line immediately. You’re going to be okay."
176203088,"He used to visit me and tell me I had to do things. He’d make deals with me, trade offs. I’m so glad he hasn’t been around in a while."

176203092,"Ok guys, I am going to take a break for the night. I’ll pick back up tomorrow."
174394444,I don’t have psychosis anymore. I’m left with mostly negative symptoms.
176203093,Only temporary blurriness. Never lasted more than a couple days.
176203094,You should be dr.dre lol
176203095,I think it is just a side effect of the med. I had it more on a higher concentration
176203096,"Idk really. I was copying a portrait on Pinterest. And as usual, it doesn’t look like the Pinterest person. I’ll let you decide."
176203097,"I achieved a 3.9 GPA at community college and stellar extracurricular activities. I did well given I was isolated my whole life, didn’t have friends, and probably have Asperger’s Syndrome. I have no motivation, drive, energy, or focus without energy drinks. Makes me think I’m like low energy or something…"
176203098,Thats interesting do the voices ever stop if so when?(other than sleepin)
176203099,Well i napped for 2hours and i am much better
176203100,yes i will talk to a nurse in a week or so
176203101,mothering my children
176203102,"But I can’t admit myself. Also, they don’t take all admissions and most admissions are involuntary. I would go if I was alone but honestly admitting myself is not ordinary here."
176203103,Should i be worried. I juat wanna live that _USER_ID_ life fo sho son and smoke some weed. Im hungry for it. Which maybe is a bad thing
176203104,"Honestly a good support system is probably highly influential on success for any mental illness, especially psychotic disorders. Support is even more important while we are trying to find the right meds. Also minimizing stress where you can is probably also super important."
176203105,Every so often.
174394445,"_PERSON_ its better to stick to what works in my experience bcz there isn’t any meds for negative symptoms. I had life-threatening side effects from switching meds and an antidepressant made me worse, not being able to work, called Wellbutrin. I stopped it a couple months ago and I still can’t work. I worked for 9 consecutive months before taking Wellbutrin. I lost my concentration and I became paranoid fearing work place and workers there bcz of Wellbutrin."
176203106,I dont really care about dating anymore eventhough I had a gf for 5yrs. My health is more important and I can barely take care of myself.
176203107,yea youre probably right. during the nights im alone i have been playing alot of world of warcraft so maybe i will try to make friends with people on there so i can enjoy the game more.
176203108,I am tired of staying in bed and nothing can be done other than stopping all my meds. I want to fast from my meds.
176203109,Did it help before you stopped?
176203110,"Lexapro was the first antidepressant I ever tried. Boy it was horrible, definitely the worst. Gave me unbelievable anxiety to panic attack level and made my jaw stiff and felt like I was being gagged. I lasted like 3 days on it before dropping it I think. But you can’t really go off of other people’s experiences because everyone reacts to these meds differently. What was a nightmare to me could be someone else’s perfect med that controls all their symptoms and gives no side effects."
176203111,I was last in psych hospital Mar 8 1983 .
176203112,It’s hard to open up. CBT AND DBT sound like good choices. Wish you the best!
176203113,I guess bipolar can come with negatives then. That’s interesting. Could you have sza bipolar type? Or are you only psychotic when you’re manic?
176203114,Amazing painting!!
176203115,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ ! I really tried to mix this one real over the top to fit the tone
176203116,_AT_MENTION_ I’ll tell my daughter they can occur without pain. That would be good if that’s it.

176203121,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
174394449,I laughed out loud a lot. At work. For no seemingly apparent reason although I could sense humour myself. Near the end it was absolutely obvious that something was going on. One thing I never did thou was talk out loud to the voices. I know some ppl do that
176203122,"You’re basically saying that people will randomly insult you for no reason. People just aren’t that vicious. We are absolute fiends to ourselves, subconsciously. It’s being projected on to what we sense, in a manner only we can perceive."
176203123,"Yes, with assertivity. If it doesn´t work don´t interact with that person anymore. That´s a very clever question, _AT_MENTION_ . Where are you going?"

176203131,I don’t have sz just psychosis
176203132,I don’t understand why voices stick around when paranoia left a long time ago. I agree it should be easier to find medicine that works.
176203133,"All l can say is that I’m trying to get over my need of everyone liking me. Besides, there are certain people I don’t think I like because they’re just trouble, really."
174394455,"I currently take Seroquel, Effexor, and Prazosin. I still get “visions”, but they keep my mind pretty quiet. As for negative symptoms… I’m still struggling and would also benefit from others’ take on what helps them in that aspect."
176203134,"I feel like maybe I’ll never recover. Everybody said I had a good prognosis, and yet 5 years later, I’ve just deteriorated."
176203135,Yes I’m gonna say to them that i dont want it anymore
176203136,I had social anxiety disorder as a teenager.

176203139,"I don’t have much personal experience with this. When I tried stopping geodon on my own, I had to restart it and take a much higher dose than I originally was on.

176203140,"Yeah, lumateperone has already been approved."
176203141,Latuda is a good drug to be on.
176203142,I used to have catastrophic thinking. Where I’d worry about the worst possible outcome for everything. Now I’d say I worry appropriately. That just sounds like you’re planning ahead. I do a lot of that.

176203154,"Don’t give up. Life can and does get better with time if you work closely with a good pdoc and keep taking your meds as prescribed. I know. I’m living proof of it. I spent over 30 years paranoid, delusional, depressed, suicidal, psychotic, and hallucinating, all the while taking all kinds of typical neuroleptic AP’s, that didn’t work, in the 80’s, 90’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s. It wasn’t until 2016 that my pdoc discovered the right combination of atypical AP’s that worked for me."
176203155,thats like doing tai chi? or chi gong? if it helps you then thats great.

That lady wrote about 6 or 7 pages of negative stuff about me which basically just said I was in distress. All from saying that thing looks like a bat. What can I say. It looked like a bat to me. I hear if you say they remind you of something sexual you do alright. I am sorry that happened to you. But I can’t believe anyone would take those results seriously. They actually put those results in my medical records.

I’ve tried most if not all of them. I can literally come up with a study that says candy causes anxiety in excess and people would believe it.

I still can’t read books on my own, it helps to have the ebook though. A few months ago, I downloaded a ebook on my phone through Amazon Kindle, and it was much easier to read because you can adjust the font, the spacing, color to make it easier on the eyes. I find following large paragraphs and long lines to be hard to track (maybe I have some kind of dyslexia). When I do have to read a hard copy, I get a book mark and follow the page by blocking the upcoming words and scroll down, it helps me focus and my mind doesn’t wander as bad, memory is still absolutely horrible but at least I’m not repeating daily thoughts in my head."

Thanks for your post I think I talk about my problems a lot too. Maybe it’s because of a fragile ego but not a conceited ego imo. But that doesn’t make us weak. Your will is different.

176203217,Hey everyone
174394471,I increased my dose from 10mg to 15mg. I became more stable but the anxiety and restlessness increased for me too. However I take over the counter supplements to counteract the anxiety/restlessness now. (Broccoli sprout extract and L-theanine). My life was a misery on 10mg looking back.
174394480,My negatives were awful. To the point I thought about quitting the injection. But adding Abilify made me feel human again.

She runs out a couple weeks early each month and then has nothing for pain. She has asked me to dole out her lyrica so she doesn’t take too much. What would you do in this situation? I don’t want her to overdose, I know the oxy’s are pretty strong."

I still hate my disease and hallucinations but at least I’m sane now. I was in your shoes for a couple years after this all started, I roamed all over town and broke things and got in trouble with the law doing what the voices told me to. Medicine and support is the only thing that worked for me. I really hope a couple years from now you can also be free of the delusions that are part of the illness. Then you can have more casual conversations with some of the friendly people here, that’s what I do."

174394483,"Primary polydipsia Primary polydipsia describes excessive thirst and water intake caused in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both psychogenic primary polydipsia and non-psychogenic primary polydipsia, such as in patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis with severely elevated globulin levels.[4] Psychogenic polydipsia is an excessive water intake[1] seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, and/or the developmentally disabled. It should be taken very seriously, as the amount of water ingested exceeds the amount that can be excreted by the kidneys,[1] and can on rare occasions be life-threatening as the body’s serum sodium level is diluted to an extent that seizures and cardiac arrest can occur. All I’m doing is giving information. Wikipedia goes into more detail of this condition. Consulting a doctor is best for your problem."

Their families were terrible and abusive. No friends to speak of. Homeless. Criminal past related to their illness or substance abuse. I had no idea how to really help these people. As soon as they left the hospital they were doomed to return and many of them had been stuck in that vicious cycle. I tried my best to work with them to see how we could achieve their goals.

I watched _PERSON_ battle angel the other day, I think it come out a while ago… it wasn’t anime, but, it had a lot of digital animation in it, the main character reminded me of anime.

When I was in the hospital, we were at lunch and I asked to go to the restroom. Of course, the answer was no, and I tried to hold it, but I couldn’t, and I peed right there, and guess what? No one cared. A few people asked if I was okay, and I was allowed to shower and change instead of going to group. I’ve wet the bed before too. Relatively often for someone my age. But it’s really not that big of a deal. Wash up, put my clothes and blankets in the washing machine, clean the bed, place a few towels and switch fitted sheets, then back to bed.

176203465,"I’ve never had a psychiatrist even hint of changing my diagnosis due to _USER_ID_. I think most psychiatrists adhere to high ethical standards. That said, some psychiatrists are on the payroll (usually via symposia) of large pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, to name a few. This is legal, but I think, at best, it gives the appearance of impropriety. Also, I think psychiatrists should inform patients of FDA warnings on medications that they’re prescribing, especially a black box warning, which is the strictest labeling requirement that the FDA can mandate for prescription drugs. All in all, I think the vast majority of psychiatrists tell the truth, but some do omit information from their patients."

We are talking, joking, playing. My son is very cuddly this week. I love having him with me all week…normally he just stays with me 3 afternoons and 1 night a week. Son made a friend here too.

176203469,If it’s just a certain word that replays in my head I find if I look for a positive word with the same first letter I can swap the intrusive for the positive quite quickly. It’s hard always being so on my thoughts. Phrases are trickier; I just pin it off as intrusive thoughts and hope for the best. The one thing I will not do under any circumstances is ruminate over them and judge myself for them as that makes it worse!

174394545,depends on the school for america. i know you’re in canada. my grades are too horrible for a graduate program. i dont even have a ba/bs. i wouldnt even survive. i have a 3.9 for 3 years at junior college and a 2.9 or something at a UC for 1.5 years. I just assume it’s a 2.9 and my upper division math courses consist of 2 Ps and some Cs. I ?????? myself. Only good thing is it’s been 9+ years and I had schizophrenia. I could technically turn it into a success story or a turn around and go back to a local school and get good grades and then re-apply and write a compelling essay/story on how i recovered and stuff. I don’t know. I really dont want to do school for the forseeable future… have you tried edx or coursera? they got classes from top unis covering almost everything.

174394541,"Therapy isnt for everybody, its helps some and for some it doesnt. I guess if your problem is psychological then it helps but if its neurotransmitter imbalance/medical its just good to pass time. It was just to pass time for me with my therapist but nothing changed, I still wasnt able to do what I want to do. So me saying what I want to my therapist and having my therapist just repeat my words didnt help. I got angry at my therapist at the end as she got mad at me as I didnt do a thing and blamed me for my negative symptoms. I told her to fk off and I am better now. She was making me depressed by saying that I dont want to improve. Ill stick with psychiatrists, thanks."

174394533,You should trust your doctor and relax a bit. The stuff you’ve described is classic schizophrenia and hopefully the right meds will be of help.
176203505,"I enjoyed your view on things. I can tell you’ve done some inner self work which I think is the only (be it hard) way through it. Many here get voices about Hell, few see this Sz as a chance to actually do the work and stop torturing ones self. I have a theory that we here (on this board) are all broken from trauma and lost our faith and trust in life. So to trace back to how we got so lost and forgive ourselves and others and see how we could have reacted differently with the end results being to bring peace. I also think the voices are a mix of spirits (both here and past over) of many levels so that in itself can be confusing - but add to it a our own damaged ego and it becomes a personal torture chamber (but it’s escapable). We all have triggers (points of pain caused by the past) and overcoming them and not having fear or holding onto pain and anger is the actual key to gaining freedom. Also it’s all things you allow to enter your body. To gain control is to think about not only the food 
but also the media consumed."

176203515,I’m sad because I have to stay on the shot in addition to the clozapine
174394551,My doctor told me there was dosing at any level because they have the option to mix the medication themselves when ordering. When I was decreasing my abilify my doctor ordered kits for mixing the injection and he could mix the right dose. Maybe your doctor can do that if they don’t make lower dose shots.

I notice so much more clarity from the fog but I can tell I need a much higher dose. I found a doctor to give me prescription cbd so I’ll keep you updated. Just a reminder this does not get you high but in studies it shows that brains that were previously studied who experience psychosis once went back to normal after taking high dose cbd.

176203594,You can stop most antipsychotics without too much dependence. They do work over placebo for a lot of people. It’s not a perfect technology though so there are problems. Still. They do help.

In _NAME_’s new book, When Neurons Tell Stories A Layman’s Guide to the Neuroscience of Mental Illness and Health, she brings neuroscience to life by postulating why neuroanatomy and neurochemicals matter when you are living with mental illness and addiction. _NAME_, whose graduate education is in Neuroscience, works as a peer support worker in Vancouver, Canada; the stories told in this book are those of her clients. _NAME_’s empathy for her clients is built on her own diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this book, she opens for the layman the neuroscience that may underlie not only the symptoms of mental illness and addiction, but also mental health more broadly. _NAME_ holds an MSc in Neuroscience. She was the recipient of multiple scholarships, including two Natu

If somebody gets a large support package and lives in supported housing/group home with 31 hours one-to-one support hours a week, funding for 4 days in NHS day centre. has a appointee that manages Finances as deemed not to have not mental capacity when unwell, money is managed by social services, been told they often lack insight into their SZA. Does this mean this person is low functioning? I am diagnosed with a Intellectual Disability as well as Schizoaffective disorder. Does this mean I’m low functioning? What does low functioning mean to you?"

176203622,Hi. I take amisulpride since 1999 and I have today morbid obesity. But obesity is a problem on both side of the family so we should not extrapolate side effects that are different for each case.

Then they turn south and it’s hell for a week. If I could figure out what was causing the voice to be positive rather than negative, maybe I could come out on top. I have positive hallucinations mostly when things are going great otherwise. However that just makes it feel like a betrayal when the voice turns mean, because the nicer they are the more I treat them like people, and then when they turn on me I have to once again wash my hands of the idea of them being people. Then they turn nice and it all starts again, the back and forth… well I don’t know how to put it to words. Thanks for the response it means a lot to me, I value pretty much all input. If the voices stayed positive I don’t think they’d give me nearly as much grief."

Then maybe my disability might get extended for two years and then after two years will get extended indefinitely more likely.

I will talk with my psydoc if I definitely need to get hospitalized to extend my disability, I am really anxious as hospitals in my country are dehumanizing and I feel really uncomfortable and anxious there and usually makes my SZ worse."
176203655,I had it. It just messed with my memory.
176203656,"Have you studied executive function in school yet? It’s the brain process that allows you to break big tasks into smaller, more achievable tasks. So instead of looking at “must cook meal” a typical brain would say “must get ingredients out of fridge, measure them, turn on stove, etc.”. When someone has executive function disorder, their brain doesn’t do that automatically. Instead, it gets stuck on the end result (food must be eaten) with no clear idea of how to get to that point. So you sit there paralyzed with confusion and anxiety, and maybe try to distract yourself from those bad feelings by surfing the web or other, easier tasks. I suffer from this big time, as a result of my brain damage. It helps me to have someone walk me through the exact steps of a process a few times, until my brain memorizes the steps. So I had Mr. Star teach me how to load the dishwasher correctly, or I watched YouTube to learn how to cook certain specific meals, etc, and I can now usually do those tasks au
tomatically. When there is a minor bump in the road (we are out of ingredient x, there’s a new weirdly shaped dish and I don’t know where it goes, etc) I sometimes need help figuring out how to compensate. On my better days, I can figure out a creative solution on my own."

174394580,Dp/dr is an anxiety disorder. Mine was horrendous. Destroyed my life. Worse than schizophrenia. Imagine having both. I felt dead inside. Solipsism + cotards syndrome. Can’t help but think it was reptilians from Mars doing this to me. Felt like eye transplant. I took supplements that increased dopamine or activity in my occipital lobe. It helped a ton. Not sure if there were consequences like paranoia and psychosis. Even topamax helped but caused 10/10 psychosis. I have less motivation now than ever. At least I’m realistic and happy now. Im barely suffering. I randomly think about simulation theory throughout the day instead of 24/7 because of distorted sense and visual perception damage/issues.

176203670,"According to a study my psychologist showed me, most people have intrusive thoughts. It’s not necessarily the illness causing them, rather it’s being made worse by the paranoia. I did not find this particularly helpful at the time as they were so intense. They have faded away now for the moment, and for the most part. I still have a firm belief in my ‘delusions’, but I have given up with trying to inform people about my discoveries whilst psychotic as no one is interested. Don’t waste your time with them. If there is anything past this plain of existence, we’ll all find out in the end. I hope there will be an experience after death, but I can’t tell you what form my energy will take next time I come back, if I was to be so lucky."

176203706,what topics do you think I should cover…im starting a social anxiety support group in my local clubhouse lookin for ideas what you think
176203707,This is interesting. I always thought that the meds controlled the sz symptoms and therefore stifled it from overpowering the brain into creating a tolerance building or work around because it targets the very cause. That’s not true now I realise because the condition is after all medically considered incurable. Looks like. I should expect a psychotic breakdown rather than living as though or with the expectation that I am going to be okay. Because given off what you have stated and also what I have seen elsewhere now that I think about it. Psychotic breaks can happen regardless of how well you deal with stress it seems? Because the brain can backfire at a moments notice if the cause of sz wants it to happen it seems. I don’t know what to think about it all now. Bit worried. Bit deflating. Unfortunate situation we are all in… very unfortunate or difficult condition for us all to be fighting/coping/experiencing.

I’m more motivated and have some life back in me. I hated those days laying in bed with just my thoughts. It’s a horrendous feeling and depression is a horrendous thing to be dealing with as well. I feel you will do well because I was there and we can still live a pretty normal life if we want to. I wanted to get better so anything I would have done to get me out of that rut I was in. I’ve a long way to go but small steps is all we can do. I didn’t even want to go to the bathroom I was so depressed and wanted to just lay in bed and sleep it away.

I don’t smoke thc anymore, but I thought I’d try cbd again, and basically I’m stoned, heart slightly racing and glassy red eyes, just from hemp. Is it possible for certain people to be wired to get a buzz from cbd? I mean, I like the cbd buzz but I don’t know why most people just take cbd and have no effect, what’s the point, how boring.

I applied and was given a shot at the job. You have three months to pass the _NAME_ Insurance Council Level 1 General Agent licensing exam. I managed to pass it within 3 weeks. Passed Level 2 a year later, which means I can work without supervision (Level 1 have to be under supervision of Level 2 or 3). I’m a commercial insurance specialist, I help businesses find custom solutions that fit their needs.

I was thinking I might have schizophrenia personality disorder because the positive symptoms seem to explain a lot (more than my initial diagnosis at least), especially having consistently unusual perceptions/beliefs that you can later detach from or disagree with . But I don’t know if I have any negative symptoms - in social situations I react visibly and appropriately. The closest to a negative symptom I’ve had is that I haven’t been able to bring myself to accomplish any important life tasks for about a year and a half now and have been living in eternal neverending tangents.

But at least two jobs that I can remember, a co-worker tipped me off that the managers were thinking of firing me so I made a conscious effort to work faster and harder and I improved and they didn’t fire me.

174394618,"I took a course of sorts on “mad studies”, basically a movement that is modeled after many other minority/disadvantaged ‘studies’ (think gender, ethnicity, disability and so on). It is a self-proclaimed emancipatory movement/field that sees no distinction between research and activism, and thinks of psychiatry as an oppressive powerstructure. A lot of fuss about how to call patients/consumers/clients/survivors (survivors of psychiatry as an institution, not of psychiatric conditions as such that is). Clearly the best case for power can be made with respect to involuntary treatment in psychotic conditions (for something like ADHD this is a lot more difficult to maintain i would think). But I agree wholeheartedly with this article in that the psychotic condition is not one in which we have full agency for what we think (delusions). This is not a case of us simply having an uncommon opinion that should be respected, similar to how a minority opinion on politics or whatever should not end in in
voluntary treatment or confinement. In fact, in my mind that is to severely underestimate the psychotic condition, and indeed, it shuts the door to treatment that can greatly benefit our wellbeing in times when we are not able to see that ourselves. Of course, we would all like to be able to freely make up our minds at all times, but this is precisely what we cannot do in delusion. Perhaps this is missed by those who cannot distinguish between research and activism, and wishful thinking may override an understanding of what is actually going on Our shortest road to the ability to freely make up our minds again may at times very well be through involuntary measures."

A better term for negative symptoms in schizo is affective flattening or blunted affect or in a more severe form called flat affect. This is why depressive people get strong negative emotions which make them angry, suicidal etc while in schizo and other conditions this strong emotion either happy or sad is not there and thus they wont likely affected by those situations, thoughts, criticism etc. In depression antidepressants actually numb those emotions so that those negative emotions won’t likely affect the individual as much but the side affect is it also numb all emotions equally, its like taking alcohol or sedative to feel nothing."

176203864,"You have been doing so good, and most of us with this disease can’t work. I have had difficulty keeping a job since getting this illness. The only advice I would give is really try your hardest to hold onto the job. I mean really try. Then if you feel you can’t go on at all after that then okay throw in the towel. But also try to have another job lined up or some kind of income stream opened. You are strong. You will get through this. Keep on fighting."
176203865,"I believe the mentally ill brain is suffering from an excessive amount of oxidative stress that the brain can’t bounce back from. It gets progressively more stressed, as anxiety and symptoms trigger more of the same usually. The only way to win that fight is to load the diet with antioxidants that heal the brain, and not mostly pro-oxidants like the typical western diet has."

176203868,I have been on risperdal too but it made me gain so much weight and I was drewling and slurred speech. I will just give it some time. Maybe it’s someone else I’m feeling because it doesn’t feel like me really. Not impossible it’s me but may not be.
176203869,"There is no a genetic blueprint in advance to produce the sz health condition or its symptoms,because it is a new health condition add suddenly in the 20’s of age by action of _NAME_-psychological factor (H) to the current biological and psychological health conditions of the human being So,if both the biological /psychological states of the human being are genetic in birth (origin) and the functional activities is managed by genetic directions . In actual reality,the sz condition in itself isolated with all its characteristics from all the other conditions ,it is considered existentially /functionally Independent of the biological /psychological conditions of the human being It is not expression that arise from a disease that affects the biological health condition ,and it is not an expression that arise from an autologous illness in the mental health condition For example,the viral disease is not hereditary in origin but rather affects the genetic chemistry which in turn causing a functional di
sorder Poisoning with a drug is not hereditary in origin but it affects the genetic chemistry Likewise,the sz condition is not hereditary in origin but rather it affects the genetic chemistry (it misuse it in what does not benefit the psychological user -the person with sz- in achieving his personal desires and needs ) In terms of similarities,sz condition is a state resembles a state of mental health of the human being,but for many reasons it is considered more advanced and evolution in itself than the mental health state of the human creature (despite what it causes serious symptoms /suffering that threaten the security / stability of the human host’s life Notice that,dozens of people everyday become infected with sz,while you can not find single person completely cured from the sz ( despite all kinds of treatment methods that are offered to the person with sz ) This means that,the sz’s pathogen (H) precedes our treatment methods with many steps !! All are occupied with testing a new medications without 
finding the ideal treatment of sz itself or even some of its symptoms"
176203870,Any other conversations with this voice? Do you really hear voices?
176203871,I though you said therapy didnt help you that much anyway. I would definitely take a break.
176203872,"I’ve been taking quetiapine 400 x 2 daily for over a decade. It doesn’t have that much of an affect on me. For a while I didn’t think it was having any effect, but then I didn’t get it for five days, and I was pretty uncomfortable."
176203873,I turned 60 last February.

176203875,"It is, but very often, kids in foster care get slapped with alphabet soup diagnoses for simply displaying symptoms of trauma. For a number of reasons that are very frustrating and off topic"
176203876,yea that sounds like they messed up badly. I’d sue them too… it’s really bad on their part what they did to you… they should have seen the fracture huh…
176203877,I’m on lithium and it makes me extremely tired and nauseated. My sleep goes from 14 or more hours to 2 or 3 hours. I hope they can help. I had a terrible time using zopiclone and withdrawal was horrible. Gravol kind of helps with no addiction problems.
174394642,Things that are not my effing fault: Being schizophrenic Being abused Your problems The effing weather
176203878,"I take Clopixol and Seroquel, both at low doses."
176203879,Maybe he thinks that getting a new bf will help you.
174394649,I used to have a ‘best friend’ but she parted ways from me a few years later. Idk why. Maybe I wasn’t interesting enough.
176203880,That great ! I felt better after a dose increase too. But it sounds like it’s really really worked for you !
176203881,You too _AT_MENTION_ !
176203882,"Part of the problem I have is no matter how unwell I am, I have this compulsion to apply for jobs… I am not sure if I am supposed to…But I can’t stand this."
174394643,"I work at a pizza shop, I make pizzas and do food prep. Pretty easy, but sometimes frustrating."
176203883,Yes I think so too… I’m not sure if this okay to share but this is _PERSON_…
176203884,Pretty sure it swings between delusional and not delusional.
174394650,I had a med clinic appointment yesterday. They checked my weight I lost 8 pounds and when they took my blood pressure it was so good she said she use to dread taking my blood pressure because it was always so bad. We talked about abilify the pdoc said for some people it’s really sweating others it’s like the equivalent to taking speed. I’m in the middle its clearing the fog out of my brain.
176203885,I take statins for high cholesterol. I probably could do better with diet but it’s still a problem so it’s something I do. These things are pretty easily controlled with medications these days. If your worried about liver then I’ve had doctors recommend Milk Thistle. It’s all about your diet and stuff like alcohol in the scheme of things… Talk to a regular doctor and get some regular blood tests. I’m 50. These things are common in my life these days.
176203886,I find it scary wen they told me I’m going to hell during first psychosis cos they seem to be able to make me feel things so it makes me wonder wat other powers they have. But then again who said there’s such thing as hell. Idk if there really is. Maybe not.
176203887,I came across someone in the ward who also had schizophrenia
176203888,I’m in therapy for PTSD but it’s slow moving and the DID complicates unfortunately. Thank you though _AT_MENTION_ I just want to feel better already I hate feeling it I hate remembering it. _AT_MENTION_ thank you I appreciate this
176203889,I love your pics catch !!!
176203890,"No, ignore what that person said. I think you are just suffering with psychosis."
176203891,My virtual has been in porn industry since I was 7. What chi know about that? Anything interesting??
176203892,"_NAME_, I also thought this thread was about money"
176203893,Idk am I having delusions or not
176203894,that’s good advise
176203895,"_AT_MENTION_ it’s tough to say. Maybe from my glasses? Maybe my actual eyes? Maybe from something behind my ears? Perhaps my phone? I was afraid of my reflection for a long time because looking into my own eyes terrified me. Sometimes my delusion goes as far as thinking it’s an alternate reality that is viewing me, and not the one we’re in. Just, be careful, because it’s easy to get lost in this delusion. It feels so real…I hate the confusion. It’s not worth hurting oneself to find certainty on something that may not be real. As I slowly confronted my fear of looking into my eyes, which is still quite scary to me, I’ve become increasingly confident I’ve nothing to fear, though I’m still not convinced I’m not being watched."
176203896,"I mean, my life may only be prolonged, but I am certainly grateful I didn’t die of cancer at age 16. _AT_MENTION_ did you quit propranolol under a doctor’s guidance? Suddenly stopping and starting it can have a dangerous effect on your pulse."
176203897,Hello _AT_MENTION_ . I hope you’re doing ok.
176203898,I wish I would have had this book and meds 15 years ago… It looks like something they should hand out to sz patients as they leave the hospital.
176203899,Yes i was getting jealous for a second but once youre in it youre in it. Such a little country small population almost anyoner could be a tourist there. Almost for free.
176203900,"Have my appointment coming up in a few days, and I’m absolutely dreading going to her. I always leave her office feeling worse off than I came in, and I’m often glad when it’s over. There’s no compassion. I feel she only attempts to minimize my symptoms and disregards my suffering. I feel like I’m her customer, not her patient. That she doesn’t have an Idea of how to handle me. I’ve lost confidence and need to go somewhere else I think."
174394662,Amazing! Congratulations and best of luck to you! It’s good to hear stories like this…

174394652,Brain and Behaviour Research Foundation lecture - ‘Improving Functioning in Schizophrenia’ This video gives a few psychosocial tips that are good.
176203903,"Personally I feel that we are all united as one being and that I am a manifestation of the entire universe so naturally I feel that I am intimately connected with all of reality and not separate from it. As a result, I expect the entire universe to be “with” me and not just watching me. image900×696 387 KB _USER_ID_ Images _NAME_ and _NAME_ also discuss this topic and they reconcile eastern mysticism with western scientific methods. This podcast by _NAME_ helps me understand how the universe is all alive and that we are interconnected immortal spiritual beings having a human experience. This is known as _USER_ID_, the idea that all is conscious. Those are some rabbit holes to explore."
174394659,I don’t know why these studies say that. I can’t work and I can’t have a family because of schizophrenia. I think they are too positive and not realistic.
176203904,I’m sorry _USER_ID_. Maybe see a dermatologist and don’t try removing them yourself…
176203905,No never had _PERSON_ before.

176203907,Self-sufficiency is a great goal but you don’t have to be a 100% self-sufficient. You can work on being mostly self-sufficient and still lean on people when you need to and get help.

176203912,"Yes! _PERSON_ wasn’t bad looking, and he drove a BMW. He could have gotten a girl if he wanted one. I think what he really wanted was to hurt people."
176203913,There is no white lie as regards your relationship with your pdoc. You must be honest. No reason for lies
176203914,"They may they may not. Those things can also be caused by negative symptoms, which antidepressants do not treat. But if those things are being caused by depression, and if your depression is true mental illness depression and not just life related depression, they may help. There’s not really any harm in trying. I would not recommend wellbutrin for someone who gets psychosis (or mania) as it strongly influences dopamine which can trigger those things. I would recommend an SSRI to start such as prozac, zoloft, etc."
176203915,Would you mind telling us what your former user name was? I’m not making a connection.
176203916,"Thank you so much I really do hope it passes and I need to focus on myself. I’m questioning everything lately. Hopefully I can get out and go to a meeting soon and then I will go to rehab so that I can work on healing and recovery from all this. I try to be an inspiration to people not their downfall or a downer. So when I got crazy and posted so much I wonder if I am just hurting people that alone scares me. I tried deleting all my social media. I contacted the SZadmin to delete my account so Im wondering if I should. I don’t know that I triggered anyone on here, or at all I dont know. Its just that it always seems like my energy and vibes are reflected around others in person or online and Im afraid when I become manic I dont want anyone to take it the wrong way…"

176203918,I have high testosterone as a female and I’m asexual. I think testosterone increases sex drive usually supposedly? Therefore I think it’s not very black and white to answer that question.
176203919,"plus it wouldn’t probably be a ‘cure’, at most it’d be a ‘remission’."
176203920,"I want to try with you, what I thought was a thought experiment. It deals with _PERSON_’s quote that says: “the only reason for time is so that everything doesn’t happen at once.” I’m too cerebral but my question is ""Isn’t the concept of once still a portion of time? Taken another way: Are our examples of still photography, a capture of a finite and small piece of time? Or are our examples of still photographs, technically “moving pictures” just a teeny tiny bit?"
176203921,I feel like happy memories only hurt me when I’m having dark thoughts. Unless they are about my dogs because they are still alive.
176203922,"Yeah, that’s the smart thing to do. But I hear that new, deluxe riding mower calling my name."
176203923,"I’m 27, but I kept moping and sobbing about dying and I’m an atheist so I don’t think there is an after life. I assume that I will be gone for good. I know its not true necessarily. Our actions impact the world and create tangible changes that effect society. I just kept getting hung up on death and how traumatic dying might be, and how awful a send off that would be for having suffered through life. I had that completely go away when I went on depression medicine. A lot of this worry can be natural but sometimes its just an imbalance and it pushes you into a dark part of your head and where you are. I eventually tried to get off the depression medicine but I started randomly having crying bouts and stuff and eventually I decided that I needed to go back on it. I hope you give it at try or try a variety to see if you get a positive result. I know I had to go through a few before I found one that worked well for me. If your income is low enough in the U.S. a lot of this can be paid for by medi
caid or you can be on programs like “extra help” which vary between states."
176203924,"My new therapist is a licensed clinical social worker and she has worked and continues to work with severely ill psychiatric patients in a hospital setting. I spend about 40 minutes with her each session. So far I saw her once a week for five weeks. She immediately with lots of confidence and no hesitation diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder. My current psychiatrist has seen me for nearly 9 years, once a month for 15 minutes max each session. She is stumped as to my actual diagnosis but leans towards bipolar disorder with severe OCD. She recently diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder after I questioned the bipolar diagnosis. She told me that schizoaffective fits me as well. Go figure. In the meantime I’m on powerful antipsychotics and the only symptoms I’m experiencing are OCD symptoms and some paranoid ideation. I’m getting fed up with the whole mental health scene and how pathetic these disorders are diagnosed. Give me a ??????? break, please."
176203925,"but. if you realize that your cloth is weird, and your friend hates them, why are you doing that? I hate when my mom, that ill too and 60 years old, dressed up like a little girl. this is so embarrassing. but she is egoistic and has zero care about me. so why??"
176203926,I’m glad you are fine but do not advise people to take over the recommended dose of anything.
176203927,I think we are limited to the discourse options in the software package. Unless they add it we won’t be seeing it. I’m not sure where the stats are but someone will correct me.
176203928,I wonder whats better. Being off meds and be always in mental hospital or be on meds outside mental hospital feeling like crap 24/7.
174394665,"Vraylar is not available in Canada. Rexulti I don’t know, my pdr said there is a med like Abilify but it has the same side effects as Abilify so he won’t prescribe it."
176203929,I slept from 8pm to 3:30am I was kinda hoping it would knock me out for longer
176203930,Doh. I have a lot of those moments. For some dumb reason back when I was working I took my night meds in the morning. I got to work and figured it out when I fell asleep on the job. I somehow got home and wasted a day. Dumb but I’m sure most of us have done it.
176203931,I have really bad paranoia that comes at night only…
174394660,"Hi_PERSON_, are you asked to the practitioner if you can take 700 mgrs from two kits for an injection. 700 or another dose. Thanks, _NAME_"
176203932,I don’t even think it’s possible to get in as a new patient around me. I can only imagine how insincere a ‘skype’ visit is…
176203933,I’m not sure… I guess it could be bad if it were double the dose maybe
174394667,"The expensive one here looks like this, I was taking 20+5mg: unnamed512×512 31.6 KB"
176203934,Lol I’ll try my best not to relapse
176203935,Going to bed. Just took my meds. _NAME_’s sleeping beside me. Hope you have a good day/night.
176203936,"It really sucks to know you’re being taken advantage of, but not have the power to do anything to stop it."
176203937,"I am bored not suffering, there is a difference LOL"
176203938,I have not tried either but my mom has and It was something I didn’t remember what had happend

176203942,Easiest place to get young girls is in clubs. I once met two surgeons and I tried to date one of the two surgeons but it didn’t work out. I don’t know why maybe because I was younger than them 19 y.o. and haven’t finished my university degree yet.
176203943,Nonrandom mating refers to the people with sz or bipolar having children with people with the same or other mental illnesses.

176203946,"I was diagnosed with psychosis in the beginning and treated for psychosis for 9 years. Last year, though, I went to a new psychiatrist who said it was pseudo hallucinations, meaning I don’t think the voices are real. I wish that were true. I definitely think they’re real."
176203947,"I see my elderly mom every week or two, to deliver her groceries to her house. I’m filled with anxiety whenever I visit her at her house in case I bring COVID-19 cooties with me from the store. I don’t even hug her because I’m worried she might catch something from me, and I try and stay 6- ft away from her. When I had to drive her to the eye doctor last week, I wore a mask in the car because of the close environment. Maybe I’m just being excessively cautious. I don’t know."
176203948,I was always terrible at women’s faces. But after reading from an ebook with instructions. one was actually not terrible! It actually slightly resembled someone I knew years ago. Another I just did from a picture and— it was closer to terrible.
176203949,Do any of y’all have doctors that make you go once a month? This is annoying because I don’t have transportation
176203950,"I often wonder how much of the Matrix/_NAME_ show would be relevant if those shows weren’t so noticeable. It’s no surprise to me. Media affects our experience tremendously. From infancy on and sz usually makes that all that much more confusing. I like life. We all live with restrictions and such from culture, language and other concerns but I know it’s not a simulation. Nothing this strange would be artificial."

174394666,I love that song by _PERSON_
176203953,I have a big part of me always thinking I could have been more regular if I never developed symptoms. It’s like that part is in denial that I’ve been behaving strangely for so long.
176203954,This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
174394663,"I’m sorry you’re having such trouble. Abilify, Latuda, and Geodon are all less sedating medications you can talk to your doctor about. It’s a good idea to stay on some kind of antipsychotic for at least a year and a half, to give your brain time to heal from the damage of your psychotic episode. But talk to your doc about the side effects. You obviously still need to live your life."
176203955,It’s almost impossible to convince yourself it’s not real until you finally calm down. Panic can make us bad logical thinkers when addrenaline is rushing instinct takes over. Fight it flight. When we take meds we can sleep relax and wake up and realize…what was I thinking?
176203956,"Black ops already data mining everything they want/need computer/smartphone, etc. It would be the most stupid thing not to do it, since they aren’t in any books anyway. That’s what computer hackers do, they literally don’t need anyone’s permission. Question is how big of a fish are you."
176203957,"Welcome back, _AT_MENTION_ I missed you. Someone in your country claims he can cure cancer, Sz and aids? I don’t believe. If he claimed he can cure only one type of illness in stead of all of those three super tough illnesses, I would possibly believe his words."

176203959,"Sounds like you are going to have a really fulfilling job… exciting! Yeah, don’t take it personally if someone just cuts you off. I don’t think mine did, and if she did then that wasn’t my intention. Just wasn’t right for me, and I was going through a lot. Rather deal with that stuff on my own. Like how some people stop seeing therapists, it just happens."

174394668,"Oh well, I don’t mind getting cancer at 60y.o, I am 29. As long as it reduces my SZ symptoms."
176203960,I used to study full time and do a part time job before sz. Since sz studied part time and had tons of jobs that I didn’t last more than 9 months at. Its been a year I stopped work. I dont think I can work on my current meds unless I lower the dosage but then will have sz symptoms. I was on Abilify for the majority of the time that I studied and worked. I have a major bach. degree in kinesiology. I wanted to do master/specialization 1yr in physiotherapy but didn’t have the grades
176203961,"I didn’t mean to make you paranoid. All I meant was what a few other people said. Enjoy it while you can because no one is happy all the time except maybe the Beatles when they first became popular, lol. If things are going good just enjoy it. I found that even when my life seems to be going perfect, the reality is that I feel good, but things still go wrong, and I still have things about myself that I hate. Perfection is an illusion. A lot of people think that everything about their life sucks. That’s an illusion too. Life is usualy a mixture of good and bad but sometimes the good outweighs the bad. And the opposite is true too. I don’t know what that is and I can’t tell you if it will happen. I have no way of knowing. But I find that what we focus on and spend a lot of time worrying about tends to be a big part of our life. Maybe you have a specific fear that you think too much about and you build it up in your mind until that’s all you think about. The thing is, that it may never happe
n so focus on a good dinner or going to the park instead or buying new clothes or playing with the dog or cleaning the house or what you’re going to talk about at your next doctors appointment instead."
174394669,I’m afraid it’s going to turn out to be another dud antipsychotic.
176203962,My father was the same way. He was the biggest danger in our lives.
176203963,"_PERSON_ once said in an interview many years after the Beatles broke up that multiple times all four of them would go into the studio high off pot or LSD to record albums and singles. He said they laughed a lot and they all thought they had done brilliantly but the next day they would listen to it and _PERSON_ said it was all crap, none of it was ever good enough to make it on their records."
176203964,My sister is going to be here in an hour to help me clean up my place and I’m so embarrassed it is such an awful disaster. I am sitting here so nauseated. I hate feeling this way. I’m such a stupid waste of human space.

176203970,Seems like you have this issue almost always at this time in the morning(Is it morning where you are?).
176203971,Relax…I bet you smelled just fine. But that’s what our affliction can do. It takes a little something that should be pushed to the very back of our brain…in filing cabinet 1001…and brings it to the front of the brain as a number 1 priority. Going a day without showering is nothing. Keep enjoying your dancing and stop stewing about these piffles.

174394689,"Stop. One must prove cause and effect, for any acitivities and/or substances that one believes cured a particular disease. For example, if one believes his/her leukemia went away because s/he ate a navel orange every day for an entire year, s/he must prove that eating the navel orange actually cured the leukemia (and thus show it was not just a coincidence that his/her leukemia resolved during that same time). Even if there was proof that it did happen, it’s useless to the rest of the world if they actually copy what you did and don’t get the same result which means it wasn’t what you did but something else like spontaneous remission. These treatments only manage the symptoms, they don’t cure schizophrenia. And If you can remain symptom-free for another 5 years at a minimum, preferably 10, then we can start talking about being “cured” maybe."
176204007,"I have visual hallucinations but primarily auditory. Sometimes I just hear voices that sound like a bunch of people talking in another room. I can’t make out what they are saying but it’s hard to concentrate with all that background noise. I also hear _NAME_ and _NAME_, two adults that discuss and sometimes argue over music. I hear the music too. I hear a robotic sounding voice that narrates everything I’m doing. I also have a loud angry person that yells at me and says terrible things about me and what I should do to myself. This doesn’t happen very often, but I end up hospitalized pretty much every time it does. My meds keep a vast amount of my hallucinations at bay, but they still poke through 1 or 2 times a week. Besides medication, I rely on music alot to get me through them. I listen with headphones, and also play my bass along or solo. This helps my mind focus on something else."
176204008,"I think most might feel a difference after a couple of weeks up to a couple of months. It is usually very subtle though.

He said he spoke with the psychiatrist who referred me to the clinic and that once they are finished with me, I will only be under my original psychiatrist which is good because he knows me well.

176204031,"Yeah but I have never had such an anxiety/paranoia feeling as when I was on it. Everyone was in the mind that it was helping me, but I am naturally a very empathetic person. I don’t think it was, my emotions felt more blunted. I’m so confused. What’s normal anyways? I don’t know what my baseline is. I have never been that crazy as when I missed sleep/and a dose of medication. Then I doubled up on Abilify to counteract it thinking it would prevent me from getting worse, then I got worse anyways. And I was told not to take it and that the psychiatrist would call within a few days. I dont know if I trust something that’s gonna throw me off like that. I was hallucinating from lack of sleep, but the whole thing was caused by the anti-depressant: chest pains, sleep issues, coffee, weed, stress. And the fact I couldn’t tell what was making me get worse seems to be an issue. So I couldn’t get a clear answer and still haven’t gotten an answer about whether or not to continue Prozac. And the 
Prozac is already on its way to the dump. I threw it all out. If I can’t get a clear answer I’m not gonna bother with it; I had a bad reaction to Strattera which is an SNRI. Prozac is a SSRI. The SNRI made me hostile and angry. I got in a fight with my dad on it, and he almost attacked me. Everything is situational, other than the fact that these pills are making things worse anyways. Can’t smoke weed. What if it was Serotonin syndrome? I feel like all the people who are supposedly helping are making it worse. Like my addiction counselor said it was ok to smoke weed and went on tangents in IOP about Big Pharma using medications and Purdue and Drug companies. Then my psychiatrist agreed to put me on Prozac even though he says I have schizophrenia not a mood disorder. I don’t have schizoaffective or bipolar. Very very confused. No consistency here. I left rehab because they would’ve tried to get me hooked on suboxone or methadone even though I’m not an opiate addict, but they hand them out like cand
y. I’m just really frustrated. Sorry I offend everyone with what I say. I dont think people have my best interests anymore they just want me medicated."

Serious mental illness is the only disease where the doors to treatment are shut unless a crime is committed.

That’s a pointless game. Ideally you should find your meaning and esteem in the value you add to people’s lives, not in how much flash and flex you have. That seems wrong-hearted."

I don’t know if I’m really sad or relieved, as she was a Christian fundamentalist fanatic who really hurt our family, and that will taint her legacy big time for the remaining secular members of the family. What makes it a little worse for me is that she always said that I was her “favourite grandchild”. She at least lived a good long life anyway."
176204107,"I mean, if you’ve been psychotic and take APs, I’d say it’s ok for you to be here. My guess is that you’re on the way to a schizophrenia diagnosis, and that’s okay. But that’s just my opinion"

176204125,"I don’t know what sucks more, the frustration over going non-verbal, the fact that others take it as a personal choice aimed at them or the fact that when I snap out of it enough to verbalize my distress, I come across as needy, whiney and self-victimizing in an off-putting way which makes people reject me and/or become frustrated with me, which in return makes it even harder next time. A. If I’m in that state of mind if takes a lot of braining to make the words go at all. I don’t have enough brainjuice to adjust them to be socially acceptable too. B. I don’t want to be pitied or woed, but I also don’t want to sit there and pretend like I’m fine when I’m not. I’m having a really bad time, and the only way you can say going non-verbal was a choice for me is in the sense that the only other options are “cry uncontrollably” or “scream like you’re being murdered”. Does anyone else go non-verbal when things get to be too much? Got any tips for getting through it?"

176204132,No pornography is not a sin. I don’t like it but it’s ok for others. I have a friend who does porn and he loves it. He is into dressing in women’s clothing and s&m and shaming. He does porn because he loves the acts themselves and has a hard time finding partners who are into what he’s into.
176204133,I’m isolated and the people who try to enter my life just wants to use me for sex. It is lonely I get depressed alot especially around my period.

174394721,"Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant.

176204160,"To those who are concerned about the coronavirus, and if you have any delusions about the coronavirus and its relation to Koreans and Chinese peoples, I would like to talk about it. I’m now suspecting that no one will like me even on this forum because I’m Korean. Or because I’m Asian in general. People would hate me when I go abroad simply because I’m Asian. We have about 600 cases, and those cases were spread by a cult in Korea named Shincheonji. A member of this cult went about everywhere and refused testing. Now more than 200 cases are being added up. I’m suspecting that you guys won’t like me because I’m Korean. If you are worried that I will spread the virus by talking to you, that is not true. I’m merely a stranger on the Internet who’s just absolutely concerned about others, and who sees herself as a threat to everyone. You don’t have to like me if you are thinking: “Oh, she must be Korean so she’s just a virus.” I mean, I don’t know how I can clear this threat o
ff of foreigners, but it seems like people are hating on Koreans now. So you don’t have to like me anymore because I don’t like myself anymore. If I go abroad, no one would like me because I’m Korean and they would think I’m a virus. Maybe I’m just a virus. Who knows. I’m not loved by my home country, by foreigners, by anyone. I might be hated worldwide now. So I just want to say, if you have any delusions about the coronavirus I’m not going to make you infected. And no, I’m not infected and I’m not going out because of my compromised immune system. I’m sorry because I’m Korean/Asian and causing such a fuss in this community."

I started getting awkward out of highschool with lack of contact, and I felt very alienated when I got the last job because I was outside all day by my self pushing carts. I think over all that its hard to tell what was the disease and what was lack of practice, near the end there. Now I’ve gotten very friendly with people again online and through Dungeons & Dragons, but I still feel a little threatened because of my lack of physical fitness by aggressive people. The other day I signed up for the local Y so I’m gonna work on that through the winter. Hopefully getting moving will help me get out of this slump or at least identify a physiological problem that is outside the scope of schizophrenia and depression."

You can’t do that on the unemployment over here these days. Sux for younger people.
176204195,Therefore you should be ambivalent towards it. Don’t rule it out. I was a late starter but you only need to do it once and most things become redundant after that. Meds helped me get stable enough to have real relationships and that means some sex. It is a lot of fun and consensual sex is one of those things you can share with significant others in a really good and open way. Don’t give up and just get the mind right first is my advice.

Sometimes I don’t know if I can do that…if I can make it…how much I want to… I’m scared of letting go of one of my delusions, because it protects me from something very selfish. It tells me of punishment if I succumb to that temptation. In this delusion I’m not allowed to do it. If that delusion is taken away…and I’m left with just…”this”, I don’t know what I would do. I try to keep up hope, and prosperity, I fight so hard to, but I’m getting weary, and sometimes that scares me. Tired. Perchance some ennui. Off day. “In this picture stands a man, far away, alone, and distant, Like a solitary field in some nameless foreign land. All around him points of light start to dim, and cease transmitting.

Dromomania has also been referred to as travelling fugue.[citation needed] Non-clinically, the term has come to be used to describe a desire for frequent traveling or wanderlust. The term dromomania is derived[when?] from combining the Greek dromos, meaning ""running"" with the root mania.

176204250,"Today I met with my therapist. I told him that I’ve been writing a lot on my laptop about things in the past and how writing has conjured up new emotions and new perspectives and possibilities, just by virtue of writing. There’s no seance or voodoo magic to it, just typing on a keyboard and letting the mind go free, almost like a slightly different brain wave of consciousness - similar to being in the shower in the morning. Therapist asked if I would ever publish it and remarked that I had lived quite an eventful life. I told him never would I publish. First, I’m not wild about everybody knowing everything about me. Even using a pen name, a determined person or one familiar with my odyssey might be able to flush me out of anonymity. Second, it’s my belief that I drove my father to kill himself, and making money off his death seems wrong to me, practically blood money. People tell me that’s not the case and a child doesn’t have that power and blah blah, but I know me, and I know what I d
id and what my motives and aspirations were, so we’re not going to debate that here or anywhere else. Woah, sorry for going off the tracks. I’d vote no, keep your songs to yourself and family. It’s intimate and personal, and like it or not, if you put it on the web, it’ll be there forever. Some jackass may come across it and roll it into a mashup and totally humiliate you. Maybe I’m just guarded about personal grief, but I would not open that door to possibly let that walk through. My two cents."

If you take risperidone, you have to ask your neurologist/GP on how the pain medicine is going to affect your AP. When my pain level was extremely high, I had to take a high dose of opium. Realizing the risks of this, my geneticist told me to not take this, but take gabapentin instead. Communication with your GP is very important on this matter. CNS depression is scary!"

176204328,"I’m not a doctor but this is what the Nature study said: Mean peak dorsal striatal D2RO was 39% at 60 mg ITI-007 occurring 1 h post-dose. Lumateperone was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile in this study. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or clinical chemistry laboratory values, including prolactin levels. There were no adverse event reports of akathisia or other extrapyramidal motor side effects; mean scores on motor function scales indicated no motor disturbances with lumateperone treatment. This level of occupancy is lower than most other antipsychotic drugs at their efficacious doses and likely contributes to the favorable safety and tolerability profile of lumateperone with reduced risk for movement disorders and hyperprolactinemia. Reading down futher there is a chart that shows occupancy over a 24 hour period.It drops off to around 10% after 24 hours. Quetiapine is sold as Seroquel - it is one that has lower D2 occupancy than many others, but it 
has a short half life so at 24 hours post dose there’s not much occupancy of D2 either. Quetiapine I would say starts higher (than lumateperone) but rapidly diminishes in its D2 blocking vs lumateperone til they both end up at very low levels prior to the next dose."

The problem is that as soon I get to sleep I start having dreams and as soon as the dream finishes I wake up. This happens at least 10 times during night. I go back to sleep and wake up again over and over again. I’ve been taking Benadryl mixed with .5 mg of klonopin and it keeps my mind shut up for a few hours and then it starts all over again. I’ve tried 6 different medications and this is the combo that has worked the best and and even then it doesn’t work all the time. I also take Invega Sustenna 156mg injection and Wellbutrin 100mg. I don’t think it’s the side effects of these medications because when I first started to develop symptoms it started with Dream’s and me dealing with the same problem and it seems to be getting worse. The last few weeks I had been sleeping peacefully and all of a sudden it started happening again. I was hoping that with time this would go away just l

176204342,"Hello All, I’m new to this site. My 28 year old daughter is Developmentally Disabled. She is missing a chromosome. Because she is at the level of a 3 year old, she can’t really tell us what hurts or why she is upset. She did get up to approx. a 10 year old, but at the age of 18, she regressed to a 3 year level and got violent. Psyc docs continue to add med after med. I had to put her in a group home as I couldn’t handle her anymore. I never really classified her as Schizoprenic until she attacked me the day before Thanksgiving 2019 in the car as she said I was looking at her mean. She went to the hospital only for them to dope her up and send her home. On Christmas day 2019, she went to a new hospital after being violent at the group home. , we tried two things, at the same time, so we don’t know what worked. ECT and started Prolixin Shots. Her violence ended and we got our happy 3 year old back. However, when she gets her 2 week shot of Prolixin (5mg’s), she immediately stops eating, dri
nking and sleeping. She gets her shot on Fridays and yesterday (Tuesday), I was able to get her to eat a hamburger and drink water and Gaterade. Her resting heart rate was elevated as well, probably due to the dehydration. We did try Cogentin with the Prolixin shot the previous time, but she got violent again. She is so fragile to meds and we could have gave too much Cogentin. This time, she didn’t get violent, but just wouldn’t eat, drink or sleep. The med seems to work great for the next 8 days, but the first 4-5 are going to kill her. We want to give the shot as trying to crush meds in her food makes her refuse food.

176204359,"I have twice. And both times it was ladies I had incidences with. When I went to the hospital in Redding one older lady told me she went into the bathroom with a young man and he fingered her to climax. I thought it was massively inappropriate considering she was in there for saying she was going to kill herself because her man had died. I felt she was far too vulnerable to be in that situation and so I tattled to a nurse and the two of them were separated from then on out and she was talked to about it. She confronted me to see if I had tattled which I lied and denied, but she knew. Anyway, she was from Ukiah and I’ll be damned if she wasn’t standing in the pdocs office when I came out from my appointment. I looked and said you don’t remember me do you? And she walked right up to me and gave me a big _NAME_ hug. We exchanged phone numbers and talked awhile, but I never called her and she never called me. The other was when I when I went to the hospital in Woodland. She was also from my homet
own, the sister of my husband’s ex. She kept taking my things. She took my dirty panties. She was probably a size 4 and I was a size 12 at the time. I went to the nurses station and told the nurse that this woman took my dirty panties and the nurse said no one took your panties just as this lunatic comes walking out of her room with my panties on over her clothes. The nurse came out and rushed her back to her room to get me my panties back. It was probably a year later that we met at her nieces graduation ceremony and there was no sign that she even recognized me. If I didn’t know who she was I would have not known her, she was so normal."

174394773,"I still refuse to admit that I have schizophrenia, this is ridiculous for me, simply because I have never had any episode, I have never heard voices, never had any thoughts that a schizophrenic has. Ever since I started going to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with OCD and depression, once an antidepressant worked for me but it has stopped a few months later, then none of the SSRIs later on worked on me. So me and my doc started with antipsychotics for some reason, just to see how I react on them. I’ve taken like five different antipsychotics and all they ever did to me was making me sleepy and nothing else. So afterall I didn’t take any meds at all. One day my girlfriend wanted to commit suicide, so I said that if she does, then I’ll have to do the same (just to force her not to do anything). My mum heard what I said and called the ambulance, said that I’m suicidal, so they took me to the hospital. And I have literally no idea how they came up with a diagnosis saying that I’m schizophren
ic. Maybe it was because I told the psychologist that I find myself better or smarter than other people. But still, why should such thing be a determinant of whether or not I’m schizophrenic. When I left the hospital, I told about everything my psychiatrist and she simply laughed at the diagnosis, saying that it makes no sense and that I have a depression problem, not schizophrenia. I know you might still call me schizophrenic even though there is no such proof that I am one. But the question asked was how long it takes for Abilify _PERSON_ to clear out and if there are any people that went through the same thing as me that can share their experiences."

Exercise has made quite a big difference to me in managing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It’s taken me 6 months to get fit & my fitness is really important to me. I don’t know what ‘accommodations’ means. I’m in Melbourne, Australia. We don’t use that term in the workplace. Accommodation means where you live. I don’t disclose my mental illness to anyone because I don’t want to have to reassure any one that I’m not going to kill them due to _USER_ID_ about violence/homicidal maniacs etc. I just try to pass as normal. Every shift I hold my temper and smile and nod and let everyone know that I’m a nice person & a hard worker. Then I end my shift & go back to being tortured & anguished. I don’t think about my youth and the high end professional I once was. I am just grateful now to have the entry-level jobs I have.

After a while hubby asked is everything ok and I said yes. Initially I denied anything was wrong and brushed it aside, but soon told him I heard voices. He asked should I not get in at outpatients at hospital now and not wait anymore? (My pdoc referred me to state sector pdocs as he said my problems too complex for him to treat). I said not yet. I was reluctant to phone mental health social worker I used to see at hospital but I know it needs to be done. Turns out I started my period soon after so guessing the sza was worse with the pms."

174394789,"_NAME_-e is kind of equivalent to an antidepressant according to some published studies. also a psychiatrist named _NAME_ believed _NAME_-e would help someone with a certain type of schizophrenia but could worsen others. He studied 20,000 patients with schizophrenia and made the determination that they were a number of causes. One cause he called histadelia which he believed _NAME_-e would help. I personally believe I have this and have treated my schizophrenia successfully with _NAME_ and have been able to stop taking antipsychotics as they just slowed down my thought processes so it seemed like it was helping but it didn’t. Also he alleged someone with histadelia (elevates blood histamine and low dopamine and serotonin) could be helped with anti histamines in addition which is probably why antipsychotics provide some positive response in people with schizophrenia who may have histadelia. But as it lowers dopamine and sometimes serotonin too an antipsychotic may produce mixed responses. He has t
reated 100’s or 1000’s of people successfully with _NAME_ but as his studies were never controlled or repeated in the same way modern medicine likes to study things his approach has been criticised for this reason and it has never received mainstream acceptance. More studies would be needed but they have never been done accurately however one published study of 800mg _NAME_-e did show reduced aggression in people with schizophrenia. It’s really unclear if this is safe to take for schizophrenia or not so perhaps speak to your psychiatrist about it’s safety and ask if he will monitor you carefully if you have decided you are going to take this. Generally a psychiatrist may believe as long as antipsychotics are taken this could potentially replace or be an add on therapy if an antidepressant is already safely prescribed but always be careful with this supplement as some people who researched this have said it can make some types of schizophrenia worse however this is not proven at the same accepted level

176204461,It’s hard for me to enjoy life sometimes knowing one day I’ll die and worrying about what comes after.
176204462,"I’ll usually track my calories but not the foods I eat, if this makes sense."

176204466,I feel a bit less energetic but more lively on meds.
176204467,I had the same paranoia. Cops plant drugs in my house and arrest me
176204468,I’m a pretty laid back person but for something like cricket I’ll get up and all competitive. It’s totally not what I’d like to represent but I am competitive for certain endevours!
176204469,Ok I got my IUD out today and the weight loss is officially started! I am counting calories and plan on weighing myself daily. I have a little calendar I can put stickers on for when I meet my calorie goal that day. I also have it set up to where I can get myself little prizes and eventually a big prize when I reach bigger milestones. I walked I think 2 miles today on the treadmill and around my house and have huge blisters on my feet now and can barely walk so I dont think I’ll be able to workout tomorrow but I was proud of myself for doing so today. I also did not go over my calorie goal for the first time in ages. It was a great first day!!
176204470,"I don’t know, but if I am over medicated surely my psychiatrist will reduce some of the meds on Friday. I’ll have to tell him everything. Then he can decide what he wants to do with the meds."
176204471,Omg I just started these. I’ve got a lot of time in the hospital so I’m doing them.

176204477,You don’t need to decide in advance what is it that you want to talk about. That will happen over time. You can’t talk away bad genes but that’s only a relatively small part of the picture. There is plenty a good therapist can do even with psychotic disorder sufferers.
174394808,"You need to accept the fact that you will never be the same person as before psychosis regardless of meds. Yes psychosis reduced my intelligence by 70% but I am still happy and not suicidal with meds. Things happen in life, you’ll get worse if you keep thinking about the past. I wanted to be a Dr and had the grades but severe sz happened and I was never able to get good grades again with or without meds. See it as permanent brain damage."

176204482,"If you can get a lot of sympathy for being jealous, you might not realize that you are lazy and that people probably worked there butts off to get what they got."
176204483,why do you think that?
176204484,Just post here in 2 weeks reminding us.
176204485,but longer if I’m hearing voices or deluded at sometime during this
174394813,I have become aware this morning that there are some caregivers here who know a lot more than me about schizophrenia and they are working to treat the others here who are patients.
176204486,appreciated dear _AT_MENTION_ i was very anxious about this topic i even wanted doctor to stop them at any cost
176204487,My brother and Father believe that I should be on medications but they will sometimes downplay my symptoms at their convenience. It’s so frustrating.
176204488,Hello i flagged your post! I dont understand why do you want to talk and probably meet other people when it could trigger their beliefs more than they already have it especially if you know it a delusion ?
176204489,Welcome to the forum
176204490,I come from a great family. We never had much money but I had loads of emotional support.
176204491,You’re good with drawing expressions of faces. I’d love to be able to draw faces like how you do. I find faces the hardest part.
176204492,Hypothyroidism is also common. Psych meds can trigger this.
174394807,"I did a blood test and serum or something came back positive, Im sorry to say I have this for 20 years post Lyme syndrome neurological…"
176204493,"Yes. Over the past 2 months, she has come on here repeatedly with delusions that her mother is poisoning her/abusing her. Her definition of abuse is being forced to take antipsychotic medication against her will, and being admitted to the hospital when she gets overly hostile."
176204494,"Try to harness some of your brain to find a way to get peace and security. I hate what my brain does to me too, and I lucked out by coming to an assisted living center. Not everyone is so lucky."
176204495,I have noticed these effects too.

176204497,Sun is a star
176204498,"I engage with you because you give me a vehicle to “say things”, by this singling of me out, and putting the spotlight on me. I’ve paid a decidedly expensive ‘toll’ for mistakes made in BUSINESS. But I have a thick conscience and learned myself pretty good. Finally you make me feel like a ‘pretty girl’ in unsavory circumstances… perhaps because I like to talk, something you enjoy ‘wrecking’ for all. Why else would I deserve this parrying of compliments mixed with creepy throwaways and parting shots"
176204499,What else can we do? We’re not doctors and we don’t know the person. Hospitals are pretty much the only safe place if someone is having psychosis or suicidal thoughts.
174394800,"I am very slow socially, I think too much, in contrast my brothers are much more energetic socially and instant with strong emotions and emotional IQ. I suck compared to them. Asociality is a symptom of schizophrenia, part of negative symptoms. Anyways all my social contact now are my family. I dont hangout with any friend. Before sz I hanged out with tons of friends everyday like 20 friends and had 800 fb friends. I had two sets of friends I hanged out with and I was friends with the friends of my friends and of my brothers lol Sz totally destroyed me."
176204500,Maybe if they’re fighting over a bag of nacho chips.
176204501,My best friend is a dragon. I swear I met him in Ontario by the great lakes. There’s actually a legend about him “underwater panther” I did not know about the legend until I did a google search following the incident. I named him Moonshine.
176204502,Yes thanks _AT_MENTION_
176204503,They were happy that I will hangout with them soon.
176204504,"Just wondering, at what age did you get sz and at what age were you diagnosed?"
176204505,I have been feeling like that since getting sz. My brothers have a rich life but I don’t. I get jealous of them sometimes.

176204510,"My testosterone is in the normal range, but very low. It first tested clinically low. My doctor said insurance wouldn?t pay for it when it tested in the low normal range. They tested three times. I can?t afford treatment and there are risks with treatment I didn?t want to take, so I live with low T. I?m 60 years old by the way."
176204511,1 year and a month. The dreams are almost real.

My ability to resist food temptations is ridiculous on keto. I’ve made cheesecake and cookies for others and didn’t even consider trying them. I had a pinch to sample them and that was it."
174394810,"_AT_MENTION_ ,what’s new about yourself?What meds you take?Did you find girlfriend?"
176204513,Yes I do. And it makes me feel like I can’t function at all.

176204520,"that I am getting really weak in the legs. I can’t do some of my regular yoga poses anymore like Temple pose. I can only do that for a few seconds now and not minutes anymore. I do temple, squats, leg lifts and leg rise/holds and other yoga poses all very regularly but in spite of this, I’m still getting very weak in the legs. I spend a lot of time either sitting on my butt praying, reading, on my smartphone or desktop, playing piano, or watching TV. And if I’m not sitting, I’m reclining trying to rest off migraines (and that takes a LOT of time). What do you think guys and girls? What should I do?"
174394815,sorry for english
176204521,Does agree with this thread with what I typed?
176204522,"I struggle with motivation too. Shower once a week, don’t brush teeth or hair, house not so clean, haven’t painted in months and months… it’s so hard. I’m brilliant at procrastinating. It’s all too much effort. I just wait for a good day to come… they are few but they do come."
174394809,I couldn’t tell any difference when I took haldol. Of course I took the lowest mg. I hope abilify works for you better.

176204528,what do you wanna do later?
176204529,My combination seems to be working fine at the moment with no side effects. Sleep is still a big issue though.
176204530,"I’m so so sorry you feel terrible. Try to focus on the things that make you happy, memories, thoughts, jokes, experiences, something that will help you feel less suffocating, while you get help. You are strong. You can get through this."
176204531,Hit me out of the blue at 31 after a very stressful period.
176204532,"Yes, my antipsychotic meds help with the voices but not my unusual beliefs. I still believe there’s two spirits in my head and that my mother in law is going to harm me. Had these beliefs for several years now. A psychologist I saw once told me that my belief that my mother in law is going to harm me is normal. I never went back to her again. I mean, it’s normal for me, but I know it’s not normal for everyone!"
176204533,"March 3, 2021 I don’t know if I told you, last year I had a bad fall. I had felt the psychic draft in that spot for sometime, and now I’ve fallen. I don’t think the psychic draft is still there. At first. I thought maybe I’d died. So I took a scan, and could see that I was still alive. Then, I wondered if I had broken anything. So I took another look, and I could see that nothing was broken. Therefore, I crawled up the stairs and got in bed and went to sleep. It hurt a lot, but I’m done with that now. It remains to be seen if I’ve suffered brain damage. Celebrate all the things one gets to find out about oneself through this kind of experience! Yours, _PERSON_"
176204534,"_PERSON_ it could be worse, I am not treatment resistent, I have no positive symptoms."
176204535,I think we all lose/lost our minds a few times in our lives. Hang in there _AT_MENTION_
176204537,"Well I don’t know what your aptitude is in a lot of things, but I know a lot of schizophrenics enjoy computer related work. There’s a lot of IT careers like computer support that you can often work at home if it’s available in your area. Then there’s the more programming side of computer jobs. Like coding and software development. Just some food for thought."
176204538,Severe negative and cognitive symptoms but I can’t be alive without my meds. I become a danger to others and to myself without my meds.
176204539,"Ive personally watched my followers on facebook go from “what a train wreck of a human being” and “what a lost cause” to “oh wow, Ninjastar you are an inspiration to us all” and “I am so proud of my friend” and those comments all make me equally sick. I do not try as hard as I try to appease and get approval of people who gave up on me and were ready to throw me out 7 years ago. I do what I do so others like me know that they can do it too. I do what I do so if there is another lost and confused person out there struggling with psychosis, they see me and others like me and realize they can have a life that makes them happy,whatever that life looks like."
176204540,Gene I once met with a preist to tell him that I was angry with the Lord for my disease. His response was that everyone has a cross to bear. It took quite a few months to realize what he meant. I think the best way to accept this is by the way in which you choose to live. Its something that can only be expressed by actions not words or thoughts
176204541,The internet says all ssri for ocd but not sure if even true
176204542,I think it’d be freeing to the point It’d be helpful a bit.

174394818,Both medicines causes high prolactin. My prolactin is 70ng/ml on amisulpride 150mg. And 30ng/ml on just risperidone 1mg. 1mg risperidone doesnt work for psychosis. Maybe i need 2-3mg. Plus there is risperidone induced ocd. I’m already reducing clozapine cuz of high ocd on it. What should i do ? Im so confused. If i could reduce prolactin on amisulpride. I might stay on it.
176204546,Always say “see a psychiatrist” though.

176204551,And do you think homeless people have the luxury of staying in bed? No they on are street corners begging for change. It would teach you a miserable lesson to have to do it.
174394817,Maybe alcohol isn’t for u. When I drank alcohol it was like I found my magic elixir right away and it was gonna save my life. I ended up an alcoholic anyways so it wasn’t so great. Happy to say I quit.
176204552,"Woke up well rested. Played a video game for a little bit. Went to the bathroom and had a normal bowel movement. Took a freezing cold shower, cleaned up, put on some nice clothes and was smelling good. Got some food ready. Went to work."

176204561,"Well last time I tried coffee years ago, I became paranoid. Since then i did not touch coffee I might try again and see if I can tolerate it now. Caffeine is stimulant which has chances of increasing postivie symptoms in some people."

176204564,"Like a lot of you, I feel like I’m medium functioning. I don’t really do a lot but I feel like I’m capable of more than I actually do. I was working almost full-time in fast food from January to August of this year but quit because I clearly wasn’t handling it well towards the end. I hope for a less stressful job that can actually remain part-time as I see it (two or three shifts of varying lengths a week)."
174394822,For future generations and kids. This is a devastating illness. I would be pissed if I didn’t have schizophrenia because I’d feel very weak. I got something though.

176204566,"My family doctor wanted me to discuss my prolactin levels with my psychiatrist. According to my recent blood test my prolactin levels went up a bit, from about 25 to now 31. Do you guys know what your prolactin levels are? Is 31 or 32 a high number? Do you think my pdoc will take action over these numbers?"
176204567,Well if they’re not causing you distress then That’s something. Those beliefs are way out there though. Were you ever on a med whereby you didn’t believe these things ?
176204568,"You have the opposite of munchausen and your doctor knows it. You keep trying to STOP your treatment and he keeps refusing. If he thought you were faking, he wouldn’t be so hesitant to reduce your meds."

176204571,About 3 weeks ago. I was a mess
176204572,I dont get nicotine so my voices block it and say that they disconnected brain tissue so I think that when I do stop things will get better

176204588,clozapine is only good at low doses. At medium and high doses its very bad in terms of side effects. Weight gain is also seen at low doses. But sedation is less at low doses.

176204597,"I had to switch APs each time I got bad side effects, eventually I landed on Zyprexa which doesn’t give me any at 7.5mg."
176204598,_AT_MENTION_ I paid my bills and immediately made my budget for the next month just to show myself I had no money to spare. Trying to pay stuff off is hard.
176204599,“play the guitar really loudly and in a chaotic way” So I did. I don’t expect reward from my actions. I do it without any hidden motive. I just act as they say
176204600,Have you noticed it with things that are just bread? Could it have been the cheese? Or high fat content? There’s a lot in pizza that could cause pain.
174394826,"_AT_MENTION_ , yeah it is horrible, thanks for your understanding. I appreciate it as I’m suffering a lot at the moment. I’ve got an appointment to review my ap’s next Tues, may go back to Zyprexa to get some relief. I’m glad Abilify is helpful for you. It is hard to explain symptoms to pdocs. Out of desperation, I _NAME_ detailed pictures & my pdoc still didn’t understand. It’s no wonder the frustration of being misunderstood triggered endless imaginary conversations in my head. If your pdoc understood you do you think your mental conversations would stop, or would it just change topic?"
176204601,My team likes to know what I see and hear to understand how I’m doing and to refute my beliefs since I don’t agree that I’m hallucinating. Maybe yours are trying to gauge where you’re at but they lack the skills to say it so you’re not immediately put off by it
176204602,Had a stool test done when i was in ICU with malnutrition. Had the obligatory finger up the bum as well. They were testing for colon cancer. It wasnt - i just caught a vomiting bug from the previous 2 months and was street homeless - hence the weight loss. Didnt stop me ripping out the tubes from my neck and hobbling to the taxi rank 4 days later tho. I have to be absolutley incapable before i stay in a hospital.
176204603,Those are some fine potatoes
176204604,"When I had my first episode at 17, they kept me on AP’s until I was 19. I was fine for a couple of years, but started to deteriorate again by 22. Been back on meds since I was 23 now, so it’s been 10 years. I have always been on the maximum dose except for Haloperidol - that drug was just spiteful for me side effects wise and came off it thankfully. I tried it again as PRN about a year ago, and whilst very effective it brought back a lot of my movement problems."

I’m not anybody else’s mental projection, that’s sociopathic insanity. Not sure if this is a solipsism thread but if you truly believe in solipsism then what’s to stop you from going on a criminal rampage? I mean there’s no consequences because everybody’s an illusion so do whatever you want, it’s not like others are going to suffer or something. This is a delusion I had and recovered from. It put me in jail and destroyed many of my possessions. I suggest anybody feeling this way seek immediate and serious treatment."
176204607,I have mixed feelings. Before my diagnosis my life was going way off track. Now it’s back on “track”. So old photos don’t exactly fill me with nostalgia.
176204608,"i’ve gotten comfortable. i haven’t been challenging myself to learn new things for the last 5 years. so im thinking i need to start challenging myself to learn again. i plan on a couple hours of academic study each day, but that is not all. also i need to learn hands on things, like home maintenance , maybe a bit of mechanics. and also i need to keep learning about hobbies like guitar and gardening, as well as fitness tips. otherwise, i will be less than my best. im sure i will find my limitations eventually and will end up specializing in my strengths when that happens. maybe i can achieve something with this illness?"
176204609,how long till they take you there? I hope you will get some help there.
176204610,"Agreed, been there with ya. Thing is, we (addicts) pushed them to that point and the onus is on us to earn the trust back. It’s one of those time takes time things. Just keep doing what you’re doing and things will sort themselves out."
174394841,"I counted calories for a week or so, just to get an idea of what 2000 calories looks like and how hungry I felt on it. Then I just eat roughly that much. On amisulparide I had to keep myself a little hungry or else I would put on weight. I changed to Abilify and my appetite went down, now I can eat like normally and not feel hungry all the time. I have been obsessed with the scales though. But I’ve learnt that they are pretty random and not take much notice of fluctuations - it’s just so I notice if I’m putting on substantial weight. I have put on heaps of weight in the past and not been aware of it. If you’ve got an idea what your calorie goal looks like in portion sizes, then there is no need to constantly count them - your right, it can lead to obsession, go easy on yourself."
176204611,How long have you been clean with these drugs?
175155123,"same, i’m also going to wait a bit. The vaccine i might be willing to take still but when they start with implants to store if you been vaccinated and when, then I will pass for sure."
176204612,yes they were part of the ingredients of triggering the psychotic episode a few times.
176204613,"I’m actually under the impression that he’s lying about me. So like put yourself in my situation: I moved home in good conscience because my life was unmanageable. But I never believed I had schizophrenia. Now I’m in this situation where I could get benefits for my schizophrenia (although I applied for SSI as Bipolar) so I don’t even know which one they’re gonna call me, would it be wrong to allow the government to give you money for something you don’t believe is true? Like it’s almost like bribery. I’m in a financial prison where I have no income, and family refuses to support me event though they can. But I have to get SSI and in order to get gov. benefits I have to agree that I have some mental illness which I don’t believe I have, and then they get to control how much money I have. That’s just more control. And I will be capped at $2000 in my bank account, so I won’t be able to fly around Paris or anything. So not only mental slavery but financial slavery. If I say no to 
the hearing and don’t get SSI, I could still qualify for stimulus checks. Either way, I’m being punished for this label. And I believe the psychiatric system caused my illness through malpractice. As I went in at 15 for a suicide attempt induced by anti-psychotics after I was raped in boarding school, then I was assaulted in the mental hospital and given tons of experimental treatments for 9 weeks or more, and isolated as punishment for refusing medications. So in my mind, the system caused my illness because that was before I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. BEFORE."
174394831,A friend i believe it was _AT_MENTION_ or _AT_MENTION_ (correct me if I’m wrong) who told me NAC decreased abilify AP effect and he or her is right it might also be doing that with the minocycline… I have little to no effect… it used to work like a charm always
176204614,"I had taken mod alert but later stopped due to headaches, by the way my psychiatrist never said or talked much. I presumed that it was not my thinking gone wrong but just imbalance which cause wrong thoughts. If you find the right meds you will get back as usual, but one think I learnt never doubt. By the way its just me."
176204615,And I wonder if it’s me getting my period soon. As I tend to get like this during those times. It feels like I’m paranoid but I’m not just the anxiety.

176204636,"I used to have that. When I stopped believing that you could somehow communicate in your head I stopped hearing things and that delusion went away.

176204640,"The idea that some sort of creator with a personality existing, IDK,but… the one thing that makes me think maybe this is true is that we have personalities ourselves so however we came into existence the source of that, the ‘designer’ would they not have to have a personality too? and whether he is evil or good…well there is all sorts of positive and negative things in the world not just negative or not just positive. I always remember someone once saying that ‘God’ is a God who is always growing and hence the mixture of positive and negative. I try not to believe in a God, because it makes me feel uncomfortable. but the argument that the designer of the universe must have a personality due to us, the creation , having personality does intrigue me… sorry if i mention obvious things i am a slow human lol"

I didn’t react. She went out back to where my ex, her stepdad was and began to tell him that I stole money from her and dry humped her boyfriend at the casino.

176204670,"I remember now what scared me into getting clean The court back in 2005 wanted to send me to a rehab place called Narcanon - which was run by Scientology, and you stay until you finish. Went there to visit for a tour, and it literally was weird as hell. I looked it up and really did not like the idea of it. They do not recommend them to people now I think. Luckily this scared me into finding another solution, which was continuing with my drugs counsellor in the community for a 12 month period. Since then I have had about 5 relapses and the last was 10 years ago when I spent £1,000 on Cocaine withdrawing money from my credit card. Now I think about it more today, I don’t want any of that hassle. I got into a lot of trouble with the law as a teenager, and now I am an adult I am guessing the punishment will be harsher I don’t know. It’s all a bit of a mess at the moment.

It’s pretty easy to do and I can take my time making it. Also for a night snack I have been having a small bowl of defrosted frozen berries. I text and email people quite a bit but hopefully don’t annoy them too much. My cat crawls up next to me every night for a tummy rub. I stretch a lot.

174394844,"Before IX 2014 I had small numbers of coincidences, maybe one for six months , I had rather only two “symptoms” which may be seen as ideas or delusions of reference - first associated with evening 31.8.1997, when I rode a bike with my mother almost in darkness and something suddenly and very loudly fell from heaven (meteorite?), it might fall close to me, we probably were frightened. Next day - 1.9.1997 - was my first day in school. I might think that it is sign from heaven which means that I will, for example, do something great about school. Another “idea of reference” was associated with car accidents near my home and field of our family. There were two road accidents which looked pretty dangerous but people not only did not die, but also were not wounded! I might think that it was my influence which protected people from serious consequences of accidents. When I read description of paranoia in certain Polish webpage I thought that it is in some way really similar to my coincidences. The 
description is: Paranoia is a delusional syndrome which is lasting (Polish: trwa?y), orderly (Polish: uporz?dkowany) and strictly conceptual (Polish: ?ci?le poj?ciowy), in which symptoms last continually some years, are unchanged and very logical . It appear to fit to my case very well My coincidences were amazing for me just in September 2014, when they not lasted some years or even months… I had wild stims because of excitement associated with these phenomena, I remember them from 22.9.2014… That day I had coincidences due to looking at the teletext and hearing or watching a programme about facts in TV. It was the very beginning of that fascinating phenomenon. But I do not think that my coincidences are paranoia, delusions or symptom of schizophrenia. I even do not think that they are symptoms of schizotypal disorder, like ideas of reference. I may think that I will be great apostle of Almighty who changes entire world to make it much better place. I rather think that they are small miracles in which Go
d chooses to remain anonymous or quite complex tricks of unclean spirits."
176204683,I’m glad this site has been helping you. Also I hope your psychiatrist appointment goes well.
176204684,I blurt things out sometimes. It feels like turrets. I will say really inappropriate things. I repeat things that I hear a lot also. I think I am going to increase my latuda again soon I will be on the max dose. The last increase improved my symptoms.
176204685,Do you mean scraping insides of the peel? You can probably can get away with that. Otherwise I think it’s absolutely unhygienic to eat outside of the peel. I’d probably look for some other source of those minerals

176204687,I kind of figured that out. Is this why you were so angry at them? I’m sure you won’t go to jail. Stealing from your family is the worst though. They are your family. You shouldn’t steal from family. But I know you are sorry. I’m glad you are sorry. I hope you don’t do that again. Then you really will get in trouble.
176204688,"Hey everyone, So _PERSON_ done the initial 30 treatments. Overall, my mood has improved i no longer seem to be getting suicidal thoughts or have a grim view on life, my tolerance to stress is higher, I am less irritable, it seems my thinking is more positive. I can focus more easily on tasks, and I seem to remember things a bit better (possibly due to depression lifting and having focus/concentration come back). Was it a miracle treatment? Id have to say not really as I still have pretty decent fatigue and my lack of motivation/avolition still lurks. Id say I am more on the avolition side of things now as I have more interest in learning new things again and doing activities, but the fatigue can hold me back. I will be meeting with the psychiatrist on monday to follow up and setup maintenance treatments I believe at 2 times a week for the next 4 months. I am meeting with my other psychiatrist next friday to further discuss the trial of modafinil for the fatigue/excessive sleepiness. That gives abou
t 2 weeks break from the rtms treatments to rule out if thats where more fatigue is coming from. Ive struggled with the fatigue/excessive sleepiness for many many years though and my other pdoc thinks its just part of the illness. One of my thoughts about my avolition is that some of it right now may stem from fear of trying again only to once again fail because of setbacks from my mental health plummeting. So I am going to work on changing that thought process through baby steps. All in all I am now hopeful for the future, and before I was feeling pretty dang hopeless. cheers, Level"

174394856,"Dude, these things happened after a year and I half. If I had a year break with no negative symptoms(My situations weird, I will feel alot of the effect of the antipsychotic for months even after I discontinue it.) and without Cops constantly wanting me to go to the hospital(despite clear and concise conversation and no SI or HI), then I would pay for it. Going for over a year and half while being under control is impressive, and I would(I know some people are going to be against it, but who wants to feel like **** with nothing happening in their life) emotionally recommend maybe just taking a cut and maybe just waiting until a certain point before you take meds again. Just rinse and repeat and before you know it, you’ll have saved years of your life that you lived instead of just laying down, vaping and staring at the ceiling(what you said). There has to be a cooldown time(which has been proved before) from when you stop taking meds to when your symptoms start becoming unmanageable. I think that
’s awesome that you managed to go to school and (from what it seems like) finished at least a semester or two. You were going full time and basically doing better than 80% of people by getting A’s. There is medicine(Propanolol for example) that can help you deal with akathesia from Latuda. The fact that you took Latuda while nauseous is kind of impressive, but they have medicine(such a Zofran) that will help combat it. Was feeling nausea everyday worse than feeling negative(bored) symptoms of SZ? It’s honestly about what makes you feel good and progressive. I would’ve traded negative symptoms for nausea any day when I was suffering. Did you know what Wellbutrin was when you were prescribed? I don’t blindly trust my doctor too much and just take what he gives me without looking up it first. But that’s just me. The wellbutrin could have been a good thing for you, but it looks like it didn’t help at all, so at least you saved sometime by knowing that. Also, when you had difficulty falling asleep, t
hat is perfectly treatable as well, as theres at least 10 medicines that could help you do that. So I basically have everything covered, and it seems like the worst symptom(if untreatable, but very unlikely that it is) is Nausea. That really is impressive that you worked while on Latuda for 10 months. I believe in the cause and the effect for evidence that something can happen. If you were perfectly happy, OR AT LEAST better off dealing with those symptoms for that long then you’re probably going to be better off anyway with Latuda. Side effects suck, but if you actually felt like doing things(which is actually what matters), and/or you enjoyed them(I’m sure you did to some degree) while dealing with the perfectly treatable side effects, then I think you’re better off with the latuda direction if you want a functioning med. Positive symptoms are managable as long as their not too bad. They’re even more managable if you practice resilience(there is no limit to how much or how often you do this) as long 
as you don’t get too tired doing so. But hey, I would rather be tired, than bored anyday. Also, you could practice some cognitive behavoral therapy(this is doable even without a therapist) which is basically replacing bad thoughts with good manageable ones(Ex: You’re hearing hallucinations, but it’s not too bad[perspective], or this soon shall pass. But it seems like you can deal with the positive symptoms to point until you become violent, which is impressive. Honestly, what I said before seems like a good plan, and this is way better than being bored and spending 90% of your time in bed. If you were actually enjoying things(which people tend to really take for granted until they lose that ability, AND progressing through life to the point you were doing too good at university(I would absolutely push myself on this, but by somehow testing out of as many courses as possible and maybe taking a Huge courseload.), then I strongly think that you could get away without taking meds for a decent amount of time
. After all, this is your experience, and you could even experiment with taking smaller doses to get rid of returning symptoms and to buy yourself some time. If you had a little bit of positive symptoms come back after a year, you could cut up your 4mg Risperdal tablets into 1mg and then they’ll likely go away. This could last you until probably 2 years, or forever(too be honest). By then, you’ll have completed your Masters Degree, and you’ll be even more set to go. If things get too bad, take a reduced course load or just take a semester off while you’re medding back up. Just go back to your 4mg Risperdal. You could do this during the summer break and be perfectly fine until the next one or the one after that. This is a win/win situation and you’ll always be good when you have to be productive. Honestly, I’d rather go to school 5 days a week and be feeling good anyway, than stay completely medded up, bored and no doing much all the time."

176204754,"Yeah writing is pretty tough. It’s always best to make an outline… It’s almost like the best way to write is to make an outline, then review it, then go back to just pondering and adding more depth, then repeating that process until the outline is so developed that it is basically the piece of work itself. If someone is going to write something they should be prepared to rewrite and reread porbably at least 10 to 15 times. The outline serves as the central hub. It allows each writing session to have an immediate goal, while facilitating the likelihood of it all fitting together. Also doing small bios of each character and their history can assure each one has been given a persona and depth."

176204829,I dont work I have my mama that helps me get past this
176204830,"The one I’m always writing about. Two days ago it was about 9:00 pm and I heard someone outside my front door sobbing and sobbing. I was going outside but then I heard the women neighbors come outside and I could hear them trying to calm the woman down. From what I heard, I just assumed that the woman was crying because her boyfriend had hit her or broken up with her. This went on for awhile but I opened the door a couple times to look outside and nobody said anything to me so I gathered they did not need any help from me. Then I heard several people walking around upstairs above me. Anyways, I saw the counselor for this building parked outside and the neighbor had been particularly mean this past week and I had pounded on the walls or the door, so when the counselor came I thought for sure she came to warn me that was against the lease. She knocked on my door and I was all ready to defend myself but she told me that the guy upstairs had died and all those footsteps were the police… I was in sh
ock. It was one of those weird things that happen, and it especially hit home because he was younger than me. The crying was his mother and father. The counselor came in and I was all worked up, and we talked somberly but for a split second I smiled and she saw it. I couldn’t help it, I was happy for that brief second that the sadistic torture was finally over. But I composed myself and acted appropriately. But the worst part of it was that this counselor wanted to believe that everybody in the building got along and everybody was nice, which is so far from the truth. So when the counselor told me I could talk to her so she could “help me grieve through this difficult time”. I said OK, but in reality I saw little to grieve about except for the poor parents losing a son. I feel bad for them and I hope the guy died painlessly and quickly without suffering. Anyways, I’m not going to bad mouth the dead except to say he changed my life forever in a seriously negative way."
176204831,I don’t know why but I never found myself wanting to become a psychiatrist… maybe its because I can’t deal with these type of jobs.
176204832,Ok but what can I do?
176204833,"I’m really not attractive or successful enough to be picky, or look for something in someone else. I’d probably just be happy with whomever as long as we got along."
176204834,Looks like someone bending over and puking out the letter r
176204835,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_. That’s tough. I go through periods where I can’t sleep and that alone is hard to deal with. It’s so exhausting mentally and emotionally.
176204836,"i have succumb to my desire…I had stopped smoking and e-cig for a month, only a little puff or there…I thought I could stop this, I still think I can…but today I smoked two-three puff right after I wake up. I don’t feel like smoking as gaming is already a bad habit I’ve got, it will be very disgusting to have two bad habit together. Some people smoke but do not game, some people like me game, but do not smoke…isn’t this fairer?I am going to play games whenever I feel like smoking…to me…both is not good lol"

176204839,I’m having really bad tooth pain right now. Have any advice to ease the pain?
176204840,My best friend has BPD. I could see her doing this out of fear of abandonment. Just stay calm to ride her highs and lows. BPD comes with black and white thinking so people with it think things are all good or all bad. That’s why she got so upset she needs the hospital. Right now to her it’s all bad. Hopefully she can get the help she needs as BPD is actually treatable to the point that people no longer have it.
176204841,"It’s a weird phenomenon to try and explain whether or not a person’s self changes, I completely lost my self with sz, but I get tiny moments where I remember how I once was, bits of me shine through this flat face mask. I would not say I’m the same, I got on a derailed roller coaster ride to a detour through a wasteland lol."
176204842,"well done, hope they have some interesting work to offer you. let us know how you go."
176204843,very nice =) 151515
176204844,yea i get like that about my dad sometimes… i know he will never do anything to me but yet sometimes i get the feeling he will suddenly walk again and do something to me at night.
176204845,sorry led. don’t have tech savviness. _NAME_
176204846,"So, should I worry or not"
176204847,"Yes, I made peace with my illness a long time ago… I worry a lot about my future and what my care will look like though. Kind of scary."
176204848,"That sounds horrible! I, too, suffer with voices from time to time, but my symptoms are mostly visual. When I do deal with voices, they’d tell me I’m going to hell and that my friends and family can’t stand me and to just kill myself. There were other things they’d say too. What helped me overcome it is that I just happen to be very familiar with bible scriptures. Things the voices would say wouldn’t even line up with what scriptures say. Once I got a handle on what was really going on, I realized the voices themselves were harmless as long as I didn’t listen and harm myself. I tried to just imagine them as demons telling me lies and trying to break my spirit. I got rebellious and told them, “If you are going to try to quote scriptures, get your facts right you dumba$$”. For me, it was helpful to assign them as demons trying to hurt me because it helped me be strong and know everything they were saying were lies. Regardless if we are creating the voices ourselves, it’s like the vo
ices’ entire goal is to break us down, so we need to consciously be aware of that. When they see that it is working, it just continues. I was lucky that when I rebelled and called their bluff every time they opened their mouth, they started leaving me alone for longer periods of time. Sometimes months go by before they come back. But giving them an assigned identity helped me. I chose demons because it goes in line with my visual hallucinations, so that may not work for everyone. The goal is to assign someone/something whose mission would be to hurt you with LIES. But it is “very important” that you still know the distinction that you are only “assigning” it as them (almost like a role playing exercise) and know it’s not really whoever you decide to assign to it in reality. When I tried to look at it as it’s just my own mind, it didn’t have the same affect when trying to rebel against it. I needed an external source to assign it to. Not sure it’ll work for everyone, so you may or may not fin
d this helpful."

176204852,Not really but I see my pdoc on Monday
176204853,You sound like you need to go to the hospital. How are you holding down your job with all those symptoms?
176204854,"_NAME_ died by walking out in front of a car on the interstate he wanted to die, he was suicidal. You don’t appear to be, but it seems like an early sign."
176204855,"Yeah, that’s true. Some people do swear. It’s just not as common as people think, and there are other, much more common symptoms."
174394880,"I get the Sustenna Invega - 156mg monthly injection and it has helped a lot. I don’t hallucinate, I’m not delusional anymore, voices are like whispers, I have insight into my illness, my mind has stabilized a lot, I’m firmly grounded in reality, I keep up with my hygiene, listen to audiobooks, podcasts, socialise when I get a chance, talk to friends, work as a cashier, dress nice and smell good everyday and basically try to stay active and busy. I was going to the gym 3 - 4 days out of the week and though it’s supposed to be good for you it was having the opposite effect. My mind was racing all the time, I was really amped up and having a hard to with my sleep. Since I’ve stopped going my energy levels are a lot more stable, and I’ve been sleeping better. I also get the lumps because of the injections but I just switch arms every month and the lumps eventually go away with time. I also have sexual dysfunction, low libido, no desire for sex, I was dealing with severe constipation but I s
tarted taking docusate sodium and it has helped tremendously with that problem. It was so bad that I started getting blood in my stool and went for a colonoscopy and everything to get checked out and they said it was internal hemorrhoids. Regardless I’ve resolved that problem. These are the only side effects that I’ve been dealing with and maybe high prolactin levels and slightly high cholesterol. My positive symptoms are virtually all gone and Wellbutrin - 100mg managed my negative symptoms very well. I’m as close to normal as you could possibly get but I still have my bad days which are getting less and less. I haven’t gained any serious weight and am in a healthy weight range. I’m slim and fit into my clothes well. Besides the side effects this drug had controlled my symptoms very well and hopefully with time things will only improve. I’ve been on this injection for almost a year and a half and am very stable. Hopefully this helps!! Good luck with everything and all I can tell you is to hang in 
there."

I was afraid of talking even to my siblings. I couldn’t get out of my bed. I felt as if I was bearing a bag full of rocks on my back. I had no emotions and barely could smile or cry. I felt empty and thinking about suicide too much. After 2 years, I got better and I can talk to people and make friends. I can go out to nightclubs with my friends and participate in work projects. I’m energetic (still lazy) and I can cook my own food and do physical exercises. I still have some depression but it’s another story."

People like me but I’m not famous in reality . It’s not good to be psychotic but I’m asking if anyone ever gets like that. I get totally embarrassed I’ve ran for president so many times I felt unstoppable then bam it all comes crashing down and I’m just a regular guy again

176204868,"I’m working most of the week. I feel lethargic. I sleep, eat, and work a little. It is a routine I adapted to survive. I want to do more with my life. I’m old and want to fade away. But, I must survive so I have to work. I earn a pittance. I could be angry but feel grateful for my existence. I used to be homeless and sleep on benches. I met others like myself who were down and out on their luck. I met druggies, prostitutes, abused women, pimps, and scammers. I was blessed to have gotten out with nothing but the clothes on my back. I feel bad sometimes about my situation, how I have gone to- the valleys of the shadow of death-returning alive but incoherent. Why is this my fate? So, I don’t complain. I feel grateful. I wish there was a money tree. I work, slave away to eat and survive. I could be angry. I’m too tired though. What the heck! Such a life, wasted by illness, destroyed by insanity, and enfeebled with age now. Yes, I could be mad and curse God. Oh well, I’m resigned to my fate. I 
accept my life. What else can I do?"

176204893,My Mom was a narcissist. It was difficult living in her world sometimes. But I’m pretty easy to get along with so it worked out.

Four months ago I was lying on the floor with a knife and trying to cut - and today I am eager to get out of bed. So know that it always passes. As my sister sometimes says - ride the wave. In the meantime whilst you wait for it to pass, the best thing to do would be to engage in simple pleasures (even if they don’t have the same pleasure they used to) and have someone around to talk to (or a pet even). Distraction helps a lot! Read, pray, paint, listen to music, watch a comedy or take a walk or cycle etc. Exercise is a good way to feel better."
176204895,"PubMed Central (PMC) Is bipolar disorder more common in highly intelligent people? A cohort study... Anecdotal and biographical reports have long suggested that bipolar disorder is more common in people with exceptional cognitive or creative ability. Epidemiological evidence for such a link is sparse. We investigated the relationship between... Another indication that exceptionally bright people may be at risk of bipolar disorder comes from findings that boys with very high or very low school grades were both more likely than those with average performance to be hospitalised with bipolar disorder as adult We hypothesised that, if men with exceptional intelligence do have an increased risk of bipolar disorder, it will be bipolar disorder in its pure form with no psychiatric comorbidity. Among those who had bipolar disorder in a pure form, we found that men with the highest intelligence, particularly as regards verbal and technical ability, were at increased risk compared to those of average ability

We are supervised at every moment so there is not really space for mistakes, we have a lot of safety checks in place. As a CNA or tech, you’re not going to be doing really any serious dangerous things impacting a person’s life like a nurse would. You’ll be doing things like caretaking (cleaning people, feeding them, dressing them, taking them to potty, etc) and cleaning/making beds. It’s not glamorous but it’s a very important job and it is so helpful to the nurses. I would say that this job would still be doable for you as the worst thing I imagine could happen with a bad attention span as a CNA is maybe you forget to take someone to the bathroom on time and have to clean them up.

It’s not nice to make people feel bad but the solution is simple: Stop doing it! But I’ve read a lot of our posts and I don’t know what you’re talking about when you say you hurt people. I never saw that. If there’s someone you hurt than this apology is a good thing to do. Now it’s over, move on."

176204959,Maybe trying 60mg of latuda and 2 or 1 mg of risperidone would give you some improvement? I think I saw a post a ways back of someone that takes a little latuda to help with negatives I can’t find it now though. I think it improves my mood a little. My mood was kid of low when I was on risperidone.
174394903,"I agree with both _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ . Other illnesses can be like this, but schizophrenia can be a rather egocentric illness in ways. It can sometimes feel like a person with schizophrenia wonders if they’re the center of the universe, if not the center of everything. I know for the longest time I’ve wondered if I was a narcissist, myself, more specifically a covert narcissist, in recent years. In a more recent visit with my pdoc, I finally asked him if he saw anything like it in me, and he said no. And yes, pretty much everyone has narcissistic tendencies. Also, yes, ask your psychiatrist."
174394911,"Supplements which help with negative symptoms include NAC with cofactors like selenium. Doctor’s best brand NAC have such a formulation. PubMed Improvement of Cognitive Function in Schizophrenia With N-acetylcysteine: A... Objectives: Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric illness associated with positive and negative symptoms as well as significant impairments in cognition. Current antipsychotic medications do not alleviate these cognitive deficits, and more... Sarcosine family supplements like TMG, DMG etc Its best to take these supplements early morning on an empty stomach as these can interfere with sleep if take late. For blunted or flat affect phosphatidylserine soy version find useful. Need to take it before sleep or nap. Effects appear few hours afterwards."
174394907,"I often joke half-seriously that my job description is “mentally ill”. In fact I believe it even if it doesn’t carry much credibility. Schizophrenia feels like work. I believe this world is a dream and one can move between dreams, some of which are more hell like and some of which are more heaven like. When I relapse I descend into hells and try to help people rise out of them. This is the work that I do. When I am sane I spend all my time preparing for the next relapse, not anticipating it, but processing the experiences of hells that I had the last times. I write about my experiences and try to share them lest any one else finds themselves in such hells. I work, work is just the movement of energy, so everything is work, but I am not employed, and I cannot work as an employee because I keep relapsing. I have asked why I have kept relapsing, and I also want to know if I didn’t relapse, what work would I do. I have tried working as an employee in the past and always ended up relapsing and h
aving to quit. Nothing holds my attention as much as descending into hells and proving to myself that this world is a dream. But I don’t really want to continue down this path, at least I don’t think I do, it is frightening and terrible, I am filled with paranoia and I feel unsafe. All work has aspects that are hard. When I am sane, I am for the most part very happy, although some times a bit lonely, so my work as someone who is “mentally ill” is not all bad. But I would prefer to work in some way that had a higher status, did not describe me as a failure, though that description may be in my mind. I don’t know what I can do other than remain schizophrenic. As I said in a previous post, I truly believe everything is a choice. We can choose to regrow limbs even if we have the right set of beliefs. This world is a dream after all and everything in it is in our imagination including our bodies. I need a set of beliefs that will allow me to leave schizophrenia behind, believing it is work is probably on
e of the beliefs I need to discard. But I need alternatives to believe in. Somebody said in answer to my previous post that they got better when they started to realise that what they thought was real was not. I don’t believe anything is real, it is all in my imagination. I need some purpose that is more attractive to me than going into hells and helping people. I don’t really have any desires other than to eat, drink, smoke and sleep, and process my experiences. Where do I start, if I want to move forward? Thank you."
174394905,"about a year ago or so i lived in a group home for the disabled 3 of us were schizophrenic and the other 2 were older guys that im not really sure what they lived with. but each day we had a routine… meds were given out each day at certain times the first being at 7am and at this time you could also start cooking breakfast at 7am… meal time for breakfast was from 7am to 9am and the first group of the day was at 9am. during these groups we usually would sit at a round table and talk about what the topic was that the care giver decided to talk about that was usually about how to better cope with symptoms. we had about a 2 hour break to mingle or leave the building and go wherever we wanted… every time we left we were encouraged to sign a log book that had our name and time we left and the location of where we would be so that the staff would know where we were and if possible when we would be back. at 11am lunch started and ended at 1pm. there was another group at noon that we did and most of t
hese groups throughout the day were about 1 hour long. most of the times like i said it was about mental health awareness and learning more about symptoms that we dealt with or just personal life experiences that we had encountered if we volunteered to share with the group. then from 1pm to 4pm we had another break of doing whatever we wanted for our day… at 4pm this was the afternoon meds line for anyone who had to take meds 3 times a day. Then at 5pm was dinner. we had a schedule of who was going to cook each day and on wednesdays at 9 am group we would go around and see who wanted to volunteer to cook what days of the next week and if they werent at the 9am group we would pick what we would eat for them. whoever cooked also had to clean up the kitchen and dishes and clean the dining room and table. usually the cook would start working on dinner at about 430 typically. then at 7pm there was night meds and the last group of the day, with dinner ending from 5pm to 7pm too. at one point there was some issues 
with people getting into the refridgerator at non designated times who were eating outside of meal time and i was one of them. mainly because when i would get depressed i would sleep all day and not make it to any of the groups so when i would up at night i would go eat in the kitchen and one of the staff the only male person confronted me and told me that he was going to write me up but i rebuked him and said that i had not had anything to eat all day because i had been sleeping and that i did not care what he did, that i was going to eat something regardless. none of us were ever punished for eating outside of meal time even though they did put a note on the fridge that said that after 3 writeups we would be asked to leave the program. on the weekends on saturday’s at 9am we would pick our chores for the week from a list that we would do about 2 or 3 different things like, sweep the entrances, clean all the cabinet doors in the kitchen, water the plants, sweep the parking lot and sidewalks, vacuum the ent
ire floor which was the living room, dining room and hallway, empty the cigarette butt basket which was a coffee can (i dont smoke cigs - however on occasion if i was out of dip i might have some cigs). Every thursday night the staff would unlock the laundry room cabinet and set out all the cleaning materials so we could power clean our rooms and bathrooms for inspection on every friday. most of the time people would pass but there were some times when if we werent careful enough we would fail and have to have another inspection. and there were 6 rooms for 5 of us and the rooms were set up where you had basically a roommate but only shared the bathroom not the actual bedroom so if your roommate failed the inspection since you shared the bathroom then sometimes you had to be reinspected too. also on saturdays at noon near around the beginning of when i lived there someone would cook lunch but that stopped later on. most of the time if we were not in group or something for the group home we would sit outside on 
the back porch which was part of a parking lot and my 2 friends who also lived there would smoke cigarettes and just joke around and talk about whatever came up, i formed a very deep bond with my roommate who was in his early 20s while i was in late 20s… sometimes people would just stay in their rooms and not go to groups but like the last 6 months or so of me living there my state actually had a major budget cut to health services so the company who ran the group home eventually went bankrupt and i think like 3 to 6 months the entire staff went without paychecks because the company couldnt pay wages. apparently they had done that a year or 2 before but this time they ended up going bankrupt and shutting down. living in a group home… there was always something happening and if you needed to talk about anything there was someone there to talk to you 24/7. and as far as health benefits it was probably the best kind of care i have ever received for my schizoaffective. nowadays though most days of the week i 
just chill at home and get on the internet or read or listen to music or message people to chat. i still cook atleast 3 meals a day but most of the time its microwave stuff and not stuff i have ingredients for like the group home. doing my chores now though is a lot easier than what it use to be whenever i feel like a room is getting cluttered i just start picking up and taking care of it whereas when we had chores at the group home it felt more like a weight because we were doing it for the whole group and now that i do chores for myself it feels more beneficial."

174394916,"I’m wondering if anyone else had a similar experience as I did. When I first was exeriencing psychosis in 2010 my parents were convinced I had demons or something. I later had full blown psychosis episode that was very extreme, they just about took me to the psych ward as they had no idea what to do with me anymore. but they were quite against the psychiatry industry. So they kept me in my room and kept an eye on me at home till I mellowed after days. They didnt want me to see a psychiatrist. or a psychologist. I think I ended up seeing a public one about a year later and they said I needed to take 4 different meds, but my parents didnt really want me to do that so that never happened. So i ended up on some alternative med path eventually from my own research since I couldnt go to psychiatrist. I ended up trying niacin for like 4 years. I guess it was something to believe in. I still had several other psychotic episodes during that time. I almost gave up cuz I was so burnt out, thats when I joine
d this forum. Then I started dating my gf in 2016 and she made me go to the psychiatrist thats when I started getting help. and my dad starting researching ways I could get help as well. my psychotic episodes frequency lessened around 2017. but then i just felt brain dead, and negative symptoms got bad. So I was no longer really functioning for work or anything. (oh yeah I worked the whole time this stuff was happening… I had my own business established in like 2008 so I was able to work very part time when needed) Now im much more improved in 2020.

176205040,Only been once for psych care. Sometimes I look back at my hospitalization and wish I was back in there getting served 3 meals a day and chilling on my laptop. But then I remember how miserable and paranoid I was when I was in there and I remind myself that I never want to go back

174394939,I disagree with you that mentally well people can’t think the voices were real. I think it’s just a product of being naive. I think anyone who heard voices could think they are real. I believed in spirits before the psychosis so that led me to believe I was hearing spirits when the voices came especially because they were intelligent. I admit it was a delusion and I no longer believe in it but don’t say I’m a lunatic for believing in it back then. If I didn’t have any other delusions can’t you see that this was a delusion based on circumstance. My version of the illness doesn’t give me delusions I’ve never thought I was a famous actor or that my thoughts were being read or that somebody or the government was out to get me. My illness is different from most people with sz and anything I say none of you will believe me.

176205047,Hmm. You Are Quite The Character. . . . . . .
176205048,I had a running commentary that was criticizing everything I did and judging me. I also had a command hallucination that told me to take all my meds and for some reason I did. In my case it was wise to get rid of the voices. I used to have the delusion that the voices were meaningful windows to my soul but I’ve learned they’re just hallucinations and they have no value.

176205051,I had flashbacks and nightmares until I got on an AP. Now I have way fewer nightmares
176205052,"SLEEPMD, a non prescription med, works for me. I take two pills instead of one. Other prescription meds that I took, were a nightmare. They inhibited my chance to fight back against the voices, etc. In other words, they put to sleep the part of my mind that fights back, the part that keeps me in control. The outcome was pure hell. So be careful."

A proper hydrogen water machine can make -600 or lower ORP water, but my 2 liter machine broke, and I’m too lazy to make hydrogen water 500 ml at a time with my smaller machine. The 2l machine costs like $150, but I can’t quite afford that atm."
174394938,I had command hallucinations/thoughts. Feelings inside me implanted by an external force telling me to do something. The abilify stopped this. Since I was 5 I had ocd. Counting and stuff. Zoloft and abilify has helped me have a less obsessive thought process in general. I used to get way too fixated on things. Sometimes these mental health disorders and treatments cross over with one another.
174394943,You’re right. People who have irritability in their personality are functional in life unlike me. In my case not being able to do anything and staying in bed all day everyday is the cause and not my personality. I can know ppl’s personalities and know that mine doesn’t have irritability.
176205072,I’m rarely bored when I’m not feeling ok. My mind provides enough “entertainment” so I don’t feel bored. But I feel ok today and I’m bored out of my tree.

Don’t stop. Set reasonable goals. Hit them. Set more goals. Keep a recovery journal. Be a part of the world as much as you’re able… Keep exercising your body and mind, don’t let either atrophy.

I saw a book written in Mandarin linking Schizophrenia to Capitalism, something that has been done by some psychiatrists in the West as well, mostly in the 60s.

176205160,Last night the neighbor confronted my ex angrily stating he just saw him shooting the gun. My ex was floored. He of course denied it but the neighbor said you may have the cops and the manager fooled but I know the truth. Today the manager asked if we had any contact with the neighbor and I told him what happened. He asked me for a written account of everything that has gone on. All the times he’s contacted us regarding this supposed gun being shot and all the times the police have contacted us and the conversation we had with his ex-wife regarding his meds making him hallucinate detailed in writing. So I wrote it all down. The manager is planning on taking action against the neighbor of some kind to get him to stop harassing us. The police were here the night before last and the officer told us that he calls up to 4 times a day to report the gun shots. I wish I knew what I could do to help this situation. This poor man truly believes my ex is shooting a gun off all the time.

176205175,"The feeling of insomnia drove me to anguish, sending me over the edge in terms of sanity. The asinine slumbers rent asunder black and white minimalist dreams before the day of doom when before I thought myself sane although afterward I was insane, hence, insanity, I should look out a window seeing a pizza delivery car drive past without rendering its measurements as a thought icon, as thought icon of thinking is a delusion of the mysteries of creation, at the seat or buttock of madness. The advertising pressure, or peer pressure, such as smoking marijuanna, and the rising tide of a changing society at times gave me more anxieties, or tensions, of executive function, and of respite psychosis. I was schizoid, socially withdrawn at parties where it was announced about _NAME_, and then I was dissociative. My allowance of faculties was wiped, like wiping an infants ass, by my loss of executive function. There was then an avoidance of the delusions that sat over belief, like that I deluded myself into a

I keep the phone in case there really are men there and I need to call the police. I can’t tell the difference, and if I’m home alone, there is nobody to help me check to make sure it’s safe. It’s scary to feel this way. I usually call my pdoc or my husband. Pdoc has me take extra APs, and hubby just talks to me to calm me down. Do you have anyone you trust whom you can talk to? You are dealing with delusions, not actuality. It’s the sz messing with you. If you feel the need to call the cops, try calling someone else instead who can help you reason through the delusion. Also, get in touch with your pdoc and explain your symptoms, especially mentioning that it is severe enough that you want to call the police. That should help him/her understand the gravity of the situation better."

I was originally clued up about all my mental health related circumstances, but once I officially got a face to face statement of schizophrenia diagnosis. I stopped caring about details and started finding ways to cheat the disease - which partly meant, no longer care about managing health and start caring about striving to improve health. This approach meant that slowly (out of hope mindset) the right habits or solutions will come naturally - the main caveat is that you could ruin your health, be it mental or physical or both, before a solution ever gets to be adopted."

176205273,"I used to be able to work some when I took the meds and the voices made me completely incompetent when I didn’t. The meds were expensive at times and a relapse was very expensive so I needed help to pay for it. The meds are not always just something to take. They were the difference between some functionality and none at all. The idea that being disabled meaning that you “can’t work any job” is wrong but it is true that the long term prognosis for working until retirement is not good with some of the disorders we have. I am not working now partly due to the aftereffects of a relapse and partially due to the side effects of the meds but in my 20’s, 30’s, and mid 40’s I was able to work and go to school. The relapse came partially due to my father dying I also had a sleeping pill addiction left over from the full time VISTA job I had which was a lot tougher than the volunteer and minimum wage Library jobs I had before then."
176205274,So I had my final appointment before my psychiatrist retires. I was pretty upset as he was a good doctor who has treated me for 15 years since I was 17. I am now on Zoloft (Sertraline) 50mg which I start today. If anyone has any advice on how good of a drug it is I would appreciate it? He took me off Olanzapine 10mg PRN as he said it gave me cogwheel rigidity. My Amisulpride has been put back to 800mg as the difference to 1000mg was negligible. I have to stay on Diazepam 15mg a day for the next 3-4 months. I have also been signed off work for two weeks so will be online more if anyone wants to chat with me

176205277,"Welcome to the forum!!! Back when I had Medicaid and didn’t have to pay for my meds, I loved getting the Invega shot. There was no need to have to remember my med. it was so convenient. I’m on Haldol now. 10 mg of haldol"

176205281,My insurance will be over maybe this year. I think depot is too expensive for me. I heard haldol is really effective. I hope there would be less side effects.
176205282,well. to learn is a must. but still i stand behind my opinion.

176205287,That’s a good one.
176205288,The FDA didn’t reject it. There was a study (on ITI-007) where it didn’t do better than placebo. But there were several where it did. The FDA will decide based on all the studies. Having a single negative study result doesn’t disqualify a medication.
176205289,I’m doing okay
176205290,"Ha, you got seduced, i have tried that as well. In old folklore it’s called an Succbus. From wiki: “A succubus is a demon or supernatural entity in folklore, in female form, that appears in dreams to seduce men, usually through sexual activity. According to religious traditions, repeated sexual activity with a succubus can cause poor physical or mental health, even death. In modern representations, a succubus is often depicted as a beautiful seductress or enchantress, rather than as demonic or frightening. The male counterpart to the succubus is the incubus.”"

Risperidone makes me a bottomless pit, and while I don’t mind being bigger based on aesthetics alone, my joints are really feeling the weight gain. My feet hurt all the time and it’s hard for me to get around like I used to. Some people just handle it better I guess."

176205297,You demonstrate an astounding lack of insight into your delusions. Generally not good for someone who is failing reality testing to be in a relationship. You will be easy to take advantage of and abuse. Being honest.

176205301,Have usually started with me believing that a girl that I had a crush on in high school that I had walked with every day senior year gets in my head and I even seen a tv show with her nickname on it which felt staged and I feel as if the world knows about us and even had a relative say that I was going to get married which I thought was weird I still get dreams about her to this day about once a week but in on meds but it’s been almost ten years since I seen her last anyone got anything to say or advice

174395011,Don’t take NAC with abilify. That would be my advice ! It seems to make abilify much less effective.
176205309,Don’t take so many sleeping pills! You have a good perspective on life.
176205310,I only slept about 5 hours but yet it’s an improvement over the last 2 days. Sometimes I sleep through most of the night and wake up at 4 am and think that’s beyond wonderful. I used to sleep a few minutes or less on average when this disorder began and haven’t slept without a drug since 1992. I used to be very obsessed with the idea that living this way was terrible. Then I got over the idea of how abnormal my sleep patterns are and how it affects my life and just learned to live with it. I am a true night owl.
176205311,I will shower in 9-10 days.

176205324,"I never said that anything is infinite. “Forever” (the only time I came close), doesn’t mean infinite. It means I want to see every tomorrow, and so I shall, well for me at any rate. Being atheist puts you squarely in the same bucket with the theists, by the way. You can’t possibly know, and yet you can pick a side. Then…Phew… I think that you’ll find that I just simplified it. You’re the one trying to make it all complicated again. I’d like to add that in my last post it can come across that I was “making light” of the “broke myself just right” bit, I wasn’t. If this is a multiverse of all possible universes…And, this is a possible universe then it has/had/will have to be. Oh, and perhaps now would be a good time to scroll back up, and actually watch “Imagine”. Full screen volume up. Maybe you’ll feel just a little of what I live with."

176205328,I don’t have to be off my Buproprion very long before I spiral down into a deep depression. I sometimes wonder what it would be like living on the street in a deep depression. The best solution to that is not to go back out onto the street.

174395026,severe depression was my first diagnosis
176205330,"Try natural alternatives like DMG or TMG, phosphatidylserine etc. Both of these help in reducing, anxiety, depression and improves cognition, memory etc. Both of these help in increasing energy, better workout performance and aids in muscle recovery. Phosphatidylserine reduces cortisol levels and gives restful sleep at night."
176205331,"Veeeery difficult. When i eat a little sugar, i want more and more…so i try not to eat at all."
176205332,It’s not a mistake if you’re willing to open up a little. Just don’t make blanket statements about us. The majority really want tohelp people overcome their delusions and progress toward feeling more in co trol. You won’t know if it helps if you say you don’t trust us and run away. Running away from problems or help doesn’t solve anything. Give it a chance here. Give us a chance before saying we aren’t trustworthy.

176205335,"I tried stopping meds in 2012 of course I didn’t even believe I was sick then so at least you have that going for you. I didn’t make it months I was in an ER in less than 5 days. Had the scariest hallucinations ever. I thought it was real while they were happening. It’s a long story. I have shared it a time or two. It was really bad but I was locked up when it happened so I was safe. I take the maximum dose of Geodon and a small dose of Latuda and I work full time and do all the housework. My wife isn’t psychotic but does have social anxiety but she won’t clean anything. My house isn’t spotless but I do the dishes, laundry and vacuum up the dog hair. Occasionally I will dust and clean the bathrooms. I keep the litter boxes clean and take out the trash. My wife complains it’s not clean enough and wouldn’t let me invite anyone over for the 4th of July and says we are ghetto but she certainly isn’t going to clean anything. It’s acceptable to me. Ghetto fabulous I guess. If it weren
’t for APs I couldn’t do any of it. I would be institutionalized. You need to think about this some more but if I didn’t know I would relapse for certain I would try too. Good luck if you decide to do it."
176205336,_AT_MENTION_ I love electric guitar just as much as the acoustic but I have to admit I’m just a “backyard picker” and I do better for the majority of the songs I know to play on the acoustic…I just bought a 12 string guitar today.

176205346,I dont fear death so much welcome it in fact. its eternal torment in hell what im afraid of a lot of my delusions are based around religion
176205347,I don’t know. Maybe I’ll try going down to 8mg for a week or so. I see my pdoc on the 12th. I’m just so sick of all these side effects. I have enough health problems already. I really don’t need this ???? on top of everything else. I’m also pretty sure I was only in the hospital last year because of a bad reaction to the haldol. After I finally came off it I started feeling much better.

176205351,I don’t sleep as well on Abilify as I did on Zyprexa and Risperdal. Maybe because Zyprexa and Risperdal are really sedating.

174395020,"i had a delusion i was an alien like an annunaki but there’s little to no evidence since I cannot walk on water and do miracles…haha. I mean some people think and view the anunnaki as gods, but I don’t have that view or belief system. I feel like I had my mind uploaded to a computer like a quantum computer or AI or some crap and can remember past lives or past loops or iterations that span an eternity or infinity and thus I have near infinite capacity in this matrix or simulation of human behavior and life… There’s a totem pole and I am on the bottom sort of like an alien hierarchy. I have no powers here no clout. I think I tried to reach enlightenment in my original life and thus this is the culmination of all my hard work: nothing expect pain and suffering and falsehoods… I don’t know what the anunnaki are but I am not a powerful one at least. I am weak. I am human looking but I am also schizophrenic as the doctors say which is why I am here. I have memories of escaping reality and 
going outside the simulation and running it on my _NAME_ computer or whatever it was. Magic of course. Different laws of physics. Brain in a vat type stuff. Very frightening and traumatizing. I don’t know what the anunanki are. Maybe they were created themselves by off races or higher beings but they used to talk to me as a kid… Then I have theories that they are not really gods, but computer simulators. Perhaps are distant ancestors from the future or geneticists. I never worked on genetics, didn’t create the human race, or mine gold. That’s pretty much my story and why people don’t believe me or something and I’m disabled and pratically ?????? up for life and eternity. Am I a cyborg android robot? Am I an alien hybrid or am I just a fallen angel from the Bible? I don’t know. There are good ones and bad ones. I’ve experienced both in all my past lives…"

176205378,I would love to live in the country again. It was pretty perfect with my x and his dogs but if I was to live in the country by myself in a house I would worry about getting raped and robbed perhaps and also not being able to fix things. I loved that area where I used to live but I don’t know if there was lots of crime or not. That area is more poor than the area I live in now yet I favour the poorer area. I was happiest as a country chic but that was thanks to the great partner I had and his dogs too . It was pretty perfect. But what was pretty perfect is worth about a tenth of what houses here are worth. The area I live in now is much more expensive. Before covid19 people said g’day but now they sometimes don’t say hello back when I say hello. It’s a friendly enough neighbourhood I guess but some people clearly don’t like me like the local dog trainer and some chics who work at Coles and some at the gym and where I agist etc etc My favourite area to live was the poorer place. Only a tenth 
of what houses here are worth. That’s a big difference. I am thankful though. I live in a beautiful place. I could never afford to buy or rent here but get cheaper rent because I live in family apartment. I want to move back to my x. Appreciate having a home though. Lots of people who work very very hard can’t afford to live in this area so i have it good I have a place to live. It’s not the friendliest neighbourhood to me and I avoid some people but I have difficulties with most people. It is not a high crime area thankfully. Hope it will remain that way. South Australia out country with x n dogs da best. I’m in NSW now and living by myself with my dog. People might be angry if they lost work and can’t afford to live here anymore due to covid19 and I don’t even work at all and can afford to live here. A guy I was seeing was jealous of me I think because he couldn’t afford to keep living here and had to sell his place and move somewhere cheaper.to a cheaper neighbourhood. Can’t date a guy jeal
ous of me and always angry at me. The worst neighbourhood I ever lived in was a place in Sweden where I was bullied every day and I was a sl ut without wanting to be and never had a boyfriend and was treated so badly and was sometimes raped too. It was supposed to be a fancy neighbourhood but to me it was disgusting people with disgusting behaviour. Everyone in that neighbourhood had to wear the same clothes unless they were popular then they could get away with not doing so. I had the worst times of my life I think in this hateful place with hateful people. There was no love for me there only hate and being treated horribly. I would not want to live in a city. I’m a country gal at heart. I live in a town now I think. It’s not tiny nor huge. Has some shops n cafes. Close to ocean beach and forest. The richer neighbourhood isn’t always the best. Not always to me anyway.

Go to your room, close the door and wait it out. Discuss it with them when they stop yelling.

Why wouldn’t anyone just kill you outright instead of giving you plastic surgery then installing you as dictator of North Korea? You do realize you are a powerless person with schizophrenia. You are not at all important to the United States government. For a government to kill you, they can do it outright. Look at what happened to the Iranian general who got bombed in a car all the way in Iran 6000 miles away from United States. You are a powerless person in your own country.

174395039,I’m on 15mg and it’s anxiety city. I take the following supplements to keep anxiety manageable: L-theanine (750mg / day in divided doses) Beta Alanine (750mg/day) Broccoli sprout extract Taurine (500mg a day) It’s either taking those supplements or taking a benzo. Niether myself nor my psychiatrist want me on a benzo.

176205401,when are going to take Vraylar or Zyprexa?
174395030,"I’m sorry to read this. On the one hand it’s nice to know that there’s someone who’s going through the same thing and can share their experience, on the other it’s sad, I wouldn’t wish the worst enemy to feel such pain and suffering. I’m still pretty young, but trust me, I’ve gone through a lot in my life and this must be the worst thing I have ever experienced. I was close to suicide too, after I was given the drug, but somehow I have found the will to endure it. Most suicidal thoughts I had recently, when at some point I thought “it’s not even getting better after all this time, I should feel better by now, why is it even worse than at the beginning?”. So in my case it looks like this: at the very beginning I was dealing with a large akathisia, aphasia and anxiety, though I was able to leave home, go for a walk, go to the city by bus, but it wasn’t because I wanted to, it was because my akathisia caused me to be in constant motion. Same as you, I lost interest in doing lit
erally anything. And everything tired me, I have lost contact with my online friends, because I didn’t have the strength to write with them. So afterall I was completely alone. Then I was prescribed pridinol, an anticholinergic drug and after starting it, not only akathisia disappeared, but somehow I started to enjoy listening to music and I regained hope that everything will be alright one day. It lasted for, I don’t know, three weeks maybe, then there was such a time, about 2-3 weeks that I started to feel terrible and was even thinking of going back to the hospital, but I knew that they’d feed me neuroleptics, so I decided not to do anything with it, just wait. And so now I feel a little bit better fortunately. Now it’s like one day of feeling relatively okay, I’m in a little better mood, enjoying music and stuff, but still anxious, then there’s two days of dying inside, not talking to anyone, not doing anything and it happens over and over again. After all I hope it’s just a process in which 
my mood and body condition changes every now and then until it’s stable, because the drug is being removed little by little. So what I can say is that fortunately I’m slowly getting back my interest in doing things and enjoying different stuff, mostly music. Today I even ordered new wireless headphones, because music gives me satisfaction again and that gives me hope of recovering to my old self. Sure, I too am afraid that I’ll never get my normal self, especially when it comes to aphasia and intelligence, I’m afraid that I’ll never be able to communicate with people like I used to and that I’ll never lose my anxiety. But I have noticed that recently I started to sometimes use a little more complex expressions and I feel that in the next few months there will be drastic changes for the better. I hope there will be. About the reward system, I don’t know if that’s a good example, but after the shot I have almost completely lost my libido, sex drive etc., but it has improved recently. So don’t 
worry, you have to survive a little more time and I’m sure you’ll get back your drive, you’ll get your reward system fixed. Oh, and my concentration has also improved a little, I’m surprised that I’m able to read and write all these posts. I should probably make mine shorter, haha."

It was first named by the neurologist _NAME_ in 1914. Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neurological disorder.

I was furious at the time, because the pain was awful, but after a while I realized I was grateful. Anyways, I’ve been saving the last four pills for the past 13 years. I know, that is stupid. They’re probably very expired and useless by now. But I just felt safer knowing they were there as a backup, in case the pain ever got too bad. Today, I just put them in the med drop box at the pharmacy. They’re gone forever, and I’ll never get any more. They interact with Geodon, so nobody would ever prescribe them to me.

We are all simply beings trying to get through life as best as we can. We have all been caked in mud along the way, so none of us are perfect. Odds are, let’s be honest, you get up their noses too. Tense relationships stem from somewhere, you’re not living in a vaccume. This is going to sound “cornball”, but love is the answer. I love every being that ever was, is, or ever will be. How? Simple: “Is it your ‘fault’, that you’re the way that you are?” “Is it anybody’s ‘fault’, that they’re who they are?” Well I could say yes, for rather essoteric reasons, but the actual answer is no. Try “understanding”, it’s much easier, and leads you to a much happier life."

176205522,"I’ve been on invega sustenna injection for almost two years now. They gave it to me when I left the hospital because I wasn’t totally compliant with the oral invega. Now I take both the maximum injection of the invega sustanna and 6 mg oral as needed. The injection is what has really worked well and taken away 90% of hallucinations / delusions. I started trintellix about 5 weeks ago and ended up in the hospital with migranes (diziness, vomiting etc.) The headaches have stopped after about one month of having them. They decreased in severity after about 3 weeks. I’m glad now because trinellix has improved my neuro cognitive abilities. I was on Paxil before this for 21 years. Paxil is more of a sedative vs. Trintellix, almost a stimulant. I don’t have as many daily bouts of depression with Trintellix I don’t sleep as much but not as lethargic during the day. I have a part time job now and can actually focus and think more clearly on the Trillinex. Having the migranes was the worst i’ve ev

174395086,I had the delusion in 2011 that I was an alien and every other living creature was a robot. From mosquitoes to cats to other humans. And I was to be raised on the planet earth but really my home planet was far and distant. And every human in the futuristic society was given there own planet for the first 21 years 5 months and 16 days before they return to their home planet to be with the other aliens. Away from the robots. I thought this right after they gave me clozapine. And then my belief changed and I thought I was Jesus. And December 21 2012 changed to the idea that that was what marked my return to the world. Then 2012 passed and I thought I’m supposed to return to the public’s eye in 2020 when I turn 30. Now that it doesn’t seem possible I say 35. But lately having the thought a lot “I may be Jesus but that doesn’t mean I have to be famous”. Ummm well you once said “the greatest enlightenment is of the boddhastiva”. Or the teacher. And that creates a yin in my head for the wan
t to teach others certain ways. And then I have the yang where I think enlightenment =contentment. I’m not blaming you AT ALL btw. We probably all convince others of delusions at some points whether intentional or not. My delusions are inevitable I just try to go with the flow with them Whatever manifests is meant to be. I think we gotta take care of ourselves and challenge delusions. But sometimes I challenge one delusion and it just leads to another one!! I can see how crazy i am now. But my belief in a higher power makes me think it is “meant to be”.

But honestly, this is only online, so it may not be too big of a deal. We may lose you on SZ.com, but we honestly enjoyed your time here and only care if you happy with yourself.

176205624,"Ok, my psychiatrist is really handsome, but for me he is only my doctor. Someone like me would never have another kind of relationship with someone like him. That’s imposible! I feel I can trust him and I know I can call him if I have a problem, but that’s all."
176205625,No I haven’t what about him
176205626,I used to be addicted to alcohol and cigs but now it’s just energy drinks for me.
174395100,"It was in 2003 when I had my first psychosis episode. I was 16 then. I could not get through an entrance exam for engineering and it hurt me so much that i think I had narssistic injury. Some how I passed higher secondary exams. My academic performance had declined significantly. I went to university. Somehow I got through but my performance kept on declining. I could land into a job in 2011. By this time, I had started delusional beliefs that my office peers are all planning to get me. I believed some of them are from RAW, the Indian intelligence agency. But smoking would help me to control my delusions.I smoked heavily. In 2012, I left job and was put into mental health hospital. I was given ECT and was put on amisulpride. Somehow I got normal. It was not told me that I had schizophrenia. I took medicines for some days and gave up as I felt normal. But the symptoms relapsed. It took me 6 years to realise I was suffering from schizophrenia. That too with use of Google. In 2018, I changed my pdoc. 
The new pdoc put me on amisulpride and clopixol depot and several anti depressants which he would slowly reduce over 2 years. I am now on clopixol depot only.It’s 2020, after 17 years of first episode, I am feeling normal as I was before. My delusions have gone. I am having a regular life. I am working in my farms and shop. On 6th December 2020, I am turning 34, and the same day I am getting married and starting new life.f For Those who are going through same condition, its my advice to take their medicines honestly and regularly. You too can win."
174395098,"CoQ10 seems like a sort of “wonder if it’ll work on X” thing (they’ve tried it on hypertension, migraines, cancer etc). Sorry to hear that it didn’t work, but always glad when schizophrenia gets research dollars. Maybe the next thing will work."
176205627,For me it was the other people that made it hell. I wish I was homeschooled. What was it for you that caused you to dislike it?
176205628,likely. my pdoc used to emphasize that many of the side effects are really from the disease of sz and not so much from the meds as we think… _NAME_
176205629,You can try to make friends at the psych ward… Have you tried?
176205630,"I had quite a lot of potential, but years of substandard support and treatment put paid to that."
176205631,Are you not on meds?
176205632,The key is finding the right medicine and stabilizing on the smallest possible dose. For me that is .5mg to 1mg haldol
176205633,Been 2 days and no compulsive face washing. Therapy FTW I just changed my beliefs so far now. Lets see what happens in coming weeks. Will have to continue exposure.
176205634,"i do 70 press ups every morning in one go, also."
176205635,"One time it took me weeks, another time days, yes it seems to vary with antipsychotics"
176205636,Done by Wednesday night bad things will happen to me. I feel on the edge of insanity.
176205637,"Your partner is clearly OK with this, he’s still with you."
176205638,I was pretty coordinated as a kid. When I got older I started tripping and falling more. I fall on stairs a lot. I have to be careful. I also developed twitches right before the psychosis started. I still have an annoying head twitch. It’s not often but it’s weird when I’m talking to someone and it happens.
176205639,"I just went to Walgreens, even though I am depressed and stressed out. I got cigarettes. I’m stressed out and depressed, because I just realized I was delusion when I woke up this morning. Does anybody else get depressed and stressed out when you realize you are delusional?"
176205640,I can understand your sentiment…still hope you can get something useful out of it though.
176205641,I dont remember what my dosage was. I was taking two sarcosine pills a day…from thttps://www.profrontal.com/ bottles and two pills of the secondary supplement. I think my dosage was lower. I’ll find out when I get my new bottles what the dosage was.
174395095,"Hello to all I’m just joining you guys! After a few years with symptoms, I’ve been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and PTSD from events around the time it started. I was wondering if anyone else has PTSD in addition to schizoaffective disorder? Interested in hearing others’ stories and maybe learning new coping skills. Cheers!"
176205642,"Sorry to say, but yeah. It is not covered by most insurance because it is so new."
176205643,"_PERSON_ is a no-go from me, dawg. It made the voices super intense, along with huge amounts of anxiety after a day."
176205644,I have the same problem. I’m not good with going with the flow. I’m good at planning things though.
176205645,Yeah more power to you! Sounds like a bit of fun but look after yourself. A car is something you need to maintain so some regular services and some basic mechanical skills are necessary. You need to know how to change a flat tire and an oil change is pretty simple. Look after your car and it’ll look after you!
176205646,Wishing you the best in your endeavours. You’ll make it!
176205647,"My provider is often telling me not to go to her husband but to go to her. This is difficult for me as he’s the only male association I have. I can do it, it just requires a little discipline."
176205648,I’m just amazed that a person can start a thread about themselves and get so many replies. I’ve never seen it before with anyone else.
176205649,Why do you think you were faking? Maybe you weren’t and we’re just in denial. Maybe it felt better to deny it as really happening to you and just convincing yourself that you were faking
176205650,This is a red flag. Call the cops.

174395103,"I dunno, I was talking with my therapist this week about this, but I’ve pretty much always been like this (ie. since childhood) only now it’s like the dial has been turned WAY up. I’m an only child with a traumic upbringing so escaping into my mind, having a fractured sense of self, isolation, etc. has always been “normal” to me. I mean, it remains “normal” to me only now, as an adult, it presents itself as what my doc diagnoses as schizophrenia. That’s my understanding of it anyway. The clinic I go to & the people I see there are all pretty open-minded about the whole psychosis thing, though."
176205653,_PERSON_ it does. There was that clip of the documentary with the British bodybuilder that got an infection injecting it with dirty needles.
176205654,Airplane/ Flying High…just a stupid movie with lots of dumb jokes but works so well. Surely you can’t be serious!
176205655,Tell her you’re secretly in love with her and want her to have your baby. That outta scare her off.
176205656,"With your height, you weight is pretty normal. You couldn’t lose more than maybe 10-15 pounds before you’d be at the border of being too thin. 50 would be way too much, and you’d look very unhealthy."
176205657,I’m not fearful anymore
176205658,I think the devil killed them because he wanted them to go to hell and had to bring a clone to not make it obvious they died. I don’t think everyone in my high school class. But some of them. Mostly the ones I was closest to.
176205659,If reality would be a dream I would be a sex super hero wealthy guru who is immortal and smarter than everyone in the universe.
176205660,I’m on 200mg of clozapine and its ok
176205661,From my experience its purely biological.
176205662,I was talking to a friend for over an hour. Now I am vaping and listening to music in bed. I will sit with my parents soon.
176205663,I’ll make one for you. I have all the ingredients.
176205664,Okay. Yeah that’s what I was talking about. The only symptom I have is a fever. I’ve had it over a week now without being sick.
176205665,it also looks like a woman lying down I can see
176205666,I am Christian too. I have people doing things to me. I think miracles do happen sometimes what I want is not that much.
176205667,"Welcome on board _AT_MENTION_, hope you enjoy your stay."
176205668,"hypnogogic, but it means the malleable dream like state that you enter between deep sleep and waking, I think. I think you mean biphasic sleep: en.wikipedia.org Biphasic and polyphasic sleep Biphasic sleep (or diphasic, bifurcated, or bimodal sleep) is the practice of sleeping during two periods over the course of 24 hours, while polyphasic sleep refers to sleeping multiple times—usually more than two. Each of these is in contrast to monophasic sleep, which is one period of sleep within 24 hours. Segmented sleep and divided sleep may refer to polyphasic or biphasic sleep, but may also refer to interrupted sleep, where the sleep has one or several shorter periods of wakefulness. A"
176205669,"I’m getting to that point too, but it remains to hard to explain it to others without sounding delusional."
174395099,"my mum was the person that affected me hugely for my schizophrenia. sometimes, it doesn’t mean she is your mum/best friend = good advice. everyone is a human mate. I am 34 this year and still forced to live with my parents."
174395101,LS! Maybe try Lion’s Mane mushroom and maybe tocotrienols.
176205670,I talk to people on this site about my sza all the time. I talk to nobody about it irl.
176205671,I wish my parents hadn’t waited for me to grow up. They should have divorced when I was little. A broken marriage is way better for children than a dysfunctional home.
176205672,aw you are lucky with that…
176205673,"Also I was friend with a girl my age back then like 21y.o., one night she came to my bed and wanted a bj lol I said no as I had a gf back then. Another day she wanted to take a shower with me lol"

176205676,I feel the difference for me now is I can focus better on one task without getting distracted too easily. Especially getting distracted with delusions. I still will have delusions but don’t let them control/run my life so much.
176205677,You’ve been paranoid since you were SZ and then finally got your paranoia lowered after this last hospitalization? Were you on meds before your last hospitalization?
176205678,don’t listen to the voices that tell you to stop your medication… i’d tell your pdoc about it and see if your meds can get changed… but stopping the medication is not really good to do.
176205679,I just bought a multivitamin that contains 110mg of Magnesium. I’m going to start taking this to supplement my low Magnesium deficiency. Hopefully this will be enough. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_
174395102,"No but some experience these on partial dopamine agonists Abilify, Rexulti and Vraylar. I didnt. I was on Abilify 20mg for 8 years."
176205680,Wow! That’s incredible!
176205681,"Pdocs are really just there to make sure you’re medications are working, They’re not therapists. Mine just asks me the normal are you okay, not going to kill yourself type questions, We do the injection and we’re done. If you need someone to listen to you and help guide you, You should see a therapist because the pdoc is not the place for that."
176205682,I gained 35 lbs on risperidone. I lost 18 eating 900 calories a day drinking a lot of protein shakes and small snacks. Still working on it
176205683,"Still seeing it? I know how hard facing the fact that one cant trust the physical senses can be. But as I tried to learn more about it, I also realized that when I understood it was an illusion, I was still in control. As long as it hadn’t fooled me and as long as it was not an immediate threat to me physically, it would be either an interesting show to experience or a boring one that I just needed to wait out."
176205684,I’m thinking about calling a suicide hotline. Maybe you could too. I think about leaving and never coming back. I don’t have the means for it. Getting away from the source of the problems for a while helps. I’m ??????? tired of ???? too. Please be strong.
176205685,"This morning I woke up from a nightmare disoriented and delusional. In a panic I started talking to my boyfriend about it and he responded so well he just held me, comforted me. He didn’t tell me it wasn’t real and he didn’t feed into the delusion either. He just was there for me until I calmed down. I really feel so lucky to have him!!"
176205686,"Naps help. I was paranoid all day, i slept for an hour and im better. Meds dont help?"
176205687,Please keep the IQ test stuff to one thread. You’re spamming.
176205688,"I’m really sorry that you’re feeling like this, _AT_MENTION_. The nice thing about this forum is that you don’t have to pretend to be okay. We understand. Today, I’m having problems with depression/loneliness and paranoia. I’m really worried that someone may be in the house, so I’m scared to go downstairs and get the broccoli that I want to eat."

174395104,"I have the fairly typical disharmonic/spiky cognitive profile of someone on the autism spectrum. It’s hard to separate what has always bee n there due to the developmental disorder, and what began after the emergence of severe mental illness. My crystallised intelligence is significantly better than my fluid intelligence. The latter has improved though with adopting a less defeatist attitude to something I’m not naturally talented at. The standout cognitive deficit is undoubtedly executive functioning;especially when it comes to organising and planning/doing multistep tasks."
176205691,I’m taking Sarcosine and Nac for two days now I notice some improvements but I’m not up to the recommended dose yet
176205692,"I’m not completely delusional. But these are my beliefs. Even if I was on antipsychotics, I would still believe this."

176205697,I thought I was royal. I thought dolphins were sharks and they transformed. I thought my best friends were having sex with my soul mate and moaning and talking badly of me. I thought my friends pretended to love me and betrayed me. I thought my x mum kept screaming she’s better at maths than me. I thought I was reincarnated and kept getting aborted. I thought I was more precious and superior than _NAME_ angels. I thought everyone was jealous of me and attacking me.
174395106,"I had religious delusions and thought I experienced miracles, saw heaven, etc Now that meds work I know that it was my schizophrenia."
174395114,Yes you can fell the difference after some 4 hrs.

With my doctor i lowered to 1.5 mg like 2 months ago and the antipsychotic effects remain or something, i do not always have psychotic symptoms even without any meds if i sleep(which usually requires 100mg quetiapine). No i have been totally sober for 10 days and feel really good. I have not felt this active for a long time and everything is going fine. I still have some minor negatives like my concentration is bad but thats because my doc stopped my adhd-meds because i was abusing drugs. Seems like best antipsychotic so far that i have tried. Or i am just having a good episode, hard to tell. I will inform how it is going later if i manage to stay sober and keep achieving my other goals."

I also do not have health insurance and the insurance companies won’t register me in because I have sz and my MD is apparently expensive…welp. They said I need to wait like 5 years to get registered with clean psych records! I’m trying to look for financial aid programs in your country through dioceses of Catholic Church.

176205753,Way to go _AT_MENTION_ ! That’s AMAZING!!! I’m sooo very proud of you? Do you feel accomplished? Does it feel good?
176205754,Is that the first type of vape machine you ever tried _AT_MENTION_ ?
176205755,Aww hugssss leaf
176205756,"Oh, okay, yeah I was under the impression that you just recently got off the haldol. It’s interesting, really. Haldol works fast, but my pdoc says it’s really not the best AP. That’s why I have it for prn."
174395122,"I’m hopeful about treatment paths but I can’t really dispense all the info I want to here. Unorthodox. There is some headway in terms of certain supplements but it’s a slow kind of build to making a case for them. I’d recommend Amyloban and _NAME_, for starters. May tilt the balance in favor of some kind of functionality. But they’re crutches ultimately. They don’t heal you."
176205757,I agree with _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ Why don’t you draw a family together. That would be nice.
176205758,Very well done as usual. You have a great understanding of space and how to fill it properly and artisticly. That you do this with your hands is much respect from here. Much respect.
176205759,I’ve tried two antidepressants and one mood stabilizer and none of them did anything at all. No noticeable side-effects either. Except that one made me manic. Antidepressants are usually just add-on treatments when you have sz. You can probably quit if you don’t like it. Ask your doctor.
176205760,I resonate with that. Just giving posts likes and not contributing much.
176205761,"Yeah thanks for replying. I liked Aristada so dealing with the withdrawal is sort of annoying. The pros: more emotions, empathy, ability to cry and feel cons: fatigue, weight gain, body going numb and the roller coaster of side effects makes me simply question whether its worth it to continue on this path. Also with the stress of classes coming up Im not sure which is worse trying to get back on the high dose that i may be withdrawn from and start over or deal with what i have now."
176205762,It’s mediocre lol
176205763,This is suspicious. Since when do Kryptonians get the flu? Earth viruses work on you guys about as well as Earth bullets. Hmmmph. [ massively raised eyebrow ]
176205764,What do you mean by lack of understanding in spiritual ways? Spiruality can mean different things for different people
176205765,That’s an unsustainable rate of weight loss. Listen to yourself and be kind to yourself.
174395124,No. I don’t mind being called a schizophrenic. I don’t think it should be demeaning. It’s not different than calling someone a diabetic. Both are diseases which require treatment. I understand there is _USER_ID_ behind the name. But I think we need to change that by not feeling ashamed about our illness.
176205766,"I think it depends upon the job to some extent. It might be acceptable at some jobs, but other jobs it might not."
174395135,"I have used two supplements with great success to help me quiet voices. Niacin which I take 500mg/day and vitamin D which I take 5000 IU/day. Takes a little while before it kicks in though, but it gradually got better for me. After being on it for a month I feel like I’m pretty much in control of my own thoughts."
176205767,Looks great! Nice job.
176205769,Thanks for the reply. I had a haemorrhoid that bled. My doctor has looked at it and has said I definitely have a haemorrhoid and that’s more than likely where the bleeding came from. Thanks for the welcome!
176205770,Do you define it in terms of behavior like having the house and chores in order or do you define it by something emotional like a desire in yourself to be reliable?

176205772,"When I was young, I liked rock, pop, r&b, Mexican folk, and opera. Then I got a bit older and added rap to the mix, then country, then jazz. Now that I am really old, I only like to listen to traditional and contemporary classical music."
176205773,_AT_MENTION_ you get to be the “bad guy” and keep the rest of us in line cause y’all have level heads lol
176205774,I hear them every day.
176205775,"Energy is not really the problem it’s more apathy, sexual dysfunction, boredom, slow thoughts, bad motor skills and no emotions."

176205777,the best psychiatrist I ever had told me herbs were a no no for schizophrenics…
176205778,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ You have helped by talking to me as I really don’t know what to do
174395119,"Did you read the recent letter that the FDA is refusing to write a letter approving the claim that vraylar is useful in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. They are saying there isn’t sufficient data to prove that it does indeed help negative symptoms. I didn’t know if you were aware of this. Hopefully they will collect more data over time. This may be why your psychiatrist isn’t thinking that it will take care of your negative symptoms, in your doctors defense."
176205779,"I knew it wasnt a good place. I knew bad things happened. I just dont think I ever saw it like that. I could dissociate from gunshots in the middle of the night. It’s simply someone shooting a target. I could dissociate drug baggies at the bus stop. I’m only in 5th grade so these little bags have nothing to do with me. I could dissociate cops with assault rifles and k9 units. The bad man just came through, hes gone and they just wanna make sure he isnt there. I could dissociate drunks stumbling into our house. They’re just drunk and dad is here so its okay. I guess that event was too much. It broke through everything, all of my insensible rationales. I cant dissociate from what is right in front of me."
176205780,"No. They make up stories to make me look stupid, that are supposed to explain why I did, what someone else actually did."
176205781,"I talk about family, stress, emotions, and my day to day life. We don’t go into my past because I’m, as my therapist put it, a very now&future oriented person."
176205782,"I’m not sure, some will due to having normal situations before the voices start up, as so not to bring attention, I was already on the crap pile so did not have too."
174395138,"Thank you!!! and for sure!! Might want to see a therapist instead, psychiatrists rush you into the medication too soon imo. Don’t listen very much even if the issues are incredibly complicated."

176205785,"Drugs are probably essential as a start but, Ways of treating delusions might be Humming, chanting and other vocal cord activities may prevent the production of voices. Searching on these forums to see if one’s “delusion” is unique or common, where common should imply that it is a delusion. Being treated as a shamanistic advise giver, as seems to have been, or may have been, the case in Okinawa, southern Japan. Life threatening illness/near death experience. This is utterly hearsay but a psychological doctor claimed that life threatening illness induced near death experience had resulted in an end to voices. ."
176205786,That’s good. :).
176205787,It does have a bit of children’s book motif to it!
176205788,"I’m sorry your Mom said bad stuff to you that caused hurt. _PERSON_, I felt extremely unwanted, until I got married at 33 y.o. I saw myself about as useful as a pile of crap. But people didn’t dare try to screw me over b/c my anger level was so high that I scared people away. Which fed my feeling of being unwanted. Words do matter. I felt unwanted b/c I was told that I “was an accident” and that I “should have been a boy.” I just thought my parents cared for me b/c “what would the neighbors say if they didn’t?” My parents seemed to be more concerned about what the neighbors were saying than what I had to say. Turns out my parents were great after I grew up and moved out. They just didn’t like kids."
176205789,Strange Topic Headline
176205790,I finally figured out what you have to do _AT_MENTION_!
176205791,I am still in bed all day.
176205792,Meds are also takes time to really start working once taken regularly without breaks. Good luck with your appointment.
176205793,Good work! I transferred out of community college a couple years ago. I’m planning on applying to grad school in probably a year. School is fun but I can’t wait to get to work.
176205794,I don’t know why I snap at my wife
174395130,"I just felt sometimes I got motivation to do things,and things are on my way.Sometimes it’s so hard like I restarted every hard work that I have had done"
176205795,"if she has come to this conclusion , she is telling you what she thinks you’re struggling with , she knows more about you than we do"
176205796,"Your other thread proves to us that you are sz _AT_MENTION_. I use to be a bit of a med sceptic, it took me until I had no symptoms anymore to realize that I still needed them. Even if you did not have voices or delusions (which you do by the way) , you would still need meds."
176205797,"Although I often feel exhausted after irl socialising, I feel it is worth it and necessary"
176205798,Commonly asked questions by those who are ill and those questions will lead you nowhere. Some people have the belief that the world is going to end every other week and these people live in constant fear. Maybe there is a one in a bazillion chance that the world WILL end next week. But what good is it to worry constantly about this one in a bazillion chance? Better questions to ask are “How do these beliefs benefit me? How do these beliefs make me feel? Are these beliefs ones that I want to keep?” Ultimately the fear of not believing in those things comes down to the thought that not believing them will put you in danger somehow. So ask yourself “what would it take for me to feel safe?”
176205799,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. I hope you can recover the receipts. Some places keep that on record, like Best Buy. Regardless I’m sorry you’re having so much trouble. That really sucks!"
176205800,"_AT_MENTION_ Only 5’5"" I am still considered to be at an overweight BMI at 160 pounds, but it would take way too much work to get lower. I’m not even sure I can get TO 160, but I will try! We’ll see what my body wants to do. I am not going to freak out if I can’t get below 170. Like I told you earlier on this thread, if your body fights you that hard, maybe you are already at your ideal weight. I am just guessing at my goal weight. I haven’t been under 200 pounds since September 1993! And 170 beats the hell out of 319 where I started!"
176205801,What country do you live in _AT_MENTION_? I forgot
176205802,My daughter is a sociopath. It’s hard loving one.
176205803,"Yes, I’m sure it was the beef that did it."
176205804,The 6 years sober I’m happy about and the 6 years out of hospital is just a fun fact really. I credit A.A. with the 6 years sober. I had to get help as I couldn’t quit on my own and I got lucky and they helped. When I went to them I thought alcohol was worth dying for. I started A.A. in 2003 but got drunk 6 years ago. I’d love to make it to 10 years sober.
176205805,"I don’t moisturise my face, it just clogs my pores I might need to consider a cleansing creamer at some point depending on how essential moisturising is. idk…"
176205806,"They offer therapy for free (5 sessions) but not psychiatry. Luckily my insurance says they’ll reimburse 80% of the cost, so that leaves me paying $60 a month assuming I go monthly. Still a lot but at least I’ll hit my deductible sooner"
176205807,Play videogames? Netflix? Cook?
176205808,It had been since Tuesday. I was stinky. Now I’m smelling like a rosebud. I don’t know why it’s so hard. I always feel so much better afterwards. I was in the habit of doing it every other day but I’m just not as comfortable here for some reason. Maybe I’ll get back in a good habit when I get my own apartment.
176205809,"_PERSON_ idk i just feel really bad about my self, like low self esteem. _PERSON_ i ate candy and some cookies last night."
174395136,Maybe make some plans for the weekend so you don’t have time on your hands. I honestly use to obsess about suicide until I started taking Rexulti. It was awful so I really feel for you. It’s such a negative head space to be in. I hope you can find some relief soon.
176205810,i allways think of it as who is pulling my wagon now. and who is pushing it. …alcoholic are people head for a horrible death. lost friends i know. please find your self free.

176205816,"I was 40 when I entered the group home. 45 when I left. I never think of it as a negative, bad experience It was just the way my life was going at the time. Hell, in a lot of ways it was good for me. The owners ran it good. Basically we had very few responsibilities. The owners cooked and fed us, our only responsibility was to make our bed each morning and keep our little area clean and neat. They hired a cleaning lady (who my friend there slept with, lol ) come on weekends and cleaned and helped cook. Anyways, I saw you mention a group home as a possibility and I just wanted to say, they are not necessarily bad places. We had a lot of freedom there."
176205817,I go to bed at 7 pm.
176205818,Good job _AT_MENTION_ ! It’s hard to stick to something when you feel like you’re terrible at it. And now you’re doing good because of it :). So cool! I haven’t managed that in my life. So way to go!

176205823,Does anybody get tired because of antipsychotic meds while excercising.
176205824,"Is it your therapist or your pdoc who is doubting your diagnosis? If its the therapist it means nothing, just forget it and listen to your pdoc."
176205825,"Thats normal, its called the honeymoon period. I also experienced it when stopping meds. But after sometime, maybe a few days or maybe a few weeks, you’ll start to have psychosis. You feel good bcz of the dopamine rush that occurs after lvl of meds in the blood decrease. Dopamine makes us feel good. Street drugs also boost dopamine to cause euphoria which causes addiction. I think thats why its hard to get back on meds once you experienced the euphoria while being off meds."
176205826,i voted yes cause you have to go in traffic so much to go get the depot but if you would be able to get the depot at home then i’d vote no. Here my gp doc comes to give me my depot every 2 weeks. Maybe you can do something like that too?

176205849,So you haven’t made a single mistake since you became aware of these men? What about mistakes made before you ever saw them? Surely you would’ve been tortured by now? And what happens if you do whatever “messing up” means on purpose? It can’t be a mistake if it was intentional.

176205866,"There is infinite manifestations of life, we only ever see part of it, a finite part at that, quantised into finitely many living beings. This is because some forms of life are travelling faster than light. Light speed is not the absolute limit, it is just the limit of what we can perceive with our five senses. Even with six senses we can only perceive in part. Perception is always partial. Yet there is life everywhere. The balance between life forms is different in different dimensions, suffering is skewed differently, and we can move into such dimensions. Thus within the infiniteness of reality, though there is infinite suffering there is also infinite joy. Some people seek out sufferers, some people seek out joyous people, there is always a balance in perception between sufferers and those who experience joy. Realising that there are infinite sufferers and infinite people experiencing joy means that we have no duty to seek out either, indeed it is a sign of arrogance to believe in such duty. “
Why not help one another along the way” as _NAME_ sang, sure, but do not fool yourself that suffering will ever cease being infinite, nor that there isn’t infinite joy to explore. Thank you."

176205868,"Yes. I hang on to electronics because I, “might need something later.” I’ve got boxes of tubes in a shed back on the farm for kit that I don’t own and won’t ever own.

Just want to keep the ones that have emotional significance now. I think what hurt the most was getting rid of all of my darkroom kit. Spent years building it up. At least I found a museum that would adopt it rather than just tossing it."

I noticed even higher doses can have beneficial effects like less symptoms and more motivation if done correctly. Doctor even admitted this."

176205887,I was up to 230 but lost most of it and now I’m down to 170 from smoking pot. It takes away all my depression and makes my voices more cheerful than sinister. My pdoc gave the go ahead to continue as long as my regular meds are working well. No weird delusions at all aside from what is normal for me on meds. I got off probation and dropped 50 pounds in 6 months but I’m stuck at 170 to 180. I used to be 125 but I doubt I’ll ever see that weight again

That was one thing I talked about yesterday, I am having a hard time finding a healthy outlet that lets me escape.

174395145,"I have just been intermediary to my father and mum, in getting £1,500 a week for my sister at a private treatment facility… which will cover her costs 50:50 for private treatment. (My sister is selling her London flat)… she is schizophrenic with huge suicidal depression severe bulimia, anxiety disorder, unstable personality disorder, p.t.s.d. Late stage alcoholism… and has never come close in 8 years to speak to a therapist, doctor, self help group, psychiatrist, peer, She has been trying so hard to get well in the past 6 months, after all of us fearing we would find her dead at any given moment, or never find her. The place treats trauma, psychosis, addiction, all in one place The only philosophy my sister has ever said, on reading about their approach and types of treatment, ah yes that sounds like how it is with me. I was copied to an email, where my father said about how he had been in touch with my sister, saying that he wanted very much to help… and was wondering if he, on a white ch
arger, could pay for private Therapy because she clearly needed help. He probably wanted to suggest about £45 a week. I was blunt, almost to the point of rude. I disclosed things my mum had spent 8 years trying to hide and keep from him. And said that 25, 30 or 40 thousand would be appropriate At the moment mum is talking to my sister about immediately getting her admitted. I don’t dare make a subject heading for fear she might see it… Just to add her trauma has been so severe and she was so young. I know it’s a lot of money, mum has been crippling herself caring for 8 years originally in a one bed flat, sleeping in a chair for 3 years to give her space… they moved to a 2 bed. The extent of her spending on herself is a cheap pair of trainers and a duvet cover, in a year. She is paying an extra £60 a week at least that ends up in the loo So in debt My sister had to sell her flat to cover the debts Sorry I know it’s a privileged amount of money There hasn’t been much happiness Feeling good to get 
money out of my father though… mum would never have dared to ask Finally… She has agreed to go in and they are talking on the phone right now Not the same as accepting medication yet but I know if she even gives it a chance they will advise"
176205894,Assume it stops my phone going off as well? Nice to be mentioned - but i get em at 2am in the morning sometimes lol.
174395163,What dose of Klozapol (Clozapine) are you on? The max dose is 900mg I think.
176205895,No it doesn’t bother me because I can understand - I went off meds myself and can sympathise with others wanting to do the same. Although most of the time it’s not a good idea.

176205909,"Hollywood always puts some kind of spin on mental health movies for dramatic effects. I just recently watched Words on Bathroom Walls, mainly because it was so recommended on this forum. It turned out to be a disappointment. A love story mixed with unrealistic visual hallucinations. But there’s no real incentive to make a movie about someone who listens to auditory hallucinations sporadically, or who puts aluminum foil over their windows to block out alien signals. Leave it to Hollywood to make something mundane into something unrealistic."
176205910,Yes the meds will make you sleepy during the day for awhile. It went away for me but I switched anyways to taking it all at night because I wanted better sleep.

174395164,"Being pre-occupied with sz is not healthy. To move on you have to accept it, and then make room for other things in your life I was written off, and they were going to pension me off on benefits and give me a place to live. It was literally all setup and ready to go, when I pulled out of it, and discharged myself from the care of the CMHT and the agency that was supposed to give me housing. The choice I made was to work, because I had been jobless for 6 months around diagnosis, and I hated it so much, as I was switched off and a zombie. You’re all capable of doing something, you just need to enable it. Obsessing over Schizophrenia is not going to get you anywhere, and the doctrine of mental health professionals to keep you compliant and importantly, not disruptive, is their primary goal. I am glad I rejected the life they wanted me to lead, as I’d be in a home with nothing to do but make myself sicker and sicker. Boredom kicks in very swiftly for me"

I still can’t replace smoking with something more healthy or productive that keeps me busy all day. I will try in the future to quit. Because I alaways try to quit. Kind of not willing to quit, it’s just like a little brain fart that comes sometimes."
176205933,"I’m not sure because the high you get from Working out is not a bad thing usually. It’s an all natural release of endorphins and it’s supposed to be a great mood boost and stuff. The year I was off meds I did no drugs, a little alcohol, but nothing else, and I worked out for three hours per day. This allowed me to stay off meds longer than normal until I got hospitalized as I think working out is good for mental health but not all you need. Are you overdoing it??? Maybe u are and your body can’t handle it and it’s telling you to calm it down a little. Idk. That’s my only guess I got maybe someone else has something better."

176205939,Life is meant to be full of experiences. Good and Bad. If you didnt have the bad stuff - you would’nt be able to compare the good. Happiness comes from suffering. Only when you suffer - do you learn and gain experience. Thats whats life about.

176205942,Youre being unreasonable in my opinion. You want to take off meds when your doctor clearly states that you need medication. We have given the answers you dont want to hear
176205943,I’m proud of how far I’ve come with all that’s gone on and is going on in my life/the world at large.
176205944,Its all about iq. The psychiatrist think they are more intelligent to control.
174395169,"Just adding my opinion here but going off meds to feel better is like turning up the heater on a hot day because you can’t stand the heat. You’re just going to make yourself feel worse, do more damage to your brain, your judgement, and take the easy train to wreck. That said, I’m mildly having positive symptoms and I’m not treating it. It’s not really that strong, though…"
176205945,"And all people do, is sit around lying about me. When I just woke up, someone’s shouting things about me in the street. They do illegal things to me all the time. The people who do the things, they lie about, are obsessed with abusing me, or looking like a saint at my expense. They mostly want to cause problems for people."
176205946,"If you fight it when it is strong and refuse to smoke the desire will go away and you will have hours of freedom from it. Breathe the air , enjoy the air it is stronger than smoke. Take a walk and the desire will subside some, air is the cure."
176205947,I hate alcohol too. It just gives me migraines. My sister says its because I gulp it down too fast. She says you’re supposed to sip.
176205948,Ever since being on meds I have noticed that I cant run fast or asfar as I used to do before. Is this a side effect of the medication or the actual psychosis itself with the slow movements and all.

176205959,Whilst pondering how to make my life more fulfilling I have to underline that I am always grateful not to be in work 9 to 5.

Some things have gone wrong in the past, and I fear they will go wrong again.

174395191,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Childhood trauma is associated with poorer social functioning in severe mental disorders both during an active illness phase and in remission. _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, OA _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ Aas, Schizophrenia research, Mar 25 2020 Impaired social functioning is a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum (SZS) and bipolar spectrum disorders (BDS). Childhood traumatic events are more frequent in SZS and BDS than in healthy individuals (HC), and could represent a cumulative risk for reduced social functioning beyond experiencing ongoing clinical symptoms.The study comprised 1039 individuals (SZS [n = 348]; BDS [n = 262], and HC [n = 429]). Childhood trauma and level of social functioning was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Social Functioning Scale (SFS), respectively. Diagnosis was obtained by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV).Patients had 
poorer social functioning (F = 819.18, p ? 0.001, _PERSON_ d = 0.44) and reported more childhood trauma experiences than HC (X2 = 289.0, p < .001) than HC. Patients with at least one moderate to severe trauma had poorer social functioning than patients without childhood trauma (F = 8.16, p = .004, _PERSON_ d = 0.17). Within the patients, a cumulative relationship was observed in that more severe childhood trauma was associated with lower social functioning (F = 2.65, p = .02, _PERSON_ d = 0.20). No significant associations were observed for having at least one moderate to severe trauma or cumulative traumas on social functioning in the HC. Follow-up analysis showed that patients in remission childhood trauma also had poorer social functioning.Patients who reported childhood trauma experiences had poorer social functioning both during an active illness phase and in remission."

176206048,"Well. It started a year ago but the family is distancing themselves from me. It’s just an expression, I’m not comparing them to actual rats. But I have to take responsibility for my part of it. I think it actually started in 2002 when my sisters ex-husband hired me to watch my 12 year old nephew after he got out of school. Make sure he did his homework, chores and then keep him entertained. But he was at a bad age and not only did he show zero respect but he tried to bully me.I couldn’t (didn’t want) to put up with him and walked out one day and never answered his numerous phone calls until he gave up trying to reach me. My real dad died 13 years ago. He was my biggest supporter, he was always there for me and we talked on the phone at least once every two weeks for the last twenty years of his life. I miss him a lot, he was a good guy and we got along great. My mom died in 2015, I miss her too. I didn’t handle her death well and two days after she died I ended up in the psyche ward feeli
ng suicidal after staying out 25 years. I still talk to my step mom but I haven’t driven the 200 miles to see her in person. My sisters have things against her but have driven to see her a couple times and all three of us met about halfway to Sacramento where she lives to celebrate Mothers Day about four times. So losing that relationship is my fault. And I shouldn’t have faulted my nephew so much, and just swallowed my pride but now it’s way to late. My step-dad is a long story. When he first married my mom there were accusations from a long time family friend that he was beating her. Well, I trusted him and believed him when he denied it, even ten years later when I (and my sisters)realized he was a bully and soon also discovered he was a total control freak. Then two years after my mom died he started dating. Which was fine. Except that his girlfriend was a frail 90 year old women. My step-dad used to drive 175 miles to pick me up and we would visit my mom’s grave and then go out to lunch afterward
s. We had some good talks and then the situation with the daughters escalated. The police got involved. He told me all this at lunch one day. Then he casually told me the daughters were accusing him of beating their mother. This turned out to be a bombshell but the first 60 seconds I automatically thought he was innocent. He said it so casually like there was no way he did it. And I believed him-- at first. But I couldn’t control what I thought. I thought, “Wait a minute. Two wives in a row? All these people accusing him was too big a coincidence.” I then had to think, if he was guilty, why would he bring it up himself? I thought, is he just so arrogant that he thinks I’ll automatically believe him? Is he so confident that he thinks I’m stupid or something that I won’t doubt his innocence? And at lunch he looked like he really regretted telling me. I won’t go further into it except due to how things played out, me and my sisters are pretty sure he was guilty with both my mom and this new wife. A
nd it was so awkward every time I saw him after that. Well, he’s married again but he barely communicates with us anymore. I think he realized he made a big mistake and for all I know, he’s beating this new wife. And I realized that it’s just something that me and my sisters don’t talk about and I realize my sisters are pretending everything is fine and that our relationship with my step dad is fine and he’ s just too busy to send us a 5 minute email. In the last 9 months he’s sent like maybe four emails and I’ve known him for more than thirty years. Oh well. To wind this up, I haven’t heard a word from my older nephew and his wife, no Christmas card, no phone call. So I can read the writing on the wall. I know my sister has problems with him and his wife too. But it looks like our relationship is shot. My oldest sister just moved to Mexico, I just barely mentioned it last week. So basically, all I have is my middle sister. We get along good luckily but I’ve been alienating people lately and 
worry I’ll drive her away. I get along fine in life, I go to my job, I have been taking care of myself for the past 25 years. I know how to survive. But in the area of people I’ve slipped. I should be getting along fine with my therapist and case manager but there are issues. Are relationships aren’t horrible or terrible but they don’t call when they should. I can see it’s going to take work on my part to reach out to them. My shrink is OK, I’ve only seen him for short phone calls every six weeks. So yeah, it ain’t time to panic but I need to stop taking the easy way out and start reaching out to people again. It’s too easy to lay on the couch on my computer for hours and not put out any effort to mingle with people in my life. The ball’s in my court, it’s up to me to “seize the day” and salvage my support system. It’s sad about family, I never would have guessed it would end up like this but life has ways of throwing you a curve ball."

I am trying to get contact with old friends but they ignore me and seem to want nothing to do with me . I know some friends I had over 16 years ago didn’t want to be my friends because I didn’t work (and I still don’t) . One guy I wasn’t there for him when his mum died because I didn’t comprehend it and forgot about it so I was a bad friend. I don’t have friends as such. No friends I can chat with. No friends I can hang out with. It sucks but I’m socially awkward and complicated so it’s difficult for me to make new friends and I couldn’t keep the friends I had. I was a bad person though. I was a sl ut , binge drinker etc I have improved myself but still don’t have friends . I have my sacred neigh. I have family. I like to believe I h

Who cares if I’m a sim? There’s nothing I can do about it. It’s weird because after I started to see it that way, the show lost its grip on me. They stopped watching, it stopped airing. Then I began to wonder if there had ever been a show. Now, I’m pretty sure there never was. Yet it was definitely an eye opener on how I want people to perceive me. I try hard to be nice, say the right things, but I’m also not afraid of living. I think that’s what it was before, I was scared of living."

Then she suggested I start back with my old therapist instead and that she would check to see if she had any openings. Well things didn’t end well with my old therapist and I think she didn’t want me back so the supervisor got stuck with me when she really didn’t have time for me and didn’t really want me in the first place, probably because of our history.

I have had my psychiatrist retire after knowing him for 15 years, and it took 6 months for a new replacement to be found and I had to see a locum. My case worker left the mental health service, and I was with her for four years and it took a few changes before that settled down again - perhaps a year? Now today my psychologist who I have seen on and off for three years told me today she is retiring in October. Might not see her again due to Covid-19 I don’t know if I have just been lucky to have had the same people to deal with for extended periods of time. That’s probably why it affects me so much. How consistent are the people you deal with in Mental Health?"

Research is still ongoing, but -- as far as depression goes -- ketamine is proving to be an extremely promising therapeutic agent. “The idea is, if one part of the brain contributes to the beneficial effects of ketamine, and another part contributes to its abuse and effects such as hallucinations, now we can come up with medications to target the good part and not the bad,” _USER_ID_, an assistant professor at University of Texas San _NAME_, said in a statement. “We’re working on testing compounds that more selectively target the hippocampus and we and others actually found and published that such compounds recapitulate the beneficial effects of ketamine without the abuse liability, without the psychotomimetic effects,” _PERSON_ told ZME Science."

No one is going to take the meds for you, and no one is going to know what is really going on. Even the psychiatrist does not have the “all-seeing eye”. You need to communicate as much ‘necessary’ information to the right people (doctors) as possible. If you feel like this right now then it means you have nowhere to go but up! That’s the good news.

176206209,"Reading sexual harassment news articles have helped me hate sex. Years ago, I first started reading them after I’ve been accused of sexual misconduct on many websites. I decided to read news articles on sexual harassment, to understand it better. Not only did I learn about unforgivable sex crimes, but also men like me who were accused of sex crimes. Today I read an article about a home invader who attacked a lady and her 5-year old daughter at her home. There was also some other article about a rapper’s brother who attacked a little girl when her parents were at work. Then another article was of a man who flashed a little girl on a train. I try to avoid the kid-attacker articles because that’s not really an issue for me. I try to focus more on news articles about adult victims. But I feel that I live in a society where adult rape victims are sometimes ignored or suppressed because it doesn’t want to antagonize sex. If the society antagonizes sex, then men won’t likely have sex and then ch
ildren may not be produced to secure the society’s future. Of course I don’t believe this because I don’t believe that humans are solely spawned by humans. I believe that some other Higher Power governs that. I used to find a lot of article about men who attacked women, especially involving alcohol. These news articles have also taught me to avoid alcohol, even though I’ve never drank before. I don’t think that I’ll ever visit a bar. But anyhow, the articles stopped surfacing. Maybe the news articles were convincing men to stop having sex, and some societies saw this as an issue. Some newspaper businesses are connected with the government or receive government or political funding, after all. And it’s illegal to publish libelous claims, so newspapers can be halted on suspicion of libel, where I live. Other times, gangs and people attack newspaper companies directly. But I hate sex. I’ve determined that the foundation for sex crimes is sex. As long as sex exists, sex crimes will exist and crimi
nals will use sex as an excuse. And as long as some societies depend on sex for human resources, then sex will exist. I feel a lot of sex crime victims have been dismissed on the grounds of “consensual sex” which may have been founded by a bias legal official. Some political figures have the power to pardon rapists completely. This might change though: women were not allowed to have jobs in the past, but women are slowly being employed, even in the judicial branch of government. There are even some women fighting in the army nowadays, where before they would’ve been barred from serving! I still might want to care for a kid, in the future. So I might invest in artificial insemination, surrogacy, adoption, reproductive technology, and etc. Taking care of a kid might be a two-person job, but I hate sex and not parenting. So I can probably secure a girlfriend to help me raise the kid. I will try to avoid marriage because I don’t like the idea of binding a woman to life via such contract. In Christianity, 
marriage is a serious thing that can get a lady killed for several reasons. I don’t like the idea of securing a girlfriend because a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship culturally puts sexual pressure on the lady, where I live. But beggars can’t be choosers, and hopefully I’ll think of another way to support a kid, before I actually secure a kid. Like I could probably get my brother to help out with funds and etc."

Fear has been a major part of keeping me from changing my situation even though I’m not happy in it. I’d like to move to a new city, but my family has been a support although not the best but I’m scared to be completely on my own. Also, finding and keeping a job has been hard for me. It’s a risk, and risks are scary. But if you do go on your own, think of all the good things of having your own space. maybe that can help mitigate some of the fear and lack of motivation"

176206227,"Boredom probably, wanting the rush. Any of the hallucinogens, I’m craving the trip. Dangerous thoughts, hate this feeling. I’m counting the minutes right now, sitting with my mom, calm tea. Writing my way through it, trying to use my tools. It’s strange, I know doing it would be disastrous, would hurt my relationships, would trigger me, but man it sounds so good. Romanticizing the ritual and experience, need to cut that out. Need to remember the cult was a bad thing. I tried to do good, but it ended badly. Tbh I wonder how much of my visual hallucinations are to blame on the disease, or the drug abuse. It’s all kind of foggy anymore. 8-9 years off the drugs, succumbed to the idea that I’ll always get cravings from time to time, but it’s what I do with those urges that defines the experience. I don’t want to slip. I’ve failed in the past with temptation. Given in. I should always know better. Once I start I can’t stop, one beer and I’m chugging vodka next minute. One puff and I

176206256,"All my case managers had something to offer. My first one was very dedicated to keeping me from experiencing really bad symptoms and always had tips on how to get by, supportive and easy to contact if I had an emergency. If she cancelled, she always rescheduled and made it appoint to bring me places that I had to go since I don’t drive so I could get things done. She really understood me. Now my new one isn’t involved in my life at all, I had to rely on a CPS to try to accomplish goals but she triggered me and I cut ties with her since I was having too many symptoms to see her 3 times a week. So I know what you mean but not ALL case managers are bad."

176206268,The first thing that strikes me is that is much more relaxing because only police and army are allowed to carry firearms. I think it would stress me out living in a country where everyone carries. (I live in Norway) Civilians are not even allowed to carry sharp objects in public. Ofcourse if there was a threat of a coup that would be a bad thing. But western Europe is very democratic and the people who live in the countries are bonded together. There is very little corruption compared to other parts of the world.

174395275,Aripiprazole is barely affective. It only helps schizophrenics with mild symptoms. I take medium risperidone dose and works magic. Talk with your doctor about adding a small doze of antipsychotics to your first AP. My paranoia was gone the second I took a pill.
176206284,I don’t know if I was well or not when I wrote the threat online also minors can end up in jail too

176206291,Yes its the problem with AP and other medications. Its hard to lower dose or go back to weaker AP as body get used to it. This is why careful AP selection and dose is very important.
176206292,No problem _AT_MENTION_ . Sometimes side issues dominate a topic on this site. It’s part of the illness we have.

I do have Mind over Mood but haven’t got around to reading it yet. What’s the take-home message?"

I’ve been schizophrenia for 17 years, and I have to remind myself that working was what triggered the illness. Some people are OK with working, while others struggle. Maybe it’s just work ethic. I don’t have any work ethic, maybe. I feel painful commuting to the office and sitting in the office. The noise in my office makes it difficult to concentrate, making my brain feel very cluttered.

I was in and out of inpatient psychiatric hospitals every two weeks like a revolving door all of that time. I was put on a million different AD’s and mood stabilizers and none of them worked. I was at my wits end. Then, in 2005, I got God. I also finally fell out of love with my ex husband. I had been pining after him for years and years, and this was my main source of extreme grief. In addition, in 2005, my father apologized to me for his incest of me when I was a child. I had been begging for his apology for years. These three events led to the complete and total lifting of my suicidal depression. I have been completely depression free, and perfectly content and happy ever since the year 2005.

176206350,"I have to be assessed today. I don’t know if this person will end up referring me to another therapist or if this will be my therapist. I do know they will be referring me over to my new pdoc. So that’s a good thing. I’m still getting refills from my old pdoc in the town I used to live in 3 months ago and I’m sure they’re getting sick of prescribing for me without exams. I’m nervous, I hate assessments. It always feels like opening up a can of worms to talk about my history what with the early childhood abuse and my bad choices as a teen and in my twenties. I always kind of feel like a failure after I get assessed, like no wonder I’m not successful. Oh well, it is what it is. I’m a kind person and at least I can say that much."
176206351,sex is the least of my problems.its the dyskisina that pisses me off.
176206352,The new pdoc now says just take the sertraline … as im not dealing with any mania but I keep a look out …
176206353,I wouldn’t of been able to get it without use of my Barclaycard credit card…
176206354,"Hey _PERSON_. You survived. That is the important thing here. We all have our dark momenta. But you got the chance to do the next right thing, and take responsibility for your actions. You took steps to prevent a repeat of the incident. Many hugs to you. You’re a good egg, and I’m sorry you have been suffering so badly."
174395308,"I have a problem that I feel like is unique to me, but I’m not sure, so I’m reaching out. For a career, I want to be an author. This has been my ideal job since I was 11. I love books and stories and want to create them. Naturally, this means I have to practice writing so I can get good enough at it to get published, and this is where my schizophrenia ruins everything. I’ve only started writing my first short story last year, at age 19, and I still haven’t finished it. Most writers I see started writing when they were kids, but I couldn’t work up the courage because of my delusions. I think people are watching me constantly, like a reality show, and that includes watching me write. I was too terrified to ever write anything from when I decided I wanted to write until when I finally started a story because I felt like said people would judge me, and now when I do write I’m dealing with constant fear while doing it. I do have a decent amount of insight into my delusion, and it’s progres
sed to the point where I can challenge it by writing, but the paranoia is still there and makes the process slow and mentally painful. I seriously don’t know anyone that writes as slowly as me, it takes me an hour to get out an average of 100 or less words. I’m happy that I can at least challenge my fear, but my progress feels so slow and it’s so upsetting. It doesn’t help that my voices comment on what I write, usually something mean, and I take that as the people watching me commenting on what I’m writing. So, what I want to ask is are there any other writers here that deal with something like this? I feel even crazier than I normally do because I know of no writers that have this problem."
176206355,"_AT_MENTION_ I struggle with the same thing! I was listening to the Grateful Dead yesterday and _NAME_ said to me, “I’ve got news for you. The stars will never align perfectly.” I assume he was talking about my love life?? Oh well. I’m not joking either."
176206356,_AT_MENTION_ Good for you! Big successes start with one good decision! I am down three more pounds. 105 total and 54 since starting Zyprexa.

176206360,"I slept good last night, but in the morning I woke up feeling so confused. I don’t know why."
176206361,I dont want to do that though. I used to do that and I ended up friendless and hating myself. Plus I dont want to lose this group of friends. Plus they don’t know I’m _PERSON_ or DID so I’m sorry but I think thats a bad idea I dont want to add to _USER_ID_ and make our community look bad
176206362,I think it’s waiting till someone else posts. I get that in the music thread sometimed.

176206366,I take 5 prescriptions. Two antipsychotics. I take the maximum recommended dose of Geodon plus a small dose of Latuda. I have been hospitalized inpatient 4 times. My wife swears it was 7 but I think she can’t count.
176206367,My stomach really hurts right now.
176206368,As in you’re not paying attention to what’s being communicated but only focusing on what’s being said literally
176206369,"I’m tired so I’ll take a nap, No I’ll have a coffee and stay up, I bravely face difficult decisions Like this everyday."
174395301,Eat plenty of broccoli. Preferably raw. Apparently it is good for us szcs
176206370,"At first,I checked and in my dictionary said “credulous”.I like the poem."
176206371,"As you age, it’s normal to have a few extra pounds on you. As you get an adult body, you fill out more so maybe trying to get to a weight from when you were a kid is unrealistic."
176206372,"Yes… every time i have a breakdown, depression or psychosis, I feel more stupid for a long period. Now i have just begun to take a MAO-inhibitor which increase dopamine and that helps decreasing my cognitive decline - but like _AT_MENTION_ wrote, too much dopamine can do as much damage as too little."
176206373,Does it cost money?
176206374,Sometimes when I’m manic or hypo-manic I get really irritable and easily agitated. I also anger easily.
176206375,Hungry people………….
176206376,Reduce for now.
176206377,"Well _AT_MENTION_, that is one very interesting story. As you explained it I felt myself being drawn into it deeper and deeper. Very creative! Thanks for sharing."
176206378,Yesh. Dislike is a very draining energy. When I am happy with myself I won’t have that much of a care to dislike some1 so intensely.
176206379,_AT_MENTION_ hope you feel better soon. Our we at a full moon again? _AT_MENTION_ I will put music on in a bit - thanks for suggesting it
176206380,The feeling that you have is correct I am not questioning that but it’s not externally induced it’s got something to do with our own thinking
174395311,I resonate with you. I also don’t exactly know who I am. I wish you all the best!
176206381,How did you relapse? Your meds stopped working without changing them or their dosage?
176206382,"Yes, we can’t really be sure what is going on. She says she lied about it, but maybe she just can’t face it and wants to think she did."
176206383,"I’m almost a year off meds as well. No symptoms whatsoever. I live a normal life. I do have beliefs on aliens, Serpents, higher dimensions, God, consciousness etc, but these are just speculative theories. And many others share my beliefs. Hopefully I won’t descend into psychosis again, but I do wonder if the meds that were injected into me can store some kind of dormant chemical inside my body (perhaps in adipose tissue? idk), and once they are released, I will go bananas again. I’m a man of science, but pharmaceutical companies ultimate goal is money, power and control. They are run by Satanic individuals. Aps gave me blurred vision and terrible intrusive thought panic attacks, plus anxiety. Luckily all that stuff subsided 3 months after coming off meds last year. I wish you all the best."
176206384,"I go to bed at irregular hours, anything from 10pm to 3am, but I usually get up around 7 monday-friday. During weekends I tend to let loose and catch up on sleep and just wake up whenever my body feels like it, usually around 11am."
176206385,Are there any positives from being in this relationship? Do you think you can both work together to make the relationship worthwhile? If the answer is no to both of these then I would divorce.
176206386,i dont mean everyone
176206387,"I laugh at the crap I did all the time, and its usually only to amuse me."
176206388,"Presentation means you put emotion into the reality of the product. If someone is serving you a meal, the way it is presented has a lot to do with your enjoying it. Presentation is creating a positive atmosphere. Salesmen work very hard on their presentation because it boosts sales."
176206389,I almost always post in lounge unless it’s about art so I am happy with the drop down list…
176206390,All through grade school: They’re called ‘Teachers’.
176206391,"i do jump alot when i hear a loud sound have u considered this sensitivity as myoclonic jerks, its a type of seizure"
176206392,If you’re deluded enough you can think you’re in bliss sitting in a bath full of dung.
176206393,"I think _PERSON_ was the best president in history. He was our fairest, most honest, least racist, even tempered, selfless president ever. And he didn’t let his ego get in the way when there was an important decision to be made. And his hair was cool."
174395317,"I did part of the course while on Abilify. My brother is an IT, he’s working in a big IT company here and makes 100K/year."
176206394,When I had voices 24/7 I also heard moanes and I used to have spontaneous orgasms without madturbation or touch . I hated these orgasms because I thought I was feeling my soul mates orgasms while he had sex with other’s. I had them often but did not want them. Thankfully the voices and spontaneously unwanted orgasms went away
174395309,"Well it’s easy to do things that you still consider easy. Such as laying in bed, reading articles, gaming. All easy things for you still (for now). Maybe you get better maybe worse who knows. Do you ever try to do one difficult thing a day? Like training yourself to do things you would consider difficult. Like set 1 task a day that’s outside of your norm. Don’t let your mindset forever become “I’m brain damaged I can’t do anything anymore” I spent most of my day in bed today but atleast got up to play guitar (I consider that a bit difficult but fun.) And I made myself lunch (difficult for me)"
176206395,"Coincidences can get really bad for me sometimes, especially when I’m in psychosis"
176206396,I think there is like zero chance of that happening. Are you even Korean?
176206397,"I had rice, Bbq chicken, lettuce, and roasted potatoes."
176206398,good luck with getting the job! didn’t the security job work out?
176206399,"Yeah, jail would have to be better than living with these neighbors."
176206400,We changed every calander in the world while you were asleep. Today is actually Monday.
176206401,Depends on what counts. I had delusions until april or so. I had a full breakdown leading to closed ward in 2017.
176206402,Probably not. Mental illness isn’t based on karma or anything. Just accidents.
176206403,Mine didn’t like me and it was mutual. Also water under the bridge at this point.
176206404,Congrats on quitting _AT_MENTION_
176206405,Which ones do and which ones don’t
176206406,"I agree man. An important thing to remember is the looters and vandalizers are almost always not invested in the cause, because the real protesters know it is counterproductive to do that sh it. Those people need to go home. We need peaceful protests in the face of all this violence, to bring people together not drive people apart. Thats what this song is going to be about, unity and strength; hope for the democratic process and rule of law for everyone, not just people the police dont like. And for the record I dont share your pessimism that the protests wont affect real, legislative change. I think people have had enough of the cop mafioso mentality in our country finally."

176206410,Replying to the original topic heading ‘Does truth have authority’ i’d say it depends who is saying it lol
176206411,I’m ok now but I’m so used to feeling that way. Like I don’t trust people to help me when I need help. I think I need to learn to express myself better.

176206424,"Im vaping now - and i believe its the lesser of the two evils, rather than smoking ciggies. Just maybe try to cut it down. I personally would not feel guilty vaping. Im not aware that it affects your meds in anyway, but maybe someone else will prove different."
176206425,It bugs having to leave the house to go to the doctor’s so I can get my prescription. I was thinking of going back to university to study medicine and become a doctor so I could just write my own prescription and not leave the house. Do you have any advice?

176206445,"I can relate. Earlier this year I spoke with an old friend I had not heard from in years. He mentioned he had a son now and how his son was growing up so fast and learning new thing. I told my friend, “You were always pretty bright, you’re son is too.” My friend replied, “Thanks that means a lot to me, you’re the smartest person I know.” I almost scoffed. I was like, “Well, sheee-et.” But I didn’t. Instead I said thanks. These days I certainly don’t feel very bright anymore. It’s been a couple of years since I was on a psychiatric hold, voluntary or involuntary. When I’m on hospitalized, people usually compliment me on my intelligence. My thoughts are that they just compliment everyone there. One time we were playing a game of Trivial Pursuit from the 60’s. The therapeutic coordinator was there and he legitimately complimented my intelligence. His eyes grew wide because I knew the answer to almost every card. Truth is that with Google around, it doesn’t really matter wha

176206489,That’s strange. I don’t know why it would happen. But your health improvement is the main thing.
174395320,I didn’t have delusions when the illness began and I wasn’t on meds. Except I believed the voices were spirits but I don’t think this was a sz induced delusion. I didn’t have any other delusions.
176206490,"I don’t fear it, but, there’s a real chance that if I ever relapse into mania I might lose everything, yes. That’s why I’m real religious about taking my meds and keeping my psych appointments."

176206497,"Sounds good. I have a job peer coaching coming up that’s just 6 hours per week. Plus I might be a facilitator for a support group soon. If I were as high functioning as you, I would work more. It’s probably more fun than working for clubhouse. Maybe you’d make enough to take a vacation somewhere. I’m trying to save up for a decent car. You could also just splurge on yourself like I buy bubble tea a lot."

176206499,"Thanks for the info. I’m sorry that the treatment didn’t work for y’all. I read that it has a 70-90% success rate, so I’m admittedly surprised to hear such bad news. How depressing (no pun intended)."
176206500,"So my brother flew in again here yesterday at about noon. We then had a real estate agent come to look at the house just a little later and she said she’d list it today. And today, we met with my brother’s lawyer to talk about the estate and giving my brother the power of attorney over me both financially and _NAME_ wise. I’m listening to _PERSON_ before I go for my appointment to the lawyer that my brother’s lawyer recommended I contact. To add to that, the people who own my building are doing an assessment of my apartment sometime before 4 p.m. Phew! Through it all, I know I’m lucky to have a brother like _NAME_. He is kind of an alpha male, but he’s not as bad as the guy I used to volunteer for at the computer centre. _NAME_’s had his own struggles for much of his life, but he’s a really solid guy."

176206507,Now I would just ignore him but he owes me a lot of money. In the thousands. I keep hoping he will send me a bit of it anyway. It’s been years since we’ve been together. He is truly a horrid person. He wants to meet me for coffee next week. I told him he’d need to send a minimum of $500 in order for me to agree. What are your thoughts? Go for coffee if he sends money Go for coffee even if he hasn’t sent money Don’t go and forget about money 0 voters
176206508,These two though
174395330,I can have better conversations with people on this. I feel more confident. Mental energy has increased. I’m not as annoyed at life and tasks don’t use as much energy. This is day 1. It could be placebo effect. But yeh I’m more confident and sociable.

174395326,"I just want to inform about my situation with med change.For two years I’ve been struggling with my voices on Clozaril and it lasted during day all the time.I’ve read my old post which lasted for two months when I asked mods to close thread. Last post was on march 27th this year.On april 4th I had bacterial infection which made some blood changes which gave me symptoms of mild neutropenia from Clozaril 250 mg.Next day I went to another hospital (as outpatient),and they told me that I need med change.Fortunately they put me next morning on 4 mg’s of Risperdal and disconuited my Clozaril immediately. After few day days I’ve noticed no voices.It isn’t miracle drug,but in month I didn’t hear voices.Also it brought some changes in my life,I begun to clean the house and focused more on positive things.I just updated this because of people who are taking Clozaril and hear voices like me,that med change can make a big change.Thank you all for support."
176206510,I dont know. I feel like _PERSON_ is just lying about lying. Maybe shes more comfortable telling herself she made it up. It just feels like more denial to me.

176206516,thanx _USER_ID_.i think is corona effecting the stock.iv been to three pharmacies.
176206517,Positives are rarer and ap is doing a good job on as least as I can go. Antidepressant is good. I’ve halved it’s dose in the last 6 months after years on a really high dose. I’m getting old but 20 years on medications and I am totally happy with my meds. Something great comes out tomorrow that helps you lose weight easy I’m not really sure I’d even try it. It’s hard when you find a good regime to give that up at this stage of the game.
176206518,"My sister has _PERSON_ also and she spent many years suffering and crying into her coffee even though she was well medicated. Her MRI was perfect, with plenty of brain tissue and very small ventricles. It wasn’t until a med was released onto the market that suited her did she recover and now she’s happy and well. To anyone who’s struggling, hang in there, the wait might be worth it."
176206519,Beautiful!!! Great job!!!
176206520,"Ah I see. You don’t have to tell her why. And if that isn’t something that works for you maybe try shifting the conversation towards the non religious aspects of the pandemic. Like how more people are using technology to reconnect or even about what the toilet paper manufacturers are doing to keep up with the demand hah. Also changing the subject may work as well.

176206522,"It sounds like you are taking it for something like pervasive anxiety or restlessness? If that is the case, then your new doctor is right. Current research shows clearly that there is absolutely no long-term treatment effect from benzodiazepines for these kinds of symptoms. But it does come with addiction and lots of other dangerous side effects and complications. When we are addicted to something, we also typically believe it is helping us more than it is harming us. I think you should listen to your new doctor and trust that she knows what she’s talking about. A lot of the doctors that prescribe benzodiazepines are ill-informed about how they do and don’t work. Shopping around for doctors to get the prescriptions you want is generally not a good idea…"
176206523,Haha. Cute. 1515
174395327,How did you increase your energy? I have none. Its like a treatment resistant severe depression.

176206531,I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to stay on welfare (called Ontario Works here) my doctor says I won’t qualify for disability. I need money to survive and move. I need to find a job. Wish me luck.
176206532,"I met few days ago a sz person on a bench and we kinda started talking in delusions. He was constantly drinking pure vodka without anything to eat and drink it up. I also invited him to a church mass and he looked weird especially during a part wishing peace to each other and he was breathing really deeply. A couple days ago i met him in a park again, it was around 4pm and he could barely talk, i took him home as he barely stood on his feet, i bought cat food for his cat, some tomato juice and bread rolls with lard inside. He managed to recover, but his renting flat looked really blank : no doors, mattress on a floor, no bed frame, no fridge or oven. Toilet is seen open in a flat. We kept on talking and he said about tactile hallucinations, how his past girlfriends are still living with him, make him drink and have sex with a hallucination. He even called out “_NAME_ come over here” seriously, but there was no one in a flat and when I asked him if he sees another people in a room he said yes. S
o i talked with a mom and she suggested calling to a council, to seek a social worker to helo him out, because he lives alone and he mostly cut any contacts with a family. I called him this evening to talk, and he was reeealy pissed off. I even got scared one moment. But he said hes really afraid of me (mostly because he thinks i might call in an ambulance). He said i have walked over the line and this is none of my business. He sounded a bit agressive also because it is a first day after three day alcohol binge. He stopped meds a year ago, he seems pretty normal while sober, having minor delusions and halucinations. So tell me, should i just watched over it and done nothing?"

176206539,"I’ve been taking Viibryd for the last 4 years. For 3 years I was taking 40mg/day and just this last year have been taking 50mg. It’s in the SMS class of antidepressants which generally have far fewer side effects of SSRIs like Zoloft. Who said it has bad side effects? That’s nonsense. Pristiq is an SNRI like Effexor. Never tried it but supposedly they can cause sexual problems too. The SMS class of antidepressants from what I know are Viibryd (2011-) and Trintellix (2013-). I’m surprised a doctor would push for Viibryd over Zoloft - Viibryd is more expensive to make and is still too new to be sold in generic. What appealed to me about Viibryd was that it was much less likely to cause sexual dysfunction, a problem all of the SSRIs gave me. I can function just fine on Viibryd. It’s just a bit more expensive and doctors normally don’t consider it unless you’ve responded poorly to all of the SSRIs."

176206541,There is a commonality with suicidal people that once they have decided to commit it that they become eerily content and at peace at the thought of it. Entering this stage is a dangerous precipice. Don’t wallow in it and be comfortable in slurry.

176206544,"Being delusional is part of our illness. It happens, no matter how smart someone is. I’m telling you straight, as have others, your posts and cherrypicking is symptomatic of sz’s psychotic behavior and thinking. And when you’re delusional you need a reality check. That’s what the forum is for. No responsible member isgoing to confirm a delusion and encourage it. Rather, we will point out the delusion and continue to do so to help reality check."

176206549,"I never seem to go to the same hospital (probably because of lack of beds, so I get ambulanced over hours away). But, it seems to vary soooo much. The best I had was at a dedicated psych hospital. I think when they don’t have to travel with huge amounts of food through multiple units so the food gets soggy or cold feed people with specific health concerns as their primary audience …the food is better. What bothers me THE MOST is when a hospital repeatedly feeds me food I have an anaphylactic allergy to. The last hospital I was at did that plus they didn’t have an epipen available plus one staff member accelerated another patient’s breathing attack who had both asthma and panic attacks by saying “breathe”, “breathe”, “well, I don’t know how to help you then” and just sat there…didn’t get help or anything. I didn’t trust them to not kill me there (and this was a longer term stay and I wasn’t suicidal at the time). I went on a hunger strike until they could show me an epi
pen. You gotta do what you gotta do."

174395333,Abilify made me compulsively suicidal for the brief time I was on it.
174395338,I read some of this. Why’d you post such a long post? The person when psychotic or delusional doesn’t realize it. Are you asking others to come around to sz?

176206555,Don’t stop your meds on your own. Ask your Dr if its possible to stop it. You might become suicidal again without it. Why were you put on this antidepressant?
176206556,I don’t lie to my doctors I feel that is counterproductive. I will however refuse to speak about certain things more because I don’t want to trigger myself/ I don’t feel comfortable to discuss it.
176206557,I say go for it. The tour sounds like a good idea
176206558,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Thank you. I am debating to see if I should open up to my team about having psychosis. It might aid my diagnosis. _AT_MENTION_ Dementia is one of the many neurodegenerative diseases out there. HSP is just one of them.
176206559,"I think it’s oddly comforting to think the reason the world is like this is because of some secret, evil order controlling everything. But the sad truth is, it’s just people being people, and making mistakes every step of the way."
176206560,"I sometimes talk to myself in thoughts. Recently I started talking a little to myself out loud, like giving myself a exclemation boost if I did something positive and things like that. That seems to be healthy for me. I think it’s probably better to talk to one self in moderation than not talk at all, at least if you don’t see other people often and have a conversation. I realise I have been too quiet. Talking a little to myself helps me feel more alive."
174395345,"If 1 AP controls your symptoms, it is not bad. I am on two APs at max doses. Abilify is a magic pill for me. No side effects. Seroquel has a few side effects. I hope in the long-run I can be just on Abilify. Incidentally, when I had auditory hallucinations initially, all it took was one dose of Abilify to wipe them out. But, the doctor thought it was Bipolar and ADD. Eventually, he gave me Ritalin. I had esoteric experiences for three years after that. It would be the biggest mistake of my life to take Ritalin."
176206561,"I was on medication from September 2016 to January/February 2017 then I stopped. During this time I tried 4 antipsychotics: Orlanzapine, Aripripazole, Risperidone and Quitiapine. (Sorry for my spelling)"

My answer to that dilemma is :drumroll: it depeeeeendsss If you are reckless with others, if you don’t care if you are hurting others with your behavior, then for the love of God, STOP IT.

I graduated from college in 2005. I think if you stop stimulating the brain, over time you just forget how to do things. I’m a stay at home mom. The most intellectual stimulation I get is how to get play dough out of my carpet. I have to go out of my way to stimulate my brain. Pre medicated I was failing in college. After I stabilized, a year later, I was well enough to get a 3.9. I do think you should try to stimulate the brain in some way. And most of the time it’s a struggle just to brush our teeth and get out of bed. I can see that it can be a dangerous cycle. I do think it’s important to focus on what you CAN and work on that, instead of compare yourself to others who are mentally ill or healthy. I bet you have many strengths in your life. Don’t be so hard on yourselves."
176206588,I would ABSOLUTELY love whatever feedback you have because I am in fact a superb writer and that’s not at all narcissistic when you’re stating facts. I got A’s all through college and recieved no less than a B+ on any paper I wrote. I’m in the process of writing a book but my psychiatrist has all of my journals because when I told her that I was going to write a book about it and that I had been journaling by hand she wanted to read them. She’s had them for months but that’s okay because she wants to help me write the book.

My wife doesn’t want me to get back in the hobby. It’s a lot of work and I have gotten lazy with schizophrenia. I kept beautiful tanks though. It also is very expensive.

176206598,yesterday: went kayaking. did more bobbing and floating in the wind than actual paddling. Beautiful day finally. BLT’s for dinner. The house still smells like bacon this morning. Time spent reconnecting with my hubbie. Long overdue and needed. feeling recharged for week #4 of work.
176206599,Fake news disturbs me the most.
176206600,How old are you? I’m just curios to know.
176206601,Yes when I am in a mixed state or if I am psychotic
176206602,"I’ve had a hard time making friends my entire life. I was better at it as a child. But ever since high school, when I was in prodromal stage, I’ve found making friends to be almost an impossibility. From age 17 through age 61, I’ve only made three friends. I recently lost two of these and I’m about to lose the third as of this writing."
176206603,I had fruit loops for lunch and a coke while I took a shower. Next time I think I’ll drink it.

174395348,"You’re correct again Treebeard, replication is the key. Unfortunately replication is not done nearly enough in medical research. There are a variety of reasons for this ranging from ethical ones to funding. In the case of the Chinese Medicine doctor I mentioned, one trial does not justify a conclusion, though you may be right that any affect he had was merely placebo."
174395352,"Welcome to the forum _AT_MENTION_ ! Negative symptoms are a pain in the ****. Some supplements might help. Like sarcosine, l-theanine and NAC. But it’s not a general rule unfortunately.

176206606,Damn they didn’t even pay
176206607,"Sorry that that happened to you. I am more violent without meds as I used knives. Once on meds I punched my brother in the face bcz he didn’t let me listen to music in the kitchen. Even on meds I still get inappropriate sexual thoughts, I was harrassing my underage cousin, good thing I told my brothers about it, they beat me up and I stopped. I think it would have been worse if I didn’t tell my family. I am aware that I am doing something wrong so I tell ppl around me. Voices used to tell me to rape my mother when I started smoking weed. These inappropriate thoughts tell me to look and touch sexually visitors like my cousin’s wife."
176206608,"It would be highly inappropriate for him to answer you. You’re not his patient anymore and he cannot discuss your diagnosis with you. He could get in trouble for that. Why dont you discuss your diagnosis with your current pdoc? You wouldnt gain anything from talking to your past psychiatrist anyways, they cant change your diagnosis anymore."

I have taken Invega in the past, raised my prolactin levels through the roof. I’ve also taken Abilify, but it stopped working. Risperdal I’ve tried briefly, and it seemed to work alright, but I worry about prolactin. I’m very happy with Latuda and I’d love to try something similar. Any ideas?"

176206619,Yes indeed. Since 2015 when all this started. The worst was when I was in hospital and begged the pdoc to let me go see my mum 400km away as she was dying and he did. Got about 100km okay then started having this choking sensation and felt like my car was trying to gas me to death like the nazis did to the Jews. My driving became atrocious and I ended up going into hospital in a city I didnt know very well and they transferred me back home. I totally freaked out. The nurses faces were morphing and she was just being rude to me. So I wrecked that car. But this car is different it says it wants to help me. It compels me

176206621,"Very good med for me, except that I’m one of the exceptionally limited number of folks who reacts to it and got agranulocytosis. That is SUPER RARE and most need not worry, but don’t skip those blood tests! I had good luck with it for the limited time I was on it until I didn’t, and I certainly don’t blame the med for that."

The friend in California wanted me to visit him there and pay my way, but I said no. He then said he and his home health aide would try to come here."
176206626,"I think its common with Schizophrenics. (or correct me if im wrong). My Neighbour upstairs is the worst for it, she shouts her head off. You can tell what shes doing for the day, or whos pissed her off simply by hanging your head out the front door. She actually had a Psych Evaluation for it, and got the all clear - but shes got Learning Delay, so i think its just her way of organising her thoughts."

I buy a bit bottle of syrup and then extract the dxm from the syrup (google), then i drink this lemon/dxm mix that is about 30 ml I feel a lot of things on dxm. The experiences ive had cannot be put into words. But the euphoria is very intense. I will miss it. But i need to let it go."
176206629,It’s a feeling of normalcy. It’s maybe the first time in all these years. It happened gradually. First negatives stopped. Then unusual beliefs. Then voices.
176206630,thank you for the kind wards _AT_MENTION_
176206631,Increase your medicine dosage maybe
176206632,I did took test like this once by psychologist I was creative artist but they said my mind very distincted from reality maybe because my answer is too different from common

176206637,"Stress is quite bad for me. I end up falling back on old coping strategies that aren’t exactly harmful, but keep me from doing important tasks. I’ll play video games, read books or try my hand at various projects instead of taking on some of the important jobs of life. Like, getting my finances under control, making my house less of a pit, learning about stuff for my job, etc. But if I try to take on too many of the things that life demands, I get overwhelmed easily. Over-stress led to my first relapse years and years ago, and I definitely don’t want it to happen again. So has anyone found a way to cope that doesn’t rely on escapism or self-destruction?"

I don’t think I’d be offending if someone told me to “just stop.” But is there anything you use to help yourself stop? Full disclosure: yesterday I used wine so I’d fall asleep. That is not a good long term solution though

I know that my history is against messing with doses, but I really think this time we can try it from a more stable base. Think I might email my care coordinator and ask him to speak to the pdoc about this. I am nearly off the benzos now - just got until Weds next week and I am off it. I have also reduced procycldine without permission. It’s time to cut out some Amisulpride I think, as you say 800mg is too high and I don’t think I need it. My prolactin is also 3 times higher.

Is that possible or the sedation will last until I take the meds? I don’t feel much pleasure on meds, nor I don’t have all my mind nope… I am just numbed, yeap. And its not only the illness. Meds can cause that too. Me too, I need mine but I try to figure what to do…"
176206672,It’s a common problem that I’ve seen. It seems to be a cognitive impairment. I remember on New Year’s Eve driving to a friend’s place I hadn’t been to before.

Last time I move across country I hadn’t been diagnosed sza, my main symptoms hadn’t even really started to come up till after I’d been in my new place a while. But I’m afraid that all the stress piled on made my symptoms worse and I had my first psychotic break. That’s how I lost my job and had to move back home. I’m looking forward to the future but is it unrealistic of me to have such big goals? Should I not set my hopes too high and just settle down where I’m at that way I won’t increase my stress? I suppose I have time to think on it."

Not sure when but 110% confident we will find out by 2036. I remember being told and knowing it. You’ll probably never escape. I think i did. Best we can do is accept, adapt, and cure our schizophrenia. I dont know when schizophrenia will be cured. Perhaps 100 years, but im going to take the norovirus vaccine. Im on year 9 of schizophrenia. Hopefully, ill be semi cured or semi functional/symptom free by year 11 or 12. I was supposed to be cured on year 10, but i guess im not going to be.

The closest thing I’ve seen to that is a pure vegan low fat lifestyle, which I’ve seen two cases of controlling positives (_NAME_ and another person on a forum I can’t source, it was long ago.) Keto can control positives too. Psychology Today Chronic Schizophrenia Put Into Remission Without Medication New research suggests ketogenic diet may play a role in treating schizophrenia. But if you’re just going to adopt the average American diet and expect to fare ok without meds, you’re going to get messed up."

174395362,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Could the severity of symptoms of schizophrenia affect ability of self-appraisal of cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia? Lack of insight as a mediator between the two domains. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience , Nov 2019 13 The relationship between subjective appraisal of cognitive deficits and symptom severity in schizophrenia is unclear. Insight reportedly affects both factors. Our aim is to further asses the relationship between subjective perception of cognitive deficits, symptom severity and lack of insight as a mediator variable. 109 subjects with schizophrenia were evaluated. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was modelled as independent variable, Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia (SSTICS) as dependent and ""Lack of Insight"" (LoI) PANSS Item as mediator one. Mediation was assessed using bootstrap estimation 
approach. LoI acts as a suppressor variable (i.e., it enhances the relation between the independent and dependent variable) between Negative Symptoms and SSTICS, while showing a mediation effect between Depressive symptoms and SSTICS. LoI has a central role in mediating the relationship between negative and depressed symptoms on the one hand and self-appraisals of cognitive deficits (SACD) assessed with SSTICS on the other. Its suppressor role between negative symptoms and STICSS favour a direct effect of negative symptoms on SACD. On the other hand, its mediator role between depression and SSTICS is consistent with several reports of the 'insight paradox' of an enhanced severity of depression in patients with higher awareness of their disability."

176206711,"I hate the idea that I’m in a situation where there’s no hope. The story of Sisyphus, to me, changes that. Here’s my abridged interpretation. If you took any philosophy class, you already know it. Sisyphus was cursed by the gods to forever roll a heavy rock up a mountain. The rock, being heavy, would roll back down. He would have to return to the rock and roll it back up, which would again roll down. Each win is followed by defeat and the gods would relish it. But Sisyphus decided small a change is needed. Every time the rock rolls down, he rolls it back up and adds a gesture of scorn to the gods that punished him. Every loss that occurs will be followed by a win, and the gods that were once delighted to watch him suffer now have to endure his insolence. Forever. He redefined his punishment. This has helped with my intrusive thought spam. These thoughts, that to me are like mean people, come and sit in the foreground of my attention, but I’ve learned to let them be there and live my life in 
spite of them. But this makes them get weaker, then sometimes absent, then they stop coming. New intrusive thoughts can come, but by “rolling the rock” and doing my business those, too, will stop attending. Att I was getting ready for a life of spiting thought spam. But the story became a way to cope. Just wanted to share a story that inspired me. Thanks for reading."

176206733,"# New ‘Atlas’ Maps Links Between Mental Disorders, Physical Illnesses Mental illnesses are associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent physical diseases, new research shows. An international team of researchers has created an ‘atlas’ that maps the relationship between specific mental disorders and the risk of subsequent physical illnesses. The researchers found that following the diagnosis of a mental disorder, psychiatric patients are significantly more likely than the general population to develop potentially life-threatening conditions, including heart disease and stroke. These findings, investigators note, highlight the need for better medical care in this vulnerable population. They have created a website with detailed information about the risks of specific physical ailments and the link to particular mental disorders. “We found that women with anxiety disorders have a 50% increased risk of developing a heart condition or stroke — over 15 years, one in three women 
with anxiety disorders will develop these medical disorders,” lead investigator _NAME_, MD, PhD, University of Queensland’s Brain Institute and Denmark’s Aarhus University, said in a statement. “We also looked at men with substance use disorders such as alcohol-related disorders and found they have a 400% increased risk of gut or liver disorders, while over 15 years, one in five of them will develop gut or liver conditions,” he added. The study was published online April 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine ."

In the case,if you belief that or say that the dopamine is the internal stimuli: you are putting yourself in trouble OR enter a maze while no way out,because you need an Atlas that explain the infinite details of the diversity of these perceptual experiences to the point where it is impossible to limit them, count them or even reduce them to fewer factors For example Can you explain the meaning of the world of all ideas through a state of chemical equilibrium for dopamine or any change that occurs with it,whatever the causes of these changes ? What is mechanism that transforms the quantity / quality of the dopamine secreted in the bra
in INTO identical mental concept ( perceptual experiences) ? In all cases,the actual reality is that the effect of the parasitical functional activities of the conscious hallucination causing all forms of the perceptual experiences and emotional feelings for the human host (regardless the level of chemical balance degree) !!! it causing an audible vocal thoughts which you call them Perceptual experiences !"

176206823,"Yup, that’s why I cant ever work again. My mind is shot and the more I put it to work the more it hurts. That’s why I rest more than half the day."
176206824,"Fish oil works really well to help. You can get it from your pharmacist ask your pdoc to prescribe it maybe your insurance will cover it, if not it’s pretty cheap through the pharmacy. I only pay like 3 bucks a month and it really has helped my concentration and working memory. I used to have a hard time balancing my checkbook even, now I can easily do it. I used to not be able to watch a show on tv now I can somewhat. I can now do math in head. Little things really, but they are nice."
176206825,The longest I made it was about 6 months I think? It ended up with me in the hospital. Won’t be trying that again
176206826,Congratulations!!! Way to go!!!

176206828,"_PERSON_, I suffered since too long… probably more than 20 years… I’ve isolated for quite long too, but I kept some friends… I have ill friends, they got better on their meds, or whatever it was… Me, not… we tried all the possible aps for ten years and even my ex pdoc said, that she cant help more… Now I fight but maybe I have these damages from the isolation, my sickened body from the sedentary, the damages of the loneliness and maybe still just the illness… I tend to think, that no one will love me for long like this my best friend who is ill too, said to me that she would have killed herself in my place… I struggle now even for life. But it’s hard to hear things like this… I hope that I’ll become more positive one day… but I am not sure I like what the others see in me now… maybe this is my mistake still, still a sz… but it’s hard when you were alone for so long, with your hellish thoughts with no one by your side…its been too long too maybe, idk…"

176206830,Sounds some decent plans. Well done to you and hope you get to where you want. It really does take some hard work getting over those little things. Nicotine and alcohol are hard to give up and are pretty habit forming. Try replacing bad with good and try some exercise. It can make a big difference for your mental health too.

174395415,"My state legislatures in their infinite wisdom of austerity over all other logic has approved a very abbreviated drug list for their SSI/SSDI covered meds. We are left with 2 2nd generation AP’s (risperdone, and clozapine) and a few typical antipsychotics. I am hoping to swing risperdone as my antipsychotic but everything else is definitely up in the air. I imagine that the Psych Wards in my state will eventually be full of schizophrenia patients and a lot of pandemonium will occur. On the other hand if a typical antipsychotic were to work as well that didn’t have the weight gain side effects we may be better off as workers which I’m sure is Part B of the equation. Other than that bit of optimism I think we are screwed and I hope things are changed for the better."
176206832,"I don’t know about you, but taking an anti anxiety medication even though I know it doesn’t really work on anxiety attacks, helped when I was having them. I knew that I’d done something proactive to stop it and that in the time it takes for the medication to get in my system, that I would be able to survive and then maybe get some relief. It felt like I was putting a very effective time limit on how long I would have to suffer with the panic attack."

Plus I have relex sympathetic dystrophy since 11, my entire right leg up to back. I walk with a cane, I’ll be 35 in Feb. It’s ????, the arthritis they say is only gonna get worse, no meds have stopped the spread, and tramadol and tizanadine for the RSD isn’t ???? after being on percocet for 8 years. They just yanked that away in 2008. So yeah, hurts. Plus my pelvis was broken with my second child’s birth, so it sits crooked.

176206838,"I have lower back pain. I have bulging discs in my lower back and it causes pain in my back, hip and legs. It’s cased by weight and age and not taking care of my back and getting good exercise when I was younger I think. I manage it with tylenol and advil and don’t sleep too long at any one time. If you’re having problems with your back it might be a good idea to have your doctor check it out you could have an issue going on that physical therapy could help."
174395422,"Unfortunately, in my experience it had strong side effects, as well. You can’t speak means, do you drool too much? In that case, there are remedies like Altropine drops. From my understanding, Clozapine is considered a Gold Standard drug for this condition in the UK. It is tried very early during treatment. In the US, though, they try to avoid it as much as they can. After being through all of it, I think they have it correct in the US. This medication is rough on side effects."

They get paid through insurance policies and seem to do pretty well.
176206845,i have that since i was a teenager along with fast thoughts. Meds made it worse tho. Its kind of like everything feels like a dream and stuff.

176206847,"Keto diet is good, but would not recommend for mentally ill as I tried it. You could try liberal Keto Diet which is like Keto, but moderate carbs, basically meat and veggies, no bread, potatoes, crisps,sweets. You could also increase your metabolism by splitting your 3 meals into 6 and eating every 2-3 hours, this way your body won’t feel hungry and wont be likely to store food into fat. Try also include up to 100grams of healthy nuts into a diet, non-saturated fats increases your metabolism."
176206848,Well at least you weren’t around people in the outside. I wasn’t around people both outside or online for sort of 10years. Or at least that’s what my voices say. Do you count 2 or 3 close friends as being around or not.
174395423,"i seemed to of gone into remission after about 8 years for psychosis related things. but negative symptoms persisted. So i got a referral for rtms at a university near me. got like 48 treatments. That seemed to of levelled me out pretty good, brought emotions back. I would still be doing maintenance treatments pnce a month if it wernt for covid19 shutting the research facility down until the gov lets them continue. havnt been treated in over 4 months and im still doing pretty good. I have little dips in mood here and there. The rtms didnt help me with my persistent fatigue and tiredness. (sleeping 12+hrs and still tired all day) So my pdoc said she was 99% sure I have a circadian rhythm disorder as well. So im on a wait list for a sleep study. In the meantime I started researching on treatment for non24hr sleep disorder and delayed sleep phase disorder. I started taking melatonin in micro amounts at night (0.25mg to 0.5mg) the amount your body typically produces to tell your brain its time to go to 
sleep. It doesnt make me sedated or anything. and I also started doing light therapy every morning with bright light glasses to stop the melatonin production. That pretty much halved my fatigue and tiredness. So that was a major breakthrough for me as well. So after all that I’m doing pretty good. On another note. I think I am very much a grey area case. As my illness experience and treatment was atypical. I wasn’t put on aps when I had psychosis episodes and I had several bad ones, instead I just lived through them. Probably damaged my brain in the process. but hey thats just how my life went and now Im working hard to get things going forward. Later on I tried seroquel but it gave me sleep agression which was bad and was taken off it immediately. Now that I have a good pdoc. I have risperidone as a prn just in case. so long story short. it seems for me ‘‘time’’ was what allowed me to go into remission. not any supplement or med. just time."

176206853,Well the only embarrassing thing i did is get my shot
176206854,For me it’s the voices that cause my delusions. I do do reality check first but the voices can always convince me
176206855,"Invega Susstenna Injection has SAVED MY LIFE. I’ve been on it for close to two years now. About 8 months ago we did have to up the dose from the standard 117 to 156, but things have never been better for me on any other medication. Really goes to show medicines work entirely differently in everyone. I hated life before Invega, with it, my life is livable again. I still have hallucinations (auditory and visual) but no medication or combo of meds has ever taken them away entirely. I am fully functional again thanks to Invega. I strongly suggest no one writes off a single medication because of another’s experience. Just because it didn’t work for them, doesn’t mean it can’t seriously change your life for the better and vice versa."
176206856,I don’t really understand how to be in reality. This must be real right? People keep telling me “were all just waiting for you to wake up” and there’s been mention of a coma when people talk about their other patients. This world I live in is a scary place. And I’ve done more than my share of substances that could very well put me into a coma. In fact I didnt realize for a long time one of my go to drug’s effects (my favourite effect) is actually you slipping into a coma. It’s a state that I told myself I wish it could last forever. The feeling made me feel complete. I hear family cheering me on to “wake up (my name)” sometimes when I go to bed and close my eyes. What is my psyche trying to tell me? How does one wake up? I don’t want to exist in my world thats always degrading. I don’t understand.

I noticed on here most threads are lounge ones and get the most responses. I know we have serious times with our sz/sza and want to relax, but when it comes to discussing the important serious things it looks like less people write posts.

176206862,in my experience all mental health problems are caused by beliefs depression is caused by a belief in not being good enough scizophrenia is caused by a belief in imaginary friends once you get free of beliefs there is nothing to be scared of as far as existential fears its the irrational fears caused by beliefs that make you scared but they are all lies and beliefs are all irrational
176206863,It is strengthening to me as I had always suppressed fear before.

Or how the government put a camera in my analog clock in my living room. Or about how everyone knew what I was thinking because my thought were being broadcast. I was put on risperidone and olanzapine. I took these things and it cleared my head. Whenever I become more paranoid, these same delusions come back. I am on invega sustenna and olanzapine now, and I feel okay. Now with therapy I’ve learned to recognize when I’m headed down that road again so my psychiatrist can adjust my medicine."

His dad was supportive, or on the fence of his decision, because he was so convincing that he didn’t need them, and didn’t want to take them, and on the outside, he appeared that way. Then to avoid this, he lived the streets away from the cops coming to get him. just a real sad story. sorry for rambling. feel for ya."

174395448,"The simplest things in social situations, and I struggle. But my friends understand. (Banging my head against the wall) I maybe can text it, but I can’t in person. “Normals send other signals in conversational encounters. They use short statements at the beginning and end, “How are you?” or “See you Wednesday,” and longer statements in the middle. They also lower the pitch of their voice to indicate they are finished. Schizophrenics tend not to do this. We seem to have a defect in our cue signaling mechanisms. As a result we often have difficulty in knowing when we should be ending a conversation or how to do it.” Also this is a big stumbling block. The normmies think this behavior is unacceptable “Those of us with schizophrenia are very sensitive to having our feelings hurt. Insults, hostile criticism, and other forms of psychological assault would us deeply, and we bear scars from these attacks to a much greater degree than do our normal friends. Because we have this hypersensitiv
ity, naturally enough we try to protect ourselves and prepare ourselves from possible future attacks. By way of this, one of the things we do is replay in our minds situations where we have been hurt, trying to develop strategies of response so that if we find ourselves in similar situations again we will not be so damaged again. What we are doing in our minds is saying to ourselves “What I should have said was…” or “I should have told that guy that I am just as good as he is.” We rehearse or reply situations over and over in our minds, and we often find ourselves speaking in an audible fashion when we are doing this. We have a definite compulsion to engage in this sort of behavior.” Sorry posting a lot. Like I talk to myself, I text out loud too."

174395436,"I am a 28 year-old Spanish male. I’m on the tops of despair: I find no future for me, I don’t even know what happens to me and what can I do to solve or mitigate it. The only exit I see for my suffering is to take my own life, I think of it every day 24/7. But I am not going to do so; I have parents who love me and although I have almost no hope, it is not completely exhausted yet, although it is about to. I come here to ask for support and basically help for knowing what is wrong with me and If someone has been in my situation. When I was 17 I smoke pot, weed in a bong. It was my damnation. I experienced horrible sensations, terror, fear of have gone mad, confusion. I could not barely talk, neither think at all. I feel like my thoughts went crazy, totally out of my control, I couldn’t even know the content of that thoughts, they were extremely fast, absurd, and repetitive. I also saw psychedelic like images, very colorful, as if it were a kaleidoscope. I have never use cannabis since then. T
he day after that, I noticed that my inner world had changed, also my perceptions of the outer world. I categorice that symptoms now basically cognitive: I could not read as before, if seemed so difficult to understand a text. I could not listen to two or more conversations, I tried to focus on one but at the end I didn’t get any of them. Any cognitive task: read, think, write, recall, play videogames, it was way harder than before. I also had difficulties to speak, I made mistakes in the pronunciation of the words and I often forgot names and words. I was convinced that I have some kind of schizophrenia-like disorder. My parents didn’t believe me in the first place, and I got used to It somehow, although my life had changed so dramatically so I didn’t search for further help. But in my inner self I got obsessed with the idea that I was doomed. I graduate from school and started physics at college, but it did not went well for me, I could not understand the problems, my memory, attention etc were impair
ed. I also had a lack of energy and joy. Then It happened again suddenly. I was at a bar and I experienced the same dissociation/confusional state/panic attack that I experienced smoking cannabis but at that moment without a cannabis use. I said to my friends there I didn’t feel right and I went home. I could barely speak. The outer world perceptions and the inner experience seemed so weird. I had tremor and tachycardia. That’s when I first saw a psychiatrist. She told me that It definitely wasn’t schizophrenia. I got AD (Escitalopram), and Benzodiazepines for my anxiety (Alprazolam). I was not happy with my diagnosis, because I my problem of depression and anxiety were secondary as my cognitive symptoms were primary. I got rapidly worse, I was crying all day, I had a dramatically lack of energy and motivation, and my anxiety and panic attacks or whatever It were become part of my life. I continued with my antidepressants, (venlafaxine + mirtazapine), and benzodiazepines (lorazepam) for years. My mood g
ot better somehow and I had a brief state of wellbeing. But it was far away to be normal. My cognitive deficits were there. I started another degree in an online college, (Psychology). I also started a new relationship with a girl. But a year after the remission of my depressive symptoms I got exposed to a stressful situation that lasted for months and I got mind sick again. I experienced thought blocks, repetitive, clanging thoughts. I also woke up at night suddenly, sweating and with rapid heartbeat, in a state of confusion and also seeing the psychedelic-like colorful images. I experienced other new symptoms, like constant mistakes in my writing: the letters of the next words of the sentence I was writing were unconsciously getting into the words I was writing. The same thing happened to me when I spoke. My capacity to do tasks was very impaired. I saw faces in stains and I almost could hear my absurd, repetitive and improductive thoughts. I got depressed again, and I came back to my previous meds. I was s
ure I was in a prodromal schizophrenia but my doctor didn’t see any psychotic symptoms so my diagnostic was depression + anxiety. I came to other many doctors since then, and I have tried, sertraline, clormipramine, desvenlafaxine, mirtazapine, bupropion, vortioxetine and even a 10mg dose of olanzapine as adjuntive. I only got weight. My cognitive symptoms, and depression symptoms only got worse. Some doctor said I could have esquizotipic personality disorder, but personality test that I made don’t corroborate that diagnosis. Now I am basically alone, as my girlfriend left me, I came to my parent’s, I don’t have job or other life goals, my cognitive deficits are growing slowly but constantly, and I have clear symptoms of avolition, blunted affect, passivity, extreme difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity, block of thought, attentional impairment and I am deeply anhedonic. I have energy for doing basically nothing and I experience no pleasure at all. I can’t manage to do more than simpl
e tasks and I difficulties keeping my goals in mind. AD caused me sexual disfunction, anorgasmia and erectile disfuction, and my is my libido is on the floor. As my meds didn’t seem to work I quit AD’s and I am quiting benzodiazepines too. I started to take tryptophan, l-tyrosine, omega 3 fatty acids, and recently I started to take bupropion on monoterapy. I feel tired as usual, unmotivated, and desperately anhedonic, but sometimes I also paradoxically feel too much activated and I feel intrapsychic pain and disforia. I ask for help: tips or any other information that could help. I also wanted to ask if you have experienced that symptoms, and the same evolution of the disorder. I have cognitive + negative symptoms of schizophrenia but for now I am not psychotic. By last, what meds or medical food could you recommend for my case? Thanks a lot."

We have been locked down for a third time since the day after Christmas day, and now they’re going to slowly open things until June - which may be longer if new variants come here.

176206942,"My Pdoc said it’s normal, which I already knew. But he went on and asked a follow up which was something like: “Does is make you feel bad?” To which I said “No.” And he simply said “Good.” This forum though has made me wonder since porn is unethical; yet strumming it to those you’ve talked to in real life is also “problematic?” It kind of leaves you with nowhere to go. So I’m now in the same boat as the poster who said they “get it over with as soon as possible.” As a positive sidebar: I’ve discovered cold showers; It’s harder, and makes me feel proud of myself while I lather up my naked body. If anything it’s like training wheels for hot showers… hot showers are now easier to take. The payoff also extends after the cold shower too.

176206944,"I don’t worry about society. I worry about individuals. Society as a whole is a mixed bag. There’s plenty of disfranchised groups if you look at the big picture. Personally, I don’t do drugs, I’m not violent, I’m a working, tax paying citizen. So I have a clear conscious and believe I am free to do what I want within reason. When I’m driving around or taking a walk in the park I’m more worried about the occasional as*hole who might want to bother me but on the whole, people ain’t worried about me. People in cars or other hikers glance at me for a second and then go back to playing with their kids or talking to their girlfriend/boyfriend. I realize there’s _USER_ID_ out there, my neighbors are a certain ethnicity who dress in clothes that are traditional in their culture and play music particular to their culture. I think they look down on us but I have more problems with the other mentally ill people in my own building. When it’s gets too bad I leave and get away. No one can sto
p me from going to the park or out to eat or wandering around the store seeing if there’s anything I want to buy. I help myself by being clean and nicely groomed and dressing nice. When I was shopping at the drugstore last night there were a couple people who bugged me but worrying about society didn’t even cross my mind. Afterwards, I went to use my coupon for a free chili dog but ended up driving through McDonalds. Some asinine teenage girl in the car ahead of me was playing some game and kind of fooling around trying to bug me but it had nothing to do with society, she was just a typical teenager being an ass. I don’t think the word “society” crossed my mind the whole night. Society can take care of themselves, I’m more worried about me and my life and my own personal problems and challenges."
176206945,How can I feel better when I’m dead
176206946,"Dear Noise, im so sorry. I can imagine. That latter one was so not okay. Maybe still give the first one a chance though? It is normal I think, after your experiences especially, to not trust them right away? I think it is actually healthy and natural to first want to get to know someone well before you trust them with your deepest hurts and fears. Did you tell the first one how difficult you find it? Could you, to see how he responds? I too was hurt in psychiatry…and find it hard to trust them. With my current therapist i have told them how hard i find it to trust her. Every time she does something “hurtful” accidently i freak out inside, think “you are the same as all of them!”, emotionally run away and tell her im quitting. Then calm down a few days and talk about what happened. We can kind of joke about it and peacefully discuss her “mistake”, what old betrayal it touched on in me, my response and what both of us could do differently next time. By her responses to this i slowly sta
rt to trust her more. So i can kind of see how trusting a therapist is hard. Maybe you can trust the first one just enough to tell them you find it so hard to trust him because of past experiences with therapist? And see if he deals with that well? How are you feeling now? Are you a little okay again?"

176206995,"I told my psychiatrist I came completely off weed for the first time in over 10 years… I haven’t smoked it in about thirty days now. He told me to consider trying CBD oil, which surprised me because I was hoping I could just stay away from all things marijuana related. He seems to think it might replace what THC-focused marijuana did for my insomnia, without causing the same psychotic symptoms. I live in California at the moment so it’s an option. If nothing else, I’m pretty sure the oil is expensive, and I’m enjoying the money I’m saving from not smoking pot, so I think I’ll probably avoid it. It’s something to keep open as an option in the future I suppose. I lived the majority of my life in a state where marijuana was illegal so this is all kind of new to me."

Today, I have to work morning and night again. I am bored at times. Life is ok- ho hum at its best. I will try to do some more coursework tomorrow. I have a new course I have not started yet. I cut back on my work hours to focus on coursework. I’d like to go to grad school soon. I need to pace myself to see if it is feasible. I will work part-time while doing an online program. It will be mostly writing. We shall see!"

176207027,_AT_MENTION_ what is a good medication for insomnia…
176207028,Just stick with it. When i stopped and restarted my meds they usually stop working or lose effectiveness and i take higher doses…

176207038,"So… I had my first psychosis at age 26. Then again at 29, 30 (when I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia) and 33. I always thought that the strange coincidences that happened, the fact that I was reading into what people were saying and some of my strange beliefs that formed were related to workplace political situations. However every doctor, nurse, etc whom I spoke to kept telling me I was delusional and I was hearing things, etc. Something interesting happened to me last week. I noticed the same string/pattern of events begin to occur that have happened to me every time previously (where each has ALWAYS resulted in a full on psychosis and hospitalisation). However, this time round - I immediately began a paper trail on Slack Messenger with HR, got screenshots of all of my Slack conversations, began recording all of my Google Meet sessions (most people are working remotely due to COVID) and began analysing (but I think without overanalysing) each interaction. And this ???? is real Because I was ab
le to validate (and also in part because I just came by a tonne of cash - through share bonuses from my last employer, and thus I feel far more secure and less at risk of homelessness), it never ended up turning into a full on psychosis. And I actually feel pretty good right now (~1 week later), I’m not pacing back and forth, I’m not chain smoking cigarettes and I feel quite chill. Don’t know if I’m “cured”, but at least I now have an element of control around this stuff. I do have to find another job now though. I can’t work with these people…"

176207042,"I cannot remember my old self too. I guess I used to be a narcissist or something, but I did a true 180. A lot of dissociation like DP/DR and sensory issues messed me up more than schizophrenia. I also lost a lot of abilities to think and to do work. I prided myself on my brain and I lost that. I had nothing else going for me."
176207043,Thanks for your reply. I constantly try to make sense of this but I always reach the conclusion that I trust my brain wouldn’t do this to me.

Personally I subdivide the nature of delusions madmen experience in two categories. That is, 1) delusions of grandeur; and 2) paranoia. I put myself into the first category that is “the chosen one” delusion. Are there any individuals who experience “negative content” in their “voices” and also have delusions of grandeur like myself?"

176207161,"oh true, maybe some changes that youve made to your life recently? Cymbalta inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. It also increases dopamine by acting on dopamine reuptake pumps, thus increasing the diffusion of dopamine in the brain maybe there’s an excess/deficit in dopamine or serotonin"

The tiredness is still there. I’ve reduced to taking 1 pill per day. I’m also noticing a bit of depression but it might be Klonopin withdrawal. As of last night, my breakthrough symptoms at night seem to be almost all gone. Also, I notice I can drink a ton of tea and it has no effect on me anymore."

176207174,Its worth a shot. Im definitely not 100% my old self but its a noticeable improvement. You should ask your doctor if you can try it. You should go on 300mg this time. Thats what im on.

But I also think its the medication that got rid of the experience. I don’t miss it at all. I barely remember what it was like, but I know it was constant and very annoying.

176207210,That sounds rough. So your partner is angry with you about it? Or just frustrated you’re making it worse by following that kind of stuff? Are you still not taking your meds?
176207211,"My favourite AP is amisulpride the one I’m on now. It really helped me get stable and I’ve tried other meds but always returned to taking it. I’ve been on it for almost seven years now. Next best AP was risperidone. It worked just as well. I took it from 2005-2007 then stopped meds for five years and was in remission but relapsed in 2012. Olanzapine comes next. When I first took it i was a bit like a zombie but I discovered a few years ago with my pdoc at the time that a low dose along with my amisulpride helped a lot with depression I took sulpiride for a week in hospital but don’t know how much it would have worked because they switched me to amisulpride Other AP’S I was on were haloperidol, quetiapine (Seroquel) and clozapine but they didn’t work for me. The clozapine gave me severe side effects so I stopped it. The other two didn’t work at all."

176207213,"I have been looking into a mental health recovery hospital, called Homewood. I’ve left them two messages already, and have had no response. I am wondering if maybe I said too much in my first message, I mentioned that I have a head injury and schizophrenia. Perhaps that scared them off? I would have at least expected the professional courtesy of returning my call My neuropsych has cancer, my old therapist is retiring in a month, and I feel like I’m left hung out to dry. Like a discarded Factory defect. This hits me as particularly hard right now, because I really do feel like I’m on the verge of a breakthrough. I want to get my life back together, and stop feeling half alive I can’t stand the idea of getting to know a new therapist all over again, and familiarizing them with my trauma history.

176207227,"I take it since 7 years, once in 2 days… I take 1 mg, when i take it… But i wonder if i’ill do it without it one day? In fact, i felt more emotions today and i realized, that the lack of them in the past, was making me quite crazy… I guess the oppressed emotions so deep in me is a negative symptom isnt it? I fight this now since an year with a bit more activities, some efforts, some exteriorisation by talking more, i also let in the suffering, cause avoiding it seems to me pathological… And today, for the first time, i felt my emotions saner, stronger, more obvious too… But i still risk to need more time in order to heal better. So i’d still need my klonopin. Is it so dangerous to be so long on it? Who else takes benzos here since years? It helps my sadness even tbh, my body too, who is in torture sometimes by the way that i am functioning still in sickness… My ex pdoc was allowing me the klonopin, but not my current doc. He is scared of the addiction… But i really need it. I have

These are powerful medications and not to be messed with. You’re probably not experiencing symptoms due to the medication!! If you go off them your symptoms may come roaring back at full force."
174395511,"I’ve complained about my neighbors enough but earlier this evening the counselor for these apartments came by and talked to the women next door and then she came to my door and both of them came in and we talked. It was done like adults, civilized, respectful. But we talked about one minor point for about 20 minutes and that was it. WTF is wrong with me? The ladies have pulled some really rotten, low, underhanded sh*t that you just don’t do. But the woman appeared to still like me, she looked me right in the eye with a very friendly look. But now I’m even doubting she meant it. I’m no saint, but I have to look out for myself. And all that got settled is that she can sit in back under the carport. She had moved because she thought it bothered me (which it has, but I was willing to concede that point, in order to win others) I think because she was so nice, I tried to take it easy on her. The guy upstairs died very recently so with all due respect, I thought things would get easier. And a new 
guy moved in upstairs and does a kind of weird, creepy little walk above. I’m going upstairs in a little while to just meet him and talk to him and see what I’m in for, maybe nip any problems in the bud. But I thought the meeting went well, but 5 minutes later when they left I thought about it and I realized the only good thing about it was I proved to the counselor that I am willing to talk things out and I can talk rationally. Which actually is a “given” for me. But the meeting was ludicrous. The ladies have been playing off my being nice for months. The little laughs, the craziness, turning every ounce of intensity of their problems and focusing it on me. My mind survived two solid years of mentally crippling psychosis. It survived four years of crack addiction and the lifestyle of a practicing addict. Hell, I have literally been to over a thousand 12-step meetings. But now my mind is a little weaker, a little more tired after 38 years of paranoid schizophrenia. Can’t deal with hate as easily. An
yways, I will have to wait a week to talk to the counselor, she’s going out of town. I’ve handled bad roommates and neighbors before, but you can’t fight someone who ingratiates themselves into your world and then takes advantage of it to use against you. It’s not like I’m physically afraid, it’s the psychological aspect of just wearing me down. I can surely handle it but it just exhausts me. I need a little help until I get back on track and can defend myself better. This is pretty much what’s going on. So much for my golden years."

Most of the questions relate to attitudes or experiences regarding different types of tobacco. They ask no mental health questions EXCEPT “has a dr diagnosed you with psychosis or schizophrenia?”. (Our staff person was shocked when the answer was yes the first time. She’s supposed to remain neutral and always had, but she broke a little and even read the question a second time in case we hadn’t heard correctly.)

176207280,"You could possibly be correct that someone followed you. It might have happened twice. Maybe. But you’re making it sound like you get followed all the time and that is extremely unlikely. A bunch of random, different, unrelated strangers would not be following you. I’ve been through similar faulty perceptions. It might help to look at your own driving patterns. That may be the problem. If you are driving too slow for instance people might come up fast behind you to make you go faster or they might follow you for a short while out of frustration. Another possibility is if you are looking at other drivers. I tend to look at other people out of curiosity and a lot of them dig it, lol. But if you are staring or frowning or have an attitude towards other drivers it may piss people off or offend them and they may follow you for a minute out of revenge. Sadly, one scenario I hate when it happens to me when I drive is that sometimes I am simply unaware of my surroundings and teenagers or even adult jer
ks might get their kicks from playing games and tailgate you and be on your tail for awhile. And there are other scenarios that could be happening. But these are exceptions.

You think a bunch of people are following you and singling you out for harassment but they just see you as another driver just like anyone else. It’s almost impossible that every new day a bunch of new drivers organize themselves to single you out and follow you. Where I live it’s very fast-paced and people sometimes act like other drivers are just in their way. So they zoom past or come up fast behind me. I think your perceptions are wrong. But there has to be a reason why you think this is happening to you. It may be something crazy and unexplainable. (I’m not calling you crazy obviously). But the problem is that it seems real to y

Prior I was only on mood stabilizers. I got out and went home with my family and was no longer suicidal bc I was no longer in torture. I can’t truly describe how I felt prior except living in immense fear. Totally anxiety. Felt everyone and everything was connected to the people who follow me. Thought they went through extensive effort of hiring many people and everything was bugged and everyone was taking pictures. I could think straight and has huge nervous energy but could barely get off my bed most of the time. Thought the hospital was putting bleach in my water so hubby brought me bottled water. When I put it down for a second they bleached it again I thought. Everything felt like noise. I felt confused and needed lists broken to try to take a shower or anything and still could not often. To me my AP made all difference and had a cal

I just never got myself back and still have fairly bad anxiety and feel paranoid a little and have some magical thinking which is whatever, who cares about that - mag thinking part of schizotypal. I guess I just need to be grateful if not being where I was instead of feeling crappy about where I am now. Still not myself but better than I was then.

I know that in hospital I was on a high dose and it was like mind fog, I want to coach people away from high doses and away from cold turkey quiting. If you’re going to quit, have a plan, have a back up and leave yourself avenues to get help. I don’t think I’m unwelcome here because I feel relatively cognizant of how my mental faculties have been effected. I do know that my ability to imagine has dulled and I only really get it back when I’m sleeping and semi lucid dreaming.

Dont see evil intent where there is none. Also, indeed, how i experience my delusions and how others i spoke to or read research about experience their delusions or voices is personal and subjective. People i spoke to with sz in my experience werent in general more malignant than others. Sometimes even less so, f.e. when their thoughts were actually driven by empathy (e.g. worry about others going to hell). Also research shows that part of the people actually have kind voices. I do not claim to have knowledge of some universal truth though. Im human. The same goes for you and your impression of what sz is though. You do not have objective knowledge of sz any more than others. I think you can not objectively say all other people with sz have malignant feelings.

I try and think of it as sitting in a freezing cold shower. It sucks, it’s really not fun, but I can take it for some time, and I usually feel good afterwards. That’s my experience."

174395550,"I get a couple of free bags of groceries once a month from the food bank. They give staples and a really good variety of food, best food bank I’ve ever been to. It’s a good way to save money. I’m doing OK with money these last few months and since there’s a lot of people not working because of the pandemic and more families struggling than usual my sister suggested I skip getting the groceries because other people might need them more than me. Yesterday was the day to pick the food up and I was realy torn on whether to get the groceries or not. I went back and forth, I was reasoning that yeah, I have a little extra money now, but money tends to go really fast and as a schizophrenic, it doesn’t happen very often that I’m ahead of the game and may not happen again for a very long time. I was going to go there after work yesterday but I made the decision to skip it this month. And it made me feel a little good, I made the right decision."
174395552,Yeah call the pharmacist and ask. They can tell you about the safety of it.
176207400,I struggle with this too there are things that happened when I was psychotic and I still wonder if they actually happened
176207401,"I was a fool. I was shy and socially awkward, adventurous, intelligent, sensitive, childlike, naive, carefree, perfectionist, flirtatious, temperamental, totally impulsive and rather clueless as to what i was doing and what was important in life. A loose cannon. Quiet outside and fiery inside. I was interested in travelling, social sciences, different cultures, religions and languages (portuguese, chinese, arabic), rock climbing, being in nature, playing board games, going out and doing stupid student stuff. I disliked boredom most of all. I disliked my studies (public management) cause it was boring and a total mismatch. I disliked social group situations. I disliked duties like household chores and homework. I disliked fixed obligations that limited my freedom. Again: a fool."
174395554,How can it help? Trust me its not fun having SZ and corona together because you can certainly die. SZ doesn’t necessarily kill you.
176207402,It depends on if you did something criminal or illegal? Police picking you up and taking you to the hospital never went on my record on a background check because I never did anything illegal.
176207403,I hate this feeling? Do you also think the same as this? Any tips to get over it ?
176207404,Risperdone is ok but it gave tics like in the eye. My eyes would contantly shiver when I was on it.
176207405,"I also have a porn addiction. I always tell myself before I masturbate “This is the last time!”, then I cave in a few days later. I’ve got it down to only 2-3 times a week, but I’d like to eliminate it from my life completely. It’s terrible."
176207406,I feel sick after eating
176207407,I just wish people would take me seriously when I’m not symptomatic about how serious my illness is.
176207408,Maybe you have a virus?
176207409,I do remember because it was only in 2018 that I attempted coming off meds
176207410,I agree _PHONE_NO_
176207411,_AT_MENTION_ Good for you! Congratulations!
176207412,I think a lot of stay at home fathers feel tremendous guilt for robbing the cradle. Mothers should be able to focus on the children and not have to coddle grown husbands. I envied the divorced.
176207413,"I’m glad you posted this cause I’m kind of tempted to drink a twisted tea in the fridge, but I’ll give it to someone else. I don’t want to mess up my med levels since I started a new med recently. I’m feeling irritable though and on edge."

176207418,That’s crazy talk. Did you quit taking your meds?
176207419,I have heard its a good drug. I wanted to try it but my doctor wants me on xeplion
176207420,I have dreams I’m psychotic and roaming the streets. And getting sent to hospitals that don’t even exist. Escaping and running down the street at night to my parents house.
176207421,I’m around 240 lbs and smoke (switching to vape doesnt seem to be working) so I know where you are coming from.
176207422,"Smoothies are a good way to get fruit and veg in, and veg soup I love too. Also hiding veg or fruit in your cooking. Like when I make lentil bolognaise like I did today, I add onion and tomato and sometimes grated carrot as well. And when I make flapjacks I add grated apple or a banana. I admit I’m not fond of salads so the only way I get raw veg in is in my smoothie - I put _NAME_ and carrot in with the banana and apple and sometimes blueberries as well."
176207423,"So. It is Morally Unconventional to Feel The Need to Control Free, Creative Individuals Jus Outside of Your Reach. With The Desire to Hoard a Slice of The Eternal Pie. That Has Nothing to Do With You or Your Moral Values. For it is Believed That, That, is Bad Behavior Without Any Thoughts For Clean, Future Progress. For When You Can’t Leave The Vaulted Door Open as You Pass Through, For Those Who Follow Behind, Well That Could Be Considered as a Metaphorical Crime. Where Karma Awaits, Making a List And Checking it Thrice!. So. The Question Arrives, How Does One Escape That Kind of Reprehensible Behavior?. Safely?."
176207424,Are you taking Metformin?

174395555,"Abilify caused me addiction and hypersexuality issues I lost over 100 000$ because of it. I switched to Risperdone now 3mg and no more issues. I nearly killed my self 3 times when unmedicated. I wanted to prove to myself that I am God so I swallowed a whole Tylenol bottle, emergency drs said I was close to die from liver failure. Another time I traveled alone to Germany thinking I am the next _PERSON_, I bought knives there and was close to stab myself. My issue is that both, my positive and negative symptoms are severe so I need high dose. I also have moderate Catatonia when unmedicated, mild with meds, I freeze for many minutes. Did you experience catatonia? Were your negative symptoms severe like you stayed in bed all day 24/7 everyday only got up to eat?"
176207429,This is exactly what happened to me. Had I not listened to him I wouldn’t be in the situation I’m in now
176207430,"I wanted to talk about this before I forget- there’s a term commonly referred to as “brain fog”, which is a state of cognitive decline. It’s very common in people with chronic fatigue and chronic illnesses, like fibromyalgia. As a person who has a chronic illness and who suffers from brain fog, I wanted to talk about my experience in my own terms with cognitive decline. It’s like, my brain is in a permanent sense of “fog”, and I’m unable to think clearly or speak clearly. It’s like having your eyes blindfolded or your eyes shut and you’re confused. Do you experience cognitive symptoms?"
176207431,Getting kind of annoyed with these threads and I don’t annoy easily. Just get it done if you think it will add value to your life. I guarentee it won’t unless you are just doing it for bragging rights. Many of us have high IQs and we struggle just the same. You need to worry more about getting your sz under control.
176207432,Treatment resistant is a good term for the stragglers
176207433,About 12:00 or 1:00 am this morning I heard a weird noise. I didn’t know what it was or where it was coming from. It wasn’t particularly loud but I could hear it clearly. It’s hard to describe but I thought maybe a water pipe had frozen and was making weird sounds. Or the heater was broken. It was a steady moaning sound. I walked in every room trying to find out what it was and where it was coming from. I couldn’t pinpoint it though. Then I realized it was a human making the noise! WTF? I just stood and listened and it droned on; it was eerie and creepie as hell. I just gave up trying to find who was doing it and laid on the couch. I think it was the guy upstairs but I really couldn’t say for sure. All I know was that it was weird and it went on for awhile longer then stopped.
176207434,Did medication not work for you but you eventually find something that did? 4 years ago I was on 40 mg of latuda and no symptoms for 3 years… I started smoking weed and I’ve had psychosis for 2 years even though I quit the weed. I was on 12mg of Invega and 140 mg of latuda. Now I’m on 140 mg of latuda and 8mg of risperidone… what worked for you?
176207435,Oh God no. If i dont get my 12 hours of sleep and take my Quetiapine im an anxious paranoid mess. Im on the monthly jab too - but i gotta do both. Which is why the chemist winds me up when they havent done my refill or decide to close early. They dont realise i rely on the bloody things.
176207436,That’s a hard wake up call
176207437,I Am Intelligent Yes.
176207438,i could so go for some authentic mexican tacos right now
174395553,"Talked with him today. About these voices, he said they are not tipical voices of schizophrenia. He thinks they are more like automatic thoughts. He doesnt know why I have them in social situations. He said it’s kinda weird He upped seroquel to 150 mg only. I thought 200. But he said try with 150. He doesnt think I have schizophrenia though."

176207444,I don’t think I’m disgusted. I just am happy to not have those things in my life.
176207445,"When I was a kid we used to visit Ocean City, Maryland and I’d dive into the waves at the beach. I’d get all salty and then come in and eat Candy Kitchen marshmallow fudge. Those were the good times. I haven’t been to a proper beach since then. I moved to California and my very first summer here was pretty much ruined by the corona virus."
176207446,I was before but I dunno if I would be now or not. Not going to take the chance though.
174395557,Schizophrenia does not necessarily mean brain damage. 1/3 of schizophrenics have a brain that looks just like a healthy brain:
174395562,"Abilify worked for me I had no negative symptoms, normal life, but it gave me addiction and hypersexuality issues. I hope they make a med like Abilify without its side effects…"
176207447,I ate and drank in my room all the time. They weren’t really too strict about it though it was against the rules. We had a 7-11 right next door but people were broke. I loaned money when I could though I was in debt.
174395564,This actually happened and may be evidence that this illness may be something bigger than we thought(lol). This person has schizophrenia
176207448,Thank you sweetie!
176207449,"Wait, you guys actually like the hospital? Lol you guys are crazy. I wish I could think of it more like you all. I hate the hospital. I don’t care how good the food is. They have grocery stores and I can get something good from there if I so desire. I guess it’s a good thing though. Extra motivation to stay on my meds."
176207450,"Saw this thing the other day, some guy accidentally left a pair of glasses in an art gallery and everyone thought it was an exhibit and took pictures, gathered around:’) amuses me immensely."
176207451,Maybe a change in your sleeping pattern? Is your job really stressful? I know those two things really effect my mental health.
176207452,"No no no! Of he doesnt agree, ask another pdoc to judge the situation and help you slowly taper. Quitting abruptly just means an ambulance ride to the ward… in my case at least."
176207453,I think at this point you need to call 911 and ask for help _AT_MENTION_ .
176207454,"I agree, excellent idea for a thread. I was going for some heart testing at the clinic, and an old lady who looked a little confused was trying to find her surgeon. So I got her. up to the third floor, and sorted it out. I always loved helping the elderly, and it seems like a gift from God to give me the opportunity. Even holding the door open for an old couple always makes me feel good"

174395560,"My sister is a laborer in the construction union. Makes 40 dollars an hour + benefits. 25 years to retire. I couldn’t even do that. She’s tough. I personally think she’ll have to do some other work in some time because it’s really a male job. But she loves it. She wants to be a nurse but doubt that will happen. She’s also an alcoholic… I saw Costco paying $16.50 for warehouse work. I would do that. Probably better than Amazon. It just all depends. I’m better now than 10 years ago but I still got my disability. I don’t need to prove anything to anybody. Plus, I got other things going on besides schizoaffective disorder that I talk about. Maybe when my 3 year review is up in 2 years, I’ll do something else. Maybe the government will be broke or bankrupt by then. I don’t know. I got some options."
174395575,I didn’t get diagnosed till 29. I wasted a lot of years in paranoia and depression. I really was a mess. Smart enough to get in trouble but too dumb to get myself out of it. Medications and diagnosis helped me no end. I could form decent relationships with women and others without the paranoia and strangeness. I was always different and remember serious ocd on the playground in grade 1.

176207468,When I lived in banff as a young adult for awhile I lived in my car. One time all I had was $2 and no food. I bought a loaf of bread and stole a small block of cheese. I felt terrible about it.
176207469,sorry _NAME_. hope you still manage a beautiful day.
176207470,Polite disagreement. I wasn’t good at public speaking and I had a tremendous fear of it. I’ve pushed hard in this area and now I do well speaking and presenting. The ability to communicate well is important for professional advancement.
176207471,How long did it take to work for you?
176207472,Besides my sza and tons of phobias… A permanently congested nose Bad teeth (three missing and another needing to be extracted) A long-time cyst on my private parts Other than that I’m ok (I hope so!) I’m very bad with going to doctors and dentists (except pdocs).
176207473,flagging again mr…?
176207474,"I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . It’s good to motivate yourself and push yourself, but it can have a negative impact. Speaking from experience, pushing yourself can result in stress. As you set the bar higher and higher, you’re forced to accomplish the goals that you’ve set yourself. Dont push it. Set a goal and hold it.If you think you’re ready for the next step, plan your next goal. Listen to your body, dont over stimulate yourself."
176207475,I hope this drug is good
176207476,Yeah I see my pdoc in a week. If these symptoms don’t get better by then I’ll go back up to 3.5mg. My symptoms are getting worse not improving over time.

176207480,"I’ve had this delusion during my psychotic break. I can tell you that, audiences do get referenced, and talked to by the casters and stuff, but its nothing unnatural, they get payed to. They get paid by the viewers and by ad revenue. They promote their books their recipes, they want you to pay attention, and they try to get your attention. This isn’t nefarious they’re just trying to make a living. If they could afford to talk 1v1 to people I’m sure you’ve seen it, they do. They get people to get through telephones. They can’t hear see or interact with you, without equipment. The people who do interact by talking to their audience do so using phones. There is no way to fully argue yourself out of a belief you only have slight influence on, just in your heart of hearts know that you’re ok. No one is stalking you, you’re safe, and you can be at ease. This is a delusion. Its an unnatural belief that captivates your mind, and you can feel pleasure thinking it, but that doesn’t make it 
true. The truth is you and I have an illness that affects our brains, and we use our brains to do everything, so something like this is par for the course when something goes wrong with it. We just ended up with injured brains. Nothing to do about it, but to take the medicine, and do the cognitive therapies to stop mental decline. You probably watch T.V. that’s cheap and easy to get access to, we’re both in a similar financial situation because of our careers being impacted by this illness, coincidences exist, but we’re also poor schizophrenics most likely. I’m not reading your mind. I’m not in any way really informed about your situation other then from speaking from my own."
176207481,Does anyone else remember all of their dreams? I think its because of the meds im on. Im currently taking Olanzapine and Cipralex. I remember my dreams every time I wake up. They are usually negative and involve me being in life threatning situations. It stresses me out sometimes. I either want to stop remembering them or I want to have more positive dreams.

176207485,"When I was in middle school I was considered gifted, and my mother was told I was about 2 years ahead of my age in my learning of maths, science and english. This put me in all the top classes for my subjects when I joined high school. The only problem is I had behavioural problems and undiagnosed ASD (I got sent home on my first day of primary school) My behaviour at high school got worse when I started hanging around with the older kids, and I ended up smoking and on drugs by age 11. I was exploited pretty badly as I had no social skills, and the teachers basically did nothing about it that was effective I ended up constantly getting suspended, moved schools twice and eventually got told not to come back until exams were due later on in my final year. The reason I post this is that parents and teachers need to be more aware of protecting their children growing up. Maybe ‘gifted’ is the wrong word, but I had very good abilities and a proven track record of being clever, but that quickly faded 
away when I abused my body with drugs, and ended up letting that drive my mental health into the ground as an adult. Things could have been so different, but in the Mid-90’s, they just did not recognise talent enough in schools - or mental health problems - to really harness this. Maybe things have changed now, I really hope they have. Bit of a story of a wasted youth there Fast forward and by 25 I am drug-free and I was graduating University with high grades, but on the other hand, two months later I was told I was also SZ"

My sleep has been problematic because my guilt has been keeping me awake while simultaneously making me exhausted. People make me so angry sometimes, and I try to calm myself, to forgive, but really, I suck at not being angry. I don’t make enough of an effort to be better than I was on days previous; I don’t make enough of an effort to be a good person. It’s strange. My voices really aren’t bothering me much. They mostly just say random sh it. No, it is I myself who fears what I may have been in lives past. Was I a Nazi? A slave owner? Just a general piece of sh it? That’s what I am now, isn’t it?

I was a mess back then but didn’t realize it. was not hallucinating prior to my diagnosis, so it was no big deal, just some anxiety, racing thoughts, and paranoia, and disorganized thinking.

176207547,"Awoke from a lucid hypnagogic experience. I was back in school and was looking for my class schedule. I went to a counselor and she was helping me and then double took me. She said something like, “Do you see a doctor? Because I can see x, y, z (I forget) symptoms on you.” I was caught off guard but in the dream I knew it was true. Then, like my first episode, I started reliving past experiences and “making connections” like a movie character does when they realize “everything has been a lie.” Both my mom and step mom had admitted they thought my dad had a spectrum disorder but I feel I can now see whatever it is, he is probably sz prone. He never drank or used drugs though so avoided a mental break. Regardless, I was spiraling down in the dark of my room. I felt it creeping up. I sat up and turned on the lights and did all I could to remain present. Which was flip up my laptop and come here. Thank you all for being here and communicating regularly. I am so scared of all this, scared of 
meds I will need to take, scared of never being the same. Scared of weight gain and other side effects. Scared of a future of doctors and appointments. But this experienced helped me to accept it. What is crazy is after my Seroquel experience, my clonazepam now has paradoxical effects. I become twitchy and there is minimal sedation. I may take an eighth of a pill before work. All my symptoms are nearly gone during the day time so I should be ok. I am going to get ready and take my dog out. You guys really are helping others and each one of you is very important and I need you."

(Normally called upper class, working class and middle class.) For example where I live the accent changes quite a lot depending on what class you are from even though its geographically the same place.

There are oceans in soundwaves, and alphabets are a way of hacking these oceans to mine information. The so called logos, is an example of the living word, (this is not a religious statement), it evolves and is hacked to produce intelligent design that is a manifestation of peoples delusions. This is the reason we should refrain from talking about religion, unless we want to understand each other in context. Fortune telling is a religious act of hacking, something that was missed from a recent article I read was that the state of war we are in now was foretold some forty generations before by a hacker, whether you believe it or not

I read about prodromal symptoms online and I believed I had these. This is before being diagnosed and I knew what symptoms they would be looking for. I then used a lot of stimulants and it seems my problems got worse. I felt guilty over just acting crazy in the past when I was considered manic. Now my symptoms are worse and I met a man who I thought I was a spy with. I don’t know if I really am or not now. My friend said I did this for attention.

176207636,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , I think you posted to me on another thread that you found peace & forgiveness with your abusive mother & talk with her from time to time. Sorry if I’m remembering that wrong. All my symptoms are my mother abusing me…physically, emotionally, sexually. So I know, as I always did, she’s in the wrong. That’s the wrong thing to do to a kid, especially your own kid. So when my pdoc asks me what is ???? with my symptoms I tell him it is mother dear. He understands she’s ""Cluster B Narcissistic, criminal""and why that makes it so hard for me to relate to any colleague or friend or human. Only problem is, he forgets it from one appointment to the next. I have to start all over again next appointment. Why can’t he take notes and get some continuity happening? Does your pdoc remember what your deal is from one appointment to the next? I feel that we should only have to describe trauma and then that’ll be noted & the pdoc can understand us from that point on."

It’s possible I could work some hours there next summer, when I’m off from teaching, but we’ll see. One night per week is not worth rearranging my sleep and meds schedule every damn week, plus I need to get away from that place completely. It’s been very bad for my mental health, especially these past few months. I don’t really need the income anymore, now that I’m making so much more in the way of teaching pay.

My license got taken away a long time ago. I still think it’s stupid. But I can’t change the laws. How is being on medicine or being sectioned a threat to your existence?

174395614,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Is there a discrete negative symptom syndrome in people who use methamphetamine? A Voce, R _PERSON_, _PERSON_, B Calabria and _PERSON_, Comprehensive psychiatry , Jun 28 2019 Positive psychotic symptoms have consistently been associated with methamphetamine use but the presence of a negative symptom cluster remains unclear. We used exploratory factor analysis to examine whether a discrete negative syndrome could be delineated among methamphetamine users, and to examine the clinical correlates of this syndrome.Participants (N?=?154) were people who used methamphetamine at least monthly and did not meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for lifetime schizophrenia. Scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for the past month were subject to exploratory factor analysis. Latent class analysis was applied to resultant factor scores to determine whether negative and positive factors were experienced by the same participants. Past-month substance use measures were days of use for each drug typ
e and methamphetamine dependence assessed using the Severity of Dependence Scale.We articulated a three-factor model including 'positive/activation symptoms' (e.g. suspiciousness, hallucinations, conceptual disorganisation, tension), 'affective symptoms' (e.g. depression, anxiety) and 'negative symptoms' (e.g. blunted affect, motor retardation). Positive-activation and affective symptoms (but not negative symptoms) were positively correlated with past month days of methamphetamine use (r?=?0.16; r?=?0.25) and severity of dependence (r?=?0.24; r?=?0.41). Negative symptoms were correlated with heroin (r?=?0.24) and benzodiazepine use (r?=?0.21). Latent class analysis revealed a three-class model comprising a positive-symptom class (44%, high positive-activation, low negative symptoms), a negative-symptom class (31%, low positive-activation, high negative symptoms), and a low-symptom class (38%, low on all factors).A negative symptom syndrome exists among people who use methamphetamine, but this appears related 
to polysubstance use rather than forming a part of the psychotic syndrome associated with methamphetamine use. Overlooking the role of polysubstance use on negative symptoms may conflate the profiles of methamphetamine-associated psychosis and schizophrenia."

I took excedrin migraine which helped a little but wound up seeing a neurologist who prescribed [something; sorry can’t remember] but it actually worked.

176207738,"Hey, _AT_MENTION_. I’m white, and while I’m sure I have prejudices, I don’t have a problem with other races. I don’t and never will know what it’s like to be black or be scared at a routing traffic stop like black people are. I will not even pretend to understand, because I don’t and can’t. I’m from Texas, but I lived outside of Atlanta for a while, and everyone hated everyone. I’d never experienced anything so… blatant. The problem wasn’t that people hated ME. The problem was that people assumed that, because I was white like them, I’d agree with their backwards thinking about other races. I worked at a spiffy fast food place with a mostly black crew. I had so, so many people trash talk my very nice co-workers to me right in front of said co-workers. I’d get mad, really mad. I liked my co-workers, some of them as close friends. They’d tell me to keep my mouth shut, to smile and nod because it didn’t matter- they were used to it. But it DOES matter. They shouldn’t ha
ve to be quiet and listen to that. I think hearing their acceptance of the way things were then (it’s been, like 15 years, but I bet it’s just as bad if not worse) was what broke my heart. I know that people will hate, but that felt they had to just shut up and listen to that… wrong. So, so wrong. In Texas, we could have refused them service. I don’t know what the law was/is in GA, but I was told not to do that when I first tried. There are a lot of protests and stuff in the city (I’m not too far from _PERSON_). I am scared to check the news because I don’t want to read about more cops killing or hurting people, but I’m just as scared not to know what’s going on. My husband tells me what’s happening usually. Not all cops are bad, but… my husband told me about this thing he read or saw. Saying most cops are good at their job isn’t acceptable. People wouldn’t accept it if most pilots were good- except for the few who like to crash into mountainsides- but otherwise, you can trust pilots. 
No one would ever fly. But it’s okay with cops to have a few who crash into mountains, if you will? No. It’s just not. Anyhow, the point to too all of that is that not all white people are racist. I don’t know if that came across. Like I said, I don’t get it and never will, but I believe in ""love thy neighbor’, and not “love thy neighbor that looks like thyself”."

174395645,"Hello _AT_MENTION_… We’re struggling with the same things. Since developing schizophrenia in my 40s (I’m 65 now) I don’t think there has been a day when I haven’t wondered what am I doing with my life (I’m not accomplishing much in the real world… although my wife and I love each other very much and have a great relationship) according to the usual measurements. I’m very interested in writing too and have some good story ideas but I’m not disciplined enough to actually write. I understand the frustration and the struggle associated with getting to know yourself. And yeah, you hit it on the head with your insightful opening line, “Self acceptance is a hard one.” For me that is very, very true. I’m always trying to regain what I had and was doing before my diagnosis. But like you imply, accepting where I am right now is the hard part and then building from there might be easier. Thanks for sharing your thoughts in your post."
176207746,"Yes, maybe. But is it necessary?"
176207747,I get sleepy from my latuda aswell. I take mine with dinner but have recently started taking them with a snack just before bed because I was in bed to early. I don’t throw up. I agree you could go back to what you were doing before. Two toast should be enough depends what you have on them.
176207748,I say go for it
176207749,"Have you talked to your doctor about readjusting meds to try to help with that? I understand it’s scary trying different medications, but there could be something out there that could help your symptoms. I recently adjusted meds and it helped me a lot. I was scared, don’t get me wrong, but sometimes I think we get stuck thinking there’s no way to improve how we feel when there could be solutions out there."
176207750,i can’t. i can go out but in a very severe state that i think people can notice that i got some problems by just looking at me. not really functional at all.

176207754,"I have had unprotected sex 15 months ago and I did get some easily treated STI, also i was tested for other diseases and came out negative. Hence it was only 2-3 weeks after a infection, but I had simple blood tests when I got hospitalized and they did not tell me anything. However before nose surgery I had also a blood test and doctor said that it looks like you have a virus, looks like a flu, but your body is dealing well with it. But I didn’t feel ill or anything, just my white blood cell count was higher than normal. So can you tell if you have HIV from a simple blood test?"

176207757,"I haven’t touched alcohol in November. No cravings or temptation. I am a binge drinker so I’m pleased with the no drinking and feeling healthier. I want this to continue not drinking, small steps so doing December first. I want to stop drinking soda too as think I’ve increased the Coke and Pepsi drinking. This way I’ll lose weight as think I haven’t lost any in November. I think I’ll find no soda the hardiest. Going to replace it with only 2 mugs of coffee a day. Anybody else gave up alcohol and soda. Am I doing things too fast?"
174395647,"Hello _PERSON_, I’m sorry to hear that you describe yourself as “just a blob of schizophrenia”. However, I can relate to you saying that you get overwhelmed so easily. It is indeed easy to get overwhelmed with schizophrenia. Stress, even a little bit, is a major trigger for many of us. It’s hard for other people to understand. It is also easy to get tired and be moody with SZ but may I suggest that a little bit of exercise may do you some good. You may feel significant improvements in cognitive functioning even after just 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise. Best wishes…"

174395657,I wasn’t when I was on Abilify. Now on Risperdal I can’t work at all anyway.
176207766,I’m 100% honest with my psychiatrist and I don’t mind if he sends me to the hospital. When doctors send us to hospital it’s because this is the best for us.
176207767,"Well, I’ll be getting the same amount of calories. And enough protein. The only things I’ll be low on is sodium and fiber. So I think it will be ok for a couple of days. If I feel weird I’ll eat real food."
174395659,I drive but it was a battle getting my licence. Once they see schizophrenia on your medical records here they won’t give it to you. So I had to take them to court.

176207769,will you take the vaccine? I’m not sure… I think i’ll prob take it but if they come with some chip to prove you have taken the vaccine i’ll pass.

174395660,"1mg of Abilify doesn’t seem much at all to me. The dose range for Sz is 10mg too 30mg. I know they need to start off slow, but this seems to be a bit too cautious."
176207771,"I thought that if anyone one went into my bros room they would die due to ‘severe oppression’ So I threw my brother’s stuff out of his room at 4am I woke him up told him he needed to get out of his room immediately. I threw his dresser out his bed and stuff Any time I went in there I felt an icy hand grab my neck and choke me. Then I went ballistic and was flailing on the floor screaming and crying when my dad said he was going to go in the room. Like full psycho. This went on for hours. They locked me in my room to figure out what to do with me. Also when everyone else was crying because of me and the experience, I’d just be smiling happily and saying oh that’s great your being healed. It was traumatic. It was ?????? up bat ???? crazyness. Unfortunately I continued in psychosis for another 6 months with lesser degrees of it. I’m over it now. I had a bit of PTSD from it and so did my mom. Anytime I heard someone cough I thought they were crying for quite a while."
176207772,"Yes, you can have ptsd caused by your psychosis I forget the specific name of it but it is something simple like psychosis related ptsd. Unfortunately many mental health professionals are unaware of how deeply traumatizing psychosis can be. It took me years before I was officially diagnosed. Professional after professional would tell me that I had symptoms of having undergone severe trauma but were confused when I told them I had never been abused or anything like that. The thing is I HAD been abused, but it was psychosis so in their eyes it “didn’t count”. More professionals need to be educated on psychosis related ptsd. I did a poll on here once asking who if anyone had felt traumatized by their psychosis and the responses were overwhelmingly in the yes portion, I think like 84% or something I can’t remember. You are not alone."

174395676,I notice the article is 7 years old.
174395664,It depends on the diagnostic manual being used. In the DSM there must be at least 1 month of acute phase symptoms and a minimum total duration of 6 months. In the ICD there only needs to be a total of 1 month.

174395669,"My paternal grandma likely had undiagnosed and untreated sz/a. She had intense mood swings like the ones I deal with and had delusions of being a prophet that she couldn’t be reasoned out of. She seemed perpetually unaware of social cues, much like me. These problems could make her a bit difficult to be around at times. Unfortunately, in spite of all these issues, she never relented to seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist; instead, she chose to self-medicate with alcohol and valium. What really drove home that this was probably her affliction in life was that, during her final days, I found a pamphlet about dealing with a loved one with schizophrenia on her table that had likely been left by a hospice nurse. When I saw that, I knew someone had picked up on the same signs that I did. It’s just unfortunate that her symptoms came to some sort of medical attention too late. Leaves me wondering if I could have talked with her about our shared issues when she was in better physical health. If she’
d been willing to listen. If I could have convinced her to get help, too, because my life had been so greatly improved by it and she deserved a good life too. Been a melancholic past few days. As always, thanks for reading. (Side note: I’m certainly no expert and I don’t want to seem like I’m giving her a definitive diagnosis. But there was definitely something that she was dealing with that needed attention. I’m mourning the fact that she never received closure or help for that. I don’t know why I’m dwelling on all these depressing things lately.)"

174395680,_AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry you had that experience. Hope your current meds are helping with minimal side effects. _AT_MENTION_ Basically every med that’s ever worked for me eventually stopped working. Even happened with clozapine. I was so fed up I’ve been off antipsychotics for 8 months now. I’m back at a point where I’m willing to try some more.
176207802,"Distractions. When I quit my vape a month ago, I had a bad habit of waking up in the morning and smoking with my coffee. So I did other things. I love cleaning, so I clean but you can distract yourself with small things, watch a video, go for walk, try to learn something online, explore new music. Just do something that requires action. That’s what helped me."
176207803,"Aw thanks _AT_MENTION_. I’m kinda glad to be back too Do you believe that coincidences have some kinda special meaning yourself? Me myself I’m not sure yet, though I’ve started to read up a bit about _NAME_ and I think he might have a strong opinion on it which will be interesting to discover. There was a time in my life when I felt like I experienced some strange synchronicities or coincidences but nowadays it’s not so much like that anymore. But I used to be absolutely fascinated by those that I experienced that I had even written them down to keep a record.

176207831,"I’m probably just being a ????? but I want to get this off my chest. I feel resentments starting to build and that’s never a good thing so I need to get myself straight. Since I got here my ex has been slowly buying less and less of the groceries and household items. It’s been weeks since he’s spent any money. He’s putting all the weight on me and my credit cards. You have to understand I supported him for 10 years while we were married and I’m not interested in doing it anymore. I’m not buying anymore groceries until he starts buying his fair share. I’ll just eat my Slimfast or cereal or something. And somehow cooking food seems to have become my responsibility again. I don’t want to have to cook for other people if I’m not in the mood. Don’t get me wrong, I love to cook if I’m in the mood. I especially love to cook for my son and show him I care by making him a nutritious meal. But when I don’t want to cook neither one of them will cook, they just go hungry. It makes it 
uncomfortable for me to make something for myself. I’m going to have to explain to them that I don’t always feel like cooking for them. And since there’s no working vehicle, getting rides to go get cigarettes, or toilet paper, or groceries or whatever is a task. I seem to be the only one putting any effort into finding solutions to getting rides. That really makes me upset. It’s like all the responsibility is on me. I’m not doing it anymore. I did it all for 10 years. It’s time he does his fair share for a change. I’m tired of being the one to worry and plan. thanks for the rant."

My dad took me there constantly for his narcissistic supply. I took meds in high school and they messed me up. Im not buying the genetic explanation just not like im buying fake news propaganda anymore. Luckily, I have my mom, brother, sister, and extended family. Both my dad and step father have been problems in my life. Seems to be a man problem for me. My step father is better with emotions, and my dad is more responsible as he is leaving me money after he dies so I’m not homeless and have more than just ssi. I’m eternally blessed and grateful. Hopefully society gets better and recovers. Im worried about 2021. I have aspergers syndrome which I believe can look like narcissism. Schizophrenia can look like autism too even though they are opposite conditions. I feel lucky I have aspergers as im more logical than most and dont halluci

176207885,"I saw this in my studying, I had to study much more even preparing my university semesters by studying my books in the summer before semester starts. I still couldn’t fully grasp the material. I felt dumb, I would read a page and then after a few minutes I already forgot lots of stuff. I used to read a page once and highlighting improtant stuff to memorize it 100%. After sz I had to read and rewrite the same page in my own words many times to understand max 60% of it. I still got my kinesiology degree but didn’t have the grades to do a master to specialize in physiotherapy. Not many jobs I can do now with my degree except for teaching which I suck at now after sz anyways."

174395698,When I went schizo my drug use came to an end. I quit talking to everyone I knew was associated with drugs. I was to paranoid to leave the house to get drugs. I spent 9 months hiding in the basement. Drugs consumed my life for years and when I got out of the hospital I felt free. After losing touch with reality I had a new found appreciation for it. Getting schizophrenia was a blessing and a curse. It sucks having it but at the same time it’s what got me clean. I haven’t touched drugs in 20 years. I wish I had some answers for you but I don’t. I hope you find the help you need.

174395707,"It has been over a year since i was last in hospital, and have now been stabilised with the medication. However, i still do have negative symptoms. I struggle with avolition every day. It really takes a lot for me to get up and go. Usually when i make a commitment to do one thing, something else suffers. I can’t do too many things at the same time. I have some apathy. I really do not put much effort into my appearance. I have some anhedonia at times, but this at least has reduced. I do not socially isolate myself at the moment, but that is because i’m forcing myself to be more sociable. However, when it comes to cognition, i have some issues there too. Difficulty processing too much information, i tend to forget half of it and then have to ask for it to be repeated. Sometimes i have trouble concentrating, especially if there are a couple of things competing for my attention. My speak is also sometimes affected. I say things that i don’t mean, and i don’t always recognise when i say somethin
g inappropriate. Still, i try to keep on the positive. I do as much as i can, and just work with it."

176207931,"The biggest step was to stop evading the issue and admit I had mental health issues Once that hapenned, I complied with the meds and my sanity returned and situation improved Also, big help was to have the support of my immediate family and to listen to the professionals who tried to help me like mental health nurses and psychologists"
176207932,I kinda wrote this guy a ton of messages and it was stupid I didn’t like him. And he never responded …especially after I got on the meds I realised I didn’t like him . At the time though I was writing to him every moment like I fell in love with an idea of him not him … thought he was listening to me and that’s how I felt we had a connection. I making no sense am I.
176207933,You need to develop good study habits such as reading a set amount every day and you need to plan everything out in advance. You need to do this to reduce all the stressors as much as you can.
176207934,You’re practically related.

Also, it pains me to admit it, but I am capable of being just plain wrong. But there was some prominent socialist who decried all the weirdos socialist rallies attracted.

I improved a lot of things over the years like DP/DR and solipsism to some extent where it doesn’t bother me anymore. The only thing I cannot get over is the lack of motivation thing. I can do stuff but it’s not like I’m superman anymore. I am 100x slower doing things and sometimes put things off for months. I don’t know if I’ll ever get a job and recover. I’m looking into a BS in cyber security and hopefully could make $70-80k working at a small company perhaps even AT&T or something, although I doubt it given my current trajectory and symptoms. I talked to my family about it and I need to show them I can take care of myself including hygiene, keeping my room clean, driving, and perhaps volunteering or working a part time job making minimum wage at a place like mcdonalds. I sometimes am grandoise and delusional in what I can do with my life. I would like to get the degree online some d

176208036,"It’s quite the opposite. I’m not gonna give names, but there was this one website I used in 2016 that mocked me when I was delusional with memes and just recently I got booted off because I lost it when other users were laughing at me and told one of them to kys so they would ban me. On another website I talked about one time I quarreled with my mother and they banned me just for saying that. This other website I got put under excessive moderation after I requested to be banned because I didn’t like how judgmental some users were to me, and just recently I had a one time stunt with this other suicide website where I discussed my violent tendencies and they deleted it so I asked for other websites and announced that I was leaving so they kicked me off there too. People on the internet are assholes, I don’t know what the mystery is there. People can be so ??????? judgmental. And while you could say that I’m lying or twisting things, at the same time I would’ve showed you exactly what I wa
s talking about but I didn’t take any screenshots, so you’re just gonna have to take my word."
174395743,"Uh, you’re probably normal in some ways. But…you may be feeling normal presently but what about your history when it comes to mental health? I hate to be negative but the reality for people who have been mentally ill for years and then feel “normal” for few days is that your history speaks for itself. Just read back some of the stuff you’ve written on here in the past and you will see why doctors think you’re mentally ill. You can rationalize your symptoms as stuff that everybody goes through but the problem with us is the degree we go through all this mental health stuff. “Normal” people may hear a voice occasionally or get paranoid on rare occasions, maybe have one or two inserted thoughts but we go through this stuff most of the day, every day. This stuff dominates are life constantly for years, that is the difference between us and the non-schizophrenic’s. Using this reasoning and using myself as an example: I know that so-called “normal” people may have a crisis one day i
n their life and could even conceivably end up in a psyche ward or emergency room for a few hours. But I spent eight months in a hospital. Normal people may need a Xanax on rare occasions but I need powerful anti-psychotics every day just to function. Normal people may not trust their neighbors occasionally; but me and other people with schizophrenia build a huge case about how they are constantly bugging us. These are just a couple of reasons why me and other schizophrenics are considered mentally ill. So yes, you can argue that most normal people experience the exact same stuff we do but we experience all the stuff to the millionth degree and for most of this weird mental stuff we live with, it ain’t going away. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but years and years of mental illness and taking medication is not going to be nullified because we have a few good days where we feel fine. It’s no mistake or accident that we need medication, therapy, and much help and support."

There haven’t been that many outstanding smart people throughout history and it kinda raises my suspicion. What special knowledge do I think they have? I never said that. I don’t think that our government is trying to monitor schizophrenics but maybe some entity out there that is trying to keep us from thriving.

176208067,ah i was lucky that i got put on disabilty… the annoying thing was i had to go for checkup ever 2 years and then they asked you so many questions but last time i went that person said he would put me on a list that the check ups didn’t have to happen anymore. Where do you get your income from now?

176208069,I was watching batman Vs superman trailer when they came and forced me into the _NAME_. I thought they were going to kill me because I am an alien.
176208070,Way to go! It feels so good to have your hard work acknowledged
174395739,is it fish oil omega 3 and 6…??
176208071,"I completely forgot the first part of your post when I wrote my last reply. In reference to what you first stated, yes, I do have trouble talking in person. I am much, much better now that I am medicated, though. Before I was medicated, I could hardly carry a conversation at all. It was bad."
176208072,Yeah… glad someone understands my feelings. Do you work or anything??
176208073,my cat is my princess and when i had thoughts about harming her i was so distressed i ended up in a&e! so i definitely feel like my kitty cat is partly my reason for life.
176208074,"So today I read some more five “element”/“phase” theory, did some work on my maths paper, practiced some t’ai ji and studied in more depth the first disease of the heart from my book on the purification of the heart. It’s been quite a productive day. I want to have a similar day tomorrow. Thank you."
176208075,In the 27 years I’ve had the disorder I’ve only had 2 months long breaks from at least having some psychosis every day. I don’t want to bum you out but that is a possibility. You may have to learn to live with the voices. On the other hand the meds may stop the voices for longer than that. There is little chance it will go away on its own.
176208076,is it possible to recover and date a former care giver or am i being stupid?
176208077,And what else do you consoder beautiful?
176208078,"I said it. I’m not great at going out at the best of times but a combination of fear of COVID/fear of inadvertently breaking social distancing due to poor spatial awareness, and lower back pain, has combined to make things a lot worse."
174395756,"Its easy to say but most szics will refuse meds and the fact that they’re ill, its part of the illness. I only realized that I needed meds after I was about to die from suicide bcz of the voices."

176208080,Oh right. Give it like two months for the medicine to do its magic. Before considering raising the dose. But I’m no pdoc ask ur pdoc what he she thinks. Yes I’ve only ever been on aripiarzole Are u on aripiarzole? It took months to go away two months. Then more milder paranoia stayed for a while longer and now I still have some ‘mild’ paranoia but its manageable atm
176208081,I keep saying mine is like a horror mov8e in my pants for a few days.
176208082,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. My dr usually asks open ended questions and I never know exactly what I should say. I mean the time is short so what’s most important to say? That’s always my dilemma.
176208083,I’ve been on Geodon for about a decade and a half. It still keeps working.
176208084,"thanks for your reply, i am glad you got what i was trying to say, that was a very good response"
174395746,Yeah I was in a band before I got schizophrenia then I basically got replaced and my friends don’t hang out with me anymore
176208085,What do you think _AT_MENTION_ ? Tell me it’s not real. Please don’t lock this
176208086,Squirrelete is very clever indeed!
176208087,No. You should were clothes when bathing and walk around in nothing but cloves and a face mask.

176208092,Hey _AT_MENTION_ long time no talk whats up?
176208093,"I am sorry about what you are dealing with. Typically its the thyroid is the most common culprit explination for unexplained weight gain. You mentioned you were on metforman, that is a diabetic medication and AP’s have been known to raise insulin levels. Suga deposits as fat in the body. Therefore I would recommend you consult a degistered dietetian as soon as possibleto do a dietary inventory and focus on your caloric expenditure. Becasue as long as it is negative you will lose weight. You may just have to increase your amount of exercise to get there. But it is possible to lose weight by doing so. I would also recommend you meet with a doctor that spcialises in metabolic disorders before you gain anymore weight"
176208094,"That’s what I think but maybe it should be kind of more subliminal the messages. Like a cryptic way somehow. Make it seem real catchy and simple but deep down it’s like some sheer brilliant madness or something lol well I think some rappers do that. Like _NAME_, _PERSON_, _NAME_. The elite rappers these days blend it well. Maybe I just have too much emphasis on the lyrics…?? Ps the guy showed his music and I commented I thought it was sick and he should check it out. He gave me compliments but this was the criticism he gave. He was definitely more experienced than me he was probably 40 years old."
176208095,"Look, it seems like it’s just 2mg less but it’s more than just a lower dose, the effect of 6mg vs 4mg can be vary a lot, you really need an expert to tell you what dose to take, it could be not just a ‘lower effect’."
174395754,I find the pulsating vibration to be annoying. And the synthetic sound is annoying too.

176208099,"For schizophrenics, not much worse."
176208100,"Maybe it’s your fear of jail. Jail isn’t as scary as they make it out to be, still sucks, but it was a fear I had to conquer myself. Jail in Canada sounds cozy and polite! Not that I’m encouraging criminality, but just sayin. I don’t think you’re gonna get arrested in Canada."

176208104,"I bought some Always pads for light period flow but I got them for when I sneeze and I leak, well I put one on this morning and of course I haven’t sneezed all day. wtf. I normally sneeze like 20 times an hour. I guess I found the cure for sneezing. lol."
176208105,"It slows your brain,you think better but your slower in speeds.I play soccer and was slower because of meds"
176208106,"And finally proved it true. I go to doctors a LOT. And now I know that, “The beauty and sexiness of the attending female nurse, doctor or intern is directly proportional to the degree of how embarrassing and invasive the the procedure is,” it never fails. I mean who wants to lay naked face down on a table while a pretty blonde looks at your ass? Any time I see my urologist, it is inevitable that the nurse will be attractive. Any time I go to a doctor and they stick a tube or a camera into some orifice of mine, I know that the woman doctor will be drop dead gorgeous. I just got back from having a scan of my nether regions. The attending nurse was this 28 year old cute intern. I had to have my bottom half buck naked as she grabbed my testicles for twenty minutes while taking pictures (and as a paranoid sidenote, I hope hope she doesn’t post the pictures on the internet, lol.). But yeah, I have some other awkward procedures I need done in the upcoming few weeks and I have no doubts the nurses wi

176208107,Sounds like you need long term cbt therapy for your anxiety disorder. That’s what I’m getting for my ptsd and it’s helping me. I’ve been doing it for 5 years.
176208108,Because if it is schiz I should probably be on antipsychotics
176208109,Do you have a vpn service. If it loads on that it would tell you something
176208110,"I started working again since January and so far I have enjoyed it. You get to meet new people and it gives you something to do with your spare time. My job is pretty stress free though, I am mostly driving around listening to the radio. If you are asking for advice I would say with sz you have to put your well-being first, and how you go about that is up to you."
176208111,Fair enough Sad to hear you have reached that conclusion
176208112,I agree that my observations undoubtably have confirmation bias. But I think possibly the moon theorem has a tiny degree of merit

176208114,"It just feels really unnatural to me, even after all these years. But maybe this is what it’s like for normies."
176208115,Hi guys! I know you’ve probably wondered where I got to. I saw _AT_MENTION_ was one of them lol! Anyway long story short I’ve been in hospital since 24 Dec. Six days in psych ward then two weeks in acute ward of state psych hospital where I was bored out of my mind and had no phone access. Now two days ago I was moved to therapy ward and spending a few weeks here trying to sort out my mess. I’m a f@#$ing mess. The decision to divorce has derailed me completely but I’m slowly coming to healing. It will be a long way still. I’ll probably be in hospital till mid Feb or so. I do have access to my phone now but only two hours a day so can’t reply much. Will let you know what goes on but saw pdoc twice today and whole team and the nurse so far has said the pdoc wants to put me on antidepressant as well to help with my very low mood and high anxiety. I think he will see me tomorrow about that.
176208116,"Yes, that’s what I am thinking"
