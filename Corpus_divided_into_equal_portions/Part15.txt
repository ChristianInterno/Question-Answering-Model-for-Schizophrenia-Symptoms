176045205,"Hey, I know it can be really frustrating trying to find meds that work for you. I know you’re young I think in other threads you said you were 15? I was either 14 or 15 when I had been diagnosed with general psychosis. When you develop psychosis at such a young age it can be difficult for pdocs to find the right balance of meds. Your brain is still developing and they dont want to give you anything that would hinder that development. There is also a whole buttload of hormones that your body is creating that can seriously mess up your mood and even decision making. All those hormones become a factor too. It took a little bit for my pdoc to finally find the right balance for me. So as much as it sucks just try to be patient. And I do know that it really really sucks."

I turned it down because I couldn’t quit the drinking before the test. It would interfer with the testing. Not sure if they thought I was malingering or not, but the doc thought I could be inattentive type based on the appointment. I don’t need adderall anyways. Too many bad past life memories of trying it. Part of me thinks it would turn me productive and make me smarter (like monsters) but I value consistency over short bursts of learning. I think I would forget the information learned once off adderall. Not sure though. I’m happy without it. I got schizophrenia or whatever too. The current doctor said no because the meds do the opposite. I’m sure it’s a malpractice or lawsuit if he messes up and insurance issues. Doctors are v
ery hesitant now a days. The whole making me smarter thing is a myth and a lie. Just like the monsters are fake energy and don’t do anything and it’s not real ????. I’m sure I would see some benefit but it’s not worth the 10% chance of getting permanent psychosis again. It took years of recovering from 1 10 or 15 mg pill one time. That and I think I got other stuff going on. It took like a year on Vraylar to make me recover a bit. It took a long ass time. I rather try alpha brain even though it’s weaker and very expensive now.

176045257,"cureus.com Catatonic Schizophrenia: Cases with Possible Genetic Predisposition Catatonic schizophrenia is defined by catatonia seen either with alternating phases of stupor and motor rigidity or the extreme phase of catatonic excitement. This variant of schizophrenia has been identified with poor prognosis, mainly due to the... Some of the most common signs of catatonic schizophrenia are certain mannerisms, grimacing, stereotypy, and mutism [3]. However, the diagnosis remains confined to the clinical assessment rather than being limited to the signs and symptoms mentioned above. Moreover, this variant of schizophrenia has been identified with poor prognosis, mainly due to the higher association with negative symptoms and young age onset [4]. The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry (13th Edition) supports the use of second-generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole and olanzapine for catatonia associated with psychotic symptoms [18]. Our treatment was in accordance with the guidelines and 
aligns with the group of cases where antipsychotics proved efficacious. Olanzapine administered to our 30-year-old patient has previously been successful in treating chronic catatonia [19]. Correspondingly, Kirino E recorded aripiprazole to be effectual in treating catatonic schizophrenia in an adolescent male [20], and our case of the 18-year-old patient concurs with this result. However, in comparison to aripiprazole, our case demonstrated olanzapine to be quicker in alleviating catatonic symptoms, especially mutism. You told abilify (aripiprazole) found useful for negative symptoms. Did you tried zyprexa (olanzapine)?"

I can make up reasons why I think they are out to ruin me or just want to use me, but the fact is that real relationships are built on trust and sharing and working together. I think when I am closed off and not communicating with others on a real level I am just being self centered and only thinking about my well being instead of how the other person might feel.

176045307,"_AT_MENTION_ I’m not trying to be mean, but I would hardly call you symptom-free. You frequently struggle with the delusion that you’re about to win boatloads of money. It affects you. You also still have a drinking problem. I worry quitting Zyprexa will only exacerbate these problems. If you’re looking to lose weight and live longer, give up the alcohol first."
176045308,Holding an electrical job and security job would put you in the lower social economic class segment of the pyramid. There are executives at major corporations that earn 6-digit figure salaries that would cover the incomes of both your jobs but not to mention these executives have attained Master of Business Administration degrees.
176045309,Not like a dr does.
176045310,"The worst i have ever felt was when the police were taking me into the hospital and i went into hysterics it took me what seemed like forever to calm down my eyesight was all blurred at that point too i didnt let him take me though i think i was possessed with something, no joke."
176045311,"Oh, I know. I’m usually hypomanic."
176045312,thanks for the heads up _AT_MENTION_
176045313,"At present it is like a constant inner monologue of various issues. Kind of annoying. I might go back on meds if this doesn’t resolve in a few days, or gets worse."
176045314,I’m only afraid around kids if I’m driving and they’re around the street because they’re unpredictable and I don’t know if they’re going to jump in front of the car all of a sudden.
176045315,Tried 150mg of suntheanine first time yesterday and felt significant increase for about two hours. After that I haven’t really felt the same release of chemicals. Should I up it to 300mg twice a day?
176045316,Odd that not everyone is obsessed.
176045317,"In my case to be honest it happens both ways. I’m just as likely to compulsively take neutral things in as negative and also neutral things as positive. I feel that if I am forced to be paranoid about persecution, why not balance my self-esteem when random things feel like they are signs of good things in my life. After all, low self-esteem and neuroticism are risk factors for psychosis."
176045318,I read on reviews they only last a month… anyone relate to this? I have nightmares normally so I wouldn’t want to make any worse…

176045320,"What kept me going during my worst days where I had a headache so bad I thought I was going to die, for 5 bloody years, on top of vicious SZ symptoms, was morbid curiosity, and dogged persistence. I just wanted to see how bad things could get. They eventually got better but I had to scrape obscure corners of the web to find better solutions than APs."
176045321,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ ! Don’t see you on the forum as much anymore. We miss you. As for me, I haven’t done much today."
176045322,"I was talking to my friend on the phone and she said people are saying God is punishing us, she said don’t you think this is in the Bible? Pandemic after another. I had a major freak out as my psychosis had highly religious content and revolved around The Book of Revelations. I don’t go to church, I don’t pray, I don’t practice religion after my Jesus delusion in 2013. Religion is in the past for me. I run as fast as possible."
176045323,I’m done that’s it this is to triggering for me
176045324,My sisters wedding party is next Saturday. I don’t wanna go I told my mom. She said I can come late and leave early but she wants me to go. I don’t get it on that well with any of my family these days except my sza cousin and my brother in laws family.
176045325,My guitar goes to my oldest brother. My favourite _NAME_ jacket goes to my best friend.
176045326,I did that interview today. They didn’t ask me many questions but said they had some other people to talk to and that I should hear something in about two weeks. He said the hours were 7 am to 5 pm though. That’s kinda too early for me. Their crews work a day shift and a night shift.
176045327,_AT_MENTION_ What are they saying?
176045328,"Caffeine suppressed the appetite. I used to drink black coffee to skip meals, back when I was struggling with my eating habits. I wouldn’t recommend it. I didn’t feel physically hungry, but the low blood sugar plus caffeine-induced anxiety made me unpleasant to be around."
176045329,"Hey _AT_MENTION_, you’ve got a lot of solid first hand experience. Thanks for your guidance."
176045330,Thanks crimby……151515
176045331,Today I went for a slow jog with someone. They walked whilst I jogged. It was very good. 45 minutes long through a park. I am proud of my achievement and I desperately hope to continue this trend with slow jogging. Idk if I will be able to cope when I get a job though I dam hope so!!!
176045332,"Mine is usually 95/60 or something terrible like that. It takes me a few tries to stand up some days. It has been like this since birth. Most doctors act like it is an accomplishment, instead of a problem, which is annoying."
176045333,Yay! I’m glad to hear it !
176045334,"If I didn’t trust my therapist I would stop going. The relationship doesn’t really work if you don’t believe in their ability. Looking back I wish I’d kicked up more fuss and been more open about dealing with professionals that didn’t meet my expectations. I just feel like I wasted their time and my time by not being open about how I felt like the relationship/treatment was going. I don’t mean to suggest you should stop turning up, but you should engage in a conversation about your concerns and see what they say. They may even agree with you."
176045335,The apartment and the inlaws house are connected and if their bathroom is being used they just come in and use ours
176045336,"Hi again all. I am still on the forum, i wonder who still thinks of me here lol… I was never very popular here but anyway… I want you to believe me, that we tried everything with my pdoc… I tried all possible meds for 10 years, while believing they’ll do their job… But this didnt happen really… My pdoc ended up by saying to stay on the ap which was the least bad on me and to pay efforts now… My zyprexa maintains me on my feet, but it never pulled me out of my house… Also, its not working at all on my painful physical symptoms, which i have from the illness… I dont want even to develop, that the meds act very differently on me - for instance, the zyprexa doesnt even put me to sleep, its almost like a candy when i take it, so this is strange … In the evenings, i am still alone here, with my paranoia, my dreamy world, which is not from the nice ones and the psychosomatic stuff, which is very, very painful and tiring… Ok, i fight now, but its a shame the meds dont do more on me… 
I wonder if i am alone on this? Hugs all"
176045337,When is your next apt? Tell him what you told us.
176045338,Sometimes i envy species without brains or trees.
176045339,"I’ve been on the LAI med Risperdal Consta for 12 years now and I’ve never gotten NMS from it. In the long ago past, back in the early 90’s, I got some symptoms of NMS from an oral AP while I was in a psych unit. But the staff got me stabilized quickly."
176045340,"ok good to learn a few things about u. u r from south korea but is that where u crurrently live or u r chatting from the US as most members here r from. ok lets chat here till u r comfortable, have no issues. I used to stand first in my class in school and now I am jobless not to mention the illness of sz. Can u imagine how ugly turn can ur life take? I mean I am in the ditch. I know they don’t talk religion/politics here but for me God is only my last hope and also the thing which makes me keep breathing. that’s the only worthwhile thing. otherwise my life is worthless. of course don’t get an impression that I am suicidal or anything bcoz I don’t believe in suicide. I just want my life to get back on track. I always imagined growing up of having a beautiful wife who will cook good food for me and give me gorgeous kids. but alas… anyways I still hope that I will get married by God’s grace. I think my sz is also god given, maybe he wanted to break my ego and tell me who is the boss. when 
r ur final exams? looks like u r still a student maybe a college going girl. good luck with ur exams. I love chatting and more so with like minded people."
176045341,I suppose it’s better than being addicted to crack or gambling.
176045342,"I’m already on Metformin _AT_MENTION_ , but thanks for the suggestion. I would have tried that for sure if I weren’t already on it."
176045343,"Well I got diagnosed, are you saying that I should go off my meds?"
176045344,This is good to work on with a therapist who can lead you in your self discovery journey.
176045345,I do not really talk to people so much so it doesn’t really come up but at family gatherings it has and I just say that I don’t work and hope they don’t do an investigation on me with further questions. I do not feel the need to explain myself anymore that’s cool
176045346,Vaping is better than smoking…
176045347,"The only extra benefit I’ve gotten so far is vocational rehab. Which is paying for my school. But j think you can get this with schizophrenias as well. _PERSON_ wouldnt know about SSI, I am in the application process still."

176045349,Jam 5 23 20
176045350,Yes. Fitting in starts with caring but we withdrawn szs aren’t inclined to show special efforts of caring. Social blunders don’t help any.
176045351,Paranoia!?? I know that old chestnut well. Gets me everytime. Early night with 300mg _PERSON_ gets rid of that for me. I just tend to dip in the evenings - so i bugger off to bed early about 5-6 pm - tho i do most my chores 3-5am in the morning so im tired by then anyway.
176045352,Some insurances don’t cover latuda
176045353,"My mother used to talk to me a lot, now she tries to end phone calls really quickly, and she avoids logging onto Facebook in the morning so I can see when she is awake. I probably shouldn’t have been checking this anyway My care coordinator didn’t bother to call me this week as promised. The rest of my family never call me anymore. I feel so alone in this world. My existence seems pointless. Even though I have my issues with sz, gad and asd, that doesn’t mean that I don’t want to be able to talk to someone I just had an argument with the local mental health line as the guy refused to answer my question of was he reading from a script."
176045354,This topic was automatically closed 7 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.
176045355,"In all honesty, it depends on my mood. I have Major Depression as well as Sz. When my mood is under control, I want to live, and to live a long life. When my mood is bad, I often just want to die so I don’t have to suffer anymore."
176045356,with a cold heart. I need to warm my soul.
176045357,It’s tiring to me when I don’t get to say what’s on my mind.
176045358,"That’s awful. I feel for you. The past can’t be changed unfortunatley. I think everybody has bad memories to look back at, but your childhood history seems particulary bad. I hope you are able to find peace in the presence, although I know it must be difficult."
176045359,BTW: There is now a positive review of Caplyta on that review site mentioned above (not by me).
176045360,Because that’s what I noted about any mentally ill person I met before I was MI myself. An exception was a young man who was a friend of the family. He was just strange.
176045361,"I have no other option, but being bored. I can’t get a suitable job for myself to earn money. Therefore i got to cut down on my needs to function in this society."
176045362,Thank you _PERSON_
176045363,"yeah, I even tried to just will myself to thinking it will help. i did not find any benefit. sometimes sarcosine seemed like it woke me up a bit. but after a while i didnt notice anything and it was inconsistent for me. i can get an affect from caffeine, i am probably a bit caffeine sensitive actually"
176045364,"stresses you out, you have to learn to be more positive. Live more for the day."
176045365,"I sat down with my therapist and told her different kinds of situations that made me anxious. From ones that caused mild anxiety to ones that caused extreme anxiety. We started out imaging me doing these things. Then we went out in public and actually did them, starting with the mild ones first and gradually building up to the more anxiety producing ones. At the time I did this I was receiving treatment at a large medical university so there was a lot of people. She had me do things like ride in a crowded elevator, drop a tray in the cafeteria to bring attention to myself (this was one of the ones I ranked as extreme anxiety), and hold a 2 minute conversation with strangers. She was present the whole time but took her badge off so the people didnt know it was me doing exposure therapy and they didnt know she was my therapist."
176045366,I was bullied all throughout school even when I was in college. It just never stopped.
174353414,"_AT_MENTION_ Hey _PERSON_. I’m pretty sure the Illuminati targeted me while I was a college student in this life. It messed with my mind so bad, I sometimes think I’m on another parallel earth or went back in time or switched planets or was cloned. I feel like I have thought insertions or had an electronic device hooked up to my head and was programmed so these thoughts won’t go away unless it’s a micro-chip constantly downloading crap unless it’s cell-phone towers/satellites doing it 24/7. It’s hard to describe but it feels like I’m in a time loop that I cannot escape for eternity. I wake up every life pretty much at 22 years old (maybe 23) as a schizophrenic like the movie ‘ground hog day’ for lack of a better example. I don’t know why they targeted me. Maybe corporations in silicon valley or something (I went to school in the bay area). Like maybe Bohemian Grove (the people that run the world…). So I cannot escape and I’m in hell and ??????? I’m afraid to talk about it 
all the time. I posted some strange stuff like I smoked pot and I posted I time traveled, talked about being abducted by aliens, and we lived in the matrix, and that’s about it. Lost all my friends. It was on Facebook back in 2011. I was living in a cooperative. I know the Bohemian Grove is where all the powerful people (probably most powerful people) in the world or USA go to run the world and socialize. I know they got a secret space program. Perhaps, I was targeted because they thought I was a time traveler even though I am not. My life was destroyed and I ended up with schizophrenia and probably PTSD. I’m just lucky to be alive and home right now. I died over a trillion times and I worry about my family’s safety. Maybe I was targeted while drunk in San _NAME_ that one night while trying to help my friend or maybe some rich Illuminati students at the school targeted me. I don’t know. I believe I was possibly cloned or had my consciousness replaced. I think they put me through Monarch. Nobody gives 
a ????. I have nightmares from the mental hospital. Maybe it was the Men in Black or the Men in Silicon Valley / Corporations doing it. I don’t know why. I always thought I was _NAME_ or something but I don’t have a time machine. In my past lives, I was sent to _NAME_ by them and other DUMBS and died only to go back in time and reset my life for infinity. There is no closure and no help. These people run EVERYTHING including the government. I was just a normal college kid. I found out that most of these people are not even human, but aliens themselves."
176045368,what meds help you fade the delusion and paranoia? are you aware whn you have delusional phase?
176045369,Exercise. You do it cheaply and it only helps. Hard to get started but regular is good. I’m 50. I moved from a sedatntery lifestyle to being fitter than I was at 30 simply by doing regular exercise. I’ve also started reading everyday.
176045370,Reading coffee with my husband Sleeping late
176045371,I get it that vaping is bad for one’s health. A doctor like that would drive me to drink.
176045372,"My therapist and I spoke about this the other day. Avolition is one of my most prominent negatives. He asked what I was doing to lose weight while I bitched about being a fatty. I told him it’s too cold. “Ahhh, so we’re still having some problems getting moving?” “Umm, yeah, it’s hard for me to get engaged.”"
176045373,"I also had a great dream last night. Not sure if it was betaine related, but I haven’t had good dreams in years."

176045380,"No, that never happened to me."
176045381,its still hard to see people spend money like that if they don’t work. There are so many people who struggle to pay bills they can barely afford the bus pass out my way. I think if I did that without ‘working for my money’ my parents would disown me lol. there pretty old school work ethic though.
176045382,The other caveat was “for over a year and still thriving”
176045383,Low dopamine levels can cause catatonia. So if you are taking strong AP’s it might be one of the reason.
176045384,Dude you are poisoning yourself. This is a major red flag to stop.
176045385,I don’t know then. I just know that things got better when I started to take it.

176045387,I made a chocolate cheesecake
176045388,"My brother and I are just becoming close again. I went away for a long time when my husband was stationed away from our state. When I got back, he had changed into this distant sibling that didn’t care about me anymore. Part of it was my sister in law isolating him from us. Now that he’s a truck driver and is away, he calls and texts and hangs out with me and our parents. His wife doesn’t even visit her own family, so she must’ve had the idea that my brother shouldn’t either. We’ve gotten closer too because we’re both doing direct sales together."
176045389,My brother’s IT company all closed because one of the workers tested positive for coronavirus. My brother don’t have any symptoms so I am safe. He’s working from home via internet.

176045395,What was your hobby?
176045396,Idk. I feel like it is I’m suffering every day cos I’m constantly fighting food. And cos it’s so hard to mesh with people. And most importantly just feel good about myself.
176045397,So I deserve to be treated like that?
176045398,"Yes, your body need some time to adjust to new medicine."

176045404,I’ve been clean for over two months. So I wouldn’t be getting withdrawal. I don’t know anything else that would help with depression. I have a history of bipolar symptoms. So SSRI do tend to make me manic or give me mood swings and worsened depression I took lexapro I long time ago I recall I was hearing voices and anxious all the time until I went off that. Then psychiatrist was frustrated with me.

176045408,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Dietary electrolytes are related to mood. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and A _PERSON_, The British journal of nutrition , Nov 2008 Dietary therapies are routinely recommended to reduce disease risk; however, there is concern they may adversely affect mood. We compared the effect on mood of a low-sodium, high-potassium diet (LNAHK) and a high-calcium diet (HC) with a moderate-sodium, high-potassium, high-calcium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-type diet (OD). We also assessed the relationship between dietary electrolytes and cortisol, a stress hormone and marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. In a crossover design, subjects were randomized to two diets for 4 weeks, the OD and either LNAHK or HC, each preceded by a 2-week control diet (CD). Dietary compliance was assessed by 24 h urine collections. Mood was measured weekly by the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Saliva samples were collected to measure cortisol. The change in mood between the preceding CD a
nd the test diet (LNAHK or HC) was compared with the change between the CD and OD. Of the thirty-eight women and fifty-six men (mean age 56.3 (sem 9.8) years) that completed the OD, forty-three completed the LNAHK and forty-eight the HC. There was a greater improvement in depression, tension, vigour and the POMS global score for the LNAHK diet compared to OD (P < 0.05). Higher cortisol levels were weakly associated with greater vigour, lower fatigue, and higher levels of urinary potassium and magnesium (r 0.1-0.2, P < 0.05 for all). In conclusion, a LNAHK diet appeared to have a positive effect on overall mood. Low-sodium, high-potassium diet had positive effect on overall mood. I think an avocado has 1 gram of potassium. Bananas have 200-300 mg of potassium. The daily intake of potassium is really absurd though which is absurd because it’s around 3 grams. I eat a good amount of electrolytes daily and I have a pretty good mood."

176045416,I will recover I am a good person I deserve to be loved by someone I am calm and grateful for life
176045417,"It did absolutely nothing for me, I just lied in bed wide awake and I didn’t even get the high my doctor warned me about. It was like taking nothing. Then again, I just spent the past hour trying to sleep after taking a lunesta, so maybe I’m an anomaly."
176045418,I feel the same way. Work is so exhausting for me that I rarely have the energy to do anything else afterwords. It’s emotionally draining too.
176045419,I am on a 1200 calorie diet and I find I am constipated since starting it. I go like once a week now and its uaually after I take milk of magnesia to help me. I find that since I am eating less I am going less. Do you have this problem? Or anyone else have this problem?
176045420,The article mentions that those who have positive voices are more likely to experience delusions of grandeur. It is interesting that you don’t match that. Sorry you mention earlier that you have no negative content and are thus more likely to experience delusions of grandeur as noted in the article.
176045421,I think it’s going to be a hot day here today. I might close the blinds to make it cool.
176045422,"I think I’ve aged pretty well and I guess sz is part of that as well as the genetics. Trouble is over here the sun is bad and I get way too much of it with my white, european skin.

176045427,"I don’t think I’ve ever complained about another guy being mean. Even when I got beat up or lost my childhood fights. That’s just the way it was growing up in my little world and my friends were the same way. But it dawned on me just last week that the neighbor upstairs is just a mean person. Can’t explain it. He and the other guy who passed away a couple of months ago were just trained to squash any sign or flicker of life, whether they are wrong or right or if it’s wrong or not. They just don’t care. I have to admit, it’s crushing my spirit. I earned what I know and but this is why I can’t win against these guys. Just venting because management says they can’t step in and these guys use these apartments as a personal playground to intimidate and have power."

176045460,There is no real reason why I should keep taking APs

176045472,I’m stuck at my parents too. They are afraid to let me move out due to my psychotic breaks. I’m dating and hopefully will have a serious enough relationship to live with someone else so they won’t have to worry as much
176045473,My hair started falling out as well-- wonder if that’s a thing amongst people who have experienced psychosis. I also have some serious under-eye bags that weren’t there before taking APs.
176045474,"I have degenerative arthritis in my whole body. My doctor didn’t recommend pills, shots, or surgery. He told me to “get out and walk”. So I did for a whole year and it didn’t help at all. So, I started doing yoga instead. Within 6 months, I was pain free."
176045475,"In the movie The Joker, _NAME_ says the worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to act as though you don’t have a mental illness. I think mastering this art is key to reentering society. Act normal, tell no one. I’m not quite there yet, but I’ve been improving over time so I still have hope. One day at a time is the only answer I can give. I already spent a year or so grieving what could have been once I got my insight back. I have this feeling of joy I get from not being in a solitary confinement cell. It’s been there in the back of my head cheering me on ever since I got out of the cell. See, once you’re deprived of everything other than food and a concrete slab to sleep on for half a year, you realize the rest of your life is actually a paradise by comparison."

176045482,"My therapist likes to talk about shame cycles. Basically, you got into a routine of being stuck in bed all day. You feel ashamed of it. The energy you spend being ashamed drains you so much you end up with even less energy to get out of bed. She would suggest that before breaking your routine, you need to shift your motivation. Instead of saying “I need to be stronger/less lazy/better” you could start by saying “I love myself enough to want to care for myself.” And even if all you do is tell yourself that, you’re still making progress. I know how our culture places high importance on material status. I know it’s hard to break out of the idea that you are worthless because you don’t produce capital. But you’ll probably have more energy to do things if you stop beating yourself up over what you can’t do yet."

176045489,I think that’s very reckless of him. None of my psychiatrists have told me to live on my own. My current psychiatrist knows that I wouldnt do well on my own but in the future I may get roommates to live with me. I may also end up living in a supportive living environment. I’m really too paranoid to live on my own.
176045490,"Please dont close my post because I need some reassurance and support. But, I want to ask can someone confirm that the tv was never talking about me and that nobody is watching me on camera? I really believe there is a camera implanted in my body and that the world is watching me. I’m afraid for my life because people will come after me if I’m being broadcasted on tv. I hear people talking about me everywhere I go. If this is a delusion, what will it take to break out of this delusion? This has been going on for 3 years. When will things get better? Will I be on tv forever?"

I never told anyone about these delusions not even this forum or my x boyfriend. Maybe it will come with time for you aswell.

I wanted to get out of the house so at 11:30 pm I straightened the house, filled a _NAME_-in-the Box cup up with ice and juice, put my coupon for CVS (drug store) in my pocket and took off. I got to CVS and I was buying something and at first I was the only one in line. Then some 19 or 20 year old kid came up to the line behind me and I was paying for soda and the guy was just standing too close. So I shot him a look and was paying for my stuff and I think he knew he was too close and he didn’t move. So I got really mad and I took a step towards him in his space and cut right in front of him. Then I realized the seriousness of the situation but I didn’t care. There were four of us standing there and I got my change and I said to him, “It’s your move man” and just looked at him.

174353465,"My father and grandfather have type 2 diabetes, but it is much less severe than negative symptoms."
176045567,"I used to, but CBT helped me learn to automatically push back and minimize them. Incredibly powerful tool, let’s me do a lot more on a lot less meds."

176045569,Did any of yours have visions of where they torture terrorists?
176045570,I hated school. I wagged a lot and wish I had of started wagging in primary school cause they treated me bad there. My favourite school was college. The teachers were best there. Unfortunately I wagged there too despite the teachers being great there. In primary school the teachers had disgusting unacceptable behaviour and were bullies and abusive. If I had children I would not let them go to a “normal school “. I don’t agree with what they teach. My child can tell the teacher they go to bathroom but not ask permission.you gotta go you gotta go.power crazed those teachers were. I never want to go to school again. In college I enjoyed it sometimes and even got top grades is some subjects. If I had the teachers I approve of I could possibly approve to learn something but maybe in a different way n environment and no fellow students. I don’t seem to go well with many people so to stop me from getting mistreated it may be best I don’t interact as such. I was bullied when I was in one neighbour
hood but that was outside of school. They were to busy wanting power over me in my younger days and they were jealous of me. They didn’t care or like me. I had no confidence back then. As young in Sweden I had no hopes and dreams.apathy even around the depression and hopeless. There are different types of schools nowadays. My mum wanted me to go to a Montessori school but she couldn’t afford it or my stepdad I had said no. I visited the school and it was vegetarian or vegan meals and a different type of learning where students are not spoken down at but treated with respect and as equals.

176045572,"Yes, absolutely it is so bad I can only close my eyes and lay in bed all day long like five days a week. I feel isolated. I feel sick and anxious. I see scary visions. I have to force myself to do anything. I feel weak."
176045573,Sorry I’d have to recheck I can’t remember what the official paperwork says and its in a heap I’d have to dig through. One of my plans for improving my life is getting a filing cabinet but I keep forgetting that its kind of a requirement.
176045574,"Man, I’m just hoping for 3,000 today. I’m off the antibiotics I’ve been on for the past ten days and my energy levels are coming back up again. Having the dental pain cut in half is also helping with the motivation. Want to be back up at 10,000/day by the end of July."
176045575,Is it something you can talk about? If someone can help you reason between when it is plausible and when it is not. It might help?
176045576,Which company is offering that? You sure its not a limited time promotion like first 3 months free?
176045577,Oh what was it for to please others? The internets full of ???????
176045578,I used to be exactly like that _AT_MENTION_
176045579,You’ll be fine. Take your meds.
176045580,Me and my family and the dogs are having our ashes scattered somewhere locally where we walk them. I am finding peace with that. That we will all be there together. If anything ever happened to my dog (and one day it will) I will look foward to being reunited with her again in the afterlife.
176045581,What do you think of these coincidences?
174353466,Oh yes I had that mindset once and I became the best damn volunteer workers in my local Library. (actually having schizophrenia significantly lowers the bar in most cases.)
176045582,It did not change my mood really. Or make me high. I used ones that were not high on THC. That is the part that makes you get that high feeling.
176045583,I feel like Drs just want to sedate and drug me to not feel emotions anymore.
176045584,My strabismus and bad depth perception contributes more to my bad driving ability than antipsychotics. Its hard to drive at night.
176045585,great approve for ssdi money.
176045586,Correction: *some years ago. I hate autocorrect lol
176045587,Happens sometimes to me.

176045589,"How many mg? 120mg caused me severe akathisia (restless), 80mg occasional akathisia preventing me from sleep. I just switched to risperdal."
174353469,I am much better at writing than talking. I often stutter and forget my points verbally. Not sure if it is due to schizophrenia or lack of practice.
176045590,"Well _AT_MENTION_ !, One Can Only Hope and Pray For The Best…, Perhaps, Expect The Worst and Pray For The Best…, But as Has Been Said Before, If One Expects The Worst, and Does Nothing Positively Fulfilling, For Themselves. Expecting The Worse Could Become a Self Fulfilling Prophecy…, So One May Want to Step Carefully & Capture The Sky (!!!)… . …"
176045591,Ha ha some people love to debate anything. My dad does it a lot but I’m pretty aware when he is trying to bait me into a heated debate .
176045592,I’ve cried daily for years. just lately i’ve noticed i don’t cry as often or frequently.
176045593,Did your doctor give you anything else to take during emergencies? Like something to calm you down ? Sorry you’re suffering so badly.
176045594,I have coffee in the morning usually but today I had a mixed fruit drink.
176045595,Maybe consider stopping the broccoli sprout extract. See if that turns things around.
176045596,"Oh, you mean like using cannabis? Ugh. There’s a new cannabis store in town on my usual walking route. I have to go around it because every time I look at it I want some of the wretched stuff."
174353463,Have you ever considered taking CBD _AT_MENTION_?
176045597,They help a little.
176045598,Good stuff ! Well done! I’m proud of myself when I do the dishes too.
176045599,"Let me start over. I’m under a lot of stress. Due to the psychosis. I don’t have a hypothesis that explains what I’m going through. Anything could be true at this point. I try to cling to my beliefs—science, secularism—but I don’t know how to reason about this phenomena. In ordinary life I don’t talk about it. I keep it vague if I do. I’d like to get to know some new people and have a place to come to for support. I may have made my account last year but I’ve only used it for 3 top posts. I hope you can accept my apology. I just don’t understand why harassment seems to be baked in to my life. I wasn’t talking about that agent guy specifically, but some people’s handles on here in general I do find triggering."
176045600,Yes some of the taxes go into health care
176045601,"I’m sorry. My dad made a bet with my sister that if she stopped sucking her thumb, he would quit smoking. She worked hard and stopped after like 6 months, and he kept smoking another 4 years until he died. He said he tried so hard to quit for her, but he just couldn’t. Maybe your wife is having the same issues? Has she tried the gum, or the patch?"
176045602,Fine … You’ll hear from me again …
176045603,"Yeah, I also have heard of it."
176045604,"aw thanks for the apology matey,it is all good"

176045608,"I feel ya. Sort of. I have zero sex drive and haven?t for years. But Mr _PERSON_ is really understanding about it, so it?s not really a big deal anymore."
176045609,"Wow, man. Can you set up some dehumidifiers in you room? Wish you all the best. I spent the whole summer in my granny’s house 3-4 yrs ago. My room was real dirty and humidity was real high.Luckily i had 70$ and I bought a dehumidifier. It helps a lot."
176045610,"digital piano, for the first time in a week, yesterday, for a whole hour. It felt good. I picked up right where I left off. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to catch up. I needn’t have worried. I’m going to be ready for my teacher five days from now."
176045611,I’ve been isolated Since I was a child I’m not sure I missed Out on much.
176045612,I wanna see you turn this around and find some happiness please stay with us
176045613,I might want to study finance and be a self-employed day trader or something or whatever it’s called.
176045614,"Not at the time, no. But it happens. This poll needs a ‘sometimes’ option"
176045615,I myself got scared enough of my psychosis returning that I checked myself in to be in a safe space with people who know about this stuff. Is this self-_USER_ID_ or is there maybe something about psychosis that is actually scary?
176045616,"As long as you feel you can stick to it, that’s all that matters. There’s a ton of apps out there that are really useful for keeping track of your nutritional intake-- MyFitnessPal is a pretty decent one. Some forum members have had success with counting calories. Sometimes we don’t realize just how much we consume in an entire day. And I would be remiss in not suggesting you consider seeing a dietician-- although many people have made great strides without consulting one first. Good luck!"
176045617,"I can’t really work nights, either, due to my AP causing drowsiness. But at my current job, I work till 7:30-8 PM every night, which is about as late as I can go."
176045618,I am on Latuda 80mg. At 120mg I have akathisia. You need to eat 350+ calories with it to work and it causes nausea or vomitting if you take it on an empty stomach. I am stable on it since a year ago.
176045619,What medicine and dosage are you on if you don’t mind me asking and what BMI are you at
176045620,"PubMed Childhood appendectomy and adult mental disorders: A population-based cohort... Childhood appendectomy, but not appendicitis without appendectomy, was associated with a significantly increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood."
176045621,I think it´s the right choice. My doctor used to prescribe me fluoxetine just because that reason so I believe is not that rare even if you don´t feel depressed.
174353472,"Meds are the reason I’ve enjoyed such a successful life as a schizophrenic. With medication I’ve been able to marry a wonderful woman, have a beautiful daughter, and work a succession of jobs that have paid the bills so I can live a decent enough life with hobbies I enjoy. Medication doesn’t do everything and I’ve had to carry some of that load myself, but life’s like that. No complaints (other than Zyprexa – ???? that med because it’s evil)."
174353470,"We talked about violence at work. My colleague doesnt dare pick up her post because it is in the same space where our homeless clients come. She doesnt want to meet them, even be in one room with them. Like, wtf, why do you work here, get out."
176045622,Yummy sounding! Thanks for giving me a clue lol
176045623,If I didn’t take an antipsychotic I wouldn’t even be able to cope with basic things. But eventually I’d drift into a waking dream world where I’d for instance think I could fly and jump off a building. So I’m just taking it to stay alive.
176045624,Doset not Disney lol
176045625,"I’ve lived past age 50 , I am alive and free, I have a half way decent life if I take it into correct perspective sort of. I suffer in silence ,fkn hate this fkn illness …people with cancer, redardaytion, ect… all get sympathy and love but not us! wtf … no saint status for us. Just life is what it is - fkn hate this fkn illness"
176045626,"Damn it _AT_MENTION_ , I told you not to say anything …"
176045627,"Low self esteem comes from being around people who don’t like people. No matter what you do, they’ll find a way to make you miserable about it."
176045628,"I used to have thoughts that i was the worst, most evil being. And indeed the weakest."
176045629,Thats good! I been having a weird day all day : /. I used to be on clozapine. How is it working for you??
176045630,I am taking 25 mg seroquel with 159mg ingeva it’s not taken all symptoms but 90percent
174353476,"Yeah, sometimes, it seems to me that God only proves himself (eg. to be real) to people who are special (unusual, weird, extraordinary, etc., maybe schizophrenic?). Sometimes, it can be scary, but in the end, don’t worry – he has a sense of humour about things. He got me to lose my iPod in an alternative reality, but after I came back to the ordinary world, I found it in a cabinet. Also remember that he has all the time in the world, so don’t be impatient."
176045631,"Why not, it was just a precaution"
174353480,"Depends on how he recovers and why symptoms are present. He might not be able to handle stress well anymore, I hope he can get back to it, once medicated. I hope he doesn’t end up with negative symptoms."
176045632,"I tried going cold turkey. After a day I was in psychosis and hallucinating that blood was running down my head. My pnurse told me that nicotine has antipsychotic properties and messes with the way my meds work, so when my brain was denied it all of a sudden it couldn’t keep up. She told me to never do cold turkey, but to take it down slowly instead. A good trick is to count how many cigarettes you smoke in a day, and then each day smoke one less until all you have left is your “good morning” cigarette, and then allow yourself that for a week before trying without it."
176045633,No. I believe the Universe is mind blowingly large but not infinite.
176045634,"Love this, Three."
176045635,Nice job. I wish I could do the same.
176045636,"No cases in my “state” yet, surprisingly."
176045637,"Yikes, y’all. I’ve relapsed. I ripped my left thumb in a state of derealization/psychosis, and I just realized that my thumb is heavily damaged. I can still play the harp, but it seems like I damaged my skin really badly. I also damaged my nail as well. Tomorrow is my harp lesson, and I don’t know how to explain my damaged thumb to my harp teacher. My harp teacher knows that I have an incurable condition, but I hope she doesn’t think I’m mentally ill. Would covering it up with a band-aid work?"
176045638,_AT_MENTION_ That does indeed make for not a great day. You going to make it through?
176045639,My brother has a lot of hatred towards me because I can show empathy for others. My brother lacks empathy so he is envious of what I’m capable of.
174353477,It did more when I was younger. My experiences of life were so different from everyone else’s i felt I could not connect to my peers. But as I got older and opened up about my illness to those closest to me I became much less lonely.
176045640,"Oh I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ , maybe next time."
176045641,"wash my clothes, workout and took a shower."
176045642,maybe you can listen some music? So you can drown out the whispering a bit
176045643,How is your monitor going?
176045644,Does that mean you arent on anti psychotics? And that being in those drugs were wrong?
176045645,Why did they cuff ya in the first place
176045646,I always thought that library was weird looking. It looks tiny in the outside but is probably big in the inside.
176045647,Yes I understand. 70% of the stuff I eat is relatively healthy but 30% of it is junk.
176045648,I’m glad the delusions I was experiencing in 2008 when I was unmedicated aren’t real.
176045649,"Yeah, it’s feast or famine with me. I’m either writing every day or not at all. I just take it as it comes. Life has taught me that, i suppose."
174353478,"When I withdraw from medication I feel good and on top of the world for about 3 years. I feel balanced out when withdrawing for some reason. The medications take a toll on your body and when I quit I get a release of endorphins and feel good. We all should be able to take out meds when we want to, not overdosing us and making us outta balance. Risperidone helps me more when I’ve stopped taking it. When I take it 24/7 I’m tired and lazy and sleepy. When I stop I get good feelings. I think things in moderation are better. Not overdosing us poor mentally ill people. I hope this helps. And thanks for learning about schizophrenia."
176045650,"I’m scared if I tell my pdoc she might panic and admit me or something… because of the word “kill”. But I don’t want to kill anyone, especially my husband. I have to tell her yes - and probably soon, but I hope it doesn’t mean another admission…I just was in there and got out in Jan."
176045651,"I mean, if they are hanging around for eternity…"
176045652,It’s pretty simple. Theres a button shaped like a bell at the bottom of topic that says “watching” Click that and you can do anything from mute to making it more important with notifications
176045653,Erm not good. I tried to appeal a hospilitisation but I had no capacity at the time… it was such a serious meeting and I burst out laughing… which was so inappropriate and I didn’t mean too
176045654,"2 pills of Omega 3 fish oil /day and high dose b-12 and other b vitamins will help with cognition. For me, omega 3 fish oil has improved my memory alot. It has improved benzo induced memory decline. I’ve yet to try b vitamins though."
176045655,I said “enough”. I cant stand it anymore.
176045656,Maybe you can sit every day for five mibutes and found some way to rationalize that fear. Take your time…
176045657,"King Prawn Curry, or Chefs chilli and mushroom Pazzi’s."
176045658,I take L-theanine supplements and I think they keep me calm. I used to take Ativan and Klonopin and they were calming.
176045659,This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
176045660,I was on it. I didn’t like how I felt on it either. I only took it for 2 months
174353483,Clozapine is more or less a last resort med
176045661,I don’t drink alcohol.
176045662,"Hah sorry. You’ll be fine on the meds, I haven’t gained any weight on risperidone but I dont overeat, sometimes I do but it takes a surplus of 3500 kcal to gain 1lb of fat in a day"
174353487,National Elf Service – 5 May 20 Psychological resilience to suicidal thoughts & behaviours in schizophrenia _NAME_ on psychological resilience to suicidal thoughts and behaviours in people with schizophrenia or psychosis. Unable to post much news as currently using stepdaughter’s laptop .
174353485,"_AT_MENTION_ yeah, you’re right. Does anyone have any feedback on this supplement?"
176045663,"No. It is the opposite. The idea of multiple alters scares me. I was just wondering if not to “want” to integrate is a rigid, fixed belief. Here your SZ May be more apparent. It is one thing if it is risky business to integrate, another if the person, in fact, appreciates the alters. Do you happen to have family outside of the alters? And, what do you think about them? What is best for them?"
174353489,It’s like it comes in waves. I can’t see rhyme nor reason to it. I’ve been on abilify solid for 6 years. It’s incredibly frustrating. It’s worse than frustrating because I was beginning to have transient suicidal thoughts. Don’t get me wrong I’m grateful the torture has finally ended. But it’s been there for about 2 long weeks. I feel a bit angry about it
176045664,well my dentist would say ‘Welcome to the circus’
176045665,Three times involuntary. The fourth time they told me if I didn’t sign a paper agreeing for 10 days of treatment they were going to have a judge commit me for 30. I spent over 12 hours in the ER that day. I wouldn’t sign the paper. Finally I signed it. That was the worst I have ever been.
174353488,"I think the beautiful thing about schizophrenia is that we learn to relinquish the traditional needs. A normie wants power, achievement and affiliation. Once we become sz all those expectations and desires dissipate. We are essentially living as enlightened beings. It’s a quiet and peaceful life for sure. Although enlightenment ebbs and flows. It’s not just a set state of being. In other words, it’s always gotta be worked towards. Those who seek shall find as somebody pretty famous once said. As somebody who -at least I think - has a self actualized personality I was never driven by power, achievement or affiliation. I’ve definitely never had a desire for power. The other two possibly. I think most people are driven by the need to take care of their family. Where does that fit into the three needs?"
176045666,Maybe try going outside just to be present in the outdoors for a bit. Yesterday I sat on my porch for like 20 minutes and it helped.
176045667,I have bad stress from a personal situation and the stress from the Coronavirus and it all kind of piled up on me today and I had thoughts of harming myself. I wanted to take a bottle of pills. Thankfully all my meds are locked up so I couldn’t act on it if I wanted to. I don’t think I would have. It was more just a quick reaction to the stress. It passed pretty quickly. I would say within about 30 minutes I had myself calmed back down. But it kept coming back up a little off and on. It really scared me because I’ve taken pills many times in the past and been in the ICU before because of it. I let my sister know so she would be on alert. I could use some love and hugs and support though.
176045668,"I have never worked . If I had worked one thing that would have adversely affected would have been using my initiative . If told to do x I would ,so long as it was within my range of abilities . The problem for me would be then working out what to do next , i.e using my initiative to follow through to the next task ."
176045669,"I had a scary dream, and woke up with my heart literally POUNDING. I could use some kind words, or a distraction from my nightmare."
176045670,Ya and I love it. Helps with mood and negs.
174353501,How long were you on it before voices subsided?
176045671,Delusions are harsh. The matrix was a movie. Only exists in Hollywood. Never seen _NAME_ show but from what I have read I used to have that too. Sometimes still do. I thought all the patients in my first hospitalization were actors. That trip made me delusional if I wasn’t already.
176045672,I’ve been smoking for at least 8 years and I still don’t have smoker’s cough.
176045673,"I no longer use any form of Social Media,Google or own a mobile phone, what the original poster said iam afraid to drop the BOMBSHELL IS TRUE!. and certainly not a delusion/thought.I would check I guy called _NAME_ and Facebook Execs they back this all up and it is indeed true!"
174353496,Is SzA as deadly a diagnosis as it sounds? Bipolar and schizophrenia together? A double dose?
176045674,"I usually eat well, except for my chocolate binges, which are usually a reaction to insults from the voices."
176045675,"I think this is my favourite of all your tracks _AT_MENTION_ . It just flows and sounds so well. Good stuff, dude !"
176045676,"That’s a bit extreme isn’t it, why would you think im that obsessed I simply am not.about 4 people would suffice."
176045677,"No, she was hit by a car hitchhiking to London she absconded from 2 years non compliant with meds in hospital She most likely was treatment resistant for 12 years of deteriorating psychosis"
176045678,"No, szs are not always psychotic. Thankfully I have large chunks of time where I’m normal."
176045679,Lose at least 40 lbs. Stay off the smoking. Maybe find a clinical trial that pays well.
176045680,A deep painful chest anxiety? I feel like I can barely breathe. My mind is going a million miles an hour and yet I feel frozen to my chair.
176045681,"This recipe is actually quote astounding. I love pickled eggs for their saltiness, and soy sauce has unique salty flavour to it. This might just be really good."
176045682,"I was so happy today I didnt get a warning letter, made a big mistake yesterday at work when I cold transfered someone basically transfering without introducing yourself to the person you transfering to"
176045683,This website gives back over and over again. Honestly. It’s about growing more than showing and as _AT_MENTION_ has outlined it’s about extremes more than the norm. I’ve had issues with such thoughts before having a decent relationship and it was nice to not be found wanting. Still. I’m just an average _NAME_ so it usually boils down to technique anyways.
176045684,I know bascs. Wanted to learn more.
176045685,Just need a spare doorway for that. Like a closet even.
176045686,I’ve taken lamotrigine for at least 15 years and never noticed anything. I never kept track of the days though. My periods were normal.
176045687,"Hello everyone, I consume risperdal, which seems to give me an intense appetite … I have gained a lot of weight and that worries me because I don’t want to have diabetes, but I always need to eat sweet things. On the other hand, I’m having millisecond hallucinations. Should I give vraylar a try? Is it better than risperdal? I am also concerned about social isolation, they say that vraylar does not give you that much appetite and improves interpersonal relationships."
176045688,That is beautiful. I can see the face.
176045689,"Wow, beautiful _AT_MENTION_!"
176045690,"I’m never alone and I already climb stairs to do laundry. I was already told that my own feelings are the best judge and, if I feel confident, to go for it. I assure you, I’m not going to be a fool."
176045691,Welcome to the forum.
176045692,that sounds sick I mean that is a voices cue to let you know about them. dam they must really be high on something.
176045693,It makes me feel better to know that I don’t deserve to exist it’s kind of like venting and hating myself at the same time it’s oddly comfortable
176045694,"I just cant wait vape omg, i need some nicotine lol hahaha"
176045695,"I tried contacts when I was in my early 20s but they would make my eyes really dry. The contacts sometimes spontaneously popped out of my eyes or would go up into the corners of my eye and I would have to get them back out. They were the gas permeable kind, soft contacts weren’t as common then. I have exclusively worn glasses since then. I like the way they look, so they don’t bother me."
176045696,I always drink two strong cups of coffee the first time I wakeup to prevent this from happening. If I don’t like last time I end up sleeping until 3pm and that really sucks.
176045697,Thanks _AT_MENTION_!
176045698,"My sz made me take bad judgements like trying suicide 3 times, voices/my sz told me to do it. Mental illness can make you do bad judgements."

174353494,"I found evidence on Facebook that something happened to me. This was years ago and it disappeared. I feel like something happened to me in college that was very, very traumatic. I don’t want to spread false information, get sued, get in trouble, or ruin anybody’s or the schools reputation. Maybe it was a parallel universe or in a different timeline. Am I a time traveler with a near infinite photographic memory? I might be the only one on the planet that can remember previous iterations of the ‘Matrix’ or my past lives with other people exactly like you guys in them. It’s apparently the same timeline or Earth. Is this the ‘_PERSON_ Effect’? I can tell when reality is being changed, altered, and edited constantly. I keep going back in time. I have dreams that are so real it’s crazy. It could be suppressed memories or even fantasies, which is hard to admit and accept. I have memories of being a clone and people being cloned. Perhaps, I had a visit from MiB or the ‘Adjustment Bureau
 which is a book and movie from _NAME_. Perhaps, most people I have had contact with had their minds wiped or were cloned. I don’t read science fiction at all – no way. But I love movies and TV Shows and YouTube Trailers. My former best friend (doesn’t talk to me anymore) said nobody remembers me at college. Like I didn’t exist or was never there at all. People have moved on and I was a very insignificant person at schools. I was a nobody and a ‘flunk’ out. I know nobody cares about me anymore. I rarely cared about them too, although I tend to obsess when I remember these people from my dreams. If even 1% of what I’m saying is true, then there should be some concern. I feel like I’m the perfect victim because I have schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia are often victimized and not believed. That’s my story and how I feel constantly. That I won’t ever get justice. I thought about getting help or going to the police, but they would just send me to the mental hospital. We all know how th
at goes. I’ve never found 1 person on this planet that ??????? believes me or really wants to help me anymore or entertains my thoughts, memories, and delusions. It’s probably a good thing sometimes or a bad thing depending on the situation. I don’t know why, how, or for what reason, but I’m constantly time traveling between dimensions and parallel universes and even backwards in time after I die from unknown reasons in the future and I get sent back in time constantly. I’ve even escaped reality or the universe and exited the ‘Matrix’ or ‘Brain in the Vat’ that we are living in. Perhaps, that is why there is no proof or evidence anymore. From my perspective, I was told I’m from 2036 and that the planet got nearly destroyed. Perhaps, I’m from another planet Earth…I’ve been told this before. In my past lives, I’ve met several famous people that I won’t mention. It sounds like _NAME_s Illuminati Whistleblower story, but it’s definitely not the same. I’ve never been in the clonin
g centers or “colosseum” but I have experienced horror and tragedy and being tortured in my past lives. It’s hard to separate the extreme fiction from the facts for me. So no wonder nobody takes me seriously or anything because I have some fantasy or delusions mixed in with what I believe is fact and real. I’ve been trying to get help and get heard and everything, but nobody seems to listen, care, or believe me or at least investigate my situation. Nobody believes in aliens yet. I even remember being horribly ‘insulted’ by a woman named _NAME_ on Facebook. This was back in 2011 and was a shock to my system. It was out of the blue and wrong. It really affected me and made me pissed off. It probably ruined my reputation. I rather not say the sickening thing she said. Maybe it wasn’t real in this life. Maybe it never happened at all. I don’t know. I’ve often felt blackmailed or extorted. I don’t know the definitions of these terms or the difference. I have a lot of missing time and memory and 
blackouts and blocked consciousness or recall. Like an amnesia barrier or dissociative amnesia or something. I don’t know. Maybe it never happened. Perhaps, I don’t remember. Perhaps, nobody remembers or has reveries like in “Westworld”. I felt like I was kidnapped out of my room. Maybe it was just aliens? Maybe it never happened. I felt like I even could have been sent to Mars for some time and went insane. My mind was uploaded to a real computer and I was cryogenic-ally frozen in a distant past life. So I achieved immortality. I have contradictory thoughts all the time. Like I was told I was a Super Soldier; that I was in the Montauk Project; That I was in Monarch; That I was in MK-Ultra; That I was in SSP; and that I was in MiLabs. And even the Illuminati and that I was a robot and/or an alien. I think that’s all I recall. I know I sound insane and I probably am and just don’t realize it as an outsider. Thank you. PS Perhaps, it’s time to become a writer of fiction and to move on --seriously 
this time. I’ve been told several times that I should be a writer or sci-fi writer. It’s the only thing I’m apparently good at anymore. I might love it too. Yes, I thought about getting money, but I rather be safe. Money is nice, but will never happen and is a form of selfishness and sin. Money would just cause problems for me. I realize we don’t live in a just world and a fair world. There’s nothing I can do but just sit in my room and try and recover. Maybe make some money off writing some short stories or books.

I don’t believe that there is a higher power steering us through life…if there was, then you could say that life is unfair, as this higher power would be responsible for giving us schizophrenia. However, i don’t believe that. Life is random, you could hit the jackpot or you could suffer. But one thing to remember is that, if you hit the jackpot, it didn’t happen to you because you’re an amazing person who deserve it. Just like getting schizophrenia, you didn’t get it because you’re an awful person and need to be punished. It was just a random luck of the draw.

When a good portion of time has passed, and you feel like you might be at an optimal level, talk to your doctor about slowly lowering your medication, if you want. Make sure they are informed the entire time and can look after you. If you lower your medication, be aware of side effects and have people keep an eye on you, that you trust for feed back.

Wordpress is a good platform that is active still. If you want more structure in your writing, read some books on writing. It’s as simple as Thesis, Point 1, Point 2, Point 3, Conclusion. That makes a structured paper. I loved what you said your dad said about flitting from topic to topic. I too am a _NAME_ of all trades, master of none.

176045764,"Probably 1990 to 1995. I was living in a board & care home but I was only unemployed for a month while I stayed there. I worked at Sears, mainly unloading trucks, driving a forklift and putting merchandise in customers cars. We had an eight man crew of mostly teens and guys in their twenties but I was like one of the top two workers and I was in my mid thirties. I did everything at breakneck speed. I was also attending community college two days a week. I caught the bus for an hour and a half to get to work and then an hour and a half back. School was a 40 minute bus ride. After school I had a favorite restaurant I would stop and eat at right across the street. On my way back from work I used to stop downtown at Woolworths and eat at their lunch counter. If I didn’t stop at Woolworths, there was a Chinese restaurant a little closer to home that I often ate at. I had just gotten clean and sober when I moved into the group home and I was walking or catching the bus to 5 or 6 AA, CA or NA meetings a 
week. My mom happened to live near Sears and a lot of times after a hard day at work I would walk over to her and my step dads house and do a couple hours of yard work and then stay for dinner. My step dad would give me a ride home or I would catch a bus home. I caught the bus a lot back then. I lived in a large city and traffic was terrible and when I caught buses there was usually standing room only. I usually rode the bus every day. Sometimes three times a day. I made one friend at the board & care home and he started coming to meetings with me. We would go to AA functions like dances or picnics or holiday meals. I usually had weekends off and me and my friend would catch the bus to the movie theaters or Tower records and other places. If I don’t hang out with him on weekends I would catch the bus to my sister’s and her husband’s house. They found a bar/restaurant that had a sand volleyball court in the back and for quite awhile we would go there with my sisters and her husband’s friends and play v
olleyball for a couple hours with whatever strangers at the bar wanted to play with us. Those were my productive years. I just did so much crap. I went to several concerts while at the home. I saw Pink _NAME_ once and U2 and Aerosmithand a couple others. _NAME_ _NAME_ My brother in law at the time was running a startup company and this was during the 1990’s technology boom when there were millionaire’s being made every week. He hired me to work at his business and paid me under the table. But that’s how much he liked my work. Me and my friend used to go places. The library was a 15 minute walk away and we would go and check out tape cassettes. And I went to my therapist weekly, they were about a 15 minute walk away too. The city was predominantly Hispanic and we used to walk to the Mexican restaurant at the end of our street and get Horchata drinks or sometmes a burrito. They treated us funny there, we never knew where we stood with the workers there. They seemed kind of friendly but tended to come acro
ss as a little hostile since we were usually the only white people there. I did all kinds of miscellaneous stuff. Went and saw a talk by _PERSON_. We went there expecting a concert at this church but all he did was talk for an hour about his religion. Me and my friend went to a prayer meeting at this woman’s house that I worked with. It was a bizarrely funny experience but I won’t tell the story. IDK. I just really got around a lot back then. I was healthy and in good shape and just really active. Probably never be that productive again."

Even if they are talking about you - just try to ignore them. Maybe they are just bloody nosey like mine are.

When I had my psychotic break I believed some stuff that I never before thought I could ever believe. Now every once and awhile a thought will pop into my head, and I’m afraid of it. I was doing the crossword earlier, where different names for satan was the theme. Then I just had this thought of, what if the devil is real, wouldn’t that be pretty scary, huh. Then I tried to imagine it and actually started to feel a little scared. Anyway, I hope it really is a random thought that won’t come around again."
176045772,"in middle school I was an outsider, but I had two best friends and a lot of people liked me and I them. In 8th grade a former friend bullied me. I felt shunned towards the end of 8th grade. In 9th grade after two months hanging with the popular guys I took a nosedive and starting isolating at lunch. Two guys in my Spanish class from that group asked me why I wasn’t with them at lunch. Which proved that certain people wanted me. But of my own free will I rejected everyone and 8 years later here I am in ruin because of those decisions. And by now my self hatred has made me a stranger to the lovable kid I once was. I can’t feel any good emotions, can’t really laugh without pain, can’t enjoy simple pleasures. No friends. Still no gf at 22. On top of that I’m in Missouri and things are still strange to me here. I miss my small town but even when I went there in 2017 i was sick and felt nothing. I drive Uber and have some positive interactions but i never see my passengers again. I truly am a n

176045774,"I have the same delusion. It doesn’t seem to be a coping mechanism. I am a hardcore introvert who hates excessive attention, yet it still happened to me. Something real seems to be going on, metaphysically. Regardless of whether you think it’s real or not, good treatment shuts the phenomenon off."
176045775,My psychiatrist temporarily raised my risperidone dose when my Mom was dying in Hospice. I’m back to my regular dose now. My Mom passed away in September. God Bless her.
174353521,"Of course it improved, I was insane and suicidal."
174353515,"Well I said people might believe you are a psychopath from the lying and manipulation. You also threatened to kill your doctor. Threatening someone’s life who is trying to help you simply isn’t right and you clearly don’t take a person’s life very seriously by saying that. However, I do think you might simply be attention seeking at this stage. I believe you have factitious disorder instead of psychopathy because I am believing you are actually 15 and a girl. You have a lot of knowledge of schizophrenia and psychosis. You said you have delusions and hallucinations and see demons out of no where. Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason. You are treated with several anti-psychotics but nothing helps. You are always in the psychiatric hospital in your country. You argue with doctors about your symptoms and even threatened to kill him."
176045776,I take 6 mg of Melatonin. Works great for me.

174353532,"When you look at the person (sample) You think that,there are sensory stimuli inputs, feelings and higher mental processes to producing the personal behavioral responses outputs which you diagnosis them as a symptoms of sz When you say the term “psychosis” you meant the feelings and the higher mental processes which precede the behavior responses and cause them So,using the term “psychosis” is similar to using term ""mental "" , Psychosis =the thoughts / feelings in isolation about the personal behavioral responses outputs Psychosis is the sums of feelings + mental processes that happen Before the production of the behavioral responses regard with your observations / perceptions,the personal executive behavioral responses outputs are the symptoms of the schizophrenia The questions; What did you meant by the word ""psychosis ""? What did you meant by the statement "" the person who experience early psychosis "" ? What did you meant by the statement "" symptoms in individual with early psycho
sis "" ? What is the early phases of psychosis in the first place ?"
176045779,Maybe because Lorazepam is losing it’s effectiveness. Some people here say they’ve been on benzos for years and that they haven’t lost effectiveness. But the offical story is that they’re for short term use only as they lose effectiveness. That applies to all benzos.
174353525,If theyre not improving on the it own you may need to be proactive. If they bother you that much you should really consult a professional like a social worker who can help you get this straightened around.

176045783,I’m very socially awquard. Possibly aspergers. My social level is probably a 3. I only socialise with family. The most social thing I do is go to games workshop for events. And painting there. Fortunately being the hobby it is…most people who are there are also socially awquard so I just fit right in.

176045785,You get to use your phone in the ward? That must be nice.
176045786,I think this will be my next and final stop after where I’m at now. Sometimes I wish I was 15 years older so I’d fit in better with the retirees in FL. Sounds rediculous to to want to throw away 15 good years down the drain to get old I know…
176045787,I’m not taking it. It interacts with abilify.
174353524,"Ever since latuda and perphenazine, nope. But zyprexa and clozapine, definitely!"
176045788,"From my experience, I had to go back on my meds and stop allowing myself to think about the things that other people didn’t believe. It was and still is frustrating. I had to let it go, though. Sorry if I’m not making sense, not much sleep lately"
174353527,"There is also a symptom that I would like to learn more about. When a person starts coughing, gurling or choking and making especially gross sounds. In my case it happens very rarely, when I think of shameful past experiences. With schizophrenia there are plenty of regretful memories. It more often takes form of pitiful moaning than gurling. On the other hand, my mother has coughing fits every morning and every night. She coughs and gurgles as if choking on her tongue or vomiting out her entrails. That continued for years. If it was some physical illness, I expect something that severe to have already killed her. Obviously as a mental patient she refuses to contact a doctor about it either. So, in the light that I encountered similar symptoms to her, just much less severe, I suspect it is rather mental problem. Difficulty breathing is known among schizophreniacs. Does this notion explain the issues mentioned previously?"
174353528,I’d say my schizoaffective is mild to very mild. Minor positive symptoms . Slightly less minor negative symptoms . Cognitive symptoms: Good in parts.but bad in others. Hard to separate how much is ASD related and how much sz-a related. How I am on the forum is a poor indicator of how well I do off it
176045789,I still had paranoia on 80-120mg Latuda. Had bad akathisia that prevented me from sleeping. Nausea and sometimes I vomitted the pill.
176045790,The psychiatrist believes somewhat at least that I have delusions. We’re upping my haldol dose. I feel a little bit better. Even though I explained to her that if I was a terrorist that would put me in the minority of the population and how can she know for sure? That’s what I’m struggling with.
176045791,_NAME_ you have been sounding unwell for a while now. What is your med situation?
176045792,A few people have shunned me because of my diagnosis but they were never worth having in my life anyway. Good riddance.
176045793,"I still experience God talking to me. I’m still paranoid of my gf. And she’s paranoid of me too. I suspect that she doesn’t love me, and she suspects that I look down on her and consider her “beneath” me. (Which is a load of bull). I also believe that my niece has ulterior motives for being so kind and sweet to me. I suffer from a lot of negatives too."

176045798,You need to call your doctor ASAP. These hallucinations could be being exacerbated by the topamax.
176045799,"You are welcome I once suffered from anxiety. My Pdoc treated it with huge amounts of benzoes in high dose. I ended up at psych ward / rehab and was tormented by anxiety and abstinences, but once i got rid of the benzoes i learned step by step and with the help of mindfulness how to deal with the anxiety and now i have almost no anxiety."
176045800,Holy guacamole ! Congratulations !
174353536,"I’ve lost count of my hospitalizations. My longest one was 3 months, my typical ones just a few days. My last hospitalization was in May for 2 weeks…they were going to send me to the state hospital in Anchorage but the waiting list wasn’t moving and since I was no longer a danger to myself they let me go home. Years ago it was much more common for a typical stay to last up to a month but changes to insurance compensation led to the push for shorter stays. I was also on olanzapine and gained 30lbs in 2 months. I quit taking it because I hated myself for getting fat again and, worse, for feeling like I had no control over my eating. I’m on Abilify now and it handled most of my symptoms but now I only get about 3-4 hours of sleep each night…so every 5 or 6 days I “supplement” it with some old thorazine I have and am able to get 6 hours sleep."

Some improvement was from maturity and some from following directions and consistent study habits. I take my meds a lot. I do better on second generation ones. Risperdal and paroxetine. I have my problems since I am older, but good enough. I think about dementia a bit, but I guess I’ll deal with that when it starts to happen, if it does. My parents had a strong constitution and mine is pretty strong. Live healthily."
174353538,"In terms of the schizoaffective- minor, breakthrough,positive symptoms . As for negative symptoms that’s more difficult to say re separating what’s due to the sz-a or to the ASD. I would say social functioning is very important, and for me a problem area… How much ASD or the sz-a negatively impacts on that I wouldn’t like to say."

My hubby would have, but if he leaves the state, he is required to go on a 2 week quarantine by his job, and we can’t have that. So her friend was kind enough to do it. Anyhow, he’s coming in the house, which makes me nervous because, well, people, and also because coronavirus. So that’s what’s going on with me today. On another note, I want _PERSON_."

176045825,"Theres never simple answers to good questions most of the time and when it involves things like resentment or similar things and the effect these emotions have on us In many levels is a doozy often. I know that resentment doesn’t necessarily mean hatred as in the same level of emotion etc. But I always say that hatred always betrays the hater and I think the same can be said about resentment. Reason Why it betrays is from my experience and personal opinion is. 1-We have a sense of being right and or self righteousness and deserve to feel this way. In allot of ways we do have the need or even right to feel like … well we’re right … we / I was wronged. No doubting this can be legit . Altho it’s healthier to not hold in the sense of right whether we’re right or wrong due to the fact it will toxifi our self in many ways from mental health, how we view the world , our physical health and other ways that I’m sure you already get. The better choice for our/ your health is to either work it o
ut by talking to whom you resent and find a level of peace thru communication. Another is simply / unsimply let it go if for no other reason than your happiness and over all health. Another thing I always say is give the grace to others that you hope to get. Let’s face it none of us are perfect. This doesn’t mean we have to be ok with being mistreated of course nor should we keep being vulnerable in the ways someone brought on this need to feel like resentment. In reality over all we only have so many options to be ok in a realistic way. I know this isn’t the perfect answer but I hope it helps as it has helped me countless times. Becoming indifferent and or forgetting someone in a sense is a better extreme than brooding etc for your overall health. Wishing you the best!"

If I run out and they don’t have zinc in stock by then I think I’ll have to temporarily substitute with ZMA (zinc magnesium aspartate). I just don’t like this supplement because it gives you vivid dreams that can feel very real and also very scary if it’s a stress dream or nightmare.
174353551,Try switching to amisulpride or risperidone as they help with your positive symptoms more than other aps before switching to clozapine if they don’t work
174353547,"Yeah im guessing my pdoc said it was ok because i dont have any side effects from abilify, so he must’ve assumed it was low risk. So far so good. If you get side effects from abilify i would guess rexulti would make it worse. Rexulti came out when abilifys patent ran out (or something), allowing generic versions to be made. So my guess is its fairly similar to abilify, but apparently its more like risperidone."

176045870,You thinking about it?
176045871,Why do I even matter to you?
176045872,Well as a combat helicopter pilot I used to get shot at but then I almost killed myself several times when I wasn’t being shot at so it was definitely dangerous. But I am afraid of heights. I can fly but working on a skyscraper or something like that is definitely out for me. I couldn’t do it. No matter what the pay.
176045873,"I’m not sure if this is helpful, but I have read about MUSIC being used as a form of mind control and more crazily, and unknown in facilitating or actually causing TIME TRAVEL, which is cool. I have a book on the Montauk Project called “Music of Time” by _NAME_. He was allegedly an engineer on the project (deceased now) with an IQ over 200. He used music and stuff to program and deprogram people among other methods. Not really a fan, but I love and collected all the books. Personally, I think I was in the project myself. No evidence of course. It’s an evil project. I was probably a victim of the boys program where I time traveled and stuff among other things. I believe it’s definitely real and not a conspiracy. They even talk about the Matrix briefly but they don’t know much about it or I didn’t believe everything I heard perhaps. They say people who gravitate towards these things were most likely involved because most people are turned off or are not interested, get mad, or just hate 
it and don’t believe it at all. I mean I was driving today and was thinking about aliens again and how a lot of people are under some form of mind control in not accepting or believing we have intelligent life out there in the universe and somehow they never visited us…to me it seems stupid. Some people even say (MUSK) that since we haven’t found life, it probably shows us we are living in the Matrix because “where are all the aliens again?” Occams razor and that alien equation (forgot the name…). So yes, I don’t know a lot about art, but I believe some forms of expression are definitely related. Think of cave paintings, indigenous tribes and their art work of pictures of aliens and abstract symbols and stuff… There symbols are complicated and even are severely advanced and secretly studied. It’s all over the world too. There’s so much out there in regards to symbols in crop circles, pyramids, and stuff there’s no way I can cover it all here. Good luck. Hope this helps."

174353549,"I had bad anxiety and bouts of depression but I didn’t constantly grapple with the question of what will be the next thing to cause me to lose my grip on reality. I was working full-time at a department store. I was popular with my coworkers. I prided myself on my work ethic. All things I couldn’t replicate at my first job post-psychosis (and my last job to date). If I had to list some downsides to what my life was like pre-sz, I was really struggling with an eating disorder that dictated I only eat about 1,000 calories a day. I was wasting away and perfectly fine with it because I just didn’t care about myself anymore. I was callous towards people who dared express the darker sides of themselves.

174353558,We don’t need a cause. Also they do know a cause for type I diabetes. Does it help anybody? We need a drug for cognitive/negative symptoms. MIN-101 is good candidate but for negatives only. Maybe we need a little bit better antipsychotics. Vraylar and Abilify are not bad. But Lumateperone (if approved) will be better. Still place is vacant for a normal cognitive drug. Then I’d suggest them to ???? off and let us live.

176045928,"Make sure you have enough fatty acids in your diet. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Essential fatty acids and human brain. _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neurologica Taiwanica , Dec 2009 The human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. We've learned in recent years that fatty acids are among the most crucial molecules that determine your brain's integrity and ability to perform. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are required for maintenance of optimal health but they can not synthesized by the body and must be obtained from dietary sources. Clinical observation studies has related imbalance dietary intake of fatty acids to impaired brain performance and diseases. Most of the brain growth is completed by 5-6 years of age. The EFAs, particularly the omega-3 fatty acids, are important for brain development during both the fetal and postnatal period. Dietary decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is needed for the optimum functional maturation of the retina and visual cortex, with visual acuity and mental development seemingly improv
ed by extra DHA. Beyond their important role in building the brain structure, EFAs, as messengers, are involved in the synthesis and functions of brain neurotransmitters, and in the molecules of the immune system. Neuronal membranes contain phospholipid pools that are the reservoirs for the synthesis of specific lipid messengers on neuronal stimulation or injury. These messengers in turn participate in signaling cascades that can either promote neuronal injury or neuroprotection. The goal of this review is to give a new understanding of how EFAs determine our brain's integrity and performance, and to recall the neuropsychiatric disorders that may be influenced by them. As we further unlock the mystery of how fatty acids affect the brain and better understand the brain's critical dependence on specific EFAs, correct intake of the appropriate diet or supplements becomes one of the tasks we undertake in pursuit of optimal wellness."

So I learned you need the molecular weight of the compound. so the molecular weight of sulforaphane is - 177.29 daltons. im not to sure what a _NAME_ is but must be a measurement. Then I read your suppose to divide the _NAME_ measurement by the amount of micromoles. so 177.29 / 100 = 1.7729 mg so thats 1773 micro grams Science people please let me know if thats right _AT_MENTION_ did I convert it right? sincerely sir scientific de level"

174353578,"I only posted this as I’m about to research more,of course,if you want. This is the first hypothesis that I posted about role of cytokines as immune cells in schizophrenia. I tend to research this area because I found correlation between schizophrenia as autoimmune disease,which is for now unproved hypothesis in humans,but tends to be promising. Of course,this is one of theory,but also I believe there are different factors in developing schizophrenia,as for example genetic predisposition in people who’s parents had or have MI,and also where schizophrenia is developed by use of certain psychotropic substance. That has nothing to do with this findings. Also,if this hypothesis is proven,there will be new agents that differ in structure of novel antipsychotics. There are articles I found that measure amount and type of cytokines in each antipsychotic. For example,cytokines tend to be present in larger amount in risperidone treatment,while insignificant in aripiprazole therapy. For further research

The agent provides a better balance of receptor activity that may allow for therapeutic doses to be used in difficult to treat patients while limiting the impact of the common neurological, metabolic and endocrine side effects associated with commonly prescribed agents."

174353586,"have been on risperidone for 5 months and I can barely get out of bed. I just want to sleep all day and not do anything. I found this was true for a few months after psychosis even when I was on Fluonxol and risperidone didnt make a difference. Everyone is different and I dont find risperidone sedating. Also, I get akathisia so it’s a never-ending cycle of getting up and pacing around and going back to bed. I had this on fluonxol but not on risperidone its rarer with second generation antipsychotics I’ve also lost interest in most things and have a lack of motivation. I don’t experience the ups and downs like I used to and feel like I have little emotion. I did feel flat expecially on 5mg slowly went down to 3mg and feel less so now, so it does make you a bit flat but after psychosis you get the same effect for a few months. I started a new job recently but had to take leave because I just couldn’t get any satisfaction from my job and made me exhausted and tired. My sex drive is basically g
one. Same here but it gets better with lower doses, might move to abilify in six months because of it. I’m not sure if I’m depressed or it’s because of the risperidone. Anyone else has similar experiences?"
176045986,I used to talk to them. But not anymore. Not since I started APs. That went away. Being followed by the men didn’t. They still follow me and assign people to follow me
176045987,"Yesterday I was harmed in my bones badly. It was invisible and no one could see it or hear it, it felt as stabbing or twisting in my bones and my kneecap felt as though it were twisted off also. When my conscious non human experiences began in _NAME_ az. when I was seventeen I could not have known what to make of it whatsoever, one man recently suggested the grey whom tortured me was only young, could have been the case. I have found him you know. I have begun my path to going to meet him. I found him, this is unheard of now but I found him in a very real way. The first universe was alive and I ??????? found him. I want to go meet him badly but this place and my bodily web is holding me back. I’m going to go meet him face to face after my death. He is the only one with no beginning out of all universes and i’m going to ??????? go meet him. And so can you. Any of you. I cannot wait to die, I desperately want to die but they force me to survive on this wretched earth. Yeah, meet him if you want y
ou goddamn fools go meet him to, see if he can help you all at some goddamn point you goddamn fools. I imagine the first universe is also quite clean as well, that alone makes it worth the trip. Probably smells great those pure energy perfect universes. Almost home free. Death of my body and my consciousness saved, on to better things. I also am to be raised to his equivalence with his help and guidance, all you have to do is ask him. I am sorry to those who are going to have to keep surviving, my heart goes out to you who will make it to sixty years old or more, deepest apologies to survivors really. Never was crazy, i’ll show you sometime."

176045999,"Things can get better but it’s up to you. It won’t come from the outside. Happiness won’t come knocking on your door, you have to plant a seed of optimism in your heart and let it grow. Like for example you assume nobody wants anything to do with you because you have a mental illness. Not true. But you got to treat friendship like a need to know basis thing. When I meet new people I never tell them about my disease unless it serves a purpose. And people I have got to know well haven’t left me when I revealed my issue. There is a old saying that says “the pessimist might be right in the end, but the optimist has a much better journey along the way.”"

One support worker insisted i meet him in town twice a week in a coffee shop. Which just made me anxious when the time was due - cos some days i simply cant go out the flat due to being paranoid. Its gotta be on my terms, I know his logic - he was trying to get me to confront my emotions - but i gotta prepare for stuff like that - and sometimes i havent got it in me."

Second question : you on english-speakers forum are discussing a lot about sarcosine and other supplements. What are the risks and the good things that can happen to me if I take sarcosine or other kind of supplements ? I’m afraid to fall into manic or to get physical illness. I mean, I really appreciate my “mental stability” but I would like to feel less negative symptoms… I would like to be a more creative person again. Thank you…"
176046013,Yeah - Sorry but i would. You need something like procyclidine for that shite.

174353593,"Well, when I was on 5mg Abilify, hallucinating and paranoid, I wasn’t answering my therapist’s calls. When I finally answered, I was pretty nasty to her. I finally agreed to see the psychiatrist. When she called this week, I had been out running errands. I was sitting in my chair in the living room, and my phone was plugged in, in the bedroom. I got her message, and she said to call her, so I did at 6pm. She’s just wary of me right now because of the way I behaved on 5mg."

In the seventies and forward, new tactics for resuscitation emerged, which kicked off the commonality of reports of such experiences.

A person on the reddit schizophrenia forum, “NotSoGenericUser”, made a post ( here ) about how he had tardive dyskenisia and came across that study, which lead to him trying a chelation therapy to remove the excess iron from his brain, which lead to a resolution of the tardive dyskenisia.

I might be allergic or something. Anyways, I notice when I dream or wake up in the middle of the night when weak and suggestible, I notice what you’re saying; that psychosis is an alternate reality. I think my caffeine dependence is causing me to obsess, remember, and not get over the trauma and move on. Like I can access parallel universes and remember ???? because of the drinks. It’s like I designed them that way so I can remember. It sucks. I rather just quit them. Like even if I was in Mk-Ultra (for simplicity), and yes I was to some extent, it shouldn’t matter. The stronger I am, the more able I’m able to move forward. There are veterans out there that survive and have PTSD and are truly disabled and somehow have moved on and functioned. Even _NAME_ became a senator and moved on. I need to not look back. Ev

Like I was thinking of Many Worlds Theory and consciousness traps (or trapping one’s consciousness/soul) preventing one from escaping to another life or universe as in reincarnation or MWT. I seem to be suffering from this. I need to move on from the victim mentality, which is just worsened by the energy drinks. I have a hard time remembering past lives and extreme trauma. I must move on. The longer I am stuck here at this place, the longer I’ll take to recover – if ever."

If you want to discuss your new hobbies, that goes under creativity. If you want to share pictures of things you made, or pictures you took, or videos/songs you made, that goes under creativity. If, on the other hand, you are sharing a neat video you found online, that goes under the lounge. If you want to discuss a painting by another artist that you like, that goes under the lounge. Famous songs, photographs, and videos are all under the lounge. The only things that go under “creativity” are things you create yourself. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer moderator"

That really is a hard cop and there’s always someone online who doesn’t see eye to eye. I’m just glad I found him and don’t let him go.

But, which genes and why some of us become schizophrenic have never been researched thoroughly.

176046241,"I don’t know if it alleviates psychotic symptoms but since I was on a keto diet for 23days, my sleep amount significantly decreased. I sleep for 5hours now only but feel not too much tired. And lost weight too for a short period of time. But after the diet, I will increase consumption of carbs to moderate amount because keto does not perfectly fit for a woman."

I ate a good breakfast, read almost 40 pages in a book, took a shower (cant remember the last time I took a shower every other day, and I also got to draw, watched tv, had friendly conversations. Its like when my brain wakes up, something (voices) have to sabatoge it for me"

176046256,"You lost that weight over the better part of a year, so that is not too bad. You don’t talk about your diet makeup. Are you getting enough protein? That should help with the loss of muscle. Are you feeling weaker? If you’re not, then I wouldn’t worry too much, but maybe you should ease up on your diet. I know that can be hard, because once you ease off the brakes your calorie intake can develop a life of its own. I used to lose weight for wrestling, but that was a different approach than yours."
176046257,"I dont reckon they would ever force me to take mine - and i have refused the jab before, but always given in, when ive realised im being an idiot and actually need them. They do hound me daily tho - in a nice way if im ever late. But im also fiercely defensive of my ability of having mental capacity (and i tell them!) The first thing to crop up is anxiety when im without - and that always feeds one of my long standing delusions. My EUPD traits come thru as well - and my mood starts changing on an hourly basis."
174353651,"APs can cause _NAME_ too, especially at higher doses. Vraylar causes some (I’m at 9mg lol) but it’s not as bad as abilify or risperdal. When I went on Caplyta, I was doing much better _NAME_ wise."

176046283,I just got back into running. Hope you enjoy it. I think it feels really good to get the heart going. I go for a six mile run now quite often. I like to run for a while to some good music and then walk a little and then start running again when I feel like it and keep alternating. Maybe the muscles will get stronger and I will start walking less.

176046287,"Without medications I had all kinds of delusions. I’ve never had auditory or visual hallucinations but , for example I use to believe someone had inserted a microchip in my head and people could read my thoughts. Thats just one of many delusions I had while unmedicated."

176046295,Yeah. And they send others too. I was going to do a class I’ve always wanted to do but don’t want the men watching me do it. It’s a personal thing because it’s religious. It’s none of their business.
176046296,"I googled years ago the Matrix delusion and insanity defense and they go hand in hand. I’m really sick but I’m getting better and made strides about a billion percent. I used to be practically worse than blind and severely dissociated. Life has been extremely tough for me and I don’t know why. I am confident but it’s never been confirmed that I was a Montauk Boy. From what I’ve researched 1% of them survive. Of those 1%, 1% remember what happened to them and a further 1% of those people can function and live on their own. So I guess I’m a rarity but I can’t make money or do much with my life. I hope I can stay on social security for a while. I am getting better but it’s going to take a few years and some motivation and motivating factors to get over these humps. I hope I can be one of those 1 in 1 million Montauk Boys that can make it and have money and an education and perhaps a family some day and not be stressed out and paranoid all the time."
176046297,"_AT_MENTION_, You obviously need your meds. I recommend you stay on your meds. We’ve all been on the merry go round of going off meds and ending up back in the hospital then going back on meds. Why do you want to mess with your brain and your life like that by going off your meds?"
176046298,My family has been there for me through some pretty rough times and I want them to know I appreciate them. What are some things I can do to show my appreciation? How do you show your family that you appreciate them?

176046308,Thinking of you. Everything is going to be ok! Sincerely hoping that the surgery will go well.

174353688,"good going man, i dont think i could have done that, well done"
176046315,Welcome to the site _AT_MENTION_. High doses of various meds didn’t work for me at first for a few years and I was considered treatment resistant. I eventually discovered CBT and that really helped me push back against my positive symptoms and move to lower doses of newer medications. I strongly recommend either getting signed up for CBT or finding resources and attempting to do it on your own if you must (that’s the route I had to go because of limited resources and access to professionals).
176046316,Low dopamine levels are associated with increasing appetite. They are blocking your dopamine which has a similar affect. I am not convinced that they slow metabolism. They just make you consume too many calories.

176046322,coffee is important.

176046325,I never felt more stupid than when I noticed I was becoming aggressive.
176046326,"If marijuana caused schizophrenia everyone would have schizophrenia. There would be a massive increase in the number of people with schizophrenia at the very least, especially with legalization in many countries and states in the US. But there isn’t. It’s still the same amount of people. There has to be a genetic pre-disposition to develop schizophrenia for it to occur. This is a fact and recent science. Does smoking weed for those with a pre-disposition to develop schizophrenia play a role? Certainly yes, but it in and of itself does not directly cause schizophrenia."

176046329,Can I be honest? I’m feeling suicidal.
176046330,Stress makes me have positive symptoms even on meds but they are controllable on meds.
176046331,"Why not ? Couldnt hurt. Always good to have some in case of emergencies, imo."
176046332,"Why would you friend care if you kissed a guy? Sounds like they’re being real unsupportive. As for the guy, it’s totally reasonable to want more than FWB. He was using you and mistreating you and shouldn’t be surprised you didn’t like it. You won’t go to hell for refusing to have casual sex. You won’t go to hell for choosing to have casual sex. It has no bearing on anything."
176046333,I feel pretty good. I have too much time on my hands. I get stressed easily and overwhelmed but if I take an easy job like cashiering maybe I can do it. The only problem is I can’t afford to go back to work part-time. I would have to go back full-time. Part-time would knock me off Medi-Cal and I wouldn’t be able to afford my medicine so I would have to go full-time in order to get medical insurance to pay for my meds. A brand new casino just opened up in town. They are hiring tons of people and they offer benefits. I have 5 years experience in cage cashiering and can easily get a gaming license. I really feel like I should do it. I’m going to have to buy a cheap car though to get back and forth to work because my hours won’t line up with my sister’s hours so I can’t use her car. It’s a lot to think about but I really think I’m ready. What do you think?
176046334,Talking about the past is needed in therapy. You can change therapist if you want to…
176046335,"I’m not sure if you are just angry or you haven’t suffered real actual torture. I have, and I wouldn’t wish it even on those aliens who supposedly caused it to me. Nobody deserves to be in hell, it is a place that is so wrong it shouldn’t exist. Imagine someone burning you forever, and you never die. If somebody has done something wrong, further wrong must be prevented in humane means, and not as a punishment done based on emotion, but as a prevention."
176046336,"Good for you and good for your daughter _AT_MENTION_ . You are a good, supportive presence on these forums and I think many people appreciate it. Good luck on your next party too!!!"

174353682,Its causing me such bad cognitive disfunction. My last shot was February 3rd. I feel like my IQ has plummeted
176046344,i live in a small town in the north of belgium near the dutch border. it’s good place to live i think… not too many people out so when i go for a walk with mobile team girl i hardly run into any people at all.
176046345,I said hi to my mailman recently and got no response. I thought that was very rude of him. I was clear to him so I know he heard me. I have a feeling he senses that I’m mentally ill. I’m not going to be friendly towards him again. Yes it’s a bad feeling.
174353681,I was on xepilon and they put me on a low dose of abilify to lower my prolactin. It didn’t work. So I just completely switched to abilify.
176046346,"I checked them, thanks!"
176046347,No that was just an example. I wasn’t referring to sarcasm. these examples are what i was experiencing… well that was a mouthful = you should just die i guess stand up with your back straight = i should punch you in your stupid face for every sentence spoken = an insult that rhymes somewhat with what was originally spoken. we might consider a CTO (community treatment order/forced injection) = if you come back here we will _PERSON_ kill you.
176046348,I’m in the middle of freaking out and trying to hold it together. Death is following me and it’s very terrifying. I tried to talk to the staff and they calmly say oh you’re being paranoid. I guess I come on here as you guys seem to be the only ones to understand me not necessarily means I accept the illness. I guess I dont accept anything right now but the horror that engulfs me
176046349,I tried to manifest myself mentally in an outcry to the invasion of my space. Sitting Indian style trying to represent to the schizophrenics under the same conditions as me.

174353679,Seeing some of the things she hallucinated as characters from scary movies is why I never watch horror movies. They just have the worst ideas for someone who has a disorder with hallucinations/delusions. Kind of like if I don’t know about it then it won’t come up.
176046356,i’m sorry. It was just a bad joke.
176046357,"Om, i am afraid my dad was a real psycho… He never drank though, but he was beating my mom and my sister to death… I sometimes think, that i inherited some kind of psychopathy too in fact But my mom says he loved me, no matter that he couldnt show it… Idk, maybe there really are the genetics too in our illness … MY dad suffered from depressions and other stuff too … Me too, i forgave lately… If he was ill too, some things can be understanded too… I am sorry for your dad… You are a friend, lets try to stay strong now .

176046363,"Allright, take care man. You sounded a bit delusional."
176046364,You can actually have psychosis once in your life and never again if it’s not sz. Your pdoc is wrong. Do you have a family history of sz? Is that why your dr assumed it would happen again?

ScienceDaily Increased brain acidity in psychiatric disorders Decreased brain pH in the patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has been considered to be the result of secondary factors associated with the diseases, such as medication and agonal state.

176046365,"My therapist didn’t force me to forgive them. He just suggests them. He’s a licensed therapist in Korea so he deals primarily with my case. He knows a lot about my abuse and even about my mom’s abuse to me. It’s like, with CPTSD you’re just frozen at that trauma. You just stop at that point. It’s not your fault. It was never your fault. Healing is not linear. It takes time, and some people take longer, some people take a short time to recover. One day, we’ll be ok."
174353685,There definitely isn’t a hidden microphone in you. I’m being honest. Your mind is playing tricks with you and some things seem real. Before I was diagnosed I thought there were hidden cameras and microphones everywhere. It’s a classic symptom of schizophrenia. It all seems so real but it’s not.
176046366,Any time I try to stick to a virtuous diet for a long time I start getting really bored with it. The odd _PERSON_ now and then will keep you sane. All those centenarians in places like Okinawa are poor people who have no choice but to do their own gardening and grow their own food. If they had a choice they wouldn’t be doing that. When you and I were cavemen our lives depended on us saving energy at every opportunity. That’s why people take the elevator on their way to the gym.

I don’t know how claims court works in your country, but if he refuses to pay, you should have a solid case. In my country, freelance labor contracts are not ironclad prices. They are estimates. If I paid a landscaper do a job, and an unforseen expense cropped up, I would expect me as the client to pay it. Here, if that happens, the laborer would write up a new estinate for the increased cost and make us sign it before starting on the extra work."

Antipsychotics block dopamine and stimulants boost dopamine. At low doses they did nothing, no benefits and no side effects so I stopped."
176046393,I told my pdoc that I dropped my current therapist and I asked her if she could refer me to another therapist that specializes in CBT. She referred me to a male LCSW social worker that works in the same town as her. She told me that he comes highly recommended and that he is familiar with bipolar disorder and psychosis. I have not seen a male social worker in years but I guess I’m open to the idea now. She gave me his name and cell phone number. I’ll give it some time and think about it more. But I really trust my doctors judgement. I forgot to mention that he doesn’t implement CBT.

176046398,Nice. That’s how I prefer to look at it also. The effeciency over the side effects. I’ve never become a member of a forum like this before and I’m glad I joined. There is so so much to learn from others. It’s quite beautiful actually.

I know I can’t engage in the relationships deeply, but think I’m getting better. I hope so."

Moreover, specific neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, are associated with deficits in _USER_ID_ transmission in these circuits. This technology may support studies on the roles of _USER_ID_ inhibitory interneurons in circuit physiology and learning, and support gene therapy treatments for specific disorders associated with deficits at _USER_ID_ synapses."

176046411,Honestly my life before sz was hell. No one deserves to be abused as a kid. I would pick my days of sz over my abuse experience.
176046412,"I believed that my sister was actually an alter. I actually took her to a therapy appointment to see if my therapist would acknowledge her as a real person. Even after I took her, I still didn’t believe she was real. Still to this day, because we have the same thoughts so often, I shiver and think is this a real person? Another one is that my son does not exist. He actually died at birth and needed to be revived. In a very long standing and recurring delusion they were unable to revive him. The son I’ve been taking care of does not exist and my family has been going along with the delusion because they know I’m not strong enough to handle the truth that he is actually dead. It’s not so hard now that he’s older but when he was an infant it was terrible to go through the motions of caring for him thinking he was actually a figment of my imagination."

176046420,Yeah I’d be asking for a change of meds to something else. Plenty of choice these days but it is a lottery. Could work well. May not. Still. Worth a try and self adjusting your meds isn’t the way to do it. Get your doc onboard and get them to listen to your concerns.

176046431,"You are not a failure. Sz is a disease that is not ours by choice. You are no more a failure than someone with some other disease that prevents them from participating in society. Every minded person have a understanding than people that live on different terms than them when it comes to health can’t contribute at the same level they do. And they don’t feel resentful about it. Almost everybody has someone in their family that has some debilitating disease, so I think society has a good understanding about this. Yet here you are contributing to this community at a regular basis. I think just that alone says something positive about you as a person. It’s not a given for people to do so at all.

176046436,I’m seriously considering going back on Abilify. It was a pretty good mood stabilizer but it made me extremely anxious. But I might be able to offset some of the anxiety by taking Klonopin. I was on it for over 10 years and never once was hospitalized. This way eventually I can eventually come off the Risperdal. My father suggested that I retry the Abilify this time without the Tegretol which interacts with the Abilify. I managed to lose a ton of weight and my blood glucose was normal. My negatives were non existent. I’m going to mention it to my doctor as soon as I can. _AT_MENTION_

176046446,"I’m reminded of this when I watch a certain British baking show where people are judged on their dishes. It tends to be that most people don’t respond negatively to criticisms they get and use it as an opportunity to learn something or they just admit, “Yeah, that didn’t come out right.”, usually followed by a lighthearted laugh. In my family (and I’ve noticed this seems prevalent in America generally…) no one takes even small criticisms too well. If I make something and admit, “Ah, it’s not quite what I wanted.” or admit that it’s just not that good, my mother tries to soften it and that kind of thing doesn’t feel good. It even looks a bit bad on her part. There’s another story I could tell and explain why I think this is important, but its a lot to say and explain. Personally, ‘criticism’ just needs to be received as a place to learn and grow. It only becomes a problem when we don’t think we can do better and start limiting our own abilities by refusing to try. Lea
rning can be fun. It SHOULD be fun. I explained to my niece that the reason I chose to make donuts so often isn’t because I wanted to eat them. It’s because I wanted them to come out ‘right’; because it was a challenge. Anyway, on the British baking show the bakers were challenged to make donuts. My grandma made a remark that you’re supposed to cook them on a low heat and I wanted to disagree… Why I remain hesitant isn’t because she’s old. It’s because she is rigid in her beliefs that she’s right regardless of what. And? Because she responds very harshly when someone disagrees with her. (I WONDER why???) I explained later to my mom that just because my grandma made donuts for them when she was younger and she thought they were good, doesn’t mean she made them well. I explained that actually, from what I learned, you don’t want to cook them in a low heat because that would cause the donuts to get too soggy. The heat needs to be just hot enough that a ‘crust’ forms on the outside so 
as to avoid the inside absorbing too much oil. An oily donut? No thanks! There are standards and we have standards for good reason. It isn’t about being ‘obsessive’ or whatever excuse people want to have about it… Was that a rant?"

176046460,I don’t think they are hallucinations…wicked witches and wizards are behind it…My divorced ‘mother’ exposed her panties to me and I think it was deliberate because I don’t see how a grown woman will not know that she was exposing herself in her ‘son’s’ room…

Our rationale lay in the interrelations between these concepts suggested in a conceptual framework of IMR.The cross-sectional design used baseline data of outpatient participants in a randomized clinical trial on IMR (N = 187). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to describe pathways between degrees of insight, medication adherence, addiction, coping and social support, and degree of clinical, functional and personal recovery. We also explored whether clinical recovery mediat
ed functional and personal recovery.Our final model showed that coping was associated with clinical, functional and personal recovery. Direct associations between coping and functional and personal recovery were stronger than indirect associations via clinical recovery. Although SEM also showed a significant but weak direct pathway between social support and functional recovery, there were no significant pathways either between social support and clinical or personal recovery, or between insight, medication adherence, addiction and any type of recovery.Coping may be a determinant of all three types of recovery, and social support a determinant of functional recovery. Clinical recovery appears not to be a prerequisite for functional or personal recovery. While our results also suggest the relevance of improving coping skills and of enhancing social support, they only partially support the conceptual framework of IMR."

176046599,"I was pretty upset when I had my first review. It went fine, however."
176046600,I weighed 56.4kg about a month ago (I am 160cm) but I was given several kg of Swedish lollies and ate them all in two days and on top of that ate lots of other things so I have put on weight. I was looking rather good in jeans and singlet and now my stomach sticks out way past my boobs and it’s not a good look. Last year this time I was only 53kg and my body was looking really good. I wore a little dress and high heel boots to a party and it looked good actually. Strange thing is I did not exercise Strange thing is when I joined the gym I went up to 55kg and I was 55kg for around nine months and went up to 56.4kg when I became a vegetarian. So I think I have put on several kg from 56.4 kg but I do not want to weigh myself. I just don’t want the disappointment of seeing how many kg I put on as it’s so hard to lose weight. I think I put on weight when I go to the gym because I eat more. When I was 53 kg I only had a belvita breakfast biscuits for breakfast with coffee and a weight watchers bar a
nd coffee for lunch and whatever the x was having for dinner which included deep fried food so I ate a “normal” dinner but very little for breakfast and lunch.cant remember if I had fruit at all. I want to lose weight but I don’t feel ready to commit to a diet. Specially as I’m a vegetarian and go to the gym.

Chronic Super stress ain’t no good for mental health. And thinking oh, maybe with a phase of self improvement I will then feel good enough doesn’t work either because… Of the pressure I then place on myself for self improvement… It is of an unhealthy type of pressure that would break me. I place this sort of pressure automatically on myself idk how not to. That’s just how I function. Under such circumstances. Badly. In conclusion, I have to give up on the idea that I could be close to them. Because whichever way I look at it, I am actually in reality
, not attractive to them. Due to what I just said above. The way I function. Etc. Also, sometimes, the person I’m attracted to, I feel like I’m just the leftover because the better ones are taken, Or they are somehow just not available.

The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients’ comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novel Do androids dream of electric sheep ? by _NAME_. The _PERSON_ clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that _NAME_ attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of huma
n empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if _PERSON_ were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the _PERSON_ androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commenting Do androids dream of electric sheep ?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; t
o analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by _PERSON_."

I really don’t think you have anything to worry about, it would be poor practice to banish people to hell just because they have schizophrenia. If it helps, just remind yourself that there are children with schizophrenia who are being told the same thing, and it certainly can’t be true for them. They’re innocent at that age. So really it’s just a hallucination you should try not to take seriously. I’m sorry you’re getting these types of voices, I hope they either get nicer or go away soon.

176046831,"Exactly, I’ve got ocd, not sz as claimed by some overzealous doctors. I feel guilty being here."
176046832,"A good start is the acknowledgement that the mind can be tuned one way or the other. It’s easy to start with something that’s unattached to your current framework. Take a coin, or a paperclip or something. Hold it and think about it being alien in nature. Try to push it really far in that direction, but not so far you can’t come back from it. Then return to neutral. Then go in the other direction. Think about how that object is the least alien thing on the entire planet. Then go back to just thinking of it as a random coin or paperclip. Did the thing itself change at all? Nope. You just changed your perception of it. And if you could do that with a coin or paperclip, maybe you can do it with your _PERSON_ counter, or even your view of yourself and how you fit into the world. It helps to practice the technique with a coin or paperclip for a while. Just spend a few minutes every day working on it. You can change what the variable is too. Make it how “good” or “bad” it is, how “special
” or “ordinary” it is, etc. Even multiple variables at one time (“very special and very good”, “very bad but very unimportant and ordinary”). Because the thing holding you to your delusion isn’t the _PERSON_ counter. You’re using that to rationalize the underlying delusion, and you know it, but you are having trouble letting go of it. You’re using a maximum reading of the _PERSON_ counter as a reference instead of its minimum. Anything less than 100 or 2.5 times whatever your local area’s reference station is (different parts of the country have different readings at any given time) - is normal. So work on trying to change how you interpret things, and actively push your thinking in directions you want it to be instead of directions you fear it to be. I could make an argument that obscure radiological variations seems a pretty unlikely form of communication, but until you abandon the underlying thought process, your brain is simply going to come up with a rationalization for why that cou
ld or should be the case. Attack the underlying delusion or world view if it’s not one you want to hold on to. It’s possibly to shift the thinking, but it takes practice and having meds to regulate your fluctuations of thought help a lot in keeping control."

176046864,"The Purpose of Shame What may surprise many people is that far from being a useless, destructive emotion, shame actually serves an important purpose and is part of our survival mechanism. In fact shame is borne out of a deep sense of caring - to feel shame you have to care and without shame there would be no empathy. At a primal level (from where all our emotions arise), our survival as humans is dependent upon being part of a tribe. To be shunned or ostracized by the tribe would threaten our very survival, therefore we need to ensure our acceptance. Similarly, as human infants we are wholly dependent upon our primary caregivers to keep us alive - we are unable to fend for ourselves for many years. To ensure our safety, and therefore the continuity of the species, the human body has developed ways and means to maintain these bonds between both our caregivers and the tribe at large. Our body has its own pharmacy and drives our behavior with a chemical reward and punishment system. Proximity to the c
aregiver promotes the release of a ‘happy pill’ - a blend of dopamine, oxytocin, and our own natural opioids - that rewards us for staying safe. Separation from the caregiver will induce a stress cascade with the release of cortisol followed by adrenaline as the fight or flight response is launched - the body’s ‘cattle prod’ to force us back into the safety of our tribe. So we are programmed at a chemical level to stay close to our caregivers and, like any love-drug, our internal chemicals also imbue us with a sense that these people can do no wrong! However, humans are human, and parents (however well-intentioned) are not always the ‘gods’ our chemistry may lead us to believe. So what happens when a parent or caregiver behaves in a way that is either hurtful or even harmful to a child? Believing that the caregiver is wrong would destabilize the child’s whole survival mechanism - to break the narrative that “this person is supposed to keep me safe” would lead to a cognitive dissonance that 
borders on madness. Therefore, it becomes easier to believe that “I must have done something wrong to provoke this” or that “I am a bad person” rather than believe that one’s security blanket is full of holes. While our fight or flight response would normally drive us to ‘get out of Dodge’ when we are under threat, this is not typically an option for a small child. So we do the next best thing - dive deep inside ourselves and hide. This is known as the shutdown response and it is the home of depression. It is too scary for children to believe that their caregivers are bad so shame is actually the safest option. Self-blame is the result of the individual trying to gain some control - when something is too big or bad to fathom, if you blame yourself then you are at least taking some action. Re-Framing Shame While shame clearly served a purpose during childhood, now that we are grown up and know that our caregivers are simply human and have their flaws like everyone else, the shame narrative is no 
longer useful. However, the emotional programming of the body chemistry and nervous system responses are still wired for the shame response. Now every time we experience criticism, someone raises his or her voice, or we experience behavior that evokes those childhood memories, then the frame of shame locks in. We return to the self-blame narrative and potentially retreat into the shutdown mode that provided us with shelter in the past. With our adult sense of reason we may try to ‘logic’ our way out of it, but this all too often turns back to the language of self-blame: “you’re being stupid”; “this response is inappropriate”; “why do you always react this way?”. However, there is a fundamental reason why this reasoning strategy cannot work. Shame is not a thought, it is a feeling. When someone experiences shame it evokes an unpleasant bodily sensation that is typically felt below the diaphragm in the abdominal area. It is a primitive emotion that predates the existence of the ‘logical’ p
art of our brains. In fact when we experience shame, the areas that deal with logic are suppressed and no wiring exists to relay messages of reason down to the lower areas that are producing these sensations. We cannot think our way out of this maze, so we need to turn to our bodies. The shame response can be reprogrammed but this can only be done by changing what is going on in the body, and the unpleasant sensations actually need to be online for us to do that. So the next time you feel a shame response, rather than thinking “oh no, here we go again….”, you should welcome it as an opportunity for change. Strategies One of the greatest antidotes for shame is social connection with a trusted partner, friend, or family member - someone that you know will not judge you. Animals can also be wonderful allies on this journey if there is a trusting bond between you. Here’s how it works: When we experience those feelings deep down below the diaphragm and find ourselves wanting to shut off from the world, thi
s means that a primitive part of our nervous system has been activated (the dorsal branch of our Vagus Nerve for any anatomy geeks out there!). This is a remnant from our reptilian ancestry that sends us into a state of paralysis in the face of a threat - reptiles effectively play dead in the hope that the predator will pass them by. In order to bring us out of this state, we need to get a little ‘kick’ from our sympathetic nervous system to mobilize us back into regular mode. Then, we need to come back into social connection to reassure ourselves that we are still part of the tribe - this is where the mutual gaze of a trusted friend or even a pet comes in. Eye contact serves to bring our parasympathetic nervous system online which signals to the body that all is well and the threat has passed. Physical contact can also be reassuring - the touch of a hand, or a calming hand on the shoulder. Airing and sharing the underlying issue and shining a light on it is also very powerful if you feel safe to do so. I
n the words of _NAME_ “What you resist not only persists, but will grow in size” - by constantly suppressing the feelings of shame, they will remain a part of your emotional pattern and will become amplified over time. Darkness is obliterated by light and when you finally share your burden of shame, its power will be removed forever. Here are some steps to help you on that journey: Awareness When you feel triggered into a shame state, become aware of the sensations you are experiencing. Perhaps it is a queasy feeling in the gut, tightness around the solar plexus area, or butterflies. For some this may be followed by a slide towards a shutdown response. Become familiar with these sensations, analyze and catalog them as they will be your cues that the system is online and available for reprogramming. Keep the body in the present As those feelings start to appear and you feel like you want to disappear, bring yourself into the present moment. Here are some ways to do that: Bring your awareness to your feet o
n the ground or your pelvis in the chair Tap or pat your arms or legs to bring awareness to your periphery Regulate your breathing pattern by breathing in to the count of 4 and out to the count of 4 Hum so that you can feel the vibration of your lips and throughout the whole body Social Connection Find a trusted friend with whom you can make eye contact - ideally, prep them beforehand so they know to be there for you. This can also be done with a trusted pet whose non-judgmental gaze will be equally soothing. The physical contact of the touch of a hand or stroking the pet can further strengthen the connection. Airing and sharing If you feel comfortable to do so, sharing your thoughts verbally can also be useful as long as there is no judgement from the other party. The tendency to suppress or repress the underlying thoughts only makes them stronger. Repetition Repeat these sequences whenever the feelings of shame arise. Remember that reprogramming our emotional responses is no different to learning how to rid
e a bike or play an instrument - repetition and practice get the job done! There is a famous saying that refers to how the body programs itself: “What fires together wires together” (_NAME_). If you always repeat the pattern of shutdown when the shame response is triggered, then the body will get very good at doing it! By choosing an alternate response, with repetition the body will wire the new sensations to the trigger of shame. These are some basic steps you can take to overcome feelings of shame, but if those patterns are deeply entrenched, then it would be wise to seek the guidance of a mental health professional to help you on the journey. Modalities such as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprogramming) and Somatic Experiencing have shown to be very quick and effective methods of re-framing the shame response. When shame is allowed to persist it infiltrates so many aspects of our lives and how we respond to others, and can stop us from fulfilling our greatest potential as human beings. Shini
ng a light on shame, naming it, and re-framing it can free us from this unnecessary burden and allow us to reconnect with a sense of joy and purpose. Remove the frame of shame and paint yourself a new portrait instead. The Big Picture Shame frames us into a self-perpetuating loop where self-blame, self-sabotage, and generalized anxiety abound. The internal narrative of shame will turn “I did something bad today” into “I am a bad person”. It lowers self-esteem so we expect to do badly, then when we do, shame says “I told you so!” and the cycle continues. However, shame is a protective mechanism that at some point in our history kept us safe - it had a purpose. When we understand how and why our shame patterns began, we can begin to unravel the programming that keeps us in the shame frame. By deleting the old programming and introducing a new pattern, we can break out of the frame and paint a new portrait that shows our fullest potential."

What I meant to say in a previous post is that even my sister in law is concerned about _NAME_ being an insufferable control freak. Even she’s expressed that he’s got to stop it, because I think he’s alienated his stepdaughter as a result.

176046936,"Hi everyone. I’m having some issues lately. I’ve been diagnosed with SZA disorder since 3 yrs now. Everything has been going in the right direction with all the meds and support I’m getting, until recently. Two weeks ago I stopped sleeping completely. Lots of energy and thoughts about cleaning and rearranging the house during the night! During the day my energy levels are minimal but when the dark comes, here’s where it all starts. No matter what I do I just cannot fall asleep, even sleeping pills don’t work. I had to take tavor last night to finally get some sleep. What’s interesting is that in the morning I don’t feel worn out, everything is normal, I can take care of the child, cook, clean etc. function normally. My doctor told me this could be an onset of mania. I used to have it before, same sleep disturbance, same energy rush. Ah and I forgot the optimism.

176046946,Yes logic or thinking practically is the only way to manage delusion and other symptoms (both positive and negative). Medications like AP will help you to better think logically but its the logical thinking the only way to manage delusion. When someone take AP medicine it simply helps that individual to think logically as in some even after taking AP delusion will not go away fully. Thus logical thinking is the best way to manage such in both cases whether take medication or not.

176046962,"my pdoc is switching me around on a bunch of anxiety meds. i havent had problems with it, but i fear getting erectile dysfunction. does anyone else suffer from this? do you know if you stop taking the med in question, will the _NAME_ go away? i dont like the idea of risking an erection. that’s one of life’s basic pleasures and it would suck not to have it."
174353823,"_AT_MENTION_ i swear it happened when i was in psychosis. I was thinking about something related to death and where our souls go etc and another patient (also in psychosis) replied to that without me saying anything to him. Then i was thinking about something and then i thought my mom will give its answer and she said exactly what i was thinking about. More similar things happened. I do believe there was some telepathy going on. I read in a book too that this could happen in schizophrenia. They did an experiment with 2 people in 2 different rooms influencing each others thoughts and doing some mild telepathic stuff. But it can’t be controlled, like you cant sit and decide to do it. It just happens automatically and stop automatically in psychosis/schizophrenia sometimes."

176046967,"That clicking noise could have been a hallucination. I rarely get auditory hallucinations, but when i do get them -they are very sneaky and clever. Plays into whatever my current delusion is. Also the body makes noises and has sensations all the time. Im sorry you’re suffering with trying to figure this thing out. I dont know if this is any help, but try to think about the broader picture. Why are they spying on you? If they are, why do you care? The movie about _NAME_ snowden proves that the CIA can watch anyone on any device at any time. I dont bring this up to trigger you or anyone else reading this. I mention it to point out: why would they suddenly put something in your ear, when they already have the option of listening to you on a computer or phone? (Again not trying to trigger anyone, but this is a reality of the world. Just remember, even though they can listen in, why would they??)"

174353832,"I don’t take anything that causes drowsiness because I need to stay alert, and besides, most are terribly bad for the liver which causes severe itching which many don’t even realize where it comes from. I hate meds because of the side effects but I’ve been taking Adderall for ADD since 2004. Yes, it can increase schizophrenia symptoms because the demon is mood based. Feelings of aggravation, embarrassment, and nervousness trigger the demon, therefore Adderall which excites your mood, can cause your mood to become negatively effected when an outside environment tries to interfere, in my case, the demon. Of course, I have learned to cope with this mood and it helps to keep your health in check, especially with schizophrenia. Most important, a deficiency in potassium, vitamin D3, or magnesium causes severe central nervous system attacks such as anxiety and aggravation, but are also needed the most since the body depletes them the quickest of all vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. Every day 
I will eat: 1 or 2 avocados for potassium 10,000 to 20,000 IUs vitamin D3 (or 15 minutes of sun equivalent to 20,000 IUs) 250 mg magnesium (depletes faster when taking Adderall) Adding a multivitamin gummy isn’t really ok for me from experience. I prefer a healthier choice like tuna with salad, some juice, anything with tons of vegetables, low sugar foods because we should all know that it’s the actual reason we gain weight."

Why are you so against the thought of you not having a normal brain? You’re willing to admit yoy have autism, autism brains are abnormal. What’s so horrible about having a brain with schizophrenia? It’s just another diagnosis. I don’t like this back and forth. It’s not healthy for you to keep ruminating on the subject, and it’s not healthy for me to try (and fail to) change your mind."

174353826,"If I may add, risperidone does not do much for my motivation compared to abilify and zyprexa. Going from olanzapine to risperidone is like going from 400hp sedan to 80hp pick-up truck. Heavy, slow and under powered."
174353831,"Dont delete you account over one person. Then you’ll just be alone in this again. There are a lot of dumb rules on here and some very rude people who use this forum to bully everyone who thinks differently about schizophrenia. I call it a spiritual attack but whatever you call it, it is still here. Certain people don’t understand why you could possibly think this is anything but a malfunction when there is actually a lot of beauty in the voices. They can’t believe because talking back is a no-no and you’re giving the voices sentience when you believe that they are something external. You do what works for you and just skip over the posts that don’t relate to your topic. He thinks it’s his job to police every schizophrenic into thinking like him. It’s okay. You have friends here."
176046980,"Sure, I think stem cells have a lot of potential. The ethical issues have to do with stem cells derived from fetuses, but that would not be a practical source of theraputic stem cells anyway. They would want to use lab created cells in people for many reasons - consistency, availability, safety, ability to personalize them and avoid rejection, etc. There’s not really an ethical issue with lab created stem cells, or stem cells grown by your own body in response to a drug."

Of course it was impossible to live without meds after 1.5 years, I was paranoid of everyone even my family. This means that negative and cognitive symptoms are not necessarily permanent and could be treated by future meds. I have no cognitive or negative symptoms when unmedicated or while on Abilify."
176046983,"Thanks everyone I was ok at the airport and traveling, I found getting an iced coffee before boarding helped me stay alert and endure the short trip to my location. I was kind of scared at certain points of my trip. I thought something bad was going to happen when I was at the local art museum and when I was at the beach but luckily nothing happened. Hopefully I will make it to my move in a couple of days. I would like to see my friends and volunteering. I was glad to see my parents and my sibling."

But if the rep hasn’t even dropped samples off to office yet, _PERSON_ won’t let her write for it as it’s an unknown drug to them. I have to wait for _PERSON_ to get their ass kissed before care will be considered. That’s what my pdoc said, she is very irritated. But if somehow we get the paperwork rolling, she is thinking of writing for lowest dose and next dose up 1 each day that way if the office shuts cause of Coronavirus like has been talked about, she’ll write 2 months of each dose if insurance will pay it. My records are open to insurance office, I have failed all drugs and am med resistant, this is supposed to be the fix. And if they approve both doses they may even do a year for free for each dose. But my next year will give me a heart attack. I’m also having her do as many xanax refills as she can, if anything adding a 
third pill a day so I have a PRN if she’s locked out of office. Also my Belsomra 15mg doesn’t make me tired, may have to up and if we do then ask for several refills if possible. I know the Belsomra is another reauthorize because they have maybe 5 peoe in it in the whole practice. And I’m highest freaking dose."

The reason it doesn’t work for some people I think is that there are ineffective brands out there. Look for something that says “suntheanine” on the bottle, then you know what you’re getting. Also you have to go up dosage wise. Like 100/200mg isn’t much good."

Another study I read indicated that it can be at least as efficacious as Tegretol, which is slightly less efficacious than Depakote…still, consider that Depakote is simply the fastest for stopping mania. And at least as efficacious as Lithium in treating acute mania, if not more so. Still, both Tegretol and Trileptal are slow. …Trileptal works. It is doing something for me, but I think not nearly enough. I’m still manic, but I would rather not be. Has anyone taken Trileptal for moods? What dose worked?"

174353848,"Hi. I’m not new to this website. I used to post here a lot, but stopped after believing I didn’t suffer with a psychotic disorder, but I was most likely wrong… Something’s been bothering me for the longest of time, and it is something extremely personal and that I never talk about so I please ask to be sensitive about the topic. Anyway, I’ve been with my partner for almost 5 years. Since I was about 17 and he, 18. I somehow got this delusional thought where he and my own mother has been sneaking behind my back. It didn’t start until after 2 years of being together. We broke up last year, yet kept in contact since. We’ve had some time apart though, especially since he moved a couple hours away, and I wouldn’t think or even consider that delusion anymore (in that time being apart). It wasn’t until lately that since we’ve considered working things out and getting back together, that it happened again and it’s worse now because there has been so many coincidences (in my mind, at l
east, and I put them together and it makes sense). It is seriously crippling and killing me. In the past, when it was worse, I had confronted them about it, only because I would break down and it was hard to hide, and they would reassure me, more than once, that nothing was going on. Which would give me temporary relief, but it’s happening again. I don’t know what to do. What should I do? To help with these delusions or the whole situation. I can’t take it anymore. It kills me so much inside… it’s honestly been making me suicidal too."

176047033,Yeah it could have been the antidepressant that triggered some mania and psychotic thinking. Go see a qualified psychiatrist as soon as you can. You may need to be on a mood stabilizer or possibly an antipsychotic while you are on an antidepressant.

176047057,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo
u’re just daydreaming to observers."
176047058,There are some volunteer opportunities that involve gardening and weeding. An example is at https://www.volunteermatch.org/results/opp_detail.jsp?oppid=2648163
176047059,I guess I should mention I’m on Medicare.
176047060,"It’s especially important for folks who are elderly or who have underlying medical conditions to stay away from the public if possible to reduce their chance of contracting COVID-19. With that said, it is also important to stay physically and mentally healthy and getting fresh air and exercise is part of this. My elderly mom continues to go on daily walks in her neighborhood but ensures she stays the recommended 6 feet away from others, for example if she stops to chat with someone."
176047061,Don’t worry about the neighbors. Your brother forgives you. Your mom loves you. Maybe get some benzos to help with freaking out. I hope you feel better.
176047062,Sorry you’re not feeling well.
176047063,I think to much sleep could be bad for you especially when you are taking meds that will wear you down. Try and talk to a doctor about this and don’t forget about the part that you sleep to much.
176047064,Does ibs occur only as constipation.i have only pschological constipation.
176047065,My condolences rox. Were you guys close?
176047066,"Thank you no title, will do!"
176047067,I doubt it. But you really need to get with the program and become committed to taking your meds.

176047069,heres an article it says it will still work on the mutated covid. Will coronavirus vaccines work against new variant? University of Pennsylvania doctor weighs in - 6abc Philadelphia
176047070,_AT_MENTION_ I’m going to the doctor soon (calling Monday) but I’m thinking later on… I’m kinda lonely today
174353862,I am happy that it wasn’t permanent. I feared that its permanent but it stopped shortly after stopping Abilify.
176047071,"I feel bad because recently I had to fire someone at my job because of their ADHD/Anxiety/learning disability cause it was too fast paced and my co managers didn’t want to do it. I feel half and half about it, I know I’m .mentally ill and coping alright and high functioning, but when I see other people who let it destroy them I kind of get upset but I also just feel bad for them that it’s so serious. Just my personal thoughts on stress and stuff I guess"
176047072,"I don’t think too much.I just go and do my work,isn’t this what everybody is doing?Going to work,doing business or studying"
176047073,All of the psychotic ones. I don’t hear voices or talk to myself.
176047074,You can’t do that to start with. You have to conform and sell out until you can afford that life.
176047075,Starting on it also. Hopeful.
174353858,I gave up fighting remaining symptoms like severe negative symptoms. I still have a hard time accepting them.
176047076,"yeah they offered benzos to me too also they wrote that I was a danger to others and myself in the documents needed for involuntary admission because its one of the criteria even though i wasnt apparently being psychotic counts I am so sorry for your experience, hope you are okay now"
176047077,When was the last time you worked? How long did it last?
176047078,Drive safe! 1515
176047079,Sometimes it’s poverty of speech But not sure if that’s from meds Or just the illness.
176047080,"Without meds I am instantly paranoid, delusional and hallucinate but I stayed med free for a year until I had psychosis and tried to kill myself. I ended up in the emergency hospital and then transferred to mental hospital. Not worth it."
176047081,Like an natural order when you biologically break it down.
176047082,Thank you You too. What medication are you currently on?
176047083,Happy Birthday _AT_MENTION_!!!
176047084,Yes I do. Moreover i get images of new manager shouting at me as well almost for every ocassion.
176047085,"It doesn’t work I tried inserting them from my Android keyboard too, maybe not supported. But I believe you can insert them by uploading the picture."
176047086,"I like my carbs too, I can relate. I eat mostly vegetarian at home (I go out when I want meat, except for frozen _NAME_ chicken tenderloins). Peanut butter sandwiches, Morningstar black bean burgers, _NAME_’s frozen meals, Bagel Bites…I am always in my calorie ranges, but my protein is always under my goal. I have no problem hitting my carb goals though! What is your BMI? Is it possible that 160 is the right weight for you? I think I remember you saying that you are 5’8"" which is three inches more than I am. My goal weight is around 180. I probably can get lower, but I don’t want to go under 1200-1400 calories per day. I will stop losing when I naturally hit the weight where my 1200-1400 calories is what I need to maintain. I don’t know what that will be for me, but maybe you are already at the right weight? That might be something to consider. You seem to naturally maintain 158-161, maybe that is where you are meant to be? Also, are you in menopause? I know weight is harder to shift whe
n you’re in menopause. I am already seeing it in perimenopause. True, I fight Zyprexa, but perimenopause doesn’t help! Two days ago I had to rearrange my meal schedule to fit in a snack because I was hungry…this morning I woke up with a period after not having one for a few months. No wonder! I pushed my limits two days ago - 1391 calories. Hey, I was under 1400! Other than that, all I can think of is to eat more veggies. The added fiber may help you. Fiber is another goal I never hit. I’m always under."
176047087,"I was on the pills, never felt so bad in my entire life."
174353855,Schizoaffective Some sort of ptsd Social anxiety Gerd Could be better. Could be worse. I’m still vertical so I count myself lucky.
176047088,I felt that I lost my energy and emotions on meds that aren’t partial dopamine agonists.
176047089,All meds have downsides. Her doctors think her best option is clozapine. Telling her she shouldn’t take it is not helpful.
174353856,"In my case positive symptoms are better. I only have tactile hallucinations which I can manage. My worst positive symptoms are delusions, but I can function without having a psychotic break. I’ve been psychotic most of my life but I can live with that. But I’m taking APs currently and negative symptoms scare me even though I already have them. I don’t want them to get worse."
176047090,"Free will could be a variable or something that could be turned on and off like a switch. We don’t know. We might have a little free will. But then inside the sim, we have mentally ill people who experience altered states of consciousness that might have the illusion they are robots as well as having delusions of those sort of things. I experienced this. I have recovered. I believe in determinism and am a compatibilist (w/e). I believe I escaped the SIMS (Matrix) and helped program, run it, etc. I’m lucky and unfortunate and one of the few. You can change it like Age of Empires and crap. There might be humans as well as aliens outside running things. It might be left on it’s own. There could be thousands or perhaps trillions such ‘automated’ programs around running without an ‘admin’. It could be a grand experience or experiment to test different conditions or outcomes. Exactly like a simulation or oracle machine or ???? lol. Hell, we might not exist as humans or be real outside the s
imulation. Life or physics could be radically different. We might not even be possible outside the simulation where ‘higher’ beings live. I know a lot or profess too. What we experience as 13 billion years, might be an illusion. They’re memory or cognition might span multiple dimensions or timelines and is unfathomable (their intelligence). We might be ants or primates compared to them. It might not be possible to understand them given our limits in physics or the constraints they put us in. This artificial primitive prison. Imagine to them that 13 billion years (age of our universe) is like a second to them or less. They could have infinite brain capacity and memory. That’s my theory anyways. While our universe resets or dies (from our perspective) their universe doesn’t. Thus they can see and know practically everything. Imagine a windows browser that can see anything and anywhere on planet earth (string theory computer code). This goes with my memories and beliefs. Imagine opening up some compute
r windows with coordinates of Earth and seeing everything and anything. Even getting into people’s minds and reading their thoughts. Perhaps, people like me are being targeted for ‘knowing too much’. Sometimes, I feel like I know too little haha!"
176047091,I am not a doctor but studied a bit of medicine and I have a degree in physiotherapy. Why are your symptoms bothering you? Are you able to take care of yourself? Are you able to work? If yes to any of those questions then sarcosine won’t help you.
176047092,????. It wants nothing.
176047093,i only put on a mask once going so far. I guess I’m supposed to.
176047094,Anyway how are y’all
176047095,Dude I’m totally consumed in an actively idle lifestyle. Like I’m actively just sitting around writing poetry listening to music and pacing. Idk I can’t get myself to commit to an every day structure so I just kinda isolate and pass the time A word that comes to mind why I’m so idle is that I am “sensitive” some days more than others but I can’t risk putting myself out there daily in fear of my bad days.
176047096,"I understand your concerns, but be careful not to burn your bridges. You may get psychotic in the future and need them. Who’s gonna support your reviews for pip, if you tell them to do one? I hate to say it, and it’s wrong, but sometimes you gotta grovel. My bet is you will just get a standard response anyway. Just be sure you know what your doing. But yeah, Very well written."
174353868,"It depends if its spread to other organs. My uncle was stage 4, it had already spread to his liver and intestines. Eventually it spread to his brain and heart, he died from a heart attack during a coma."
174353867,"I have no idea yet. I’m seeing my pdoc today. I’m hoping for either upping my seroquel or adding abilify but we will see what she says. My last doctor brought up the idea of vraylar, but it doesn’t seem so effective from what I have read"

176047102,"Drove to the food bank after work today and drove through to pick up my bag of weekly fruits and vegetables. I guess, because I came right when they were closing they gave me two bags full instead of the usual one bag. The grapes look delicious and the nectarines and oranges were a thing of beauty."
176047103,I relate. My family avoids me and I have only one friend to my name and she is more mentally ill than I am.
176047104,I think it’s unnecesary to ask this.

176047107,"So my husband and my momma sat down with me and told me I may have to get hospitalized involuntarly, because I keep talkin nonsense. And my geodon hasn’t made too much a difference. I notice I’m goin down hill again. I’m scared of what will happen to my girls. I’m scared, paranoid, mind is racing a mile a minute. I feel split again. Like I’m not here."

176047112,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ . Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer Moderator"

176047123,"I’m not saying you are but it sounds as though you are comparing yourself to others, simply ask yourself, “who was I yesterday?” and “how can I build on that?” it’s really helped me and i just wanted to share that with anyone else. best wishes for you friend."
176047124,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . You guys are really nice.
174353870,HI have any of you come across the whole targeted individual theory and what do you think of it if you have Schizophrenia. Be glad to hear from you.

176047134,"I trust no one on this issue except my soon-to-be-ex shrink. I told him these people have no sense or respect of personal space. I personally always think that I’m somehow invading the neighbors space. The funny part I discovered is that anywhere I go in my apartment these guys are invading my space. Everyone here is mentally ill and it seems like they are almost a physical presence in any room. I’ve been living with no space for two years and about 80% of the time I feel defensive, usually from two of the idiots. I have to say though I feel lucky that I get to experience first hand people who are supposedly cool acting like cowards and seeing how rotten and low they can go. Damn hypocrites. My shrink understands."
176047135,Do you mean someone creative? What makes them create?
176047136,my last voices were in 2010 at the psych ward

176047141,"I’ve been taking amyloban for about a year now and wouldn’t do without it. I take the full dose of 6 pills and it really works. I had energy problems for many years and started taking Ritalin to help before I started amyloban. The Ritalin caused my voices to come back. Even when I stopped the Ritalin they were still there. That’s when I discovered amyloban on this site from _AT_MENTION_ . The voices went away and eventually I went back to Ritalin and the voices are not there now. This is clear proof to me that it does work, and continues to work"

176047147,"Ive talked to myself since I was a little kid, as if someone was listening. At first it was just pretend but nowadays I do it and lose myself in it. I often feel as though there is someone missing physically present. Like theres two of me and _PERSON_ trying to keep the other me from getting lonely while simultaneously keeping myself sane in doing so. I remember when I was 14 I googled if it was normal, and people on yahoo answers (or quora…? I forget) said basically it was normal. But I do it as often as I can. Keeps me sane I tell ya. Hbu?"
174353879,"Really starting to believe I have someone else’s consciousness inside me, it’s the way the _NAME_ said ‘ I am U’ and ‘schizo dosent exist’ my voices told me ‘there are no schizophrenics, well I’m sure there are but your not one of them’ and also tell me things and say ‘would your schizophrenia know that’ Maybe they never left me and only turn it on in times of stress and when I activate them"
176047148,Really cool. You should post more!
176047149,What makes you regret? (if regret is the right word)

176047152,it is hard to be med-free dealing with psychosiss
174353877,"Not sure what you mean. What was written is pretty much what I’ve been experiencing, not what I believe. I think it was also mentioned somewhere that I am unable to believe anything, unless my Schizophrenia wants me to believe in something in particular (also from experience)."

176047156,We’ve told you many times to get in touch with your psychiatrist. Tell him what you told us and what are your thoughts and fears. You need new meds or higher dosage.
176047157,I don’t tell anyone. I don’t want them thinking I will kill them. My family knows and they think I’m possessed.
176047158,I had a bar of Pope On A Rope Soap once. Used it in the shower.
176047159,Wow what are the odds of that.
176047160,Of course I’m going to have to say this is the best poem ever.
176047161,_AT_MENTION_ please don’t harm yourself! Keep writing poems! I like your poems!
176047162,very cool!
176047163,I don’t think I learned anything from the voices themselves but I do feel the mind is more powerful than people give it credit. It can betray you and it can help you. You can forget the worst thing and remember it decades later when you are ready.
174353885,And how do you know mine aren’t severe? I stay in bed all day! Look I am not arguing with you. On Abilify I got a university degree and was going to the gym 5x/week and hanged out with lots of friends everyday. In my case its the meds causing severe negative symptoms.
176047164,Agree or disagree?..
176047165,"same here, imo they were not ‘‘true’’ friends, I have relised this now"

174353882,Why do you need to bring schizophrenia up? Does it matter so much its not like it is actually who you are if she likes your personality and you have common interests you have nothing to bring up maybe after the bedsheets and she’s in love with you and asks why you don’t work… if you bring up weird delusions and she starts asking herself whats wrong with you you can tell her.
176047174,I used to write freelance. I’ve ghostwritten a few books and have one novel under my own name.
176047175,Why not
176047176,I’ve looked at this before it’s what my research always led to.
176047177,Very nice _AT_MENTION_!
176047178,"An update: I am running now, and wow! It feels great! I am learning how to discipline myself and find that I am often pushing myself harder than I could have ever imagined. Also, the b vitamins are so key for relaxation and focus. I am very happy with my mind right now, and know it will only get better."
176047179,I often knock the timer dial by accident

176047181,why did it make her lazy? maybe she was depressed?
176047182,_PERSON_ I read that too but 3% is extremely rare. You must have had mild symptoms or have drug induced psychosis that stopped after stopping street drugs.
176047183,Fluphentixol can be used as an antidepressant in lower doses
176047184,I have trouble with motivation too and it’s really tough. I just try to distract myself and do things I can when I can. Don’t know how else to cope with it. Goal setting is so difficult! My husband motivates me though so fortunately I have some support in that way.
176047185,"Oh, on showering/bathing… I usually only shower every few days, sometimes maybe only after a week or two. Even though I always feel better after a shower, I end up feeling unmotivated to get in… Especially since I hear my bf’s family complain about how much hot water I use, since when I do shower, I like it hot enough that I look like a lobster when I’m done; it’s the most relaxing for me that way."
176047186,I went through 6 mental health professionals with varying titles before I found the therapist that has helped me more than words can describe. It’s unfortunate that there seem to be to many money hungry schmucks out there. I hope you’re able to find the right person soon.
176047187,At the moment: The Byrds Grateful dead 13 floors elevators Townes Vand Zand The _NAME_ Jonestown Massacre Spacemen 3 Kigakagu Moyo Jesus on Heroine And always: _NAME_ _USER_ID_ and family.

176047191,"I don’t have a source, but I read somewhere that doctors could see if a person was schizophrenic just on their posture. Maybe it’s mostly a genetic illness. Idk"
176047192,Post a song/ video to mark the occasion. I’m going to bed soon…very tired.
176047193,"no supplements will work, you are wasting your time, only right antipsychotic medication will work, are you taking any? What dose? taking supplement for delusions is like taking protein powder and not actually exercising."
174353888,"i think my life has improved as my symptoms have improved, before psychosis i spent all my time getting high and even if i didnt end up mentally ill and just continued that things would have not been good, once it started i stopped everything, now i am almost like a normal person now that the voices are much quieter and other symptoms improved"
176047194,"I had a great time with my friend this Saturday, she is a wonderful person. We went out to breakfast and then the farmer’s market. I meeting some more friends this Saturday. I might take them downtown."

176047197,It’s hard if you see the alcohol you get the craving. Sometimes when I see some beer being sold at a shop I will want to buy it. There are definitely triggers.
176047198,Vaping is heavily taxed as well here in Australia.
176047199,"I will try to follow the guidelines, _AT_MENTION_, I am a person of faith. When it comes to belief, I do not struggle in knowing that there is good. In being a person of faith, I place the good I attempt in the hands of the almighty, the most high, a higher power, what have you will. I stray away from the thought of grandeur knowing that its good is not mine alone, it is all good that has been and can be done if we in existence will for it. In my life, during sobriety, I follow the ten commandments to the best of my ability in any situation possible during day to day life. The delusions of grandeur I have struggled with are that of being a prophet, of being messianic, yet even in those turbulent times, in my heart, I have felt that it has made me no greater than what is existence. As I continue to learn I know this good I have witnessed in seemingly insignificant acts of kindness whether through sincere word or evident truth, there is good and that for me, at times, is enough to carry on."
176047200,"I can feel my mind breaking. All this stress is getting to me. I am angry, livid, and this world? It’s just wrong. Really wrong. Like it changed. It changed, but I didn’t change. My youngest brother wants pizza, which is unheard of. My other brother actually ate some of my banana bread without complaining. My mom saw my dirty ass room and didn’t make me clean it. All of a sudden, my grandpa decided to quit being stubborn about eating and physical therapy, and he’s doing much better and has already put on some weight, my mom didn’t forget my coffee, I didn’t find any silverware in the garbage disposal, there was only one piece of trash in the sink, and my mom was hot instead of cold. This is not normal, not normal at all. This voice kept telling me that something unspecified was “all part of the game.” It was no coincidence that God in Supernatural seems to be more interested in the story, as opposed to the story’s characters. I thought that before. I said it before. They know. Oth
ers must know. To believe in a God that loves his characters, but only in the context of the story being told, like I love all of my sims, but am willing to make bad things happen to them because it’s entertaining, because it makes for a good story. So what? All hell is for fun? Do we really have a choice in the matter? You go where the creator sends you. No one knows what the fu ck is going on here. Must we kill our creator to make it all stop? Or do we let him rest and await his return. Just watch as we screw ourselves over and fu ck ourselves up. We’re all gonna starve if we don’t kill the demons, right? We’re going to destroy ourselves because we can’t stop flexing about our infantry. I bomb detonates and then that’s the end. This story ends the same way it began; with a big fu cking bang."

176047204,"just starting thinking about society and civilization. people have to work and do all this other stuff that is considered normal nowadays because enough people got together and figured they could make things better for themselves if things are a certain way. no one knows what their purpose really is or the meaning of life, i think about how every other animal but humans lives to mainly survive and reproduce etc. while we have to worry and deal with so much other stuff. i wonder what itd be like to live away from big cities and civilizations, hunt and gather for food, basically live more like the other animals and maybe how people were before things became so advanced. i think about it more and its impractical mostly because ive spent my whole life in a society where not really anybody has any true survival skills for actually being out in the wild and everything humans used to do in life has been replaced with new technology or just paying someone else to do everything for you (like how simplified 
buying food has become instead of how it would be if every step of the process had to be done yourself) laws prevent me from even fishing or hunting for food without a license, and everyone who has money claims huge pieces of land as their own property even if the land has been there long before people even found it and the people that found it and inhabited it for who knows how long had it taken from them by other people with more power. its weird i now feel like i dont belong anywhere because everything has been overly complicated and filled with distractions and the way things are i dont even know if this kind of lifestyle and society is something i really want to be apart of."

Sarcosine is rapidly degraded to glycine. en.wikipedia.org Sarcosine Sarcosine, also known as N-methylglycine, is an intermediate and byproduct in glycine synthesis and degradation.

There is also a very minor ‘dip’ on one out of about 100 slabs that he wants raising!

176047308,"Well, looking at your history of drug use, any street drugs are bad. I don’t know if you’re addicted or not but cross addiction is common with addicts. Meaning getting off one drug, and then switching to other drugs. With marijuana, it seems to be a minority of schizophrenics who can smoke it without any bad effects. You seem not to be able to handle it. You don’t want to waste a lot of time and risk a relapse by still smoking it if you know the bad effects on you. If it is not working and has a bad effect on your mental health it is pretty doubtful that it is going to change. It will probably cause the same reaction every time you smoke it. I was in the same boat and so were many other people on here. Before I got sick I smoked a lot of pot, every day in fact. And it was fun. But after I became schizophrenic it was never fun anymore. Made me psychotic but I kept smoking it thinking the next time will better. But it never got better. I’ve been clean and sober since 1990 and I don’t miss d

176047324,_AT_MENTION_ here’s a more positive poem I felt the coolness Splashing onto my leg Dripping down my arm The paddle gliding sleekly Through the calm water Tall green reeds Stand like armies of soldiers Slightly stirring in the soft breeze The ducks and geese calling to each other The beaver slapping her tail Warning of our presence Little otters playing like children Rolling and tumbling along Nature’s paradise The kayak shifts as I glide to a stop. This is my first time And as I breathe in the crisp marsh air I feel the wonder of the complete And overwhelming peace. Peace is the only word I know to describe what was in me. Silence. Humbling. Contented. Never in my 49 years Can I ever remember a time I felt so deeply in tune with nature. With the nature of me. It resonated so deeply in my soul That I felt awakened Like I woke up from a long sleep And there was a new world One of absolute tranquility. Water speaks words to me. I’ve always known that It’s my place of solitude. But flowing atop 
the surface Like I was one with it Barely creating a ripple It was like I was home at last. Peace.

I’m not sure my father accepted that. Shortly before he died and my Mom proposed he come to the city we lived in he compared himself to a pregnant woman who couldn’t travel since he had cancer. It was almost like he was saying, “Now I understand.”) There also was his infidelity. Mom made it cold for him in the bedroom as a result. Here’s a good story to describe my parents. On the official day they were to divorce my Dad was visiting from his apartment at Mom’s house fixing something. She reminded him it was the day to officially divorce and asked him if he still wanted to do it. He said, “Yes I do.” So they drove to the place they needed to go to do it. I w

176047384,Sorry for a lot of threads today. I remembered yesterday in 2011 when the pdoc asked me why I thought I was the chosen one and I said “because I’ve met so many beautiful people…in these mental hospitals and whatnot”. I think that’s an interesting answer. The doctor liked my response. I was 20 years old at the time. But then we say a lot of ugly things too… No filter I guess. And even moreso no clue how to fend for yourself. So sometimes we say the wrong things that we think will help something in our favor but it backfires because we were psychotic and stuff.
174353934,"Me personally - Olanzapine made me a zombie who slept most of the time, whereas Abilify was so activating I ended up psychotic. Keep an eye on it.

176047409,"***Trigger warning: Attempted Homicide Below When I was 12, I was having a very hard time of it. I was being bullied, I was prodromal, and my home life sucked ass. The day was NOV 7, 1994, exactly one year after my mom died from cancer. I couldn’t take it anymore. I was beyond the point of no return. The depression, the utter hopelessness left me with no options to get out how badly I was de-compensating. I had a huge verbal fight with my dad and step-mom and ran out of the house. I got to the end of the driveway and I heard a voice say “Go back and kill them. Kill 'em both. Do it now.” I said frick it and went back. I calmly grabbed my baseball bat in my room, and went hunting for said father and step-mother. I found her and started swinging for her head. I got off some glancing blows, but she largely was unharmed, all things considering. She started screaming for my dad to call the police. They locked themselves in their bedroom out of fear. I knew there were two rifles in there. I broke do
wn the door with the bat and started swinging for my dad this time. He grabbed the bat mid-swing and wrestled it from me. I was undeterred, and went to my room for an aluminum bat, and smashed every damn thing in my room. Furniture, TV, stereo, bathroom sink, everything. After a while, I got tired and set the bat down and sat on my bed. I started shaking uncontrollably. During my blind rage I didn’t feel anything. I was numb. I had no control and was just “operating” in a vacuum. Like an unseen hand was guiding me. As I rained blows on my step mother, I imagined what I wanted to see: her blood and brains splashed against the wall. Anything short of that simply would not do. I wasn’t tired, and the adrenaline took over and I was unaware of anything going on in my mind. I wasn’t thinking, I was just “operating.” Typing this has made my left hand shake recalling it."

My last roommate told me the guy is trouble but so far he has not done anything to bother me and we talk sometimes and everything’s cool. But it was kind of amusing the other day when I got home from work and he was there. We started talking about working and he told me that he is a security guard somewhere. Then he started telling me how easy it is because he goofs off and he doesn’t try to do good work, and he generally didn’t care about his job. And I was smiling and being friendly but I was thinking to myself that he is clueless and doesn’t even know how irresponsible he sounds, and he doesn’t realize how bad this all sounds to me. And I was still thinking about it when I got inside my apartment and I was fixing myself a snack. I thought, “How can someone be like that and sound like that and not even care?” And then it dawned on me 
and I answered my own question. That was exactly how I sounded when I was in my twenties. That was a long time ago because I’m 58 now. Even going back to when I was 17 and I got my first job and by the time I was 19 I had about fifteen different jobs and I didn’t care about most of them. I just wanted pot and beer money and gas for my car so I got job after job and never lasting at any of them longer then 3 months and only tried hard at about half of them. And even well into my twenties in the 1980’s after I had been diagnosed, I still switched jobs a lot though I tried my best at some of them but I was addicted to crack and it affected my job performance. It wasn’t until I got clean in 1990 when I was in my thirties that I started really taking my jobs seriously and I went into each job with the goal of doing the best I can and putting out extra effort to be a hard worker and a good employee. And that takes me up to my current job which I’ve been at for 5 years. So yeah, I’ve matured in a lot of 
ways and talking to that kid that reminds me how far I’ve come."

174353969,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Clinical Correlates of Insulin Resistance in Chronic Schizophrenia: Relationship to Negative Symptoms. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, AS _NAME_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Higher prevalence of physical comorbidity and premature mortality in persons with schizophrenia (PwS) results primarily from heightened cardiovascular and metabolic risks. The literature suggests that insulin resistance precedes the development of obesity, smoking, and use of antipsychotic medications, although these likely play a compounding role later in the course of the disorder. It is thus important to discover the clinical characteristics of PwS with high insulin resistance, as these individuals may represent an etiopathologically distinct subgroup with a distinct course and treatment needs. We conducted a cross-sectional study and compared insulin resistance between 145 PwS and 140 nonpsychiatric comparison (NC) participants, similar in age, sex, and ra
ce distribution. In addition, we examined correlates of insulin resistance in PwS. As expected, PwS had higher levels of insulin resistance [Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)] and body mass index (BMI) compared to the NC participants. HOMA-IR in the PwS was most associated with negative symptoms, BMI, and non-White race/ethnicity. The mechanistic relationships between insulin resistance and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients warrant further investigation, and future studies should examine outcomes of PwS with this cluster of physical and mental symptoms and determine how management of insulin resistance might improve health of these individuals."

176047575,The nazis euthanized the sick and the poor. Why don’t they keep doing it?
176047576,"Yes mine was spiritual, multiple voices at work but ended up wit 2, still hear at night on occasion after 4 years, started out they wanted me to atone my sins back to the devil, they definitely put the fear of God in me, I fought the devil and prayed the two weeks I was in hospital with psychosis but when I got out they had no memories of doing it, they were like friends after that but the female would have temper tantrums and scream in my head was awful, got on meds after 3-4 months got some better"
176047577,i got no clue… when you translate what they call us here it’s translated to invalids… they mean disabled people… either physical or psychological.
174353974,Schizophrenia and psychosis and bipolar etc are treatable… when they first told me I had psychosis I thought it was schiz and then they agreed… I then felt I was wrong so tried to tell them I had bipolar and looked for symptoms I thought I had but in reality I was wrong there too cos bipolar has more intense mood swings … try to move away and not think too much about the label they give you right now… let them work through this. .
176047578,"I once worked a couple times in a church kitchen and it didn’t really help me meet many people. To meet people, it’s sometimes helpful to seek out your own kind. But my dad says friends come and go anyways. You need to have family who care. If you like volunteering in the kitchen, there’s places like the homeless shelter that might need help? Our homeless shelter gives free lunch to volunteers."
176047579,"No it’s not. I’m not trying to be mean, but you can’t say for sure that you’ll never become delusional again. Your dr can discuss this with you. Ask why you need meds and for how long you’ll need them"
176047580,"Sending condolences, hope you all pass through this in one piece."
176047581,Thanks everyone for the replies. I guess that whilst no longer suicidal I still harbour a passive death wish and a cavalier disregard for my own health.
174353971,"Wikipedia says its good for cognitive symptoms. Nothing about negative symptoms. Where did you read that it acts on histamine? They only say its different than other AP because it reduces dopamine when dopamine is high and increases dopamine when dopamine is low. Its a modulator, not an antagonist. Other APs except Abilify completely block dopamine all the time."
174353975,I needed 20mg Abilify to be stable and even then I still had paranoia when watching mexican-colombian mafia series Narcos on Netflix.

176047585,"Well, last article I read suggested that all diets may actually work because they’re a placebo; your mind makes associations with food and how we feel can affect our weight. I think a way around this is you can still eat foods you like, but find alternatives. Alternatives you can feel good about eating, that is. I get fat-free milk (non-fat dry milk) or low-fat stuff and also replace sugars with sugar-free stuff that uses erythritol, stevia, or Swerve (particularly like their brown sugar). Also, replace fats with healthy fats when you can like avocado, and coconut oil over butter. I made a cake (matcha) actually with Tofu/sugar-free sweetener, matcha, alternative flours (forgot to mention those), coconut oil, and a fat free whipped topping frosting. No butter used. That way you won’t feel deprived but also can feel good about the choices you make with the foods you buy. Assuming, if you buy them/prepare them yourself. Matcha is apparently good for metabolism also. I think the key is you have to 
feel confident and good about those choices/eating the food. But if there is an underlying emotional issue, it’s pretty hard to avoid excessively/nervously/anxiously/stressfully eating for that reason alone."
176047586,Sorry you are feeling like that! I too have low energy. It sucks. How long have you been feeling like that?
176047587,I’m feeling defiant and scared At the same time There should be a word for it As I’m not alone.

176047594,I have been drinking strong coffee all day. Like 10 cups. Anyway a few of you may have seen my troubled post earlier. I was feeling really anxious before (but didn’t link it to the coffee) I took 2 l theanine tabs like an hour ago and feel tremendously more calm and able now. It’s like l theanine is the antidote to coffee
176047595,"I’m currently not diagnosed multiple doctors don’t know either, DNA is linked but doesn’t mean I would’ve had psychosis had I not smoked. Have you heard of the two-hit hypothesis? It links everything together for me. (The different hypothesis-es) Who knows if the damage can’t be repaired, maybe you can make new links in the brain so your brain regulates the Gaba and the dopamine again properly. There are cases of people recovering from sz. Also I was fine off meds for 3 years but weed triggered psychotic symptoms instantly upon use, I didn’t listen and kept doing it + other stuff then had a second one. Now it’s 2 years meds then we try again off."
176047596,I look into it thanks buddy.
176047597,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ I have a concern to discuss via PM if at all possible. Thanks!

176047606,"Had an appointment with my pdoc this morning. It’s my first appointment with her and she wants to add Vraylar. I’m scared. I’m on a decent dose of perphenazine right now and she’s worried if I stay on it too long that I’ll get bad side effects and TD since apparently I’m at high risk due to my genetic disorder. So, what do I do? She says she would want to start adding Vraylar in for at least 6-12 months before lowering the perphenazine dose. So that makes me feel a little better. But I’m still really scared. I’ve never made it more than 2 years out of the hospital, and this week marks 2 years. Help? What would you do?"

176047623,"I have negative symptoms all the time. No drive and no motivation and lack energy. My positives are just paranoia and delusions. I don’t hallucinate, but I’m addicted to caffeine, which probably doesn’t help and exeracerbates psychosis and makes the meds not work properly. I was told that by everyone who knows me. I cannot think properly like achieve anything or grow as a person or do basic things anymore. When I quit the caffeine or reduce it, I just lay in bed and sleep more. I’m pretty active on the forums. I listened to _PERSON_ about an alien race (aliens) that might have a cosmic highway of souls or consciousness traveling at light speed and then entering avatars on planet earth. He said it wouldn’t be detectable, but I think that happened to me. It sounds schizophrenic, delusional, and a positive symptom, but it may be why I’m crazy and stuff. Aliens/dreams/past lives/etc. told me they uploaded my brain to a computer in my original life and I ended up schizophrenic, but I went to 
parallel universes and keep coming back alive like endless reincarnation after 2013. Not sure if this is schizophrenic bullcrap but it feels super real to me like transhumanism/immortality. I watch a lot of TV shows (clips and trailers) on Youtube of Westworld and Lost and even Legion and Altered Carbon. Like it fits into my whole delusion of things that I’m a time traveler and went ‘interstellar’ lol. Am I crazy? Nothing really works. Maybe it was aliens (mostly) that did this to me. I feel largely ignored and that’s probably a good thing. Maybe I don’t exist really. Like the main character on Altered Carbon, I felt I was originally born on Earth and went to several parallel earths and maybe even made some money in a past life (lost it). I don’t know. I don’t remember outerspace really, but I remember there was a computer on the back of the moon, been to Mars, and experienced different histories of reality – seeing history change. I feel like I was told I was ET."
176047624,"I see my pdoc every eight weeks for 25 minutes at a time. She asks how I’ve been and what I have done since our last visit, and then she makes sure I have enough refills to last until the next appointment. Since the Zyprexa has been helping so much, we focus on accomplishments like volunteering and driving by myself. She keeps notes on all the things I can do now and she asks me if there’s anything new and if I am still managing to do all the things I could do as of our last visit. Prior to the Zyprexa, it was a broken record of paranoia and delusions that wouldn’t go away. Her focus was on quality of life and lack thereof, and tweaking my med cocktail to try to improve things. I encourage you to keep notes if you have a hard time remembering things. Sometimes that appointment time goes so fast, it’s easy to forget things. I used to keep a list of times I took my PRN med and breakthrough psychotic episodes. It helped to have it so we could maximize our talk time."
174353989,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Reduced DNA Methylation of the Oxytocin Receptor Gene Is Associated With Anhedonia-Asociality in Women With Recent-Onset Schizophrenia and Ultra-high Risk for Psychosis. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Park, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_ Park, _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_ An, Schizophrenia bulletin , Apr 2019 09 Negative symptoms are recognized as a fundamental feature of schizophrenia throughout the disease course. Epigenetic alterations in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) may be a key mechanism involved in social-emotional disturbances of schizophrenia. Here, we investigated OXTR methylation and its association with clinical and brain network connectivity phenotypes of negative symptoms, particularly anhedonia-asociality, in individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia (ROS) and at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis. Sixty-four ROS (39 women), 46 UHR (19 women), and 98 healthy individuals (52 women) participated in this study. OXTR methylation was quantified using the pyrosequ
encing method. A subset of participants (16 ROS, 23 UHR, and 33 healthy controls [HCs]) underwent a 5.5-minute resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the relationship between OXTR methylation and the striatal-_USER_ID_ network functional connectivity (FC) underlying anhedonia-asociality. Both men and women with ROS and UHR showed significantly decreased OXTR methylation compared to HCs. In women with ROS and UHR, decreased OXTR methylation showed a significant correlation with increased anhedonia-asociality. FC of the striatal-_USER_ID_ network, positively associated with the severity of anhedonia-asociality, showed an inverse correlation with OXTR methylation. This study suggests that epigenetic alterations of OXTR, which can be detected before the development of full-blown psychosis, confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and play a crucial role in the manifestation of anhedonia-asociality, particularly in women."

176047688,That year she asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I glibly said I don’t know mom rainbows. Well she died before Christmas but she had already done her shopping and wrapped the presents. It was bittersweet that year opening our gifts from her. What she got me was a massive array of prisms so I could hang them in the window and make rainbows. Over the years I’ve re-gifted many of them but I’ve kept my favorites and I’m finally in a place where I get sunlight hitting the windows. Every time of the day that the sun hits a different window I have a prism there and I get rainbows. I love it so much and I always say thank you mama.

174354014,"Answering genetics questions in one post. Your parents are likely carriers. The reason why someone becomes a carrier to a pathogenic mutation is because the other gene in the set of chromosome compensates for the mistake in the other chromosome. So the other chromosome makes the coding/protein/enzyme whatever it is, and so the other gene just sit there and do nothing. And that’s why your parents are healthy. Please see this graph. 750px-Autosomal_dominant_and_recessive.svg750×631 102 KB Yes. See above. If you have a heterozygous mutation and if the inheritance is recessive, you are a carrier and this pathogenic mutation can be dormant. A prominent example is my own genetic condition- no one knows why the gene stops working after 20+ years of working somehow okay. Some mutations end up causing defects at birth, but some live a normal life up to one’s twenties. I lived normally (with a healthy body but with a diseased mind) but my onset came at age 20, with unknown paralysis. I probably wrote ab
out the pathogenic mutations and inheritance, but no one knows how sz mutations are inherited. It is for sure mendelian inheritance. However, we don’t know. Take central core disease of the RYR1 gene for example: central core disease can be caused by heterozygous (dominant), homozygous (dominant or recessive), or compound heterozygous (recessive) inheritance. That’s two different inheritance patterns at once- I’m not sure why though, but central core disease doesn’t say “this disease has to be inherited in recessive manner ONLY”. About this: I assume genes are the same. Since genes do most of the work for us to keep our body going, this may also be why some mutations are developed later in life than congenitally. Just a hypothesis. The reason why genetic diseases develop is because the genes don’t do their ??????? job. In my case, the gene doesn’t develop its protein because the coding is either stopped or wired incorrectly. After that, the gene stops making its protein and screws up the muscl
es. This is the same concept for schizophrenia, just different genes. Also FYI: There’s a form of childhood dementia called _PERSON_’s Disease. This disease also affects the brain, eyesight etc instead of how schizophrenia affects the brain with psychosis later in life. _PERSON_’s Disease is also genetic…so I guess there are exceptions. I hope this helps! (now going back to work…)"

I had to go down to the Police Station and talk with a detective…who very nearly charged and arrested me. I wasn’t in my right mind and was misreading everything which got me in trouble.

174354033,"Yeah _AT_MENTION_, my crappy hygiene practices just makes my psoriasis worse and the torment worse but my negative symptoms get in the way and I just can’t get myself moving for weeks at a time before I do something about it. Once it gets absolutely critical and I’m at my absolute wits end only then do I get my beard clipped off and get my head shaved (that’s where my psoriasis is) and jump into the shower for a good scrub. Once all done it sure does feel good… Like tonight!"

I have work today, going to be processing some books and movies so they can be put on the shelves and checked out. My friend sent 3 of her books and my husband went through our movies, so basically I made work for myself, lol Our library won a grant for renovation! I’m excited to see what the place looks like when finished. We purchased new circulation desks the other week. They aren’t in yet, but even when they get in we won’t be using them until renovation on the book room is done. Lots of work ahead!"

There also needs to be someone on the other end all the time, which is not gonna happen because you’re not a person of importance to be spied upon (like a celebrity or something). I hope that helps.

176047852,"Looks like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is one of the precursors to glycine. So NAC probably works the same pathway as all those glyt1 (glycine transporter 1) inhibitor drugs coming out. I did a little digging and found this paper though N-acetyl cysteine treatment rescues cognitive deficits induced by mitochondrial dysfunction in G72/G30 transgenic mice - PubMed It makes me wonder if mitochondria have a role in SCZ Mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia: an evolutionary perspective - PubMed Mitochondria are involved in metabolism and energy. I know personally that if my food/glucose/insulin is off it’s much harder to cope with my SCZ symptoms. As a result, I come across as less functional when my food/glucose/insulin game is off. So I definitely believe there could be a connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and SCZ."
176047853,I’m thinking of taking haloperidol is it good at combating anxiety and psychosis at the same time???
176047854,My dad says he’ll kick me out or raise the rent sometimes too. He has depression and doesn’t get mental illness and has angry outbursts. It sounds like a good idea to try and appease him. Personally it just sounds like a big fight and not like a reason to break up. I hope things work out for you.

176047856,You need treament and I’d take that option and see how things go. I know your system is different and my psydoc wouldn’t do anything but support me. Doesn’t help you but approach them and tell them what the problem is. It’s horrible to me that you even could lose your licence simply for getting treament. I’m sure that is legally not kosher over here even and we are a weird legal society…Get the help first then see how things lie!
176047857,"This idea that your faking it seems to tie in with what pdoc told you about being stable or ‘ok’ when your really not, you may believe that she thinks your faking it too. That’s very dangerous _AT_MENTION_ I hope you can see through it! It’s just you making connections and is not reality"

I hear voices, I sometimes get intrusive thoughts or paranoia, and I have some negative symptoms like lack of initiative and fatigue. I think it has really helped me to have a daily routine. I know where I have to be and when, and what I have to do and when. My job is challenging enough that I don’t get bored, but not so challenging I become stressed. At the moment I’m working from home due to Covid-19, and I actually miss the routine of going to work."

174354060,I do really well on zyprexa. Your son is new to the meds and it takes time. It really does. First thing is recovering from positive symptoms. You worry about side effects and other things later. Getting to a good headspace is primary concern if new. I’ve tried 3 antipsychotics and zyprexa is great for me. We are all different and that is the hard part. It really comes down to time and you need probably 1 month to 6 weeks to see the fuller picture.
176047897,"That sounds good! I know it is kind of a trade off for me too. In withdrawal there is a spike in anxiety and indeed blowing up of stupid details. Maybe dont just give up too soon over this spike (unless it gets too bad). After this subsides, i still in general have more of an interest and genuine involvement in life, which has positive sides, but also negative. Being more involved also means im more easily frightened, sad, angry, etcetera, because everything matters more to me. Wishing your anxiety away though!"

174354064,"What is clozapine, and how does it work (mechanism of action)? Clozapine is an anti-psychotic medication that works by blocking receptors in the brain for several neurotransmitters (chemicals that nerves use to communicate with each other) including dopamine type 4 receptors, serotonin type 2 receptors, norepinephrine receptors, acetylcholine receptors, and histamine receptors. Unlike traditional anti-psychotic agents, such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and haloperidol (Haldol) as well as the newer anti-psychotics, risperidone (Risperdal) and olanzapine (Zyprexa), clozapine only weakly blocks dopamine type 2 receptors. Clozapine weakly reduces dopamine. It also reduces acetycholine and histamine receptors may be this feature reason for usefulness in catatonia."

174354066,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Can Cognitive Remediation in Groups Prevent Relapses?: Results of a 1-Year Follow-up Randomized Controlled Trial. DR _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Journal of nervous and mental disease, Feb 2020 12 International guidelines define relapse prevention for schizophrenia patients as a key therapeutic aim. However, approximately 80% to 90% of schizophrenia patients experience further symptom exacerbation after the first episode. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether group integrated neurocognitive therapy (INT), a cognitive remediation approach, reduces relapse rates in schizophrenia outpatients. INT was compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized controlled trial. Fifty-eight stabilized outpatients participated in the study with 32 allocated to the INT group and 26 to the TAU group. A test battery was used at baseline, posttreatment at 15 weeks, and a 1-year follow-up. Relapse rates were significantly lower in the INT condition compared with TAU during t
herapy as well as at follow-up. The relapse rate after therapy was associated with significant reductions in negative and general symptoms, improvements in functional outcome, and overall cognition. Out of these variables, negative symptoms were identified to show the strongest association with relapses after therapy. The primary outcome of this study suggests that INT can prevent relapses in schizophrenia outpatients."

My hip and lower back really hurt, making it difficult to walk. It’s too much a hassle seeing my primary care doctor."

If you don’t tell your doctor how miserable you feel your preventing your situation from improving. Next time you have an appointment coming up, write down how you feel and what you want to improve. Your doctor can’t help you feel better if he doesn’t know what’s wrong. I know it’s hard when you’re depressed, but no one else can do it for you. Please give yourself a chance!!"

174354071,"I wouldn’t exactly call it nihilism, I believe things have inherent value… I suppose I’m just not very sentimental. I’m a huge fan of _PERSON_, I have not read her book. It’s hard not to feel sorry for yourself sometimes. I’ve been reading the family forum and it has me feeling a little down. I feel very much in between schizophrenic and normal. I wasn’t raised with a lot of emotion, it’s harder for me to be caring like some people on this forum are. I do my best though, and if I’m happy I think some kindness definitely comes through. I don’t read well and can only focus on one book at a time. I could use a good recommendation, I was reading Surviving Schizophrenia , but I find it a bit dull as it basically just repeats facts and statistics I’ve already read dozens of times on the internet while researching the disease. _NAME_ and _PERSON_.

176047948,I’ve been in Assessment Treatment Units where learning disabled people get treatment. This units are only for people with intellectual disabilities and all the people in seclusion were violent or fecal smearer’s. They couldn’t be on the wards.

176047964,My parents and siblings are normal but my sister inclined towards bipolar and was once diagnosed with it some years back. But she copes without meds. My maternal grandfather had alcoholism and depression. Other than that my family are normal and I’m the only one with sza. I guess there was a lot of inactive genes passed to me (probably from my mom’s side) and activated in me when I had stressful time in my life. I was always a anxious timid person even as a child but my breakdown happened when I was only 18.

176048003,Yeah. I’m not going to have a beer at night anymore. It doesn’t help anything. I wanted it to calm me down but it doesn’t. I was drinking like 3 glasses of wine a year ago but it didn’t stop any of my symptoms so then I decided to just enjoy a beer with dinner. But if one beer interferes with meds it’s not worth it at all.

176048044,"For about ten years I rented an upper apartment in a house from family friends who belonged to my church. It was close enough to my dad yet far enough to give me some solitude as well as a place to make out/have sex with my girlfriends. The rent was reasonable but the heating cost a lot so I needed utility assistance. I worked for awhile but eventually ended up back on disability and would chauffeur my family around and get them groceries, take to hospital etc. Rent is such a money pit and there are times when being alone is just awful, but I did an okay job of keeping the place clean and uncluttered and making sure I kept up on paying bills on time,managing my checkbook, shopping and cooking, cleaning. When its all up to you, you have to come up with systems to keep everything straight… Like I used to use PC software to balance my bank accounts and I kind of learned to do filing."

176048046,It is possible but extremely rare. I’m an unmedicated SZA which is highly unrecommended and I have symptoms but I do manage. That said though most people are unable to do this. And any changes to meds should be closely supervised by a psych.

They kicked me out of their services for missing one appointment on my birthday after the therapist canceled on me when I was on my way to the appointment. So they were hypocritical and rude. I like this place I go to much much more. My dad has been volunteering there and trying to rebuild it from scratch after they were basically going out of business, and he’s been helping improve it like getting funding for rebuilding a crumbling roof etc. I really do appreciate that I have somewhere nice to go and the psychiatrist I have is really nice and professional.

It’s all shadows on the wall of _PERSON_’s cave, maybe some of us are evolving a sixth sense. I too spoke with dead people and experienced ‘unreal’ things. I got super good athletically. It was weird. I believe in some form of higher power(s) which is the norm for humanity, so it’s cool historically I guess.

174354104,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Heterogeneity and efficacy of antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia with or without treatment resistance: a _NAME_-analysis. _PERSON_, RA _PERSON_, SP _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology , Nov 25 2019 Two important clinical questions are whether there is a subtype of schizophrenia which responds differently to clozapine relative to other antipsychotics, and whether greater efficacy of clozapine is dependent on the degree of treatment-resistance. The authors address this by examining both variability and magnitude of response in patients treated with clozapine and other antipsychotics for both treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) and non-resistant schizophrenia. Double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing clozapine with other antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia were identified using five databases. Standard deviations and means of change in total, positive, and negative symp
toms were extracted. Variability ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio (CVR) were used to quantify relative variability in symptom change. Hedges' g was used to quantify mean differences. Ten TRS studies (n?=?822) and 29 non-TRS studies (n?=?2566) were _NAME_-analysed. Relative variability in change of total symptoms did not differ significantly between clozapine and other antipsychotics in TRS studies (VR?=?1.84; 95%CI, 0.85-4.02). These findings were similar with CVR, and for positive and negative symptoms. Clozapine was superior to other antipsychotics in improving total symptoms in both TRS (g?=?0.34; 95%CI, 0.13-0.56) and non-TRS (g?=?0.20; 95%CI, 0.08-0.32) studies. Furthermore, clozapine was superior in improving positive symptoms in both study groups, but not for negative symptoms. Pooled effect sizes showed no significant difference between TRS and non-TRS studies. These findings do not support a subtype of schizophrenia which responds specifically to clozapine. Clozapine is more effective th
an other antipsychotics irrespective of treatment-resistance, arguing for its use more generally in schizophrenia. PROSPERO CRD_PHONE_NO_."

I got addicted to crack and some marijuana freaked me out. I thought that everybody goes through this and I thought I was cool and perfect.

Revue canadienne de psychiatrie , May 26 2019 Nightmares are relatively common in patients experiencing psychosis but rarely assessed or treated. Nightmares may maintain persecutory delusions by portraying fears in sensory-rich detail. We tested the potential benefits of imagery-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for nightmares on nightmare severity and persecutory delusions.This assessor-blind parallel-group pilot trial randomized 24 participants with nightmares and persecutory delusions to receive CBT for nightmares delivered over 4 weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments were at 0, 4 (end of treatment), and 8 weeks (follow-up). Feasibility outcomes 
assessed therapy uptake, techniques used, satisfaction, and attrition. The primary efficacy outcome assessed nightmare severity at week 4. Analyses were intention to treat, estimating treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).All participants offered CBT completed therapy (mean [SD], 4.8 [0.6] sessions) with high satisfaction, and 20 (83%) participants completed all assessments. Compared with TAU, CBT led to large improvements in nightmares (adjusted mean difference = -7.0; 95% CI, -12.6 to -1.3; d = -1.1) and insomnia (6.3; 95% CI, 2.6 to 10.0; d = 1.4) at week 4. Gains were maintained at follow-up. Suicidal ideation was not exacerbated by CBT but remained stable to follow-up, compared with TAU, which reduced at follow-up (6.8; 95% CI, 0.3 to 3.3; d = 0.7). CBT led to reductions in paranoia (-20.8; 95% CI, -43.2 to 1.7; d = -0.6), although CIs were wide. Three serious adverse events were deemed unrelated to participation (CBT = 2, TAU = 1).CBT for nightmares is feasible and may be efficacious for 
treating nightmares and comorbid insomnia for patients with persecutory delusions. It shows promise on paranoia but potentially not on suicidal ideation."

176048171,that happened to me as well. the main page still wont load but i can come in another way. It took me a while to figure that out. A few days.
176048172,Yes I have a dog called _NAME_ moonbeam and a cat called stripesy but they weren’t really doing it for me this morning for some reason. It was a strong feeling of loneliness I think il try to get up earlier tommorrow morning that way I will meet my mom and sis before they go to work
176048173,"The thing to do is study yourself. You buy a thing and you get a nice buzz. You get the thing and you might get a buzz. Often not, and it is a disappointment. If it is not a disappointment, how long does the satisfaction last? 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes. How long until you are craving a bigger, better and updated version? “I wish I’d bought the other one” feeling. And so the cycle perpetuates itself. Always wanting! Always craving! And for what satisfaction? Brief, momentary. And the feelings of wanting more, constant and forever. It is an endless cycle of addiction and dissatisfaction. Until you realise this you won’t be free. Then you can budget properly."
174354134,Do people without schizophrenia lose motivation when on antipsychotics?
176048174,"Have you tried deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, or meditation? I do each 3x day whether I am anxious or not… my therapist recommended it."
176048175,Seroquel made me worse. It can happen. You need to talk to your psychiatrist.
176048176,It takes a lot to be a professional soccer player these days. Lots of kids play from when they are young…like 10 years old. Add to that the dedication you need. Not saying you can’t- just that it really is a huge thing to play professional sport on any level.
176048177,Good luck with the new meds
176048178,I’ve been taking it for a while.
176048179,"Well guess what, these brain cramps are gone after I upped my Risperdal from 3 to 4mg. Its a sign of psychosis, I remember having them when unmedicated. Also no more paranoia outside the house."
176048180,I love when you make a friend in a place like that. That happened to me a lot in the crisis care house. We would have stayed in touch but I up and moved to the other end of the country.
176048181,"I feel like ive experienced dementia, but things could always get worse."
176048182,Fuc*in kids two houses down can hear me when I’m inside my living room with the door and window shut. It’s insane. I mean are people just born being control freaks?
176048183,I might go on the shot. I remember coming out of inpatient and the pills giving me a moment of peace from hallucinations but gave me the shakes maybe cogentin will help with that soon after the voices persuaded me to stop the pills couple years ago I’m going thru sinister hell lol

176048187,Strong positive response. Are you doing well today?
176048188,Some Cat _PERSON_ favourites of mine
176048189,I know. It would require a long time even if I do succeed. I just don’t want to get so negative about it.
176048190,That’s good advice.
176048191,"Oh wow I did those when I was a teenager. Walls were blue, red, green, orange — very crazy stuff. Not recommended leaves you feeling kind of ‘incomplete’ or ‘not yourself’ I am VERY confident there is absolutely nothing medicinal about psilocybin."

176048198,Sometimes I do say we instead of me. Maybe I’m creating some personalities out of plain loneliness and disatisfaction with who I am as a person. Do you have this problem too?
176048199,I’m sorry that you are suffering through this _AT_MENTION_ . Hopefully things will get better for you after you see the doctor. Take care of yourself!
176048200,Are you on a new medication? Did you change doses?
176048201,I found out because of a prayer chain on Facebook for him. Can you imagine my surprise?
176048202,"i dont think its hypocritical, nobody would want to see that sort of thing from a family member, for instance if your mother or father was doing that or son or daughter would you approve? i know its her choice but i am entitled to disagree with her decision respectively, although i cant do anything i am allowed to disagree and its not shaming, I know my sis and i just didnt think she would do that, i worry about her involvement bc the guy hasnt really paid her for a while but whatever, she thinks she will get paid at some point but idk."
176048203,Get away from people. Alone time. Idk what else to say.alcohol temporary band aid.
176048204,I woke up today withought the strengh to do anything like I couldn’t go walking with my home attendent. Even though my home attendant was dying to leave the house like we did yesterday. I can’t help but feel able some days and incapable most of my days.
176048205,I asked my doctor for seroquel but it gives me such a bad sleep hangover that I can’t wake up the next morning. It helps the earlier I take it but I don’t really want to take my sleep aid at 6 pm to be honest. Also while it does help put me to sleep it does not exactly always keep me asleep it maybe helps me sleep through the night the first few times I take it and then I’m waking up regularly again. I’ve monitored my sleep using a fitbit before and every single time I go into rem sleep I wake up. Every time. I don’t know why but it explains why I always rememebr my dreams. Update: apparently it is common in narcolepsy to wake up directly from REM sleep and I have narcolepsy so that explains that mystery
174354127,I guess that makes me schizoaffective ocd PTSD depression. ????.
176048206,Sometimes friendly joking about it can relax tension and also make you feel like you weren’t the only one who did something stupid.

176048208,Hello guys. This is g00fyM0nk3y here. So atm I need help finding reliable online psychotherapy. Do any of you guys have experience with online psychotherapy and can recommend one service? I submitted for betterhelp got a response but I can’t get more details(paywall) as to whether they deal with schizo.
176048209,I like it. Looks good.
176048210,"In my experience, hospitals diagnose anyone with a vagina with BPD while in the psych ward. I wouldn’t take it too seriously."
176048211,I wasn’t asleep very long. Headache woke me up again. What are you doing?
176048212,Possibly. She doesn’t seem to be very happy… I really should start blocking it out.
176048213,"Every time I spend money, I panic that It’s to expensive and I’m going to spend myself into homelessness, that It’ll be the straw that finally snaps me and leads me into madness and poverty. Throwing away clothes too. My bad wired brain. That being said, I know you’re trying to make this Christmas extra special for your kids. More Presents don’t necessarily equal a better Christmas. I’m sure you raised them right, they’re more excited to see their mom than to get gifts. Please be careful with your spending. A child would feel horrible to see a parent financially suffer for their own pleasure. At least a good child would. Wishing you well my foliage friend"
176048214,"Righto. One missed dose can increase the chances of psychotic or manic behaviors. With prolonged use of medications under deferred treatment with new generation atypical type 2 anti-psychotics, missing a single dose has a decrease on the chances of psychotic behavior as being manic is one of the first obvious signs of missed proper dosages. Many anti-psychotics remain in the human organism from anywhere from 3 to 18 months depending on nutrition, physical activity, and of course substance abuse or lack there of. Worry not, you’ll be fine. As a participating member of this forum and it’s guidelines, I would advise you to follow medical instructions of your acting psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and/or doctor because I am not qualified to give you a medical opinion pertaining to expertise on the prescription of anti-psychotic drugs and or dosage per weight and height."
176048215,Lol! Sorry I was slow on the uptake!
176048216,Just that I give up on trying
176048217,"I would start at a lower dose and work your way up, slowly. It can be overwhelming, if you take too much."
176048218,I thought lumateperone caused minimal side effects like weight gain.
174354131,"did you know, back in the past, their were no TVs, so schizophrenic symptoms never involved hearing a TV speak to you… to them, the TV we hear speak to us was just regular people doing their day to day things… only today with TVs, we see those regular people in the TV… it’s like a schizo addiction of people, where ever their are people talking, the schizophrenia will make you think they’re talking to you… that’s why we hear the TV talking and also see people outside talking - they come from the same place; our schizo minds"
176048219,"Its a cursed cycle. I need a job to get cured and I need to get cured to get a job. Oh, _USER_ID_. There is no cure, sigh."
176048220,Yes good luck _AT_MENTION_
176048221,i Can get back my normal life if they find a cure for my sz. the bad memories and past will not affect me.
176048222,I’m trying to stay hydrated because of my loose stools. Plenty of water and Pedialyte to replenish my electrolytes.
176048223,So he purposely made me schedule it at a time only he could possibly manage to mess up.
174354132,Clozapine?
176048224,It is very scary! Cause it makes me remember things that my abuser did and its so hard not to fall into this panic that something is happening! Thank you for saying this it really helps me feel reassured. And that I’m not just being pathetic for being scared! I’m luckily staying pretty level right now it helps to vent

176048227,I saw the psychologist and I got a bit carried away with talking about ‘delusions’ because she is concerned about my sleep and we got talking about it. I am waking up at night a few times interacting with my dreams. Last night I woke up frantically searching for my car keys to escape. I am not sure if it’s hallucinations or not. I am having very real interferences with my sleep. Work was ok. I got to leave earlier to go to my appointment.
174354137,my cognition only improved with time and ‘maturity’. Before i was lazy and didn’t apply myself. I have a good iq. fear takes away some of my functioning sometimes and makes it hard to learn.
176048228,Whatever happens _AT_MENTION_ do not stoop down to his level. Do not resort to violence. Try to ignore him the best you can.
176048229,I told a psychologist or psychiatrist that I was in spiritual warfare and he lied and said I was seriously mentally ill.

176048235,Will you be unable to see him after guardianship?
176048236,"I don’t have sz. I have a severe form of depression with psychosis. Well, it’s always on the news. Plus, I’m constantly afraid that I will show my symptoms in public because it can set me as an outcast. I’m hiding myself because I’m afraid that I will be made fun of. The school can be a tight community so rumors about mental illness and psychosis can spread fast. Recently, a girl opened up about depression in an online community and people made fun of her at school. She committed suicide last week. That could also happen to me if I am not careful. I sometimes think, however, that I’m just paranoid that people will hate me."
176048237,But what about his eye? He said he surgery but those combined are scary to me. And I feel like a bad person sometimes because I do think I love him.
176048238,I see people doing weird things with their tongues. I’m gonna confront someone soon.
176048239,Yes I see a psychiatrist. And a therapist. Yes I take medication and recently requested and received an increase in my dosage. Anything else?
176048240,Hopefully your mother will be better soon.
176048241,yes very true… i could live with them if they were supportive
176048242,"I love this system of no waiting rooms. My next appointment is over Skype, and they’ll fax the prescription. Then I could get the prescription delivered if I wanted. I’m probably going to be fully off of meds in 3 months by the time my appointment rolls around though, but it’s nice to have that option."
176048244,All the _AT_MENTION_ on this forum are my enemy. The moderators will gang up on you and suspend you for ridiculous reasons. My #1 enemy is _AT_MENTION_ for harassing me.

Sorry, but ive had enough of them sticking their nose is. Dont mean to sound ungrateful - but they stress me out, and that cant be good. Im honestly well enough these days, with insight to know to ask for help if i go downhill. I really think i just dont need the jab anymore."
176048255,"For anyone searching for the right AP, I just want to say that I’m loving Zyprexa. After a week, my positives are basically gone and I’m sleeping wonderfully. I know I don’t see full effects for another week or so but this is good so far. I do have anxiety and will ask for something for that. After that I may be functioning normally for a while."
176048256,yes i will think of you when i sipping champage and smoking cigars on a sunny island not to far ahead now
176048257,"I also have complete lack of emotions. No sadness, grief, joy. I still get a bit of anger sometimes. But, I don’t want to feel sadness or grief. If I were to feel constant sadness and grief over my son’s truly grisly suicide death, I’d probably be dead by now."

I have trouble feeling insignificant today but do little things that boost me for the day. I take a walk, clean the kitchen, practice guitar for 30 minutes, read for an hour, sketch a picture, and it keeps the unbearable feeling away. Then the next day I have to do it again or suffer torment. I had a mentally ill friend tell me once I am a human being not a human doing, but, sadly, he committed suicide. I don’t work anymore but when I did I was at my happiest. There are people in the East who believe in doing very little, taoists, it is very un-intellectual philosophy like zen. They just meditate all day and take care of their gardens!"

176048260,Yeah I’m going tomorrow. Pdoc just seeing if it makes a difference. But it’s a break so looking forward to that.
176048261,"Thanks , mine has been described as ‘age related wear and tear’ self admittedly not helped by being more than a little obese.

176048266,Sorry to hear that. What a pain in the arse! This is exactly why i used to be sneaky and say i lost a script to get extras to keep indoors in the event the chemist cocked it up again. Im damn sure some chemists simply dont realise that people like us that want to stay well - rely on their meds! Hope you get it sorted.
176048267,Did you just become SZ or was the paranoia a new symptom for you?

176048271,"I’m sorry you’re feeling so bad. If you feel in danger of hurting yourself, please talk to someone or go to the ER. You’re worth so much more than you could fathom. I know it’s hard to see it though; self-loathing is an insidious beast. Is there anything you can do, in this moment, and that doesn’t involve harming yourself, to help yourself feel better? I don’t know what’s going on in your life to make you feel like this so I’m going to refrain from commenting too much on that but I subscribe to the notion that most things are fixable. Please know that we’re here for you."
176048272,"Stand if front of mirror and try to create different emotions like happy, sad, anger, depressed etc. Previously i find it hard to make as current emotions, mood does not allow to shift to new emotions very quickly."

176048274,"She said, that the result of the examination would be “contaminated” cause i drink a couple of beers daily. But i think it’s just the normal stigmatization. I you drink daily or have an diagnosis you are not treated like normal people at the hospital."
176048275,I am on Olanzapine 5mg…
176048276,"It did to me as well. In school I was able to get 100s in maths and other subjects. But the time spent Ill severely impacted my confidence. So now, I don’t think I’m dumber necessarily, but I am slow and I do need to try much harder. Keep at it, it’ll work in the long run because the brain strengthens through electrical patterns that are practiced - you’ll have to be resilient"
176048277,"The threads about sexual topics are clearly labelled as being about sexual topics. That being said, any time someone asks us to TW a topic, we do so. We have sexual abuse survivors who talk about their abuse. They should be allowed to do so, to an extent. We generally add a TW on those topics. Being triggered by any mention of genitals is a specific and above/beyond trigger. Similar to people who are triggered by dogs,or the color blue. We respect their triggers, and if someone asks us to add a TW to a specific topic, we can do that. But it is unreasonable for members to remember everyone’s very specific triggers and TW everything automatically without being asked. And the profanity filter doesnt stop you from swearing cathartically. You can write those swears and end up with loads of blocked out letters. You choose to use fancy spelling to get around the filter. Which, by the way, is clearly stated as being against the rules. We choose to moderate that one leniently, but we are technically suppo
sed to warn then suspend people who repeatedly use creative spelling to circumvent the filter. We tend to use our judgment on those cases and mistly ignore the ones that are just swears unless they are flagged, while coming down harder on people who use this method to insult and bully others. But again, this isn’t up to the mods. We were handed a set of rules and then told to enforce them. I don’t agree with all of the profanity filter. It doesn’t matter. It is my job to enforce it. This isn’t a matter of “adults can’t handle swearing.” This is a matter of “the old site got shut down because abusive trolls loved to come on daily just to mock schizophrenics and call them slurs and we don’t want that to happen again.”"
176048278,Have you been good or bad with your diet today I’ve had chocolate mousse with fresh cream How about you
176048279,"I know it’s not real now. I just ignore it. The problem is I have little control over my thought processes, and it happened again just now where a guy outside mentally told me he was going to ??????? kill me"
176048280,Yeah I’ve been there. You may need an adjustment. My sz is nothing really compared to my depression. When I’m depressed there’s no way out of the hole. It’s overwhelming. It took me a long time to get to a good med and sometimes I need to go up on it. Get some help. Often you don’t want to try doing this alone. Life is totally worth living and you deserve to do that where you feel your doing something worthwhile. Try to avoid stress…that will make symptoms way worse but please. Get in contact with your doctor.

176048306,"This guy said that one time when he was little he went downstairs for a drink of water at night. He said his mom was laying on the floor in a pool of blood, and his current step dad was hitting her and saying, “You deserve to bleed.” He said another time his step dad was pushing his sister up some steps with her arm twisted behind her back. Her arm was healing from being broken, and his sister was yelling, “It’s going to break again. My arm is going to break.” He said he was at the top of these stairs, and he kicked his stepdad as hard as he could in the face, knocking him down the stairs. He told me about how one time he was being arrested by this cop, and he said, “I turned around and kicked him in the balls harder than I have ever kicked anything.” I kind of went “Ouch!” to myself, because I used to tussle with that guy."

176048326,Went to my pdoc again yesterday and she’s glad I did better this week on 200mg quetiapine. Now she said she wants to increase it to 300mg and reduce my amisulpride from 200mg (which is my known minimum dose) to 150mg. She confirmed I have schizoaffective disorder and says I’m not likely to have borderline personality like my previous pdoc thought. She says my self harm is more linked to psychosis than abandonment issues (which I don’t really have a lot). I also had a blood test for prolactin and will see my pdoc in two weeks time again. Afterwards at pharmacy I saw she had written 200mg quetiapine instead of 300mg which I clearly heard her say. I don’t know if I misunderstood her or if she made a mistake but I’m worried because I’m lowering a med and not raising the other. Hope I’ll be fine these next two weeks!

We can’t expect people who haven’t had mental disease to understand exactly what it’s about. Instead of making the assumption to hate everyone until proven otherwise, you should do it the other way around, give people a chance to prove they are good until proven otherwise. If you meet people with negative energy you are likely to be responded in kind. However if you meet people with positive energy you give them a chance to be kind in return."
176048358,If you think that you shouldn’t be then talk with your doctor and it will go fine. See the way I see it is that the doctor are looking for a way to understand you sort of like a clear reasoning about this situation too. So if you talk to them properly they will think you are good.

Trust the doctors. Trust the process. Don’t think you’re head honcho. A mistake many szs make is they get out of control grandiose when they first experience psychosis especially.

Lately I’ve been starting with the gym on my days off and that seems to get me going for other items. I make sure the list doesn’t have too much. I normally have 3 - 5 things on it and it can include showering or ordering groceries, stuff that’s not too hard. Then when I’m done, I either lay around like a potato or feel ready piddle with other things I see around the house.

174354199,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Do thoughts have sound? Differences between thoughts and auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. _PERSON_, The Spanish journal of psychology , 2014 Cognitive theories about auditory hallucinations maintain that inner speech is erroneously interpreted as coming from an external source. Few first-hand accounts of patients' experiences have been made, so there is limited knowledge of the process through which patients distinguish their auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) from ordinary thoughts. 89 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, some experiencing acute hallucinatory symptomatology (Sz-AVHs) and some who were not (Sz-noAVHs), were assessed along with 48 individuals from the general population using the Auditory Hallucinations Assessment Questionnaire (AHAQ; _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, & _PERSON_, 2006). The Schz-AVHs group reported hearing ordinary thoughts at the same volume as their auditory hallucinations (p = .53) and spoken words (p = .89). In contrast, t
he Sz-noAVHs and general population samples reported hearing spoken words louder than their own thoughts (p = .002; p = .04). In comparison to these last two groups, the Sz-AVHs group described the sound of their thoughts as louder. These findings are consistent with the cognitive hypothesis of auditory verbal hallucinations. Confusion identifying the source of auditory hallucinations could be due, in part, to ""hearing"" one's thoughts at the same volume as auditory hallucinations and spoken words."

I have nerve injuries in my neck, right shoulder, right arm, and back as well. Amyloban 3399 has reduced the pain so much that I no longer fill my Vicodin scrip. Unexpected benefit. This was all done with medical oversight and consent.

Sure, psychosis is bad. I’ve experienced it, and been on 2 years of probation because of it. But, if you can’t sleep because of TD, how long do you think it will be before the lack of sleep pushes you to psychosis? Please talk to a doctor about this."

176048544,I sometimes do shopping too. Often I do it because I’m sitting in front of my computer and am bored. I found the best way to deal with it is to challenge myself. When I visit a site like that I try to tell myself that I’m wasting my time and that I don’t really need it. I should be doing something else. The trick often is to just get away from the computer and do something different. Also I have created a miniweb so that I don’t have acsess to most websites. It helps me because I have OCD issues with internet.

It would be good to have something that could detect people at risk, aside from the obvious that they couldget help, it would be useful to know what the changes are that result in psychosis… and In the future, EEG microstates could even inform treatment and prevention strategies for this neuropsychiatric disorder.

I quit that week. But it wasn’t all about working nights. I thought my supervisor was in on the Conspiracy against me and she had written me up. A coaching WalMart calls it. I wasn’t quite stable then though. That’s when I went on SSDI. I hope the teaching goes well.
176048559,I am on dsp but I’ve been on it except for a brief period from 2004. It was probably easier then and I’m unsure about the modern application process. Be patient.

174354230,"Dude, I think it is impossible to rate schiz with other handicaps like blindness, dementia and hiv. I’m not going to play the which is worse game. While schizophrenia can not be cured, it can be treated with the help of meds. Every year, scientists are coming up with better drugs, more effective treatments, and fewer side effects. When I was growing up, there was very little I could try. It’s taken me a while to find the right drugs, but I’m better. I have a really good doc who knows his stuff. I saw your post about mentally ill people who commit crimes. I think you should read it. https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/pn.40._PHONE_NO_ In essence, mentally ill people are more likely to be victims of crimes, rather than the perpetrators.

176048688,_AT_MENTION_ . It’s not real. Everyone here says so. You insist to continually go over the same things looking for some justification for how you think . You need medications and you need to be honest with your doctors. You certainly say things that aren’t unusual to us. Most of us have been delusional and psychotic. We have thankfully moved on from there. Living in fear isn’t good. You need to get some treatment and stop falling for those seductive thoughts.

174354258,"Before I got sza, I was very young, in my teens and early 20’s. In that time period, I was prodromal with anorexia/bulimia and extreme withdrawal and isolation. I met my husband to be in my late teens. I married him at age 20 and our only child was born a year later. I graduated from beauty school a month before our son was born. I stayed home with our baby and breastfed him for 2 years. After weaning our child, I took course prerequisites, made a GPA of 4.0, and got accepted into our state university’s college of nursing. Only one day into the program, I became acutely psychotic and stayed that way pretty much continuously over the next two years of the associate degree in nursing program. I avoided being diagnosed by a pdoc for fear of being expelled from nursing college. In spite of psychosis, I graduated with my ASN in May of 1985, I took my boards and passed. I got my first RN placement in a nursing home. I was set. So, I enrolled in the BSN program. After I passed my boards, my psychosis 
eased quite a bit. At least the extreme confusion part of the psychosis. So, as you can see, before and even during my psychosis I was a very ambitious go getter who took education and hard work seriously. Today, I have a low regard for both because my life experience has taught me that no matter how much education you have, and no matter how hard you work, you can still, and in my case, most likely will, fail. All due to sza too."

She doesn’t need to message a man on a phone or adds anyone on facebook for no reason. I just got a WhatsApp message from a person with a very pretty Asian lady. I blocked her immediately.

176048802,"If you break the law there will be consequences just like for anybody else. I agree with your teacher to a point, I think some schizophrenics get in trouble because of misunderstandings, possibly caused by their paranoia or other symptoms. But personally, I used to get in trouble with the law during my drug using days and I knew exactly what I was doing wrong."

176048805,By no means was I trying to encourage delusions.
176048806,If you pursue thinking about these conspiracies and delusions you are forfeiting your life. You will not have time to do anything constructive or selfdeveloping. You will be trapped and caught up in your own delusion while life passes you by. I have been there myself.
174354288,"There is a diagnosis for schizophrenia in remission. It would be pretty stupid to remove a sz diagnosis only because the illness is in remission, if in fact it was at one point correctly diagnosed. Let’s hope your nurse has some idea of what he or she is doing…"

176048808,"Self acceptance is a hard one. At one point I was told to accept my new place of existence, this is my new self. My nurse said to reinvent myself. That sounds exciting to some except it’s hard when you don’t have the mind to do that. I’m trying to make a new routine for myself that involves a lot of self care and writing but I’m not there yet. The future is not written yet but I will trust it will get better"

176048811,I had similar problems with my sleep about one month ago. This was fixed by adding 2.5mg of Olanzapine. So you need to report this to your Pdoc and see if there is a need for an adjustment of meds.
176048812,"Thanks for response _AT_MENTION_ , I haven’t mentioned it yet I doubt he will want to increase it past 6mg Iv a feeling it will be too much, and he’s old fashioned. It’s these whispering voices that I have now. I can’t make out what they are saying though so they’re not really affecting me too much, maybe I should save a possible increase for a more rainy day? It’s a great med for me. I have no side effects besides mild oculogyric crisis when stressed. I don’t think have gained that much weight"
176048813,"When I have heard horror stories from friends growing up, and seen how some of their parents divorces went, I am very thankful my parents decided to end on good terms. No doubt there were some hurt feelings, but they both agreed it would be better for us that they separated and remained civil, rather than stick together for us and end up being toxic to each other out of frustration. They stayed in the same city until all of us had left the nest, so to speak. They split the custody 50-50 until we were old enough to say for ourselves that some of us might prefer staying more with one parent over the other, and they never blamed the other parent for that. They never smack-talked each other, never fought in front of us, split their assets equally, and frequently invited each other and the new partners over for dinner. Never once did anything out of spite, never once did the whole “tell your mother this-and-that when she gets you on friday”. Always dropped us off in person. They don’t talk much to
day, as they live on oppsite sides of the country and have found new spouses, but they are not afraid to contact each other and put up a united front when it comes to us “children”."
174354293,"After my sz diagnosis without meds my positive symptoms create negative symptoms, I stay in bed and isolate myself from fear and paranoia of ppl."
174354295,"Hi and welcome! I have had schizophrenia for about 16 years now. My diagnosis keeps changing, but the symptoms have been the same. I haven’t had a single positive symptom in 2.5 years though. I found the right med combo for me, but it’s different for everyone, so keep a look out for what works for you. Voices tend to say the things you’re most afraid of. For example, mine were really violent. I was scared for a while that this meant I was a violent person, but my therapist said it was just an indicator of what scared me most."
176048814,Me too all of the time
176048815,Yeah im shooting milk… tmi sorry
176048816,"Thanks very much. Yes, I am very close with my neuropsych. We have known each other for 20 years, and she has walked with me through hell I decided to ask her directly for more information about her cancer. By the sounds of it, they caught it early and there is a good chance of recovery. Thank God!! It was in her breast tissue, as well as her colon. They could remove those tumours, but it’s spread to her lymph nodes, extremely early stage. I can breathe again"
174354300,He is weaning me off lithium. I’m so thankful that he listens to me. Lithium makes me so nauseated. He thinks the clozapine should stabilize my moods but we will see how that goes. I’m hopeful that this will make me feel better. I see him mid August. By then the lithium is done.
176048817,"I believe the world owes me nothing. Also, I don’t worry about things I can’t control."
176048818,Haha aw idk how to respond. Thanks for the positivity _PERSON_

176048828,"I hate drinking too, i keep trying not to but the voices keep making me"
176048829,"I remember the first time I got admitted to the psychiatric ward. They were trying to give me a shot with something and I tried to escape. I ran out the door, lost my balance and ran my head straight into a wall corner. I blacked out and the next thing I remember I was coming to myself while lying face down on the floor. Sometimes I used to wonder if I died then and that I’m in a different dimension or something. That the test goes on, my trials are not over or whatever. Now I think not though. It’s just the meds that gives the impression that reality is slightly different. It does change our personality and perspective on things. I try not to think too much about death. Sometimes I think I’m lucky to have lived as long as I have and that I shouldn’t waste my life deliberatly. Never know when it’s going to be over. But I guess we always have to plan ahead and forget about death unless it’s imminent. No use thinking about it."
176048830,yes. If you know how to use charted designs like for knitting or cross stitch you can crochet pictures.as. you go. Two dc stitches make a square. Not good at explaining
176048831,"Thanks for the advice. I used to box and can handle myself well. The fear I have is sort of a hero complex fear, that I wont be able to save my family or pets. Its accompanied by nightmares at night all ending with a loved one or multiple loved ones being murdered and me being paralyzed to stop it."
174354299,"Being quiet is a negative symptom of schizophrenia, so is social withdrawal. Be sure to tell the assessors you have sz and it affects you socially. You would not want them to get confused about it."
176048832,Congratulations on everything _AT_MENTION_
176048833,All questions for your pdoc. I take Geodon and I like it. Minimal side effects that is.
176048834,"Someone once told me that in order to quit an unhealthy addiction, I’d have to replace it with something that gets my adrenaline going. Doing burnouts in a car, riding a motorcycle, going on roller coasters, anything to replace a high that drugs once gave. I’ve realized there aren’t a whole lot of options when it comes to getting the heart thumping. Basketball used to be it, making a game winning basket- nothing felt better but covid put an end to that. Do you do anything for your adrenaline fix?"
176048835,Good job! I hope you succeed!
174354302,"Nope, I’m not a pharmacy rep. sorry if I came off as a little judgy. It is just that a lot of what you wrote reminded me of myself when I was off meds. I know seeking a logical explanation to the voices is something any rational human being would do. I think many of us here have tried to find some logic whether it be the false belief of demonic possession, telepathy, etc. Regarding the voices many of us have tried to find a way to explain their existence. I myself used to have a delusion that either I was hearing words from far away, hearing thoughts (as well as broadcasting them), or even having near exact similar thoughts with another person whether it be at the same time or throughout the period of a day or sometimes a week. The last one is still somewhat reasonably plausible. Suppose there is a day when a particular experience happened. Say Christmas, well it’s only natural people would be thinking about one or two past Christmases. That’s just an example. Anyway, as for hearing people fr
om long distances or some form of exuding brain chemical or vibration (which I myself used to loosely describe it as) in the end it does not really matter. What matters is that we hear voices and they can definitely have a negative impact on a particular person’s life. With all that being said, in the end no matter what you might present as a theory or how much a person might try to rationalize the source of the voices, in modern society we are considered mentally ill for having what are called auditory hallucinations. With that label especially the diagnosis called schizophrenia (and it’s many forms) there is a _USER_ID_; a form of prejudice if you will, against us. People uneducated in such a rare psychiatric disorder will be quick to misjudge us as violent or dangerous people. The media doesn’t help our case nor does the fact that even some medical professionals even in the psychiatric field, usually do not speak highly of we who have to suffer a mental illness. I’m sure once they’re in their per
sonal time away from work, the majority would prefer not to associate with us. I’d imagine sometimes they may speak badly about us when asked by friends and family what it feels like to work with schizophrenics. I’d like to imagine there aren’t many professionals who react that way, but the few who do, definitely do not help our battle with the _USER_ID_. Anyway, without straying too far off the topic, I’d like to offer some friendly advice. I’d suggest you refrain from trying to explain your theory without proper evidence. People here are very accepting and understanding and you’re more than welcome to share your thoughts and keep posting on these forums. In fact, I’d highly encourage that as I stated before, you remind me of myself some years ago hah. One thing I should mention however, is that even though I understand your attempt to rationalize what are known symptoms of a mental illness, encouraging people’s delusions is against the rules here. In short, if a person here believes they’r
e telepathic we’re not supposed to say, “Yes, you are.” The basis of the forum is to find support. Sometimes that includes remind people of what is collectively real (and I use that term loosely) as opposed to what the “reality” is in someone’s head i.e. delusions. It’s okay, everyone is an individual, no two people are alike, people will have a differing opinions. All that is okay, otherwise it would be boring. Sorry for the long winded post. One last thing I’d like to add, with all due respect of course, from your posts you come across as an intelligent well-mannered person who is suffering with the delusion that is telepathy. That one is hard to shake, many of us here still deal with it. Don’t worry so much about it. I know I might have been a bit too harsh early on. If there is anything else to be said, welcome to the club! You’ll fit right in. Don’t even get me started on aliens."
174354294,I am currently on abilify maintena 300mg for psychosis. Was on 400 but got put lower because i was having side affects such as insomnia and feeling tired. What I find about this medication is that I have almost no motivation to do anything and as a result I feel quite low.my creativity has taken a toll due to this and this is also making me feel low does anyone else feel this way when on this medication? I feel creative but I cant actually do anything if that makes sence. I think it has affected my attention span.
174354303,I take sertraline SSRI and it helps me a lot with my negative symptoms. I’m guessing that in some people depression expresses itself as negative symptoms.
176048836,On which dose are you?
176048837,"Yes. I doubt it. A lot of severely ill people co e here and make a lot of posts, with the same thing over and over, claiming all sorts of stuff. People tend to hallucinate people telling them things."
176048838,Sleeping in the mental hospital while listening to music?
174354298,I think I’ve found a really good therapist. One of his specialties is treating psychosis. He’s worked with schizophrenic patients in the hospital He’s also familiar with mood disorders. I’d really prefer a female but this guy seems to be familiar with dealing with psychotic patients. I may give him a call but hopefully he practices telehealth sessions.
176048839,"Someone I used to be infatuated with, about 7 years, on Facebook. He’s following someone who looks like his granddaughter. I’m glad I’m not attracted to him anymore. He never really liked me and I thought he was so great. I should have found someone a lot smarter."

176048847,I haven’t been able to think clearly for a long time. My memory is shot too
176048848,It’s a start. Hope you stick to it!
176048849,"Yes defo is terrible. But the good thing is I may not need to be on meds for life. It depends. Same for _AT_MENTION_-Cotton, because she has the same diagnosis."
176048850,"No one knows how they work. They just ‘block’ dopamine, causing us not to feel so manic all the time."

176048853,There was a terrorist attack in France and right after my “unread threads” was stuck on “666” as it’s number for a few days. It freaked me out and I made a thread about it but people said it was just a coincidence
174354308,I’m sure you are. We’re all just doing our best. Can you make an appointment with your psychiatrist about it? Maybe a med adjustment?
176048854,I used to read a lot more pre SZ. Today I don’t have the focus to read a lot. I can read short articles online.
176048855,"Hard to but sure. For me it started with thinking about my ex a lot drinking a ton and smoking a ton of weed. I started getting really angry at people while I was drinking. I had an argument with my mom and realized or so I thought I realized that she was behind a lot of things that were wrong in my life and I just started blaming everybody else. When I went off my meds that should’ve been a clue. I started to think the old thoughts about being the Messiah and things of that nature and it slowly turned into this battle with good and evil. All of my symptoms exacerbated. I started to feel much more alert and started sleeping less. I started to feel like I was the chosen one. I experienced other peoples feelings and voices intensified. I became convinced that I was correct about everything and would not listen to outside help. I found out I was homeless. I say I found out because it just sort of happened. I’m not sure what else to say it’s hard to see a relapse happening, it just happens. I sta
rted to believe demons were possessing people."
176048856,"I used to get problems around construction equipment sounds. Since moving to CA I’ve gone to a lot of bars with live music and the loud noise hasn’t really caused me to hallucinate. Either saws and drills are scarier than music or I’m just doing better lately I guess. If you can’t get into another room, noise canceling headphones might be the best option."

176048861,Had a good appt with my pdoc Making farmer sausage burgers for supper. Doesn’t require much work Watching the jets vs penguins game this evening
176048862,This post brings back soo many memories for me. When I first started hearing voices they would take on the exact voice of my neighbors and her rude teenagers. Like the sound and everything. I literally thought they’d figured out a way to have cameras in the house. I ended up leaving my apartment for six months and living in hotels. I was hurting so bad. Then I started hearing the same voices in the hotels. Then the same voices in restaurants or at work. It was only the mercy and grace of God that saved me. Finally I was encouraged to go to a hospital and explain what was happening and they admitted me.
176048863,"Yeah, he can watch her."
176048864,"Oh cool, when was it approved? I hope it means that it will get approved here in Canada soon."

My genesight test results will be in so they will have a hay day deciding what I need to be on and I got news for both of them I’m not upping my meds to sleep 20 hours a day just so he doesn’t have deal with me. Nope it ain’t happening. They can marry each other and leave my aas alone
176048867,"I’ve had sort of a weird zombie promotion since the beginning of the year. I was in the role and doing the work, but no title, not able to tell anyone I had the position officially, and no official pay increase (I had a bump to the pay packet, but not the full bump as it turns out). Got the Senior Insurance Advisor title yesterday, signed and returned the contract, and also have the 18.5% pay increase which is retroactive to Jan 1. The next paycheque willl be a bit fatter, alright. Feeling good, especially since I had a year less at the company than the required five years of experience they wanted for the new role, and I beat out other Insurance Advisors with more than twenty years in. This machine eats neurotypicals."
176048868,You’re probably right. But surely you could see how I would have very mixed feelings about the med’s.
176048869,"I’ve been on Serqouel, 600mg, now on 700mg for 4-5 years. I sleep about 12 hours a night. Other than that, I’m very functional and it takes away most of my symptoms. It’s classified as a “moderate” weight gain AP, which I think is correct. I’ve succesfully lost weight by calorie counting and excersizing. It’s a good med, the only AP that’s worked for me. The sleep sucks, I wish it was better but it is what it is. My prolactin levels are super low, so that’s a plus. I do have to take cholesterol meds because it has raised my cholestrol, but all my labs look good. I’ll probably be on it for the forseeable future, tired of trying other APs. They all have their pros and cons."

174354310,"Not related to the topic, but my dad was telling me there are a lot of good paying blue collar jobs that no-one wants to do anymore. People look down on them or refuse and only immigrants do them now. It must be our generation or several generations. It reminds me of dirty jobs TV show. I know I wouldn’t do it. I’m lazy and would take the easy road and do college. I like school. My dad was telling me Americans don’t want to do hard jobs anymore like cleaning out a boiler and more. For example, I worked retail and fast food. Now a days, kids refuse to do even fast food. They look down on it like they’re better. My brother is like that. He refused to do fast food or cook. The job market was better when he was looking than when I was. Personally, if things were different, I would have joined the military out of high school or while at community college. Probably would have got schizophrenia anyways. Probably a good thing it never worked out. I feel bad for my brother. Because of COVID-19 and t
he economy (mainly the shutdown) he cannot make more money. He’s only 22 but doesn’t have enough money to get an apartment in a safe, nice area, which is understandable, and he talks like he’s a millenial or generation Z or some crap. He’s like a lot of kids these days who have money in the bank but still live with mommy and daddy. He’s not like that – I hope. I live with mom and dad because I’m disabled. He hates school and he struggles there. I stayed at home until 21 years old. Then I was hoping to graduate college and get a job and support myself. It never happened and now I live at home as a 30 yr old doing nothing. I pay rent and food, but I still feel guilty. My dad moved out of home at 18 and joined the Navy. Kudos to him."

It’s just that porn calls to question our societal customs that portray sex as something dirty or shameful, leading to a sort of aversion or cognitive dissonance. When you think about it, porn really is just TV. Actors play characters who are meant to be more entertaining (or, in this case, arousing) than realistic, and I’m okay with that, because porn’s not meant to be educational. Watching porn to learn about sex is like watching Grey’s Anatomy for medical advice.

174354340,I smashed a very very solid coffee cup in half on my dope dealer’s head he got severe concussion but no police or hospital - could be ABH or GBH or assault that was because i was paranoid of him and thought he was laughing at me 15 years later i punched a nurse 2 x in the face they said that her tooth was wobbly that was because i thought she was asking me to hit her similar situation with a gay girl - but that was sexual violence not pure violence i thought she wanted me to get in bed with her and another i was told by voices to head butt someone but i thought that i was far too feminine to do that so i just went to kick him there were staff in the way anyway
174354338,"Initally it was just allowing my brain to reboot in a safe environment combined with meds. I also saw another zombie patient when I was there. Then one day she smiled at me and started talking to me like nothing had ever been wrong ,which shocked me. So some patients at least might just be in the middle of a reboot. My psychiatrist at the hospital claimed I turned the corner after an injection of some older AP (I was on oral abilify all the time too)."
176048991,I get bored of ppl and I feel like an alien around them. I last 15min with them before I go back to my bed.

176048994,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !! It means a lot
176048995,I miss going out for pizza how was it??
176048996,"Are they real crackheads or hallucinated crackheads, because although both are scary hallucinations are harmless. Either way ignore them and they will eventually OD"
176048997,"With what’s going on with my Mom. The stress is mounting for me. I think I may need to talk it through with someone. Although I didn’t agree with everything my last therapist did, she knows me best. I may call her up and start seeing her again. I’m under too much stress. I don’t want to unravel."

176048999,I’ve felt like that before and once it caused me to try to kill myself. I’m glad that I’m alive now though.
176049000,"I was in a therapy group. The Nurse said, “Tell me something positive about yourself” I replied with the oldie but goodie… “I’m unique…just like everybody else.” She laughed and the other patients just looked confused."
176049001,"I stopped taking antipsychotics ever since they dropped me nose first off of seroquel in december, they stopped talking to me completely. Would keppra or valpoic acid help with the brain-on-fire feeling? (*Positive/excititory sympts) I’m going to ask my GP about AEs in general so not limited to those… while begging for a new Pdoc of course."
174354343,This could also be due to scientific advancements spurred on during the Enlightenment. People started treating SZ as a medical condition as opposed to a spiritual or demonic affliction. It would be awesome if they figured out the cause during our lifetime. One mystery solved
176049002,Why are they forcing me to take injections
176049003,It is probably because you experience anxiety while working at the same time. Have you tried anti anxiety while you are working?
176049004,Thanx _AT_MENTION_. It’s More Than Nice. They Have Been Apart of My Life For Years. Keeps Me Grounded. And I Don’t End Up Disappearing into Some Endless Forest Somewhere… . … (_USER_ID_) Although Sometimes The Idea of a Rainforest Sounds Nice Also

176049006,"Omg my eating habits got absolutely dreadful for a fortnight. Like so bad that I can’t help but wonder what is going on inside my body with this much fatty sugary foods. But this week they’ve been good. Thnks hope pip will accept me but dunno… That’s gd idea to stay awake all day, I think it can def have an Influence on your mood. How’s ur eating habits atm?"
176049007,You always have very good articles. Keep’em coming!
176049008,"I mean, I didn’t pick it off of a dead bird. I found it on the ground; I used to collect them and play with them. They all had individual names, too. There were more than 100, and I had even built a sort of school for them out of paper, but my dad threw them all away because he got mad at me for playing in the water. I tried to start my collection over, but I couldn’t because I had grown attached to these feathers. I’d literally had some of them for years, but my dad didn’t care. My interests in both feather collecting and architecture didn’t survive."
176049009,And ever time I try to think that iam just a small drip in an ocean they make a big deal out of me and say all of exisnce is torturing me and hates me
176049010,oh yea… i don’t hate men
176049011,"I appreciate your thoughts, thank you. That’s exactly what I’m going to do. I’m hoping this right now will subside in a week or two. I understand there’s an element of giving something a chance. This has freaked me out though. I’ve been well (medicated) for years, and have never needed to change meds in my well state of mind."
174354341,I feel so depressed and down lately. I used to be so creative. But when they put me on this I lost it all. I hate life now I’m not good at or talented at anything else. I recently brought some creative stuff hoping that I’ll get better and I can no longer do it anymore because I feel restless and end up ruining it. I’m a low functioning individual already but with this medication it makes me even lower I’m not smart or talented at anything else and this illness has taken away the one good thing that I had to enjoy life. I hate life now I hate disappointing myself all the time with the same stuff. I want to come off of it but the doc says no I have ocologyric crisis to which they prescribed me an anticolinergenic medication for. I dont want to take it because I’m also worry about the side affects.confusion forgetfulness I’m already confused and forgetful I hate it I just want to come off. No body understands not even my family. I really want to learn crochet but I dont think I can because 
you need memory for it and I dont have that. I’m going to die alone unloved depressed worthless.untallented what they all said about me in school was true because in the end of the day I do have nothing going for me now. I want to make something of my life but I dont think I ever will. I just want someone to understand. Is anyone else in the same situation as me? On top of it all Abilify makes me spend more money on creative just to end up disappointing myself
176049012,Mad man llamas make good people
176049013,"Oh, I get it. I have had the same thing happen but more often now I get “but you seem so…um…” They are trying to avoid saying normal! And I will own that word! It’s ours and to hell with those that try using it."
176049014,"Using will only make things worse. Then, you’ll have two problems: mental illness and addiction."
174354347,"If negative symptoms is bothering you then first need to eliminate things which are causing it. Risperdal is known to worsen negative symptoms so trying alternative AP which causes less negative symptoms is the best option. I think its best to go back to our old AP ablify or similar ones like vraylar etc. Mild positive symptoms may still be there as your body get used to risperdal and withdrawal symptoms can appear but need to self control yourself without acting on it then only will this negative symptoms can be improved as if try to eliminate all positive symptoms with medication end up in worsening negative symptoms. Mild paranoia, anger, hypersexuality etc might be the expected withdrawal effects and must be prepared to face it without going out of control."
176049015,I became less good in video games since getting psychosis. My KDR went down from 1.87 to 1.28. I went from pro to slightly less than average.
176049016,"I used to drive at 200kmh on the highway when I was in psychosis. I had a deadly accident once at 200kmh during a snowstorm, car flipped twice and landed on its top. I broke the window and got out. Ppl stopped and called the cops and ambulance."
176049017,I am no conspiracy theorist and certainly not a tin head. But why is it that o get this feeling that the psychiatrists play a huge role in moderating this group? What is their intention behind this? If your concern is your patient’s health so that he never has to see you again… then you quit your shenanigans and come out in the open. My questions are legit and yet no admin or mid let alone as forum member has got the balls to answer em. _AT_MENTION_ This lady goes over the top in judging people I would like here her out about what she has to say about my previous thread. The more calm you desperately try to act the more stronger you are making my point.
176049018,"I don’t know what her PHD is in, She advertises herself as psychotherapist. I’ll try to do more research before my appointment. Maybe they have more details on her website."

176049021,Sounds very delusional.
176049022,Before my sz I was sure of having autism until I started hearing voices. I guess psychiatrists are almost always right. All 7 psychiatrists said I have sz.

176049024,"_AT_MENTION_ I only had two recent references and most places wanted three (for office work, not sure what your field is). I started volunteering two months ago and now I have the third reference I needed. Volunteering is a great way to get used to working again before you commit to a paid job. Maybe consider that and you’ll have a reference for a paid job."
176049025,"I bet it was really tough, but you did it! Good job! Let yourself rest now, you need it."
176049026,We exist to further progress our consciousness…to combat entropy and project love into others’ consciousness. The cycle of life. We must do this in the face of adversity…
176049027,"Just try to be present. It’s easier with less neuroinflammation, the critical faculties are less active, but for the most part just stay in your head and interact on autopilot. Homeostasis."
176049028,"_NAME_, mine has definitely changed. i hope for the better. how about you? _NAME_"
176049029,At work they know I am a disabled veteran (some know 100%) and they now know I was on Social Security because I had to show them my tax returns but I wouldn’t dare say what for. But if they dig into my personnel file they will see I self disclosed with a significant psychiatric disorder. People are inherently nosy and tend to gossip. I work with mostly women and they often gossip about each other. We got a stern talking to about it earlier this week. If it continues there will be disciplinary action. I just let it go in one ear and out the other and haven’t made any complaints or paid any attention to it but I am sure they talk about me too.
176049030,"I’m reading a book about _PERSON_. It’s written by a Freudian psychologist - historian and I’m not sure I believe in his viewpoint enough to read it. I think, my Freudian pdoc made me feel so small. I think I had a personality conflict with him. Anyway, I don’t really want to put adults in the position of being victims of their childhood. Adults can be made of sterner stuff."
176049031,i’ve never been floridly psychotic so idk whats it like
176049032,What meds helped you the most ?

176049036,"It’s 6:11am, and I’ve been up maybe a half hour. My arthritis is hurting as usual, and I could barely walk. I took some Tylenol and will try to go to the kitchen and make coffee."
176049037,How old are you? I’m 35 and moving back home
176049038,"Yeah I get pains and muscle aches, I used to be on Neurontin for them but now I just deal with them. Not sure if they’re related to sza, they could be. It’s half of what makes the early mornings hard before a shower."
176049039,Yeah it’s super interesting!
176049040,"No because it doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t understand my mind and why it’s acting like this. If I understood more, then maybe."
176049041,_AT_MENTION_ Because they thought I was a spy. Now they’re still not sure so they monitor me.
174354345,"Negative symptoms severity are different for everyone, you can’t compare yourself to others."
176049042,That I go about my day believing the entire world is watching me like a reality TV show and that I have dissociative amnesia numerous times a day of times that I was yelling.
176049043,Good going _AT_MENTION_ !
176049044,No. I’ve always thought they were true
176049045,I don’t think i can do this live stream fundraiser for my radio station its too much.
176049046,When I don’t work j can sleep 12-15 hours. I love it but I hate it lol…it is definitely my Clozaril. Could never sleep that many hours before
176049047,nice poem _AT_MENTION_ =)
176049048,I have several times and I can save you the effort and let you know it’s a bad idea and you will only hurt yourself and those who care about you
176049049,"My mother had schizophrenia and got it around the same time as me, age 35. I don’t think her father’s family had any. Her mother was Irish and they say they carry a gene mutation caused by starvation, when the English took their food, that causes schizophrenia."
176049050,I hope everything goes smoothly for you. All the best.
176049051,"I’d consider it. The issue is, I don’t see my insurance covering it, and I don’t see my pdoc prescribing a medication that’s that new. I still haven’t found a good med combo for myself and I’m currently trying a new one. Maybe further down the road I’d try it but for those reasons I don’t think I will when it comes out."
176049052,"I’d love to go to a movie and dinner with my family. I love Longhorn Steakhouse, and that would be nice to have."
176049053,nothing can replace the double dose of euphoria I think I was on happy pills oh wait maybe marijuana…
176049054,My Haldol only lowered anger and paranoia. I had flat emotions before I began meds.
174354350,Yes and thoughts that my neighbor’s can read my mind and are recording me.

176049056,"For those of you who are on disability, how did you find housing? I’ve been trying to apply for 811 housing for half a year now and haven’t gotten a single hit."
176049057,"I dont think i am starving myself i just feel like i have cut down a bit, my body does not need it atm, maybe if i was more active i’d need more energy from food but for now, for whatever reason my body is telling me i do not need as much. I do want to drink a bit more though, i think water and not sugary drinks all the time is essential, more essential than food, i try and drink clean water but there is so much sugar in everything and i worry about that."
176049058,"Our sz minds got out of control and we have to literally tackle them and make them listen to reason. Not an easy process as we see on this forum every day. You seem quite aware so I""m optimistic for you."
176049059,"haha. sounds interesting. I just plan on being reborn, or waking up in an alternate reality. no need to be frozen."
176049060,It’s a worthy investment in your overall health. I’m actually doing a diet. It’s one from Australia and it’s a more scientific approach. It’s called the CSIRO diet and there’s a newer version out there but the old one isn’t too bad. Good luck. Hope you pick up some healthy habits with food. I still have my moments and I’ll have the odd jam donuts. Seriously. You have to allow for the odd bits of awesomeness.
176049061,That would be a good idea.
176049062,Good luck _AT_MENTION_. Be sure to listening to her!
176049063,It happens occasionally but I am 30 y.o. I think the meds blocking dopamine do this.
176049064,"I dont know - It seems to work quite quickly for me. I am over tired tho, maybe if i halfed a pill i would get a good sleep in and feel better in the morning? I got spares - even tho im on weeklys. Maybe ill do half a pill and see how i get on…"
176049065,I have a can of Monster everyday
176049066,I wish I could just live in the present. Not dwell on the past and not worry about the future. But I do both.
176049067,"Sorry correct me if im wrong - but i do believe this thread is starting to be a bit “enabling” pandering to _AT_MENTION_-Cotton s every whim - when, im sorry, shes having a bloody paddy. She wants to start looking inwards, instead of this forum all the time to learn some bloody coping skills. And im sorry - but if that involves a bit of self-reflection and suffering - than so be it."
176049068,You sure?
176049069,"i have zero friends, and its been that way for 12 years now"
176049070,I sure hope that’s how it works. Or it’s all for nothing.
176049071,Do you eat less with a keto diet? Because carbs are 4 calories/gram and fat is 9. You will gain weight with keto diet if you eat the same amount as usually. I wouldn’t be able to eat less than what I eat now. It would have been nice if fats were 4 calories/g too and not 9 calories/g
176049072,Very good! You’ve so much talent but make some happy pics as well! Broaden your horizons and mix it up a bit. You’ve so much talent girl!
176049073,I like Lorazepam too.
174354349,without taking nap also you can see effects. nap just intensifies the effect.
176049074,I’ve believed my mother in law trying to poison my food for eight years now. Recently that she’s trying to control my mind as well. Nothing happened yet but I can’t shake it off _PERSON_ the evil spirit in my head was with me since I was about 15 (21 years ago) but only revealed his name to me five years ago
176049075,If I expose myself more to what causes me distress would that help me regain over my fear? I’m afraid of police. Tonight I watched their TV show but I’m not sure whether I feel worse and more deeply disturbed or stronger
176049076,Where do I find this info online?
176049077,not if you keep saturated levels to 10% of total daily calories according to link. Any more than that and I agree with you. I have only got a week of keto left anyway.
176049078,Some old fella whom i wont name - used to rip some right dirty ones in the bar in my boozing days. He could literally clear a pub in seconds. He got threatened of being barred if he did it again lol. It was probably all the real ale he was supping.
176049079,Cheers! Im doing ok so far. AA 3x a week. Im doing alright
176049080,is this about disability pay I hope things go well
176049081,"Fck, that was triggering. It’s okay. Have you seen the movie ‘Cube’ ? For some reason I saw the word; Room. And saw; Cube. Cube (1997) - Trailer"
176049082,"The Celebration at my clubhouse was great, loads of people got certificates and i managed to speak with my friend in front of the Audience and it went ok. afterwards we had Indian food that i helped to make, I feel like i don’t do enough but it looks like the future is promising with another video to be made about teps and a singing group starting for people with mental health problems soon, i’m hopefully going to get a tep as well making a little more money, and then there is the premiere of the recent promotional film we made. just got to keep plodding on"
176049083,I don’t seem to give myself credit for the things I can do. I just deny myself credit for things I don’t do well.
176049084,Hmm. That’s the strong stuff. Are you comfortable with supplements? I have a possible suggestion.
176049085,"Okay. Two weeks is a good time. I felt great on zyprexa. My doctor wanted to take me off after gaining 14 lbs in two weeks. I said no because of my clear thinking and less anxiety. Two weeks later when I gained more I finally agreed to stop. I want the best for you! Have you addressed being followed in therapy? Sorry, I don’t remember."
174354357,Good question for the elders. Im stable and am on the lowest dose (10 day) of abilify. _PERSON_ tryed having it lowered but doc says no. So i think that the lowest recommended dose for schizophrenia is as low as it gets. However i hope im wrong
176049086,Finding the correct dose of omega 3 is a total minefield. Anyone have any ideas?
174354351,I feel a longing feeling when I see joggers out running (I know how good that used to make me feel) I kind of feel sad about missed relationship opportunities (not just romantic) but I like to believe that it is all happening like this for a good reason it is how I make myself feel better about all of this
176049087,Hugs! _PHONE_NO_
176049088,"I mean I have seen none in nightclubs and none in stripclubs, I have been to all nightclubs and all stripclubs in my city and in a neighboring city."
176049089,"I finished Trailer Park Boys including the cartoons a couple days ago. I am waiting for new seasons of Ozark, Money Heist, Narcos, Family Guy etc"
176049090,Yes true. Do you present normal _AT_MENTION_ ? Because people can’t tell there’s something wrong with me unless a) I’m having an anxiety attack or b) i try cut off the hands or mostly c) i open my mouth and speak about whats on my mind. Is this normal?
176049091,That only can be done with work? Have you’ve tried something else? Is this a greater problem then money?
176049092,yes I have stopped paliperidone. I have no EPS side effects now. I’m better
174354355,US have better meds but some states guns are legal. If I was in the US when unmedicated I would have died.

176049095,"I did my chores!!! Everything except helping _PERSON_ with his work. He said he needed time to decompress after school, so we are going to do it at 6:30."
176049096,My friend almost found out though…
176049097,"I used to get picked up by the police and put in the hospital, in my 30’s and 40’s, a lot for the odd behavior of being very suicidal."
176049098,He is a jamaican spiritual healer… he lives in India I think… he hosts satsangs and ppl come from all over to talk with him and he gives advice about how to handle the mind…

176049100,"A big part of my sza is ""delusions of reference’, what my pdoc calls it. It was one of my first symptoms when i got diagnosed years ago and it still continues to be a main problem of mine. I try to watch my thoughts and I’ve been kinda noticing how i think everything is associated to me (not literally everything but a lot of things) and i can’t tell if im just being paranoid or if im being narcisistic somehow?? Here is an innocuous example. its kind of hard to explain this but i will try my best and hope that it makes sense. the other night i was watching a show with my girlfriend. One of the characters very briefly mentioned something in the show that i have done before (about 6 months ago, not too recent), and it was something that made me girlfriend upset when it happened…like irl. So then i was afraid that when she saw that scene she immediately associated those bad feelings towards me again (even about things ive never done) and that as we are watching the show its actually secretly s
tarted to become a narrative about our relationship or something. then in my head i think she hates me because the tv show solidified it and made her think about it. which thats just my perspective though. maybe she saw the scene and she got sad because of a different reason or maybe she didnt get any sad feeling whatsoever lol. Like, the scene im talking about was so brief though i doubt she even noticed. but i cant help to feel things like that. like if we are in the car and she plays a song ill think its about me. it feels self centered of me to do this though even though its not a conscious thing… i hope this made a shred of sense. if anyone has a thought let me know. thank you."
176049101,"I have very little hate left in me and I no longer feel I have enemies. But I did when I was younger, especially bureaucrats."
176049102,"thank you. it needs to be a good fit, including the commute. this damn anxiety!"
176049103,That sounds weird. You might have problems with your stomach like acid reflux or an obstruction of some sort? I would go talk to a doctor.
176049104,i think status can bring us far 777
176049105,"I’ll tell you the way it was with me. I’ve heard a couple of other guys say it was the same with them. When I was a preadolescent I would develop the most intense crushes on girls. One lasted three years. The others lasted a couple of years. It was a total obsession. One time I went swimming, and afterwards I was surprised to realize I hadn’t thought about this girl for thirty minutes. One guy on this site said he experienced the same thing. A guy in drug and alcohol treatment talked about it. The obsessions went away when I reached puberty. Since then I’ve only had brief infatuations. I wonder what a psychiatrist would say about these crushes."
176049106,"Life isn’t fair for 99% of people. I mean, my mom always comes home with a story, like that of a family who seemed to have everything in order, until their son got sick. I have a neuromuscular disease, and depression on top of that. Very unlucky genetics. I could pass this onto my kids, if I’m not careful. I’m in pain 24/7 and can’t walk normally. My knees don’t work. But I’m just grateful that I didn’t end up being diagnosed with ALS. I’m grateful with what I have. I’m grateful for my family and friends, a bed to sleep on, with food on the table to eat. In a way, life isn’t fair in some aspects, but in some ways life has given me a lot of things."
176049107,I’ll explain how you forget it. Suppose you are washing your hands carefully. Someone asked you something you responded instantly. After responding you are unsure if you washed your hands properly and to suppress the doubt (obsession) you wash again (compulsion). This interference or distractions makes you to forget previous event even if it occurred seconds back. If take SSRI your ability to recall previous event diminishes but your urge to redo or obsess get reduced. The reason is SSRI reduces dopamine. Less dopamine less focus or concentration thus that previous event not registered intensely this why hard to recall. Also due to low dopamine your urge to press on or focus on the urge to redo is less thus less urge to obsess or do compulsion.

If you have had 4 cups without any problems then you are probably fine taking l-theanine supplement, just start with a small dose like 100ng capsule, or even break open the capsule and take just half."
176049109,Is your wife from Thailand or Cambodia or Indonesia or Brunei or some place like that?
176049110,It’s my go-to feel good thing now. Even though I’ve got an awesome fiancée.
176049111,Welcome back _AT_MENTION_ I hope things work out for you on those meds .
176049112,"IDK, for me at first I thought nothing was wrong with me the first several months. I thought everybody else had the problems, not me. My parents took me to a shrink and we all talked. Then he had my parents step out and he told me that my parents were really worried about me and that they told him I have bad problems. I actually told the doctor that they were the ones with the problem, not me. It almost strikes me as funny now but at the time I was serious. So they dropped me back off at the group home and life went on. IDK, how it happened but one day it dawned on me that maybe everybody was right. Maybe my parents, all the doctors, the counselors, the psyche ward nurses, the people who ran the home, maybe they were all right and maybe I really was sick. And I accepted my disease. IDK how anyone else gains insight or accepts there disease but for me it was as simple as I described, it just came to me one day. And that revelation was the first step in my recovery."

176049114,"I wonder if I get a soft toilet seat, will it be better?"
176049115,I feel like the illness does more damage to IQ than the meds. But I think some meds do a lot of damage too. It’s both in my opinion. I think the meds are supposed to help and protect us. But it does slow the mind down and prune connections that lead to outside the box thinking but which could lead to severe delusions. Just my 2 cents.

They have not left me alone for a long time. May God help me tonight and prevent these people from hurting me and the ones I love."

176049134,"Today is day one! It’s official. I’m back on the weight loss thread. Starting weight 244, Goal 160. timeframe 1 year. I’m pretty excited to be back. The cigarettes are well behind me and even though I’m still using the nicotine lozenges, I’m down to the 2mg ones and I only use a few a day. I think that’s as good as it’s gonna get for now and I’m ready to get working on the weight loss. I just joined a year long program called Live Well for support in my diet and exercise goals and I’m feeling positive about the upcoming journey. I have done my intake for the program and got measured, my waist is 54.5 inches. Lot’s of room for improvement. I have my first appointment with the fitness coach on Monday and the first appointment with the nutritionist on Tuesday. I just found out about a support group that meets up once a week to discuss various topics and I think I’ll start going to that next week. I’ll be meeting with the fitness coach twice a week and I’m not sure how often I
’ll see the nutritionist but I’ll know much more after the first meeting. Anyway, I’m getting a head start on the program before seeing them just by not eating sugar and watching my calories. My sister and I have been setting aside 30 minutes in the evening for dancing and stretching to get started on setting the intention for workouts. It feels good. We’ve been eating healthy dinners and I’m starting to track my calories on MyFitnessPal. I’ll let you know when I lose some weight."

It doesnt even put me to sleep… Why such a reacton to a med, supposed to be heavy? Maybe i am too anxious still? But as i said, i have negatives too and i guess those kind of meds kill all the energy so i feel nothing on them…"
176049140,Hey everyone I have been lurking on the forum for like 1 year and was hesitant about being a member since Im not psychotic. Just had pscyhotic episodes due to depression and substance abuse. But other than that I found you guys really relatable than any other ‘normie’ than I talk to. I am introverted that lives in and values inner world more than outside maybe thats why. So Hey daydreamers!
176049141,Is your memory problem like this. For example if do some activity forget about what did before and what need to do next or unable to hold things in mind while doing activities.
174354367,I have an avoidant personality. Plus I feel like I am under surveillance
176049142,I’ve never heard of that one

I have insight that they aren’t really talking to me and its my disorde, but _PERSON_ worried about it falling into a full on delusion. My question is what is the best way to reality check until I can get ahold of my pdoc? I have to listen to the music or I won’t sleep at all. Ive been running on fumes for a week, my paranoia is up and so are my hallucinations. Hopefully a med adjustment will do the trick."

176049148,I have insane amounts of respect for people who come from that and get their lives on track and succeed despite it all. Mental healthcare workers call me strong but those are the truly strong people. Their whole world was against them and they still kicked ass.
176049149,"My doctor is slowly stopping my AP because I developed TD, and because I have been stable with no symptoms for over 3 years, he wants to see how I do without it before agreeing to switch me to something new. If you do decide to stop them, go VERY slowly. The withdrawal alone can be brutal enough to cause a relapse. I am reducing very slowly by using the liquid form of my medication. I started at 80 mg, now I am on 30 mg and still doing well. I reduce by about 2.5 mg per month. I am also being monitored VERY closely by my doctor and my partner. I am also not going without any medication at all. I am taking other behavioral meds."
176049150,They make me feel like i dont need my meds cause im faking it anyways. And im trying to stay busy so the bad thoughys dont turn into more than thoughts.

176049162,"This comes from my nursing experience and knowledge. Most of the time, SSRI’s like Escitalopram are prescribed to be taken in the morning because they are supposed to give you more up and go. However, my partner is on this medication and he takes it at night. He has the interesting experience of being more tired after taking it rather than given more pep. As for meals, it doesn’t matter if you take your medication before or after eating. Some medications required you to take them with a meal, but to my knowledge, Escitalopram doesn’t have any stipulations like this."

That really sucks. Please hold on, though. If it would be easier, you could write everything down and just give the note to your doctor. I’ve done that plenty of times when I wasn’t able to convey how bad things were. Hang in there."

I have a tendency to believe in everything and all things crazy lol and creepy lol. I really do sometimes love them and hate them at the same time. I consider myself a conspiracy theorist although I imagine some if not all of it is real. I have a tendency to become and believe what I watch even TV show characters and movies and I would even imagine cartoons…lol. Like I know I’m a nobody, poor guy with average intelligence, schizophrenia, and no power or hope or purpose or potential, but I believe in another world or life I was somehow in the Illuminati. At what rank, I don’t know and it doesn’t matter. I experience what I came to beli
eve is “consciousness transfer” mainly after I die or whatnot. I think I have a near infinite consciousness and experience time bouncing or “groundhog day” effect that goes back to mid to early 2011 and everything resets, including my mind, life, and illness, and body. It’s like the universe resets. Same thing in 2013 too. I get crazy flashbacks, _NAME_ and stuff that helps me remember and survive at the extreme cost of emotional instability and crazy mental health issues. That’s about it."

In the Summer of 1975, my parents took me to the closest Connecticut State Hospital where I was admitted rather against my will. In those days, they had TV therapy for patients. That is, if you were well enough, you sat on sofas and chairs in the day room and watched TV. Suddenly the announcer on TV turned directly to me and said, “_PERSON_ is a bad person.” That was disturbing for me, so I said to the next mental patient sitting next to me, “Did you see that?” He got testy and said, “Of course I saw that. _PERSON_ think of me anyway?” It is part of the disease. _PERSON_"

176049236,My therapist said when I’d bring it up all the time that I’m too young for my insurance to cover mammography
176049237,"Funny how hypochondria happens to so many people thought I had cancer too, for months when I was inpatient I thought my stomach had split off from my oesophagus and if I ate peanuts they ended up between my ribs"
176049238,What kind of medications are you taking _AT_MENTION_ ?
174354387,"Thank you for your constant, nonjudgmental, undeserved, pursuing, forgiving, and patient kindness. When I can, I will thank each of you individually. I’m sorry I have not reciprocated your generosity. I’ve longed to. You’ve been on my heart. I’ve immersed myself in your posts, anxiously scouring your words, aching for you. I’ve been unable to articulate responses (with few exceptions in moments of brevity). But though you did not hear from me, I am confident in the One who did, as I cried out for you and sought your welfare. I love you. Here is a glimpse of my struggles. The expected issues, such as positive and negative symptoms, are not listed, but they are indeed plaguing my mind and body. We are in debt. I can not work, though I want to. I was denied disability, and I am too incompetent to appeal. We cannot afford health insurance. My husband makes too much to receive Medicare or for my children to go on chip. I’m terrified that I have two toddlers without health insurance. I spend 
too much time on the couch. My kids need more from me. My husband needs more from me. My family and friends need more from me. My husband and my parents have tension in their relationship, straining my relationships with each of them and causing my children distress. They miss their grandparents. My husband canceled our upcoming (we were supposed to leave on Saturday) nine day vacation at my parents’ beach house. I needed that time away. My kids needed that time away. It was free. We will now spend nine days alone in our two bedroom apartment. My kids are missing Summer. I wanted to at least give them that week. I wanted them to feel fresh air and play and be outside. I wanted them to exercise. I wanted to love on them. My husband wants to make it up to us by doing day trips, but we can not afford that and the increased debt will only cause more problems. I was too unstable for intensive outpatient treatment and had to stop. My ocd remains severe without progress or recovery. My psychiatrist will want to ad
d medication. We can not afford it, and we can not afford the health insurance to pay for it. I have a volunteer gig lined up for Fridays from 9:30-5:00. I often do not go, or I leave early because of dissociating, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and lack of reason, logic, and rational thinking. Basic life skills are hard for me lately. Cooking anything, including frozen meals, is often too difficult as I can not follow the directions. I feel constant guilt. I feel guilt as a wife and Mama. I feel guilt as a daughter, sister, aunt, niece, and cousin. I feel guilt as a friend, patient, and counselee. And I feel guilt that I am not supporting you all as you do me. I am not reciprocating your kindness. It is better to give than to receive. I want to give you love. And I do through prayer. But I want to express love through support and words for you. I fall short."
174354401,I managed to hide my symptoms almost perfectly for about 15 years.
174354398,Internship. I didn’t know how to say it in english.

174354393,"I had a therapist, occupational therapist, she drove me crazy, stressed and depressed.

I was mad at her."

176049241,"This forum has the tendancy to over anaylse stuff - especially when it comes to sexuality - Just because you have an MI, that is not always the reason for having gay feelings. Some might be suppressed, whilst they are dealing with getting the mind well. People need to embrace their sexuality and enjoy it - without feeling guilty and blaming a mental illness on it. Its the _USER_ID_ in society that causes the distress - not the fact of being gay trans whatever."

176049249,"You’re different than a lot of people because you’re very kind imo. How are you with boundaries??? Boundaries are a big one. I’ve gotten a lot better with boundaries. I used to have no boundaries, and other people’s boundaries (rather than their intentions) seemed to hurt me a tad, because I would act all crazy, somebody would put up a boundary, and I’d take it personally. Really they were just protecting themselves but I was So fragile it felt they were hurting me."
174354395,I switched to Abilify Maintena from Invega Trinza. I’ve noticed that I can laugh and cry again. Hoping that the emotional numbness will decrease when the Invega leaves the system. It’s been some months since I got an Invega shot.

176049253,Living alone sucks. At least in the winter time. I guess there’s nobody to drive you crazy when you live alone tho. That is the plus. I worry about my parents dying too. Their 75 & 80 yo.
174354399,"_AT_MENTION_ Yes, schizophrenia is a pre-existing condition because it’s chronic and long-term. That said, the condition (schizophrenia) must precede whatever you’re doing (changing healthcare provider, life insurance, etc.)."
174354400,"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-09/econ-slb090519.php People with schizophrenia have often problems in understanding some common figurative expressions, such as humour, irony, and spoken metaphors. They tend to take the metaphor at its literal meaning (for example, “a leap in the dark” may imply jumping and darkness for someone with schizophrenia): it may take some time for them to arrive at an understanding of what the metaphor is meant to imply. There has been little attempt to understand why this might be so at a neurological level."
176049254,"Im so confused. I just talked to him for 4 minutes. I’m an idiot. I hate myself. Wouldn’t it be nice of something could just make you happy? So I don’t have a mood disorder I’m just sensitive to anti-depressants. wow. Guess that’s as clear as it’ll get with this…hmmm. Get me outta here. At least vitamins work better than that crap; sure it gives the effect of working but then it wears off and becomes less effective, you build a tolerance. For me it was counter-productive. I’m prob. never gonna take an anti-depressant again. Ever. I’ll stick to my herbal supplements and vitamins."
176049255,Yeah totally appeal man. I think you have a very good case
176049256,"Sometimes I am able to tell myself I’d feel better if I wasn’t so angry, but that only works some of the time."
176049257,"Yeah, _AT_MENTION_ is right, I’ve sometimes absentmindedly went right past the speaker and accidentally went right to the window and they’ve taken my order still. I think that he was wrong and that if it’s a choice between taking your order at the window or having you drive all the way through again the employee should have taken your order. It was a little unreasonable to make you drive through twice. After all, it was their error, not yours. He was either just being a dick or maybe he didn’t know his job very well and he didn’t know any better. IDK, if you should have confronted him, if it was me, it would depend on how I was feeling at the moment. I might have just chalked it up to being one of “life’s” little indignities that happens to everybody now and then and not made a fuss. Or I might have wised off back."

174354410,"Yes, but it is the truth of some peoples lives. It can get to me too but it is the people behind the suffering that means something to me. When you see the same people sharing for 8 years about their lives I don’t judge their suffering because not only have I been there myself before for many years but I know their ups and downs and details of their lives and some of what they’ve been through and there’s a human behind the screen. I’ll make the point that I’ve heard so many people say that they have been on other schizophrenic forums or other mental illness forums but this is the best, most supportive online forum for schizophrenics. I’m not saying the negativity doesn’t get to me sometimes because it does, but the good on this site far outweighs the bad. I mean how can you get mad at someone for suffering when it’s not their fault? When someone is suffering it’s extremely difficult for them to be positive. For better or worse, some people get negative because a lot of major thing
s are negative in their lives and their symptoms are out of control. But people who are delusional, suicidal and psychotic still try to help others on here. And people who are doing better and accomplishing certain good things in their lives share what works for them. Negative stuff is a reality. I’m not saying I like the negativity but I can relate to it. It gets out of hand sometimes but that’s life. I don’t know what to do about negativity here, I actually don’t know if anything needs to be done about it. I can see why you may be burned out about the negativity but you should be grateful _AT_MENTION_ that you are doing relatively better than a lot of other people. Just keep in mind the old saying, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” I assume literally every schizophrenic on here has suffered with this disease including you Gtx. I don’t know if you have ever been hospitalized but if you were on this site when you were suffering the most or in a psyche ward, how positive would you have bee
n? I’m not trying to encourage negativity I’m just trying to put things out there to think about and I’m not trying to tell you how to feel or change your mind about what you think but I’m just listing some facts. You are being honest about how you feel and many people would agree with you. But schizophrenia is not a happy experience and people need a forum like this to share how they feel about schizophrenia and their lives and they need a place to vent and be themselves and talk openly about their lives without the judgement of so-called “normies.” End of sermon. 77nick77 takes off his cool, holy, _PERSON_ hat and puts back on the dunce cap."

I mean that wholeheartedly. There’s very few people here who’d I would read long posts about.

I would avoid looking at blue light screens like your mobile and tablet one hour before bed. Do something calming like listening to the radio and solve a jiggzaw puzzle or play solitaire with cards. It may sound boring, but once I started I got amazed. It actually keeps you better occupied because you are doing something physical with your hands."

I am a member of a few organisations. I pay a yearly membership and support their beautiful work. I want to do more. The other day I cheated on my vegan diet and had pancakes (milk and egg). Octopus teacher on Netflix is good too. We betray them. They are intelligent and trust us and are killed , eaten alive etc The best thing we can do is not eat seafood and meat. That’s the best thing we can do for animals and environment. I hope I never ever eat meat ever again. I cry also at how brave and heroic activists are. I don’t agree with the ones that hate though.thats not the solution. I’m glad I cried watching seaspiracy. Good on him for making the fi
lm. Compassion and empathy. My boyfriend is vegan weekends when he is with me but it upsets me that he doesn’t seem to care. It’s just because he eats what I give him and I give him plant based. I was looking for a partner who cares and who doesn’t eat meat or seafood because they care. Not many such around perhaps though. I don’t hang out with any activist but am member of Facebook group for animals rights. Fish feel pain. Octopus are intelligent like toddlers yet are eaten alive. Pigs are smarter than dogs. I cry for them and how badly they are treated. I’m so thankful I don’t eat meat or seafood. One of the best things I ever did was going on a vegan diet. I left pretty perfect home and family to do so. Have a look at seaspiracy on Netflix. Hopefully you will stop eating seafood and meat if you haven’t already. May I improve myself and be more cruelty free. This is most important to me. I hope I find a way where I can do more. How wonderful that great things can happen. I believe in a kinder

174354450,"2 more things that may be of interest: The “spirit” that controls me has reflexes that I didn’t have. Like when it (or I) accidentally almost pushed the radio off the table it reflexively showed my tongue. Immediately after that it made faces as if it didn’t want me to find it out that it has such a reflex (the voices acted the same way). It has a habit of showing tongue in different situations, but avoids doing it (or showing any other strange behaviour) in front of others, at least recently. Another time when it dropped the toilet paper my mouth muttered “Damn it” reflexively. I never used that word. Then it also acted like I should not have heard that. Maybe my subconscious mind has been partially overwritten. My schizophrenia knows what consciousness is. It has the ability to visually highlight the vision itself (everything I currently see), and upon doing that the voices usually say something like “Yeah, that’s consciousness”. This highlighting is not just any visual effect, 
but when it does that I understand/see what consciousness (or at least the visual part of it) is."
176049395,Abilify did nothing. Nothing. Haven’t tried invega
176049396,Probably the clozapine is the cause for the high lipids. Try taking fish oil about 1 gram 3 times a day. I had high lipids on clozapine so the doc put me on fish oil as well as a statin drug. I’m off clozapine now and my lipids though still high are starting to return to normal.

I bet your professors see that. They also know that not everyone’s standards are so high."
174354459,"I feel the effects of the Abilify I just started going up and down throughout the day. I’ve been on it a week, and I know steady state isn’t achieved for two, but I don’t remember it acting like this in the past. I’m on 5 mg now, have been on 2, 10, 15, and 30 before in the past. Right now I’m also on Phenelzine, olanzapine, memantine, methylfolate, and tryptophan. I had a similar experience with Vraylar a few years back when I was on it for a week: it would kick up and “upshift”/stimulate me, then throttle back throughout the day. Did anyone else have this experience with Abilify, Rexulti, or Vraylar? Does it eventually stabilize out? _USER_ID_: The higher doses were before the phenelzine, and the 2 mg dose disinhibited me last I took it with said drug, whereas I could no longer tolerate anything above 10 mg after being on phenelzine. Drug bank says Abilify, Rexulti, and Vraylar all have their metabolism inhibited by phenelzine but that’s the only source I’ve ever seen say that. 
My experience bears it out though as 4.5 mg of Vraylar on phenelzine was overwhelmingly stimulating."

176049414,"It’s hard to tell how much my social deficits are due to ASD or due to having a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. What I can say is that unlike some here I didn’t haemorrhage friends when severe mental illness struck. That’s because I had no friends to lose. Outside of family(1F2F contact since 2017) and stepfamily there is no social interaction. Over 64 years I’ve had very, very few friends. Periodic attempts to socially interact(F2F) with others have been total failures. Even online, though things are comparatively better, I wouldn’t make anyone’s top 10 list."
176049415,Can you say why you don’t get out much ? I have the same problem and it’s because I don’t enjoy it because of mild depression. I used to love to go places several years ago.
176049416,"Because of stalkers. They find it hilarious. They are the most egocentric and stupid people. They think no one has any rights but them. They’re always doing sick disgusting things. It’s like being sexually assaulted all the time. They tell lies about women all the time, like they’re some hero. I have stalkers who call their stalking; prostitution, on the part of the victim. Then people claim people are so angry, and they’re always helping some idiot stalk people. They claim they can do perverted things to people, because they’re frauds. They’re really just morons getting revenge because they couldn’t attract anyone. They’ve made me homeless before, and claim I’m homeless because I’m trying to get attention.

176049422,Im on 60 to 80mg a day right now and the only side effect i noticed was a few times i got a bit tired when i took 40 or 60mg at once. But other times it didnt make me tired. But its not bad at all. Yeah it says 120mg is good for sz
174354453,"When I first started on Rexulti, I was grateful that I could drink as much caffeine as I want, and a little bit of alcohol, without any bad side effects. After a year and a half I have worked out that while I can, doesn’t mean I should. The alcohol and caffeine made me feel apathetic. I have severely reduced both and am having a resurgence of inspiration in life. Eliminating them completely seems to be a very difficult challenge, but I’m working on it. I guess it is something to do with dopamine, but I’m no doctor. As always, it is a work in progress."

My psy told me there is no meds yet for these symptoms. They’re called negative symptoms. If you really want to try and risk having side effects, try Abilify, my psy said its the best for negative symptoms. He was right because I hanged out with friends, drove my car and took baths everyday while on it. But I developed psychological side effects like multiple addictions. I had to stop it. It could make your meth addiction worse. btw What happened to your musical talents like rapping?"

176049462,"Whilst you can rewire aspects of the neurology of your brain, sz comes from the fact that the cells which handle the actual production of the biological matter, are incorrectly producing. This is why the pruning theory of being effect is notable; the brain isn’t electrically (that’s what neuro is to a level) matching the brains chemical orders or vice versa. This isn’t science, this is just my wording of what I’ve understood of the issue, it’s actually much much more complicated than what I’ve written. But to give you an idea. Your brain can do things but it can’t cope with things. That’s what’s happening with sz. This can heal itself (with med support) or in some cultures (changed environments and other methods of which I know nothing of). But for the most part, if the brain can’t cope it is because there’s an internal breakdown and not an external definite cause ( this is because the body is remarkably good at being functioning - this isn’t the case for sz ; hence ; it is 
a disease or disorder ) You’d be surprised, you might be living In a level of psychosis we and the next person has no idea about. Incl drs. The neuroplasticity (as correctly stated by others) is the process that’s helping to mask or hold away the symptoms — firing electrical impulses in the correct “coping” forms not in “healed” forms —/ this is why. For many, if not all. The major symptoms will return as soon as you leave the meds long enough and have trigger situations that revert to using the original faulty or fault liable dna coding in the cells. Something like that above is what I think is going on. I’ve been thinking for a long time I’m recovering. B it i realised days back I’m still very much susceptible to mind break , and the truth is, the only thing I stopped doing and what most likely caused it all was that I stopped doing the one thing many of us do all the time (you aren’t any different if I’ve understood it correctly) , that is. We actively “ignore” voices —/ we 
are somehow able to avoid listening or being receptive to the voice component of the sz disorder. This isn’t a healing, it’s only a coping. No surprises we have effects like cognitive decline that stay for significantly longer even if we appear recovered — the brain is “actually” damaged. There’s no question about that."

I think I’ve changed my view on God, for that reason.To how I feel is better for me personally. Whether or not it involves his existence or not is private though. Tbh I’d probably benefit from discussing my dad’s relationship with God so that I get a better understanding of where he is coming from.

But I’m not sure if we should be testing everyone’s genes for this problem. Gene testing is so expensive. It’s just complicated and it took me 3 years to find out my mutations. How on earth they are going to do this to people who might not be susceptible for hyperactive OPRK1 receptors? If they want to find out how OPRK1 gene affects people, they have to develop a specific test for this- perhaps a panel, like the connective tissue or neuromuscular panel."

176049565,"Have you ever experienced medical gaslighting? My guess is probably so. It happens when you’re experiencing serious symptoms, and you know something is wrong, but your doctor explains away your symptoms with something along the lines of: ""You’re too young to be this sick."" ""It’s just anxiety/depression."" ""It’s just stress."" ""Maybe you’re just obsessing about your symptoms too much."" ""Chronic pain is a normal part of being female [or any specific gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, weight, etc.]."" ""You just have a low pain tolerance."" ""There’s no need to run any imaging or lab work, I already know your results would come back normal."" ""You seem perfectly healthy to me."" When patients are repeatedly told that their symptoms are no big deal, that prevents them from finding a diagnosis, as well as the treatment, symptom management strategies, and community that come along with having a diagnosis. They can’t target their dietary and lifestyle modifica
tions to their specific disease. Patients need to know exactly what they’re up against in order to start healing. Medical gaslighting not only prevents patients from getting the medical care they need, it also makes them question their own perception of reality. It makes them wonder, “Am I making this up? Am I delusional?” Patients start to feel isolated and unworthy of any help or accommodation. If they don’t already struggle with their mental health, they will likely begin to see their mental health decline at this point. So what are the red flags of medical gaslighting to watch for? Here are some of the big patterns I’ve noticed with doctors: ~ The word JUST. Any time your serious symptoms are JUST anything: stress, anxiety, low pain tolerance… That sets off alarm bells for me. That word indicates that the doctor is minimizing symptoms. ~ Blaming your symptoms on a mental illness without actually screening for that illness or providing a referral to a psychiatrist or a therapist. If your doctor 
believes your symptoms are related to a mental illness, they should always connect you to providers who can help. ~ Dismissing your symptoms or assuming a specific diagnosis based solely on your sex, race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, sexuality, weight, or any aspect of your appearance. Some disabilities and illnesses do affect certain demographics more often than others, but doctors should never make any assumptions about your illness based on these factors alone. ~ Refusing to order any imaging or lab work without explaining why. ~ Not listening to you or not giving you a chance to ask questions. That’s the provider’s first and most important duty. Article is written by _AT_MENTION_"

176049575,? m already at antibiotic treatment but it seems not healing.
176049576,"We used to go to a fancy hotel with girls, put music, play social games, cards, video games, watch movies/tv shows, funny videos, etc, drink, order fancy food by phone and then sleep, we stayed there for 2 days. There was also a swimming pool and a jacuzzi on the rooftop, we swimmed there at night. Those were my days before my sz. Now I am forced to stay in bed all day everyday!"

176049578,I wasn’t trying to make it an abortion thing. I just want to say adoption isn’t the great alternative everyone thinks it is.
176049579,I’ve been flagged but not suspended. Yet. Give me time.
176049580,"As far as controlling the voices risperdal and invega have been the bronze standard. I still have voices and have gained a ton of weight. Otherwise I’d call it the gold standard. No other drugs have done as well. I would say Invega works better than Risperdal, but at the time the highest dose of risperdal I took was discontinued after a month’s time due to the weight gain and the lack of immediate real improvement at the time in the voices. Otherwise I lived with voices that only quit when I slept, listened to jazz, or read a book. Invega didn’t have those requirements for voice cessation but they still came back and forth. You can’t always expect perfection."
176049581,ah let’s hope they find her back huh. Maybe she went to her parents’ home?
176049582,Just because my mother said something that hurt me deeply.

176049586,"I used to be smart and a quick thinker. Now, with APs, I can’t think of things as much or as fast. It really bothers me. Not enough to stop my meds, but enough to make me miss my mind. I can’t really think my way through things anymore, and my memory is really bad. It’s like I have to grieve the loss of my mind"
176049587,"My mom’s voice is very soothing to me, I get that I’m a little more attached to her than most people my age, but it’s mostly because I came to rely on her when the voices and delusions started. She was my caretaker for the two years I was delusional before regaining my insight. I cleared up and became much more independent after the second year, and that was about a year and a half before my mom moved to CA. By the time she was ready to move I no longer needed her as a caretaker. Still, I am looking forward to living either with her or near her, because she’s so supportive and we get along so well. I plan on purchasing a used car and not relying on her much, but just enjoying her company in the future. I want to be solid enough that when she grows old and possibly needs someone to care for her that I am able to do that."
176049588,Satisfied. I’m sitting in my car drinking milk and listening to the Beatles. It sounds like you’re getting a little relief from neighbors. Good for you.

My then-wife kicked me out before a decision on it was reached, had to move in with my dad briefly, but it meant getting a job and canceling my application. I probably could’ve gotten it then, on the first try, considering the horrible mental condition I was in."

174354505,IMO its not just a side effect of the medication. It is part of the illness.
176049600,It’s actually different for everyone. Meds that work amazing for one person don’t work at all for another. You just have to find what works for you.

174354508,"Literally,the properties of the things that is called hallucinations forming both of the basic structure and functional mechanisms of the pathogen that create the symptoms of change / disorders of the mental health condition which be called sz or Verrucktheit In this meaning,all types of symptoms including delusion and paranoia are merely the end result of the functional activities of the pathogen ( hallucinations entities) which change the data concept of the personal thoughts that be treated mentally in the present time ,one by one all time of waking The actual symptoms of the sz condition are called the existential symptoms in which the person feels them internally isolated from the observations of any external observer ,while the symptoms that the external observer diagnoses in the person’s sayings and behavior which considering a secondary symptoms that forming an indicative signs that help the observer to know if a person has schizophrenia or not No matter if there is no treatment available 
for these symptoms,because the existential symptoms that the person feels them inside himself is the symptoms must be treated and get rid of it permanently regardless the symptoms that be diagnosed by the external viewer What is the evidence to prove these facts? In the case,if there is a treatment able to permanently eliminate the hallucinations (the pathogen itself of the whole condition) ,all symptoms will be permanently removed but if not available,the sz will become a long-term chronic condition,and the person will coexist with the sz and its symptoms until the end of his life It is impossible to treatment the pathogen (hallucinations) by the current treatments Like there is no sea without water , there is no schizophrenia (verrucktheit) without hallucinations !"

174354509,"I feel the same too. But then I have learned to get my priorities right. Now I seek fulfillment in lesser activities than before. In many ways, I am content to have someone look after my needs and I look forward to the day when I can stand on my own two feet. Yes, Sz has turned my world upside down."
176049607,"I think you are making a blanket statement. The mods are pretty good in expressing why a post is censored. Every post is different and will start going a certain way if taken too far. It just depends on the situation. If you have an issue speak to the mods in a PM. They are kind people. Ive been to forums that don’t have rules and people post what they want. They are harsh, vicious places that are mostly full of hate and anger. If you are really seeking support then allow that to happen, and let other people get their support that they need, too. No one is forcing you to be here. If you want support and you think you aren’t getting it then I am sorry."

I worked at the only store in town for a few years and thats where he saw me. Id love to relax and think hes not purposefully trying to get close to me but his actions say otherwise. Hes around 50 i believe and his behavior was that of those few crazy people who devote themselves to getting closer to someone not interested. He once saw me speak to a guy outside of work and (somehow got my phone number from a coworker) began texting me things like “Cant you see Im far better for you than him? hes nothing but trouble.”. it is really bizarre but him himself is bizarre considering this started when I was about 18.

174354518,"I thought Latuda and then _PERSON_ would work for me you know make me do a 180 and recover becaus I got bad negatives. But Latuda didn’t work and did more damage than good. Caplyta (Lamateperone) to be fair I only tried for 1 month and didn’t do that well. I liked some of the side effects a lot like eating at least half as much and whatever else were good side effects. My problem is I think my dreams were crashed because of TI (targeted individual, I guess) because it felt like microwaves and scalar waves attacking me while on Latuda and then Lamateperone didn’t work. If you believe in past lives, I attempted a PhD in #1 Physics PhD program in a “parallel universe” and I think I just ended up dropping out with a Masters. It comes through bleedthroughs and memories. I don’t even know how I got in. It was another life. I held onto that belief and tried hoping it would do me some good. My life feels ?????? and unfair like I’m being unfairly screwed with. Can’t do ???? just dealing with 
it. I think these meds would have worked on me if outside factors and influences weren’t messing with my healing process and recovery. I don’t put a lot of weight into Clozaril at all. But I didn’t have a good doctor when I was prescribed it. Vraylar is the only medication that makes me hate and not want to go to the hospital. Plus, I don’t need to. I went from an average of 2+ hospitalizations a year to practically none since Vraylar. I have messed with the dosage and quit several times, I chain smoke, and drink 10 energy drinks, so I’m at 9 mg a day at night. Biggest side effect with Vraylar is a little restlessness which is worsened by caffeine and insomnia. I was lucky I got through the insomnia. I can now sleep at night. Ideally, I want to increase my topamax or double it even and then get back on Caplyta or do half and half with Vraylar. I’m tired of being fat and I want to do some learning and have better sexual performance."

But whether or not your child develops a mental illness or developmental disorder, I think you are better equipped to handle it than most. You can teach them coping skills from a young age so they struggle less than you did."
174354520,"Uh, it’s a schizophrenic support forum. We get some of what you’re talking about and we post links to rock videos and stuff but not only is political stuff boring but we can’t separate some facts from delusions and while there’s enough intelligent people on here with intelligent opinions when we get stuff like you’re saying it often crosses the line into delusional thinking."

Then soon I thought another wouldn’t. Then another. Pretty soon I had faith that many men were not abusers. I tell you this to point out that it all starts with that leap of faith. That’s what you’re missing. Faith. Believe that someone is real. Take that leap of faith that someone is not an actor an it will unravel. Believe in anyone.

And if you want to pretend to be another gender on the internet, that’s another option. I did that on a game once lol. Got a lot of attention I didn’t really want."

What if it’s wrong diagnosis. But at the same time no matter which diagnosis i would get, I still could not belive i have any diagnosis. I feel like there is no diagnosis, just reasons. If that makes any sense? How do you know you have your diagnosis?"

176049683,"When I was in my 20’s, even my 30’s, I had aspirations. I ended up feeling crushed. Oh, I had the intelligence, even the ambition, but then I’d have a psychotic break and be back to less than nothing. So…I spent 20 + years depressed and discouraged doing janitorial work(i.e. cleaning toilets)and watching my dreams disappear. Then I realized, someone has to clean the toilets, so why not me? And many mentally ill people are unable to work a job, so I had to get off the pity pot and just do the best I could. And that’s the real bottom line: We just do the best we can. Some days are better than others. Some days I utterly “fail” but in the midst of that, I still did the best I could. And I’m not depressed anymore. Nutcase"

176049685,The Empire fixes the design flaw in their Death Stars and an attack by the rebels is a complete failure and all the rebels are killed. The subjects of the Empire tremble on what will come next. But to their surprise Emperor _PERSON_ is a capable leader who brings peace and prosperity to his subjects and few complaints occur. As it turned out the rebels and their Jedis were the evil ones and the destruction of planets was just divine justice of the Empire.

176049690,I was homeless and slept under a bridge for two weeks until a spit opened up in the local shelter. Nothing… no amount of being ignored by my husband or kids can compare to how alone I actually was when I was homeless and lying awake too scared to sleep for days which just made my sz worse. If you’ve never actually been homeless but say you feel that way then you need to take a serious look at what is making you feel that way and fix it. Might I recommend saying YOUR thoughts to one person more per day than you expect to. YOUR thoughts are the only ‘thoughts’ than count to anyone but you so ignore what you know to not be real to the best of your abilities and make an effort to share yourself with one extra person a day. Maybe you feel that way because you like many sz people are too isolated. You dont have enough external stimulation so your body feels like it should be anywhere but sitting in the house watching tv. Maybe I’m wrong
176049691,Overmedication is always bad for u ;(
176049692,Wow. That’s quite a story. Thanks for sharing.
174354535,"Today was a weak day me. I couldn’t exercise. I spent all day writing on an Israeli general purpose forum on FXP website. I have intrusive thoughts greatly improved, and sleep significantly improved. One of the problems I have is that my disability makes it difficult for me to mix with people who are not my parents. I essentially “look bad” by standards of normal people. The last family gathering,which was held 3 days ago, it was successful for me, but it was so partially because I said I hope to play tennis and participate in chess competitions, things that are theoretically possible but they are sort of a best case scenario( One thing I do have in my bag though is aerobic exercise)."
174354538,"Well, my mother endured abuse of being illegitimate. Her mother’s favorite was her twin brother. He tried to assault her and she hated him. Then chose men who didn’t care enough. You may have health problems, that make things more stressful for you."
176049693,I think stress can exacerbate the symptoms of _PERSON_. I don’t think it’s a cause…it just brings it out.
176049694,"I go through periods of time where I dream. I even take a medicine for it when it gets too bad. Most of my dreams are of losing the kids, physically not being able to get to them or something else to do with the kids being in danger.

176049702,The last explanation I got was that it was a result of underdeveloped banking systems. Pretty much everyone here switched to cards over three decades ago. I don’t think checks are an accepted form of payment anymore. And most banks don’t allow you to make deposits or payments any way except online and through apps (except in some very few centralized locations). That angered some of the elderly people here. But it was a waste of resources for the banks.

But this young woman I’ve seen around for a couple of years walked up to me and asked if she could use it. Normally I would say “no” but I needed a break so I said sure and walked out. Then I said as she walked in, “Knock yourself out”. It’s just a stupid expression and I was just trying to be funny and I really couldn’t tell how she took it. After she left I was wondering if it bothered her. She might have just shrugged it off as harmless. So weigh-in if you want. Women or men, what’s your opinion? Was it rude? Harmless? Funny?

It usually takes about 10 seconds or so for me to calm down completely after thinking that thought. My own philosophy is that sometimes feeling like a victim and getting angry because of it is just cloaked perpetration. Feeling like a victim is sometimes not being the victim, but instead being the perpetrator and not realising it. Sometimes our unconscious motivations are a tad nefarious."

I’m not happy about taking meds to maintain function but I’m glad I can function. That is the thing.

176049786,"One bit of advice I have is that if you have the insurance/funds for it, agree to any tests they want to run. Odds are, they wouldn’t be suggesting the test if they didn’t think it would help. And don’t be afraid of meds if that is what they suggest. Plenty of us have taken them, sometimes for decades, without issues. And if one med doesn’t work well, try another. They are all different."

176049798,"So the latest news, in order for me to be in the marines. My voices gov has to get married with some other voices gov and then they are going to move along with being a complete and sane gov."
176049799,Freshly cooked shell on shrimps
176049800,I have one - try and finish reading “Lolita”
176049801,When I heard voices they sounded external to me. I had some tactile hallucinations because I believed I had implants.
176049802,"I had very low energy. Often not enough to even cook a meal or do laundry or get out of bed. Since i changed my diet i have enough energy again to get through the day. Only in the evening i am still tired. Sometimes too tired to do much. And i have issues waking up early, maybe because of meds or my habit to stay up a bit late."
174354558,I take 300mg clozapine and have no problem
176049803,"If You Are Able to Do it _AT_MENTION_, Keep Up The Pace With Those Who Are Positive in Your Ember…, Not Too Much…, But Hold Tight to The Connections And Understanding From Those Who Are Willing to Be Apart of You And Your Struggles…, With No Judgement And Pushing (from them)…, And Jus Do Your Best… . …"
176049804,"Hmm… I always joke about Sz Admin living in Vegas and snorting Sarcosine. But perhaps soon, there really will be an inhale version of such supplements."
176049805,Lol. Thank you for that.
176049806,I think you did the right thing. Coffee is addictive and may not be good for your anxiety.
176049807,"Great, cya. 1555"
176049808,"I can relate to this. I think people are scared of me sometimes. So silly, but communication is really important."
176049809,"Yes, ashamed of it and of what I did while drunk. Its the past, now I don’t drink at all as it gives me headaches while on meds."
176049810,Who says it’s delusional? It’s my belief
176049811,"I think they should first look well at the cause. That makes a huge difference in how to treat it. Perhaps an open door, but it is important and docs are quite eager to go after the symptoms instead of the cause. I was incredibly tired as well and being forced to be very physically active actually improved things. Lowering meds as well, but be careful if that is an option. Im seeking to improve diet as a next step."
176049812,Seeing myself in photos before I got hit with this God awful illness makes me sad as well.
176049813,Like you reap what you sow! _AT_MENTION_
174354566,I’ve never had sleep problems.
174354571,every man and woman for them selfs and god for us all
176049814,Not to be depressing…But what do you think you would have done if you never got psychosis? I’m just reminiscing… I think I would have eventually joined peace corps…
176049815,"I’ve had around 4 breaks. However, since starting on my medication, i’ve been stable for well over a year now."
176049817,Nice _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ likes contributors Thank you.
176049818,"I try to accept them, but I feel a lot of my delusions about angels can’t be proven until I die. I always have the thought “maybe they’re just being quiet”, “maybe it was real”, I don’t know if I’ll ever truly be free of that. I do agree with you in accepting that they are a part of me, an event that happened. I believe psychosis can cause PTSD, making recovering from an episode that much harder to get over. But something I do know is that we can’t give up trying to overcome the illness, can’t let it win. I don’t want to go back there"
176049819,So you no longer take it? How come?
174354568,"Firstly I would like to apologise to anyone who thought that I was being abusive to them yesterday. I wasn’t, I was just ranting about the situation, not yelling at those who commented. I know that this bizarre, but I used to be “The Light”, but it just doesn’t work. I tried another way…I failed. I have traveled every road, as every being, and this is the one upon which I chose to “flow”. I came close…But now I go. I was diagnosed as “Bi-Polar Schizophrenic”, because I made the mistake of letting people know. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BI-POLAR about me!!! It is a 100% misdiagnosis!!! As for Schizophrenia…You suffer, I don’t. It’s just what one gets for telling the truth in a world gone mad. 20,000 plus physicists or those interested in physics, have read my material, and failed even to find a single flaw! And yet, here I sit. There are no “GODS”. All beings are EQUAL! The ONLY BEING worthy of being looked upon as a god is a truly just being. The truly just have ABSOL
UTELY NO INTEREST IN BEING GODS!!! I know you wont believe me, par for the course…But this is a block universe and we’ve all already made all of our choices…Have I lost? Or is there something that I don’t know? youtub(DOT)com/watch?v=0afgQSofn4U youtube(DOT)com/watch?v=xCorJG9mubk Which?"
176049820,Thanks! Just noticed I’m not happy with how the chin turned out so… Tadahhh… IMG_20210403_2034511462×1658 359 KB
176049821,"_AT_MENTION_ I think you’re insightful, and that is very attractive too. _AT_MENTION_ If the world was bi or even pan, I do think the world would a more harmonious world."
176049822,I take 5ml/250mg monthly. It works
176049823,Do you take anything for anxiety ?
176049824,No that was wrong. But I look to that sometimes and wonder can’t they branch out? You know like Nicoderm CQ or something. Business is my most comfortable thing to talk about. I didn’t realize Facebook was charging. How on earth are they able to enforce that… bc can’t anyone message anyone? I guess they draw boundaries
176049825,"I came to that conclusion due to severe insomnia, and voices that would not go away along with the fact I had failed at everything i had tried to do including 2 attempts to work as a security guard."
176049826,2017? I think 2017.
176049827,"By a primary doctor, not psychiatrist. Im not going to get into a debate, I am just strongly recommending to talk to ones pdoc about this drug. Im not claiming to be an expert on it, but I am recommending it needs an experts opiniom. _USER_ID_: I just want to be clear, Im not saying anything about taking it or not, _PERSON_ just recommending another opinion on it from a doctor who specializes in mental health and is up to date on the research."
174354570,I’m Schizophrenic. My psychosis was like dropping acid while riding a roller coaster naked during a psychedelic hailstorm.
176049828,I want to see it!!! The exact words ‘what we do in the shadows’ is straight out of my inner monologue.
176049829,Haha…I pick that one over both of mine! Nice!
176049830,"Thanks for that, FireMonkey. The author’s website is interesting. Especially the profile page He is very well written. Are you him? Or if not - has he got some relationship to mental illness? i’d be interested in understanding this."
176049831,my weight stayed the same. I weight myself every once in a while and it’s stable at 80kg
176049832,The meds help the negatives then?
176049833,Sorry daze but if my mom was avoidant of giving out information in fear of me blaming her that would make me only blame her more. Honesty is the way to go. My mom Hasn’t been 100% honest always. But she’s been fairly honest. So now I don’t blame her so much. Because she’s helped me recover/give me insight through her honesty and stories of me when I was younger.
176049834,"I think your doctor might have some experience in that department, maybe there is some data behind violence and psychosis but I believe the general tendency is for us to be slightly below the norm when it comes to violence. In your case you might actually be revving yourself up to do stuff on delusions. Which would suck, for instance I was paranoid that people talked about me and it would make me paranoid…for you maybe that would make you angry. That’s kind of where you would call it psychosis and not just blame it on teen angst."
176049835,"Some experiences somebody please? I am still on the 7,5 mgs. For the moments, its ok. I have some moments where it gets painful, but it goes away… Maybe i’ll end up by getting used to this. I got the idea already, that the life is a suffering… And mostly for us,szs, so I should try to beat this with some other ways, not always looking to be ‘‘saved’’ by tough meds…"
176049836,"For the record, if your response to being told to follow the rules is “f off”, you’ll get a time out. Not for differing views."
176049837,Maybe but sometimes it feels so real

Although preliminary studies have suggested that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is effective for some clusters of symptoms, the clinical benefits for negative symptoms are unclear.To determine the efficacy and safety of tDCS vs sham as an add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia and predominant negative symptoms.The double-blind Schizophrenia Treatment With Electric Transcranial Stimulation (STARTS) randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 2014 to March 2018 in 2 outpatient clinics in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Patients with schizophrenia with stable negative and posi
tive symptoms and a minimum score of 20 points in the negative symptoms subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were included.Ten sessions of tDCS performed twice a day for 5 days or a sham procedure. The anode and the cathode were positioned over the left prefrontal cortex and the left temporoparietal junction, respectively.Change in the PANSS negative symptoms subscale score at week 6 was the primary outcome. Patients were followed-up for an additional 6 weeks.Of the 100 included patients, 20 (20.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 35.3 (9.3) years. A total of 95 patients (95.0%) finished the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients receiving active tDCS showed a significantly greater improvement in PANSS score compared with those receiving the sham procedure (difference, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.51-3.79; number needed to treat, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.12-6.99; P?"
176049838,Have you ever seen _PERSON_ book the secret? Ive learned about all kinds of stock and you mostly gotta research the companies balance sheets. When I think about doing it something pinches my eyes down or zaps my brain
176049839,"I have zero fashion sence and tend not to follow the trends relgiiously. If there is something I like, I like it. It has to be comfortable."
176049840,nice i can go to stores fine but i cant be around to many people or talk to anyone because of my social anxiety.
176049841,"So glad I was able to give her good news. just told her honestly I’ve done this before and I eventually go back, how to make it permanent? We both excentuated the stablity right now, my job, my house, somewhat _NAME_, my mental illness, etc. It matters double right now during this pandemic. She said it may sound cliche, but use the AA motto, One day at a time. My daughter says that too. She agreed to also use my good physical health now as incentive to not pop a top again. appt. again in 4 weeks, hopefully in person."
176049842,"True, I believe or I think I believe. I’ll level with you: as far as I can tell, what I’m doing with this “existential situationism” of mine is visiting _PERSON_’ philosophical garden and re-run his most famous thought-experiment and adding some variables to it. Nothing more. If I am truly alone in the universe, and other people are mere projections of myself, it follows that I am, in a very real sense, the first person to have ever posed these questions. As a conclusion, perhaps more rational than reasonable, I would posit my right not to forfeit an answer to the great, supposedly unanswerable questions. Perhaps I might be able to talk myself out of this universe, although probably not. The fight must continue. As you see, more of an existential adventure tinged by a psychotic style of thinking than a full-blown psychosis."
176049843,"I think we really are in the matrix I’ve had some surreal coincidences that makes me think we are! I know some people will call this a delusion and that’s all good I wish it was… This illness really opens the mind and makes us think differently matrix, _NAME_ show you decide…"
176049844,"I was a textbook paranoid schizophrenic for two solid years. Totally out of my mind. I’m a lot better these days, but I cannot deny that I went through all the symptoms in the DSM. Therefore I’m never going to argue about my diagnosis. As far as I’m concerned, I’m a partially recovered schizoaffective individual."
176049845,What was good about that video was that the man was very different from the media friendly autistic ‘influencers’ on Youtube. I struggle to identify with the vast majority of them. I think even if I was 35 years younger I’d still struggle to do so.
176049846,I’m so scared for my life. The whole country attention is on me and it’s so scary. Everyone is waiting on me to die. I live like I’m in a scary movie everyday. I just want my peace of mind back and to find this camera so that I can go on with my life and not be in fear everyday. I am so afraid. I’m afraid for my life. I’m surprised the government and people in office will allow something like this to happen. Is it just to keep attention off of _PERSON_. Idk. I dont want to accuse people but I’m just trying to make sense of this. I’m tired and I’m scared. Help.
176049847,I used to tell my therapist I was a narcissist but she insisted I was asocial personality disorder instead. Haven’t heard that label in a while tho. I think I’m just sza.
176049848,I went shopping. Traffic has been horrible here for the holidays. I went in Friday for some work at the cricket club and coming home I spent 2 hours and 20 minutes for what is usually a 45 minute car ride. The next day was just as bad. So today. Went and bought some clothes. Needed some shorts bad. I split the second pair I owned and it’s just not good going out in public with split shorts. haha. Anyways I’ve got some nice new shorts and we had a good take out burger from a local restaurant for lunch… All in all a great day…
176049849,"I am a fair and honest person Life is good and developing Today will be a good day I am greatful that I’m not 96kg anymore. I am greatful that I live in the UK. I am greatful for my siblings. I am in love with myself…this one I learnt from my course, I need to fall in love with myself"

176049851,"Thank God, For screenshots, Now I can save, Useless pictures on my phone."
176049852,I used to be obsessed with demons and thinking I was possessed by one and vexed by others. On meds those obsessions went away.
176049853,"My voices are condescending “bless him” , “aint he sweet” blah blah. Some might say its comforting - but when your hearing them in bed at 2am, it pisses you off. I was told to engage with them from a nurse instead of ignoring them. When i answered back tho - they got worse. But now i actively take the piss outta them - and for me that works better now. They only creep back when the depots due now tho. And thats when i do my 25mg 's ."

176049858,Tl;dr _AT_MENTION_ have you been assessed recently? This sounds like DID to me. No offense in any way.
176049859,"Oh yes, very……………."
176049860,"yeah thats what i just listed was the internal type visions. there called closed eye hallucinations. , its weird cuz I can still seem them with my eyes open if that makes sense. like in the minds eye it will be playing, and if i closed my eyes again its right back to continuing what it was doing. here according to this wiki article its labelled in levels. en.wikipedia.org Closed-eye hallucination Closed-eye hallucinations and closed-eye visualizations (CEV) are a distinct class of hallucination (technically a pseudohallucination since there is generally awareness that the perceived experience is not real). These types of hallucinations generally only occur when one's eyes are closed or when one is in a darkened room. They can be a form of phosphene. Some people report closed-eye hallucinations under the influence of psychedelics. These are reportedly of a different nature than the ""open... mine were what I guess would generally be a level 4 and 5. , without doing drugs or anything of course, just 
the psychosis was like that. id say im pretty much 99% of the time at level 3 or 2. mind is almost never blank. when my mind becomes blank and quiet it can be unnerving and at times uncomfortable actually cuz im so used to it. its kinda like when your voices go away for a while and your wondering why its so quiet and checking to see if its really gone."
176049861,I have small episodes multiple times a day. I’d say I’m still symptomatic but my insight is intact.

176049864,"It takes 4-5 days for me to crash. It sucks and it’s not worth it, but I 100% understand the temptation. Also, I ALWAYS question my diagnosis when it comes time that I don’t wanna take meds or don’t think I need them. Chances are, you probably need them."
176049865,I felt the whole despised me… that I was evil. It was my ‘delusions of persecution.’ My act was my way of trying to show the world that I was not evil…that I cared… I was higher than any drug could ever get you. I felt on some level that i was uniting mankind in goodness.
176049866,I have medicaid and they give me an outrageous deductible because I make too much money from my disability money which is 900 a month cant afford their deductible so I cant use them to get meds
176049867,"Thats a good question to ask as some are putting on a show for everyone. People are lonely and even though your mate can’t meet all one’s needs our love should grow and become more and better. It should become OK with both of you and mature into what? more and better I guess, completeness for both of you. I was just thinking yesterday about this. So many let it get old and are just putting on."
176049868,I haven’t found that minority of people who do good things (at least to me) in real life.
176049869,Me too. Bought some things that I have to return. And am thinking some mean pdoc is after me because he made some crude remarks. Having murderers after me telling me I’m going to die.
176049870,"Ya, that:s my wife."
176049871,If you have any sleeping medication I’d recommend trying that. You can usually get some at a place like Wallgreens over the counter also.
176049872,I dont want to be the center of attention but it just kinda sucked cause I’d start to like “My character I gonna d-” and somebody would cut me off. This one guy in particular really kept talking over and interupting me. And at one point the DM gave me information to tell the others about a character and I got cut off and brushed aside. And its like I know I’m not the strongest rolepalyer but idk it just really hurt to get brushed off like that. Thank you though _AT_MENTION_ I hope next week is better
176049873,It’s been a while since I brought it up. Might need to revisit it. Had to increase my AP dose because I started working and it brought a whole new wave of fatigue.

176049875,"Definitely things are speeding up. Just in the past 100 years technological and medical advances have been advanced to a degree that 500 years ago were only in the imaginations of people like _NAME_ (flying machines, etc.). Multiple theories abound about good vs. evil connected with how the world could end if evil wins. We are not alone in worrying about such things. I don’t think you’re crazy. But I also hope that such thoughts don’t keep you up at night. I myself just am thankful every morning and night that we still have a planet to live on. I also do my best to make sure I live responsibly and applaud those who are busy trying to save the environment, avert war, etc."

Another that’s annoying is “triggered.” Word usage stems from PTSD aggravation. You’re not triggered by the high gas prices today or that they’re out of Metamucil at the pharmacy, you twit.

Off my medication my life is a nightmare…my grades go from being all A’s and B’s to barely scraping by and often failing…even on medication many aspects of life are challenging and overwhelming to me such as getting dressed, showering, brushing my teeth, even simple things like taking my meds or changing a pad can be stressful and a process for me. Nothing in my life is effortless. (Except maybe eating! Ha!) That is something a lot of mentally healthy people take for granted I think. The ability to just LIVE without every little thing being a battle with yourself to do it. I am so envious of people who can just wake up, shower, brush their teeth and start their day without even giving it a second thought."

174354594,"Everyone is different. I have more luck with mood stabilizers than anti-depressants. I am more on the bipolar schizo-affective spectrum. I am sensitive to anti-depressants. That’s why I prefer to take Strattera for depression. But it’s definitely probably not good for psychosis. Lexapro didn’t seem to do anything to increase psychosis. But as far as my mood. I would feel a bit more better a sort of artificial lift, and then later a sort of darkness/worsened depression. And for me, I don’t really have technical depression. I struggle more with avolition, anxiety, and lack of feelings, feeling mostly sad. It may work for you. I hope it does. Wellbutrin is similar to Strattera I think it’s closer to Strattera. Lexapro is an SSRI so similar to Prozac. It also depends on the medications you are already on, and how they interact. Abilify regulates both dopamine and serotonin so I was able to tolerate an SSRI briefly but I still didn’t really like it. I don’t really know how the SSRI works. 
But I noticed that Abilify does not affect Strattera at all because the chemicals work differently. If I were on a SSRI Abilify would probably prevent the Lexapro from causing psychosis because Abilify stabilizes dopamine and serotonin. So maybe don’t start Lexapro unless you take a mood stabilizer??? I’m learning more about how medications work. I think I now understand why I’ve often heard people prescribed Abilify as a mood stabilizer or with an anti-depressant. That is probably the reason for Abilify also prescribed for Bipolar."

DID is always a result of trauma, so the trauma always precedes the disorder. You can have DID and schizophrenia (comorbidity). Also, people with DID hallucinate (hear voices), but there has to be trauma with DID."

174354601,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Model-Guided Antipsychotic Dose Reduction in Schizophrenia: A Pilot, Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Journal of clinical psychopharmacology , Jun 2019 10 Patients with schizophrenia as well as their psychiatrists are hesitant to reduce the antipsychotic dose in fear of relapse. To overcome such dilemmas, we developed models to individually calculate an oral dose that corresponds to a given target dopamine D2 receptor occupancy.In this pilot, 52-week single-blind randomized controlled trial, 35 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia receiving either risperidone or olanzapine monotherapy were randomly assigned to dose reduction (n = 17) or dose maintenance group (n = 18). In the former group, baseline doses were reduced to the doses corresponding to 65% D2 occupancy (the lower end of therapeutic window) at trough that were calculated from randomly collected plasma concentrations using our models.In the do
se reduction group, doses of risperidone and olanzapine were decreased from 4.2 ± 1.9 to 1.4 ± 0.4 and 12.8 ± 3.9 to 6.7 ± 1.8 mg/d, whereas the doses in the dose maintenance group were 4.3 ± 1.9 and 15.8 ± 4.6 mg/d, respectively. Twelve subjects (70.5%) and 13 subjects (72.2%) in the dose reduction and dose maintenance groups completed the study (P = 0.604), whereas 3 subjects (18.8%) and none dropped out because of clinical worsening in the dose reduction and dose maintenance groups, respectively. There were not significant differences in score changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale between the 2 groups but in Positive subscale scores in the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia (0.4 ± 0.7 in the dose reduction group vs -0.1 ± 0.7 in the dose maintenance group, P = 0.029).Although our model-guided dose reduction strategy was found to be comparable with no-dose change in terms of dropout rates, safety issues have to be further examined."

And when I’m in an episode, I become absolutely obsessed and they’re all I can focus on, I remember being in classes and just furiously writing down delusional belief after belief and not paying attention at all.

174354613,"Definitely Vraylar. Too early to say anything about Caplyta. There’s more hope and promise with Caplyta. I couldn’t work or do school on Vralyar because I became resistant to it and just drank a ton of energy drinks and smoked on it. I got my negative symptoms back. Only thing about Vraylar is it kept me out of the hospital for basically 3 years while on it. I saved the government and insurance a lot of money. I was also scared and hated the mental hospital since 2015 and what they did to me. I used to love the mental hospital, wanted to stay there and live there forever. It was like a resort. Now, I hate it and never want to go back. When I was on Risperdal and Latuda, I was hospitalized like 5 times in a row in less than a month in and out there. I was so paranoid. I’ve been in inpatient over 20 times and outpatient like 30 times over a 10 year period. I became resistant to Vraylar because I quit it a few times and it just wore off over the years. I started at 3mg or 4.5 mg and it was amazi
ng and great. I ended up resistant and got on 9mg which is way above FDA recommened dose. They even wanted to try 12 mg!!! Insurance only covers so much. Vraylar ended up costing my private insurance 2.4k a month… Actually, 42mg Caplyta is way cheaper like 1.6k a month. I was always going to the hospital because I felt safe, I was addicted, and I had crazy mood swings and severe depression and severe negative symptoms. Vraylar, mood stabilizer, and AD saved my life and saved my family and government tons of money. It also probably protected my brain from further brain damage. I might not even be here if it wasn’t for Vraylar."

176050027,i wonder if my looking back so much is detrimental to my mental health. at any rate i’ve had enough of it and want to move on in life. this time with out looking at my past. i want to get on with my life and build a future for myself even though i am 62 years. i feel i have enough skills now to do what i gotta do. hopefully i am right. _NAME_

176050033,My son doesn’t live with me but we go every other weekend to the movies and hiking or fishing and camping. I try to bring a normal father and son day. But it can be overwhelming
176050034,I’ve been on 50mg seroquel for the last 3 weeks and I think it’s giving me late nite hunger. I just kind of figured 50mg wouldn’t increase my appetite.

176050042,Yo guys I smoked weed again yesterday. I was with a friend and became really paranoid. Then some stuff that happened like when I was psychotic the first time (like my cellphone going crazy out of nowhere while I was listening to music). I think I had hallucination with faces aswell. It´s time to message my PDoc? Do you guys know if it was merely drug induced psychosis or i´m relapsing again? When I got home (I still don´t know how because I was heavily intoxicated) I puked.
174354612,"So a little background: I am 33 male dx’d schizophrenic. Started around 16 smoking weed getting a little paranoid started on meds. I’ve been on a dozen different meds, things went bad when I stopped meds. I’m back on seroquel/ closaril/Propranolol. Had 3 years clean/sober relapsed- now 2 months since. When I was using it was weed/crack/alcohol. Always gambled a lot finally gave it up. 2months no gambling my anxiety is Loads better but still some agitation. Been a while since hospitalization. Also bad thought broadcasting could never figure out why “normal” people say it’s not real. But I had a break through it seems sometimes my mind re-arranges what people are really saying into them repeating my thoughts. (thoughts on this?). I hate GD anxiety and psychosis I pray every night for it to go away. My life is good though just need a girlfriend? I like who I am just some delusions too- tv chatter and as I saw it termed dry orgasim which in my opinion must cause anxiety? Thinking of trying 
a new med but my quack believes closaril is the only way. Benzodiazepines aren’t prescribed in my area. High hopes, I have a B.S. in sociology, My goal is I wanna be a social worker. Like I said meds don’t work anymore- I live off of exercise, sobriety, work, my cat, friends, family, nice things, cold showers, golf, my car, apartment, among other things. Nice to no there are other people dealing with the same stuff."
176050043,"Today is bath day, I’m looking forward to it."
176050044,"over 10 I think, I’m not sure"
176050045,Depends wat u mean by psychosis
176050046,i’m not sure but i think it’s worth a shot to see if it improves you by taking away the dark thoughts. How often do you get dark thoughts?
176050047,Congratulations man that’s great.
176050048,it is look like herbal supplement
176050049,"I don’t hear voice. If i go off meds, I will have delusion and a slightly or moderate headache."

176050053,Any help whilst I find a job would be appreciated I am not sure if I can go on benefits
176050054,"Yes! you might even get better choices of meds, if evidently your still on it when you are 26 and have to get off your parents insurance. You need it as a crutch, and you can get payments and pay off increments of school if you get a balance. For some time, I didn’t eat all day at school because I couldn’t afford it, sometimes the café cashier gave me a free coffee because I was scrounging for change. Trusting the government: They wont hurt you, or devise a plan. Youre eligible for OVR when you graduate high school or college. They offer so many services for jobs, and you can even get financial support for school, they give you money in some cases!"
176050055,I think you should try it. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell people leaf.
176050056,Definitely! I get this every time I’m stable. Get tempted to come off meds each time. Sometimes I lower dose to try…and get psychosis all over again. Then next time I’m well I doubt I ever had sza and try coming off again. I never learn…I lose insight every time. Feel like I faked it and voices tell me I’m liar and hypocrite

174354620,Thank you for the info although it frightens me too hear that I’ll be attached to a lifelong _USER_ID_ and possibly involuntarily committed one day and medicated it may be for the best and getting the diagnosis may prevent those things from ever becoming a major issue.
176050059,Really feeling ???? again today had good news was happy almost for 5 mins then it all went to ???? been screaming i want to die into my pillow with music up so no one hears had my phone call to case coordinator he thinks the pdoc will do something to help me and told me to hang in their and call the mental health team line if it gets worse.

I was definitively much more social before my SZ. I hanged out with 25 friends and a gf, bars, shisha, restaurents, clubs, etc Since my diagnosis, I lost all of them including my gf.

176050084,"Hi all! So well, I continue fighting. Its tempting to want to try new meds, but I tried all the possible 11 aps here in the past, with no result, so when its bad here, I try to reason myself, that I don’t need more switching, yeap… I know in some cases you get better on paranoia in months, but in the same time, it remains a very serious illness, so I should remain patient… I go out a bit more, but always in the neighborhood with few social contacts. One of the worst things here are still my fears. Could you help me see if its still a paranoia or an anxiety? Maybe both? well, I can feel as a bad person when I socialize still… I think a lot of what the others think of me or how they see me… In the worst moments, I could fear an eventual aggression… The feeling of mine is often wanting to hide… It can get physical, I have this conversion disorder (somatic), because of those fears so I cant be quite active, no… But is it a paranoia or an anxiety? Or both? I am not sure you have a conver
sion disorder in paranoia, or maybe yes? Hugs for all of you, lets continue fighting ."
176050085,On Wednesday. I think a lot of my feelings are down to the nurse not contacting me. But I think this is more of a symptom than a cause. If I was well I would take things like this in my stride

176050087,"It denied me a husband and stepdaughter. More kids, but i have one so shouldnt whine. It denied me being able to really live with and care for him though. It denied me the comfort of normalcy indeed. A more carefree life. A calm relationship with family. And loads more. It also gave me more depth, a different perspective and more joy over things that normal people find…well…normal."
176050088,Mine is normal…
176050089,"If they have qualities to them that make them appear as “real” and external sensations, that makes them different from your verbal thoughts beyond just not being able to control them, then they could be considered hallucinatory.

176050101,I forgot to mention that I do not think you are overweight at all judging by your photos. To celebrate these new found curves I threw away all of my previous size 10 clothing in the hope of one day squeezing back into them and replaced them with a size 14 fashionable bigger girls style that I can wear with confidence and feel good in.

I prayed things would get better and they didn’t immediately but many years later I can laugh again and feel happiness."
176050113,Lately I’ve been having weird dreams. I haven’t had a med change or anything so I’m not sure why.
174354635,i think you were paranoid and stressed about them following you and your voices since you were thinking about the _NAME_ started saying they were from the _NAME_. I find it hard to believe transmitting voices is possible.

174354633,"Yah. when you get tired it is a little stressful. But you sound fine- not bonkers. Just part of your mind is affected but a good portion is doing and sounding well. If the meds are working then you should be doing better shortly. It sounds like you have a handle on what you mind is up to, so you can keep on track. I can tell you are putting in a lot of effort, but it does take effort to maintain. I bet that was a big, bad reaction you had to cold turkey, Clozaril so the have you on meds to compensate. Good luck, I’ll pray for you now."
176050119,Yea I’m skinny.
174354634,That’s what everyone says: I’m delusional. Feels so real sometimes. I doubt Clozaril would work. I already tried it…but it didn’t turn out to be a good try. Only Vraylar works for me.

176050133,"I attended for four years but I was never really there because I was invisible and didn’t really talk to anybody. I couldn’t really blame my problems on the school or even my fellow students. The teachers tried to teach me and I thought the teachers did their jobs good enough. I did have this woman teacher for English and she would lose her s*it and scream at us often but most teachers were not like that. No one forced me to smoke pot out on the field and then sit through the rest of my classes stoned and burnt out. No one forced me to cut classes or miss whole days all the time. Looking back, I wish more people liked me and I fit in better and talked to people more. I feel, I really missed out on life and wasted my youth in high school. I saw all the happy people and it was just never me."

176050153,"When I crave sweets, I have a teaspoon of honey or nutella and eat it real slow. That tends to kill the cravings. If it doesn’t, I’ll have a banana. I feel like I’ve gotten healthier since doing this, as I don’t run to the gas station at odd hours for overpriced candy anymore"

174354645,"The lyrics sound very personal. I hope you don’t really hate your life. As a schizophrenic the lyrics are relatable during certain moments of my life. I do have one thing to say, your rhyming pattern here is freaking awesome. Also your delivery comes a lot more natural now. I have to say you’ve improved a lot! Your flow is much better now."

If I felt I could shoulder a kid when sie needed me, I will have come a long way because I was never good at forgiving kids for being kids. They are just learning."
176050159,"I need some encouragement not to take it again. My anxiety is being fuelled by the fact I quit my job due to mental health issues being made worse by it. That was now two weeks ago. What timing that was with the lock down in the UK. I really have no idea how I will support myself and it’s making me very anxious, and I might have to take some Diazepam to help me get over this. Honestly the pills don’t seem to really do much anymore, so I might be barking up the wrong tree"
176050160,Nicee vocals were cool in the second one. Still trying to get a handle on what style to use for my voice For sure man! Maybe a collab even that would be cool
176050161,"I haven’t had alcohol in two and a half years. I do have a caffeine compulsion, though. I used to get obliterated when I got drunk. I get drunk and do all these crazy things and not remember it the next day. They say that blackouts and personality changes are the most telling symptoms of alcoholism. I’ve had both. My drinking days are over."

176050168,"I used to flag posts, but I no longer flag because of the new feature. Also, I no longer block quote or mention people’s names or directly respond to people (with a few exceptions), I just focus on the idea of the thread. Many threads I just stay away from because I know from experience that they’ll become contentious and get locked. Consequently, I’m not as active as I used to be, but that’s what works for me."

174354648,Olanzapine gave me Akathisia and I was on 25 mg. Made me fat ! Same as seroquil. Im on Clozapine now and it doesnt give me bad side effects. The weekly blood tests are a minor inconvenience. Im happy to have moved to Clozapine !

174354651,"I believe schizophrenia made me hypersexual too. I was always hypersexual since I was born. I blame the schizophrenia for having a severe hypersexuality. It sucks that I don’t have emotions and empathy more than sex. But Risperdal lowered my sex drive in exchange for my social and sex life, but now I have negative symptoms. My brothers beat me up because I was taking money from parents for erotic massages. My life sucked anyways, got into illegal stuff, prostitutes, weed, drug addict friends etc I prefer having negative symptoms and myself now staying in bed than having a risky unstable life."

176050179,"I finished my keto diet 4 days early, as i had run out of eggs. I measured my blood pressure thinking after all that salt in my bacon it would be through the roof. It wasn’t. It was low as 116/65. I have a bmi of 25.9 now which says a little over weight at 72.75kg, but it is mostly lean muscle. My metabolic age is down to age 49 ( I am 48) apparently according to my weighing scales… Now to maintain it… I can’t drink beer anymore because of my gluten allergy, and I gave up smoking 17 years ago. I have 12 units of alcohol a week and do 90 press ups in one go in the morning. I am aiming to get it to 100! A couple of years ago I was over 85kg, so am happy with the progress. I am blessed with will power so I am lucky in that sense. Eating healthily now, but could do with increasing exercise again. Anything to not be the sz statistic. You could do it too…"
176050180,"I get that way sometimes. I’ve accomplished stuff and still wonder how I did it when others haven’t. I feel like I don’t deserve it or something. I have to remind myself of how severely ill I was for years and all the hospitals I’ve been in and that I’ve been seeing therapists and psychiatrists for decades. I think of being in a hospital for 8 months and the 4 times I was strapped to a table in restraints. And I think, “Yeah man, you paid your dues, you deserve a little something out of life.”"
176050181,"They ask questions like that on psych tests. If you answer yes, they know you are in need of medicine."

176050185,I relate - I ended up absconding and was raped by someone offering me to smoke this oz of hash in his car. i have a 12+ hr loss of memory then so God knows what happened i’'d go out in just a top which i shrugged over my hips or in a hand made skirt which i thought made me sparkly my sister ended up rolling around in the mud having a mud fight with herself in the park

176050188,Yeah theyre pretty cool
176050189,It helps give me insight and tools to know how to deal with hallucinations. in my case I dealt with a lot of command hallucinations. I’d say its not something you can just read and magically your problem is solved but you have to practice what recommended. the case studies help show how other patients dealt with there hallucinations/delusions and there improvements.
174354657,"It can get better so don’t give up hope. There are periods where things are bad with SZ but usually there are also periods where, when on the right meds, you can take a breath of fresh air. I’ve been living, traveling, working, and enjoying life in general all over Asia for the last 8 years. Being in a positive environment is very important."

174354658,"One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia and the “schizophrenia spectrum” personality disorders (schizoid, schizotypal,) is social anhedonia. Lack of enjoyment and desire to socialize with other people. It seems like the only mental disorders that feature long lasting social anhedonia are the schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Major depressive disorder has social anhedonia but only while the mood symptoms are around, while shizophrenia anhedonia is lifelong. Most people immediately think of delusions and hallucinations when thinking about schizophrenia but isnt social anhedonia just as big of a specific symptom? Is it possible to be a loner or a “weirdo” or “odd” without having either schizophrenia or a “schizo” personality (cluster A) disorder?"
176050198,The problem with coming off meds is this : 1st month honeymoon period : “wow this is great” 2nd month : This isn’t so good but I can put up with it 3rd month : I can fly so I’ll jump off a building as I’ve completely lost insight. More or less.

176050202,"Was this by chance in the 90s or early 2000s? Before regulations got tightened, doctors would prescribe oxycodone for loads of reasons, because it was cheap, effective, and kept patients quiet. That is how we got into the opioid crisis of today."

176050208,"My mind slowed down alot since ive been on medication. Before i would be talking a mile a minute in my head. Now it’s just kinda quiet. I can still think fast in my head, but its tiring. I really only use it when i need conversation topics, then my brain does a brainstorm fast."

176050212,"I think if healthcare and education was free, and there was a cap on how much medicines were allowed to cost, the US would have less people struggling. Denmark has this system where when you pick up a prescription medication, it’s total cost is added to the computer system via your social security number. The more the total cost of your medicines has been that year, the more of a discount you get. Last year I got to 80-90%. Also minimum wage needs to be raised to match the cost of living. I do agree that some basic universal income could be beneficial, but I agree with those who say it should just be enough to cover the basics."
176050213,"I come up with delusions because of my voices. One thing I also do is come up with a delusional idea because of my thought disorder i.e: My thought process is disturbed, a thought “leaves” my head.

Also, “Polovstian Dance”, by _PERSON_, and “Laredo”, which I also have a YouTube video recording of on my smartphone. I am now recording master pianists playing my pieces so that I will know what these classical scores are supposed to sound like when played. Because I am totally unfamiliar with classical music and up to now, I have been playing blind (deaf). (I’ve been a rocker all my life.) I should have started this way sooner and if I had had better teachers, they would have encouraged this. But, no!!! Oh well. Better late than never."
176050215,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Thank you. Living with psychosis and a physical disability is hard. I’m honestly so tired of it all- I get worn out more these days. I am trying to keep going and not give up.

176050228,I have thought that people I met in the Psych Ward and elsewhere were not the people they claimed to be but were “plants” being used to deal with me. I do recognize my own family but I have thought that I was in Purgatory in the past although I could not accurately trace back to where I had “died”. An unrelated belief was that my dead father inhabited my body while I was on Latuda because I was more at ease with women than I had ever been before or sense even though my father who seemed at ease with women at times actually spent a good portion of his life in solitude. I found I was a different person on Latuda than I was on Invega.

174354669,Why do you want to stop meds? You don’t have paranoia and positive symptoms without them?
176050231,Thats very nice!
174354666,I would ask your pdr about it. It depends on severity of your positive symptoms. Me they are severe so lowering to 37mg would give me psychosis.

174354672,"Avolition is tought to treat, like all the other negative symptoms. Have you tried Glycine heard it works for negative symptoms. I havent tried it because my negative symptoms arent that bad, have a fullfime job mortgage and all that so coping well. I would suggest trying that. The other option is to talk to your pdoc about changing meds or lowering dose since different antipsychotics have a different effect on negative symptoms"
176050243,i tried homeopathy with a cpl of doctors few years back but it didnt help me in anyway
174354673,"I suffer negative symptoms too. I have to trick myself into showers and washing my face/brushing my teeth every night. It’s a constant struggle to do housework and take care of my mother in law. But I run our whole house and it looks pretty good in here, All despite my negative symptoms. Just because I don’t FEEL like doing it, doesn’t mean I CAN’T. I think you suffer from negative symptoms like me, but instead of powering through, you’ve learned to rely on other people. You need to slowly take back your life. I don’t know what the difference is between the two, but I know it doesn’t really matter. The only way you can treat negative symptoms is to work on it, medicines don’t help."

176050247,"Like everybody else my normal thinking is just a steady flow and im not aware of my own thinking. But all of a sudden my thinking goes slow and im painfully aware of my ”thinking about thinking.” And then i start to talk loud with my own thoughts (about thoughts) and im caught up in this involuntary awareness of thinking while i’m talking loud to my own thoughts. It’s very annoying and often i have to go to bed… Then after a couple of hours it stops, for no reason, and im very relieved. Well, i guess there is a reason for my SZ disorder - and thanks god i don’t suffer from lack of thoughts / emptiness. It’s the worst thing i have ever experienced."
176050248,That’s great _AT_MENTION_ ! Are you losing?
176050249,"I know that sz made me less social, I just have one friend that I just talk to online now. There is another one but he just text me once in a month when he needs help with buying electronics."

It helped when i accepted that i have the disorder. I still have a lot of diffuse pain and strange physical symptoms but i don’t go to doctors anymore, i just accepted that it’s something psychological. Somatoform disorder is very common if you have Schizotypal disorder, like i have. Hope you get better and that Lyrica is helping you (i was on 600 mg and it it didn’t help me)"

176050270,Yikes. Thankfully where I live psych nurses are some of the best paid nurses because they are in such high demand. It is not a field many choose to go into.

Maybe you’ve been in this delusion so long it’s difficult for you to break out. I dunno, bobbilly…I only know that I’ve been where you are and it’s very easy for me to see that you are severely deluded. Because of this it makes it very difficult to believe your other assertions that your doctor is out to get you and people are stealing your money. It all sounds like paranoia and delusions to me."

174354696,Everyone reacts in their own way to aripiprazole so I can’t give you an answer. But ostopersosis is no joke!!! So perhaps it is worth giving 5mg a try. And coming off it immediately well with a 2.5 mg weaning.if side effects are intolerable. I personally think very high prolactin probably does other bad things as well so it’s great that you are considering change.

They are good at being good to me, and if I say like I think I need another boost in xanax, the pdoc will call me herself or the nurse with an ok within 4 hours. Unmedicated as far as APs and ADs she would rather give me the xanax to kinda sedate the waters. But only at my or hubby’s request.

176050368,"Frustration is understandable, given the nature of the illness. Meds aren’t all sunshine and rainbows, especially antipsychotics. They can have pretty harsh side effects, something you’ll find discussed frequently on this forum. But they do serve a purpose, and that’s to help establish some normalcy-- a baseline, if you will-- in one’s life. I was against meds for about 5 years of this illness, and I will tell you that after agreeing to take them, I feel much better and have greater ease with functioning in society. Yes, I did have side effects, but the pros outweighed the cons in the end. I recently stopped meds for about a month and a half, and it was not a wise decision on my part. Granted, I did not relapse, but the symptoms intensified greatly. So I urge you to reconsider stopping your medication, as being med-compliant could lead to you leaving the group home in a timely fashion, and embarking on a fulfilling path in your young life."

I may have lucked out and found a doctor who was good but I had bad ones when I was younger who didn’t listen much or take me seriously.

I believe that my mother and her mother either have bipolar or schizoaffective. I have been diagnosed with bipolar I that has psychotic features. I do have “psychosis” outside of depression and mania. However, this psychosis is nowhere as bad as the type in depression and mania. It is redundant to consult with my psychiatrist because the treatment will not change. The psychosis that I experience is relatively mild. I have strange beliefs, paranoia, disorganized thoughts. Sometimes, I do strange things. I converse with myself. I behave more “schizotypal” around these phases. I have always had disorganized thinking, ever since I was very young. I handle it extremely well but it still impedes me in English class. I occasionally hallucinate. I cannot describe my thought process. It is either hollow with something inside or full 
yet numb to feeling anything there. I feel derealized at times. I do not think that I have delusions though. I only have delusions when it becomes intense which is during mania and psychosis. I have a lot of apathy and “negative symptoms,” even when I feel normal. My psychiatrist told me that my psychosis is in an earlier phase."

I will say I’ve never really felt “supported” under CMHRS specifically. I would love to have someone to meet on a regular basis that would help me get my life in order - talk about things that bothered me, help me find things I can do that are productive. Help me plan my future etc. I also really wish they would facilitate in house work schemes and not just hand me over to some job agency that doesn’t have my interests at heart at all. But the NHS don’t want to fill either of those roles. Instead its just take your drugs and learn coping strategies so you are less of a bother to us.

174354718,"This isn’t meant to encourage cocaine use in any way. So don’t interpret this as a reason to do those drugs. Some researchers staged a test. They made a cage with two little knobs inside and put two mice inside. If the mice pressed one knob it gave them food. If they pressed the other knob it gave them cocaine. The mice quickly learned how to operate both knobs. The mice starved to death. That’s one example of what cocaine and crack do to you. I smoked crack four years and got addicted and learned the hard way what those substances do. Me and the mice put those drugs before survival and many other addicts do too. You ask any true addict how much danger and trouble they willingly faced to get and use their drugs. You will hear some wild stories of people risking their lives (or others lives) for crack or cocaine Once you cross that line into addiction your life will revolve around getting and using drugs, the craving and obsession is overwhelming once you’re hooked. If you’re currently usi
ng or thinking of trying cocaine don’t think it could never happen to you; addiction does not discriminate, we’ve all heard of the proverbial soccer mom who gets hooked on pills. Well, anyone can become addicted to coke too from any walk of life if they try it or if they just start off as a recreational user or casual user. When you do those drugs they make you feel in control. But soon enough the drugs control you. Drugs in general are bad news but these two drugs are particularly insidious. I could write a few pages of how these drugs wreck your life. I risked my life to get them, I spent all the money I had set aside for bills on cocaine instead. Regularly. Being a schizophrenic, I was always low on money but if I got ahold of $20.00 it was off to the neighboring city for a rock. And once that rock was smoked up in ten minutes it was time to walk 3 miles to the ATM to withdraw $20 or $40.00 and walk back to score and typically this was how my days and nights went, walking back and forth to the bank and 
withdrawing my SSDI money for a few rocks. When I took the first hit of the day, it was ‘screw’ everything else going on in my life and all I was worried about was getting my drugs. Had to have them. I sold or traded all my possessions, I literally sold the clothes off my back for just a few hits. Sometimes I tried to trade my shoes for crack but that didn’t work. But I would have done it. I lost the trust of my sisters. My poor dad stuck by me though, even though I wrecked and trashed two of his cars and embarrassed him by conning money from all his neighbors and other bad things. That’s just a testament to his character, he was a loyal man, especially to me even though I often violated that trust. I used my monthly food money for drugs, I lost 25 lbs. without realizing it until my friends pointed out that I looked like a freed inmate from a WWII concentration camp. I remember one night driving around in my Datsun and giving a ride to a stranger so he could score some crack for me. We got it but it w
as gone fast. He looked at my tape deck in my car and offered me a rock for it. I said, “sure” and he ripped out of my dashboard leaving a gaping hole and a bunch of wires dangling. We stopped at a gas station and I went in the restroom to smoke up. I got high and came back to the car and soon and I wanted more and more. Anyways, most of that was typical. It got much, much worse often during those years. But to make my prior point, I had a good middle class upbringing. I grew up comfortable in a nice city where most of my families friends were either upper middle class or millionaires. I went to nice schools, we had a nice car and we had the nice clothes’ we needed and lived good. I was a good kid and so were my friends. We did a few mischievous acts of vandalism or stole a bike or two and later started smoking pot but we weren’t hard core at anything. But I ended up not only as a schizophrenic at 19 but in the late 1980’s I became a crack addict too. And the people I smoked with were occasionally m
urderers, prostitutes, ex-cons or small time hoods. I discovered these things sometimes but often I picked up strangers at night to get drugs, but I knew nothing about them while we drove all over hell and back looking for drugs and I had no idea what the background if the guy or girl sitting a foot away from me all night was. I partied the majority of the time with rough looking people. They were probably a little scared of me but not much. Anyways, this was my background, I’ve celebrated 30 years clean on January 31st of this year. AA, CA, and NA is how I got clean. They probably saved my life, near the end of my addiction I was getting into some bad situations. Anyways, I wrote my experience in the hope that maybe some addict will relate, or just as good, maybe I will influence someone to avoid using in the first place. Hopefully, just maybe, this will plant a seed in someone’s mind of the dangers of cocaine so if you are tempted to start using, you will decline and avoid all the typical addict crap I 
went through. Like the speakers in a lot of the over 1000 meetings I went to would say, “You don’t have to use, I did all the research for you and it’s bad out there. Learn from me.” I hope someone get’s something from all this. Doing drugs doesn’t take a genius, anyone can do it. It’s getting clean that takes a monumental effort. Good luck."

174354730,"An association between schizophrenia and subsequent breast cancer has been suggested; however the risk of schizophrenia following a breast cancer is unknown. Moreover, the driving forces of the link are largely unclear. Here, we report the phenotypic and genetic positive associations of schizophrenia with breast cancer and vice versa, based on a Swedish population-based cohort and GWAS data from international consortia. We observe a genetic correlation of 0.14 (95% CI 0.09–0.19) and identify a shared locus at 19p13 ( GATAD2A ) associated with risks of breast cancer and schizophrenia. The epidemiological bidirectional association between breast cancer and schizophrenia may partly be explained by the genetic overlap between the two phenotypes and, hence, shared biological mechanisms. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18492-8"

174354745,"From my experiences. You have to be on medication for at the minimum two years. You also have to be considered stable i.e. no hospital visits to the psychiatric ward, no involuntary holds, no major symptoms, that sort of thing. And then, MAAAYBE, you can talk to your acting psychiatrist about reducing dosage or if you take minimum dose, then weening off meds. It sounds like a long time two years, but they fly by the older you get. In the meantime, maybe a med change would help, I’d also recommend you focus on finding a medication that works for you. Try to remain stable. Find a hobby or an activity, that sort of thing. There is a diagnosis called “residual schizophrenia” it is generally given to older patients, or patients who have been diagnosed for awhile and have not exhibited any symptoms under treatment. Also this article helped immensely in me getting a chance to get off medication with a doctor’s recommendation… chicagotribune.com Study finds some schizophrenics do well without lon

176050533,"I read a couple of _NAME_ books and I think he has a lot of good ideas. It really helps to see yourself in a group of hopefully coherent roles which in my case are husband, son, brother, patient, tenant, car owner, pet owner, inlaw, friend… _PERSON_ also says you should have a “Sharpen the Saw” role of fostering mental, spiritual, social and physical aspects of your life. In each area it’s good to ask “What can I do this week in this role that would have a significant impact?” I think I feel my spirituality lately feels more about how I treat everyone around me. My dad is very sick and grumpy and needs a lot of help. It takes patience to deal with people who don’t feel well. It takes patience to deal with angry and bitter people and not feel resentful at some of their opinions. I think much spiritual growth comes from dealing with irritating situations and not just isolating oneself."

176050574,Welcome to the boards. Pays to be patient regardless of the label. These days it’s more about the treatment anyways so take the pills as prescribed and just ride it out. Symptoms change over time and with medication so you’ll find that most people here have had different diagnosis through the course of their treatment. I was dxed depressive at 23. Sz at 29 as an example. It will become apparent so the important thing is maintaining treatment.

176050576,"I’ve been having nightmares since May 10, 2019. My family and I had a near miss on the on ramp. This has to lead me to believe that the car was sent by one of the white cars. Now I have been remembering the nightmares for the most part. Some nights I don’t but that doesn’t stop the fear or feeling of something missing that I get each time I wake. Sometimes I even wake up with a sense of not knowing where I am. Sleep scares me. And because of that, I have been wanting to not sleep. So, I’ve been wanting to not take the additional Respirdal that I have been prescribed. But I am taking under the only fact that I have no choice. I also think sleep is stealing something from me but I don’t know what. I have an option of another pill this one to help with nightmares but I don’t want it. My dreams are the spies-white cars- losing my loved ones in accidents/situations that don’t’ make sense.

176050641,"a new (to me), book called “Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works”, by _NAME_ and _NAME_, both registered dieticians. The book was written in 1995 and has been updated several times. In it, they describe a program that calls for forgetting the “dieting mentality” and just eating whatever you want, whenever you want, however much you want, all the while listening to your hunger and satiety cues. Their program tells you to stop counting calories, fat and carbohydrate grams entirely and to give yourself “permission to eat unconditionally”. They say that once your body gets used to the idea that you are not going to starve it anymore through your dieting behavior, your body starts to trust you again and your metabolism normalizes. And once you start listening to your hunger and satiety cues, you will quit the vicious dieting cycle of starvation and bingeing that lowers metabolism and creates weight gain. I’ve already been putting this eating philosophy into practice since T
hanksgiving and it’s already working beautifully. It’s now Sunday after Thanksgiving. By the way, I highly recommend the book."
176050642,Have you tried Haldol? It really helped me in the hospital and for a few days I had my personality back and didn’t feel paranoid anymore. Problem was I was too scared to tell anyone and I didn’t have all of my memory back from stopping my meds so I don’t remember those days so good but the first time my boss came to see me he said I really could learn to like this guy. I happen to remember that and it made me feel good. He already knew me on meds. In about a week or so the Geodon kicked back in and I was back to my new normal. No personality and paranoid as hell. It’s worth a shot and Geodon has me stable enough to work so you still have that to try too.

176050643,"my childhood bully was also a small guy. tried to fight me, my first day of public school in the 3rd grade. after that he was always trying to start stuff on the playground but i backed down. this continued for 4 years, until we we’re separated in the 7th grade for academic reasons. i still have this fear of him for some reason. i saw him in town a few years ago and crossed the street. now he is still lawless and into drugs, always getting arrested. i try not to think about what he might do to me if he was motivated. i just hope he forgets about me. now that i’ve moved to another town, there is not much to fear. im a small guy myself, but a good 5 inches taller than him. he was always getting into fights at school. i think the situation kinda worked itself out as i avoided him, and with his natural inclination to be combative, he developed other rivals."
176050644,I guess i have to just avoid this guy because he tries to trigger me. I thought he stalked me online in this forum just to spite me because he is an ??????? with personality issues. Its too bad actually. I like this forum bc i find it supportive but i dont like it spoiled by this jackass. I still come here bc i dont want his presence deterring me to enjoy reading the posts. I just dont click on his posts.
176050645,Going out for a little drink and dance at the weekends is good for you. I don’t like loud music either.
176050646,For me it started with a therapist. He had nothing to gain. He had a belief system I liked. And he struck a cord with me. His name was _NAME_. But you’ll have to find your own _NAME_. Someday hopefully you will and stop torturing yourself.
176050647,I feel nothing and feel like sh!t at the same time.
176050648,"Just was in a daze or something and didn’t do anything. Maybe worse negs maybe??? I ate half as much, had 20 times more energy but just stared at a wall and spent too much money. I had no interest in driving and hated it because of my illness. I was losing sense of direction or time in life like forgetting priorities and still not showering, brushing teeth, and seeing my dad. Its hard to explain. I was just stuck in my head but I felt less delusional for the firsr time in my life. But I was paranoid about what I posted over the past 10 years and how I ruined, screwed up my life. I think something nasty and evil did happened in college back in 2011 but there’s no apparent evidence or stuff done to get mental compensation. My illness feeds the delusions. Its so crazy I feel like its everything. I feel like I’ll never get a job and if I did they would try to ruin everything and sue me or worse for libel and slander despite me being hurt and not knowing what happened. I felt okay with thought ins
ertion and them reading my mind. The only explanation I have is aliens, military, industry, Hollywood, and the illuminati. Not sure why me. I was a nobody. Perhaps just some _NAME_ kinda guy that survived and was experimented on. My thoughts say these people don’t make mistakes so even though I escaped I must have begged for my life… That and nobody in my family remembers me missing. Now the theme of my thoughts are that im expelled permanently and indefinitely for mental health and talking “crap”. I’m afraid ill be sued or worse or have evil people come after me. Ive had some strange coincidences happen and scary stuff happen in the ghetto nearby. But alas I’m safe and okay for now…"
176050649,"With long-term administration, the most frequent (occurring in ? 5% of patients) treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of whether such adverse event was related to treatment, were decrease in weight (9.5%), dry mouth (7.6%), diarrhea (7.0%), and headache (5.1%). The proportion of patients experiencing motor side effects while on lumateperone was low: any adverse event related to extrapyramidal side effects combined including akathisia (5.3%); and akathisia specifically (0.5%).

176050650,This is mostly a vent. Lately my mental hwalth has been extremely unstable ever since i started school. I dont think itw actually school doing it because i extremely enjoy doing my school work. Im an art student. But its made my job completely insufferable. I dread going in because i feel like ive finally found what makes me happy. Art. I tried looking for jobs dealing with art but my availability sucks so im having a hard time finding a new job. I have an interview today for Goodwill. I figured its lower stress than my current job at least so maybe ill be a little happier. Plus i know theres a ton of cool lgbt people that work there. Ive been taking my meds as prescribed besides occassionally missing a dose. But im finding certain situations srt off my paranoia really easily lately. For example my dog almost got ran over by a person on a bike last night (she ran after him). I love my dog so much that i got freaked out thinking she could have just died. This made me start to think someone was after 
me and that they were going to do bad things to me. I havent been able to shake it off and now im suicidal again. Im just so sick of being like this.

174354767,"I have both but I had to be assessed by an autism specialist. Yes they can be confused for each other but theres ways to differentiate the two. Autism was initially thought of as childhood schizophrenia, before they realized autism extends throughout life. Theres a lot of overlap. But generally autisms frankness and trouble with social reciprocity has different thought process than paranoia and social isolation in schizophrenia. For me I had to look st my childhood and tease out what was autism and what was mental health. I couldnt make friends but I tried so hard. I didnt like eye contact or touching. I had sensory issues. Now schizophrenia has kind of taken over and I dont want friends or to talk to anyone. I no longer care about fitting in and my hallucinations arent sensory overload issues. I get both. It takes a lot of research and soul searching to figure these things out"

They create a nearly perfect artificial world, but I can see and know it’s artificial and get scared. I guess you could argue that even the physical senses are part of a very sophisticated illusion (like the Buddhist do). But as i understand you - we don’t share this simulation?

176050781,"My social worker haven’t done anything for me to move forward with my life… I asked to move countless times and be more independent. I had a moment of clarity… I remember my housemate social worker saying to him how he should become more independent and how she’s going to help him get his own place. It accrued to me - she’s not bothered about him being more independent but its to save social services money, I was looking at it the wrong way around. Its not that his social worker is being more pro-active then mine and helping him more forward with his life, she’s actively encouraging him to move out of supported living as it’s expensive and when he’s in his own place they’ll total cut his support. She’s already cut his hours down from 15 to 10 a week on the pretence that he’s more independent and he’s doing well, he lapped that up, he’s easily influenced which many people with Intellectual difficulties are. He doesn’t see the bigger picture. He’ll move into his own prop
erty and initially he’ll continue getting his 10 hours support a week, then gradually they’ll cut them. I thought it was because social services don’t give a crap about me when in fact they don’t give a crap about my housemate. I know a person with actual mild Intellectual disabilities (not learning difficulties) who don’t get support from social services as they’ve been denied it at assessment. This person has quite a few difficulties. He’s fortunate he gets lots of support of his parents. My housemate doesn’t have any support outside supported housing as he was a foster kid, he doesn’t have support networks outside supported housing, he’ll be on his own without support… I know so many people who’s had their hours drastically cut. Him moving out is a cost cutting excise, not that they are supporting him better. They don’t want me to move out as I’m severe in comparison to my housemate… I need the support."

176050797,"From two of the trials it seemed about on par with risperidone in terms of reduction in symptoms. In the Nature paper on receptor occupancy there was one person who for whatever reason processed the medication differently and had a ~50% occupancy (vs 39%) and he had a greater reduction in symptoms. However that’s one guy. Also that level is considered to be under the threshold for the worst side effects of D2 blocking APs. My guess is overall it’ll end up being about as effective as others, you’ll have some for whom it works great, some for whom it doesn’t work at all, and most of the people will be in the middle with partial relief. Probably the best thing about it is its possibly much better side effect and safety profile."

176050809,"In 1990, President _NAME_ passed the Americans with Disabilities Act that sought to bring to people with disabilities what the Civil Rights Act brought to minorities. It gave people with disabilities a legal footing to demand equal treatment. Since then, good steps have been taken to integrate people with disabilities, such as accommodating students with disabilities, making walkways and buildings accessible, and making a special effort to help the disabled find work. Despite the positive steps, though, much work remains to be done. people with disabilities still occupy an inferior position in society through no fault of their own. They still battle public perception that makes assumptions about them that may not be true, simply as a consequence of their disabilities. Their struggles are numerous, but here are 10 of the most significant. Employment Working arrangements, and many working environments, are designed for people without disabilities. Although it’s illegal to discriminate against someo
ne for a disability, it’s common knowledge that it happens often. What’s worse, people with disabilities may discriminate against themselves by assuming that they won’t be able to find work. There’s a pervasive assumption that just because people aren’t “abled,” then they must not be capable. The truth is there’s plenty of work that people with all sorts of disabilities could perform. Some states have made a special point of promoting employment for disabled residents. Work has such a central role in our lives, that when people are effectively barred from working for reasons out of their control, people can feel like second class citizens. Cost of Care The costs of care for people with disabilities can be extraordinary. The government helps families in most cases, but may not help enough. Certain physical disabilities require tremendous healthcare, and it’s widely known how expensive healthcare is in this country. In addition, people with both physical and mental disabilities may require aid
es living with them. This struggle more often than not affects the family, but when people with disabilities have no family to rely on, they must shoulder the burden of the cost. The cost can quickly become too much to bear when finding employment is difficult. It essentially forces people with disabilities to become “wards” of the state, depending on the government for handouts to pay bills and live. It’s a degrading position to be in, and one that surely many people with disabilities would gladly get rid of. Transportation Vehicles can be modified to accommodate those with physical disabilities, but the cost can be prohibitive. Public transportation companies have made great leaps to incorporate mechanisms that can accommodate the disabled. The accommodations are not universal, though, and the disabled still run into problems finding suitable transportation. Even when reasonable accommodations are available, public transportation is open to everyone, and sometimes the open spots for the handicapped ar
e occupied by the able-bodied. It can be humiliating for a disabled person to make someone else move to open up a seat. Some transportation companies have introduced vehicles specifically designed and reserved for people with disabilities, which is helpful, although it doesn’t do much to encourage integration. At the very least, though, it allows people with disabilities to find adequate transportation and not have to worry about making a public scene just to find a seat. Accessibility Some things are easily taken for granted by people without disabilities. Actions as simple as stepping up a curb or opening a door can be an insurmountable barrier to those who have physical disabilities. Granted, some communities have been reconstructing curbs at the corners to make them wheelchair accessible, but it’s still all too common to see curbs that no one in a wheelchair could ascend. The same difficulty persists with businesses. More buildings are coming equipped with push buttons to automatically open doors, but 
they are few and far between. The lack of accessibility limits what people with physical disabilities can do. They may be effectively barred from certain parts of their communities, including parks and walkways. Apart from entrances, some retail stores place their merchandise to close together that even someone walking can have trouble maneuvering through the store. There’s no chance that someone with a wheelchair or any kind of mobility device can move through. Educational Accommodations This is one struggle that many schools have addressed. Most public schools offer special education to attend to the needs of the mentally disabled. The physically disabled can still have trouble with a traditional classroom, though, and may be too advanced for special education. On top of that, some disabilities, such as blindness or deafness, would require specialized education that may not be readily accessible to some families. In the realm of private education, accommodations may be harder to find. Some colleges are co
mmitted to accommodating students with disabilities, and the syllabus for every course includes a boilerplate provision that permits disabled students to request special accommodations. Not every educational institution has made the commitment, though. people with disabilities deserve the same chance at an education as anyone else, and until all schools are ready and willing to make all necessary accommodations, people with disabilities will be unfairly limited. Relationships Romantic relationships are a major stumbling block for people with disabilities. Obviously they don’t have a monopoly on relationship problems, but disabled people in large numbers struggle to find partners, and in most cases the disability itself is the likely culprit. Regardless of whether the disability is physical or mental, people with disabilities suffer – much like overweight people – under society’s definition of attractiveness. People with disabilities must fight not only against the public perception of being unattracti
ve, but also against the biological preference for strong, healthy bodies. Whereas some can change their appearance, if they want, people with disabilities cannot just decide to stop being disabled. For many people with disabilities, it’s a long effort to accept their disabilities as part of their identities. It’s not fair to them for anyone to ask that they try to hide or deny their disabilities for the sake of finding love, but in a way, that’s what society asks of them. It’s a constant struggle, and one that will require a major cultural shift to correct. Parenting The plight of mentally people with disabilities who want to be parents was famously depicted in the film I Am _NAME_. In the movie, a mentally disabled man fathers a child with a woman who leaves as soon as the baby is born, giving full custody to the father by default. As the father struggles to learn how to be a father, the state steps in to remove the child from his custody, claiming that he is unfit to be a parent. The state’s conc
ern, and the concern that many people share, is that the man’s diminished mental development would quickly be outdone by his daughter by the time she reached the end of her primary education. The movie raises serious questions about what it means to be a parent. Does it mean having the capacity to help with homework, or does it mean providing support and love unconditionally? In the film, we see the child wanting to be with her father, and we see the child’s eventual foster parents wanting the child to have what she wants. The film doesn’t overtly argue that the man should have full custody of his daughter, but it leads us to accept that mentally people with disabilities can, indeed, be successful parents. Although the film makes for good cinema, it’s ending is not reflective of our society. Our culture still questions how well a person with mental disabilities can effectively parent a child. There’s also the perception that someone with any kind of disability will pass it along to a child. We belie
ve that having a disability is bad, and people with disabilities should not procreate and risk bringing more disability into society. Being Heard or Having a Public Voice people with disabilities struggle to find a public voice. With so much of society putting them in a position of being outliers who need special accommodations, people with disabilities tend to be taken less seriously or ignored. Able-bodied legislators may think that passing a law or requiring accommodations is all they need to do, that their job ends at that point. But people with disabilities want to be thought of and treated the same as anyone else. To give special treatment and make a big deal of providing special treatment is to act in a condescending manner, as if people with disabilities should be thankful that the able-bodied are so kind. We often talk about the need for a representative number of women or minorities in government positions. The same applies to disabilities. People without disabilities cannot fully appreciate the str
uggles of people with disabilities, and without sufficient advocacy, their place in society will always be a little less. Unfortunately, the social _USER_ID_ against people with disabilities will likely make it difficult to obtain positions of official power. Social _USER_ID_ Perhaps the most difficult battle people with disabilities face is public perception that they are somehow less than full citizens. They are perceived as less attractive or less capable of work. Sometimes, one disability leads to the assumption of other disabilities. Someone with a speech impediment, for instance, may be perceived as less intelligent, even though the individual may be highly intelligent. Disabilities have a way of making people uncomfortable, as if it’s a contagious disease. On the other hand, disabilities can also make people overcompensate and treat a disabled person with special favor, when all the person may want is to be treated as anyone else. People with disabilities are constantly reminded of society’s prefer
ence for people without disabilities. Some businesses balk at accessibility because it costs too much, which implies that concern for the bottom line trumps concern for treating people fairly. As mentioned elsewhere on this list, correcting social _USER_ID_ requires a full cultural shift. Changes are happening, but they happen slowly. Integration People with disabilities struggle to find a place in society. Due to the stain of social _USER_ID_, the lack of accessibility and necessary accommodations, and the tendency to make policies and designs for use by able-bodied people, people with disabilities find themselves left in the lurch. The Americans with Disabilities Act was a big step in the right direction, and society is slowly shifting toward integration, but full integration may always be elusive. The Civil Rights Act was passed nearly 29 years ago, and full racial integration is still on shaky ground. Public schools are racially segregated, and neighborhoods are often still segregated by choice (or econom
ics). Legislation was a step, but it didn’t alter the fabric of our culture. We could perhaps expect the same for people with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act was only passed in 1990, so quite possibly full integration could be a few decades away. Legislation doesn’t force shifts in cultural mores, and until society accepts that people with disabilities are as much citizens as able-bodied people, the _USER_ID_ and alienation will continue."

But for me last night it was all this paired with mumbling and a looming paranoia along with the feeling of being suffocated on and off. I recall trying to scream like I usually do when I get sleep paralysis but this time there was a clear voice telling me to shut up. Idk I think its pretty disturbing and it makes me afraid to sleep tonight. I guess my question is do you think this was just extreme sleep paralysis or do you think symptoms of schizophrenia were involved?"

176050892,I’ve a history. Depressive break with paranoid overtones to major break with psychosis. It’s not really in my future and after initial diagnosis it just isn’t brought up. There is a big percentage of people who recover from 1st episode psychosis and don’t need meds. Most folk around here if your multiepisodic or get breakthroughs then it’s meds for life or till a cure.
176050893,"That is what people say, but it’s objectively untrue. I don’t feel like looking up a source right now but like 2/3 of all welfare recipients are working a job that doesn’t pay them enough to stay above the poverty line, and something like 90% of people who use TANF or SNAP only do so for less than three months. It is paid for via tax dollars, but without it, the cost to consumers would be much higher, crime rates would go up, business profits would go down, etc. If you really want to get mad about people using welfare, get mad at the companies who pay their employees so little that they qualify for government assistance even though they work."

The only way we ever get anywhere is by people not being afraid to challenge the norm. Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex … it takes a touch of genius – and a lot of courage – to move in the opposite direction. “Sanity is a madness put to good uses.” “Maybe each human being lives in a unique world, a private world different from those inhabited and experienced by all other humans. . . If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn’t we really be talking about plural realities? And if there are plural realities, are some more true (more real) than others? What about the world of a schizophrenic? Maybe it’s as real as our world. Maybe we cannot say that we are in touch with reality and he is not, but should instead say, His reality is so different from ours that he can’t explain his to us, and we can’t explai
n ours to him. The problem, then, is that if subjective worlds are experienced too differently, there occurs a breakdown in communication … and there is the real illness.” ? _NAME_"

176050921,"Yes, this sounds better. One setback doesn’t mean you have to give up. Hey, doing good in an interview and getting hired on is an accomplishment to be proud of and a huge step. There’s other jobs out there that you may be better at. You might find a job like I’ve had for the last 5 years. Being a janitor ain’t prestigious or glorious but hey, I get paid $15.00 an hour to do light labor that ain’t complicated. The hours are great, my co-workers can be pretty cool, the work is easy. I get to work by myself most of the day. I’m among office workers often but that’s just emptying trash from a cubicle or office with a friendly person sitting there at a computer. So on many days I’m just dealing with one person at a time. I have so much freedom. When the boss has me empty wastebaskets I’m often really alone in a large area. A lot of the days the office workers are gone so it’s really quiet and I’m strolling around whole wings with just a few people scattered around occasionally in t
heir office. Anyways, maybe you wouldn’t want to be a janitor but I’m also writing this to show you that there are jobs that fit us out there. One thing you might want to look into is employment agencies that cater to disabled people. I don’t know if your area has them but I’ve been to several in my vicinity. The staff or counselors know you’re disabled and they not only get you ready for work with training, mock interviews for practice or help you write a resume but they find jobs for you and a lot of times the agencies work with business owners or companies in the community who will hire people knowing they’re disabled which takes the pressure off hiding it. These are free, I’ve tried several of them and they got me jobs. If you’re lucky they will have support groups for disabled people who work. But I always say, there’s a niche out there somewhere for us. There’s weird little jobs out there somewhere that pay OK and we can do. Good luck."

176050930,This is how I became before I was very very ill. Just becareful try not to overthink things because u then feed delusions which can lead to hallucinations in my case it did anyway
176050931,there were some powerful people in my life like my pdocs that treated with hatred. do you agree that sometimes you have to hate back to get well? when i look back at what i went through the help i didn’t get and the treatment i did get… i kind of want to hate them. _NAME_
176050932,"Yes. I was a very popular guy, when i was young, i had a lot of very close and good friends. Now i have two left. I can’t blame it all on the ones who left me, i had a very bad period of my life when i was stupid, arrogant and at the same time a wreck. Hope you find a friend soon _AT_MENTION_"
176050933,i feel like as a single person you have freedom. especially if your well and can purse a career and meet others and hobbies. I would prefer to have my soul mate though. i think sometimes married people don’t want to admit the problems with having kids and being committed like the difficulties that comes with. It also can make you dependent on someone more where if you single although it’s harder i think you grow more as a individual. Marriage is kind of a status thing in the USA. i’m not harping on marriage. I would like to get married hopefully. I just feel sometimes that married people envy single people more than they let on.

174354840,"I believe you can be sz or sza without hallucinations. _USER_ID_ says you basically need two positive symptoms or one positive symptom accompanied by negatives. So delusions and negatives could lead to a diagnosis of sz or sza of accompanied by a mood disorder. Or any combination of positives such as disorganized speech and catatonic behavior. I hallucinate but I’ve never really had delusions, unless you count my paranoia as delusions, except I still have insight so it isnt really a delusion I dont think. I personally wish I could have gotten a dx of psychotic depression as that sounds less bad than sza, but here we are. Actually I should ask my pdoc the difference between sza and psychotic depression. Maybe sza is longer lasting."

When a fat or older woman wears the same clothes, she is called revolting and told to cover up because “nobody wants to see that.” And yet, almost all female workout clothes are tight. So women can either be called a tease, be called revolting, or choose to shop exclusively in the men’s section."

For instance I have a lot of OCD and Anxiety, but I allegedly have Paranoid schizophrenia. But they dont give me 3 diagnosis. They give me schizophrenia only. If I were to read personality disorders I would qualify for paranoid, schizotypal, avoidant and etc. But no serious doctor would, except maybe for PTSD (wich I dont have). What Im trying to say here, is maybe your only diagnosis could be Schizoaffective with PTSD? Having both schizophrenic symptoms and bipolar symptoms is the schizoaffective, and the personality traits, can work within schizophrenia, to call you bipolar and depressive, It seems like they get paid per dix.

174354858,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The relationship between childhood trauma, dopamine release and dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms: a [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET study. _PERSON_, MM _PERSON_, RA _PERSON_, RA _PERSON_, MAP _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Translational psychiatry , Nov 2019 11 Childhood trauma is a risk factor for psychosis. Amphetamine increases synaptic striatal dopamine levels and can induce positive psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Socio-developmental hypotheses of psychosis propose that childhood trauma and other environmental risk factors sensitize the dopamine system to increase the risk of psychotic symptoms, but this remains to be tested in humans. We used [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography to measure striatal dopamine-2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability and ventral striatal dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release in healthy participants (n?=?24). The relationships between dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release, dexamphetamine-induced positiv
e psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and childhood trauma using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were assessed using linear regression and mediation analyses, with childhood trauma as the independent variable, dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release as the mediator variable, and dexamphetamine-induced symptoms as the dependent variable. There was a significant interaction between childhood trauma and ventral striatal dopamine release in predicting dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms (standardized ??=?1.83, p?=?0.003), but a mediation analysis was not significant (standardized ??=?-0.18, p?=?0.158). There were no significant effects of dopamine release and childhood trauma on change in negative (p?=?0.280) or general PANSS symptoms (p?=?0.061), and there was no relationship between ventral striatal baseline D2/3R availability and positive symptoms (p?=?0.368). This indicates childhood trauma and dopamine release interact to influence the induction 
of positive psychotic symptoms. This is not consistent with a simple sensitization hypothesis, but suggests that childhood trauma moderates the cognitive response to dopamine release to make psychotic experiences more likely."

176051054,"im back to vegetarianism now. in the past i was vegetarian for 3 years, then vegan for 4 long years. i was at my worst, being vegan. voices constantly, i was unmedicated, and i was obsessed about being a clean animal haha and not eating meat or dairy. the only benefit it gave me, is my skin dramatically cleared up not consuming the dairy. after a hospitalization, i realized i had no support to be vegan anymore, i was always at odds with the local culture, who loved their meats. veganism is not big in this area of the country. so i gave it up for my mental health, and began to eat meat again for a couple years. but just like last time, after a couple years, i felt guilty about eating animals, and felt like i was defileing myself and being unclean. so now i have gone back to vegetarianism because it’s not quite as strict as veganism, although i dont eat eggs, just cheese and yogurt. i don’t have to supplement being vegetarian and feel like i can still be healthy. i lift weights and can get about 
70-80 grams of protein a day eating this way. _PERSON_, one of the top powerlifters in america is vegetarian, can’t remember his name though. anyways im happy to be eating this way and have lost 25 pounds. and am happy to not be harming animals, other than the dairy. the hardest part is being around non vegans, who will socialize with food and offer you meat. just last night, my cousins boyfriend offered me deer jerky, and i just said “no thanks, i just ate”. so anyways what i do, is eat a little turkey on thanksgiving and that’s it for my meat consumption for a year. i do it, not to stand out, and don’t like to get into conversations with people about my vegetarianism, since it will only make me seem like even more of an outcast. although i could probably just have a big plate of the sides, so maybe that is what i will do. it’s my little secret, the mexican restaurant in town has a vegetarian section so if i go out and eat, that is where i go."

I cant do much outside… Theres also the fact, that my ap dopes me a lot after it take.

They just go by the last two months and tell me I can’t have a reference. I am currently job hunting after 4 1/2 years on disability. I have to give a reason for my gap in employment. I have just been saying that I had a long-term illness that is now in remission. I don’t think I would fully disclose to an employer again after my last experience. Anyone who isn’t an employer

176051158,"For quite a while some scientists thought it was conceivably real. Research, however, came to disprove it, or at least it failed to prove its existence. As I see it, people who defend a priori the existence of telepathy face two main challenges: Firstly, to explain the physical basis for this “telepathic transmission” between 2 or more brains. Are we talking about waves? What kind of waves? If so, how come they haven’t been detected? Secondly, what are the biological mechanisms underpinning this ability of the brain to tap into these “waves” or whatever it is that allows for this telepathic transmission to take place? Also, why only humans? For instance, A predator might benefit considerably from being able to read the mind of its prey. Is telepathy something unique to humans? How so? And if it isn’t, why haven’t we detected its presence in animals?"

174354914,"Increased stability in one’s daily routine is associated with well-being in the general population and often a goal of behavioral interventions for people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. Assessing behavioral stability has been limited in clinical research by the use of retrospective scales, which are susceptible to reporting biases and memory inaccuracies. Mobile passive sensors, which are less susceptible to these sources of error, have emerged as tools to assess behavioral patterns in a range of populations. The present study developed and examined a metric of behavioral stability from data generated by a passive sensing system carried by 61 individuals with schizophrenia for one year. This metric—the Stability Index—appeared orthogonal from existing measures drawn from passive sensors and matched the predictive performance of state-of-the-art features. Specifically, greater stability in social activity (e.g., calls and messages) were associated with lower symptoms, and gr
eater stability in physical activity (e.g., being still) appeared associated with elevated symptoms. This study provides additional support for the predictive value of individualized over population-level data in psychiatric populations. The Stability Index offers also a promising tool for generating insights about the impact of behavioral stability in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-020-00123-2"

The usual stuff commenting on what I was doing or watching and making me feel like I was on camera.I was convinced they were in the apt next door watching me on camera on a kind of a steak out. So one night my curiosity got the better of me I went outside to try and look in the windows, and I knocked on the door. I was just about to hop the balcony and go in the side door when the voices came to the conclusion that they were gonna send people to hang me because I was on to them.I freaked out. I rushed out to my car, When I went out side I got into my car and drove off but I forgot my phone inside. So, when I was Driving back I saw my old work colleagues car reversing out of the the apartments two doors down driveway. What do you think he was doing there? And At the exact moment I was heari

174354924,"It’s not perfect, complete or long. And I don’t think am going to finish it, so am just going to leave it here. UNDERSTANDING To begin your journey to heal from schizophrenia, it is important that you approach understanding from a sober perspective. Think of your brother or sister and examine what they think of the things you believe about your schizophrenia; for instance, do they really hear a voice in their head everytime voices are attured in your head? Ask them and forget about that feeling of ‘your neighbour or room mate is hearing your thoughts.’ Basically, from the perspective of a schizophrenia, understanding is to abandon all the stereotypes associated with schizophrenics ~ stop thinking you know best about the voices talking to your head and just listen to the reason and understanding of people like your brother or sister. However, It’s a common occurrence for most schizophrenics to find themselves in a situation where they have been hearing voices for so long that they start to 
reason and understand the world based on those voices ~ and this is where all the feelings of victimization come from. Without understanding from their voices perspectives, most schizophrenics would just be depressed people tired of hearing repeating voices in their thoughts, and that’s all their schizophrenia would be. They wouldn’t be fearful people, they wouldn’t feel like they’re victims of their friends, people or the government and they wouldn’t feel the need to isolate themselves from others and stop going to school or work. But, it is only natural for a person to stay away from the rational understanding that would prevent such beliefs from consuming them, and that is why it is important to fight your natural irrational understanding of your situation and accept the truth, and the truth is you’re mad with a medical\mental condition called schizophrenia. Now being mad isn’t an excuse to go around town and do crazy things like dancing naked in san _NAME_, but it is a reason to accept your 
situation and stop feeling the need to fight or defend yourself over these things of madness; Don’t say am not a bad person so I won’t accept these thoughts, just say your mad and let the thoughts exist without opposition. In short, don’t fight yourself over your thoughts, or feel a reason to be ashamed of your thoughts. Rather understand you are only hearing those thoughts or seeing those visions because you are mad with schizophrenia, and that should be the end of the situation. Never feel a need to justify yourself or fight others because of the voices you are hearing, just accept them as madness and that should be the end of the matter, whether you hear it a thousand times or one time, it is all just madness. We could go on and on talking about the reasons we should believe the madness of schizophrenia as true, but the reality of it is ~ those reasons are why you are mad. You could say, “but I see people talking to me about it?” Most likely you’ve also seen people in your television talking to 
you too. It’s simply madness and if you understand it from any perspective other than it being the things of madness, you would just be lying to yourself into a delusional understanding. So your first step towards getting healed should be abandoning everything you think you know about your schizophrenia; your voices and visions aren’t people talking to you (people you think are tormenting you with voices are just guys minding their own business and they have no idea of your situation or what you are doing or thinking. So forget about people, they are not witches or some sci fi government organisation ~ it is not them, it is only your madness. The truth is they’re all just like you before you became schizophrenic; they are just minding their own business, thinking about their own problems and talking to each other. Just because you hear them talking doesn’t mean they’re talking about you, that is just madness, so abandon that mindset of understanding). Also, your voices and visions aren’t spirits o
r ghosts of dead people trying to communicate with you (such things, spirits, they are not real. Abandon any notion you have of why they are spirits and just understand you are mad in schizophrenia and that is the only reason you hear voices speaking to you.) That said, it is important to try your best to ignore your voices and any understanding you have of them. Don’t listen to them, don’t consider them in your daily affairs and certainly don’t do something because they told you to do it, just follow your heart and do whatever you want in wisdom. It can be hard with strangers constantly trying to say something to you, so it’s important to understand the foundation of schizophrenia is an idea that you are receiving a message from somewhere, this can be from the TV talking to you, or music saying something to you, a secret letter in the newspapers or just a message from people talking to each other on the streets. So remember, everything you think you’re hearing from people or the TV is just from mad
ness that wants you to think your getting a message. So always remember, you are just mad and that is all it is. So always walk with understanding and you’ll be able to overcome the madness of always thinking about mad schizophrenic things like people are hearing my thoughts. If you ever feel overwhelmed by the voices or tempted to go back to your old way of thinking, just think about what your brother or sister would do? If you don’t have siblings, think about what your cousin would do. So leave the irrationality of schizophrenic understanding, and walk in understanding. **AWARENESS** Everytime you hear someone speak, as a schizophrenic, you usually hear them always saying something about you. Whether they are right next to you or just having a conversation outside your doorstep. So it’s important to be aware of this everytime you hear that voice coming from the distance through your window or that guy outside your door talking about you. So if you live in a noisy neighbourhood or a main street, it’s 
important that you make an effort to move out and go live somewhere quiet. If you don’t, you’ll just be frustrating your mind for no reason with listening to your neighbours talk to you through your schizophrenia. When you’re in a quiet place, you don’t have to struggle with those voices outside your window, so move out if people are constantly talking outside. As long as the voices are coming from a distance, you don’t have to hear them, those voices are just a product of the noise pollution coming from outside, they’re not like that voice in your head that won’t stop talking, they can stop talking, you just have to go somewhere where you don’t have to listen to them. So be aware of your surroundings and never tolerate listening to distant voices, always leave and go somewhere else. Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish the voices coming from your window are just a product of noise from people talking or someone playing loud music, or inaudible noises sounding like it’s saying something to y
ou. And without those people\noises, you just wouldn’t hear what they’re saying. Those voices don’t just magically appear, they need some sort of sound input, and as schizophrenics, our ears are usually so dull from hearing so much voices in our heads that out of that dullness of our ears, we always translate these sounds to be something about us. So get rid of them and your ears will have peace. And through that peace, you can open your mind\understanding to heal. In ancient times, schizophrenics would often be told to go live alone in a place without any people, and it acted as a sort of therapy that allowed them to think for themselves without caring about other people in their heads. So according to old knowledge on schizophrenia, if you can get rid of every single person around you, you’d probably get healed just by having no one to think about or listen to. Your voices would just stop making sense and you’d stop listening\hearing them. But that’s not a very practical solution in these modern 
times, unless you’re prepared to live like a hermit for one years. Anyways, you can limit the voices you hear and all you need to do is live somewhere quiet like a farm, or a cabin in the woods or just a really quiet neighbourhood, just find a place you can stay in touch with others while at the same time have peace of mind of not having to listen to that voice coming from your window, rooftop or from the neighbours house. So always have an awareness of how the noise around you affects your schizophrenia and recognize it as a product of schizophrenia and not someone outside trying to say something to you. So if you can move from your noisy neighbourhood, do so as soon as possible and you’ll notice the difference almost immediately. If you live in a noisy place and are unable to move out, it will be impossible to heal or have peace of mind, your mind will always be deranged from trying to make sense of the voices on the other side of your window and those noise will guarantee you’ll be hearing something 
in your head and that is the main reason most people never heal from schizophrenia for their mind never has space to think for itself. In fact, a famous psychologist once noted that the only people he studied who healed from schizophrenia were those who went home to live at home in the suburbs neighbourhood with their family during the early stages of their schizophrenia. However, the psychologist did not realize it was only because those people lived in quiet neighborhoods with their families and because of the silence, their minds were allowed to heal themselves, unlike other people whose minds are always broken down by the noises of their neighborhoods. So where you live matters and it can make the difference between being functional schizophrenic or living in a mental hospital."

174354945,"Went to church three times, the first time; the preacher told my to come back on tuesday and the nuns would help me (I thought he could just place his hands on my head, say a prayer or two and I would be healed), so I didn’t go back on Tuesday. The second time I went back to the same church and met a different preacher who gave me some type of water mixed with something and told me to drink it slowly overnight and tell him what happened the next day (I did as he said but it only magnified my schizophrenia symptoms, made them ten times worse) Next morning, I didn’t go back. The third time I went to a different church only this time I was telling the office secretary of the church that my schizophrenia originates from a bible verse Revelations 3: church of sardis, and like in the verse I was one of the soiled people, and I needed to speak to the preacher about it). I think they just assumed I was a crazy nutjob coz they told me to wait for the preacher to finish some wedding service he was doing, 
but after he was done, the had literally locked their office doors and their was no way to enter. Never went back since, but I always wonder what those nuns could have done or if that preacher who gave me the water could give me something else to make it less schizophrenic like his water made it more schizophrenic"

174354949,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Timing of menarche and abnormal hippocampal connectivity in youth at clinical-high risk for psychosis. _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Psychoneuroendocrinology, Apr 30 2020 The ""estrogen hypothesis"" suggests that estrogen is a protective factor against psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Although the precise protective mechanisms are still unclear, one potential explanation lies in the role that increased estrogens play in mediating hippocampal plasticity, as this may reduce hippocampal dysconnectivity that is characteristically observed in psychosis. In support of this view, later age at menarche- less available estrogen during critical early adolescent development- is related to earlier onset of psychosis and increased symptom severity. Furthermore, if estrogens have protective effects, then we should see this effect in the psychosis risk period in those at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis - i.e., individuals showing attenuated symptoms at imminent ris
k for transitioning to a psychotic diagnosis. This study examined whether earlier age at menarche would result in more normative hippocampal connectivity in CHR youth; menarche is an easily assessed, developmental marker associated with the availability of estrogens. Resting-state connectivity was examined in sixty female participants (26 CHR and 34 healthy control; age 12-21) using a cross-sectional approach; hippocampal connectivity was found to relate to age at menarche. Later age at menarche in the CHR group related to increased hippocampal dysconnectivity to the occipital cortex (a region with a neurotrophic response to estrogen) compared to the controls. Results suggest that earlier availability of estrogens may have neuroprotective effects on hippocampal plasticity. Findings have relevance for understanding sex differences and etiology, as well as guiding novel treatments."
176051349,I’m just miserable at my current job. Its not even the job it’s the management. We’ve had housekeepers complain about their workload. Not because it’s too much but because they’re lazy. Multiple people can verify this that their workload isn’t that bad. Management decided to lighten their load and add housekeepings to nurse aides like me who already have a lot of work. I hardly got out of work on time before this. They didn’t ask anybody and they didn’t tell anybody that they were doing this. They just started switching lists so that I showed up to work one day and found out I have a crazy amount of extra work to do. The past about 2 weeks I have gotten out about 2 hours late every single day. They don’t tell us when a thing changes they don’t even tell us when we get a new resident. Their services just suddenly pop up on our list. They make changes without consulting the people who actually have to try to make the changes work. I just feel bad because I told them I’d be here t
hrough the summer until school starts. Plus I just got a pay raise and I feel like I’d just be wasting it. I haven’t fully decided of I’m gonna quit or not.

176051355,"Her dog that she had for 15 years died just about 6 or 7 months ago. I loved her dog, she was cute and friendly and affectionate and full of energy. My sister grieved for awhile but she got a new dog about 4 months ago. This new dog is nothing like my sisters old dog. My sister is cute and outgoing and bubbly and young looking even at age 61. And so her and her old dog were a perfect match. This poor new dog is frightened of everybody. He is friendly to my sister and maybe loving but I’ve been seeing him for four months now and he is scared of me and the rest of the family and strangers. I have never showed anything but friendliness and patience with the new dog but every time I see him he just cowers and never wags his tail. It’s obvious that he was mistreated by someone down the line but this is the most dog-loving family you will meet and no one had been anything but kind to him. I am housesitting now and it’s a small apartment and he is cowering in the corner by himself even though I have 
gone out of my way to be kind and non-threatening. He is so unlike my sisters previous dog. but the family can’t say anything. My sister sees how he is around us but she is in denial and thinks he will get better but after zero change for 4 months it’s obvious he will not get better and my sister is committed to keeping him. So she might have him for the next 10 or 15 years. I go out of my way to be friendly and pet him and put him at ease but I am tired of walking on eggshells around him to make sure I don’t scare him. To me, the whole purpose of dogs are to be friendly and be there to be petted and played with. There is none of those things in him. I’m not trying to be mean or heartless but my sister will never give him up because they have a bond but I can see this situation could cause trouble in the family."

It’s normal to get stuck along the way a few times, you just have to be patient and keep doing the right things, then the weight loss will start again. It’s hard to wait, but just keep with the program! I don’t exercise either, and I am down a total of 80 pounds. You can lose with diet alone, and you’re in the right calorie range for it. Good luck with the Whole 30! I never took my measurements when I first started losing, so that’s a moot point now, but I like to weigh in every Saturday morning Waiting a full month would be hard! _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ Slow is what keeps the weight off long-term! Just keep making one more healthy decision and it adds up! And frozen blackberries sound YUM!

I almost think some have figured out they are not crazy and can mess with the rest of us to where we all believe we are crazy instead. They will make others see what we see to where they can control us as in our own body sometimes the strong ones can make us move and do things against our will. If we are telepathic then the voices in our heads that don’t sound like us are someone else and we are all confused yelling at each other threatening each other and it only gets worse.

The reptilians want to keep us all at a lower vibration ( pain and suffering ) they get off on it especially the suffering of children and that’s why the elite run pedophile networks _NAME_ was just the tip of the ice berg. Ultimately the goal is to create an AI general intelligence and then connect it to the human brain so he elite can become super human and live for ever.

176051439,"There are some other impairing possibilities to consider here. I had a period in my life where my energy plummeted while i was working full time. As far as I can tell there were two reasons for this. The first one was that I had a really bad diet at the time. I mostly ate junkfood and didn’t change up my diet. I ate the same stuff all the time so I got very little nutrition and probably had several nutrition defects. The other thing is I sat infront of a monitor the whole working day doing computer stuff. This drained me for energy. I am hypersensitive to radiation from monitors. If I spend more than 1 hour infront of my mobile my head starts to get debilitated, even when using blue light filter. It’s not so bad with TV, I think this is because there is a much greater distance between myself and the monitor, and also because TV is passive action while computer stuff is often active action. So try eating healthy and varied, and dare yourself to have a couple of days off the internet and see what 
happens. You can always find something else to do like listening to audiobooks. I like that you contribute on the forum, but if you spend a lot of time on your mobile that might actually be the culprit that is taking your energy, so you got to look after yourself even if it means doing stuff that seems really hard. Internetuse/addiction is a habit that very many people are struggling with, many even without knowing it, because they don’t perceive it as a problem. If you are sensitive to radiation from monitors, computers and mobiles are not your friend. I have a app installed that allows me to spend a maximum of 4,5 hours a day right now, on the web, this is really useful to get things under control and get used to spending less time online."

Even a 100% correlation, positive or negative, doesn’t prove causation: Also, every medication has a number needed to treat (NNT), and a number needed to harm (NNH). We’re looking for the absolute risk, not a percentage of risk (you can’t have a percentage of a person). Ideally, a NNT would be 1. An example of a NNT of 1 would be this: we have 200 people in an airplane flying at 15,000 feet. Our control group is 100 people, and our treatment group is 100 people. Our control group will jump out of the airplane (we’re going to assume they all die), and our treatment group will jump out of the airplane with a parachute (we’re going to assume they all live). So the NNT is 1, and the NNH is 0 (1/0). The NNT is 1."

176051524,"In my country, doctors like to give medication shock therapy when you get hospitalized with psychosis. They inject you like a drug mixture of massive dose quatepine, haldol, risperidone, nitrozepam and valium (I’m not kidding) the night before I was hospitalized I had 2 energy drinks and 2 strongest pre-workouts and I also was full blown manic. That injection put me asleep in 2 minutes and I realized the next day afternoon that I am sitting in a hospital hall which was after 2 days. Doctors lie on their script how much they give you meds. They told on the report that they gave me 5mg haldol and 3mg risperidone daily, which wasn’t true. I was put on reality for 20mg haldol and 6mg risperidone daily with extra haldol shots when they get pissed off with my constant walking in the halls. Welcome to Lithuania I guess…"

I occasionally sing or rap over them. The show is at a brewery, I’ve never performed there, I got special permission to do so. It pays!!!

He worked at my clinic and at a drug addiction clinic. He treated every mental patient like they were drug addicts, including making every patient do a piss test before each session. He’s fired now, but I only saw him once, he was such a jerk. My current pdoc is a nice, caring, grandfather type."

Even she said, that I should stop taking more meds. I guess there are some things which can be helped otherwise, not only with meds… But who else got better even though, that the meds were not a big help either for him/her too?

174354998,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov What Do People With Schizophrenia Do All Day? Ecological Momentary Assessment of Real-World Functioning in Schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _NAME_, _PERSON_, PC Link, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and PD _NAME_, Schizophrenia bulletin , Aug 23 2019 Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability worldwide. As new treatments for functioning are tested, the need grows to demonstrate real-world functioning gains. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may provide a more ecologically valid measure of functioning. In this study, smartphone-based EMA was used to signal participants with schizophrenia (N = 100) and controls (N = 71) 7 times a day for 7 days to respond to brief questionnaires about social interactions and functioning behaviors. Excellent adherence was found, with both groups completing an average of 85% of surveys and only 3% of participants with schizophrenia excluded for poor adherence. Four-week test-retest reliability was high (r = .83 for total productive behaviors). Relative to c
ontrols, participants with schizophrenia reported significantly less total productive activity (d = 1.2), fewer social interactions (d = 0.3), more nonproductive behaviors (d = 1.0; watching TV, resting), and more time at home (d = 0.8). Within the schizophrenia group, participants living independently showed better functioning on EMA relative to participants in supported housing (d = 0.8) and participants engaged in vocational activities showed better functioning than individuals not engaged in vocational activities (d = 0.55). Modest correlations were found between EMA and an in-lab self-report measure of functioning activities performed in the community, but not between EMA and measures of functional capacity or potential. This study demonstrated the feasibility, sensitivity reliability, and validity of EMA methods to assess functioning in schizophrenia. EMA provides a much-needed measure of what individuals with schizophrenia are actually doing in real-world contexts. These results also suggest that there 
may be important disjunctions between indices of abilities and actual real-world functioning."

Ive been smoking for like 15 years tried chantax like 8 years ago made me hear voices, this was before i was diagnosed which was four years ago. but anyway i tried quitting a few times most i succeeded was four months but was still smoking cigars daily. but with this stuff its like hindering my cravings so im much less dependent on the nicorette alternatives. pretty stokes. you gotta actually want to quit tho. idk i honestly love smoking but it grosses me out most of the time"

176051636,"Coronavirus in your country (UK) is very low. Only two cases right now, right? Very low risk. Probably panic attacks or the vaping device. Also, this is just me suggesting, but do you have problems breathing at night? Like sleep apena or apena in general? I’m having a problem with breathing these days and my brother’s starting to pick up my subtle changes in breathing."
174355020,Yes. Or at least up to now. That’s why my dx is psychotic disorder rather than sza In UK 5mg is considered therapeutic dose at least in my mental health team

176051638,"I am not a Dr, better ask your Dr about it but I believe there is meds like Benzatropine for these? In most cases I think they’re not permanent. I had eyelid tremors and akathisia, they disappeared after changing AP and after reducing dosage."
176051639,I had this guy who did me wrong. I was upset. I would drive by his house often and think of him. I started praying for him and realized the sign on his house for his home based business was truly of artistic quality. That kind of helped me get out of the drivers seat. _PERSON_

Some sort of time travel is going on and more. Personally, I think we live in a computer program now. Worst thing is I cannot change my past and undo the schizophrenia. Feels like aliens are doing it, but I don’t know. I also thought _NAME_s Book on Kindle/Amazon, which I own. The title is self-explanatory."
174355031,I can understand being triggered. Watching the news and horror movies now triggers me even though before the onset of my schizophrenia I really enjoyed horror movies. Meds haven’t been able to cure that fear
176051650,"I have two voices in my head - Alien the evil spirit and _NAME_ the good spirit. Alien demeans me and threatens me and calls me a hypocrite and liar. Inserts his thoughts in my head. Tries to control me. _NAME_ defends me against _PERSON_ and tells me everything will be ok and don’t listen to _PERSON_. She also talks with _PERSON_, telling him to leave me alone."

176051653,"I was alone for 27 years, besides seeing someone briefly and only kissing. I made a terrible mistake getting involved with someone over 3 years ago, because he did not really care about me and I didn’t feel the same, soon after. I would much rather have not gotten involved with anyone, than getting involved with the wrong person."
176051654,"Know its not easy, but maybe your better off quietly ignoring them then, and remaining “emotionally flat” about them. The more your reacting - the worse they get. _PERSON_ what drugs your on - but maybe ask for a prn dose. Doc gave me 25mg Quetiapine for “psychotic anxiety” to take thru the day ontop of the 300mg at night. Its just enough to knock em out, but not put me to sleep all day."

176051659,Hi _AT_MENTION_ . Nice to meet u too
176051660,I haven’t taken a shower in about a week but my motivation level has been very low lately. You can do this _AT_MENTION_!
176051661,"I’m cheating on my diet and gaining weight, though I still lift the weights. One issue is the meds, I think they can make me hungry, though they might not be doing so, as such I convince myself it’s an excuse and proceed to eat the wrong foods On a more positive note, learned some new stretches as well as exercises. I’ve been making blueberry smoothies. According to a video on youtube by eliott hulse, there are exercises you need for all around strength… Deadlifts, dips, front squats and chin-ups, I tried a front squat w/my dumbells and It really straightened out my posture. Interesting! As muscles for my core and upper body which had been out of balance woke up from dormancy Still the scale is rising, I’m back to eating cheese and bread, I drink milk and hardly measure anything. I’m not sure if pounds of “muscle” are muscle if they’re just a “pump”. Anyhow, Importantly, I would like to get started jogging again, but temperatures are subzero My foot still hurts, and last week 
I resolved to give it what I would consider to be a necessary month or more of long rest"

176051663,I honestly can’t remember how many it’s been. I’m a recovered drug addict who used to drink a lot and party all the time and I have impulse control issues due to the mania from bi-polar disorder and I just can’t remember. Isn’t that awful?
176051664,I have mine. had it since I was like 17
176051665,Oh I’m so sorry you are going through this. It’s hardest on the kids I’m sure.

176051672,Phones glitch sometimes. Mine sometimes plays the wrong tone also.
174355043,"The media in Korea might be similar to the media in the U.S. It seems the only time a schizophrenic is in the news here is when they commit a mass murder like shooting up a school or a mall or a movie theater or something. Or when they commit the (rare) gruesome crime. Other than that, they are rarely in the news. When those crimes occasionally occur, the press sensationalizes them and unfortunately, this is how the general public forms their opinions on mental illness or on schizophrenics in general. It’s a problem here in the U.S. too. Are schizophrenics committing a lot of crime where you live? Because you kind of make it sound like there’s a big problem with schizophrenics in your country. Are they in the news that often? Boy, it’s sure too bad that you think like that. It’s too bad you do that to yourself. Your life would probably improve if you got rid of those thoughts. Real _USER_ID_ by other people is bad enough but to take on that huge burden of somehow feeling responsible or bad 
for things you had nothing to do with must be a huge weight on your shoulders. I can relate a little because there have been a few instances at work where I look at my fellow mentally ill co-workers and wince when they have done certain things and I think, “That’s part of the reason why so-called “normal” people have such a poor opinion of us.” That’s rare that happens though. I think you can see how faulty your thinking is. It’s too bad you can’t change the way you think regarding other schizophrenics. When you read or hear those stories those schizophrenics make us look bad to the public which leads to _USER_ID_ but it’s not your fault and you are not responsible for the actions of other schizophrenics and you didn’t do anything wrong. That’s what it all boils down to: you are taking the worlds problems upon your shoulders. The sad part is no one is forcing you to, and you don’t have to."
176051673,"If a delusion comes naturally just like the sun on your face, you have not the doubt to ask anyone if it’s true or not . You don’t even think about it. It never crosses your mind."
176051674,"WHen I feel guilty It feels gross but I just wait it out. It usually only lasts 6-12 hours. To deal with it, I tell myself it’s good I feel remorse as this tells me I have a conscious and am not a sociopath."
176051675,I was actually thinking about a standard poodle or a golden doodle!
176051676,Wow this is the best news!! Congrats _AT_MENTION_ !
176051677,"Yes SSRI can bring these as it can suppress dopamine activity. Dopamine is needed in required levels to have motivation, drive, energy etc."
176051678,I used to be on shots decades ago when I was non-compliant with meds. This helped get me stable enough that I developed the insight to (mostly) stay on meds. The few times I have gone off were when I was on meds with frustrating side-effects. I’m very happy that Geodon works for me and that the side-effects are next to nothing now.
176051679,"Anxiety- Not sure of which type but PTSD, SAD, and major anxiety are all possible. high blood pressure diabetes periodic depression morbid obesity. plantar fasciitis"

174355039,"I’ve read a lot of posts here that Abilify is not so potent treating SZ, but does not cause crippling depression. The lack of motivation you will experience will be almost on every Anti-psychotic medication. One of Abilify drawbacks are increased impulsivity, restlessness and akathisia"
176051681,Yeah but what if the meds don’t help
176051682,Sz has not seemingly affected your sense of humour.
176051683,"One more note. I also started taking fish oil and vitamin D because I’m not in the sun as much since I started working nights. My nurse recommended the fish oil. I found a 300 ct bottle combo pill for 18 bucks! It’s a burpless version with lots of omega 3s. That could be helping me a bunch too already. Looking forward to not being in denial anymore about my depression. And fixing it with the help of proper medication. I do think counseling would be a good addition. Only thing is my schedule is pretty crazy. I work 3rd shift and sometimes 10 days in a row. I thought about paying for a 24/7 counselor but I just don’t have the money. Any ideas, anyone? I suppose I could just schedule for my days off?"
176051684,What’s ur goals?
176051685,"Do you work up a good sweat when you work out lifer? Maybe the exercise your doing isn’t enough to get the endorphins going and make you feel good about life again. Saying that the hospital is a safe place and food is reasonable I drive there sometimes but I always end up feeling glad that I’m not stuck in there with voices. There’s Such a big world outside the hospital, I used to think that the voices were real and that world would never be mine but it turns out the voices were not real so anything is possible"

176051690,They are quite beautiful.
176051691,I usually only shower once or twice a week. Trying to brush teeth more often but still lacking in that department. Sometimes wear same clothes two or three days. Pants I usually wear for a week. Then when I shower I change them
176051692,"Hmm?. Sorry…, I Was Jus Tryin To Cheer You Up. Black Magic Is Kinda Like A Self Fulfilling Prophecy. There Was A Book By The Guy _NAME_ Called ‘Prometheus Rising’. . . Where He Talked About A Quarter On The Ground If You Find Yourself Walking Down The Road. If You Are Looking For Quarters Your Chance Of Finding One Is Higher Than If You’re Not Looking For One. Kinda Like Your Fear Of Black Magic. It’s A Self Fulfilling Prophecy. Look For It You May Find It. Although, My Personal Spiritual Beliefs Disagree. It May Be Something With Some Truth.

176051693,"I think I relapsed. I’m actually 100% sure that I did. The shadows are back. They are covering their ears repeatedly. I begged them to not come back. I’ve been wiping spiders off of my arms for a while. They’re still here nonetheless. The voices want me dead. They want me to kill myself and tear my skin out. I am just so paranoid and worn out I feel like a failure. I need to tell my mom that I need to be back on my meds but I’m sure she’s going to constantly ask me like a thousand questions. I’m still psychotic but thank you to one of the members here that helped me out tonight. You saved me. I’m going to make sure that I don’t tear things out. I’ve been having hallucinations over and over again. As I was screaming in my mind I suddenly felt the heart pain- the sharp throbbing pain when I am really stressed out. I just want to drown. I am so sorry, you guys. I have failed you. I have burdened you. I have absolutely burdened you."

I gained so much weight because I can’t go out and the medicine. This medicine isn’t helping me the main thing I’m paranoid about I’m still paranoid about. I have no relief.

176051717,I find that I am VERY bad at dealing with stress. Even a little bit puts me in a strange mood.
176051718,"I’m no longer on medication but I was for several months, so I can tell from experience. I was on chlorpromazine for about 6-8 months. Yes. I had them even while I was medicated. My voices normally do not sound like real voices. For me, they typically like to sound like some other sound I am currently hearing. It’s as if it is modulating or overlaying to the source sound. For example if I’m walking then the voice talks in the rhythm of my footsteps and it sounds like the footsteps, and then the voice seems to come from my feet (exactly where the sound of the footsteps comes from). If scratching my hand the voice sounds like scratching, etc. If there is no appropriate sound around it “modulates” the silence; then I cannot tell where the voice comes from. Sometimes I get a voice that has a gender and is more like a sound on its own, but it’s still not like a real voice, and it sounds as if coming from my head or slightly above it. The medication did not affect the voices in any way."

176051721,I like watching documentaries on WW1 and WW2. It’s a reflection of our past and I think it’s important for people to understand history as to know how we can prevent things like that happening to future generations. I think it’s important and should be taught in school.

176051745,I think that’s exactly what they are. The so called illuminati.
176051746,thanks
176051747,"Back in about 1992 I had a friend at my board & care. Nice guy, really funny, cool to hang around. One day he came up to me all excited and showed me a leaflet. _PERSON_ was going to be at this local church. _PERSON_ was huge in the sixties. “Tears of a Clown”, “Tracks of my Tears”. Him and his band had several hits and he’s kind of a legend in the music world. My friend wanted to go see him so we ate dinner, took our meds and figured out how to get to the church on a bus. I think the flyer said _PERSON_ started out at 7:00 pm. We got there and the church was packed. And _PERSON_ walked out on stage—and gave a 60 minute talk about being a born again Christian. He didn’t sing one song; he just talked. It was actually pretty boring and we felt cheated even though the talk was free. We kinda laughed about the experience later but we were pretty mad at the time."
176051748,"I thought I had mild or beginnings of cotards syndrome and solipsism syndrome from being in outer space too long like on Mars and the moon. Don’t know or could care less. Getting better. Solipsism shouldn’t matter unless it’s pathological and causes psychological distress then it should be treated with therapy and perhaps medication. Unfortunately, APs can and sometimes increase DP/DR and increase dissociation which increases solipsism and it never really heals until you get the anxiety under control, accept the way things are philosophically, and move on, and stop ruminating, etc."
174355056,What was you thinking like previously? I havent been thinking straight for like a year
176051749,Call your doctor! That might be TD.
176051750,he dont remember at all what meds he gave to me and caused to me problems so he become not focused he just dont care much but he helped me pass through hard times and helped me graduate college but now i feel him not so good maybe i return to him and may be not
176051751,"Doesn’t matter. They’re gonna hold you as long as they see fit. Apparently, you’re still not stable enough to leave (threatening to kill your doc). So yeah, might as well get comfortable."
176051752,I have paranoia that everywhere I go people are using witchcraft on me… I also think the world is ending and I’m terrified because I lived a ‘sinful’ life … However God became an obsession and I’m so tired of thinking of him all day and I’m tired of kicking my rear end when I screw up…

176051754,Thats what I’m trying to do _AT_MENTION_
176051755,Booze will just make you get up and piss half the night on the toilet - and you wont get any REM sleep off it either. Try a relaxing bath - and try to wind down a couple of hours beforehand - like some easy reading and low lights on or some nice tunes.
174355058,Since starting aripiprazole I have a much better sleep schedule. Previously I’d sleep at random times. Has anyone else had this benefit?
176051756,Do you want to make $783 a month? Do you not care if attractive people ignore you? Would you like to live in poverty for life? Have you applied for SSI but been rejected? Do you want that headache of a kid who can’t hold down a job be taken care of? Have they rejected her? Well get me as your lawyer. I’ll fix you right up because the US government is made up of lawyers who created the system where you need a lawyer to do it. And the government won’t have to put you or your kid in the unemployment statistics. (Good luck getting off it though). Call me now at 1-800- you-lose.
176051757,"Frankly, it’s what people say about me (well, not directly but to like…people with my disease altogether). It’s also told a lot to people with down syndrome. It’s based on eugenic ideas; given the fact that genetic diseases can happen by genetic mutations, they believe that the “weak” must be eliminated to prevent further spread of genetic mutations. But you can’t really stop that. No one knows who carries what genetic mutation. It’s just basically saying nonsense. A completely normal person can have a mutation but show no signs."
176051758,I take vitamin b complex plus an antidepressant. It helps me. It’s worth a try
176051759,they called me 6 months ago to see if i would come back and i said no. i really just wanted the girl who called to be my friend. and she is very nice but she doesn’t want to be my friend it was more or less to see if i would come back. Good _PERSON_ i say.
174355054,"For me personally it has gotten better,i first got schizophrenia in 1995 at 20 years of age, i am now 45 years old, it is a very very hard illness to cope with at tmes but clozaril has been a game changer for me!"
174355057,Any side effects? Clozapine didn’t like me so I went into the oldie perphenazine now
176051760,"I love cooking and I am very skilled and creative, but you just can’t replace the taste of grilling and who doesn’t love a nice thick steak? Besides, I’m hoping my heart kills me before I wind up a mindless zombie like my father-in-law. _PERSON_’s brain was gone some years back, but his body is still rattling around in a diaper. Pass the bacon."
176051761,They say iam going to hell forever for smoking when they sublimely told me to
176051762,"Full blown thought reset, only thing that helps me. This is what I do when I feel my thinking being over focused Identify the obsessive thoughts for what it is Find what the thought is trying to tell me ID the trigger, be it a stressor I need to work on, the media I’m ingesting, or my stemming from myself Remove the trigger, be it a change of scenario, stopping my research, or actively checking my thoughts and inserting different topics until I focus on them instead. Repeat until it becomes a habit. but mind your thought patterns don’t swing into alternation deficits. Hope it helps you like it helps me EH. It’s work, but doing those help me"
176051763,Also I read somewhere that it is not paranoia if someone you know does not stop talking to you even if you told them that was what you wanted. I once told my boyfriend that I wanted to end the relationship but later said he didn’t get the e-mail. What if my boyfriend is setting me up and I end up in North Korea because of him?
176051764,"It won’t really make you feel better to tear things up. If you need some kind of physical release, try exercise or tear up old, unneeded papers or punch a pillow. If you can afford one, buy a punching bag, hand it up and have at it."
176051765,instead of being angry and confused.
176051766,You’ve perfectly described me. On the one hand I want change but on the other hand it’s almost as if I’m afraid of it.
176051767,"no mate, sorry but you used up all your turns so well done but you are out for now"
176051768,What med r u on ?
176051769,They warned me last time so I think it’s going to happen
176051770,"SSRI should be taken on The Day, and they can worsen your symtoms."
176051771,"i tried it for sleep, only 25mg and after a few days of taking it, it gave me major aggression and bad thoughts. my gf even said i woke up in the middle of the night once and said something angrily too her then went back to sleep which i have no memory of. so i discontinued it right away."
176051772,Up to a point. Once you have an idea what the problem is you also have an obligation to try and fix it.
176051773,I’m picking up my paycheck today.
176051774,"i was driving with a friend once, and we saw this weird cloud ball right in front of us in the middle of the street, then it went right through the car. We were freaked the feck out. both of us saw it. we just drove straight home. lol thats the only time i was ever freaked out by the idea of a ghost. ive seen weird ghoul like creatures run up the stairs in my home but more in my minds eye like an intrusive image but I can feel and sense it, makes the hair on my neck stand up."
176051775,"_AT_MENTION_, I’ve been listening to more black metal lately, especially underground bands. What bands do you suggest? I already really like Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Batushka, and I just started listening to Wolves in the Throne Room. I don’t really like Mayhem, though."
176051776,I’ve always been really aware of how badly young boys need positive masculine role models. I’m sorry for your troubles. That kind of thing hurts.
176051777,Do what others want? Or do what you want? Where do you draw The line of happiness?
176051778,No not physically. I feel as if I’m constantly tied up in invisible restraints and it’s really uncomfortable and makes my body feel twisted. I don’t know who did this to me but it’s not ok but because the restraints are invisible I can’t talk about it. I think my mum is in on it and she could be the one who did it even but I’m not sure who tied me up but it’s not ok. I woke up this morning to feel tied up. I’m upset about it but I can’t free myself.
176051779,I don’t follow it since having sz but I was following it a little before sz.
176051780,"Nice video. I take lamictal too. When I went up to 400mg from 200, I went toxic and couldn’t make eye contact with people. I also got photosensitive and my hair started falling out."
176051781,"You’re fine! You’re free to post about your troubles here too. This is just kind of a rambling thread of mine lol and anyone is welcome to interject. That sucks that you didn’t really get much help at the hospital. You’d think they’d look at your meds, at least. Agreed, treatment is not an easy thing. It takes a lot out of you. The future is scary! I have a lot of anxiety regarding my loved ones’ well-being. And my own life is kind of a coin toss at this point."
176051782,Trazodone mirtazapine and a couple benadryl if I need it. Benadryl is cheap and it really works for me.

174355061,So I’m not compliant with my medications as my head will give me reasons to not take them and I get paranoid about taking them cuz I look at them as like they are a poison to my brain that they’re only going to debilitate me more. So this is my second time of trying Risperdal before I get the Risperdal consta shot which will make me more mad compliant. I had the same results as I did the first time I tried Risperdal which is atrocious nightmares! And when I say atrocious I don’t say that lightly. I had a dream I was with my cousin who has caused a lot of Chaos in my life and she was causing more chaos. We were running around trying to shoot up drugs at some point she put my arm in a shark tank and the shark bit off my arm up to my shoulder. Then I was running around trying to find someone to reattach it. I had another dream the following night that my husband had cheated on me with my best friend and I was watching and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Then the following night after tha
t I had a dream that I was homeless and I was sleeping in a box that was kind of like a parade float but yet I was sleeping on the ground inside of it it was weird. I had people banging on the sides of the walls trying to attack me. I do have nightmares normally but this was way worse. Years ago I had been stable on Abilify for quite a few years taking it orally and that isn’t even when my schizophrenia was brought out of my brain. Or maybe it was covering my symptoms then and & I didnt know yet. So tomorrow is my pdoc appointment and I’m asking to get the maintena
174355066,"I’m supposed to be switching from abilify to caplyta, But I’m not sure if I’ll actually do it. My doctor says it’s very similar, just causes less weight gain."
174355062,"This is so so scary in my country. I was so so horrified. I was going to post an issue regarding _USER_ID_ against schizophrenics in South Korea, but I was afraid that it will trigger delusions. The provincial council was thinking of putting protective measures against people with schizophrenia, and that includes me. I seriously thought it was a delusion, but my mom was telling me on a walk with my dogs and I was even able to find a news article about it. I was horrified. It wasn’t a delusion but a real thing. It was a real-life nightmare. The provincial council was heavily criticized and the plan was withdrawn. I’m sickened by their approach to us. What did we do?? I’m a normal university student who just happens to have this illness. What do you expect of me? Urgh."
176051785,"It is a long time since I started medication. When I started medication, I had highly intelligent, highly educated, well meaning people who knew and cared about me tell me I didn’t need medication. They were so wrong! I work very hard at this point in my life not to get separated from my meds."
176051786,To whom you respond? I believed they are hallucinations
176051787,Why not gripe to both
176051788,My mother died in 2010. She was the best person I knew. I’ve heard her. Your mother may be with you. You wouldn’t want to upset her.

176051790,Go for it. Maybe seek out a better location. I used to play out on a street where people like to do bar crawls. I’d put a few coins and $1s in my guitar case and I’d usually get some tips. I would promote my bands upcoming shows too. Good times.

174355067,"hi everyone, new to this forum, new to the disorder. so the basics of my situation, I woke up from what felt like a shared dream with the belief that I had become telepathic with someone. they can hear my thoughts, a few other unimportant beliefs I no longer believe, they can also reply to me but I cant hear their thoughts. after ten days I had enough went to a holistic doctor and followed her advice to stay in the real world and I ignored it and it was gone. two weeks later I was lonely and I sat down and concentrated and brought it back. that all happened in January. I was diagnosed around February with a schizophrenic psychosis. its now the middle of july and I have been hearing it almost nonstop except for one week in wich I worked four 8 hour shifts in a row, silent at work little bit noisy when I would go to sleep. if anyone has any ideas on how to make it go away again or some advice or even just the reinforcement that I am not telepathic and it is made up in my head would be great! im looki

176051792,"My doctor was more interested in keeping me working than caring about my well being. I was trying to cut down on zyprexa and was basically down to 2,5mg so that I would be able to work full time. The only problem was I got insomnia and slept like 3 hours on average for over 3 years. I was on the wrong track, and I didn’t see it myself, because I thought the insomnia would dissapear at some point. But it didn’t. I got more and more desperate as my health was going south, and the doctor did not stress that I needed to take more drugs to get sleep. Luckily I came to the decision to change doctor. First thing the new doctor says to me: “We got to help you sleep”. Upped my dose to 10mg… If I hadn’t changed doctor I’m 100% convinced I would be dead now."

I give what I want, when I want and all her manipulation is just entertainment to see what she comes up with next. It is a thing of beauty to see her lie, what skill she has.

176051864,"I don’t know, it might not be the medication and might be elsewhere that’s triggering some of those symptoms, As above, try to keep at the medication for as long as possible. When you are absolutely CERTAIN you’ve developed stress management in your mind and have tested yourself in situations , then after that it could be worth coming off of But even so, anything could trigger a relapse and nobody wants that for you, I’d say read up as much as you can on how medication works, or science (and also psychology) to a level you can grasp how well you can fight psychotic break through symptoms or trigger situations so that you can be medication free Two facts: Genetics change in the body as we live Stress management is a skill that can be developed by resilience (resilience is recently being researched as a means of sz recovery) All the best"

176051873,I think here in the US going to school or working after being diagnosed can hurt you. They best time to apply is right after you get sick and dont go back to school or work. I was involuntarily hospitalized for three months and if course I got disability the first try no lawyer. When you have that happen you are not gonna be denied.

176051910,That’s amazing. You’ve got a mega talent !
176051911,I was psychotic so they were a bit more intense for sure. Meds will flatten them out for sure but depends how long you’ve been on them. Although you get receptor occupancy from the first 24 hours it can take like 4-6 weeks to see credible results. It’s not an easy process and it takes time over anything else. Just relax. Take the pills and do some exercise if you can.

174355112,"First of all, welcome to the forum. Lots of cool people here. Lots of people work after being diagnosed. And incidentally many people with schizophrenia get married or go to college or have kids or travel or work out a gym or own pets etc. In fact most things that so called “normal people” (non-schizophrenics) are doing, there are schizophrenics somewhere in the world doing it too. I got my first job at age 17 before I got diagnosed. I worked pretty steadily at many jobs after that until I got diagnosed at age 19. I went into my first psyche ward and then I lived in a group home for a year. Following that was an 8 month hospitalization where I suffered terribly because I was psychotic during my entire stay. After the hospital was another group home but at age 23 I became employed again and have been almost steadily employed since then. My father instilled in me a liking for physical labor jobs so most of jobs were various labor jobs like unloading trucks which I excelled in. I’ve also stocked 
shelves in various department stores (not too rough), spent three years at HP recycling materials and moving furniture (I excelled at that too). I was a park ranger for a couple of years. I’ve been at my current janitor job for 5 years. Every person experiences schizophrenia differently. There’s things we have in common but schizophrenia is like a snowflake, no two people are exactly alike. People handle stress differently. Stick around here and you will see what is possible for a schizophrenic to do. Most of my jobs have been entry level jobs with no experience necessary. I get along with people but I’m not really a people person so you won’t find me doing sales work or cashiering or doing jobs like you have. I can’t tell you what to do, I don’t know your personality or your strengths and weaknesses. Personally, I got my first job after my hospitalization only because a counselor thought I could do it. I wasn’t looking for a job and I didn’t ask for the job but a counselor thought I could do 
it so she recommended it to me so I tried it and I lasted four years. My point here is that sometimes others can see something in us that we can’t see ourselves. If that counselor had not encouraged me I might not have became employed for another two or three years. And my personal experience is that almost everybody has some kind of potential. I’ve worked while psychotic, I’ve worked jobs while I was addicted to crack, I’ve worked jobs while depressed or physically ill. I’ve worked at jobs for years that I hated but I needed the money so I bit the bullet and just stayed with it. IDK if you should change fields, maybe your stress is temporary or might become more manageable. My personal opinion is that almost any job is respectable. I think labor jobs are respectable. I will take any job that hires me. I hope you got something from this. I’m 58 now and this is my experience. Good luck."

Im thinking to ask to quit quetiapine or reduce the dose to 100mg at night. Is this a wise choice? Does 200mg quetiapine works as AP or just as a sleeping pill?"

176052000,"What is the brand name of perphenazine? I couldn’t sit still on Prolixin. I had to be up walking. They took me to this assisted living center, and put me in a room where about thirty people were sitting at these tables watching a western movie. I could not sit still, and this woman kept trying to make me sit still. I wasn’t disrespecting her. I just could not sit still. I ate supper at that place, and then I walked out on the highway and tried to hitch hike. I didn’t get any rides, so I had to walk eight miles to the next town. Then walking through the town was a good three miles. I got a ride at about 1:00 am, and I got dropped off at this post office. I rested there a couple of hours, and then I started walking again. At sunrise these guys picked me up. They wanted me to do some roofing with them. Before long the main guy saw that the sun was killing me. (Because of the med’s.) He said he’d give me a full day’s wages if I would carry these ten bundles of shingles up this ladder and on
to the roof of this house. I did that, and he dropped me off in Keota, Oklahoma. I had thirty dollars in my pocket. I was getting in trouble from the sun. I got rides though. I got to _PERSON_ and I found this dug out in a peewee baseball park. I rested there in the shade for about three hours. Then I got back out on the road and stuck my thumb out. I made it to Porum at about 12:00 am. I quit getting rides on the highway. I walked all night into Muskogee. That evening I crawled up onto the steps of the Gospel Rescue Mission, and a hot shower and a soft bed never felt so good. I guess I got to walk as much as I wanted."
176052001,I feel you man. I too used to be in shape. Meds have made me gain about 45 lbs. Curiosity…were you a pot user too? You do not have to answer if you do not wish

176052007,Geodon I couldn’t sit still. Nvethless.i think you have a good group of meds
176052008,It’s not a short process. Without the intervention of the medication your probably looking at bigger losses than just a break from reality is my point.
176052009,"Though after 18 and reaching adult life, environment doesnt play much any role in life. Its the first 18 years of our life that shape our personality, life, etc My broken sz genes are preventing me from living my life that was shaped during the first 18 years of my life."
176052010,Yea no problem.
176052011,Depression really sucks for me so getting that right was a big battle that took a long time but worthwhile in the long run. Sedation is common on antipsychs. They are derived from the major tranqualizers so there’s always that. Antidepressants can sometimes be activating and give you energy. I take mine in the mornings.

176052014,"You are not responsible, and you have nothing to take accountability for. This was the actions of opportunists, and rapists. These people think they can take what they want, and often they get away with it. I don’t know why you were expected to think like this, and whether it actually has any value in terms of how you might come to terms with it, but to me it just seems like the wrong way to think about this. You were a victim, and it doesn’t matter if you were wearing certain clothes, or willingly went into a basement, you were forcibly attacked and that is not acceptable. It takes a while to get over this kind of thing, but it is possible to move on. I wish I knew how I did. I went psychotic before because of this kind of thing happening, and ever since being medicated it has been at the back of my mind, but it does surface now and again. You have to remove yourself from anything toxic socially and be in a place where you can feel safe and protected from this sort of thing happening."
176052015,my thought broadcasting sucks i say ?????? up ???? with my thoughts so i try to cover it with thinking nice things about people which works a little. i have my good days and bad days. im taking medication for ocd for intrusive thoughts but doesnt seem to work. i think the only thing thats working is my schizo meds. i thought about suicide but im trying to stay strong.for those who have tb please be strong dont give up
174355120,"I don’t care about sex anymore, no desire to be intimate. I know it’s from my meds, got severe negative symptoms. I’m also 50 years old so that may have something to do with it. Maybe I’m low on testosterone I don’t know."
176052016,Yes all the time or some thing my voices say is on TV or some thing my family says
174355115,I was diagnosed with schizoeffective at the age of 19 but experience hearing sounds which only lasted a few days to a week as early as 14 and mood problems. Didnt really start hearing voices until the age of 26 to 27 when i got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
176052017,Woke up with some Mania. Had a very productive day. Now some depression is setting in. Oh well it was good while it lasted.
176052018,"To be wise or not to be, that is the question"
176052019,Yes. Slowly taper off. I had a gran mal coming off of xanax and that was only like 2 mgs a day. It’s a silly thing which is probably in response to all that damage the painkillers have done to our societies. I’m not a fan of knocking big pharma but there’s some seriously dangerous policies that these drug companies do for profit. Benzo’s aren’t the best thing and are addictive but they can be useful especially in the short term. Tirate down for sure and let your doctor know you can’t just stop. That is unreasonable if you take a bit.

176052023,"APs and mood stabilizers basically kill your emotions. Not always true but in many cases. We’re emotional creatures. We need some ups and downs, to feel the thrill when listening to music or watching our favorite sports team. Mental illness treatments come at a price. A bit too expensive if you ask me."

176052026,"Yes, I’ve noticed that the’re everywhere at all times too. I’m glad I’m not the only one who’s noticed this. My voices also do other things that terrify me night and day. I wish you all the best too."
176052027,Whoa sorry you had to endure that _AT_MENTION_ . Know that it was just a vivid hallucination.
176052028,"As rough as life gets, there’s always liquor, bacon and porn."
176052029,yea like the others said you need to be on APs probably… it’s best to talk about it with your pdoc.
176052030,Yeah. It sounds like you need a dosage change or new med. can you call your pdoc?
176052031,ask them to bring you

176052040,"I didn’t know i am in trouble. The voices said “god help us” another voice said, “i am here, i help you”, i know gods help, not good, i never ask for help, i don’t want it. How dare the voices putting that s(h)it in my head. Sometimes i wish my language would be fish. Blub, blob,blib."

174355117,"Some people on here mentioned that people who don’t wear masks have low IQ, and knowing that I’m not particularly the smartest person, I decided to take a free IQ test online. Now, I realize that this isn’t an official IQ test, but I thought it might give me a baseline on what my possible official score could be. I got an 83, so that’s not too good. I really feel like schizophrenia and medication ruined my intelligence and motivation to do things. I guess I wasn’t too surprised because my grades suffered quite a bit after my onset; I used to be a A and B student, then I was a C, D, and F student. Hopefully I can get more intelligence, but that’s not looking too good."

176052044,No need to worry…worst case you are a little zombiefied. You can always reduce it later if it’s too much. Hopefully it won’t sedate you too much and it will kill your delusions. That would be great no? Try and trust your pdoc’s judgement.

176052058,I had a delusion once that the downstairs tenants in a house i was staying at were putting poisonous gas in the air vents. Think about it. When i think about it now i realize how far out an idea that is. For one thing the people would have to be handling poison which puts themselves at risk. Second all the air vents in the house are connected so they would be poisoning themselves third poison is hard to acquire fourth its against the law and they would get serious jail time fifth they had no motive to poison me sixth i was actually the one who was a danger to them because i was paranoid and off my meds

176052061,"I wish I could tell you how I fell asleep, eventually I’d be crawling on the floor away from the window, then exhaustion took over. It has to do with trauma of my mom being out all hours of the night using substances and me calling every bar at 2am.

174355121,"We both take a bit of naloxone then Good you’re on subuxone I think. It’s really helped a lot of people I know. Naltrexone I went on for alcoholism but it’s had some strange miracle reaction in me where not only does it stop me from drinking, doing drugs, but it helps my moods, anxieties and thinking in general. It’s lucky though. I think it’s because of the ingredient naloxone but I could be wrong. (Naloxone is also in suboxone and it’s what blocks opioids from working, it also is narcan) I never actually got into opioids. Well I was doing Vicodin and kratom a little and then I started the naltrexone and obviously since I’m not an addict to opioids I’m not gonna sacrifice the good effects of naltrexone to take opioids. I’m also schizoaffective. It sounds like you’re suffering mood issues possibly. Well regardless of your age, you may wanna ask your doc to add on an ssri like Zoloft if you’re feeling down. It could honestly help with addiction, mood lifts like ssri’s. Since 
you can’t take iboga on zyprexa or ayahuasca or anything like that. Since the pharmaceutical route is the only thing proven to help sz’s at this point… and really capable either. I would consider a mood booster. Such as a Zoloft or maybe a mood balancer in lithium. Whatever your doctor thinks. But I don’t think I was doing well as a sza before starting Zoloft. Because of the mood aspect. Although antidepressants can make us psychotic but if you’re stable enough on the antipsychotics then sometimes we can take antidepressants. But everyone is so unique. I hope I’m helping, not hurting. Thanks -_NAME_. Feel free to tag me _AT_MENTION_ anytime you wanna chat! But from your post I remember a quote on the wall at iop like ten years ago saying “mental health recovery is the same of addiction recovery” Or something like that. I botched the quote.

I’ve only experienced success for depression. I would ask about the pdocs experience, how many for x successes, etc. ECT has come a long way. I’m just glad that it was my best option."

These are also all symptoms of it. I forgot about them as they mostly disappeared also no one at the hospital cared about those symptoms. However years later I am on hair vitamins because I still have brittle hair, still have visuals, memory issues, weight fluctuation, still very easily startled by sound and still feel tired a lot of the time.

174355135,"ap’s are a blunt, broad device. My schizophrenia was caused by chronic abuse during childhood which caused dysfunctional brain development & gene expression during my developmental years & became permanent. I recently went to an academic lecture where the professor/researcher presented his research findings on adult survivors of child abuse who’d ended their life & he’d dissected their brains. At question time, someone questioned, can you treat these dysfunctional brains? He said, “only bluntly, generally. we can’t target the cause specifically. That has a long way and a lot of research to go.” Therefore, we only have ap’s. They are blunt. They cause weight gain, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes, all of which are unintended side effects. Plus, I don’t find them particularly helpful in treating the positive symptoms of my schizophrenia."

174355145,"I lost like 20 iq points it feels. never been tested. but i cannot do basic tasks, i lack initiation and motivation and energy. i have no drive/energy. stuff that was second nature is now harder than quantum physics like brushing teeth, showering, working, and doing laundry. i used to eat and cook and now i just barely do that. im still overweight. i got white matter lesions that could either be tumor, ms, vasculitis (caffeine/cigs?), or just some weird crap going on or even just schizophrenia in the long run. im sort of dehydrated too. i used to do calculus in my head as well as basic diff eqs and now it all has to be written down. I was much smarter back then although I experienced periods of giftedness where I could do stuff I couldn’t do or grasp before. Like in college I failed the final exam in probability and I aced it when I got home years later on risperdal. It was super easy. Stuff like that. I don’t know."
176052133,My opinion changes quickly…
176052134,"Hell, everybody and every body is different. But at age 59 I am kind of proud that I can still get aroused by a woman. Sex ain’t that important to me except to joke around about it but if women are going to “turn on” their sex appeal (it’s rare but it happens) I’ll go along with the program and co-operate, lol. _PERSON_, there’s a real nice 26-30 year old woman at work. She’s one of the soldiers and she’s really nice and sweet and I’ve talked to her several times and I swear, about the third time I talked to her the way she was acting I thought she was honest-to-god going to kiss me. But I am sure she was just acting and that’s the way she flirts and teases but it felt nice nonetheless."

176052146,"I think that’s a partial answer. It also means don’t be so quick to judge another human being because you don’t know their life or what hardships they have faced or what they’ve been through personally until you face them yourself. Hmmm, that’s almost rambling."

176052148,"It’s a rather stubborn flaw of mine to compare myself to other people, especially people who are, by all appearances, more put-together mentally. But I do still try to remind myself that we all have something going on, and perhaps other people unfavorably compare themselves to me, too (hey, as long as we’re talking hypotheticals :p). I’m wondering if an aptitude test might point me in the right direction. I know they’re not to be taken as law, but I’m looking for any guidance I can get at this point. Sounds like a good and stable job. Also sounds suited for your abilities. When did it start to get repetitive? Any chance of moving to a less repetitive position?"
176052149,Doctors don’t get money from meds.

176052156,"wouldnt know, i’ve never tried one. i’ve never been that overweight, about 10 pounds overweight at most. i count my calories, which works for me. don’t want to say they don’t work, if you have a little extra income to spend on supplements, then you can experiment with them and see if they work. personally, i would rather spend my money on good food, only taking wheat germ oil, for vitamin e to lower prolactin and vitamin d in the winter. i used to take fish oil and liked it, but stopped it."

174355154,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 9 years ago and I’m 39 years old female. I’ve been using solian for a year and it works well for me. I took solian 50mg and lorans 1mg per day. However my prolactin level surged to over 3,000 and my period cycle stop because of that. I tried switching to abilify 5mg for two weeks and got my periods back but my symptoms worsen. My doctor proposed to me to take abilify 10mg together with solian 50mg to help decrease my prolactin level. Anyone here who is using this combination and it actually works? Or anyone has ever heard of this combination? This is my first day to take solian with abilify so have to see how it goes. I don’t know if adding abilify would also improve my sex life as solian kind of inhibited it. Thanks everyone for reading this ; I know it’s a bit lengthy! Hope I can have some feedback."
176052159,"For what it’s worth, I’m on 50mg and it’s done right by me. No major side effects I’ve noticed."

176052175,Yeah fair cop. Just trying to give you some alternatives. Life often points you to paths that really aren’t or they really are good for you. I’m a bit of a Taoist when it comes to work. I’ve done some pretty different things to get work in the past and done well. I can always pull off an interview even when psychotic so I can dance the dance. All’s I’m saying is have a look what is out there. My fav job of all time was a bookstore. Brilliant work. Paid crap. Still. I did really well in it and I loved it. I know it’s really crappy times in most places to get jobs these days but have a look around for something you think you’d be good at. You’ve time to look. You’ve a good base while your looking.

176052184,"I agree. I don’t want to be cynical but there’s millions of as*holes out in the world who cause all kinds of trouble. There’s so many people doing drugs, selling drugs and doing criminal things as a way of life. And they just don’t care who they hurt or who’s lives they ruin, they are just out for themselves. Of course there’s lots of nice people too. But there’s so many people causing so much trouble. And then look at you. You’re just trying to solve your physical and mental challenges. You don’t sound like you want to harm anyone or cause any trouble. Why should you hate yourself? You’re just trying to survive the obstacles in your life that are no fault of your own. You don’t ask for much, you just want to be treated good and you probably just want to be liked. Hell, to be honest, personally when i first got diagnosed, if I used your reasoning I should have offed myself. But I would have been a 100% wrong. When I got sick at age 19 I wasn’t doing anything for anybody. I c
ouldn’t function and I needed lots of help. From age 19-22 I couldn’t support myself or do most normal things. I could barely take care of myself. My two main talents were I could take a shower and dress myself. Other than that I wasn’t doing anybody any good. i mean I should have been in the prime of life and doing a bunch of cool things. But instead I was in a hospital for 8 months. My parents are as loyal as yours and they wanted to help me and they visited me every day for 8 months. I could have just given up and let the disease win. I had nothing. No money, no job, no girlfriend, no school, no independence, no car, no friends. But my parents didn’t give up on me. You’re lucky, you know how many times I’ve read on this forum about parents who reject their children because they become schizophrenic? Lots of times. But your parents are trying to help you it sounds like. And they want you to get better. I mean when parents have kids, they are in it for the long haul. Parents raise they’re kids 
in this world knowning full well all the bad sh*t that could happen to anybody on earth. And their job is to protect their children. You just got unlucky just like the rest of us on this forum and got this disease. It doesn’t mean that your family should desert you. You’re family, and when something bad happens in life the natural thing is for the family to pull together and help the family member who is struggling. Yeah, I was kinda in your shoes from about 19-22 years old. I needed a lot of help. But I stuck around and eventually, I got better, in very small ways. I co-operated with doctors and took my medication and did the best i could. And eventually, with lots of help I became more independent and accomplished stuff in life. LOts of people feel useless sometimes in their life. But some of my proudest accomplishments is eventually being able to “give back” and help my family. I helped move everyone in my family more than a dozen times. They like to travel and I housesat and took care of their pet
s and watered their plants a million times. I did yardwork for my whole family. When something needed to be picked up at the grocery store I got whatever they needed. I drove my sisters and my dad to the airport so many times i lost track. I mean I know you have physical limitations but maybe in the future you will be able to help in some ways. Everybody needs help some time in their life. You just got to accept that right now you need that help. Your future might get better. When I was young my future looked like c rap. It looked hopeless. But I pulled out of it and now I’ve worked for many years and went to school and did other things. And I learned not to be a burden. I’m not saying you are a burden, I’m just speaking for myself. IDK. I could go on. I never could have predicted that I would get better. But I did. Hell, I spent the entire 80’s in hospitals, group homes and mental health housing. That was just the way it was. I started the 90""s off pretty strong and now I’m just kind of cruising. 
I have my janitor job, I have my apartment. Things get pretty good sometimes. You just got to have faith that things will get better. You have to keep trying and have faith things will get at least a little better. You’ve got your translating job, right? That’s a huge step, give yourself credit. _PERSON_ what else to say. Things get bleak sometimes, but often times get tolerable. You deserve to be on this planet as much as anyone else. And more than most. Things change, in both good and bad ways. I wish you luck and hope you get something out of this."

I feel like I’m making good progress. I’m down to 340.6 lbs, but I keep accidentally telling people 240 but have to correct myself. Oh well, I’m thinking thin.

176052244,"Update 2: After a walk with my dog in the dawn’s light I can see I woke up to a severe panic attack. I was not expecting melatonin to have such a drastic effect. The flashbacks of intoxication brought me back to the last time I got high which is when I experienced FEP about 40 days ago. You can imagine the triggering from there. I’m a anxious person by nature and the trauma is still so fresh, especially after the Seraquel. In the past few days of detox I thought the effects of Seraquel were worse than the symptoms it was treating. My delicate brain is still finding its way home from chronic substance abuse and now horrible AP effects, and a month of prescribed daily benzo use. I need to remember that… I feel good right now and I will cherish every moment. Thanks for reading."

I would be content to lay in bed for 20 hours, and sleep 15 - 20 hours a day for a week. I feel so much better on Geodon and Seroquel. You might ask your pdoc about those drugs."

176052299,The DSM 5 upgraded sza. In the DSM4 someone with a first episode of psychosis could be diagnosed sza where sz was 6 months of symptoms as a minimum. That’s probably why it had a better prognosis although the criteria for diagnosis is now more stringent so that may change. But that also leaves a lot of people who have previously been diagnosed sza not meeting the criteria anymore.

The docs says that it all comes from my paranoia… I should be patient with my treatment, even if 4 years been gone on them? Yeah, right now, i push myself more but i have this body stuff…"

176052367,I think I am having an inreasing cognitive decline in my condition. I having a harder time processing things such as tasks from work. Like I am not picking up what people are saying. Example muy boss asked me over three times to do something and I just couldn’t get it. I just wasn’t processing it. So my question is what are your symptoms. Maybe then I can see if I am experiencing more. I just feel like i am in a decline of shorts and just want to reach out.

I woke up to the sweet fluff sleeping beside me, and he gave me kisses. That made me to assure myself that everything will be alright. I’m hoping that I will not have another PTSD episode tonight because I tend to have a string of these episodes. I was shaking uncontrollably last night and everything was just telling me to self-harm. Not voices, but like the feelings were just pointing to self-harm. It was horrifying. I didn’t harm myself. My head is hurting massively…it just reminds me of one of my psychotic episodes which I ended up the hospital, and was restrained due to how severe it was."

176052489,Yeah. But you’re not a bad person. Don’t feel bad. You reported it to your dr so that means you care for others and you did the right thing
176052490,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ . You aren’t a terrible mother. Those of us with kids have messed up, too. But we love our kids and let them know that, and it makes up for it. You don’t have to feel guilty; you are just the victim of a disease. It’s something you can’t help anymore than you can help cancer or migraines or any other issue. You just have to take your meds as directed and trudge through. I’ve read your posts on this board, and you seem to be a very sweet person who gives good advice and cares about others. Your son is bound to see that in you, and that is what he’ll learn- not that he missed a field trip. I, too, have done things like this. My son had a project in 4th grade that required him to find different kinds of seeds and glue the to this piece of paper. His teacher contacted me because she said she couldn’t display his work because he only had one seed, which he had found on his own. He had mentioned the project to me, and I didn’t do anything to help him. I still feel awful a
bout that. Yesterday, I started crying because I had thrown out poinsettias in 2017 after their leaves fell off. My husband kept a third one (with no leaves) and nursed it back to health. It is thriving, and we’ve even had to change its pot because it got so big. But I threw away those other plants, and I started thinking that maybe they could have thrived, too. I let a living thing die. I also frequently think about all of the awful things I did when I was younger as well as the awful things I do now. I can’t fix all the mistakes I’ve made, even though I’d like to. I sometimes think that guilt is inherent in people with sz/sza because we all know we are different, and we all struggle. From your posts, it sounds like you are feeling awful about a lot of things. Would you happen to have sza? I’m asking because I start to feel guilty during depressive episodes. I want to make sure you are okay. Please don’t think of yourself as a bad mom. Kids remember the cool things better than the bad."

176052496,It’s a hallucination. It’s a positive symptom that is reported where it should not in general population. As sz and drug use causes it you’d think one is related to the other. It’s meaning or content isn’t relavent. Perhaps why you aren’t understanding the problem and wasting energy on trying to find meaning in the process.

176052499,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts.

176052502,"Hi guys! So I’ve been prescribed Trihexyphenidyl, which is a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease. I don’t have Parkinson’s, but I have significant spasticity that isn’t treated well. Serious side effects include psychosis and delirium, as that’s how it is with Parkinson’s meds. My doctor told me to call the hospital if I experience any symptoms of psychosis. I know this med can reduce my spasticity, but I feel like I’m gambling with my sanity."
176052503,"I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_. Is there a support group for family members you could join? It might help to talk to people who can relate and empathize better than the forum can. My dad and one of my sisters are sociopaths. I always knew my dad and sister were completely unable to connect emotionally with others, they can’t empathize, they get excited over other people’s suffering. It’s really hard to live with people like that. Do you still live with your daughter? Distance can be really helpful. So can emotional distance. Try to separate from her emotionally as much as you’re able. By that, I mean I know you’ll always love her, but you need a protector wall up with her unfortunately. Always be prepared for her to cause you pain. It helps to not be shocked by it. It also helps to have physical distance. My dad has learned how to act so that he appears to care. But I know he can’t and it’s an act. Your daughter may evolve over time and learn to behave like she cares, even when she doesn’

174355233,If you are still hallucinating you haven’t found the right meds yet and you need to keep working with your doctor. You are more than likely schizophrenic with those symptoms. I have a hard time with delusions too. Unfortunately meds don’t really help with what we believe or perceive. They can stop hallucinations though. Mine work pretty well. I hallucinate crazy complicated stuff when off meds. Visual and audio too.

I did what I had to, but didn’t think about it. I was dehumanized and demoralized. I was there under the auspices of a lie, surrounded by idiots, and doing meaningless things to pass the time. Others around me were like ghosts passing in a fog. They were there, but their eyes were hollow. There was always a general sense of terror that hung over me, but very quickly that terror turned to apathy, and finally, nothing. Who here knows what I’m talking about?"

Were i live, the psych doctors go home at 4 or 5 pm and the nurses do evening and nightshifts (there is a pdoc on call at home for emergency). And the nurses are often more kind and humble, which makes me respect them more. I disliked i was to call the nurse “_NAME_” or “_NAME_” and the pdoc “Doctor so-and-so”. They also did that among each other. This inequality felt very disrespectful to the nurses in my eyes. I dont mind calling someone doctor _PERSON_, but then he can call me Drs _PERSON_ or _PERSON_ - and i will call the nurses who work their ass off mr/mrs _PERSON_ too. ."

176052634,"I won’t go into a ton of detail but something happened while I was out and about. I came across someone with children who alluded to the idea that they were afraid of their SO. To be clear, this person never explicitly said they were afraid. Not for themselves and not for their children. That was solely my impression. And they never said any physical abuse was happening. I looked for evidence of physical abuse on her and the children but could not see any. Despite this, I’m still worried. I’ve already confirmed with others that they at least saw me talking to this person, so I know the person was not a hallucination. But I have no idea if the conversation I think I had actually happened and I have no way to check. Now I desperately need help processing the whole situation. But I worry about the repercussions of talking with pdoc about it. So lets assume that everything really happened. If pdoc alerts authorities and they get involved, I have reason to believe the system where I am from could 
potentially do way more harm than good. Harm to everyone involved, including me and the children. But if we assume that I am misremembering the conversation as I sometimes do, I worry that I may get into legal trouble if she is required to report. So I want to know if I tell pdoc about this, is she mandated to report this to police or our version of CPS even though she didn’t personally witness any of it?"

Good thing my injection has made me extremely stable compared to where I was a yr-2yrs ago. I think I’m on a good combo. Two Fridays ago, l-theanine (first dose ) made me suicidal.

176052696,"Try a medication for a period of about one month to three months, vary the amount if you and your psychiatrist think that will help. Keep the goal, being that the lowest amount optimal for resolving your symptoms. Try to live with someone else who knows you well, and have them help gauge if you’re improving or if you’re being irritable. They might notice if you’re stiff even when you don’t. These sorts of things are really helpful diagnostics. It took about two years for me to get to a point where I think I’m well treated. I still might have to change a medication due to other side effects but I’m not sure yet if thats the case or if its because I need a dietary change. Please look into support options and housing support if you are at risk."
176052697,"Ok, something that helps me (that I need to remind myself right now too!) is that one of my counselors told me that “thoughts are not facts.” I took an anxiety workshop where they broke down the anatomy of anxiety and OCD. You can’t change your anxious thoughts and it’s very difficult and exhausting to try and control them. BUT the thing you can control is your reaction to said thoughts. I find it helps to try and be an ‘impartial observer’ of your thoughts. For me it’s intrusive, disturbing or offensive thoughts. For you if it’s paranoia of bad things that could happen, I suppose you would observe these thoughts for what they are, just anxious thoughts. You label the thought “anxious” and try to let your mind move on to other things. I sometimes get a barrage of awful thoughts and I really try to tell myself “wow that was awful. moving right along now!” (easier said than done with thought broadcast) There’s also a CBT technique where you sit in a chair and say to yourself 
“this chair will break and I will fall and hurt myself.” And when it doesn’t happen, you take away the negative power that your paranoid thoughts have over you. Hope some of this helps?"

176052728,"I remember seeing a documentary about a 24-year old Belgium woman with severe treatment resistant depression who requested euthanasia and who ultimately did die by euthanasia. It was a very troubling documentary because this young woman was physically healthy, had a mother who loved her, and had friends who cared very much for her. Her mother and friends did not want her to go through with the euthanasia but there was ultimately nothing they could do to change her mind. While I support euthanasia as a choice that should be made available to the terminally ill, I do not support it as a choice for non terminally ill people nor for the mentally ill. I myself have treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and so, to an extent, I can sympathize with the young woman in the documentary. However, after living with these chronic conditions for thirty years, I have found that my life has been a worthwhile life."

A day later, my friend came up to me and thanked me for coming. She also told me that I valued him and his life by expressing my sorrow. I mean, a young life perished.

176052752,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I’m not sure yet my review isn’t until later
176052753,"Just curious. I took sarcosine for a little while and loved it. It helped with my anhedonia and I felt so much more energized and less depressed. I had to stop taking it because three times in a row in the span of the two months I took it, I had a visual hallucination of a giant spider crawling across my ceiling. The exact same hallucination, three times in a row. It took me until the third time to realize I was hallucinating and it wasn’t just a weird trick of the light. I’d never had visual hallucinations like that before, so I was concerned and told my mom and she told me to stop taking it, though I really didn’t want to. I suppose it was probably for the best though. Since I stopped, I’ve been trying to find a supplement that can do what sarcosine did for me negative symptom wise. Do any of you have any recommendations? and has sarcosine caused hallucinations in any of you? I find it so bizarre. I’ve never heard of it happening."

176052760,"I don’t get your point _AT_MENTION_ You want us to say that you don’t have schizophrenia and that all your impossible delusions are real? A test isn’t really accurate.

176052767,Thank you my friends… Yeah. But the vape is the lesser of two evils… once I’ve got a month a way from cigarettes or so I’ll likely get more ambitious about cutting back. It’s day 7 now though and I do feel a certain freedom from my past dependence. Vaping just feels more casual and even throughout the experience. Take care y’all.
176052768,I cannot cope anymore. I cannot work properly and my family no longer have a say for my destiny at work. I lose my job I lose my independence. I will lose everything and I cannot do this anymore. The stress is too much and I am so angry. I don’t know where to turn. My parents just forced me to take my meds. The doctors lie and cheat. Make you take these ??????? tablets for no good reason. We will all die eventually and there is no need to string things out even further. This will all end and you need to be the master of your own destiny. Give in and give up and suffer the inevitable. Cause pain.

176052782,"Interesting thread. My delusion was that one of my close friends was simply pretending and was really a psychopathic manipulator. I wasn’t able to rid myself of this delusion for absolute years. Some of our mutual friends argued with me about it. Others kind of indulged my belief. It was only when I got into a heated argument with the close friend about a completely different conflict a few years later - fell out with them publicly - and got to voice a lot of my anger that I was able to see it didn’t make sense. Ultimately I think I felt rejected by them. We were friends, close friends at times, but I never quite felt they were open with me and I think I was unsure whether I mattered to them. Sometimes it feels like your pouring a lot into something and not getting a return of your efforts. I suppose I felt like that. Luckily a couple years later was luckily able to patch things up and they were very empathetic and kind about it. And tbh while I still have the occasional paranoid thought about 
them overall I feel closer to them now than I did when we were originally friends."

The objective truth most likely is that I didn’t power through due to strength, I just got lucky, and that’s why I got a lot better. You have a lot of room to recover, you are very young.

My mind has more than one actor and occasionally more than one mode (I can’t call it a mood really). The most confusing thing is that when it happens it is partially beyond my control. But it doesn’t control me to the point that I am not at least partially responsible for my actions. And obviously if I did something really horrible I’d deserve to be punished like everyone else.

Because it was intuitively helpful in some sort of way for my self esteem Such as society kind of guides you with the directional hand. The group conscious everybody is more or less a part of also guides the individual. And for me since my ego was so damaged and cracked that it made sense to let me believe I was something special. Because we are all special. Maybe I exaggerated it but it hasn’t been the worst thing in the world. At times perilous, other times I can see some benefits of this delusion.

174355345,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Are Randomized Controlled Trials on Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy for Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia Comparable? A Systematic Review of Patient and Study Characteristics. I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Schizophrenia bulletin, Apr 2020 10 We examined patient and study characteristics of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy trials to establish whether the effects of these 2 treatment strategies can be compared meaningfully.We inspected all randomized controlled trials included in 2 recent _NAME_-analyses on antipsychotics and psychotherapy in patients with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, searching EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Differences between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy trials were analyzed with Wilcoxon-Mann-_NAME_ and chi-square tests.Eighty studies with 18 271 participants on antipsychotic drugs and 53 studies with 4068 participants on psychotherapy were included. Psychoth
erapy studies included less severely ill patients (P < .0001), with a shorter duration of illness (P = .021), lasted for a longer period (P < .0001), administered the intervention as add-on to antipsychotics (P < .0001), had higher risk of bias in some domains including blinding of outcome assessment (P < .0001), and were funded publicly more frequently (P < .0001). Antipsychotic trials had larger sample sizes (P < .0001) and more study centers (P < .0001), included more males (P = .0001), inpatients (P < .0001), and slightly older patients (P = .031), more often used diagnostic operationalized criteria (P = .006), and were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. They did not differ in conflict of interest (P = .24).We found key differences between the 2 groups of studies that encompass higher risk of bias in psychotherapy studies and the inclusion of more severe patients in drug trials. These differences imply that study and patient characteristics should be carefully taken into account before considering a n
etwork _NAME_-analysis. In the interest of patients, psychopharmacologists and psychotherapists should optimize their treatments rather than seeing them in competition."

But I realize I see people on the street and think “I want to be accepted by them.” I don’t want to live like an outsider who feels they only belong with other people with sz anymore (I’ve felt that way for a long time now). Action wise my objectives are the same. I’d like to keep working and function good in daily life (like go to the gym and shower and do laundry), keep up my mental and physical health, have good relationships with friends and at support group, and overall get my ???? together, if you will. Some of my longer term values are for family, friends, and Hawai’i. I want to be a mom one day and be accepted by my relatives and be able to live independently (with my husband and kids). I also want my friend _NAME_ to find a job and fini
sh school and not grow far apart from me one day. I also really like Hawai’i. I want to be an active member of the community here and go to all the restaurants and enjoy the good weather. I have no desire to move. I have another “mini” value and that’s to see my family in China ever year or two and eat wonton soup.

One is something that you take that is medicinal, the other is something that you do. If this is not the proper Forum, please let me know. I practice meditation daily, and find it helps to keep me calmer and more centered throughout the day. There is absolutely no religious or spiritual connotation to this form of meditation, it is simply a grounding exercise. Get in a comfortable position, whether this is sitting in a chair or lying down. Once you are comfortable, simply notice how your right hand feels. Focus gently on your hand until you feel it tingling. You don’t have to try to do anything, simply notice how your right hand feels. To keep you focussed in the moment, you can try shifting your awareness from one finger to the next until each tingles in turn. If you find this too challenging, focussing simply on your hand is just fine. Take a few deep breaths, and allow 
your attention to settle into your hand in a deeper and deeper sense. This is simply helping you to ground and Center yourself, nothing more. Your mind will wander off, you’ll start thinking about yesterday, or what’s for dinner. This is quite natural. Each time you find yourself doing that, just simply bring your attention back to your right hand until you feel it tingling again. It’s very simple, and very easy to do If you do this a couple of times a day, even five or 10 minutes at a time, you should begin to find a difference within six weeks. It is quite easy and even comforting to do the exercise, and the results are accumulative. Just think of it as taking your vitamins. Physical Sensations are the most direct way to stay in touch with what is real. The sensation is immediate, and calming If you’re curious enough to try it, let me know what you find. Cheers"

176052973,Reminds me of that twilight zone episode with the guy on a plane. He goes crazy about a monster on the wing of the plane. It reminds me of myself and of the story you told.
176052974,"Last night I noticed that sum of larger numbers in doubles 21 7 and 12 4 is 33 and sum of smaller numbers is 11. So we have 33 and 11. Sum of 33 and 11 is 44, it is the same sum as sum of 13 and 31. From the digits of 33 and 11 numbers 13 and 31 can be formed at the same time! Numbers 13 and 31 were especially associated with dates of beginning and ending of my third full going to a day hospital (27.4 and 24.7 in 2017) and three triplets: 7, 29, 139; 7, 11, 13 ; 7, 2, 4 (especially second one), also with five-digit three-membered ascending arithmetic sequences formed by digits of the sequence 6, 13, 20 (associated with days in the month when three men from my locality, including my grandfather, died). I noticed that if we sort digits forming one of four “miraculous” arithmetic sequence (for example 11, 24, 37) ascendingly and then form three two-digit numbers, we will receive 11, 23, 47 . It is a sequence which is not geometric or arithmetic, although it has interesting properties. It is built 
by three consecutive Thabit numbers which are additive prime numbers, and, more interestingly, sums of digits in 11, 23, 47 are also three consecutive 321 numbers which are additive primes (2, 5, 11). Difference between middle and smaller term of that sequence is 12 (23-11), between the largest and the middle - 24 (47-23), between the largest and the smallest - 36 (47-11). These differences form arithmetic sequence 12, 24, 36 , in which sums of digits in numbers forming it are: 3, 6, 9 (“Tesla’s arithmetic sequence”); similar subtracting in the case of sequence 21, 42, 84 also produces arithmetic sequence in which sums of digits in numbers form arithmetic sequence 3, 6, 9 ((42-21 = 21), (84-42 = 42), (84-21 = 63); we have received 21, 42, 63 ). What is in my opinion most amazing, numbers: 11, 23, 47 are three first members of series of seven additive primes which have additive primes (in addition being 321 numbers) as their sums of digits. The sequence is: 11, 23, 47, 83, 131, 191, 263 . Sums of digits 
of numbers: 11 --> 1+1 = 2 , 23 --> 2+3 = 5 , 47 --> 4+7 = 11 , 1+1 = 2 , 83 --> 8+3 = 11 , 1+1 = 2 , 131 --> 1+3+1 = 5 , 191 --> 1+9+1 = 11 , 1+1 = 2 , 263 --> 2+6+3 = 11 , 1+1 = 2 . Sums of digits in these numbers are Thabit primes (additive in addition), which have additive primes being 321 numbers as their sums of digits. 11, 23, 47, 83, 131, 191, 263 - “ultimately” additive prime numbers."

Don’t want a medal or any recognition for it, as that would be a fruitless dream All I expect is respectful treatment by the health system, which is kinda lacking at the moment with the threatening behaviour and even bullying I experienced last Friday from a doctor."
176052976,"You’re right-- just coast on the positive . I appreciate you putting things into a bit more perspective. Thanks so much for your reply, _AT_MENTION_"
176052977,I’m sorry you want to leave
176052978,You should keep busy with a hobby or work or something instead of researching such things.
176052979,I’m super proud! Congratulations on a nearly 20% increase and a sweet new title.
176052980,I got thrown into a cell due to beeing to drunk on a public party. But that didnt make it into my record.

176052981,Great. Very talented.
176052982,Is it called boneset because it helped deal with the pain from old school bone setting post break?
176052983,You’re in Louisiana right? Do y’all have stuff like that like painted skulls? I heard that there’s a lot of voodoo in New _USER_ID_ and other religious stuff religious Oopsy I can’t say anything else. I heard like on Mardi Gras people dress up as skeletons and have a parade with a casket. Like a fake funeral
176052984,"If you want something that binds tightly to D2 and is generic, check out pimozide (brand name Orap). Binds even tighter than Haldol. Only other med that’s close to Haldol’s D2 affinity is Prolixin (fluphenazine). Vraylar…ergh. Have not tried it myself. My pdoc won’t use it any longer. He tried it on a few patients, and they all went manic or hypomanic. Small sample size, but large enough for him to say no to it. Trilafon should be ok. I think there’s a different manufacturer that’s not in play (Upsher-_NAME_?..I forgot). Moban (molindone) is making a comeback, and is generally weight neutral. Maybe an option. It’s in the FDA Orange Book, and last I heard, production is ramping up. Some small, no-name pharma company. Finally, loxapine (Loxitane) has not been caught up in the many meds affected at all. Produced by Lancett. Sometimes it’s sedating though. In the same potency class as Trilafon."
174355360,"I suppose If I can hold down a fulfime job that at times requires fulfime concentration and my faculties are the same as before I got schizophrenia then id say I am not disabled enough to drive, just chose for safety not to as I live in the city and can use public transportation."
174355356,I don’t believe they are primarily caused by the meds at all. I say this because I’m still exhausted despite hardly ever taking my medication regularly. It’s definitely not the medication that gives me negative symptoms - and negative symptoms is the bulk of my problem ever since diagnosis.
176052985,"I don’t see anything wrong with it but keep in mind the amounts of the amino acids and herbs are miniscule. For the herbs, it’s 8mg of that mix of herbs so like a grain of sand’s worth of each. A microdose. I don’t know what the typical dosage of these herbs is to get an effect, but for instance the average dose of ginkgo seems to be between 40-240mg, so a fraction of 8mg is not going to do anything, probably. (PS I am not reccomending ginkgo, or not, just using it as an example of amounts.) And the amino acids are what happens to occur naturally in gelatin. 10 mg is almost nothing - to give you an idea, in one scoop of whey protein (just plain whey with no additives) there is 1,100 mg of alanine, 700 mg of arginine, 535 mg of cystine, 430 mg of glycine, 2,300 mg of lysine, 2,500 mg of methionine, 2,000 mg of proline, 1,400 mg of serine, 400mg of tryptophan and 1,300 mg of valine, plus others. So a 10mg mix of amino acids is like if you put your wet fingertip in whey and then licked it. So 
if you are paying extra for herbs and amino acids, don’t, they’re basically there in name only."
176052986,"I’ve not tried the supplements as they were not recommended by the new pdoc. My old pdoc had me trying CBD oil, but I tried the 3mg as that’s what I could barely afford, and she laughed and said “for your crazy you need at least 1500mg” I was insulted by her and she knew I couldn’t afford that. She was a real ?????, had no reason for her comments ever, she belittled me every chance she got. As for RSD it’s Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, or Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome type 1 as it’s been updated I found out from my husband doing some late night research at work. A lot of people end up with pain pumps, but they don’t like to do that until you’re in your 40’s or 50’s, and I’m 34. I was diagnosed with it in 1996, when I was 11. I was diagnosed SZ at age 10 after I went under general anesthesia for double Achilles tendon surgery, woke up and there were violent voices and delusions, they said normal reaction, but it never went away and only got worse. But my mom wasn’t officia
lly given my diagnosis of sz, they said it was just mental issues after I tried to kill myself so many times. Never ended up in a psych ward until I had post partum psychosis after _PERSON_ in 2005, he was 6 months old, _PERSON_ was 23 months old, I called my husband at work and said I need you home, I think I’m gonna kill myself and that psych ward made me 1000x worse, it’s a mess explaining st _NAME_’s south shore in milwaukee, but we got them in major trouble for ???? they did to me. I go for my hip MRI tomorrow, they told me take 2mg of xanax before checking in, so hoping I sleep thru it. Not really claustrophobic, but pain makes me unable to stay still, so it’s sleep or they IV knock me out, and I don’t trust Mercy to do an IV after causing this with an injection in my hip. I hope I get okayed for this drug trial soon, things have been very rough, and now _PERSON_ is starting to show symptoms of psychosis, he has voices, but he said he’s dealing and we got him back into his therapist, she mak
es him take the entire day off of school after their appts, school isn’t happy but he does have an IEP and medical thing on file. So i dare them to try and ???? with us like th er y did last year. I may be on a cane, but doesn’t mean i won’t get into it with a righteous ????? at the school that already doesn’t like my kid because he stood up against her for saying his now ex-girlfriend’s panic disorder was a cry for sympathy."
176052987,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ but the more I think about it the more I think it’s a bad idea to come off meds. Besides I’m sure my doctor will oppose to it.
176052988,I love Zoom AA meetings so much that no one is ever getting me into a real world one ever again. I imagine I’d feel the same way about Zoom classes. I do online Webinars for my job and can’t imagine enjoying F2F sessions more than the online ones.
176052989,"I appreciate that _AT_MENTION_ I was dealing with the pain good for years till the nurse messed up my hip in the ER in August and made the RSD in my leg jump from knee to hip. It’s a nerve condition where the nerves just thing they’re always in pain, I swell, get cold to the touch, turn purplish skin at the worst of it. I’m on a cane now so I can walk, I can drive but I only do the bare amount cause I have trouble judging pressure on the brake, I don’t speed or tailgate, and I don’t leave town. And we all know there isn’t much to do for arthritis, which is also my entire pelvis and lower back and both hips. Got that early on, didn’t actually start bothering me bad until my pregnancies. Then it was like damn, being 18 with arthritis sucks ass, lol."
176052990,I lost 16 lbs but I’m still in between the same two sizes I was at when I had lost about 5 lbs… I guess I figured I would be a little smaller than I turned out when I lost this much… But I’m still aiming for my goal and I won’t stop till I reach it!

So, they put me on Valproate, a mood - stabilizer . . I was discharged freely and, things were looking good, my new drug didn’t give me any side - effects I could feel or, notice . .

176053001,"Even just writing down on paper everything you eat in a day ignoring calories is a good start. Just counting the number of individual items one eats in a day isn’t too bad of a measurement either though not as accurate as calories. For calories I find it easier to just round to the nearest 50 or 100 calories. It’s good to know some calories of things that you eat everyday like a banana is 100 calories, a slice of bread is 100 calories etc… Weight watchers uses one digit points (like 2 points for a banana) but it’s pretty similar to just rounding off calories. If I go to a restaurant I try to guess as best as I can but I know it won’t be perfect. I break the meal down into parts. I do much better on estimating foods I eat at home. It’s pretty rough, but I have found out that for me if I eat over 1700 calories a day I generally tend to gain weight and under 1700 I tend to lose weight."

The game is much more complex than regular Chess(at which I am very talented), and I want to study it primarily for brain development. However, I see that there is a problem finding books about Shogi in English, but in Japanese it is easier to find appropriate books. So I came up with a solution: I shall study Japanese and that will allow me to access books about Shogi. So far so good."

174355373,"It’s funny, back in 2017 after I started getting treatment again I was on invega injections, and I was able to work full time despite being extremely delusional. Long story short, I quit that job because I thought I was being advised to go to college by a ghost and I guess I agreed. I started to question some of the things I was believing and then switched to abilify, and while I was waiting for college to start I got a temporary part-time job and had no problems doing it, despite still being very delusional. I then tried clozapine, but I got heart inflammation and had to stop taking it. Then I tried risperidone, which seemed to work very well on my positive symptoms, but looking back on it I see this medicine really made me non-functional - I couldn’t do college or either of the jobs I tried while on it, whether on a low or high dose or whether taking an antidepressant alongside it. I’m in the process of of switching to latuda. So far it seems to be working just as well on my positive sympto
ms, and I feel less bogged down and clearer in my thinking, which is promising. I know I don’t want to try working again until the risperidone is completely out of my system, but I still don’t know if I’ll feel ready to try by the time I get there. One thing I may want to do is try going on higher dose of effexor, which I couldn’t do on risperidone because I was getting some delusional thoughts once I went above 75mg. I also tend to think I may just be feeling messed up without my delusions to comfort me, and so keeping up any kind of work effort would be extra hard for me. We’ll see what happens."

176053017,"So hi all! How are you, people? I think of you my friends, but am participating fewer… Just trying to think less of the sz, it was an obsession for me for years… Well, I suffer a lot still from my fears. My doc even said, that I am probably passive not because of the negatives, but because of the fears… And the meds don’t help anymore, nope… I tried them all so I want try new ones, no… Only the benzos work a few, but I don’t want to depend on them. I take my Zyprexa still and the Depakote, but maybe I should boost my confidence now more and give myself more courage? Were your fears very bad too? Did they get better? How exactly? With attempts and attempts maybe? This can give me a bit more hope… My fears manifest also physically, so I am quite disabled. I wonder if the fears are a big part of the sz in general? Well, it will be good to know that there’s hope if I just start to try to beat them. Maybe sometimes tricks of meditation too, breathing, trying to think more rationally, t

174355372,"_USER_ID_, no offence but I think you lost the will to fight on. You say you have negative and cognitive symptoms but you are actively posting on here. Is this someone who truly has no motivation to do anything? I don’t think so. You clearly think about your illness a lot but you do nothing about it. You claim you have cognitive symptoms. I see you posting about medicine and research reports that I cannot understand. Clearly your cognitive abilities in some respects are above mine. I saw your post on learned helplessness. What you experience now is “learned helplessness”. You feel hopeless and there is destined to be no hope for someone with schizophrenia. Look to what you do here and tell me whether you truly have negative or cognitive symptoms. If you have trouble with negative symptoms, force yourself to exercise. Force yourself to bath. I told a veteran with schizoaffective disorder this. Force yourself to actually do something and eventually the motivation will come."
174355371,"There are many people who share their struggles with depression, anxiety, mental health, and schizophrenia in blogs, youtube, vlogs and other things like that. Do you think it is a good thing to share? Or do you think it is not? Do you think it could potentially affect you someday? What if your employer found out? Or what if your co-workers or even friends found out? This is a big fear of mine. I started a small YouTube channel a few years ago and it seemed to resonate with many people looking for answers and insight into schizophrenia. I eventually deleted it when some real life friends found my channel. I’ve since decided to start the channel again, not because I feel my story is particularly compelling, but simply because if I can help even 1 person or their family, it is worth it. But is it worth it? I want to travel more, I want to have a good career and job.

176053056,"Decline in working memory was my first issue I noticed long back around 20 years back. Over the years my working memory start declining. At first I thought it was ADHD as I already had that. But in ADHD we remain restless doing one activity to another with no gap in between. I was like that till around age 10. Then my activities start to reduce. I used to play lot of games like old cartridge games, play station CD games etc. Bought lot of them had a huge collection of it. Then when my working memory got affected more severely I lost interest in them as I quickly loss interest as things not holding in mind steadily. If some distraction come I quickly forget what I am doing before. Now my working memory almost not exist instead how I am coping is I memorize current picture, what doing now etc then when some interruption come I recollect previous memorized picture or thought then continue. This leaves a kind of pause in between steps. Anyway this is the way devised by my brain to cope with severe work
ing memory problem. Alarms, daily schedules etc help to remind about the things to do. Previously these things always exist in mind now need to use external things like alarms, schedules to prevent mind wandering issues. I think working memory issue is due to catatonia. Catatonia can come both in full blown and partial. Mine is partial. This minute catatonic spell blanks the mind then we need to recollect previous thought and continue."

Let me lay this out for you: Bipolar means sometimes you’re happy and full of energy, sometimes you’re sad. That’s it. Schizophrenia means you think the walls are crawling with bugs, your family members are shapeshifting aliens, there’s a camera under your skin, and the CIA is invading your skull with illegal telepathic technology. It also means you think you’re god and your food is being poisoned and you possibly hear voices in your head commanding you to kill people. Comparing bipolar to schizophrenia is like comparing a cold to leukemia."

176053089,"Hindustan Times – 20 Nov 17 Want to keep anxiety away? Keep your brain busy with memory games and math... Researchers in the US found that people at risk of anxiety were less likely to develop the disorder if they had higher activity in a brain region responsible for complex mental operations. Researchers have found that boosting activity in the brain’s areas related to thinking and problem-solving may also buffer against worsening anxiety. Using non-invasive brain imaging, the researchers found that people at risk of anxiety were less likely to develop the disorder if they had higher activity in a brain region responsible for complex mental operations. “These findings help reinforce a strategy whereby individuals may be able to improve their emotional functioning – their mood, anxiety, experience of depression – not only by directly addressing those phenomena, but also by indirectly improving their general cognitive functioning,” said _NAME_, professor at the _NAME_ University in North 
_USER_ID_, US. Participants also viewed angry or scared faces to activate a region of the brain called the _USER_ID_ and played a reward-based guessing game to stimulate activity in the brain’s ventral striatum. For the study, published in the journal Cerebral Cortex, researchers investigated undergraduate students whether higher activity in a brain region called dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could help shield these at-risk individuals from future mental illness. Each participant completed a series of mental health questionnaires and underwent a type of non-invasive brain scan called functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while engaged in tasks meant to activate specific regions of the brain. The researchers asked each participant to answer simple memory-based maths problems to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Participants also viewed angry or scared faces to activate a region of the brain called the _USER_ID_ and played a reward-based guessing game to stimulate activity in the brain’s 
ventral striatum. By comparing participants’ mental health assessments at the time of the brain scans, and in a follow-up on an average seven months later, the researcher found that these at-risk individuals were less likely to develop anxiety if they also had high activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."

It was during a hurricane, my 76-year-old aunt was driving me, and I used the back of my AA book and my kid’s library card to make it work. It was not my highest point. But, that was my last abusive dose. Back then I was using up to 600 mg/day and now I only take my prescribed 60 mg/day and don’t see how I could ever get off that.

That is cool and you’ve a lot to offer. Just don’t make it sound like your prescribing medications because that is a doctors job and not yours. Meanwhile we’ve already moved off the original posters concerns. Dm me if you need clarification.

It wasn’t true… Sz will make you doubt yourself on a fundamental level. It will make you question all your morals. All your concerns but it doesn’t make you… You know your not that person they say you are. You know your not responsible for all of those things that are outside your concern. You need to be strong enough to defend your opinion and not feel guilty. Your not responsible so you can’t be guilty. Be strong. Get stable and prove them wrong."

176053187,"The world has always been a weird place. Strange stuff abounds throughout history. If you want to talk about diseases that wiped out great numbers of people, how about the Black Plague in Europe where nearly half the population died? Diseases like smallpox killed millions of people. The measles decimated the population of Indians in America when _NAME_ and other foreigners brought it with them. There has been literally constant war all throughout history. Religion is directly responsible for so many wars and related deaths. There has been mass genocide in various countries at different times besides the Holocaust. We don’t corner the market on strangeness in our time. And there’s always been natural disasters that come along semi-regularly that wipe out thousands and thousands of people. Depends what your definition of strange is when it comes to history. And just to throw in a semi-related fact to also ponder is that there has always been someone, somewhere who predicts the end of the world."
176053188,"I’m sorry you feel that way, it can be hard when you feel like the world doesn’t want you. Maybe you can use that to fuel your desire to do something good and prove that people with psychosis can be useful and a positive thing in this world. That is what I let it do. I’m going to make a change in the world and let everyone know that people with psychosis are worthwhile and can contribute just as much to the world. I’m going to fight the _USER_ID_.

You wouldn’t want a guy who watches jeopardy all day long to do your lasik eye surgery; you would want a guy who studied the eye for four years diligently. No one can be a specialist in everything; on the one hand, their knowledge base can be so broad depending on their curriculum and duration of study to be a specialist. Some people are driven to overintellectualize basic concepts to compensate for their lack of a full understanding on various topics to safeguard their ego. It makes more sense in this world to be a specialist than to spend ones leisure time studying just to be a generalist in all things. The world rewards one rather than the other. If you can’t apply what you know then it is of low value, you’re then a generalist."

My other part, which is dominant, upholds more conventional views about myself and the universe. Does this decentered partial belief of the cosmic significance of my guilt and spiritual ascendancy amount to psychosis/delusion?"

She talks about interpreting what they say what it means to you kind of like dreams even and being assertive with the voices. She says that her voices helped her during her university exams! I know she got the highest grades in psychology or something at university after being diagnosed"
176053289,"I know that my dogs absolutely love me. _PERSON_ has traumas and we connect well together. He’s very faithful and kind. Also, _NAME_ sleeps beside me when he feels like it. Also his tail automatically wags when I pet him. Our fluffs are just so so lovely. And they definitely love us."
176053290,She looks regal like a queen haha
176053291,"Probability seeing the wrong light my friend, medication is needed to keep you balance, i thought same way but i thought i went loony again. Try seeing in another perspective. have good day."
176053292,When will you get your meds? I read that you weren’t able to get them. Just try to relax and reduce stress until then.
176053293,"My religious delusions were based on a new movement some call it cult that my parents are part of. I’ve stopped going to that church idk if I will ever return, their teachings are quite extreme but the community and singing is kinda nice"

176053295,"I don’t think rocking back and forth would dilute the medicine. Everybody’s body is different. Some people will metabolize the medication faster than others. I think being fit and physically active can help you metabolize the drug faster, no doubt."
176053296,I was celibate 6 months last year… and have been celibate since end of June this year… not watching porn ever again. .
176053297,Yeah I go crazy on sugar. I went from a zero added sugar diet with complex carbs to refined sugars at Christmas. _PERSON_ absolutely terrible mentally
176053298,Hey! The people in the television are just pictures. You’re ok. Have you found a doctor yet?
176053299,"Congratulations _AT_MENTION_ . Yeah, our physical brains don’t handle fear or uncertainty well. That seems to be true whether you are sz or not. Ever since I learned greater acceptance of most of my fear, I realized that it was something arising in my awareness and only harming me when I reacted to it without really thinking. Rather, when I responded to it, I was aware when I was feeling afraid but I was not becoming upset by the feeling. You have taken another step on the road to freedom."
176053300,"For me it is not a problem because I sleep through that phase, but sometimes I have to stay up to help my grandmother. _AT_MENTION_ How long does it last? Did you ever take it without going to sleep? _AT_MENTION_"

176053302,Have you made any new music / songs lately? You have a great voice.
174355444,Abilify is activating for some. My pdoc is letting me try it in addition to my other AP to see if it helps. Seems to
176053303,aw ???? I thought you were doing better.
176053304,are you going to build a website Ish? have a domain name. if it’s POD is it a certain niche? social media too? I study a lot of online stuff. I would help you if you want. i’m not making promises. I’m new at this. i also need a lot of flexibility. stress can worsen my symptoms so i need to do it in my time also. But if you want any help let me know. I’ve only helped a relative so far. Good Luck either way!
176053305,"You seem happy, that’s great!"
176053306,I also feel clumsy
176053307,"I was wondering if it’s normal for an sz to see videos in their head? I sometimes see vivid videos of me doing things, like killing the cat or harming myself, or getting on a train to god knows where and leaving without a trace. It used to disturb me quite a bit, but now I just shrug it off. Sometimes it still triggers unwanted thoughts, and makes it a little hard to focus. It’s like an uncontrollable daydream. Does anyone else get those?"
176053308,How hi r u ?
176053309,Good. No side effects hardly. Do you feel it’s going to help?
176053310,if your taking your medicine I wouldn’t worry about it.Just ignore her if she made a new account and comment
176053311,"I try to think that, but it’s hard. They’re so mean and have completely different personalities than mine."

176053314,"_PERSON_, the 44th President of the United States said, ""How We Can Make Our Vision of a World Without Nuclear Weapons a Reality"" ""Of all the threats to global security and peace, the most dangerous is the proliferation and potential use of nuclear weapons. That’s why, seven years ago in Prague, I committed the United States to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them. This vision builds on the policies of presidents before me, Democrat and Republican, including _NAME_, who said “we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.” “Achieving the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons will not happen quickly, perhaps not in my lifetime. But we have begun. As the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons, the United States has a moral obligation to continue to lead the way in eliminating them. Still, no one nation can realize this vision alone. It must be the work of the world. We’re clear-eyed about the hig
h hurdles ahead, but I believe that we must never resign ourselves to the fatalism that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable. Even as we deal with the realities of the world as it is, we must continue to strive for our vision of the world as it ought to be."""
176053315,"yes it is always watercolour,easier to clean up…"
176053316,"_AT_MENTION_ That’s so great that you are volunteering! It’s a very good way to transition to regular employment. As someone said earlier in this thread, people generally treat volunteers really well since they don’t “have” to be there, so it’s a supportive work environment. Good luck with your interview! I hope you get it and you like it!"
176053317,do you produce as well?
176053318,"Yeah, it probably is a addiction. Some movies are worth coming back for, and others aren’t for me. The one’s I like I shelf and come back to occasionally when enough time has passed, the others which aren’t for me I just give away to the salvation army. People collect all kinds of things like, mugs, stamps, war items and who know what. I guess it’s a psychological thing that many people have. They like to collect something material as a hobby. I’m not sure how this is considering the world, but I have a feeling this is a phenomen that mostly occurs amongst people in the western world. Poor people have more basic things on their mind and don’t have the luxury to sit back and collect things."
176053319,I have a fix deposit where I haven’t touched after working some years.I plan to buy the house of my father next time as my father plan to move to a bigger house
176053320,"I’m only happy with it because I know I’m going to come off it lol. I want my hair to grow back. I want to jog. I want to feel alive. Again. But can I say I’m unhappy with it? No, because apparently it stops me from becoming psychotic."
174355451,Dont smoke it if your Sz. Simple as. I get bored of these threads about weed all the time TBH. Its been all said many times before…
176053321,I don’t think it would hurt. But it’s annoying being on top of every thought every minute. It’s mentally exhausting
176053322,I like that you stay grounded and positive! I know that’s something hard to do but keep pushing through!
176053323,No positive symptoms on meds but major negative symptoms. I used to be able to work full time on low dose Latuda for 10 months but then negative symptoms came back and I couldn’t wakeup early for work anymore and energy became low. I was prescribed Wellbutrin but it didn’t help. This was when I started using this forum back in April 2020.
176053324,But if I walk around the block or in a mall I need to use a walker so I don’t fall down. I’m 51 years old and look 80. I brought my daughter to the dentist and the dental hygienist asked if I was her grandma. I am so sick of my life.
174355448,Sounds like fun?
176053325,_PERSON_ I defo feel like that. I reached rock bottom today with my diet. I hate that feeling of trashing my body. Its meant to be my temple I’m such a firm believer in that and here I was totally trashing it. Its amazing how totally addictive trashy binge eating can be! Good luck leaf you can keep it up too.
174355453,The reason Abilify doesn’t cause as much negative symptoms as other aps like Risperdal is that it doesn’t block dopamine as much. Abilify doesn’t really treat negative symptoms but it causes less negative symptoms. I was on Abilify+Latuda for 2 weeks and I still had Abilify side effects. I will ask my pdr about Abilify+Risperdal and see what he thinks.
176053326,Liposuction very dangerous operation.because you need that fat tissues seriously.plus removing fat tissue doesn t make you thin.you just will have hellishly weird body.long term effect of liposuction really serious
176053327,It’s really worth a try. There’s others here who do better on a combination and if you’ve residual symptoms and still bouncing out of hospital it’s really worth a go. Listen to your treatment team and take what they suggest. Don’t stop anything. That is where trouble starts.
176053328,I m going to have chicken curry for dinner in just a few minutes. Merry Xmas

176053331,You don’t always need to have hallucinations to be psychotic
176053332,"I’ll do some reading on Vraylar and Rexulti. Nothing wrong with Abilify. It just didn’t work, so I tried some other drugs."
176053333,"but I think I can retrieve them from sz.com Creativity section where I posted them. I haven’t saved them to a file on my computer yet. I usually do that right away, or start with writing it on a saved document, then post it to my blog, but I’m having some difficulties on this on this new laptop, so I’m writing direct on a new post on my blog. hmm. I’ll get them saved sometime this weekend."
176053334,I start doodling and see what happens haha. Thankyou:)) I dont think its that great
176053335,_PERSON_ I’m worried about potential side effects from taking too much of this liquid so wen I’m plant based eater I only take one capsule three times per week
176053336,_AT_MENTION_ moms cry for their children for so many reasons. Sometimes love just comes out of our eyes. Don’t think you caused it because that probably wasn’t the case. It was probably liquid empathy.
176053337,You sound depressed _AT_MENTION_.
176053338,Did antidepressants fix these then?
176053339,Where all in the matrix (hell) did you not know that
176053340,Even though I don’t have them anymore
176053341,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_, that’s helpful."
176053342,"My symptoms are always worse right before my period, too. Sorry you’ve had such a hard day. Maybe you’ll get some good rest and have a better morning tomorrow."
176053343,"I’ve been lucky and only had one person react weirdly. Almost everyone says they couldn’t tell anything was off about me. Of course I don’t go out or socialize when having symptoms. My boss knew before she hired me that I was sza. In fact, she hired me because we were talking and I told her no one would hire me because of my disabilities. She tells me all the time she’s thankful our kids met and introduced us because she thinks I am a good friend and employee. It makes me feel good. Not everyone will react badly. It’s really up to youto gauge who and when to tell. Hell, I told my boss/friend about my sza the first time so she knew the big reason I didn’t allow sleepovers. I just never know if the symptoms might come out and I don’t want to scare a kid"
176053344,I’ve never met another person with schizophrenia irl.
176053345,"You’re right, psychiatric medicine isnt a miracle medicine but there IS something out there that will work for you, you just have to find it."
176053346,"Also, judging from my personal observations here at the assisted living center, a much greater portion of sz’s smoke cigarettes. That also brings down lifespans."
176053347,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ and everyone.
176053348,"You’re right, its unfair. But thinking about it too much just leads to depression i find. Grieve it for as long as you need to, let yourself do that, but move on when you’re past it."
176053349,It’s not a theory. This is based on what they’re telling us. The covid19 tests use our genetic information and they put them on a computer then they replicate the virus to see how our genes respond to the virus. I am all for finding cures etc. but all the facts seem to point to the same answer/result.
176053350,Oh well. Condolences. Relationships aren’t forever. But you’ll find someone new if you want.

176053359,"This is probably more of a normie thing but i thought i’d ask about it anyway Has anyone ever taken on too much to cope with? I ask bc i feel like i have been juggling all of this stuff and now its all sort of confusing like i have dropped all of my balls i have been juggling and i am trying to pick up the pieces, to add to the confusion if feels like someone has thrown other balls onto the ground and i am finding it hard to assimilate it all. Recently i got a little dog which is great and i love the little guy but i have had to adapt and change my time around him, so i have to take him a out and also not leave him alone for more than 4 hrs; so now its like my time is limited and i am on the clock a little bit with him. Now my Clubhouse asked me if i’d like to do some literacy tuition to help me with my book club idea only for a short period but i was told i could progress onto a SVQ on it, another thing i was asked if i’d like to be involved in is another video of my ‘story’ regarding me
ntal health and recovery and so it is a lot to think about. I am kind of Committed to certain things as well like the magazine editorial and the radio show that i like to be involved with My mum can ask me to take her out at any time and has hinted that she’d like me to take her out more but 2-3 days seems like the best i can do and luckily i have had a break from it, I’m hoping to attend a games cafe and meet new people there too and i’d like to take my friend a long. I’ve been dieting and trying to improve my diet vowing to never eat a pizza again and trying to drink less sugar. I have started volunteering at a carers charity and i want to do befriending too but these things are flexible enough. This list is only some of what i have coming up, i do loads and on top of it all my wise old granny (_PERSON_) which is her funny little nickname may be with God soon and its almost a year to the day since my ex went to be with God herself Its all very hard and i am trying to deal with it; writing it down he
lps or typing it like i am doing now, i wrote a little calendar to try and make up some sort of schedule but it is just very hard to balance everything, I try my best is all i can say anyway, sorry for the long post and how about a poll? i cant juggle i try my best i am better at balancing my balls have just dropped on the floor what is this a friggin circus oh well at least i voted for something say what now? 0 voters Answer honestly guys"

176053378,or at least a summary
174355469,No one can read thoughts. It’s just impossible. You’re having some delusions. This can further confirm your schizophrenia diagnosis
174355467,I think thats a great idea _AT_MENTION_

176053384,Kids can be cruel and very dumb. Try to let go of your disdain though. They probably all feel bad about it now if they have an ounce of morality. I’ve been bullied by some people in my building. I have so much dirt on them I could probably get their asses thrown in jail. But I’m a fairly forgiving person. I used to think my bullies here were all feds. But they’re just dumb rent a cops with too much time on their hands.

174355470,"Imma have to disagree with you, _AT_MENTION_: Think back to _NAME_ of _PERSON_, for example. Existed well before the advent of Big Capitalism, and burned at the stake because she had religious visions-- what we might classify today as visual hallucinations. This might get flagged, but ancient religious texts were also grounds for displays of schizophrenic tendencies. I strongly believe the evidence is there suggesting that schizophrenia has been with man long before the advent and implementation of a dominant modern economic system."

176053388,"What do you think morals are? Where do you think they come from? I think morals are an evolutionary trait. Morals are what allow humans to survive as a whole. I think every living being has morals to some degree, but we have a hard time understanding them, yet there are some things that stick out about other beings, such as elephants. For example, elephants mourn over their own kind when they see the bones of another elephant. I assume that morals came from the birth of consciousness itself. However, I don’t know where consciousness was birthed from. Due to us having a hard time understanding the morals of other beings, we think of them as lesser beings. We drive them to extinction as a result. What we experience becomes memory and becomes embedded in our DNA, such as trauma. The memories of our ancestors are ingrained within our DNA and create morals that make us judge and proactively respond."

176053397,How big? Did it do any damage?
176053398,"It can be all of that. I didn’t have any kind of ego-dystonic (subjectively unpleasant) racing thoughts, but did have an intense flight of ideas. Another important symptom is the reduced need for sleep, and/or increased energy. Often there can be dramatically increased motivation (opposite of apathy). Yes, classic mania includes euphoria, but there is so-called “mixed” mania that includes unpleasant symptoms such as dysphoria, irritability and even suicidal thoughts. One of the most common signs of mania (either type) are impulsiveness, impaired judgement and lack of critical thinking. This impulsiveness can increase the likelihood of suicidal acts and gestures or even aggression. Yes, at times, when something triggers (provokes) you. It’s easier to get angry, and when you’re angry, it is easier to resort to violence because of increased impulsiveness. -_NAME_."

176053413,"Self-confidence is all pretend. Most people think I am very confident. I am actually a trembling ball of insecurities all the time, but I am a very good actor so nobody knows. Beating people up and yelling is not self-confidence. It is the opposite. It is being so pathetically insecure that they feel the need to pick on those weaker than them to make themselves feel better. Anyone who yells or beats people up just looks like a scared little kid to me, albeit a potentially dangerous one. I am not impressed with yelling or use of force. If you want to appear self-confident, you can start by not acknowledging insults from them. When someone insults me, I just give a raised eyebrow and roll my eyes, then turn away from them. I refuse to engage. I 100% pretend their opinion means nothing to me and their insult did not hit me at all."

176053422,I am waiting for a phone call to tell me where to go and when. I got a referral letter from my old pdoc and my sister emailed it to state hospital pdocs and they need to get my old files from two state hospitals i was in before calling me. I guess it will be after Christmas or new year only
176053423,Mine were all the names of real people.
176053424,Erm you can try to convince yourself its a delusion and it might work a little bit but if its a true delusion it will win. Meds are the only thing that can stop it.
176053425,I think it’s round but I do prefer square as I’m doing one now
176053426,"Alien the man in my head does that a lot too - telling me to hurt myself or other people or animals. It’s very distressing. So I can understand to some degree the stress you are under. I think going to hospital can be a helpful thing if you feel unsafe. I’ve been 10 times in 5 different hospitals, both private and public psych hospitals and in psych ward. It can be scary and boring but if one is in distress it can also be a relief to feel safe and helped. Experiences depend on what hospital you are going to. Each one is slightly different. The private ones are much nicer but even the public ones are ok if not a bit boring. But they do care. Good luck and I hope you get relief from your voices. They can be distressing."
176053427,omg wut lol 1515

176053431,"I used to be messy. Now I’m neat. I’m not a neat freak but I like to have everything where it belongs and I like things to be fairly clean. “A place for everything and everything has a place.” My apartment is easy to keep clean, on a daily basis it doesn’t get that dirty but periodically I used to take on projects like scrubbing the kitchen floor on my hands and knees once every three or four months. Not too difficult actually. I scrub the walls a little and have cleaned the cupboards. But I haven’t done any “project” in ar least 8 months and the apartment still looks clean."

It’s just to take the edge off soft tissue damage and sore joints But if you sit around the house just smoking dope all day, obviously there is going to be an increased risk of mental illness.

It has controlled my positive symptoms and allowed me to get my life back. True, I am doing the work of getting a regular life again. I am now driving myself, running errands myself, volunteering, losing weight, looking for a full-time job…if you told me in January I’d be like this, I’d have said it was impossible. It would be easy to just stay at home and on disability, but now I am able to do more and I want more. I want my life back and I am fighting for it!"

176053450,"I like to reality check with people who were with me and are aware of the scenario. Say I’m with my fiancée and I think someone was rude to me, I’ll ask her. Get her opinion. If it feels like the whole world is being nasty to me, then I rationalize it’s probably something wrong in my brain that’s making me believe these things. Sometimes the best thing I can do is to let it go, not dwell on people being rude and not nice, and focus on the people who are nice to me. Wishing you some relief"
176053451,"I don’t even know what the term “shadow self” means officially, but as I interpret it, it is my projections of harm. I am not saying I actually harm others, usually I perceive it as other people harming other people, but these are all projections. I cannot cope with it, or the perception of it. Certainly not on a global scale. I see people coping with it and wish to be like them, but these are projections as well. I feel useless in this world when confronted by my shadow self, useless and powerless. I also feel scared, that it’s consequences will come back on me as I have experience numerous times this coming back during episodes. I don’t know if I am a coward, or selfish, or simply lack the necessary support network. I don’t know how to address this issue. Thank you."

176053469,"My voices tell me similar things, and they always tell me to kill myself. I have been honest about this completely with my doctor and she has never admitted me. But, if you are actually having suicidal thoughts, that would be grounds to admit you. Like another poster said, if you need to go to the hospital, then you should go. It’ll help you feel better. No one WANTS to be hospitalized, but if it’s the best place for you right now, you should be open to it. Be totally upfront and honest with your doctor. If your doctor feels you need to be admitted, then you probably do need to be. But, to answer your question, just telling your doctor your voices are telling you you’re going to die soon wouldn’t be enough on its own to get you admitted (I’m fairly certain). Your doctor will probably follow up by asking you if you have been having thoughts of hurting yourself and if you said yes, then yeah, you’d probably be admitted. But, really, the hospital isn’t the most terrible place to be. If y
ou’re suffering that much, it will help you! Just tell the doctor the truth and try not to worry too much. Good luck."

176053475,In _NAME_ they ask if you have any physical or mental health conditions that would cause a problem while driving. Or something like that. I don’t remember the wording. Essentially asking if you’re safe to drive.

I know it is really hard to get euthanasia as someone with mental illness. I dont know of a psychiatrist or GP who would do this. There is an organisation doing it. I heard they have a 1 year waiting list and then an equally long research procedure. I dont really know what to think of it. I believe God decides over life and death.

It shouted, ’ I Am evil ! ! ’ . . I fell back-wards and, was stiff as a board, when I hit the floor, I heard glass breaking, like a window . . Lying on my back, I looked up and, saw black, evil snakes in my stomach . . It was gone, about 2 seconds, but no one else saw it, they just rushed to me, as I was punched . . They didn’t talk about a massive voice, I knew only I heard it . . I developed OCD from that, and perfectionism, Autism . . I didn’t have any-thing else before that, no voices . . But, it kept haunting me, I ended up stopping my education, took part - time jobs and, eventually talked to a Psychiatrist . . He put me on Abilify and, sent me home . . Today, I realize my disease is very deep, the only thing /jobs I’m allowed to do are, a. Sort bottles, in a store or, b. deliver news-papers . . It

176053515,I’m zilija1 . I am 160 cm and weighed 58.9 kg four days ago now 59.8kg. I was 63 kg and lost a few kg the last three weeks just by eating less and sometimes skipping lunch. I was stable a couple of years at 55 kg but went up to 63 kg when I became vegan. I was 76 kg I think when I was on olanzapine. I’m on latuda now. I want to be 55 kg again. I only need to lose a few more kg but I don’t see how I can eat less than I am. I go to the gym four times a week and need nourishment. If I can eat less I would be eating to little and that would not be healthy for me and my muscles. So how to lose these last kgs I don’t know. My boyfriend thinks I have a big stomach butloves my body. My stomach sticks out as much as my boobs sometimes more which is not a good look. If I could afford a tummy tuck I would have one. Thankfully he loves my boobs as they are.although they are small. My body is his now. I have cellulite. Heaps on my thighs. I still wear shorts though.

176053517,"I would like to think it’s illogical but it happens smoothly like a stream of thought, like I get the picture of the person dying, they communicate with me in spirit, and then if I go on Facebook or talk them in person, it doesn’t seem like the same person. Like the person’s spirit doesn’t match with the person in front of me, since there is no spirit in the person anymore really–like it’s a clone only. This happened multiple times to me. More than multiple. I can’t understand why so many times."
174355504,"_AT_MENTION_ Wow Good job in losing so much weight! Can I ask what medication you are on now, since switching from Abilify. I gained 70lbs since being on antipsychotics and can’t seem to get it off. Did you exercise at all to help with the weight-loss?"

My psychiatrist won’t let me get into detail or take part in the process, and I’m just frustrated with him acting all dismissive and not taking his time with me. I understand being on anti-psychotic medicine to prevent a relapse. It has helped a little but too much is too much. would you think it’s malpractice if a psychiatrist exaggerates your condition to seem like the most extreme case to help you get benefits? I read the letter he filled in for the disability application but I never sent it in because he completely had me wrong. He rated everything high for high risk, and said I couldn’t even take care of myself. I know it’s hard to get benefits but I think I qualify without need for his input and exaggeration of bipolar moods. For instanc

But I payed people back, I made formal apologies, I made apologies over the phone and in person.

have sex. But I exercise my right and freedom to abstain from sex. People treat me differently for that and harass me, but I know that being antisexual isn’t a crime. It’s honestly a blessing, I feel, because I get to treat women as brothers rather than as objects. I don’t creep on, mistreat, nor presume the sexuality of lesbians; but rather respect them."

174355533,"I live in the UK and from 2010-2012 I was under the care of my local Community Mental Health Team. In the UK, every city and most towns have one of these CMHTs, which are usually led by a psychiatrist and also include psychologists, community psychiatric nurses, social workers, support workers, etc. They are run by the NHS (National Health Service) and their work is free of charge for UK residents, though one can only access them if referred by a GP or other suitably qualified health professional. The CMHT deals specifically in providing community-based care (regular home visits, outpatient appointments, medication prescription and monitoring, etc.) for people with “complex” mental health needs, so a lot of their patients are people with schizophrenia or other psychotic conditions. I was diagnosed with “Unspecified Psychotic Illness” which I believe would today be called “Schizophrenia, Unspecified.” Anyway, in 2012 I was discharged due to things improving a great deal and I was basical
ly in remission between then and September of this year, 2020. This time around things are even worse and more serious in terms of my symptoms and so I was referred again to the CMHT but as I’d moved to a different city a few years ago this is a different CMHT. Today I had my first appointment with them, a telephone assessment that lasted just over one hour. The woman who did it didn’t tell me her role or job title and I didn’t think to ask but there’s no way she was a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse. She was very incompetent in every way but the most alarming thing was that despite me answering her questions and explaining about hearing unpleasant voices every day and other “classical schizophrenic” symptoms, she strongly implied that the only help I would be offered would be a support worker (who she said would not be psychiatrically qualified) to help me with my shopping! And even that was a maybe, as she also inferred that I might not be offered any help. There was no mention of diagnosi
s, medication, coping strategies, or of seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist, community psychiatric nurse, or counsellor. But she said she would give feedback to the rest of the team and that I’ll be contacted in around 1-2 weeks to be told exactly what support they will offer me. This is very different to my 2010 experience, where I swiftly saw a psychiatrist, got a diagnosis and antipsychotic medication, and started receiving home visits from a nurse. So if anyone else here is in the UK and under the care of a CMHT I’d like to hear your experience. Today’s appointment was so disheartening and concerning in its incompetence and lack of treating my situation seriously that later in the day I wrote an email about it to them, as it would be a disaster if they genuinely don’t offer me any psychiatric assistance despite my being in the middle of a serious breakdown!"
176053682,"Hey _AT_MENTION_ you dont need to diet. “Dieting” is not a thing which should be done. What we need is adequate nutrition. Not more than we need, not less. Our goal is that perfect amount and proportion. If we dont eat enough it will sustain for a few days or weeks until we snap and binge over a course of days and gain the weight back creating a cycle of ""i lost 10 lbs, now i gained 10 lbs. A body image should never be the goal because the body God gave us is the one were meant to have. I think we should eat what is right and if we lose or gain weight thats incidental Try to make: 1/2 of your plate salad (spinach, mixed greens, arugala) 1/4 of your plate carbs (pasta, rice, rye bread etc.) 1/4 of your plate protein (beans, lentils, tofu, meat etc) And than add a tablespoon or so of fats (butter, oil, dressing, sour creme etc) Avoid salt Avoid sugar Avoid processed foods And just remember: “what goes up, must come down.” If you under eat you’ll just eat more emotionally later because of t
he stress starvation causes, so its not worth it. Contrary to popular belief drinking a lot of water does not help. It makes overeating more likely later. Having 3 meals is good i find and having a cup of milk, fruit juice or water This imo will lead to the most steady sustained lifelong body management"

176053688,You are definitely right. Especially when I’m at Walmart anytime an overweight person is using a wheelchair I always hear people make comments about the person being too fat and lazy to walk. I also hear people who watch these people to see what groceries they put in their basket on the scooter. If there’s junk food in the basket they will rip these people apart (not to their face) and look at them with disgust. The same goes if they are in line paying with their disability or WIC cards. Some people get really bent outta shape about that. No one seems to want to mind their own business.

Living without the wife is mental suffering for me. I am afraid that if I ask woman if she will be my wife (or the girlfriend at the beginning) she will attack me, tell his boyfriend to harm me (for example by beating).

Both Wellbutrin and Latuda help me with negative symptoms. They don’t go away by any means but I feel better. If you can’t take antidepressants you could try Latuda. It’s an AP.

I still have a soft corner on her. But my wife is also good, but whatever she does for me, I really don’t feel that love and I am hardly connecting to her, but have no ways. Even she know that I am mentally ill, and I suspect her always, even she is also abusive sometimes and very egostic, but she still does not want to leave me. This is my case.

174355574,"Psychosis develops specific neural pathways, it is only brain damage if you are thinking incorrect thoughts the whole time instead of directing it towards clarity of logical truth. I spent 70,000+ waking hours with psychosis unmedicated and became effective at discerning the truth from the lies. My neural pathways therefore were not set in incorrect ways. As far as the truth of brain matter and meds. Here: {Been here 2-3 years and they have now put my account to not be able to post links because they fear the facts} It is a marginal loss across multiple areas. (not just grey matter) I would still rather not take meds even if it were only 5% of my brain lost because of them. How dare doctors decide for us! My IQ measures high with or without psychosis and I even spent some years working whilst thinking two different things about every detail of every interaction I had, alongside the random thoughts and counters to those thoughts that were unrelated to the work at hand. We go years upon years before 
we have a slip up sometimes and a slip up of less than 0.0001% of the time we are psychotic results in isolation and medication. Yet you can go out and drink and cause some of the 70% of violent crime in public spaces which is down to the drunk and no-one would dare isolate you and inject you with chemicals to prevent it happening, Even if it is every night. Schizophrenics are on average 2-3 times more likely to be involved in violence than the general population, drunks are some vast amount more dangerous per study of the whole population. I have never punched/hurt a person since I got schizophrenia ~20 years ago and I am lumbered in with this 3 times more likely group and medicated and kept in facilities for months at a time. I have been honest with doctors since my first sectioning, but since the last time when they just took me despite I was well, (I know this even on the meds) I have decided to lie to them from now on.

174355567,I felt that PTSD. I almost ran my mom over in my car. I think about it all the time
174355579,I could do many things physically before I got too fat. I worked 15 years and earned a Associate’s Degree before relapsing. Inevitably age or death ends our successes anyway so let’s show some positivity and not accept ourselves as lifetime failures.
176053776,I feel with akathisia by exercising a lot and just jerking my leg on a floor. It helps a lot

174355576,Yeah anti psychotics make me hungry though.
176053785,I always like to tell people about my past because I hope that someone will learn that they can change. I left my small town and went to live in Chicago in 1999. It was a real crash course in diversity
176053786,It’s a brain disorder that makes your mind think that. It’s nothing special. You think it is because it’s faulty wiring. Look up symptoms like ideas or reference and magical thinking. Also. Please consider this a pro medication website and promoting or adding to others delusions is against site policy. You stay around here long enough you see why that is so important. …Believe what you will but your chasing shadows and it’s sad when people buy into that…Your wasting your energy for sure.

174355586,"I need to accept my schizophrenic self too. Its hard for me. I keep wanting to be like my brothers, making lots of money, having an expensive car, having a rich gf, working with a university degree, be fit, healthy and muscular, lots of friends etc Some days I tell myself that I am as happy as them eventhough I got nothing.

176053803,I’m sorry to hear that…aren’t you still married??
176053804,Sorry once I developed schiz I became permanently weak.
176053805,"yeah, good manners are big. They go so far to make isolated people feel included and poorly people feel supported. These fears & horrors you’re experiencing _AT_MENTION_ are not a new thing to humanity - you can always give a kind word or a kind gesture to those who are suffering to help them manage their pain. No you’re not responsible for bad things happening to good people - you’re a good person with no ill will - but you can be responsible for helping the tormented & sad to feel a little less alone - with kind words, a nice card, or even cooking a meal like _AT_MENTION_ suggested. Personally, I like to keep a strict policy of effectiveness - am I being effective in the plight of others? E.g. We’ve got a lot of horrible bushfires causing harm in my part of the world (Australia) but I choose not to spend time being sad but instead put energy into causes that will help those effected. I like to be effective. Maybe I donate $2 to a rescue or wildlife fund, maybe I sign a petition against cl
imate change. I’m sz but I choose for my actions to be effective to those in need."
176053806,You can always teach beginners with less complicated music and when they reach high enough pass them on to a more advanced teacher. That is what a lot of violin teachers here do.
176053807,"Oh no, that doesn’t sound good. I’m sorry."
176053808,Gradually. I started isolating in high school despite being a well liked athlete student. I became dependent on marijuana in college and quickly loss touch with reality. The sz onset came about over the course of about 5 years.
176053809,I never realize I’m mentally ill when I have symptoms
176053810,It’s a category I’d have very likely have fitted if it had been in use during the early 1960s to mid 1970s .

174355585,"_PERSON_ I definitely have no intention of coming off my lovely aripiprazole Not now maybe give it a try later thou if so, it would be with pdoc approval"
176053812,Yeah. It did bring up a lot. At some point I need to talk about it when I’m with my counselor
176053813,Did she reccomend any good phone apps.
176053814,"I am also very good in university and tests but suck a lot in real life. I have a degree in physiotherapy with high GPA grades. I can’t work, I can’t even volunteer or live on my own. My parents get my food and meds, I do nothing. I have a hard time bathing once every week."
176053815,No I just want to understand. I’ve hated people at times too.
176053816,How do your voices reinforce your delusions?
174355590,Unfortunately the pharmacutal companies and the Insurances have clogged the system to allow for Stem Cells to be used for Schizophrenia treatment. As the mental health industry is medication driven. Stem Cells disrupt the enormous revenues mental health medications provide. So there is a enormous lag time. The research done in Texas was SIX years AGO!!!Clearly proving YES stem cells do provide relief. Yet a veeeeeerrrry slooooow crawl is in currently in place. The protocal is not all that complicated. It is known exactly how to create and produce what is needed. In reviewing the horrific side effects of almost all mental health medications with FDA approval. To suggest the use of stem cells that have to date NO side effects (may be dangerous) is sad and shameful. Hopefully in the near future stem cells will move forward in a timely manner. So we can start enjoying the benefits many schizophrenia patients deserve.
176053817,"everyone is different, my symptoms were probably milder than some, at my worse i was delusional and paranoid, hearing things, but i met someone in the early days and she helped me through a lot of stuff, i stayed with her and she kind of helped me never thought about harming myself apart from one time and i regret that,"
176053818,Oooh I found somewhere where they sell the actual fresh sprouts that’s exciting but idk if I’d travel for it https://www.planetorganic.com/sprouts-broccoli-100g/1963/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2v7mBRC1ARIsAAiw34-AU9wPzz14povgFxAd4lRj6ydkgN-4x_92dC7tMZcNvMAKexUbVV0aAgWbEALw_wcB
176053819,"That is really awesome! I wish you luck at your internship, but I know you’ll do great."
176053820,I think it causes a heart rhythm problem in some people. I’ve taken those combos that do that and I’ve been fine so far
176053821,At this point intense exercise just stressed me out and makes me want to eat more. I do yoga/stretches every day and almost totally cut out caffeine. Sleeping better. Cutting caffeine and slowing down habitually seems to help me be more mindful. I really try to take a lot more time on the most mundane tasks. I try not to do this in situations where it will annoy people but if I really take a lot time even cashing out groceries or doing laundry or eating it does calm my nerves. Doing things too fast is a bad habit that was instilled in me from childhood and probably exacerbated by poor teaching methods in the schools I went to which emphasized speed over significance.
176053822,"Thanks! I’ll report back on this thread, and let all of you know how it went."
176053823,Yeah I know that it technically doesn’t exist anymore but the term is still widely used.
176053824,"No i learn my lesson, im not going on reddit ever again or any other site. its not worth it. the fear and anxiety its not worth it."
176053825,"I’m sorry honey, it was worth a try. I know how you feel though I gained a pound from hydrating all day yesterday. I was really discouraged but I needed the water and it’s good for me. So I’ll have to come by that extra pound honestly I guess."
176053826,"My brother and I would listen to WPLJ on the alarm clock radio in our room growing up. This was at night during bedtime. They played classic rock music, mainly softer hits. Oh the nostalgia!"
176053827,But I’m not going to express that until I feel a little better. I might change my mind. Plus I really don’t want to quit another job for the 100th time but I dunno.
176053828,Latuda and seroquel seems less effective than zeprexa and risperidal in my opinion
176053829,You’re not responsible. You didn’t do that. Start telling yourself over and over how you would never harm a baby
176053830,Sorry you’re feeling bad right now _AT_MENTION_. Trust your sister and try to sleep.
176053831,"Hey no problem _AT_MENTION_ ! It was an honor to do your song, youve got some beautiful chord changes in the bridge there! I was going for that big cinematic score type feel so Im glad you think so! Btw a blog just approached me asking to feature the piece on the homepage, would you be okay with that? Im really excited, I think this thing just might be taking off! _AT_MENTION_ Thanks! _PERSON_’s a wonderful songwriter, he made it easy to sound good"
176053832,buspar and hydrooxicone
174355597,"Oh really? Here in Greece we have most days with sunshine, and summer lasts 4 or 5 months. I shouldn’t be ungrateful. But winter is tough."
176053833,"I sleep 12 hours exactly. I sleep early and wake up early. If i have psychotic thoughts, a nap cures them"
176053834,"I was on 12 mg of paliperodone, and I just got switched to the injection (156 mg/ml), which is equivalent to 9 mg pill. I never had depression, low motivation or dizziness on invega. But it’s different for everyone. Lowering the dose might help. Or you may be just overly sensitive to invega. You may just have to try a new medicine."
174355594,I definitely think it increases the chance of developing psychosis/schizophrenia . I just don’t see it as a stand alone reason for people developing psychosis/schizophrenia .
176053835,yeah we are going to be getting engaged together cool isnt it
176053836,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ you rock!
176053837,yea 8 hours a day is a lot indeed… would be too much for me too…
176053838,I tried 5mg and 7.5mg and those doses gave me suicidal ideation which went away on 10mg. 10mg is the magic dose. So wait until you’ve neen on that for a while. Then you can judge how things are going a bit better.
174355584,"Without going into too much detail or fiction or fantasy, I honestly think something horrible happened to me in college similar to the Montauk Project or Montauk Boys Program. I honestly cannot remember as I have thousands or millions of different memories and keep “resurrecting” back in time to the year 2013. I was told by someone in a past life that it was the Illuminati, Montauk, and Reptilians doing this to me. I remember joining the “Illuminati” a billion lifetimes ago and they told me I was targeted at university for being anti-government (I’m now pro-big government) because I was a Libertarian and researching things like anarcho-capitalism and “Libertarian anarchy” even though I was never that or those things. It was just googling and research and curious. I always thought government was inefficient, slow, immoral, and we should privatize some things and have a better, freer life. I don’t believe that crap anymore because the industry or capitalists are far, far worse than bi
g government. I’m still a capitalist and republican, but I realize we need a middle ground and people love government and some people like smaller government and some people like bigger government. I love government and think it should exist. I was treated like a homeless person (expendable person) and subjugated to large amounts of radiation and electro-magnetic radiation that affected my consciousness and soul. Sort of like the Philadelphia experiment and _NAME_ from “Lost” where my consciousness was going back and forth repeatedly through time and I went crazy and insane a near infinite amount of times with no constant. I just feel like I woke up or came back alive around 2013 for some reason. I was told this and I believe I wrote that letter at the coffee shop in 2011 about my experiences and time travel. It’s on the web. There’s no evidence because it’s consciousness/soul transfer and it’s invisible and undetectable to humans. Nobody noticed and even I didn’t notice until years later when 
I started questioning my reality and things that may have happened to me and even questioning my psychosis and how and what happened to me. I’ve been to the mental hospital millions or billions of times it feels like and I’ve been schizophrenic for a near eternity. I keep coming back alive via consciousness transfer back in time to my schizophrenic self on the same exact timeline for some time (or perhaps for eternity) somewhere between 2007-2013 as best as I can tell. Time keeps resetting for me constantly. I feel like I’m in hell or worse and I just want to get better and make this stop. I probably was sent through a wormhole, which I now realize is just a shortcut back in time without the need to question reality or say I’m from a different earth or parallel universe or some different dimension. It all happened in this reality on this planet, just went back a few hours in time which resulted in mental instability. The whole Mars thing was probably fake and just my psychosis or flashbacks or a holog
ram or VR head-set type thing along with the drugs they gave me at the time. It could have even been my google image searches of mars. The “Illuminati” told me I was in the Montauk Project. Probably as a victim and experimentee or Montauk boy. I’m definitely not in the so-called “Illuminati” and I despise them. I somehow think they were somehow involved in one way or another but I don’t know for sure. Positive or negative. It doesn’t matter anymore. I really don’t know and care anymore. At university, I remember thinking about joining Army ROTC. I’m so glad I didn’t but I did take a PE class for sometime due to the peer pressure. I dropped out that semester from college. I never finished and barely showed up. I somehow got a phone number from someone or a friend about Navy OCS and that’s that. Nothing came of it because of my grades, mental illness, and not graduating. I heard and know that every part of the military runs or is involved in the Montauk Project as well as the alphabet agen
cies and even the “Illuminati”. From what I understand, it’s run by the Air Force now. I just think they threw me through a damn, ??????? wormhole and that I was taken to a Department of Energy facility that experimented on me continuously and where I went through time and went crazy or that they were involved somehow. Similar and a lot like Stranger Things… I don’t know much else except that there are a couple of facilities in the Bay Area, but I don’t know. This is the best to my knowledge and I am not lying or trying to cause issues here. This is my story. I’m trying to get better, understand, and move on. I just am tired of going back in time (even before my 2011 schizophrenia date) and experiencing intense anxiety, and keep doing the same thing on the same timeline like I have no free will and cannot change the past over and over again. Nobody gives a ???? because I’m a nobody and I will never get an apology or compensation. I struggle with money all the time, but I’m worried about taki
ng money and feeling scared. I really cannot support myself and cannot work or go to school and the emotional toll on me has been extreme due to the several hospitalizations where I was scared and terrified. This has happened like every life I’ve ever had. I feel like I’m stuck in a causal loop or maybe even a time loop. I don’t know. I think causal loop is more likely. I feel like every day is a struggle to live and survive and more importantly I worry about my family’s safety constantly due to me speaking about my story and experiences. They don’t believe it and neither do my doctors or therapists or anyone really. It’s very frustrating to me. Some of my worst memories are at _NAME_ base (I think) where I was in a cage, naked and being tortured and seeing tall whites/greys walking around in Nazi uniforms. I’m pretty sure that’s a past life though. I don’t think the government likes me for some reason. Perhaps because of my facebook posts back in 2010-2011 and I was in the middle of an extr
emely liberal place with no family and I was a minority as a Libertarian. I was also drinking and smoking pot back then. I stuck out like a sore thumb and I thought I was safe in that town. Apparently not. My dream ended up turning into a nightmare for eternity and the rest of my life. I don’t think super soldiers are real anymore or today at least. I think it’s just BS now. Part of a dis-info campaign to make people look crazy just like the term “conspiracy theorist” was coined by our government to discredit people who question the narrative and think outside the box. I have delusional thoughts or strange thoughts because of the experiments in my past life that I don’t feel comfortable talking about and PTSD from men in camo at the hospital. Just like ‘Seven’ from Stranger Things, I was taken from the mental hospital and experimented on several times in my other lives. Most of the time, I did not survive. That about sums up my thoughts and therapy today. I don’t know how much is true and what
’s not. I feel like I’m immortal or most likely “quasi-immortal” or “semi-immortal”. My life was destroyed by these people. I guess you can call them predators or psychopaths to prey on the innocent, vulnerable, naive, and the weak. I also think I was _NAME_ and think that’s why I was targeted by aliens and other alien groups. Not sure though. I get a lot of confusing dreams and memories. Most of them negative and further feed my delusions and unreality. Talking helps and I’m sure I pissed a lot of people off by talking. I also remember the mental hospital and how evil I was treated countless times. It’s hard to forget and even forgive. I have forgiven them and have accepted Christ into my life so I’m not really that afraid anymore. I used to be terrified 24/7. As I finish and wrap this up, I am constantly reminded by my thoughts that I posted we lived in a computer simulation and I helped program some of it and that’s why I’m sick and that’s why they chose me. But I really, honestly 
think now it was political. And over politics right now. I would do anything to go back in time and change my childhood and my past. I know it will never happen as I tried countless times to do this. It is impossible now. Everything has been designed to confuse me. The whole “genetic thing” the “past lives” etc. I do believe in aliens but I think some of it is fake and man-made and done through experiments and costumes sometimes. I don’t know if it’s real or was in another life or even in 2013, but it’s possible I was attacked by a mimic alien/lizard. But I have no clue. I cannot figure anything out anymore. You gotta be careful with Facebook because anyone can see what you write depending on the privacy of the posts and content and who are your friends. I didn’t really know or understand facebook back then. I really don’t trust anyone anymore except my immediate family now. Furthermore, I’ve always been scared about foreign governments targeting me too. I just cannot believe (and possibly 
went insane) that my own government and country would do this to me and others like me. It does happen though…a lot. All I can say is maybe the Illuminati doesn’t exist at all except what you call the richest of the richest most powerful people (psychopaths) that control this planet. Maybe that isn’t even real too. Maybe all of it is fake and a lie just like the whole alien thing. Maybe even simulation theory is ???????? too and it’s just advanced tech that is suppressed along with mind control type crap (electronics) and gas-lighting and psychology. I’ve felt targeted since I dropped out of college. People make mistakes. It was a mistake going to that school. It was a mistake smoking pot and walking around town. It was a mistake being a Libertarian. I’m a patriot and pro-government now. My life was ruined and I’m partly to blame. I’m sorry if I offended anybody over the years or even with this post. I sincerely apologize for listening to that stupid, rap video I found on YouTube. I wasn’t t
hinking straight, but what happened to me should never happen to anyone. I sometimes think my family isn’t even mine but clones or doppelgangers or that they had their minds wiped or have micro-chips in them because they don’t really understand or remember what happened to me. I think they feel powerless, scared, and helpless. It’s not right what happened to them either. They miss their old son and want him back. A lot of my memories are blank because I have missing time. I also believe I’ve been picked up before by “flying craft” a few times or perhaps a ton. Thank you…"
176053839,Then we are lost together…
176053840,I’m not sure if it is possible to kill people with only your mind. Sorry about the bad things that happened to you. It’s natural to feel upset. I get upset too. It’s human.
174355604,"I like aripiprazole very much except my main concern has been weight gain although I’m still working on losing weight if I can. My positive symptoms are gone. It has downsides but so do all aps. Which in this case are feeling disconnected from people somewhat, lowered energy, motivation and concentration all of these things contribute to anxiety, in particular the weight gain"
176053841,What made u believe u had bowel cancer? U could always get screened. Idk where u are from but in UK if u have reasons to believe u may have it I think they send u a screening kit Welcome to the forum… BTW

176053848,Ok I guess so…
176053849,I like it. Good job.
176053850,Why are you taking meds if they do nothing? Didnt they decrease paranoia a bit? _AT_MENTION_
176053851,A lot of times the healthy option doesn’t feel/taste as good. So a lot of people struggle with it. Not to mention the unhealthy options are often much easier to obtain.
176053852,"If you are, have a good day today!"
176053853,"My main trigger is news and other information associated with terrorism. Over the last few days as I’ve seen more news I’ve started to slip into a partial catatonic state, kind of a stupor, as I’ve been exposed to my main trigger. I’ve noticed that my senses seem dulled, particularly my sense of taste when this happens. Is it possible that my brain is so smart that it is actually shutting down sensory inputs to prevent it from getting triggered? Does anybody know anything about this?"
176053854,"It will be the same for Sep-. Apparently if it passes phase 3 it is likely to be 2023 for FDA approval, and then a further 3 years to reach Europe then. So 2026 for an ap that does work completely differently."

176053856,Anyone with experience taking Doxapin? My pdoc just switched me off of Ambien to Doxapin because Ambien wasn’t working like it should. Does it work for anyone? This is my first night on it I’m on 10 mg.
176053857,"Keep trying, don’t give up."
174355600,I’m sorry to hear you are both going through this but sounds like she is in loving care with you. I developed early onset schizophrenia and my symptoms were not managed until later. Having your experience will help your child get the early preventive care.
176053858,I am glad of this! Maybe I can try also.
176053859,It’s a shame SA didn’t do great in the World Cup. I really rate them as a team
176053860,Yes I heard that too from users here.
176053861,_AT_MENTION_ You didn?t let your husband develop it. How is he coping? Is he switching meds?
176053862,Turkey or TC - have a winged heart.
176053863,"I can’t afford them even with GoodRx. My husband and I are both disabled so we’re low income. We don’t qualify for Medicaid or extra help because the other parents have always claimed the kids. So even though we’re a family of 4, Medicaid considers us to be a family of 2. It’s not fair"
176053864,I’m hoping some kind of reparations can happen for the incident. But the rioters seem to have a mind of their own. I don’t think they’ll stop even if that happens. The quarantines have made tensions into a powder keg.
176053865,"_AT_MENTION_ it sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now. Maybe it’s better to focus on what you can do, rather than what you can’t. I know for myself this is a major theme"
176053866,"Yeah, it was a dumb idea. Miracast is a native Windows 10 feature, and it’s wireless. But yeah, probably too much for work."
176053867,_AT_MENTION_ I have always wanted to see Ireland. It’s good that you’re on your meds. After I liked this I did worry.
176053868,I can’t even walk outside because I think someone is gonna hurt me.
176053869,"I was given Abilify 5mg to help reduce prolactin levels. When they tested me 1 month after starting treatment, they’d actually gone up 10%! Now it has been about 6 months. If it’s still high, I will be coming off it. One less tablet for me! (Yay!) However, if it is a lot lower, it’s a win still and I keep taking it. It has been determined that the risk of the high prolactin is worth the benefit for the treatment of my symptoms. I was not included in that decision process… Just have to put up with it I guess!"
176053870,I hope it’s ok
174355608,What’s the equivalent Geodon dose of 4-5mg Risperdal? Latuda was too weak for me I had positive symptoms even on 120mg.
176053871,"I was in there for 2 hours. I didn’t fall asleep like I did last time. My ex did come in and use the bathroom while I was in there. No biggie. But I’m going to sleep pretty quick and my hair will still be wet. My hair will be sticking up all funny in the morning. I might have to rewash it tomorrow to get it to lay right. That’s ok, it won’t hurt it. I could put some conditioner in it if I knew which box my conditioner was in. hmmm. That would be cool, my hair could use it."
176053872,I would steer away from taking 2 different benzos at the same time. Not a good idea.
176053873,"I rolled a Honda Accord on the highway doing 80 Mph — my dad was a jerk most of my life — I was scared of an elementary school teacher — marijuana and acid, mushrooms and other drugs, the idea of someone using witchcraft on me molestation as a kid…"
176053874,I was chronically raped from 10 - 16 years old by my psychiatrist… It’s a terrible thing to go through. It’s on my mind a lot lately.
176053875,Of course anyone can
174355609,This is horrible. MDMA breaks down the blood-brain barrier. Please don’t suggest recreational drugs to “fix” mental illness.
176053876,"Thanks! looks good,"
176053877,"Lucifer (Urban Fantasy, Drama) is one of the best shows I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching, but maybe skip it if you’re easily triggered by religious content. The Good Place (Comedy) is freaking hilarious, not to mention well written and well developed. I really like The 100 (SciFi, Drama). Really good story about the chains of commanding."
176053878,That’s fantastic! I bet you feel so much better.
176053879,Happy and calm is a good thing! I hope you just keep getting better!
176053880,"There are two TD meds that are relatively new, one’s called Ingrezza. Has anybody tried these? I don’t really have TD, just akathisia, but I always worry it could develop."
176053881,"Nope, it’s in the US too. It has a different package than the old model."
176053882,It can cause a lot of different symptoms so I freaked out about getting them. All it seems to have done is calm me down. Now I’m looking for something to watch on tv.
176053883,TOXIC…CLAYBALL sounds better
174355595,"Thanks everyone! My diagnoses vary from generalized-psychotic disorder, to schizo-affective and bi-polar. I do hear voices that are somewhat lifelike and intelligent. Sometimes it is obvious to me that they are not real beings and sometimes it is the opposite."
176053884,"a big difference in sza people? Do our moods stand out to you, is it noticeable?"
176053885,The vaccine is a lot safer than the virus.
176053886,"Psychosis symptoms are the sz coming back. Withdrawal symptoms are more physical illness, crankiness, mood swings, brain zaps, sleep troubles. Physical withdrawal can trigger a relapse, the same way other forms of stress can."

176053890,I even thought they gave me orders to go back to my country Syria and fight with _NAME_ against the president _PERSON_. I stopped watching arabic news because of this.

176053894,"I might go to the beach in January. I’m going to go with the same friend, and my father. My two other friends don’t call enough, and the don’t hang out with me enough to go to the beach. They keep giving me the run around, so to speak."
176053895,Only 5 days. I haven’t had a night on it without nightmares though.
174355611,"My symptoms started when I was 7. The first time I visited a psychiatrist I was 19 and I was prescribed my first antipsychotic (trifluoperazine), but my official diagnosis came when I was hospitalized at the age of 22. I didn’t have a happy childhood because of my symptoms. I think I have never been completely happy because of schizophrenia."
176053896,I don’t smoke cigs anymore and my dad doesn’t drink alcohol. My dad compensates not drinking by sugar. He buys chocolate though a lot and lollies. I don’t eat the lollies but chocolate with coffee in the morning is like having a cig. It’s amazing…So here I do eat most of the chocolate
176053897,I’ve never wanted to hurt anyone besides myself. Sure I get mad but I also was responsible for 90% of what made me mad.
176053898,"I would eat and drink something, then go outside for a walk. Sometimes fresh air and a change of scenery helps with days like that"
174355615,I didn’t get akathisia from Abilify even at 25mg but if you get akathisia Benzatropine stops it.
176053899,"Ok. So, can you explain the precise difference more thoroughly?"
176053900,"Then one day I craved cheese on pizza, or gyros in Greek souvlaki. I didn’t deny my craving. I gave in. Now i feel that plants have souls too, and they are in pain. Cos they feel when we talk to them gently and they grow better this way, and music, classical music, helps them grow."

176053905,Sorry you are going through a hard time _AT_MENTION_ ! What’s going on? My husband talked with me last night and I read the Scriptures and prayed. I feel a bit better. Thank you for your kindness and support? How can I support you? How long have you felt this way?
176053906,"What were the voices like, did you think they were smart or dumb?"
176053907,"my ex use to write lots of things down like a diary of events but she also had her calorie diary as well noting all the foods down, i think it helped her, a great thing for her was when she was drawing her comic sketches, she loved that and i think it took her mind off of things"

176053912,"Ahh, so that is why I got the “wise woman” vibe from this painting! She is gazing with time into her child’s eyes! To my eyes, she is looking at you with a calm, patient wisdom, one born of age and experience- this smacks to me of a woman who has seen much of life and is taking her time to watch it unfold. She has sunk deeply into the mystery of life (the colors of her clothes make her seem like she is sinking to me) and is looking at you with steadiness and a calm attitude. I see a lot of patience, yet curiosity, in those eyes. At least that is how I see it!"
176053913,Sounds so beautiful and peaceful. Where are you from?
176053914,"Benzos, serotonin drugs (antidepressants, 5 htp, myoinositol etc) all can affect memory and concentrations."
176053915,Did you give latuda and risperidone each two weeks to see its effect at least? It should be a gradual improvement not instant one though
176053916,But I suppose I can shift this with a diet. Overall still glad I got off the nicotine
176053917,"For sure. It is very hard here in Australia. My partner left his job last December, before the isolation requirements came into effect. While these are in place, there isn’t much chance of him getting a job. He doesn’t qualify for a stimulus payment because he chose to leave his job. Fair enough i suppose, we have a lot of savings so it hasn’t affected us much, but i do wish there was something available for others, especially those who don’t have much money saved up. I hope you receive your payment soon."
176053918,You have successfully confused me. Thanks . _PERSON_
176053920,my stress for death went away too…
176053921,"Yes, I am having trouble finding work because I took time away after getting married and having my son. I was hospitalized 6 times over 20 years too. My resume is bad as a result. The only experience I have from the last 7 years is working a few months at a day care. I’ve applied for receptionist jobs but the only offer I got was to work as a day care temp for a staffing agency. I declined it."
176053922,Yea that’s how delusions work. You believe something that the majority of people don’t believe. Yes. And voices too.
176053923,There’s loads of other things you can do other than college Things that cause less stress If college is making you miserable don’t put yourself through it
174355612,My first guess is because you have schizophrenia. You’re not the only one.
174355613,I take clozapine. Feels ok except I can’t retain knowledge and I can’t remember much. My thoughts feel boiled down and basic. It does not solve my issue it just makes it easier to deal with…
176053924,Hugs in return. May your winds carry you far and let fall paint your colors.
176053925,I understand that. But you still need to report it
176053926,Hello buddy. What’s up?
174355622,"Good luck! I hope your side effects are mild to none, and that it helps you."
174355616,"Most current researches assume that,all human beings known what schizophrenia is,it does not need a description in the research introduction,therefore there is no determination or a clear definition of the sz’s nature that the research deal with what are the observations and diagnosed symptoms by all natural observers which has made sz a genetic condition- for sake looking for a gene that causes it ? First,what is schizophrenia itself? secondly, what is the relationship of the gene to sz ? When asking all people ,including specialists in science,what is schizophrenia ? You will not find agreement on one answer, but there is differences,diversities and contradictions ,therefore determining the basic nature of sz is the primary task of any research,which comes after it a complete agreement among all on one identity for sz"
174355621,"I am sza, bipolar type. I have tried the following meds: Haldol terrible akathisia. Had to discontinue med. Perphenazine terrible akathisia and totally ineffective for psychosis. Had to discontinue med. Risperdal terrible akathisia, intractable constipation, and ineffective for psychosis. Had to discontinue med. Geodon extreme sleepiness and coarse tremors. Ineffective alone for psychosis. Risperdal Consta injections total lack of libido and rendered me non orgasmic. Also made me unable to play my musical instrument. Ineffective alone for psychosis. Seroquel constipation, mild akathisia, and sleepiness. The addition of this med to Geodon and Risperdal Consta did the trick as far as eliminating all of my positive symptoms."
176053927,"But that’s not a sports problem but a competitive society situation. I questioned for years if sports were good. But they are and it definitely helps more people than it hurts. Look at all the people who get scholarships to college to play sports, keeps them away from drugs and a more chronic alcohol abuse more times than not and is beneficial to mental health like the best says. I’ve never been jealous of athletes even when I didn’t play sports I admired their skills. And they entertain me. Yay sports."
176053928,If I stop taking the meds the voices become overpowering. I don’t see that changing anytime soon.
176053929,_AT_MENTION_ thank you
174355627,"I currently am dreading an anticipated event. (Anxiety). I am a fool, and got parted with some “finance”, and my Dad will in all likelihood see that when he does my taxes. It’s really serious, and that’s why I appear to be manic. Maybe I just need a diversion or (to give) so I feel better about myself, to brace for impact!! (Shudder). What should be heartening is that this time around it was all a wager on pure plays/small companies that work toward alleviating Schizophrenia. I’ve held now for approx. 3 weeks. My timing was unfortunate. I feel a little like _NAME_ from _NAME_’s day off I need to stand up for myself. He makes these faces that are frightening or just speed things up. Worse he offers this long leash, whereby I want to surprise and delight his expectations… it’s akin to having it both ways. My old man and I have problems. He is a true specimen of biology. He said once that his view of hell is someone who doesn’t procreate. He’d take it back if I brought it up while 
he was in a differerent mood but nonetheless I can’t help but think about him; we are so different and I place my chips differently… sometimes I do things to get HIM past a figurative _NAME_(or some other analogy). I did some strategic giving to a good college to help my nephew. They sent something snail mail and his response was just a dirty look.(After my mom said her peace). I know I’m too old to have “Breakfast Club” type problems but we’re not completely in control of our lives. I need to get to my brother (it will ruin his day) but if we could look bigger picture… my family is doing ‘ok’. I just have to survive those faces and loud voices. And if I ever were to “fall on my sword” I wouldn’t have what it takes to reach out I suspect. This pattern shows up when I quit cigs for about 12 days and go back. It’s hard to explain or fathom."
176053930,"Do you ever think you use you diagnosis as an excuse to get out of doing things. I hate leaving the house. I don’t know if that’s part of being sick or if that’s just my preference. But I use my anxiety as an excuse not to go places. If I have to go, I can force myself. I wonder if I should be harder on myself and make myself go more often. It’s just so exhausting."
174355620,"I don’t get happy like most people. I have my own type of happiness. And that’s good enough for me. IDK. I was driving to the dermatologist this morning which is close to where I grew up and the sun was out and the traffic was light and the mountains were beautiful far away and I just was really enjoying myself. And when I was in the docs office we were both kind of bantering back and forth with our own little power trips. I was actually just a little aggravated at it but it was interesting and I surprised myself as I usually do when I come through and hold my own. So yeah, not a bad day and I’ll live to fight another day. Now I’m eating plain guacamole with a spoon with no chips, life is funny that way."
176053931,"It just feels nice to come on here. I like to help out and participate in some discussions, it sort of feels like a therapy of some sort."
176053932,"From Wikipedia: This suggests that regional brain abnormalities linked to inappropriate affect, have a genetic foundation."
176053933,"You are lucky then. Medication took away the positives but left me with the negatives. So, I am a lazy sloth-ball of fat. I work but not too hard. Life is ok. I hope that your medication continues to work. My medication works but leaves me lethargic. I have a ravenous appetite too. So, I’m a eating machine that sleeps mostly. When I’m awake, I work- not much. I want to feel normal too. But, these days I wonder what is normal? You must feel wonderful that you are feeling well. My heart goes out to you. I wish you the very best!"
176053934,"_PERSON_ it is hard to know, maybe it is no one’s fault. Maybe it just is because like _AT_MENTION_ says, shiit is bound to happen, given enough time. Mistakes is part of learning. It is just such a tough statement to take in though, cos some peoples mistakes or them being at the receiving end of mistakes, seems to be for life. I find it hard to understand how life is so seemingly unfair."
176053935,Some of my “Unusual Beliefs” Aka Delusions are frankly too personal too share. I make notes on mine - but alot of it is for personal advancement only.
176053936,"I guess so, the evidence from vaping there so few deaths from vaping than cigarettes is amazing, and there trying ban vaping. Cigarettes KILLS millions of people a year i did research. Look up online youll see the truth vaping is not that dangerous."
176053937,So you dont feel groggy when u sleep less then that?
176053938,My psychiatrist suggested the liquid form. But I don’t like it. I will ask the pharmacist for pills
176053939,Thank you for welcoming me
176053940,"_AT_MENTION_ I recommend working on your coping skills. That’s what I did first. She’ll try to get to know you, but you may want to make a list. Is she doing CBT? Good luck, bro!"
176053941,"Be honest. Apologize. And pay it back as soon as you can. If it she needs the money now maybe you can sell some old books or something you don’t need. Straining or losing the relationship (if it’s a good one) isn’t worth the $20. As for the smoking, check online for studies for smokers. A lot of colleges and hospitals need participants for real life research and will pay the people who volunteer. Sometimes you get free treatment for the nicotine addiction. Other times they just pay you for your time. Either it’s a good way to get your foot in the door if you’d like to quit. Be sure to look for these studies on trustworthy sites like the hospital or college site, instead of say craigslist."
176053942,i was the assistant platoon leader in bootcamp. it was extremely hard for me. i wasn’t very good because of my shyness and anxiety.
176053943,"I can lose a few pounds, that might be nice even. But. Many days im not hungry at all lately. Today i had one piece of bread with feta and softdrink, at lunch. Thats it. No breakfast. No dinner. No snacks. Nothing. Im not ill. I often skip breakfast and dinner. Or have something tiny. Before i used to a lot more. Any thoughts on why this might have changed? I cant remember the last proper meal really."
176053944,Just heard on the news 18 doctors died from corona in Italy. Its sad that they get infected while treating corona. They are burning the corpses to avoid contamination.
176053945,"Trust me, I know how you feel. After yesterday’s effort I feel flat today too."
176053946,"Just tell them you want to discuss it with a psychiatric doctor. Do you not have one anyway for BPD? Cant you discuss it with them, the crisis team are only there for support really, if you want to get a diagnosis you should try to be getting seen by a pdoc."
176053947,Em#3: chooses cocaine over food
174355623,"i had some brain scans. lots of white matter damage. but other than that i think it waxes and wanes like mood swings for me. sometimes, i am smart and other times dumb. it definitely feels like brain damage although i don’t know if permanent. i lost a lot of intelligence over the years. im more concerned with motivation than iq right now. no point in having a Ferrari or lambo when it cant even start or get out of the drive way!"

176053949,Im at 190. Before APs i was about 130. And that was almost 3 years ago. My brother works construction and weights 149. I would like to weigh similar to him.
176053950,First of all bring it up to your psychiatrist. It could be a side effect of the clozapine.
176053951,normal eeverferfre
176053952,It’s nice you appreciated her for that. When other nurses here about this sort of stuff or see it being done they would do better.
176053953,Maybe call a doctor and make an appointment to see him especially for you.
176053954,"I haven’t been too god at taking my Vitamin D recently. But I have been good at eating healthier portions of food. I feel good about my weight. Some might say I still weight too much, but this is a comfortable level for me, and the weight has been stable for months."
176053955,"Prescribe health supplements for a better brain, to increase brain activity Happiness is a state of existence."
176053956,I have heard that alcohol negates our medication by raising dopamine. Has anyone here tried a glass of wine in the evening or a vodka cola and what were the effects?
176053957,"The key is to get on the lowest dose of antipsychotic you can that works for you. Before I got on a small dose I was pacing in circles from akathisia. Going down from 20mg to 15 didn’t help, 15 to 10 didn’t either, but going from 10mg to 7.5mg finally eliminated it, now I can sit and lay down for as long as I like."
176053958,I also like vaping because its much cheaper than smoking.
176053959,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ ! 've already posted but I’ll tag _AT_MENTION_ because I think that’s what you meant to do !

176053962,"Congrats, keep it up. I quit all substances years ago (cigs/weed/shrooms/alcohol) and started eating healthy, exercising and using CBT to improve my thinking and psychology."
176053963,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Thank you for your responses. I was going to type a huge response but I’m in extreme fatigue and pain unfortunately, so please bear with me. I’ll get back to this thread soon apologies!"
176053964,"I think most sz try to express themselves through some sort of art form. Some write poems, others draw or paint, others may compose etc. There is a common denominator. Grief. We have all lost a lot to this illness. Those who happen to have a sense of humor are more well equipped but it’s still not an easy battle. We all need support."
176053965,Ohhh grate!!! Funny. I can relate!
176053966,"The first two weeks on anti psychotics I felt like I was about to jump out of my skin, extremely restless. I thought my soul was trying to get out, nobody told me it was a side effect, if I had known I would have resisted. I didn’t even know the meds I took were called anti psychotics until I’d been sick five years. I took melleril, a major tranquilizer, now off the market. I would have disliked taking a med with the word psycho in it, but nobody I’ve ever known had that problem."
176053967,i hope u get to see a pdoc soon who can give a good diagnosis. i personally am too uninformed to give u any advice. take care.

176053973,"I take 100mg of gabapentin in the AM. Too much makes me manic, but 100 is just enough for me. I also take 100-300 mg PRN if I have a panic attack. I like it because it takes away the panic without making me feel high. As an added bonus, it strongly increased my libido."
174355624,that is good news I’m happy for you!
176053974,I feel like you’re stuck in somewhere between completely delusional and not delusional. You know that its a delusion but you still partially believe in it while having doubts about it. There’s other users here like you too. Is it worse for you without meds? Like do you fully believe in your delusion without doubts?
176053975,Great. Some people don’t dream at all.
176053976,_AT_MENTION_ what if you took some acting classes? Might be fun. I thought about doing it too. No bull.
176053977,I see. Then you just have to cope in a far from ideal situation. Just try getting by provoking your brother as little as possible. Remind yourself that things could be a lot worse. Like think of what people locked up in prison have to deal with. Getting locked up in a american prison looks like a nightmare to me. Not like the cozy prisons in my country where you get your own room with a computer with wifi and tv. I think some people get locked up on purpose here because they have a better and more controlled life in prison.
176053978,"Yes, I am underage"
176053979,"I could make my voices scream angrily or panicky with the vacuumcleaner trick I discovered. When hallucinating, turn on the vacuumcleaner and put your fingers in the hose, play around a bit so you can pitch the white noise from the machine. My voices would adjust their tone of voice accordingly. Gave me a sense of control over them which helped coping. I would attribute a great deal of power and authority to them, with this, I got some back for myself."
176053980,"God knows I am no authority on it. I’m just parroting someone who I took to be an authority on it. Even when people have the same dx, there is no cookie cutter uniformity to the progression of their mental disease. Whatever you believe about your own case is probably the truth."

176053984,He does allow me to use social media. He and I both chose not to use it when the government decided they can look at your social media to help determine if you’re disabled or not. We don’t want the government reading about our lives.
176053985,I don’t laugh as much as I used to. My Depression has reared its ugly head again at the moment so I really don’t find anything funny.
176053986,That’s what I was going to say. The bottom line is whether or not this guy is worth it. It’s a tough decision only you can make.

I had researched schizophrenia in the past but the symptoms apparently had not progressed far enough to make me take a second look. However, it now seems quite apparent that both I and likely my dad have schizophrenia unbeknownst to us until now. Again, I’m not certain of anything but I would like to at least be armed with more knowledge than what I have now-especially in the realm of what people typically experience with the illness (broad is totally fine, I don’t want to encroach on anyone’s privacy). I would also really appreciate help with what the first steps would potentially be, aside from the obviously needed psychologist and psychiatrist appointments. Thank you so much for reading this

I think people flag more because they are personally insulted than because the offender is actually breaking forum rules. I’ve had disagreements with posters but I know when I am reacting because of my feelings. There are people I just don’t get along with personally, but I stay away from them so it doesn’t become personal. To be honest I do react when posters joke about women, that come across as sexist, but that’s just my opinion. I think people have less of a filtering system because we know we’ll never meet each other in the real world and also we are free to change identities. No offense, but some of you I would not hang out with in real life but others I probably would. I just think we could all try to put personal feelings aside and understand that even though we might not get along we are all equal. tiptoes away"

There are always going to be bad things that come along which we can’t control, but we CAN control how we deal with those things. The serenity prayer from AA is actually quite helpful in this situation. They say “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference.” :^)"

It’s as if I’ve hit menopause but I’m only 27 years old. It’s really sad to me that I can’t have a sexual relationship with my husband anymore. I would stop Invega _PERSON_, but it keeps me mostly sane and functional; I need it. Do any of you who suffer with sexual dysfunction have treatments that help or reverse this side effect? I’ve tried h*rny goat weed and that didn’t help. My doctor tried to prescribe Addyi (the “female Viagra”) but my insurance refuses to cover it. Any advice? I’m really sad.

So I’ve taken 300mg amisulpride for two weeks, then 200mg for nearly two weeks. I see her again on Tuesday when she will do another blood test to see if the lower dose lowered my prolactin or not. I’m scared, because I have sensed Alien again this last week. When I was well, I started to doubt if he existed anymore, but now I know he does. I sense this dark aggressive energy again. Not from me though but from him. Not voices at moment, but this regular inserted thoughts of violence and I’m scared Alien will use me to kill.

You do realize that we are few and far between, right? Like it or not, the great majority of people will never develop a chronic mental illness, and of the ones that do, most are afflicted with anxiety disorders and depression. Weed helps a lot of people, and really, I think it’s unnecessary to ban it just because it might trigger schizophrenia in, at the very most, 1% of people. And again, that’s at the very most, because many of us started showing symptoms as children, long before we even had the means to get drugs."

Connection is so important and it’s horrifying that people in this world still haven’t figured this out. It’s ??????? mind boggling to me how few people get this.

174355693,"Idk for 50 years it has been played as the mother of all mental illnesses and mass murderers and every thing else but the kitchen sink. Hollywood has made trillions on it Maybe if they change the name they will all get confused lmao But All jokes aside there’s not a good name for any mental illness after Hollywood gets done with. I remember well when bipolar was manic depression, Even _NAME_ got on that band wagon with his hit called “manic depression” I don’t think in my lifetime I will see mental illness to have the right perspective of what it actually is no matter what the diagnosis is I hear constantly that it’s the cancer of all mental illness so I guess that makes sociopaths and pychopaths a common cold. I guess in the end it doesn’t matter what they call it the _USER_ID_ is the same."
176054246,"Ok that’s reassuring. Thanks _AT_MENTION_ He did say something about follow up, but I only remember now you mention it."
176054247,I wish I was healthy

176054249,"I am on clonazepam 0.5 mg , it does affect cognition to some extent you can consult your pdoc about this."
176054250,My mood is low. I get brain fog. I dont want to do anything. Been listening to music…helps sometimes. I barely watch tv. I want to be calm. my meds… Zyprexa Cipralex Mirtazapine Melatonin Atarax Not seeing my pdoc until fall. These meds are horryfying.
174355702,"There’s lawsuits out there you can probably join. I did a class action once. It was annoying because if you are a representive they put your name and location online and in newspapers. I was even mentioned on tv. I had a lot of stress from it and the damned people at the hospital psych ward thought I was hallucinating it, but I wasn’t. I even showed them the online stuff and they were oike OH! But yeah, the inserts list addiction as a side effect and so does the website. So I don’t know how any lawsuit will go since they disclose the possibility."
176054251,I might sound rude here but it might be nice to keep personal details like this between your family instead of ranting about it. Your grandpa lives on in spirit. And yeah what _NAME_ said respect your parents cuz you may never know when they will pass too
176054252,The social worker wants to see me but my father feels that I should be seeing a psychologist. Maybe he’s right. Chances are that a social worker would have no or very little experience dealing with psychosis.

176054258,How’d you get it for free?
174355694,"I don’t know what is worse, a severe mental illness like schizophrenia or gaining a lot weight on these terrible meds at a very young age. I had my first episode at 21 years old, I am still living with the aftermath and the constant symptoms. Lots of guys are interested in me but for what purpose? I wanna be at peace, that’s the only thing I want from life."
176054259,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . Lately, I just leave and take a drive and go to the store or a drive thru fast food joint and sit in the parking lot with my laptop or phone."

176054270,I cleaned the house this morning. And had a shower. I’m waiting on a book to arrive from amazon so I can read that. Hopefully I will go out with the dog too but it will have to be somewhere where there is shade cause it’s quite hot.
174355704,"They say Olanzapine is better than Abilify for negative symptoms but that’s not true for me and my psychiatrist said Abilify is the only med that might work for negative symptoms. I tried Abilify, Olanzapine, Risperdal, Latuda and Wellbutrin. Only Abilify helped my negative symptoms. Pretty sure that these results are not universal as every med works differenty for everyone, especially for negative symptoms."

176054288,"I asked my psychiatrist and psych nurse when if lumateperone would be available for uk patients, if it gets approval in September. He had not heard of the drug or its trials.

176054292,oh yeah? Did you figure out what it means…through a translator or something?
176054293,Power walks. I walk really fast =D I should also say to anyone else that is fatigued you should use a medication called Modafinil. Modafinil is a energy booster used for people who work night shift. Its actually really amazing. I used it to stay awake long hours working out and i lost 70 pounds doing that.

176054297,"Life is pretty meaningless and I am not under the assumption that I am in a simulation. The majority of people work in pretty meaningless jobs, carrying out mundane existences from cradle to the grave. Perhaps they find meaning in having offspring or helping another person but life on this planet working for money with imagined substance and value seems to be what it is all about for most. Once food to eat, shelter, sex i.e… basic _PERSON_ needs are met what is the purpose of life even for those that don’t believe this is all a simulation? Perhaps a quest for meaning is our task. All the religions preach it believing they have the answer. Philosophers contemplate it. Others tried to escape it hedonistically. What does it matter at the end of the day? Meet your daily requirements, and do what makes you happy as long as it harms no one else. Take a cold shower to feel how real the world can be! Fall in love and be emotionally real! If you can’t function without meds then perhaps it is a no brai
ner. If you can then make sure you are clean and respectable and don’t take the drugs which can ultimately shorten life and cognitively impair you. Or meet in the middle and function on a minimum dose of meds and see how it makes you feel."

176054309,How long have you been on it _AT_MENTION_ ? Have you seen improvement in your ocd?
176054310,One day at a time. It’s a cliche because it’s true. Congrats on 6 years sober. Whatever you are doing to keep sober keep doing it because it’s working. A huge part of my recovery is not hanging around people who drink or do drugs or hanging around places where there’s alcohol and drugs being used. Good luck on having continuous sobriety. .
176054311,Very little. I need to get back crocheting.

But I’m also having nose surgery next month, so I don’t know how long I have to rest until I can start going to the gym again"
176054385,"Enlightenment is tricky. First, I keep in mind that it’s a human idea. I think where we all go wrong is that we try and “be” enlightened, while in reality (at least in my view), it’s likely more natural to just let it be what it is. It’s not a spiritual contest where people win ribbons for being more enlightened than one another, and in fact, that goes against the concept of harmony, equality, and unity on many levels. Religion bothers me when I let it muddle around in my head, and for me I just keep things simple - be loving towards others. I have a religious belief, but I keep it private. Take a look throughout history and look at the correlation between war, death, and extreme religion. Trying to just give my view on it. For all I know maybe you are super enlightened beyond the rest of us. Even so, I love my life with my measly unenlightenment and simple things."

I am in a position right now where i have nothing left to loose, so if she gives me permission, i will receive the treatment."
176054393,It can be hit or miss but if I listened to every bad story about my medications I wouldn’t have improved to lead a good life…Like I always heard zyprexa was bad and mad you add weight. I have lost more on it than risperdal or abilify the other ones I’ve tried… Talk to your doctor. A good shrink will have a feel to you and your symptoms and it’s worth a shot…Your brain won’t die that’s for sure. It’ll change some neural pathways but that isn’t a bad thing for those with sz…In my opinion.

174355727,"I’d imagine if I got a DID therapy specialist it would get me on the right track and get me through the right doors instead of wasting time with “traditional” therapy. Not sure what else to do. I know I’m on my own and I appreciate this forum for letting me speak and say what’s largely on my mind without holding back. I’ve been reading stuff on the Illuminati and Monarch (non-detectable slave) and how this could have happened to me as an adult and how it is still affecting me now. I’m just trying to recover. It’s interesting how the “plants” are put into the hospital setting which is very unsettling whether _USER_ID_ or deliberate. I don’t know. Must cost a lot of money, resources, and man power. Seems counter productive and counter intuitive. I must be a very, very important person. The books I read are literally disgusting even to me. I have to read a bit and then take a day or two off (breaks) and go back. I obviously cannot discuss the material here even though I find the 
material therapeutic generally. Knowledge is power I have learned. My mom and most people are just normal folks. They cannot handle this nasty stuff that goes on in the world – whether it is real or not or even some of it. I think some of it does go on and it’s being exposed. Hence the climatic stuff happening as a result in our society. I think society is changing for the better but it won’t be going back to what it was like. We are facing a change a real change that is tearing at the fabric of our fallen society and civilization. From what I read, DID is caused in childhood. I had a normal childhood as far back as I remember and recall. It all started in 2010/2011 at college for me in this life/timeline although this isn’t my first life (I think this is real). I keep coming back alive like groundhog day haha but it’s not funny. It’s horrible for me and sick and sad. So I’m thinking I got artificial DID or artificial, improperally diagnosed schizophrenia. That and it feels political like what t
hey did in the Soviet Union. It’s not the government’s fault. It’s the medical community, society, media, and doctors, and industry. It’s our history and our society’s qualms since the holocuast. I guess you can say our government (and Illuminati fronts such as the CIA) has been expanding on the Nazi’s research since WW2 and still go about the experiments… I really don’t know or sometimes want to know. I don’t think my mind can stomach and swallow it. For instance, in college, I saw a white light and went to a parallel universe or white portal. Now, reading one of my books, it says this is done from high voltage DC current through MK-Ultra Monarch electro-shock, which I remember. I sound nuts, but this is my point of view and experience(s) in life and story. It sounds like schizophrenia! Especially the different dimensions part, which just makes my story unbelievable to the average person. I don’t know and understand why it’s labeled under “National Security” (From what I’ve read) 
because it doesn’t do ????. It just protects the perpetrators and psychopaths doing it so I cannot remember and I cannot bring about a logical, valid story. It seems like everyone is in on it: the government, therapists, school, patients, parents, students, and family. It’s sad and crazy… I also was thinking about paying someone (somebody) some money online for some deprogramming or some past life regression/regression/hypnotic regression. Someone cheap who maybe knows about this stuff and has been around this stuff. I found an author whom I bought a book from. I’m sure I could afford a few sessions. Hell, I’m only 31. Maybe by the time I’m 37 or 40 years old, I can write some reams of books or volumes of books on my knowledge and theories and stories of not just what happened to me but so I can afford to take care of myself and make a living for myself instead of being a total complete slave to these people. Usually Monach Slaves don’t make it past 30 years old. That’s when they self-destruct 
or “disappear”. I’m 31 years old now. Just turned 31. It feels like it’s the first time in over 10,000 lives that I made it this far. It’s like I did something right in this life to make it this long in my recovery. Nobody should ever have control on somebody’s life like this. Nobody should be a slave. Perpretrators should not only be caught but should be in prison to say the least. It’s systemic and a cancer to the whole country and planet. I don’t blame my mom (in fact I feel bad and am angry at what people did to her son (me)), but she is very very evangelical to the point where she quotes scripture and tells me to avoid all this stuff and read the bible. It feels like she’s programmed too! Like my front alter is a Christian Republican. I used to be a Libertarian Atheist. I don’t know. It just seems all to real and all to traumatizing like even aliens were involved. Thank you!"

174355737,"As a rule of thumb, I would not advise someone with SZ/SZA use any drugs your doctor doesn’t prescribe. It can make your symptoms much worse, and generally isn’t worth the risk That being said, I’ve found that the drugs, all drugs, effect people differently. Chances are they will have an expected result, but every so often the drug doesn’t work as intended. Weed helped relax me, helped my anxiety. But I think I’m an unusual case. And I know the weed use didn’t give me my brain thing, I was sick ever before I used drugs.

People don’t know what you do or don’t have limiting you but they will judge you for not working just the same. Maybe that’s why so many resort to lieing there azzes off. What really gets me is people who apparently have had near ideal circumstances with the disease but judge others without their advantages. I have literally had a guy that worked as a guardian criticize me because I only worked for four months, three full time but couldn’t get a permanent job. I couldn’t even use my time at Goodwill as a work reference. It’s hard for me to believe anyone doesn’t see the discrimination, or thinks we get half a fair shake.

I never told anyone or showed my symptoms besides skin picking and hair pulling. I was pretty social for having autism but i was unaware until i was a teen that people never actually liked me until they told me. Which happened so much. I was always accused of being annoying. My schizoaffective is worse and im getting more and more episodes despite being on meds. I have a psychotic break every 4ish months and usually i get really suicidal but not always.

Although sex differences have been identified in schizophrenia, sex differences in sleep patterns among patients with schizophrenia are not established. Therefore, the current study examined sex differences in subjective sleep quality patterns in people with schizophrenia utilizing a standardized inventory. Participants: Study sample consisted of 75 patients with schizophrenia and 82 healthy controls (HC). Methods: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Compared to HC, patients with schizophrenia were more likely to report being poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5), longer sleep duration, more sleep disturbances, longer sleep onset latency, increased daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, a
nd more frequent use of sleep medications. Regarding sex differences, female patients were more likely to report being poor sleepers and endorsed more sleep disturbances than female HC, while male patients reported longer sleep duration, more daytime dysfunction, and poorer overall sleep quality relative to male HC. Additionally, higher level of sleep dysfunction was linked to higher symptom severity in male patients only. Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia endorsed a range of sleep difficulties, and male and female patients with schizophrenia differ compared to their HC counterparts. Implications for treatment of sleep complaints among patients with schizophrenia are discussed."

176054500,Yes thats what I was thinking about and what I had before my diagnosis. Sadly here we can’t see a psychiatrist without a referral from a gp so all 3 gp I have seen said its stress and one thought I had psychological problems not psychiatric so he sent me to a psychologist.

If we are going to play doctors we might as well know the facts. Incidentally, I’ve had very negative, but also very positive experiences with psychologists. In fact it was a psychologist who picked up the signs that I might be suffering from a sz spectrum disorder. Psychiatrists on the other hand usually just run through the checklist and don’t take the time to listen to you. But I know, the forum fully encourages people to accept psychiatrists’ authority even if it means years of changing diagnosis (which we have been trained to accept as ‘normal’) and med combos until striking lucky. Good psychiatrists however see psychologists in a more positive and nuanced light. They are complementary rather than ‘opposed’ as suggested by some."

This whole mess started when my voices told me that there was a battle between good and evil and that I had a mission from God. 4 had names, but they seemed to be more of a collective consciousness as opposed to individual entities. I used to frequent an OCD forum where people kept asking me if I was hallucinating (turns out I was), but this episode was the final straw. They said I was schizophrenic and that they couldn’t help me, and I guess at some point I looked up the right words to find this forum. I don’t quite remember how I found it."

174355755,"I first want to say good day to you all and thank you for providing a support forum for us sufferers of mental illness. I suffer from severe OCD, to be more specific I suffer from “OCD with psychotic features.” To deal with OCD we’re often told to just ignore it and walk away. But as you all know, with all mental illnesses there are just some symptoms that are not that easy to just walk away from. And today I want to talk about those. Today I want to talk about the more stranger symptoms of OCD and mental illnesses that are alot tougher to simply ignore and walk away from, and those symptoms are: “strange anomalistic experiences.” Being an OCD sufferer for 20 plus years these stranger symptoms have been the hardest to deal with for the last 7 years or so that I have exeprienced them, and have brought me to the point of contemplating suicide because of the difficulty they make for rational thinking. Below is the original post that I posted to other forums regarding these experiences and I 
look forward to hearing your various opinions on how to best tackle these strange experiences. Thanks. ""As many of you may already know, many people with ocd and other mental illnesses suffer from strange and debilitating anomalistic experiences like strange coincidences and synchronicities that we can’t explain. (Normal people deal with them too, but they’re more severe in mental illness sufferers) The experiences of these events feel telepathic and psychic like, or like we’re manifesting it with our thoughts. For us with illnesses like OCD, they scare us and cause depression, distress, and anger. Many of us are fighting to be skeptic and rational thinkers when it comes to things like the paranormal, but these experiences keep happening and they’re driving us insane. What we go through is what psychologists call magical thinking, and we want to accept that and move on, but our experiences are so strange and debilitating that instead of moving on, our ocd progresses into a form of ocd called “ocd w
ith psychotic features or ocd with poor insight” Our ocd is so bad that we’re on the same level in suffering as schizophrenics. I know this is true because of my own suffering and reading about the severe suffering of other OCD sufferers. During my research I found out that schizotypal and schizophrenia sufferers also go through these synchronistic/psychic like experiences. And many theories have been brought forth like too much dopamine causing overactive pattern recognition, among other explanations. But the experiences happen so much and feel so real that the explanations don’t add up and im left in severe mental pain. Here’s a link to the theory that dopamine causes overactive pattern recognition in mental illnesses like schizophrenia: https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/from-realworld-events-to-psychosis(699417f3-841e-4b2c-aa62-79fef843c3d5)/export.html After searching and searching for more rational explanations, I realized that with these type of things it will be impossible to fin
d a definite answer to. So after awhile I realized that the best thing that could help me was by finding a place of like minded people who also go through these things as well so we can share similar experiences and find peace. Before this forum my favorite ocd forum was “stuck in a door” (which is nolonger working) because it had many posts of people going through these experiences. And it really helped me out alot and helped me stay strong without worrying about finding an answer. I’m creating this thread so that people who suffer from these experiences can have a place to to find relief by reading other people’s experiences and to share their own experiences to help others. I feel like this is one of the most debilitating things an ocd or any mentally ill person can go through. I say that because so many cultures around the world accept the things we go through as already true without trying to find other natural explanations first. But many of us mentally ill people (despite our experiences) are f
ighting to be rational, critical thinkers and scientific minded, but because of so many people who believe in this stuff without investigation, it makes it painful for us, because it’s hard to find rational dialogue about our experiences. Many of us want to find a place where others share our experiences and a place where scientific minded people will try to give rational explanations to what we go through. For many ocd issues the common advice is: accept it and walk away. But there are certain things that are just too difficult to accept and walk away. To walk away from some things, first we need to know we’re not along to give us strength. And this is one of those things. And I hope this thread can be that place for those of us who are contemplating suicide because of these experiences. Personally I suffer from many strange anomalistic synchronicity or psychic experiences. I will explain one of them below. Alot of times I feel horrible and like the only way out is suicide. So I look forward to reading o
ther comments regarding these experiences to give me some type of peace. Here’s one of my regular experiences: A scary intrusive thought hits me, and then my mind suddenly thinks that the random world “_NAME_” will be said to confirm that it’s true. For some strange reason I can sense _NAME_ being said. It’s like the word _NAME_ will be a sign of confirmation. Then in a split second the word _NAME_ is actually said and I freak out and panic, because these strange things are not supposed to happen. This happens to me multiple times a day. And it’s not just words, it other specific sounds and events. I fight to be rational but It gets so bad that I feel that something supernatural is causing it to happen to destroy my life. And I have to immediately go to google to search for rational answers to get my rationality back. It all happens in either a split second, or a 5 second window. First the intrusive thought then the intrusive thought of a sudden word or sound or the thought of something else happe
ning to confirm it as a sign happens right after thinking it. Then the things I saw as a sign actually happens. It never fails. Sometimes these signs will seem to be caused by my next action, for example: sometimes there is a strong intrusive thought of something bad or good happening and then a feeling that if I turn left or right to pick up something for example, then the specific noise will happen that will confirm the good or bad thought as true. Sometimes the noises feel like they’re just waiting for your next action to synchronize it with the sound you’re thinking of, so that the universe can show you that it all is real, and that it’s goal is to hurt you. It feels as if you’re manifesting it into reality. Here’s an interesting example story: When me and my ex girlfriend were together we we’re texting back and forth while she was at work. (We met online, she lived overseas, and we had never met in person) Suddenly while we’re texting, she stops because she gets too busy at work. During thi
s time I take a break myself and I go in the kitchen to get something to eat. So I can take a break with her. I left my phone on the bed. I leave for 2 or 3 hours. While I’m gone, it hits me that she’s obviously gonna text me back before I get back into the room giving that I will be gone for so long. The longer I stay gone I start to hope that she has already texted me back. But then a scary ocd intrusive thought hits and says that she hasn’t texted me back yet, but that she will do it as soon as I get back settled into my room, and that that will prove that we’re all connected or something or that there’s a psychic or law of attraction type thing happening with all of us and it will prove that a supernatural force is controlling everything. After this intrusive thought I’m hoping that she has already texted me to prove this ocd type thought wrong. But unfortunately when I get back into the room everything happened as I thought it. But with a horrible _USER_ID_: I entered my room. My phone was si
tting on my bed on the charger. At this point I didn’t know if I got a text from her or not. I was afraid to check it because I had a strong feeling that OCD was right and that she hadn’t yet texted me back. A minute had gone by without me checking and I was really anxious. I think I then checked it and confirmed that there was no text and found myself even more anxious because the OCD thought was beginning to manifest. While severely anxious I put my phone down on my bed, and opened my dresser in my room and then while looking through my dresser this strong intrusive thought and feeling hits me that my girlfriend is gonna die and that when I turn left to reach for the item i was looking for, she will text me in that exact moment to confirm that it’s true. And I pause for a moment in fear, and panic, and anger, and then after waiting for a good minute I try to challenge the OCD by angerly turning left and getting the item, and just like the OCD told me, she texted me! How in the hell does this stuff hap
pen!? Right on cue as if it was destined! The whole time deep down inside from the moment the intrusive thought hit me while I was in the kitchen, I felt like the thought was correct, and that she wasn’t gonna text me until I got into my room and settled in for at least 3-5 minutes. Those moments happen alot faster and more consistant than the example above, but I just thought that was an important story to show the other ways it can manifest. As I mentioned briefly before that story, it also happens with good positive thoughts. For example: You have a good positive thought about something in your life and then the OCD instrusively says that you’re gonna hear something that’s gonna confirm it as true, and that it will mean that something supernatural exists. And just as OCD predicted, the sound that it intrusively put into your mind is actually heard seconds later and in that moment you feel that that positive thought is tainted because you don’t won’t to believe something supernatural is controllin
g everything. It happens so often that It feels like a evil force is doing this to mess with you so you can’t enjoy anything in life. It hits you so hard that you just break down and cry sometimes. It causes fits of rage and anger because you know this shouldn’t be happening this often. It’s not just with sounds in the environment and words from people. But it’s also with numbers on clocks and any other thing you can imagine. But it’s just more constant with words and sounds from people and inanimate objects. I.e. telphone ringing, car horns, heating and air conditioning coming on and going off and radios and TV’s. Etc. I tried to find rational explanations for these things like the subconscious, intuition, confirmation bias, or just having psychotic breaks from the severe OCD. And in the past I started to feel better with these explanations, but then I realized that it was happening so much that non of the explanations added up anymore, and i realized it’s not delusion, or any other explanation
, but that it was actually happening. I also noticed that there are many moments when I’m close to rationalizing one strange synchronicity, and accepting that it’s not real and just my mind, but just when I get close to having that peace that it’s all fake, the exact next thing I’m thinking in that moment instantly happens as if to slap me in the face to say I’m real. And in those moments it hurts so bad, it feels like the only way out is suicide. A long time ago I read on another ocd forum someone explaining this experience as “automatic coincidence” And that’s the perfect explanation, it feels automatic as if the synchronicity was destined to happen in the sequence. Or like you’re manifesting it into reality. If there is a rational explanation then the only one at this point would be the one by psychologist _NAME_ Surprise who says that we control 3 to 6 percent of our environment and the other one being quantum entanglement which says that our minds are naturally connected through quatum 
mechanics. Here’s two YouTube videos of _NAME_ Surprise explaining his theory of synchronicity: (Part 1): https://youtu.be/gwBluKDTnl0 (Part 2): https://youtu.be/9T-PRlmoIFY Here’s a rational perspective on quantum entanglement and psychic experiences: YourTango – 27 Feb 18 If You Know Things Before They Happen, You Have This Magical Brain Quirk How does science explain your magic? And here’s a link to a scientific study that says that we unconsciously react to events up to 10 seconds before they happen. And it’s called “Predictive Anticipatory Activity” The Daily Grail – 4 _USER_ID_ Scientific Research Suggests We Unconsciously React to Events Up to 10... Can your brain detect events before they even occur? That was the stunning conclusion of a 2012 _NAME_-analysis of experiments from seven independent laboratories over the last 35 years, which found that the human body “can apparently detect randomly... Many people experience these type of things with _NAME_, but I don’t experience it th
at way, (or at least not that often) I just usually get a strong intrusive psychic sense of a word or sound from someone that I didn’t choose to think of, and someone says it a second or 5 seconds later. With these experiences I’ve been on the verge of suicide and getting closer and closer everyday because of the severe mental pain they cause. The only reason I’m still alive is because of well known paranormal skeptics that I look up to like _NAME_, _NAME_, _NAME_ Surprise, and _NAME_ among many others. (_NAME_ rational explanation for synchronicity/Psychic experiences): (One of _NAME_ discussions about the existence of the paranormal): In an effort to better understand these experiences and provoke rational discussion I will also like to add that people who do drugs like weed and psychedelics also experience these type of things often. So is there a correlation with a brain suffering from mental illness and a brain that’s high on drugs? From my research on drug users who have these experiences, my ve
rdict is that there is and I suggest that we study these people. What ever is in those drugs that’s causing their brains to experience these things must be the same thing that’s in the brain of a person with a mental illness. Here’s one of those posts by a drug user experiening this. It’s from a marijuana support forum: https://forum.grasscity.com/threads/telepathy-psychic-abilities-whilst-stoned-d.283254/ Ironically after I calm down from these OCD/synchronicity attacks and I see a little rationality, I find myself facinated by all these experiences, because I wonder how is it possible for a simple brain to do all of these things! If anybody else sufferers from these things please share and give me some type of peace that other people are in this fight with me. My goal with this post is to find rational people who are also dealing with these experiences, so we can look at the rational explanations I provided, and have rational discussions regarding what most likely is happening here so we can promote 
a more peaceful mind in sufferers. I’m mainly looking for skeptics who went through this before but who over came it and remained skeptics. I look forward to hearing from many of you. IF THIS POST WAS TOO LONG TOO READ THEN HERES THE SHORT SUMMARY: I’m Debilitated and sometimes suicidal because of anomalistic experiences like synchronicity and psychic phenomenon and looking for support, and a rational discussion based off the scientific sources I provided. I’m mainly looking for skeptics who went through this before but who over came it and remained skeptics to give me strength to overcome it myself. I will like to add that although my rational side has been weakend by my illness, I’m still a rational thinker at heart, so I expect rational discussion here based on the sources I provided, thanks"""

If its Rexulti it has the same side effects as Abilify my psy said once, its a very similar drug. Find out if they’re lying. Are you having any side effects now? I would personally sue them and get money from them but I am not smart enough now. As for stopping weed, if you can’t simply stop it, try vaping nicotine (if you can’t without nicotine) or without nicotine. Vaping nicotine salts 40mg made me stop weed, drinking, cigars, shisha and cigarettes. I hope you will feel better!"

176054555,"From our views,we have an important comments on the issue of a person’s resistance to the first medical intervention There are many actual reasons behind this issue that have not been mentioned in most scientific reports that have been written on this subject For example 1- after the occurrence of sz,the first dose of medical intervention should be aimed at bringing the person into a state of deep sleep,that is in order to make him leave the wakefulness world with all its mental events responses that increase numerically and qualitatively with the passage of time,which it is increases the level of attention factor and drains the neural energy,which never reach the point of complete cessation all time of wakefulness ,add for that an insufficient number of reverse chemical processes that get rid of the metabolism of the aforementioned processes During sleep,the metabolism products of these extreme processes are completely eliminated,and the state of balance returns to its usual state after awakenin
g from sleep,as the effect of the sz’s pathogen (H) begins again from scratch !! We know,there is no specific medicine capable of suppressing the mental events responses,the dynamic imagination or the malicious feelings that is constantly generated by action of hallucination in the conscious mind of the person (in any period time of wakefulness) 2-the person’s behavior after undergoing the first treatment does is the most important factor in the voluntary response to the effect of the drug -what should he do and not do after receiving the first treatment dose ? Some of what he does is resistance the effectiveness of the drug !"

Quitting stimulants (such as methylphenidate) I get a bit more tired for a day or two, but that’s all. With antipsychotics, I get no immediate adverse reactions from cessation, but it may be that in the longer term these drugs prevent mania. With time, I’ve come more and more to the insight that it is important to avoid mania, because although it feels great(! I mean it!), it doesn’t end well, and it’s not worth the price you have to pay for it, such as, notably, hospitalisation, getting delusions, wasting money, sometimes even outright destructive behavour such as vandalising my apartment, and other impulsive and stupid things.

In the event that a subject responds solely to SSRIs but experiences unwanted sexual side effects, bupropion may be added as an adjunctive medication. Some limited evidence also suggests that saffron may reduce some aspects of sexual dysfunction, excluding ability to reach orgasm.” Though buproprion i think is the same as wellbutrin."

I able to sit still without jitter effects of caffeine its like redirecting the caffeine in proper way.

I tried several green teas but not all give same mental and physical effects. A good green tea will give something like this feeling after drink it. A mild burning like feeling in stomach and thus crave for food probably due to better metabolism. Increased mental alertness.

176054615,That bit about ‘being someone else’ I often times get the notion that most of society around me is one selfish hive entity and gives me grief simply as I prefer to maintain my identity…like the old ‘Satan trying to get your soul’ garbage. Having said that though; there are many sheep out there who can be easily guided and sold by media. They don’t ever take quiet time out to think about things just a tad bit further. SZ is a smart man’s disease; part of the anxiety is resulting from being intelligent enough to realize that there is something amiss with the world around us. However addressing that from a mature standpoint I don’t feel that there is a malevolent design behind the situation. In example; if our world indeed a simulation then such simulations could be used as modern prisons favoring rehabilitation over punishment hence some interactions we have may feel a bit staged.

At first it was TrueHope vitamins for about a year, but they did fail a few times. Then I found Profrontal and it worked perfectly. Then at the beginning of 2018 she claimed she was cured and would no longer need anything. So from jan 2018 until the end of may 2019, she was in the hospital 11 times involuntarily. I found a doctor that recommended at homeopathic called _NAME_ Phos. 6X and said for her to take it three times per day. But she didn’t willingly take it bc she didn’t think she is sick anyway. I gave it to her bc I wanted her well and she clearly was not. The doctor said it was a possible cure, and it seemed like it would have been if she kept taking it. After a month of her being cognizant I told her what I had been doing, and she is so mad that she won’t talk to me. She wants to get better by prayer only and believ

176054662,"I have only a basic understanding of all this. But from what I can tell, there is a HUGE difference between the nerve being able to transport known hormones and neurotransmitters, and being able to transport foreign substances. The nasal passages have a very strong immune response to keep foreign substances such as germs out. That is why the researchers are starting by trying to transmit insulin and other hormones. Any foreign drug would most likely just cause an immune response and all get sneezed out."

For me these side effects were more dangerous than not being social, my credit score sucks now because I retreated lots of money from my Visa which I now cancelled. Thank god my parents paid my debt, otherwise I would be in the streets or in prison. My psychiatrist told me these are Abilify side effects that occure in some people. I was unlucky."

174355837,Well it’s a long story. I got sick in 2008 but they let me try to recover. I wasn’t immediately diagnosed with schizophrenia. They said I had adjustment disorder. I went on meds and even got cleared for full duty again and then they loaded me up with stress again with a really big project and I failed and got fired again. I was in and out of the hospital and day treatment the whole time. In 2009 they changed my diagnosis to delusional disorder but still let me try to get better. It was always schizophrenia. I was a pilot though and schizophrenia was a kiss of death so I am glad they didn’t rush to judgement. My third hospitalization in 2010 and I got the paranoid schizophrenia label. That’s when they said I didn’t meet retention standards and medical boarded me. But I was less than 2 years from retirement at that point and I applied for permanent limited duty to get to 20 years and I got approved. It was a lot of fighting. I appealed everything. I never thought I was sick. I retired in 201

Hopefully the quarantine period will last only a month…maybe two, but some form of social distancing might be required for six months. It’s probably going to be rocky for the next 2 years.

For example, I thought my wife had a separate life and was in love with another man. Whenever I thought of this, the woosh would “Confirm” that this is accurate and true.

Schizophrenia is a misunderstood condition, I’m hoping I can get a job and/or study some more and then melt into the existing structures, meaning schizophrenia doesn’t get in my way as much as it has already.

We rarely talked about heavy experiences. We sometimes told each other funny stories about it; a lot of times the stuff we told each other was not funny at the time it happened but years later it makes good war stories. I think it depends on how close you are. The people who I talked to were either friends, co-workers or roommates. Of course some of the stuff we talked about was not funny. But we talked about other things besides schizophrenia and hospitals. And a lot of the time when we were friends, we were going out to clubs or out to dinner or going to the movies etc. so we kept the conversations appropriate for the surroundings.

174355850,"# One-day tropisetron treatment improves neurocognitive function in schizophrenia Impaired neurocognitive function is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ). Sensory gating is a mechanism that filters stimuli, suppresses irrelevant stimuli and protects the integrity of cognitive function. Sensory gating deficits appear to be sensitive biomarkers of cognitive impairment in SCZ patients. Inhibition mechanisms and sensory gating are typically assessed by the conditioning-testing P50 paradigm. Agonists for ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are considered potential therapies to improve the sensory gating and cognitive deficits of SCZ patients. Tropisetron, a commonly used medicine against nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and surgical anesthesia, is also a high-affinity partial agonist of the nAChR. Previous study demonstrated that tropisetron significantly improved overall cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition defects after 10 days of treatment. However, the immediate effect of differ
ent doses of tropisetron in patients with chronic schizophrenia is unclear. Researchers from the Prof. _PERSON_ Research Group at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), conducted research on the above issues. 40 SCZ non-smokers were randomly selected into a double-blind clinical trial with four groups: placebo, 5 mg/d, 10 mg/d, and 20 mg/d of oral tropisetron. The research team measured the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and P50 inhibition before and one day after treatment. After one day of treatment, the total RBANS scores of the 20 mg and 5 mg tropisetron groups, and the immediate memory of the 10 mg group were significantly higher than placebo group. The P50 ratio was smaller in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups than in the placebo group after treatment. Furthermore, the improvement in RBANS total score was correlated with increased S1 latency, and the increase in immediate memory score was correlated with decreased S2 amplitude. One day of trea
tment with tropisetron improved both cognitive and P50 inhibition deficits, suggesting that longer term treatment with ?7 nAChR agonists for these deficits in SCZ may be promising. This work entitled “One-day tropisetron treatment improves cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition deficits in schizophrenia” was published in Neuropsychopharmacology on Apr. 29."

My sister also has no knee caps. At any rate my sister doesn’t feel sorry for herself and neither does anyone else in our family. She had surgery as a baby and has scars from surgery all up both her legs. She wears shorts in the summer and doesn’t care if somebody looks at her funny. When I think of my sister I just think of my sister. I don’t think of her disease. She’s a great cook, is passionate about her faith and is a great artist."

174355882,"Yes. My fears have always dominated me. I think they were worse when I was an adolescent, though. I’d sit in class so scared I was sure something inside would break. A lot of people have that kind of condition. In my case, when I get to the bottom of it, my fears are really a great big bore, to be so scared of nothing. So don’t feel alone. Personally, I’ve found things that make my mental illness more bearable. There have been times when I was reading a lot. I’ve read every word _PERSON_ ever wrote, at least once. I’ve read the great tragedies many times. It felt great. I live in an assisted living center for the mentally ill now, and it is the perfect place for me to write.

176054953,"IDK. I’m actually under review right now and I’m not sure exactly what I will write. I will mention my symptoms for sure. I will say my symptoms prevent me from supporting myself on my own. I will tell them about my hospitalization four years ago and how I live in supported housing. I will tell them my disability affects every aspect of my life. Of course I will tell them I’ve been on medication most of my life and will probably be on it for the rest of my life. Etc. The thing is to build a strong case and tell them all the negative stuff about the disease without being dishonest. They know from my records what I can do, they know I can work part-time, take classes, take care of myself for the most part. But I will also tell them what I can’t do which is socialize OK and have lots of friends and be happy as most other people. And the list goes on."

So ive definitely learned how to drive better. How to turn around in tough spots and a lot of stuff its all just practice. Ive always been a good driver though.

176054960,I love it! 151515
174355898,I was a straight A student. I had taken my SAT when I was fourteen so my parents picked out this nice boarding school to send me to and I completely broke down at the boarding school it was so humiliating and because I had become psychotic some of the people were teasing me. So painful. My psychosis was like I was slipping away. The first class that I lost cognitive ability for was Algebra. My teacher called my parents and said I was straight A’s and suddenly I wasn’t even completing the homework. I couldn’t focus. It was a terrible experience and If I had known I had schizophrenia before that I would have probably been ok. I believed in all sorts of religious stuff to because I’m Catholic. It is really hard to remain religious or even spiritual after you’ve had such a difficult break and not lose sight of what matters. Even though all this happened I was able to get my GED after I dropped out of HS and went off the medication. Then I managed to go to college. I’m still trying to finish.

This isn’t universal, but that is part of why I married Mr. Star. I was sick of people being so confusing all the time and never knowing the weird unwritten rules to dating. With him, there were no unwritten rules. If he wanted something, he asked for it."

I can’t stop myself from that unless the environment had a strong enough influence to stop me. that just is the way it is, it is what it is."

174355903,"Hi, I will try and keep things brief. In my 20’s I was stupid enough to be a daily user of cannabis… I seemed to enjoy watching films, anime playing video games under influence etc. Thankfully, I’ve been clean of it for 2-3 years and I’m currently 31. To date I’ve had about 6 times I’ve been admitted to a ward during an episode where I lose control. It’s normally a hypomanic manic episode with psychotic symptoms. The number of times might indicate to a lay observer that I clearly must be schizophrenic but here’s the thing… I studied Clinical Psychology and had a high aptitude for this subject. I studied cognitive biases and usually follow an empirical mindset to everything I pursue in life. In fact I strive towards reducing cognitive bias in anything I pursue in life. I question ideas of religion and have an analytical mind and question my own judgements and look towards scientific data/method and improving logical thinking daily (I value critical thinking). It’s just when I’m 
unwell, which can last for 1-2.5 months I seem to lose my rational abilities, hardly sleep and have hypomanic bouts. However, the rest of the year, I’m very scientific in my thinking and skeptical of delusional thinking which makes me think its episodic as opposed to a chronic state of being. So when I get better I cringe with embarrassment the behaviours, absurd beliefs and so forth and proceed to lead a normalish life (bar in mind I have a diagnosis of high functioning autism and Bipolar depression). When unwell It’s like being in a dream where your rational thinking is taken hostage. I usually take medication for 6 months but I dislike how antipsychotics are essentially brain atrophying (I’m looking at NAC as a second option) so the episode happens 6-8 months later. I think alcohol use might be a factor. The thing is, despite the number of times I’ve been admitted. I can’t come to terms with the impression that I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, because there are people out there who believe in 
absurd things like astrology and other magical thinking that have never been admitted and when I am well which is 9/10 of the year I’m simply not experiencing the symptoms of schizophrenia (and I’ve looked them up). The only trouble I have is with keeping jobs and working full time but that is a situational, circumstantial aspect of the penalizing reality of occupational assessments and “burning” references (by going AWOL and not turning up to work not explaining you are mentally unwell). I could very well try to be undermine or dismiss the diagnosis, but I can’t help that the initial diagnoses are done at the point of crisis and that psychiatrists seldom measure or apprehend baseline level of functioning. It gives me hope that my mental health can be recovered, and I know there is denialism among schizophrenia according to literature. I can only think that I have transient blips that are acute enough to admitted; but I’m not hearing voices or seeing hallucinations. I’m just behaving erratically 
and have manic confused thoughts. So in conclusion I don’t know if I’m a half way case… Someone who isn’t experiencing the chronic aspect but sporadic episodes of reduced mental functioning. With the right level of fitness, nutrition and wellbeing plans I could make a full recovery and not be the sum of my paperwork. I’ve never had suicidal ideation. In fact, one of my interests is life extension and living for as long as possible. Thoughts forum?"

174355896,"Humans cannot do telepathy with other humans so it is a delusion/not real. I used to converse with greys telepathically in a past life. At least a few. They are evil in my opinion. I dont want to go into too much detail. So maybe you did it in a past life or future. Maybe you read about a new tech that can do it. I have always been schizophrenic per say. I’ve met things that can read and control my mind and even send my mind through time. Junk in junk out as they say. Schizophrenia has ruined and darkened my mind. Been like this for a very long time. It’s a delusion in this reality but not necessarily all realities. I’m not more advanced, just wiser."
176054982,"That is FANTASTIC. Well done you! Thankee. The wind was gusting so hard I’m surprised any turned out as I took everything hand-held. A _NAME_ took me off the path and onto the grass beside it at one point. Thank goodness there’s still some padding on my rump, I suppose. Oof."

176054993,If I’m having a crisis I take an Ativan or Valium. The Ativan is more potent. My previous pdoc prescribed it in case of need. The Valium I got from the hospital last time I was in (Feb last year). Both take the edge off my anxiety and agitation

176055001,"The province shut down all elective surgeries for an anticipated flood of COVID patients that didn’t happen. We created about 2200 hospital beds and I don’t think we ever used more than 120 of them. We’re now down to under 60 hospital admissions including ICU. There are a bunch of critical surgeries that got postponed and they’re trying to slam them through. Removing tumours, critical heart surgeries, and such. I hope they are not thinking my pacer has more reserve than it does. My pacemaker clinic is trying to battle on my behalf, they’re now trying to book me in multiple hospitals. I’m completely dependent on it so I’m kind of dead if it stops working. I don’t understand why the province didn’t load balance and keep some hospitals going with the essential operations and just designate some as COVID only. They basically shut down everything for COVID. You’re not understanding how far gone most of my teeth are or how many times they’ve been worked on. Most will need crowns if 
I keep them. They likely aren’t salvageable even with the crowns. The new dentist had a horrified look when she checked out the last X-ray. I guess my previous small town dentist was doing sketchy work and I didn’t know any better."

176055008,O sweet. Hows the flavor on that man.
176055009,"Sorry you are feeling so isolated and symptomatic. I hope you can find something that helps. Volunteering and later working helped me a lot to feel less lonely and locked up within myself. I hope something like that would work for you as well. I think you are right about the inward vs outward focus. It is a good answer! I think i will have a conversation with him and his social worker (he is a client still) about this and also see if he wants to do more volunteering, or volunteering that helps him more socially. I have also got a group for these volunteers, which does seem to work well for him. But he misses someone to genuinely share things with. I feel a bit inhibited because of our work relationship…He is genuinely the sweetest guy, and fun too, so i would easily invite him for something if i had met him in private - a lunch, a walk, an art activity. I wish i could give him a gf, his kid, his grandchild, a few friends. :-/"

176055019,"I’ve been re-reading some SZ material -mostly phenomenological accounts of delusion- and have reached the conclusion that while I probably suffer from sz, the diagnosis is irrelevant to the truth value of my claims. If _NAME_ famously tried to grasp the mind of god through the language of maths, I’ve come to see in psychiatric literature clear evidence of the workings of the devil’s mind. It’s not so much that psychiatry is used to discredit the possibility of true gnosis -although that’s true as well-, but that it contributes to prop up a worldview appropriate to the constraints of the demonic simulation we call the universe: the artifice of selfhood bestowed on a make-believe “mankind”, our illusory notions of the “shared world”, “other people”, the benevolence and munificence of our maker, etc. In case you’re wondering, I have full insight into why “other people” might think I’m sz, and actually, I’m OK with that. I will not go now into the details of my private t

176055031,"I think my ego has been diminished through the vast majority of my life. I have always had very altruistic thoughts, even as a child. I have not stood up for myself and my own interests, and let other people win on the expense of me not arguing anything. I had this idea in my head like real life was almost supposed to be like the sitcom “friends”, where everyone gets along perfectly. I think this way of thinking may have contributed to my psychosis. After meds it got even worse. Now I’m finding it again though. I am thinking more of myself which is a good thing. Looking out for your own interests is not the same as beeing egoistic. It has taken me a long time to reach this conclusion."

The biochemical estimation was done on 21 d.Results: The different concentrations of fresh pyrus communis juice was assayed. When pyrus communis juice (PCJ) was administered chronically for 21 d remarkably decreased ketamine induced falling, head-bobbing, weaving and turning counts. Administration of Pear juice significantly delayed the latency time taken by the animals to climb the pole in Cook
s pole climb apparatus. In swim induced grooming behaviour model, Pear juice significantly reduced swim induced grooming behaviour. Moreover, Pear juice significantly decreased the brain dopamine levels and inhibited acetyl cholinesterase activity. In the present study, Pear juice significantly enhanced reduced glutathione levels in the brains of mice, thereby reflecting enhanced scavenging of free radicals and in turn preventing occurrence of psychotic attack.Conclusion: The present study revealed that pyrus communis juice possessed significant anti-psychotic activity. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304539168_Antipsychotic_Potentials_of_Ocimum_sanctum_Leaves The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antipsychotic potential of Ocimum sanctum in experimental animal models. Male Wistar rats (180-220 g) and albino mice (25-30 g) were used for the study. The antipsychotic effect of the Ocimum sanctum was evaluated on haloperidol induced catalepsy, cooks pole climbing apparatus, locomotor activit
y on actophotometer, ketamine induced stereotype behavior. Different groups of rats were fed orally with a specially prepared diet containing various concentrations (2% w/w, 4% w/w and 8% w/w) of Ocimum sanctum leaves paste (OCLP) for 15 consecutive days. Further, the biochemical estimations were done by estimating brain dopamine levels. The OCLP produced significant dose dependent potentiation of haloperidol (1mg/kg, i.p.) induced catalepsy in rats, significantly increased the time taken by the rat to climb the pole in dose dependent manner, significantly decreased the locomotor activity. The OCLP significantly decreased ketamine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) induced stereotyped behavior in a dose dependent manner. Ocimum sanctum leaves paste (OCLP) significantly decreased the brain dopamine levels. The results suggest that OCLP posse’s antipsychotic activity. Further neurochemical investigation can explore the mechanism of action of the plant drug with respect to anti-dopaminergic functions and help to establish the p
lant as an antipsychotic agent."
174355936,"I take 800mg Amisulpride a day, and 5mg Aripiprazole designed to lower the prolactin. My last blood test after being on Aripiprazole for a month showed an increase rather than a decrease. The doctor wants to give it more time, but I am uneasy about continuing on this path. The problem is the Amisulpride has kept me sane from positive symptoms now for over two years, and I am hesitant to change it. That said, I don’t like this ‘hidden’ side effect, as I have suffered much more pronounced ones on other medications, and this just scares me that it’s causing this, but the doctor says the benefit of taking the med outweighs the risk of coming off it. Without this med I’d probably have to take Clozapine, as I have pretty much exhausted all other options."

Thought I was in an alternate universe, could talk to spirits, that my friends were impostors, et cetera. I didn’t receive treatment for six months, until I became catatonic for 12 hours and was taken to the ER. If I didn’t know the details of my uncle’s prodrome, I probably never would have guessed.

I have like zero motivation to eat besides when my stomach becomes unbearably hungry. I don’t experience thirst much so I haven’t been drinking much water trying to force.myself though. I’m horribly depressed today And my gender dysphoria has been really bad for the past couple days that i want to harm my genitals tho I wont.

It’s almost like each episode had it’s own core theme, and the really bad ones were when it all came together. Dealing with other people has always been problematic for me, and with the added stress of thought broadcasting, I know exactly what bile your inner voice is spewing to try and provoke a reaction from innocent bystanders. Just remember, each time you try and provoke other people with your thoughts, and nothing happens, use that evidence and try and convince yourself logically that this is not real, and other people do not have this deceitful power over your mind.

174355980,"It’s difficult for me to even ask the questions, but through my poor Google research I find that I should dig further to reach a poor self diagnosis of some things I deal with mentally. I refuse to be medicated, if thats even necessary, so I find a doctor to be unnecessary cause that’s pretty much all they can do. Anyways I have schizophrenia in my family I believe my grandmother on my mom’s side was actually diagnosed and my mother has been goin through what I would unprofessionally call episodes since 2011. She recently told me she still believes the government or former bosses of hers are controling her or sending her electronic pulses and stuff. I tried to get her to a doctor to get evaluated that was a disaster we didn’t speak for 2 years. But besides my family history I have belived half heartedly in the mystical all my life since I was about 7th grade so 13 or 14 years old I’m 25 now. I get dreams from and awake conversations from those who passed in my family I catch glimpses of t
hings like people or dark shadows in the corner of my eye I’m terrified of the dark. Trust is a wierd thing for me, I can trust someone but there will be a million visions in my head of a million ways that person could betray me. I have fake conversations with alive people too but I know it’s all unreal but I put some stock into the conversations with my late relatives. Ive gone through suicidal episodes but I believe I’m too much of a coward to actually do that and now I have a 2 year old daughter I love too much to ever leave her. Matter of fact I managed to choose a man who has been able to support this little family while I stay home and take care of it. The isolation and stability for the past 4 years has helped me see the fluctuation in my emotions. Some days I wake up and feel that my husband has betrayed me in some way or that he hates me and this man is a God send he loves me so much and has never done anything remotely sketchy to have me think that. I could catch a smell can it make me think t
hat he did something we spend every waking second together so the paranoia is uncalled for. Also when I had my daughter the visons of everything bad that could ever happen would go through my mind 24/7 I started to believe that I was getting signals of someone else’s desires in my head like radio interference. But I know that’s not true. I ended up taking anti anxiety medication for a few months but really it pissed me off. I want control it’s my mind I should be able to think myself the right direction…well that about sums it up, any comments advice would be greatly appreciated. I’ve been rea ding some other discussions and you all seem really great non judgmental group of people that I can lay out my mind for evaluation, yall pick it apart lol."

I do my intake on Wednesday. I am pretty excited. First I’ll be evaluated by a nurse practitioner and measured by an assistant. Then I’ll be introduced to a Nutritionist and a Personal Trainer and appointments will be scheduled with them. I will see the Nutritionist once a week and the Personal Trainer twice a week. I will be doing exercises that take in consideration my physical pain. Which will really help. I can’t wait to get started."

I’ve been dealing with schizoafective disorder for 10 years. My son has been having hallucinations and depression for the past few years. He is 12 years old now. He is on an antidepressant and an anti- sichotic and he is often scared from his hallucinations. I am able to help him cause I know what he is going through. At the same time I’ll never forgive myself because I gave it to him! I’ve just felt lately that this messed up world is overwhelming and I’m glad I found this forum as it seems very supportive. I especially appreciate how we can be honest and open here without being afraid ppl are going to freak out.

176055427,"Always Always own if you can. Look at it this way. If you rent for 10 years then move out that is it, all your money is lost. If you own (pay a mortgage), you can sell you house at the end of the 10 years and get your money back (possibly more). Same goes with cars, I will never lease. I own my vehicle, so even if I don’t have a job or money no one is going to take it away from me. If you have a lease, and you can’t pay for some reason (You lost your job during the pandemic) they’ll take your car away. Renting and leasing is just throwing your money away, you’ll never get it back because you don’t have an asset. Once you stop the rent/lease you lose your home/car and you’re out on the side walk with nothing. Renting is only useful if it is going to be for a short period of time, like renting a house to live in during University or renting a car while on vacations, etc… IMHO"

It is a well known site and gives enough money to afford my apartment, but I won’t mention the site. I also write for a local newspaper. I live in America and am proud of my country.

176055430,"Like with my schizophrenia everything seems deterministic and changes according to quantum events or fluctuations in my life-- from small things to big things. Just because I don’t know or can’t predict it doesn’t make it random. I mean it feels subjectively random (even objectively) to most people on this planet, but I always been a naysayer about the existence of true randomness. I don’t think anyone truly knows in this world even though most think they know the truth. (I don’t know either). That I would say X happens because X was supposed to happen and Y didn’t because it wasn’t possible or meant to be…lol. Like I’m alive due to certain factors or events playing out and fate, destiny, and alien help and quantum physics, not because of other factors. I sometimes bring my faith into it and chance or luck or whatnot like karma. I’ve seen the worst of humanity and the worst of people. Like a constant delusion I have is we live in a computer simulation or program (never figured o
ut how it works but maybe stochastic processes or quantum markov/_NAME_ stuff lol???). So each simulation/universe is run on a super computer and changes according to the initial inputs or variables and is predictable and time would be an illusion or not exist per se. Then a parallel universe would be like a network of super computers or parallel processing(?). I don’t know. Thoughts? People say it’s a delusion but it feels really real like I was there in other simulations or universes or worldlines and history was changed, altered, or I was in a different computer simulation completely. I figured aliens sent my consciousness/soul there into a parallel ‘me’ in a parallel universe in a ‘past life.’ For those that know me, I seem to wake up/reincarnate in 2013ish (approx.) and relive my life starting from that year and previous stuff never changes for me (no quantum branching/splitting even via the electron…). (So is that a causal loop or time travel stuff?). I often feel like that is part of my m
ental illness (causing it) and that no wonder I’m sick because most people have no memory or perception of such things. Thoughts, theories? I guess I’m coming from a computer science angle here where the universe is a matrix (consciousness included) just like the original first movie. Thank you!"

176055474,My doctor actually wanted to try me on that but I didn’t want to. Maybe I’ll give it a try and talk to my doc next time I see her
176055475,"Yeah, I had this sort of thoughts broadcasting via radio around 2004 or 2005. I thought everyone on the radio was watching me and playing a game with me like the cat plays with a mouse. This sort of delusion went away after I took antipsychotics."
176055476,What are they gonna change to?
176055477,Ok. Have you worked while on Ssdi _AT_MENTION_?
176055478,I take garlic supplements and since I have got rid of my low blood sugar attack’s I think it supresses my appetite a little also and I am starting to loose weight

176055482,Maybe you could do an art project tomorrow or redo the layout of your bedroom. It’ll keep you busy until your mom gets home.
176055483,"Yes, I’m aware of that. I was thinking generally about schizoid pd as you had chosen to mention it. I think we also have to consider whether what we enjoy and prefer is always completely healthy for us."

174356014,"I’m sorry to hear you had traumatic experiences and had to suffer being bullied. I wanted to mention that I have a similar feeling about who I am. I don’t exactly wonder who I am, I just feel like that I was someone else before the onset of the illness. Sometimes I feel like that person died, or that it was sort of a dream. I know technically, I am still the same person, but my life changed making me wonder about the person I was in a sense."
176055487,"I’m on 3mg risperidone since some years. I have a new heater in my room. But my window always stays open. I rarely close it. Today is 5° Celsius. Sometimes I need to lay under the blanket, most of the time not. I don’t like when it’s so hot that I sweat. Still wearing enough closes."
176055488,It’s so bad the government hospital was too busy to admit you. Probably a private hospital would be a good idea. Any way you need to take good care of yourself.
176055489,I hope you will.
176055490,"Fast food once a day is actually quite a lot. I also had high cholesterol when eating fast food just once a day every day. The only way I lowered mine was through reducing my fast food intake. You really should not have it more than once a week. That stuff is really, really bad for your body."
176055491,"A couple days ago I explained that at the beginning of this week, I began a new program of adhering to a routine that I planned out and write down (well, “write” – I put it in my phone in Things app). In this thread I described the system - Bringing order to my life I’d like to report that it’s been 3 days of the best days I’ve had all year! I’m achieving so much in terms of productivity and creativity. I spend less time ranting about the voices and more time in my selected office room getting personal work done. I feel more secure when there is this structure in my life. I’ve haven’t been this excited about my progress in a long time! I plan on continuing this program for 2 weeks, than re-evaluating to see if I was able to stick with it, or whether it needs to be modified or adjusted. Also what my results were. Here’s a song dedicated to my friend _AT_MENTION_ and the rest of the music fans on the forum. It’s The Doors singing I’ve been down so long, that it looks like up t

176055494,"_USER_ID_ takes a toll, unfortunately. I told people at my last job about my illness because they kept asking why I always seemed to be on edge and that didn’t go over so well. It was additional fodder for the people who already wanted to throw me under the bus. It’s worth mentioning, though, that I worked with ????????. Do you think the people you volunteer with would be accepting of your condition?"
176055495,No need to be sorry
176055496,"_AT_MENTION_ just went through this with his job. He has a thread on this School and Work section Here , and I wanted to tag him here so he can answer directly to you."
176055497,Interesting. Still not sure if I meet the criteria though. Seems really vague when it comes to mental health issues.

174356015,What causes you to be admitted? Is it hallucinations or delusions? Or just all out manic mayhem?
176055501,"So I talked to my caseworker yesterday and she told me about my states rehab department and how they can find me a job in my field and cover for me when I’m sick. I’m kinda amazed by this and I’m actually starting to get excited for life now that I have the right supports. I’ve been having some symptoms lately but I’m figuring how to handle that as well. On top of that my friends have been really great lately. I’ve been spending a lot of time with my best friend, who I’ve been best friends with for like 9 years, even though we needed space when I was psychotic. I also talked to my caseworker about my dating issues and I’m amazed how people up north don’t care at all if you are gay, as I had a completely different experience when I lived in the south. I’m really happy about where I live and how I’m doing right now. I almost am glad that I had to move back home because of my illness because otherwise I wouldn’t have the life I have right now."
174356023,How long did it take to find relief? I gave it 2 months
176055502,I wouldnt change the dose on my own. Does your Dr know?

176055509,"I thought about that, And I thought about it being from sex too. But these are fresh bruises from last night. I didn’t do anything to my ankles yesterday or touch them and I didn’t have sex last night or the night before."
176055510,I guess I got lucky finding a good therapist on my first try. But I’m stil going to keep a close eye on things. I still have slight trust issues when it comes to these therapists. The slightest sign of deception or abuse and she’s history. I’m not going to accept any kind of nonsense like I did with my last therapist.
176055511,"At first I thought there was something wrong with my kidneys because I didn’t have to go, but then I realized I do have to go, I just don’t feel it, so I started just checking every couple of hours to make sure. I do have a bulging disc, it could be cutting off sensation, I bet that’s what it is."
176055512,Great before and after pictures _AT_MENTION_. Well done.
176055513,"There’s a book called you can heal your life by _NAME_ hay . Maybe that book and some therapy and professional help can help you. I had voices that tortured me years ago but they never wanted me to kill. They wanted me to kill self I think and that others were going to kill me. I had paranoia and delusions about my pets but loved them anyway through it all. I once called my sacred neigh ugly but I was talking to those who were in her body and told them to leave her body. I wasn’t calling her that but those I thought were in her body. I thought my dog was laughing at my suffering once so I put her in the bedroom and closed the door and said “you think that’s funny”(yelled) but then I cuddled her as always. I always fed them and loved them more than I can say. I have never been violent. I am a ethical vegan so I try to avoid killing. Admittedly I might kill cockroaches if they try take over my home but I don’t want to hurt anyone. I want peace, love ,kindness and I want to be empathetic,c
ompassionate,kind,caring and loving . It’s not cool to murder which some people think it is . Probably because of tv shows etc I hope you will seek help. Don’t hurt anyone! Be kind to yourself and others. Ask for help. Wishing you peace and well."

175101690,My social worker drove me all the way downtown today to get my Covid vaccination. It took an hour of waiting in line but it was uneventful. The injection didn’t hurt. It just felt like a tiny poke. And I didn’t have an allergic reaction either. It is now 9 hours later and I don’t feel sick or headachey at all. I return in 3 weeks for my second Covid vaccination. So far so good.

176055535,"You’re worthy of SOME attention. Maybe due to what you’ve already done and said. Saying all the right things NOW is akin to superficial public relations. As though you’re the bigger man… you’re the one turning the page, but in reality you’re only “going quietly” to foster thought. You’re just slinking off after filling me with negative inspiration/emotion. I wish you’d just react… and say what you want to say… ."
176055536,? can t remember.sorry
176055537,I hear you. When my son was being sent to the hospital far from our home I had no time to pack anything. I left all my meds at home. I was in a lot of pain all week. It’s hell forgetting your meds.
176055538,I’m so happy for you! You worked hard to find the right job and now you are rewarded. I hope it is all you hope for! I’m also happy for you that you are feeling stable. The right meds make all the difference.

176055543,"But you shouldn’t have to live one day at a time, knowing tomorrow might change. I think we all need some permanence of some sort. Otherwise, it’s hard to establish a routine, and those can be critical to your well-being."

176055547,"I have been riding my bicycle as usual. Many restaurants are closed, a few flea markets are closed, one place where they sell old items such as paintings and furniture is closed. I visited briefly one art exhibition today, I was the only visitor there, also visited one store where they sell old military clothing, a sales person said that it has been very quiet there. People are still driving their cars and a few people have been riding their bicycles. Everything is becoming quiet, not yet a ghost town. This reminds me of the situation in Miami Beach after the 911 when tourists did not come, it was really quiet there too. I remember walking around and only a few people were there, restaurants were open, but there were no visitors."
174356021,I am anxious frequently. I could have schizoaffective but anxiety is also common with bipolar. Among other issues I suffer with Agoraphobia and OCD. Earlier on I suffered with panic disorder.
176055548,"That’s how it was with me. One year for the initial break with reality and destruction of property driving me to homelessness, one year slowly picking up the pieces and getting medicine adjusted, a year of getting back in my family’s good graces after lots of improvement, and through to now where I haven’t had a strong delusional thought in over a year. I’ve improved a LOT since six years ago, and I kept hope alive by just reading positive statements by professionals that said that a lot of people get better with age."

176055555,"ScienceDaily Synchronization of brain hemispheres changes what we hear Most of the time, our brain receives different input from each of our ears, but we nevertheless perceive speech as unified sounds. This process takes place through synchronization of the areas of the brain involved with the help of gamma waves,... “Our results suggest that gamma wave-mediated synchronization between different brain areas is a fundamental mechanism for neural integration,” says _PERSON_. “Moreover, this research shows for the first time, using human hearing as an example, that the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain can be successfully modulated by electric stimulation,” These findings could thus also find clinical application in the near future. “Previous studies show that disturbances in the connection between the two hemispheres of the brain are associated with auditory phantom perceptions such as tinnitus and auditory verbal hallucinations,” _PERSON_ adds. “Thus, electric brain s

174356031,"I guess it’s a hard skew to the left in terms of income and success. Hell, I’d be happy making a 2-3 grand a month right now and I’d be ecstatic to make 4k+ a month. Right now I just get SSI. I’m sure people do it, but most aren’t on this forum posting. It must be a huge outlier, anomaly, or black swan type of thing. I’d imagine most are inheriting their family’s money. But I’d imagine most are destined for poverty and sadness. There’s so many variables out there it’s hard to understand from a layman’s view. I want to get my education and make money programming things. It’s not impossible, but I got some other factors beyond schizophrenia affecting me. I’m 31 years old. If all else fails, I got a small special needs trust. I hope to make it last the rest of my life when my father passes and I hope to die young. It’s enough to supplement or even replace SSI. Not sure what I would do for health insurance though. I couldn’t afford it. I would need government assistance or 
work part time or go on generics. No way I could afford 400+ dollars a month in any kind of bills then or now. Programmers/engineers/developers can make 60k-150k a year."

Unfortunately he ended his life yesterday at 31 years old after proposing to I think his exgf via Twitter. His last tweets mentioned him feeling crazy.

I just want peace. I am not what my mind is making me out to be.
176055565,If someone thought their thoughts about maybe being gay drove them to psychosis then I’d say that’s a pretty clear sign of some deep anxieties and possibly homophobia. And also that it’s not possible. People can live through extremely traumatic stuff without any signs of developing psychosis. Possibly being gay or hating yourself for that is not something that can cause psychosis and I’ve never in my life heard of that happening.

174356041,That sounds very difficult to do. I don’t know if this is healthy for you to accomplish. It could even turn out to be more damaging for you. Does your therapist have experience working with schizophrenic clients?
176055569,"Thanks for voting & commenting, all of you. I notice I get a bit insecure and confused, because the explanation of what I have changes all the time. It is kind of a difference whether you have a pd, sz/sza or autism. Next week I will speak to the psychiatrist. And I’m not from the USA. I don’t think I’m recovered enough to be declared normal. Last time a psychologist told me I was normal, I was in a closed ward a few months later. The disability people actually warned me NOT to go to work, because my illness would not allow that. And they give me help in the household."

176055573,"Earlier today, my mom was asking me to go out for an outing with some church people. I have a fear against people around my age in my country because I was bullied and abused by my peers/teachers. I started to become really negative of myself. I told my mom that I wasn’t going and I was really exhausted to go anywhere else. This is true because my health has been failing me lately. However, I just didn’t want to hang out and I wanted to be isolated. I hate other people now so much, that I just want to remain alone. I just feel like other people will feel that I’m a burden. I told my mom a strong “no”. When my mom came home with my brother, she was talking to me about my ex-boyfriend. As soon as I thought about him, I couldn’t stop thinking about how my ex-boyfriend broke up with me because of my mental health issues and it made me feel unwanted. I started hating myself even more. In an instant, I wanted to erase my new facebook account and deactivate it. I wanted to shut people out and 
be alone. Alone, unwanted, and by myself. I thought that it was my punishment for being so horrible to people. Everything is fear for me. The environment is hostile as ever, and I just can’t associate with others. Everyone could be a danger. Everyone could comment on how I walk, and how I am disabled. People are going to judge my mother for being a disabled child’s parent. I just want to remain alone, forever. If I would want to go outside, I would go out by myself, never with anyone. Sure, I could go out with my family, but I would NEVER go out with anyone else- not even church friends. Not happening. I’ve been told to never talk about my disabilities outside of this house. My brother is already sick of me and he’s just holding himself together. He even yelled at me before. My father is tired of my sickness. I’m ruining this household. If I ever show myself walking abnormally, I am thus putting my family in danger and I could make them suffer and have shame. My family could have a thousand comments 
from everyone at church, asking the most private questions. I am ruining this family. What if my dad’s extended family knows about my disabilities? That will ruin our family’s reputation. I just really hate myself and I just want to be alone. I want to be alone. I’m an abomination. I hate myself. I really need to be alone for the rest of my life."
176055574,You meant to say Serbia right?
176055575,Never give that option. Yes say to mind there is no such option. The thing is if you allow such thoughts to come to mind it will eventually get stronger. When such thoughts come forcefully think of some other or do some other activity and thus distract yourself from such.

176055584,When I was on Invega sustenna I had a lot more energy
176055585,Hows the invega working? Im having memory lapses on it. Did you get the 250 something to start?
176055586,I’m still in bed and it’s 11:30 here. Feeling lazy and tired and pretty symptomatic. I think I’ll try for a low key day. Maybe shower and cook some food.

176055587,Made some money at my part time job. Meditated. Showered and shaved.
176055588,"Yes, I think it can be stressful for a lot of people. But personally, my curiosity about things tends to override my fear of knowing."
176055589,"I don’t think Abilify is considered an AP anymore. When I was on the drug it did some good things for me, but in the end it got me a little too jittery. They had to take me off it."

176055593,"I tried it. For like 8 months up to 350mg Sr It didn’t help me much. I had some sensory overload anxiety from it. One day was walking downtown it was very loud from cars going by. I basically had an anxiety attack from the noise, it lasted for like 4 hours Initially strange euphoria but I don’t think any mania I tried it at 100, 150, 300 , 350."

176055597,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ thankyou. I hope it’s not really real.
176055598,"I can hear their _USER_ID_, they know I’m stressed out. They come around when I’m stressed out. When my emotions aren’t stable. I cant get myself under control so I can faintly hear them. I’m scared to look around. I’m scared I’ll see them. It’s been so long since I’ve seen them. I dont want them back. I dont want to be alone because I fear I won’t actually be alone. I’m afraid that they’ll be waiting for me. I know that they’re waiting. Waiting to catch me off guard a little so that they can come back into my life. No pdoc to help me. No insurance. I hate everything. I want to curl up and disappear into a space of nothingness where no one and nothing can reach me."

176055600,"I internet date. It’s led to a couple flings. Just be yourself. I’ve had good luck with having my favorite music on my profile, then people with similar tastes comment on it and we get down to chatting. I’ve found that people that are a bit older (30s and 40s is older to me) tend to want to meet earlier and have a good sense of humor, so that should be good for you. Remember you can back out at anytime, and remember to always meet someone for the first time in a public place."
176055601,Gonna give it another week and ask my doc if we can change things if it doesn’t improve…
176055602,"Thank you, _AT_MENTION_ and _AT_MENTION_ It’s still bad in social settings but I’m handling stress better in everyday life at home."
174356040,"I once asked my psychiatrist about Geodon, but she said it’s nowhere near strong enough for me. I was curious about it as an addition to the Abilify shots, but instead she added 5 mg Haldol twice a day. The Haldol is quite helpful. It takes a lot of medication to treat me. Besides the Abilify shots and Haldol tablets I have to take two antidepressants at high doses to keep me from killing myself, a mood stabilizer, and Cogentin (for Haldol side effect)."

176055604,"When studying the causal relationship between any chemical change and the sz condition. A distinction must be made between two contradictory phenomena: 1-The change in the substances (D/S or G) precedes the sz condition and causes it This is what all current theories suggest,and is not related to the realism of the sz condition. the problem, there is no actual genetic cause for the chemical change 2-The independent functional activity of the pathogen in the conscious mind precedes the chemical change and causes it (qualitatively and quantitatively ) This is the reality of the sz condition,which differs about the content of all current theories the pathogen itself which represented in the hallucination is the root cause for the chemical change In other meaning,the independent functional activity of the pathogen in the conscious mind of the person generate the chemical change"

176055606,whats that mean…?
176055607,Over here they have private I’s who investigate people on benefits. You’ll find most are dobbed in by other people. It really is a crazy thing but I wouldn’t be too worried. A change of government to more liberal politic will probably see a change in that policy.
176055608,"So I want to set myself a daily food expenditure of around £5, no more than £7, including chocolate and other indulgences. I’ll keep a tab here to make sure I stick to it. Thank you."
174356048,Mate. What do you like to do? Find that then find others that like what you do. Meet people. It would be good to get out of your headspace and meet a few like minded people. I’m saying other people from AA or such…like hobby people or something. Your never too old and it’s always good. If I wasn’t playing cricket I’d be going to a political party meeting…I’d be doing a hobby. I’d like to do all 3 but too old and tired to do too much but you get my drift. Find something you can turn into an interest and meet some people outside your comfort zone. I’m sure you’d be fine.
176055609,Thanks _AT_MENTION_
176055610,I dunno man I don’t wanna believe my delusions but they seem so real it’s hard not to. So it’s a constant battle between belief and non belief. Freaking roller coaster ride.

176055614,I don’t know. I am not sure. The mental health system got me early. I was only 19.

176055617,"Hi! Peer support is a little different in every state. Generally you need to pass a 1 week crash course offered by a mental health institution in your area. The hiring process is pretty straight forward. Here, there always seems to be some availability. This is a good job for those who do not want to or cannot work too strenuously. I usually just schedule outings as fit my schedule. It has a rewarding side but I find clients typically don’t want your help. They just want to fulfill the requirements set up by their supervisors."
176055618,I have read these spy stories in the past. There was one story in one book that illustrated what had happened to one person. This person had travelled to England from Finland and spent some time there. After returning back to Finland this person started telling others that he is a CIA spy. After that this person went to the mental hospital and stayed there for a long time. I know it is easy to let the imagination to take over your mind

176055620,"As far as I know there are not any around here. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I’m going to tell him that I’m finally ready to give in to this diagnosis. Until now I’ve been in a little bit of denial, then acceptance, then denial. Maybe he knows of some."

174356053,"It doesn’t sound like schizophrenia honestly. It’s normal between sleep and awake to hear things like that. Your drs are probably right, and it’s probably stress induced. I think seeing a therapist is a great idea."

174356045,"The thing is, I have schizophrenia. Many people in group just have depression. My symptoms are probably on the severe side compared to most of them. Some of them act like their lives can’t get better like mines did but I feel some of them will be better people coming out of treatment."
176055623,why are you calling others delusional?
176055624,"Idk, I’m doing most things on my list right now. For example I’m starting to car hunt and I go running for exercise. The only thing I’m having trouble with is anxiety from work. That’s why it’ll hopefully be good practice. In fact I made this thread because I had a good Summer and am afraid Winter will be boring. What I’m hoping the most is that something unexpectedly good will happen. I’m very happy with life right now. Though I’m dirt broke and gaining weight."

But on the other side of my family, my uncle, my dad’s brother, is diagnosed sz. Another sister either has BPD or Bipolar. My oldest brother is a Narcissist. And depression and anxiety run in my family. It’s hard to know when there isn’t an open discussion. My son has sz, like me."
176055627,"APs as we all know can cause a ton of sedation. I’ve been dealing with 10-13 hours of sleep for years now. I wake up usually late afternoon and I’m sick of it, I feel like I have no time in the day for anything. When I force myself to get up early though, my mind is racing and voices are present. It’s not fun. I think maybe if I force myself up for a month in a row or something, the same time, maybe I can readjust and just go to bed earlier. Can anyone relate to this?"

176055633,I’ve been on olanzapine since 1997. I’ve gained weight but I didn’t blimp out. The weight I gained fits my frame. I’m not overly concerned about it. I’d rather not experience psychosis again. I have no problem taking it. Of all the meds I’ve tried olanzapine had to the most tolerable side effects.
174356051,900mg is the limit. I take 500mg a day and it has really helped me. I hope it works for you as well.
176055634,Thing is those topics actually get shut down or have TW. Sex seems to get overlooked though despite being a sensitive subject
176055635,oh my gosh I’m sorry to hear that
174356055,"Its a minor theory, its very rare if possible. The strongest currently used theory for positive symptoms is the dopamine theory. For negative symptoms its the glutamate theory. New meds use both theories to treat positive and negative symptoms like Lumateperone. We have a user here who is recently on Lumateperone."
176055636,"Every day it happens often, I want to do something and poof I forget what I was about to do. I keep trying to remember, sometimes for hours, occasionally I remember it after a few hours. Sometimes they’re important things like taking my meds and my psy apt. I am only 30 y.o. Anyways, I told my psy and he said to setup an alarm in my cellphone. I did it with the 2 cellphones I use and its working pretty well. Never had psychosis since I setup the alarms last year."

176055640,"I think voices are “born” from having unfulfilled emotional needs or unprocessed emotional trauma, and it’s the brain’s way of shifting the responsibility/burden of those feelings so the person doesn’t get overwhelmed. Kind of like how people with DID dissociate when their emotions get too strong and let someone else take over for a while."
176055641,Telepathy doesn’t exist.
176055642,"There is a whole universe out there, one physicist I know asked the question “does the moon exist when we are not looking at it?”, it is the wrong question, the question is what can we see with our own three eyes and skin, I still don’t know who my father is, whether he be from this world or beyond? My relatives would do well to bring up others as they have brought up me."
176055643,_AT_MENTION_ Its great that you pushed through and got up and back to routine! Awesome that you spoke with someone on your treatment team - that’s so important!
176055644,"No, I still have delusions and voices"
176055645,To give you an example - my area has not much thunderstorms and then I had to go stay in an area for four months where there were tons of them I was exposed almost three times a week for four months to these horrendous storms After all that exposure my fear got worse. My nerves suffered so much I had to move back home Now when it even just rains hard I sometimes get scared So sometimes exposure made it worse So I just learn to live with it
176055646,I have no other choice. I don’t know how the admission system works in my country. I know that you can’t just take yourself to the ward to get admitted. I’ve never been admitted in my country so I have no idea.
176055647,They tell me that their making a movie out of my life just cuz I smoked ciggorets and that it was like eating the forbidden fruit from the garden of _NAME_ cuz it was the one thing I was wasn’t supposed to do but I couldn’t quit the the thoughts and urge was to much
176055648,I know it’s awful the way they charge you and in my state if you don’t pay your bill then they won’t see you and I can’t risk losing my pdoc because of it I applied for ssdi in May and I’m hoping and praying it goes thru and doesn’t take 2 years So I can get in that insurance

174356064,So far so good. The abilify is helping my therapist noticed a difference today. She gave me homework today though. I feel a little manic but I called my pdoc because I was worried about it her nurse called and said it normal as long as it’s not out of control one suggestion she made was less caffeine. So I’m down to one cup of coffee a day. The voices are lessening but I can hear them sometimes.

176055664,"My partner and I lived next to some real shallow neighbours. They were like barbie and _PERSON_ dolls, thought they were better than everyone else. They were a bit contemptuous to us. They used to fight all the time…I mean all the time. So loud we could hear what they were saying most of the time. I’m not gonna lie, we got some enjoyment out of it."
176055665,"Ijust rest a lot when a flare hits. I used to exercise through them but had to leave the gym w hen we moved. Tramadol works best paired with something like naproxen. On its own it doesn’t do much. I also have a muscle relaxant, flexiril."
176055666,Then please frame your advice within these boundaries. I’ve seen studies too where brain games and other such things aren’t any difference to anybody. That isn’t an unpublished thing and it’s been shared here before. Please. What works for you may not work for others and we get a lot of people here who are struggling. Please refrain from recommending things as though they work for everyone because they don’t.

I keep running budgets to see how long it’s going to take me to pay it all off. It’s pretty scary stuff. Are you going into debt for Christmas?"

176055688,"If you meditate then you can actually get self control. It trains the mind to do just that. Sit in a straight backed chair, rest your hands on your legs, close your eyes and say the word Compassion in your head over and over again. Simple as.

Laboratory normal limits are defined as including 97.5% of the population, which contains all values of TSH below approximately 4.5 ?IU/mL. In a population screened to eliminate anyone with evidence of thyroid disease or elevated levels of thyroid antibodies, 90%?95% of TSH values are below 2.5 ?IU/mL."
174356078,When is the point that we have to take action like many others have done to undo the _USER_ID_ of our label Schizophrenia? Many others have succeeded in pushing back. Why has this not happened for us and what would you like to be done about it?

176055704,"My life quality took a big hit too, but I was in jail for part of it so I learned what it’s like to have absolutely nothing. I didn’t even have underwear for 5 months because I was too out of my mind to understand how the commissary worked. Now I view every day I’m out like I get to be king, with a nice TV and computer and good food. I can’t really work a job any more with the voices though, it is far too distracting. I’m sorry you’re feeling like crap but it does get slightly better over time, at least for me it did. I started having problems 6 years ago and I’ve recovered a lot since then. I don’t think I’ll ever be where I was before but I’m no longer suicidal. Are you on an antipsychotic? It took me like a year plus of trying different ones until I found one that worked for me but I think it’s something every schizophrenic has to go through if they want to feel better."

I’m hoping its a good thing and praying i dont get unwell again, i’m doing everything i can to remain positive and keeping a good outlook"
174356088,Did u have same symptoms?
176055733,Happened quarentine
176055734,Last time I went to doctor He prescribed me with less medication He told me to stop quetiapine totally and go on other medication as it is It is the third week since I visited him I am very unhappy Tired either sleep or awake May be I all take nuclear option and use medication or supplements I never used before
176055735,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ . I agree with _AT_MENTION_ . We just have to accept the burden of side effects - my GP told me all ap’s cause obesity and diabetes. So I try to eat very healthy food and I exercise just about every day. I’ve done lots of research on diet & exercise that’s best for my age group, mid 40’s. It’s very different to what I thought…diet of only 15% protein (meat/fish) and short workouts of high intensity interval training. I think it’d be good if you do some research for the best diet & exercise for your age group, 25."

Just to say, i take Zyprexa and only Zyprexa/Olanzapine, yes, it has its side effect but it works for me, no negative symptom ‘‘depression’’. But i weight 230 lbs on 20mg of Zyprexa. I rater be on a weight meds than with Invega Sustenna after i stopped medication to start exercise and loose weight as i tried, it worked but i went back to the hospital, and thats when Invega Sustenna injection almost killed me with heart ache problem and akathisia. So, went back to Zyprexa and accepted my schizophrenia, and everything worked out."
176055736,Congrats on getting into a masters! I agree on not really needing the lectures. Thats one thing I really like about remote learning. I get really anxious and paranoid in a classroom setting so this has been a good solution. I hope things work well for you! Remember that most people in academia feel some sort of imposter syndrome so I’m sure you aren’t alone.

176055740,"_AT_MENTION_ LOL, yeah you’ve got to lower your standards and settle with women in your league and not women out of your league. I’m sorry to say but the guy has to take the initiative with the woman he’s interested in. That includes getting into physical shape, dressing better and holding a job with income. However, depending on the woman you are approaching, they migh lower their standards about you as well."
174356076,Treat your local schizophrenic to breakfast at _USER_ID_’s to celebrate.
176055741,Wow! That’s amazing
176055742,"In fact, often, i feel my brain is a mess… I think a lot though, but i never ‘‘trust’’ my thinking, so its painful… Why i dont have a normal thinking lol??? I also have a bunch of physical sensations inside my ead, which is way too much… I dont find, that the aps fix the thinking… Or maybe my mind is not at peace… But the point is to be at peace with some thinking i find… When i talk, i still have the impression, that i say crazy things, while everyone says, that i say normal things … Does someone else doesnt trust his thinking like this? I lack this spark of life in my mind… I dont know what i lack precisely in my head tbh… I wish i could have trusted my thinking, but so that its ok too… I dont know at all what is to feel ok on the side of the thoughts, yeah…"
176055743,Best wishes _AT_MENTION_
176055744,"The root definition of reverse paranoia is perhaps stated most poignantly in a _NAME_ by _PERSON_. In his Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters (1963), the character _NAME_ portrays himself in this manner: “I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.”"
176055745,oh that’s annoying. I would talk to your pdoc and see if they can adjust some meds if you keep having this.
176055746,Ye not scared anymore Idk
176055747,It was just a film _AT_MENTION_ . But it messed up a lot of vulnerable schizophrenics.

176055749,"Sometimes I refuse to make friends because I know that they will hurt me. I’ve realized that friends are just friends. In the end they don’t care. I used to have friends but it’s no use since they are so far away now. It will take years for me to go and visit them. By that time, they would not remember me because they’ve seen me like 10 years ago. There are two types of people: people who pretend to care, and people who try to take advantage of you. In the end it’s like “none of my business” kinda thing. Even my family wants to hide my psychosis from my brother…poor him because he believes I just have regular depression. I’ve just decided that I will not make friends. I’ve tried, though…"
176055750,"and another thing is, im too poor to live somewhere nice, so my options are limited."

176055756,Since developing sza I’ve been hallucinating just after closing my eyes to sleep. I’m fully awake but its like they wait until I have my eyes closed. Its all auditory
176055757,_AT_MENTION_ Yes. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow. I called my primary dr so she could put in my chart how much I gained after starting Zyprexa. I just wanted it noted with my primary too
176055758,My voices were constant but quiet. I have been hearing them for about 12 years. Medication helps.
176055759,"No, I dont have a psychiatrist now but Ziprasidone isn’t a partial dopamine agonist like Abilify. I think Abilify improved my negative symptoms bcz its a partial dopamine agonist, it doesn’t fully block dopamine. What do you think? Is Ziprasidone really worth it?"
174356080,Zyprexa is known for sedating effects. Abilify is known for activating effects.

All specials and changed every week. If I remember right it was a raspberry fennel and peach salad. A meat and cheese board. Goose liver, sweetbreads. Filet. Lemon sherbet. I ordered off menu an affogato, espresso shot poured over vanilla gelato. Stuffed our faces, then went to craft store, where she bought me a hand made llama fur doll. Went to bed early that night Was a good night. Last real date night. We’ve done order in and rent a movie, but we haven’t gone out like we normally would."

174356093,"last night i went through an old folder of mine and found instructions for self realization that i had printed off when i was having lots of blissful spiritual experiences a few years back. I got excited and decided to try some of the suggestions to loosen the ego which were: don’t take things personally forgive everyone and everything -be selfless ( spend part of your life helping others) -be authentic at all times (don’t put on a persona) -have fewer preferences or opinions ( especially about things that dont matter) At the time I had printed this I was really enthusiastic and excited because I thought the suggestions were spot on. Anyway last night I wanted to try and get back to my pre schizophrenia spiritual self. so i started consciously making an effort not to take things personally / forgive everyone and everything( so would cut off my thoughts about being wronged and stopped reacting to the voices) i felt more balanced. But the voices have erroded all the positive feelings I used to ha
ve for constantly berating me for every single good thought or feeling i had. so anyway I eventually fell to sleep. Then suddenly I woke up with a strong urge to cut my wrists. It really felt like the right thing to do. I had to force myself to search desperately for an ego to tell me why i shouldnt cut myself. I couldn’t remember any love that made it worth fighting but i remembered my rationalizations of why it would be cruel to my family to kill myself and so i didnt do anything. My question is, am I supposed to just give up my dreams of self realization? I know if I did cut myself I would have realized by my families reaction that they love me, though i can’t see that normally because of paranoia. I’ve been using my ego to keep me afloat, rationalizing everything, making a false self that pretends to be happy, imagining happy futures etc. But I know I can never be satisfied living entirely in my ego. I’m wondering if I should book myself into hospital and try to work out my self realization there? 
But it usually makes me hear way more voices, way more paranoid and really easily swayed. Then the other option is taking antidepressants, but last time I had to take them in hospital I was so drugged up that I thought the other people were god or something and did whatever they said, I didn’t even remember until I found photos on my phone after hospital. And the last option is to stick with my ego and try and find happiness through entertaining it with ideas of a better future. What do you think is a good idea? And thanks for reading all that…"

I went about 6 years without driving even though I had my license. I just preferred to walk everywhere. I don’t hallucinate during the day now on meds, I will occasionally get night time voices late at night before bed but I never drive at night. and they’re just whispers, a minor distraction, like listening to the radio. which I don’t typically have on while im driving either."

176055773,Im a closet Bi-sexual and have struggled with my sexuality for many years. But never has the Pdoc attributed it to my mental health. The only thing i think it affects is that i have been known to be promiscuous - with men and woman. But thats more to do with my lack of awareness of putting my self in risky situations (my Borderline PD traits).
174356090,Its good to diagnose sz early because that would have avoided my 2 suicide attempts.

176055824,An RA in college called a meeting of the house because someone had stolen an orange out of the fridge. It was me. I didn’t admit it until later. The RA was really upset and I was affected by it. I really started to doubt myself. I’m not a good person so who cares?

176055830,The pdoc has said many times within certain parameters I can tweak my meds. I moved my zoloft to bedtime and went from 500mg to 400mg clozapine. Seems a lot better already. Less agitated and zombie like. And sleep is less of an issue.
176055831,It varies. On meds now I only hear voices once every week or two. But off meds almost every day I think.

176055833,I was consuming 5 to 6 cups of coffee lately. My psychiatrist and therapist told me to cut down to my regular 2 cups a day immediately. Yesterday I had 3 cups. Too much caffeine is not healthy especially if you are diagnosed with an anxiety or depressive disorder.

176055838,After my first psychosis I used to need a night lamp on and the door open so that I didn’t feel trap. Also I didn’t like sleeping on top of my bunk bed anymore cos I felt like the ceiling was making me claustrophobic. It’s been 3 years since then I can sleep with lights off now

176055845,"Do you display inappropriate behavior during psychosis? I do, and I lose people because of it. It’s sad. Last psychosis I started texting this girl all kind of weird stuff and thought I could set up another girl with a guy because so thought it was meant to be. I sometimes sent death threats to this acquaintance that used to treat me like ????… but it’s because I am psychotic. I say inappropriate stuff and make inappropriate comments. How about you?"

176055847,"Been a little while since I have posted, but have had a hang up with the possibility of being a narcissist the last 2 years now. Recently discovering what “_NAME_ pan syndrome” is I believe I may have a case of it lol. For example, I’m still a very imagination based person, I don’t like reality very much to say the least, and my imagination is my escape, but also my worst enemy. I have trouble taking responsibility for my own actions, and become very offended at perceived slights. I’ve talked to numerous psychologists the last couple years and none of them agreed that I may be a narcissist, but I do exhibit very many characteristics of one. I’m often cold, love attention, and consider myself the smartest, most attractive person in the room. I spend way too much time theorizing, but sometimes theories are right. Anyone that cares to respond with your own opinion, I’d be interested in hearing it."

176055849,"I don’t feel like people hate me, but I do feel like I’m a burden or I bother them. I know it’s just my insecurities talking, but it’s sometimes hard to shake, especially when sometimes something happens that reinforces it."
176055850,"I found out the guy is indeed 10 years younger. Though I haven’t got any hard proof of it, I dont feel he sees me in a romantic way, which seems logical considering the age gap (which he knew before we were introduced). He is fun to dance and chat with though. Now just to get over the mini-crush and enjoy the dancing."
176055851,"I’m not sure why that is repeated over and over all over the place as the possible increase in the prefrontal cortex only is seen at extremely low doses of 0.2mg, just shows how information can be skewed in favour of drugs."

176055860,"Maybe you could try something else. Megadoses of certain B-vitamins are proven to help many people who hear voices. Even mainstream medicine is starting to aknowledge this. Dr _NAME_ discovered this in the 50’s and wrote a book about it, you might want to check it out. If it did work on you, then possibly you could be on a drug like zyprexa because the b-vitamins take care of the voices, and if it didn’t work you havr your current drug to fall back on. Could be worth a shot."

176055868,"I’m sza too. Been on seven different antipsychotics and out of them two worked well for me (risperidone and amisulpride). Had to take a mood stabiliser too. Tried valproic acid and lamotrigine. Presently on amisulpride (which helps with psychosis and hypomania) and a low dose of olanzapine (to help with depression), and also lamotrigine (also for depression and mood swings) I never tried an antidepressant because the pdocs thought it would make me manic. I have a history of hypomanic episodes, as well as severe depression."

176055885,"_NAME_, When I was in the hospitals last time for pancreatitis, my lung collapsed. It caused oxygen deprivation which had me accusing nurses of trying to poison me. Then I thought I had been moved to another hospital, except it was a replica of a commercial airplane. I was convinced they had brought everyone I had ever wronged to walk by. My ex sats were 80. I experienced brain damage. Finally, when I knew I was psychotic, I asked to be sent to the psychiatric hospital. I tried to escape, and was put in restraints. Then I thought the hospital kept people there for eternity, literally. I think you should stand up for you. I finally made it to the psychiatric hospital, on oxygen. A respiratory tech talked to me about how seriously I was ill… and that I needed to take oxygen seriously. _PERSON_ what? I listened. Advice comes from seemingly random people. Pay attention, kind sir!"

I swing wildly from feeling like I’ve made a lot of progress and maybe I’m happy to feeling really awful with how unhealthy I am. Like, I’m not as unhealthy as I was, but I’ve still got a long way to go. But my body seems to have settled here for now. So we’ll see. I’ve not really lost much weight in the last couple months. I’m down to a size 14 and my goal is at least an 8, but I’d prefer a 4/6. I’m really short, so even a size 8 looks big on me."

I must have something scheduled to wake up for in the morning or I sleep more than 12 hours. This is a big problem for me. In terms of exercise, I take a 15 minute walk sometimes. Please don’t tell me exercise is the solution to all of this. I feel tired almost all the time, and I look tired. The doctor is worried I will have a relapse if he lowers my meds. I can add that I have felt sedated from my meds for most of the 38 years I have had my illness. There has got to be some reward for what I have been through. I believe so.

176055924,"I think it this should fall under health and recovery. It is already way too complicated with too many categories. Also I don’t think we should ban talking about euthanasia. We don’t ban talking about suicide in general, even though it can be triggering, because it’s an important topic when it comes to mental health. The solution to triggering topics is not an outright ban. We even allow talking about drugs, in a recovery context. You could just add a trigger warning. Like in other cases when suicide is mentioned."

I enjoy listening to classic or new age music when im manic but I became aware that Im manic 90% of the time lol so that was a bit of a shock to me. Expanding awareness can be a transformative process, but mania/awareness at the same time can be overwhelming we are good people with a lot to learn and I hope that I can learn to slow down…I can feel the energy flowing through me–like I opened a door to the energetic dimension/and now I can feel energetic dimensions… I had to take some extra meds today to try and control it. There is nothing to be afraid of though, the gov. isn’t after people who are aware of their spiritual self we just nneed to be responisble with our energy and makeup… Medications dont repress me.

176055941,"Congratulations, how long did it take?"
176055942,"Thanks, everyone. Today is a better day. _PERSON_ helped fix the things he broke, and we talked more about how feeling guilty is his mind’s way of trying to teach him not to behave that way anymore. We talked about personal responsibility, and how it feels like we have no control over our actions when we are triggered, but we actually do."
176055943,"And that’s assuming you’re not exercising. If you’re working out a lot then sometimes you do need that many calories. I ate 3 to 4 times a day during summer marching band, usually some cereal or something for breakfast, then large meals, often fast food, the rest of the day and I still lost a good amount of weight (good amount as in I fit into my slightly chubby younger brother’s shorts, and I’m five and a half years older than him and was about 5 inches taller than him at the time). Obviously, I’m not suggesting you _NAME_ on fast food 2 to 3 times per day. It’s really not healthy, and I probably would’ve had a heart attack had I been 25 years older. A heart attack, a stroke, GERD, diabetes, kidney stones, gall stones… all the conditions. Anyway, what I’m getting at is that 3500 calories really isn’t that bad, especially if you work out a lot, and even if you don’t, it’ll probably take a lot more than one cheat day to make you start gaining any real weight back."
176055944,What did you actually say dude? You can pm me.
176055945,Yeah _AT_MENTION_ as _NAME_ says a car is a good thing to have. I’ve lived without but going to the city twice a week makes for a 45 minute trip and I can leave or arrive when I like. If I take a train it’s an hour and a half trip and if I miss a train it’s longer. Also. Car has stereo and is so much more easy to get places. Yeah I beotch that it costs me money but keeping them on the road is a worthy expense.

176055952,In your situation you really have no choice so basically go along with what they decide and try not to let it bother you. When you turn 18 you can choose your own doctor and make the final decision on what meds you take. Fighting or resisting when youre in confinement only makes things worse especially when you have no legal recourse.

So does anyone know the theory for treating schizophrenia that they use? Has anyone had success with it?

Eventually I wrote him a detailed email explaining in an assertive way why I cannot see him anymore. Then once he replied I deleted that email account and blocked him everywhere. After letting him know so. I think it’s really important that you maybe give him an as detailed explanation of why you can’t. And if he continues to harass you afterwards then just warn him that you have no choice but to block him for your own health. Or you can even tell him that now. But check with some professionals if this is safe idea cos idk everything about you And him. Idk if you feel prepared to take action like that.

It is a passion of mine. I make rustic cakes. Truthfully i can’t do anything too fancy with sugar work or anything like that, so that is one reason why my cakes are rustic. The other reasons is i just prefer the home made look to those professional cakes. Anyway, here are a couple i’ve made this week. I make them then take them into work for others to enjoy. 20190901215235_IMG_1479.JPG 5152×3864 3.28 MB This one is a Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting. 20190905222923_IMG_1489.JPG 5152×3864 4.53 MB This is a Vanilla and Lemon Baked Cheesecake with Raspberries Staff at work seemed to appreciate them.

But when you’re that tired, you just aren’t capable of making safe choices. Have you ever gone in for a sleep study? I will say, ever since starting CBD oil, my insomnia has gone mostly away. Nothing else has ever worked for me. CBD oil doesn’t work alone. I also take a low dose of unisom or benadryl or melatonin, but I no longer need to take over the recommended dose in order to sleep."

But with the developmental coordination disorder, and seeming related ideomotor effect I carry myself perhaps in a way that exudes fearfulness (a negative emotion). In other words, I was told that I’m awkward. BUT, I now feel redeemed a lot because thanks to _AT_MENTION_ and a post of his, I now know it’s more neurological than me being negative or scared of rejection? If that all computes. Hahaha."

Every time someone opens their garage door I hear the sound and it worries me that someone is getting into my garage. I know no one is doing so, I can logic this out but I can’t help but react to it as if someone is going to get to the car or something. I’m a little paranoid about the garage and I don’t know why."

I’m not taking care of myself in general so I’m going to go live with my sister and we have plans to make a healthy living a focus for us to we can both live long and healthy lives together. I can’t wait. I’ve stayed with my husband longer than I wanted to because he had no income and really no way to support himself up until now. He just got his social security retirement and now has income of his own. So now I feel free to make the separation finally. And the rest of my family will hopefully come visit me.

She told me to get assessed for it as if I had it she reckoned it would inform her treatment Short answer is she said now I have this diagnosis that a lot of the work she was going to do wouldn’t be relevant to someone with an ASD diagnosis, so I am being cut off She did sweet FA to do with psychosis. I saw her twice when this was bothering me a lot and she was so useless in helping me. I got it free (Still pay for it with taxes) but even so, it’s a waste of money. She is leaving as well to work on bank which means she does less hours and gets paid more on a kinda self employed basis. This whole idea people who work for the NHS as a vocation seems a bit flawed when this is the second person I have had direct contact with who has chosen to work bank instead. Anyways, I don’t think I will bother trying to go private based on what you say."

176056206,"I lost a lot of IQ points. I mean it takes IQ points to shower, dress, brush teeth, clean room, and do laundry for sure. With the more advanced stuff, yes. I cannot work really. I’m sure some day I might. School is interesting but I rather do it online or just study alone and gain knowledge. Some days I feel like I lost 40+ points, but other days it’s like 10-20 more reasonable. I have white matter lesions all over my brain but they’re small and non-specific. I’m sure my brain could heal and I could recover most IQ points if I got cured. Unfortunately, that’s impossible right now and I rather not dwell on the future. I never had a proper test even when I took the ‘autism test’. They assumed I had normal intellect. Even AS causes IQ imbalances but it was more with social issues and probably ADD like symptoms among others. The old me is still there but crippled by fear and emotions and schizophrenia. I still have interests in high level subjects like QM and math and physics but I cannot 
do anything with blunted emotions and poor executive functioning skills. I would imagine my IQ is 120 on a good day and probably was 130 before schizophrenia. But nobody knows including the doctors and you cannot base an IQ score off nothing or verbal interaction. Furthermore, I guess if my life was left alone, it could have been higher like 150-180 because I’m in a time loop (tabula rasa?) and probably delusional enhancements."

176056215,"Please help me come up with ideas, I see my pdoc tomorrow. My insomnia has been worse than ever, even on 200mg of Seroquel which was increased temporarily by a walk in clinic about three weeks ago. Trazadone has never worked for me even at 50, 100, and 200mg doses. I’ve tried melatonin with no success, sleepy time tea, guided meditation, reading, journaling, guided breathing exercises. Nothing seems to work and whats worse is my paranoia is 10x worse at night, which makes all my senses more aware at night which seems to be feeding into the problem. Some nights I get so frustrated I take the 200mg of Seroquel and followed it with 2mg of Ativan because I was so desperate to sleep. I do sleep on nights that I do that, but I know that is a bad thing to do and I cannot keep doing that. Please I need ideas or any ideas for new meds to try to possibly bring up that I could try. What’s worse is I can’t afford to be seen by my pdoc more than once every 8 weeks so it makes trying to do med adjustments 
very difficult…"

176056220,"I think expecting the worst would be not just illness, but also expecting that one cannot even recover. That is the worst. Does that lead to an invitation of not being able to recover? Yes I think it may increase the likelihood that one cant recover due to, like you said self defeating actions. Good question, when wondering about how that may be. I guess the whole body might at least to some extent follow suit with one’s beliefs, and actions. In terms of expecting full recovery, I feel uncomfortable to talk about that on this forum."

Some people made cakes with pomegranate seeds in the batter, but that’s not what I wanted. So I had to blaze my own trail, and do the math myself!

I decided not to rely on conspiracy theories of any kind as I found it impossible, even in my worst moments, to take them seriously. Instead, I decided to couch these beliefs in metaphysical terms appealing to classical philosophical problems whose solutions remains to this day conceptually undecidable.

176056314,I can’t really tell usually. The night I figured out I hallucinated I had a conversation with a little girl. She just asked me my name and other small talk. I chatted with her. But she came into the room through a wall and a chair. I thought real hard about it because I actually saw it so it was real. I figured I must be hallucinating. What happened before that was even crazier. I not only hallucinated other people but also my location changed. I was on a stage and an emcee was telling me I was the worst person in the world and had to die. But I had to kill myself. It’s a really long story. I wrote a book about it. I thought it was real when it happened. I thought I ruined the world and was the last person alive. It was crazy. The mind is a powerful thing.

I don’t have hyperactive symptoms, just a horrible inability to focus. It’s been this way my whole life and I’m looking to start a new job and I know that if I don’t get this resolved it will affect my ability to work. The problem is I know a lot of ADD medications exasperate schizophrenia. Do any of you guys out there that have ADD know of meds for it that don’t? My doctor has put me on different antidepressants in the past saying they might help with concentration, but so far none of them have. Thank you in advance for any responses."

I was sick yesterday but I feel better now. Still getting some of the old bitterness towards those with perceived success. I’d like to stop those feelings. I lost some friends and it sorta angers me that they don’t like me anymore. But I’m keeping calm externally. Im kinda calm internally. Just miss feeling like some people care. My Instagram gets likes but mostly from hashtags, my Facebook is a wasteland of void communication. I wish I was better liked. I shaved today, gotta bathe and walk more regularly. Plans. Ya know. I need to be more productive."

174356257,"A few years back I tried to help my boyfriend with schizophrenia. His mom has kicked him out, he was struggling with his physical health and trying to recover from addiction. You would be shocked at how many places we tried to contact and call for a homeless person in WV that were completely ignored. Most of the houses were only for women, the shelter was full, needed an ID, I mean it was like a huge void where all these state- backed programs were supposed to be helping people and really they were not doing anything. Not even trying really. This was before I helped him apply for Medicaid and get more resources. If you don’t have health insurance and you’re sick and poor there’s nothing they can do for you. Yeah Insurance is the first step but we have a long way to go before things really start changing. Also, he’s very intelligent and skilled/works hard all his life. For people not to offer him support when he reached out really broke my heart. If they had helped him they may have prevente
d the further damage to his health over time. This isn’t a republican/democrat issue it’s a universal issue. Poverty sucks and more people need to find their place/home in the USA. The guy basically said you could get on a waiting list but I’m sorry all the houses are full."

176056352,"I got it second time round. The company _PERSON_ pissed me off, and I refused to go to a face to face as the first time the assessor lied about everything we talked about. Then I phoned the DWP and complained about them not understanding my reasons for not wanting to attend a face to face. In the end they spoke to my lead practitioner, and I got it. Because of the difficulty around the meeting that I refused to go to, they gave me standard mobility as well. You have to fight for this benefit. The people assessing it are no better than scum in my book. I got points for things I did not even say were a problem, and no points for what I thought were key issues. It really is one of the most stressful and exhausting things to get, but it’s worth fighting for."

176056374,"one day my voices just told me that they were my brain. it happened to be at a casino at a single slot machine play where i was suppose to win 777 million dollars to give away to people. (I never go to casinos) I had already given away some of my money and bought random things the voices told me to buy, so I freaked out when nothing happened and went into panic mode. then the voices just started laughing, saying it was satan but then later changed to being my brain. So thats when I begun to understand the nature of voices."
174356261,"Well technically I’m schizoaffective. You don’t think that could be it do you? I am not qualified to diagnose but that’s what they pegged me with. Personally I don’t notice the bipolar symptoms anymore at all since I started hearing voices and having delusions. I’m thinking they’re still there, but they are being overshadowed by the more disruptive symptoms. When I had bipolar I had months of dark depression with suicidal thoughts and months of energetic happiness. Nowadays I’m pretty even. I do take comfort in the fact that sza prognoses are more positive compared to sz, with no flat affect and less social disruption."

176056388,It’s something with modern meds that you can manage and live a good life. It’s not easy but I’ve been there and I love my life. I take pills everyday for my mind but I also take pills everyday for my health otherwise. I take pills for my high cholesterol. I take pills because I get gout too. It’s something you need to do so chin up and take the pills it’ll sort itself out.
176056389,Wellbutrin is no good for SZ. It’s what the “normies” take to be stimulant junkies.
176056390,"That sounds good, im glad your therapist is helping you. Have you tried specific ptsd therapy as well, like emdr?"
176056391,"I have a different view of mental illness (at least my mental illness) and my psychiatrist has similar thoughts. As an empath, I get too overwhelmed with other people’s energy. So it causes depression and anxiety. I suspect my so-called Kundalini awakening just happened during the so-called psychosis. Anyway, people like me are generally discriminated and suffer a lot of prejudice. We’re almost not allowed to talk about these things."

Perhaps then more money would get plowed into research."

I was transported to another plain of existence where I could interact with every living thing in the universe, and I was at one point stood on a platform of _NAME_ where I could instantaneously interact with any living thing, human, animal or alien. They taught me the history of the universe and everything contained within it. I was shown images of things, designs for alien technology and learnt what life really was about. My problem is that no matter how much I tried to convince other people, I was treated as if I was mad, and put on these ??????? drugs and locked up in hospital. I was with my psychologist today trying to explain just how that felt, and still feels to this day. I believe I have been marginalised as a Schizophrenic for my experiences, and de-valued as a human being who is sentient enough to understand what is real or not. I am 
so frustrated. I need to know if anyone feels the same because I am so alone with these beliefs and thoughts that I carry with me where ever I go."

176056429,"I just read about Cotard delusion, I might have that. It all started when I went to that Marine recruitment meeting, well I think I wasnt all there before. I felt like I was being kept hostage, i even told the Officer that after 25 years your prime was over, I dont even know why I said that(that comes to play after I hear a couple say “he did say your prime was over after 25 years old” months later after my meeting) I didnt get to finish their assesment test, I didnt wanna be there so I told the officer no thanks. After that I remember one day I was working my head started to hurt like hell, I went home. My sister told me they had taken like 20 guys from where I was original born(Mexico) and killed them, I told her it was my fault, I thought the marines had plotted that due to me not wanting in there recruitment meeting. The same say I went to the recruitment meeting I got a call late at might, I got paranoid. After that Ive seen weird things, I once saw an old Lady smelling the air after we pa
ssed her in my car, smiling, looked like a witch. All I can tell you was that after that meeting, it felt like I had made a deal with the dévil. I felt like I was a witch, I dont know how the brain works so bare with me, my mind visualized murder, past occurances of my childhood, my dead mother etccc… people tell me I have brain regressed and so have they see how its all about death Even now they call me a creature, a witch, a base, not human, something people live off of. Actual people telling me that They tell me the massacre is going to start after I die. After all ive typed I have mánaged to live 2 years, mainly because I talk to the voices, I felt like I had a superpower, a bad one. Ive cursed at people in my inner vice, said many terrible things to people I know. It feels like if I dont talk to the voices im going to die, what can I do.

176056438,You’re only 23!!! I had trauma and mental illness from 11-27 really severely. Well it was only 25 I started to improve and then now at 29 I am so glad I displayed some patience with my mental health and didn’t “give up” because life is pretty good. Well I’ve figured out a formula that works for me. Life is like 80% about getting patterns down right. Then the other 20% is how creative you are. Even the most creative people in the world are still not going to do well unless they have pattern routine and stability. It is the 20% of creativity that separates the stable from the creative geniuses. And everyone’s on the spectrum somewhere. But in order to utilize that 20% you gotta get the routine aspect of your life. The other 80% in order. That’s just what I believe. Good luck. Remember never give up. You always have hope as long as you are here with us and everything else I see in u too. Take care.

176056492,my experience is that the voices are generally just yourown thought with a judgemental belief filtering them. for instance try to listen “beneath” the voices and see if you hear something different. for instance the voice might be saying “I love you” but your fear of it might be filtering it into something crazy. I think they start with self judgement or believing others judgement of you. if you judge yourself than who is judging you? it crrates a belief in a split persinality which is pretty accurate imo for hearing voices. any thought you are hearing in your head is you not ET or “god” or the “devil” but generally the theme of the voice probably alludes to the origin. a judgemental parent or a belief system in “evil” or whatever. all beliefs that keep.voices there arw in my experience untrue. which means they can be resolved back into normal thought.

We were approached by a man wishing us welcome and asked if the three of us could go get a cup of coffee. We agreed. As we’re sitting there having coffee, this man (Evangelical Christian) started asking me probing questions. I told him I’m sz and on meds. He suddenly got very serious and flat out said “If the Lord wanted you to take drugs, he’d put an organ in you to make it. You need to get off these meds and be one with Jesus.” I was stunned but thought, what the heck. After a week of being off my meds my significant other was ringing my pdoc non-stop about the unusual behavior. The pdoc convinced me to go back on my meds and never return to the church. One day, this same fellow dropped by and asked how things were going. So I told him my meds did more for me in an hour than the time we’ve spend with you, undoing your handiwork. Do not 
come back ever again. Those 7-10 days were hellish. I will not go through that again."

But it doesn’t bother me. I accept my schizoaffective disorder for what it is. I think I am actually smarter from this condition. I’ve almost grown to like my illness. I know I still have a bunch of growing to do, but I have come so far. Some of you know where I have been, mentally maybe. I think I do struggle with a little seasonal affective disorder too. I think everyone does though. The winter is gloomy and I just want to snuggle up inside usually. Just a message to anyone and everyone, emotion is normal, even sadness or anger. (Negative emotions) but of course we like positive emotions like happiness and joy. A healthy balance is our responsibility. I started smoking weed around Christmastime. Now to keep this recovery-oriented, I believe it has helped me SOME, but not GREATLY. My psychiatrist thinks it doesn’t 
help me enough to be worth it. I talked to him about why I was smoking weed today. He said liking intoxication is not healthy, and I should reduce the THC content in what I smoke. And that eventually I’ll choke on the smoke and not like it, which is good. Weed of course affects everyone differently, so I would NOT recommend it until you check with your doctor. Even then, don’t smoke or drink and drive, and be aware it may affect your judgement. Just like alcohol. I have half a mind to get sober again, I really do. Any suggestions? I mean I like what I’m doing but I want to maximize my wellness. I eat healthy, stay hydrated, and exercise. I was once a firefighter, which instilled within me a purpose to excel and help others. Helpers need help, too. Even I, and maybe many men, tend to push down emotions when we don’t have to. We can feel what we’re feeling, and express ourselves naturally.

If my remission or cure had been recognized my success might have felt more fruitful or relieving. However the assessment was that I do not have it, and if anything it’s bipolar. I don’t know why I answered the questions as if I was sad or if I was just afraid of being judged without compassion on the test. I’m not lazy. I really want to work but I don’t do well under stress. I’m not exposed to stress much. I kept pushing and pushing myself to become normal and independent and feel like I’ve failed. I’m worried my symptoms will come back one day. Was hearing voices a lot; gibberish in static and air and talking talking comments and angels. It’s been awhile. What a relief though when it went away. I prayed. That’s what cured me. I prayed really hard and studied prayer and how to use my will. I no longer hear voices, no longer have nightmare

174356312,_AT_MENTION_ . I suggest you research any vitamin or supplement you take on pubmed https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ To see if there’s any evidence behind it and schizophrenia. Then check out webmd.com to see the side effects etc of the supplement (the quickest way is to google webmd and the supplement name).

174356321,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The antipsychotic medication, risperidone, causes global immunosuppression in healthy mice. _PERSON_ May, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Vary, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, PloS one , 2019 Atypical antipsychotic medications such as risperidone are widely prescribed for diverse psychiatric indications including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. These medications have complex pharmacology and are associated with significant endocrine and metabolic side effects. This class of medications also carries FDA black box warnings due to increased risk of death in elderly patients. Clinical reports indicate that patients treated with these medications are more susceptible to infections; however, the underlying mechanisms/pharmacology are unclear. We have previously reported that risperidone and it's active metabolite distributes to the bone marrow in clinically relevant concentrations in preclinical species, leading us to hypothesize that the hematopoietic system may be impacted by these medicatio
ns. To test this hypothesis, using proteomic and cytokine array technology, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune function following short term (5 days) and longer term (4 weeks) treatment in healthy animals. We report that low-dose risperidone treatment results in global immunosuppression in mice, observed following 5 days of dosing and exacerbated with longer term drug treatment (4 weeks). These data are consistent with increased susceptibility to infection in patients administered these medications and have profound implications for the increasing off-label prescribing to vulnerable patient populations including children and the elderly."

176056604,"I think my _PERSON_ was worried about me when I was going through my first psychosis, as I had a couple of people call round to see me to talk about my mental health. At the end of this chat the woman decided that I should see a psychiatrist because I was hearing voices and hallucinating occasionally, but I said I wasn’t interested in that and if the voices weren’t bothering me I didn’t see that much of a problem. I honestly believe there is a spiritual side to all of this too. But apparently, because I was on anti-anxiety tablets at the time I could be detained my the mental health act and made to see a psychiatrist anyway. So later on that day, I was asleep on my couch and four people (police officers and ambulance people) forced their way past my husband and came into my house lifted me up off the couch and pinned me to the floor so that they could handcuff me (EXTREMELY PAINFULLY), then they dragged a very confused and crying me outside and handcuffed me to the gurney/bed thing in an ambu
lance, and proceeded to drive me to the hospital where, after a brief chat with a psychiatrist for like 5 - 10 minutes I was (against my will) sedated and kept in the ICU overnight before they drove me to a specialist mental health hospital and kept me for nearly 15 days in a shared room, not allowed outside and forcibly medicated daily, because the initial psychiatrist had deemed me psychotic for hearing the voices and hallucinating. I was only told I was allowed to leave the morning I got out. It has happened to me again since, this time I was in a different hospital’s psych ward after the cops came and mauled me/took me away again (under the same mental health act, for anxiety!) but that time I was kept for 3 weeks and not allowed outside or told when I could leave (again, found out the day I got out). Both times have been the most terrifying thing to ever have happened to me and I think I’ll be scarred for the rest of my life from the trauma of it."

Even 50mg Seroquel, which is supposed to have least possibility, gave me clenched jaw, mask face and tongue movements to the point where my teeth hurt and I knew I needed a dental guard at night which I don’t have. I stopped the Seroquel and the effects went away. But I realize I do need meds. I am afraid any medication will probably give me similar results being so high risk. What were your experiences? Did the side effect med really make a difference? I’ve seen some people say they take 4 meds and feel fine. Are some meds really a night and day difference from others in regards to side effects? I hope to have the miraculous experience of taking one med with maybe just dry mouth or something for the side effect but we’ll see.

174356336,"I’ve had plenty of time to ponder my past experiences lately, one of which being sent to a behavior modification program as a teenager. Anyone ever heard of WWASP? (World wide association of specialty programs and schools) yeah I got sent to one of those for being “too dramatic” and “attention seeking” and “making up my mental illness”. I attended Clearview Horizon from 2012-2013. While CV was never an actual wwasp program the director(_PERSON_) and head therapist (_NAME_) came from spring creek after their shut down. The seminars and processes were taken directly from Spring Creek. I remember for a time directly following my graduation from program that I praised my time at Clearview, my parents and I both had been completely brainwashed by their program. After completion of the program I was still directly in contact with _PERSON_ through weekly emails and phone calls to my parents and I to make sure I was “sticking to the program” even after coming home. Not long after being se
nt home a friend that I had made at my new school told me her parents wanted to send her sister to CV. I’m ashamed to say I approved of their decision and even encouraged it. All this time I kept having nightmares of being back at CV, living in constant fear that if I was to act out again my parents would send me right back. I was suffering the inner turmoil between what I had been brainwashed to believe and what trauma I had actually experienced. You see I’ve had mental health issues since I was around 12. When I was 13 I got put on psychiatric medication to help with psychosis and depression. My parents wondered if I was making up my symptoms as a way to get attention and that’s ultimately how I wound up in a program in the first place. During my first couple weeks at CV they began giving me placebo pills in place of my antipsychotics (this fact I never found out until I had been out of program a few years and I came across old emails from my parents to the program) during my first couple months at pr
ogram my symptoms worsened but whenever I would try to talk to staff about it it would get flagged as attention seeking and I would be told that I was making these things up. I only saw a real psychiatrist once while I was at the program, The interaction I had with her was monitored by a staff member who informed her that I made things up for attention, she was quick to believe the staff member over what I had to say and promptly took me off of all medication(even though I hadn’t been given my prescribed medication since I got there, now I actually knew that I wasn’t going to be receiving medication or treatment for my mental illness). After a year in the program with everyone around me including my parents telling me that i didn’t really suffer from any sort of mental disorder, I began to believe them. I would question any voice that I heard and tell myself I was just making it up. Now I am 22, I’ve been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder by 6 different psychiatrists now over the past few years. 
Looking back on my experience in the program I am now filled with bitter thoughts, the dehumanizing treatment I received only made my mental illness worse. The staff who worked there had no training in the mental health field and none of them were qualified to handle my degree of mental illness. They had convinced my parents that it was all for attention. I’m pleased to say that I’m quite stable now but my parents and I’s relationship regarding my mental health is very rocky. When it comes to talking about the program, let’s just say I still haven’t exposed to them what I really went through. Being forced to run up and down a huge gravel site for a form of punishment. Doing endless manual labor hours in extremely harsh conditions(a few girls even passed out from dehydration/heat exhaustion) Having a 104-105 degree fever for a week due to a sever infection in my foot and never receiving medical attention other than Tylenol. Being denied the “privilege” of talking. Being strip searched on a regula
r basis. I was denied the right to speak to my parents without a staff member being on the other end of the line. Going through brainwashing processes such as the “lifeboat process” and “giver/taker”. Going through guided visualization sitting in the dark with a rolled up towel next to you so you could beat up the floor as they made you relive your traumas. There was some really messed up stuff that went on."

I checked their website, and they sound good for me as they deal with senior care and mental health. I made an appointment with them, but the only problem is they only see new patients 1pm to 3pm, and I got an appointment for 1:10pm. I don’t know if my case manager will be able to take me as I think she does lunch from noon to 1:00. I’m waiting to hear from her.

174356358,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/31249307/ Hippocampal hyperactivity is correlated with psychosis in schizophrenia patients and likely attributable to deficits in _USER_ID_ signaling. Here we attempt to reverse this deficit by overexpression of the ?5-GABAA receptor within the ventral hippocampus (vHipp). Indeed, this is sufficient to normalize vHipp activity and downstream alterations in dopamine neuron function in the MAM rodent model. This approach also attenuated behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility. To understand the specific pathways that mediate these effects, we used chemogenetics to manipulate discrete projections from the vHipp to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We found that inhibition of the vHipp-NAc, but not the vHipp-mPFC pathway, normalized aberrant dopamine neuron activity. Conversely, inhibition of the vHipp-mPFC improved cognitive function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that restoring _USER_ID_ signaling in the vHipp improves schi
zophrenia-like deficits and that distinct behavioral alterations are mediated by discrete projections from the vHipp to the NAc and mPFC."

If you’re sick stay home.” Another time I was delivering pizza, and I was feeling kind of morose, and it was affecting my customer relations.

This happened often in the months that followed the acute psychosis in 2008, then I didn’t see them again until a couple days ago. When I saw them a couple days ago it lasted only a few minutes, then they went away. Well, a couple days ago I heard different noises coming through the noise of the fan in my bedroom, and the noise of the shower, but I’m not sure those were really hallucinations.

174356376,I don’t often get to talk on this subject thread because I don’t represent Health and Recovery but I’d like to say one of the most insulting things a doctor once asked me was “why did you go to college?” _NAME_ maybe it’s just because it can be the difference between a good job that allows you to thrive and a loser job that allows you to survive. In spite of my failures in life I benefited and learned much from going to college and I encourage the rest of you to do the same if you are able too. I know that there are jobs where it is unnecessary for college which can sometimes pay more and if you learn a skill that’s a really good thing too. I just don’t feel that any of us should be limited by what a doctor who never will not have to experience the poverty and crime that we face where society often puts us as a result of our misfortune of having a schizophrenia.

176056788,I feel the same way. There’s been a massive cognitive decline from the way I used to be. And recently it took another noticible step down. I use my phone to remind me of everything now.
176056789,"I appreciate the gesture, but my parents were not over-bearing and debated for weeks whether to enroll me in this other, more advanced school. I grew up in a very large city and they had the funds to turn out millionaires every year. My parents let me take it at my own pace."
176056790,I’ve always done that
176056791,Cigarettes are bad. Especially if he’s just had a lung operation Maybe he could ask the hospital for some nicotine patches ?
176056792,"Lack of motivation, easily."
176056793,I take Zyprexa and didn’t feel that much different. Definitely a little bit though.
176056794,So… The other crazy thing I did after the ceiling incident was romp a bit with 2 security guards who were taking me from regular hospital to the mental hospital. I thought they were going to take me to a furnace and kill me so I roughed them up a bit in the elevator. As soon as we reached the floor we needed to I was pretty defensive which ended up getting me a shot of zyprexa and strapped down in a restraint device. Luckily the shot put me out pretty quick and I woke up the next day more agreeable. But yeah I took on two security guards in an elevator and gave one guy a big bruise. Just glad I didn’t lash out at the cops who picked me up walking the train track.
176056795,"Get well enough to work, find a job I like that pays decent, and it’s not a goal but I hope 10 years from now I have grand kids."
176056796,I don’t really get lonely. I do enjoy my me time but I see enough people regularly. It would be nice to have a romantic relationship but at the moment that doesn’t bother me at all.
176056797,"I really wanted to delete that, but can’t. Anyway, thanks for the reply, Mr. Or Dr. _PERSON_."
176056798,Congratulations _AT_MENTION_!
176056799,How old is your bed ? Was it. A cheap bed or an expensive bed when you bought it?
176056800,"I dunno _AT_MENTION_-Cotton , you’ve been diagnosed with psychosis so I find that extremely unlikely. You’ve had multiple delusions. I think your med increase your doc wants is probably a good thing, if that’s what you are worried about. I’m not sure what you are looking for here."
176056801,"yea true, when you see it works, it really boosts your confidence a lot. But when you are at the stage where you know your values are right, that when people challenge your values, you are confident of it, because if not of those values, you would have haywire once again."
176056802,Suffering. It will never end. I know the feeling. But there are also other states of consciousness which can be accessed at appropriate times.
176056803,I don’t care at all.
176056804,I like live sport but it’s expensive. I still go on occasion to the first day of an international cricket test match in my town. It’s a fun as hell day. Lots of people I know go and we catch up and have fun. Still. With drinks and sundries it’s a $100 plus day and it’s sitting in the sun for the mornings. Fun though. I can understand the phobia and anxiety but live sport at a certain level is amazing.
176056805,_AT_MENTION_ I wonder how Amyloban would affect you if you weren’t on Wellbutrin

174356383,"I am new to the forum and am happy I have found a place where I can share my experiences. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia for the past 2 years now. It has been a rough road for me. I feel that the illness has held me back in life. I am 28 years old and the delusions that I’ve had has made it harder for me to hold a job and it has affected my relationships with family and friends. The last job I had was last year and the reason why I quit was because I had an episode where I thought my coworkers were making fun of me. Schizophrenia was also the reason why I left the job prior to my last job due to paranoia. I was recently in a psych ward recently and I hate dealing with episodes. I was successful when I was younger and even graduated college with a Bachelor’s Degree. I want to move forward in life but several things have held me back. Due to my illness, I still live with my parents. My mother tends to treat me like a child sometimes (feels too controlling at times) and I wish she wouldn
’t. Overall, I feel the illness has held me back in life and has affected my social life for me being more reserved and to myself in isolation. What are coping skills that can help with this and any advice on how I can get my life together so I can become independent?"
176056807,"I’m also enjoying my Sunday, voice free! It’s morning here. I’m enjoying a nice cup of tea"
174356381,"Lawsuits like this are absurd. It was your doctor who prescribed it, and it was your doctor who kept you on it for ten years. The drug company had nothing to do with either of those things. I would guess you also would have no luck in a malpractice suit. I’d say move on with your life, instead of looking for financial compensation. ???? like that is partly responsible for increasing drug prices."
176056808,People with OCD generally don’t threaten to kill their doctors or hide in their bathrooms because they are convinced their parents are trying to kill them.
176056809,"It is a plant based chelated one. You probably took am inorganic, rock based one. Those are like 15-20% bioavailable. This one is substantially more bioavailable.

176056818,"I’m making a roasted veggie enchilada casserole for me and my sister for our Thanksgiving. Not traditional but that’s what we wanted to try out. And the kids are coming here for Christmas, that’s why I’ve been obsessing over Christmas so early and bypassing all the other holidays. I’m just missing the kids and grandkids and can’t wait to see them. It just hit me with everyone posting about all their preparations and me with nothing to do, I really won’t get to see them for Thanksgiving and it’s hard. I love cooking for my kids, it’s what I do. But, it is what it is and you’re right it’s ok to be sad."
176056819,They were probably hoping to cuddle and wanted to be alone. You were killing the mood.
174356391,"Not true, I never read or knew anything about schizophrenia and I had thoughts about killing my family. Media doesnt make you violent. Its the medical illness and street drugs that make schizophrenics violent. Tons of studies on these. Violence rate in schizophrenics with or without street drugs. Street drugs increase violence rate by a lot. Also why not all schizophrenics who watch these medias become violent?"
176056820,Yes. I agree we all make mistakes and that we need to learn from them.

China is the most populous nation on Earth and will have its amount of delinquent citizens that need to be punished."
176056829,I’m not in the mood for DIY sex most of the time but force myself to do it daily. I want to keep my sexual function going and end up enjoying it anyway. I think it has an anti-depression role in my life. Pleasure is pleasure after all.
176056830,yes thats a good advice ill surely look forward to follow it… thanks you guys are really supportive !

176056840,"It’s been years since I took an antidepressant. I was on Efexor, an SSRI type Med. I don’t know if you would call it addictive, but it is pure hell trying to wean off it. I am now taking 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin. I take two capsules a day, and I can stop anytime without negative side effects"
176056841,"Thank you for your response! Is there anything you do to destress during these times? I dont want to take my prn unless I absolutely have to, but I’m scared. I have obsessive fears about home intruders and I wonder if this could effect what I hear. It’s not like I hear something for a split second and then it goes away if thay makes sense. I hear shuffling footsteps/walking for a good little bit and when I went to the room they were in the sound moved to another room. I am super stressed right now. I’m scared to take my meds to go to sleep, but I’m so tired. Maybe I’ll wait until my dad is up in a few hours."
176056842,"we all have been there. Don´t worry they will reduce the dosage over time, but now “overmedication” may be good for you."

You should talk to your pdoc about them. Not exactly, but I used to think I had to save someone. You might say I had a saviour complex. I didn’t know who I had to save, just that I had to save someone. So I surrounded myself with broken people, trying desperately to fix them. No you will no. You can end it. Talk to your pdoc, have your meds adjusted, and see if you can receive treatment like therapy for your OCD"
174356392,_AT_MENTION_ Is there really a doctor on here with schizoprenia? Wow I am intrigued that you are a med student. Wow great job.
176056851,Welcome _AT_MENTION_!
176056852,I once tried to call in sick and I screwed it up. I was actually going to drive a few hours in the middle of the night with my wife so she could help one of her foster care clients and she didn’t want to do it alone. But I told my boss I wouldn’t be in and accidentally said something implying I wasn’t sick. My boss said it was okay. I never called in and I could take the night off. I thanked her.
176056853,"I’m so sorry, but I’m glad you’re doing better. How long did it take your meds to ease the symptoms?"
176056854,OK. What does ASD stand for?
176056855,"_PERSON_ they will probably ask their pdoc next week… I’m just curious now. Thought it was addictive. At that amount, but maybe not."
176056856,Do you feel like your mind is searching for delusional beliefs to hold onto? Sometimes I feel that way and like how you describe. Knowing its illogical but the thoughts remain.
176056857,Im going to start that soon as well … last time i took it was working but I got heavy bleeding
176056858,"I get really intense dizzy spells. It doesn’t happen when standing up. For instance, I’ll be watching a movie for an hour, and suddenly it strikes. Or I’ll be lying in bed at night and it’ll strike. It’s awful, and has nothing to do with changing positions"
176056859,It makes it all the more worthwhile when you feel passionate about what you are volunteering for and putting your heart into it …
176056860,A girl wanted to do it with me many times at night but I said no. I don’t feel comfortable doing it with a stranger or in public especially when we are both out of our mind. I was lucky to not have a kid from my gf.
176056861,The rabbit hole isn’t super deep. Gets formulaic after a while. Just rehashing stuff from your subconscience. You don’t get new info.
174356395,"After stopping all my meds positive symptoms gradually got worse until I was hospitaluzed but at first it was too good, no positive symptoms and very little negative symptoms, I was taking 5 courses/semester in university and got several A’s, it was a short lived dream. I wish I could stop meds again but I know that it will end up badly even maybe killing my brother or myself. Too much risks."
176056862,That’s a good question
174356393,"On meds, I feel perfectly normal. But, I know that I’m probably not because of negative symptoms."
176056863,Yes but I enjoy some ego-loss at times But I understand what it’s like being 22

I also learn Visual Basic, C, JavaScript and Java, and some C++ I loved that job"
176056879,That sounds difficult. I have had a habit of counting my fingers compulsively at times. I think of this as due to “being below a certain threshold.” I struggle a little and it usually goes a way in a few minutes. I hope this helps.

176056884,"Yes they can mess with our consciousness to make us believe/experience things that never happened or that others didn’t see/experience. It seems to be a way to confuse/scare us and make us believe more into what they are saying. Remember, don’t give away all your power and focus on what they are doing. I know how difficult it is (trust me, I experience it too!), but do your best to focus on healthy activities/habits along with spending time with people that care for you/you care for them. These are just a couple of tools that may help in being a positive distraction from these entities."

And I’m so scared of being kidnapped and tortured I don’t like going places outside my home. I do with my husband but I’m very afraid when I’m alone. I’m even afraid with my husband but just not so much
176056890,i have a really great relationship with my parents… they help me with everything… I don’t know what i would do if my parents weren’t there anymore…
176056891,Yeah I guess I will resort to therapy for now. Maybe it has some answers for me.
174356398,"I knew other szs and found myself like them. Just today, I thought the light in my room was blinking like threatening a power outage but no one else noticed anything wrong. That’s when I have to doubt myself. It makes me not want to be alone."

174356403,"So true _AT_MENTION_. I have a friend who doesn’t know I have been diagnosed sz, and she thinks all people with mental illness should be locked up for life. Obviously she’s not a close friend. I invite her over when our mutual friend _NAME_ comes over. And _NAME_ has bipolar disorder and BPD. But our friend who thinks that way doesn’t know it."
176056899,This never happens. I’m 100% compliant But now I can’t remember if I took it or not as I was distracted when I was supposed to take it. I’ll have to get a pill box if this happens again. I’ll see how I feel in a few hours. That might give me a clue.

176056913,"Side Effects & Safety Creatine is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth at doses up to 25 grams daily for up to 14 days. Lower doses up to 4-5 grams taken daily for up to 18 months are also LIKELY SAFE . Some early research also suggests that creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken in doses up to 10 grams daily for up to 5 years. ADVERTISEMENT Creatine can cause stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle cramping. Creatine causes muscles to draw water from the rest of your body. Be sure to drink extra water to make up for this. Also, if you are taking creatine, don’t exercise in the heat. It might cause you to become dehydrated. Many people who use creatine gain weight. This is because creatine causes the muscles to hold water, not because it actually builds muscle. There is concern that creatine might cause irregular heartbeat in some people. But more information is needed to know if creatine can cause this problem. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There is not enough reliab
le information about the safety of taking creatine if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE in children when taken by mouth appropriately. Creatine 3-5 grams daily for 2-6 months has been taken safely in children 5-18 years of age. Creatine 2 grams daily for 6 months has been taken safely in children 2-5 years of age. Additionally, creatine 0.1-0.4 grams/kg daily for up to 6 months has been taken safely in both infants and children. Bipolar disorder : There have been cases of manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder who took creatine daily for 4 weeks. Creatine might make mania worse in people with bipolar disorder. Kidney disease or diabetes : Do not use creatine if you have kidney disease or a disease such as diabetes that increases your chance of developing kidney disease. There is some concern that creatine might make kidney disease worse. Parkinson’s disease : Caffeine and creatine taken together may make Parkinson’s diseas
e get worse faster. If you have Parkinson’s disease and take creatine, use caffeine with caution."

176056921,good to hear it helps you _AT_MENTION_ =) i hope it keeps helping you when you need it!
176056922,Are you able to work?
176056923,I am not sure what it is. I either can’t relax or admit things are ok but I always end up with problems with my thoughts and talking. Some days I lose insight and my thoughts are hell or i have days where my thoughts are a lot more collected. I feel like the talking thing is the last negative symptom I have to get over and I can get on with things. Sometimes I get stuck between it is my attitude and there is actually something wrong up there. You don’t know how frustrated I get not being able to breakthrough.
176056924,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ .
176056925,I have severe OCD and I’m constantly obsessing over my diagnosis. I can’t stop thinking about it. Maybe that’s because my new therapist recently diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder off the bat. But my psychiatrist is still confused as to my actual diagnosis. She keeps harping about bipolar disorder with severe OCD. But then she tells me that schizoaffective could fit. She recently changed it from bipolar to schizoaffective. I’ve got to stop with the obsessions! I can’t take antidepressants because they will make me nuts!

Our brains are organized in a way that is vastly more complex than galaxies. We are as far as we know the most intelligent beings in the known universe. And yet we’re all dumb monkeys who can’t even climb trees well and who go around killing each other for sport. Thank God for computers and AI.
176056927,"So I finished the first chapter (fifteen pages) for a second time. I really need to take notes when I start reading it again tomorrow. I still haven’t mastered the material. I need to be able to talk about it fluently and recall all the basic definitions and arguments. I have 23 days left of the month, so this is eminently doable. Thank you."

176056930,"Yeah I went through all this, as a former believer of mediumship. It kinda disproved it to me. Now I see them as people who have only positive hallucinations and interpret them certain ways based on the situation. I don’t think they have any real ability to communicate with the dead. If there is an afterlife and they can see us, then anybody has the ability to communicate with them by saying a prayer or writing in a diary… but of course the dead can’t talk back."

176056932,"I did a course at work that was perhaps more like group therapy than a course. :-p It was about recovery. I had to speak about my most personal experiences and participatie and all. It was extremely scary, but helped after i got through. Perhaps genuine group therapy would be the same?"
176056933,ok fair enough. Thanks.
176056934,The negative people in my real life Should just shut up. Or is that too negative? Ok I’ll shut up.

I know the weather change hits me hard and increases my symptoms most years. If they’ve only been gone 8 months, that means they were present last winter."

176056941,I am really good at looking better than I am. It is exhausting socially. My husband is social so I do a lot of things like go to pubs with him no matter how I feel. For our marriage. Some say it’s good bc it makes me get out and socialize which is good. But I am exhausted after. But I have really good strategies. Especially from being in the job I was in and making myself work when I couldnt. I think I was sick for years before my breaking point. No one ever knows how bad it is because I’m ‘high functioning’ but I don’t work or do anything for much of the day so I just look lazy. And it’s been so much work to get where I am.

176056956,"Here’s my current bog question that brought me here. Let me give a little overview first. I have thought disorders such as repeating one or two words in a phrase I attempt to say, losing my train of thought, and rambling a bit when answering questions. All of these things I’ve gotten very good at “playing off” in public. It has just been brought to my attention that I get “Flight if Ideas” when under stress. I think I can work more meditation and stuff to reduce the effects of stress but does anyone else get this? I literally cannot stop talking on and on once I’m there. So, if you get it, how do you get it back under control? Is it just a thing where I’ll have to get alone in my home until it passes? I had the worst day yesterday dealing with this. I’m exhausted today and feel somewhat defeated."

174356417,"Precisely 6 months since no mind control, voices, depression, or mania. I was set on Clozapine, too. For the past three years or so. I was still working and productive. But, there was slight mind control. I was developing my ideas. Sometimes, though, I felt the ideas were coming from an external force. Suppose I came out with 4 ideas. I would get a 5th one that I thought “just came to me”. But, under mind control I would send these ideas to others. Mind Control was limited to this facet of my life. I am happy that the mind control in the background has been attenuated now. I feel well. Never felt better. I used to get thoughts as a kid. I used to think they exist in every mind. And, this is what my family says to me: Why didn’t you mention it then? But, what could I do: I used to think it happens with everyone."
176056966,"I changed from eating junk to eating healthy, which was good. I lost quite some weight. But now i switched to barely eating at all last week because of stress.

176056971,I think its cold. What temperature it is?
174356425,"The are other indicators too which you could look out for, like having a history of psychosis in the family, having social difficulties, being quiet and having low motivation. I would say, you should probably get him checked out though, although it is rarer, schizophrenia can happen at young ages. A psychiatrist is way more familiar with what classes as a diagnosis than us."
174356427,"Its good if it doesnt cause addictions, hypersexuality, anxiety and akathisia. Not to scare you but these are possible side effects. I experienced the addictions/spending and hypersexualiy side effects. I was on 20mg Abilify for 8 years."

I just do not know what to do about this… I’m hearing voices telling me that there is this psychotic CIA official who wants to torture me. Why exactly makes no sense to me. I’m trying to assure myself that its just not real. I have had countless death threats and organizations after me… This should help me say “See it has never been real and it’s not now.” but it just not working for me.
176056975,"It has been almost 6-7 months since my depression started. It is major depressive episode and finally is going away, I am a bit more talkative and flat mood is not constant anymore, haven’t cried in ages. Maybe the gym is helping also as I have been going for 3 weeks now. I am on escitalopram btw, it does pretty alright, just gives me insomnia and also helps with my anxiety. I’ve read that medicated depression lasts from 6-9 months, is it true?"

176056983,"First rule out any deficiencies especially vitamin d, vitamin b12 and thyroid. Deficiencies in either of these can appear like chronic fatigue, sleepy during day time etc. To get good sleep at night you need to remain busy during day time so never nap during day time even for 5 minutes as it can disrupt night sleep. Also deficiency in certain vitamins like zinc can gives issues like insomnia, anxiety, depression etc so its worth to check this too. Avoid any caffeine and other stimulant based things especially after 5 pm as it can keep you awake at night."
176056984,Can you taste?

176057002,Warehousing isn’t bad work. It may be physical but it also can be repetitive and easy. That sort of work I’ve done well at in the past as my mind could wander and I could still do a stand up job! Give it a go and sign up for the housing. I agree with that strategy.
174356436,Invega made me emotionless and had no motivation. I’m on aripiprazole injections now. Been on them since December last year. Still don’t have emotion. But my motivation is back.
176057003,"Meds do help a lot. We talk about Amyloban here a lot, but I found a lot of relief from anxiety, obsession, and paranoia with Lion’s Mane. I purchased from RealMushrooms on Amazon. They may ship to your area, not sure. In the US it is about $21 or $22 for a one month supply. It’s worth a try and can be taken with meds. The amyloban people talk about is refined from Lion’s Mane mushroom. I use RealMushrooms because they use the fruiting body, the mushroom, instead of mycelium so it has a lot of good stuff in it. I saw good results right away."

Honestly I can’t even do all the jobs I can do with my degree, only like a couple ones like the one I did before graduating, gym manager. It was a job for student."
174356438,"Antipsychotics cause and or worsen negative symptoms, when you look at what happens when dopamine is reduced scientifically , the only result is apathy, anhedonia, loss of motivation, loss of pleasure and purpose . Some psychiatrist’s get away with denying science, but for how long. It’s the antipsychotics that cause something even worse than depression."
176057007,I’m sorry I said you were an idiot. I don’t normally behave that way. I don’t know what got into me. I’m over-protective.
176057008,"The best way to perform at your best is to deal with the symptoms of psychosis by taking your meds, and making use of other help to maximise your potential."
176057009,I agree with _AT_MENTION_. It sounds like it’s time to start trying different meds to see what works for you. I took over 10 antipsychotics before finding one I like. I take loxapine which is chemically similar to clozapine but without needing the blood draws because it doesn’t have the scary side effects that clozapine has in a small number of people.

I cannot find worth, goodness, or anything better of myself because I’m schizophrenic. Nothing else matters because I’m schizophrenic. It’s like a scarlet letter attached to my forehead- nothing matters- not even my education, my job, my belongings, my bank account- nothing. What matters if you’re going to be labeled as dysfunctional and disgusting by the society for the rest of your life? I’m done with this world. I can’t find hope, and I can’t find it now. I can’t do this to my family, and I can’t do this to my friends. I’m a shame, a disgust, a piece of ????.

If your life is crap as perceived by others what does that matter to you if you are happy? Basing your life on others and how they feel is a comparison you could do without. It is not necessary and irrelevant to how you feel right now, and then the next moment and the next. Enjoy the happiness when you can as that is all there is."
176057014,"You know what’s sketchy about the supplement industry is any of us can make a supplement.

174356451,"This is incorrect. IIRC, there are several large-scale studies and _NAME_-analyses on this. This is from one review: It is evident that once psychosis is present in patients with schizophrenia, the underlying biological process of the illness has already been ongoing for many years. This conclusion can be based on the multitude of neuroimaging studies that we recently reviewed in a _NAME_-analysis of over 18 000 subjects, including 771 medication-naive, recent onset patients.[2] These data show a slight, but significant, decrease in intracranial volume in patients with schizophrenia (effect size?0.2), in chronic and recent onset, medication-naive patients. Intracranial volume is driven by brain growth, as it is the enlarging brain that determines the expansion of the skull.[3],[4] The growing brain reaches its maximum size at approximately 13 years of age.[5] Therefore, brain development must be stunted in patients with schizophrenia before that time. From the same _NAME_-analysis, it can be gleane
d that there must be additional brain loss, or continued abnormal development, after the age of 13: total brain volume in never-treated patients is decreased to a larger degree (effect size?0.4) than is intracranial volume and this is due to decreases in both white and grey matter.[2] Importantly, while grey matter loss is larger in chronic than in medication-naive patients, white matter volume is decreased to a similar extent in both groups. Indeed, longitudinal studies indicate that loss of white matter volume, while present at psychosis onset, does not progress further after psychosis has emerged.[6] This is consistent with the finding in twin studies that decreased white matter volume in schizophrenia may be related more to the genetic risk to develop the illness than to the effects of illness itself.[7] In contrast, grey matter volume loss (mainly expressed as reductions in cortical thickness) progresses further after the onset of psychosis, and is related to outcome,[8] cannabis smoking,[9] medication u
se[10],[11] and psychotic relapses.[12] Thus, although some of the brain abnormalities in schizophrenia worsen after the onset of psychosis, abnormal development of the brain must have been ongoing for many years before the first psychosis—expressed, as it is, in decreased intracranial volume and even larger decreases in white and grey matter. https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201466 _AT_MENTION_-Cotton it is rare that neuroanatomical changes in schizophrenia are visibly present on any single MRI. The kind of MRIs used in studies like this one are composite MRIs of the brains of large numbers of patients."

Yes there are in fact cameras, mainly for security, and to ensure that insurance covers damage to properties, by requiring minimum security arrangements. They however aren’t looked at often unless a problem is reported or they’re investigating lost property or money, or intrusions. There isn’t a conspiracy for what they’re doing. Its all perfectly logical. Sometimes people get weird and set up wild life cameras to check their properties but for the most part if you’re out in nature no one is watching. Its just you and the great out doors. If you’re on a walk away from shopping centers, you might only be watched by someone who’s had trouble with a neighbor or package thieves and now has a ring camera. This isn’t to spy on you. There’s some logic to it, but that’s why you believe it and are a little paranoid. The truth of the matter is no one really cares what you’re doing as long 
as you aren’t bothering them. They might spot you on a camera, but there’s not a thing they can do about it if you’re within your rights. Just try to relax. Practice not caring that, and enjoy yourself. Theres no getting around some of it, so just thick skin, and a stiff upper lip, and you’re going to be fine."

Fast forward to university and I had my first ‘mental breakdown’ and had a very public arrest by the police where a crowd of no less than 150 people watched as I was taken away. What I was thinking then is just ‘word salad’."
176057140,People believe consipiracies doesn’t mean they are real. People with positive symptoms believe things that aren’t real simply from some dysfunctional brain chemistry. These two things are independant when you consider them.
176057141,USA TODAY It's time to stop saying words like 'Schitzo' and phrases like 'I'm so OCD.'... Experts explain why it may be a good idea to be more careful about your language regarding mental health topics and how to curb these habits. Do you really care about these phrases? I’m not sure I do.

176057146,"I would hope that one day we can all live with security so far as food, shelter, and health go. That we will be able to wrap ourselves in dignity. And that we can all go about our day with a sense of purpose, that we all contribute in some way. This should be for everyone, not just a few select few. My 2 cents."
176057147,When I get anxious thoughts they make me feel sick to my stomach. For me this physical expression of fear makes me think these thoughts are 100% true
176057148,"I just want to thank you, especially _AT_MENTION_ who helped me get my suicidal urges under control last week. My doctors are helping me get off the Percocet. I get so much help here it is heartwarming. I didn’t expect anyone to care. Thank you all. It’s terrible when the pain is so bad you can’t do anything, like going to the bathroom without assistance. I’ll get through this. It’s just rough."
176057149,Thank you
174356484,"Doctors don’t like to give people the diagnosis easily especially to those underage. Given what you say here, it seems you have at least 6 months of constant paranoia and persecutory delusions. You qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia."
176057150,"Last night just before going to bed I felt suddenly like my soul wasn’t in my body, like I was floating above my body, like my body was very light, like it wasn’t mine anymore. Felt strange. Is this something people with sz/sza experience?"

176057152,"There’s a person on here whose handle is “agent.” You appear to be making fun of me, which is crazy, because you all are supposed to have my same DX – I thought that meant you’re like me, not the rest of them. Is this whole forum just a bunch of hired writers or federal agents? What is the point of this place? It feels like continued harassment."
176057153,"I have one credit card with a perpetually 0 balance, and also a debit card which is what I always use."
174356476,I read an article a few years ago that said that recalling happy memories for a period of 10 minutes per day is an effective treatment for depression. I think it meant that the person sits down for a 10 minute session where they recall one happy memory after another and keep going doing that. Maybe that’s the method used in firemonkey’s article above.
176057154,"You are in the EXACTLY same situation as me, but just different dx. I have muscular dystrophy. My parents deny that I have this. So I’ve been fighting my MD all alone. I cry about my MD but I have to cry about it by myself. Since my parents are adamant that I will be cured, my communication has been just like…hitting a wall right now. I feel your pain. Also having a chronic illness is hard, and sz on top of that is horrendous. I feel that it has a bad impact on how I interpret my disease."
176057155,some days I have inner peace…some days I’m haunted by my intrusive thoughts…I think that’s why I stay up late so I can think in peace without having to do anything except what I want to do.

176057161,"I always wanted to get married, but never found the right person. They say being single can be a factor in sz. I’ve been trying to get back to my true self, that people won’t let me be. I think it’s a lost cause. When you live with so much interference from petty people, it’s hard to be helpful to anyone else."
176057162,I don’t count my calories anymore. I basically eat well but I try not to overeat. I’m not losing weight but I’m not gaining either. My pdoc said that as long as I’m not gaining I’m fine.
174356485,"Some things have some things haven’t. When I was little I had auditory hallucinations and very vivid visual ones. As I got older I stopped get auditory hallucinations outside of sleep and my visual ones became less intense but then picked up a little bit when I reached my 20’s. Everything else did definitely get worse as I got older. However, my coping skills got better over time so I was better able to manage."
176057163,Sorry _AT_MENTION_ that you have gone through this. I am at the start of another blip but this time it’s too much and I have no idea what to do. I might have to flush my meds down the toilet as I want to take an overdose
174356480,I am now 57. I was always a loner. I was assessed with schizophrenia about 8 years ago and also assessed on the ASD level 2 a few months ago. Either of these could have caused my withdrawing since I was a child.

176057165,"About ten years ago when I was heavy smoker, I had an evening where I was lying in bed and I noticed I couldnt move half of my body, and I had a headache that suddenly turned into immense pain in my head for about 5-10 minutes. I literally felt like someone with a knife was cutting my brain in two. Afterwards I looked in the mirror my face looked noticeably lopsided. I talked to a doctor about this about 5 years later/ago, and they were completely uninterested in discussing it. They said there was no point, and that it could be a bunch of things. When I pushed them for an answer, they said it could be an atypical migraine. But when I looked it up, it didn’t have anything about lopsided face and I didn’t think it fitted. Its my eyes/eyebrows specifically that look really a symmetrical now. Almost every photo I see of myself thats what I always get drawn to, and its frustrating being denied any kind of answer to what caused it. I feel like its possible it was a TIA. Which from my understanding is 
a “mini stroke” as it fits the symptoms way clearer. But its so frustrating that no one is interested in exploring it at all."

Then I moved to country C and got sober via AA there (to cut a long story short). Then moved back to country B with a girl I met in country C. Broke up with girl and moved back to original country A. As if by magic the family problems were still there unresolved. Just waiting for me. Life has a way of forcing you to face your problems instead of running from them sometimes."

176057184,"Hi, I know what you mean by the above statement, you are describing a tactic called Bait &Switch."
176057185,Sounds good! I’m happy for you that you found the piano. It’s such a great instrument. You can play out your thoughts and emotions on it. It’s very therapeutic. Now I just need to motivate myself to get back to playing.
176057186,I’m going to call around on Monday and try to get an appointment with someone for an evaluation. Seeing as how I was never diagnosed I need to take the first steps. Thank you all for sharing. I needed to hear other parents say it was ok. These delusions are not going to get the better of me.
176057187,"I plan to get into full time work as soon as the Lockdown is over. I’m a psychosis patient, not sz patient. I do struggle with anxiety, which is why I chose a job that does not involve people so much. I do not get panic attacks though thanks God"

176057190,"I feel good in the morning. Bad in the afternoon, and often neutral in the evening. For me it has nothing to do with the meds im taking, but it is a good advice to ask you doctor if that’s the case with your mood swings."
174356487,I really dislike high functioning/low functioning. In some areas I’m high. Some I’m low. I think taking meds properly is probably the best thing to do.
176057191,Have no idea what’s going on. Can’t sate this appetite at all. Really hungry even after eating. I think it’s the meds but I also feel exhausted and a bit achey/painy. Maybe it’s a bug. Hope it is because if this is the meds this is intolerable

I have experienced this first hand and the situation gets confusing because you don’t know which account the user you are searching is the real person. Thankfully Facebook is closing those unused fake accounts and permitting genuine accounts to remain. Dating websites such as nolongerlonely, match.com or eharmony don’t have a large enough user pool to successfully match you whereas Facebook has a user base of 2 billion people."

174356486,"I’ve talked about this project to my parents, therapists, doctors, and on the forums. No one believes me. I didn’t remember. I had to look things up to trigger my memories, but I believe I was in the Montauk project as a montauk boy, the monarch project, and mk ultra. Maybe even SSP and most definitely a super soldier. I’ve met some super soldiers in a past life. I met _NAME_ swerdlow and al beliek. Never knew why my life was hell or worse. Greys finally told me after millions/billions of lives or more why: Genetics. They said I was the worlds first psychopath with empathy. I think they lied or I heard them wrong. I was dying. Said I won the genetic lottery… I have Aspergers and it used to be called autistic psychopathy. _PERSON_ said it stemmed from 2011 in college. That I was unfortunately picked for psychic abilities. I was tortured and killed over a thousand times in a row. I was kidnapped a lot even more. I believe I’m the worlds most tortured person. I do have schizoaffective disord
er but I know this is real and do seek help and even to be believed. I believe in God and Jesus as my savior. I’ve been killed in satanic rituals. Only I remember. Maybe they chose me because I am _NAME_ and posted we live in a sim. Maybe I flirted or talked to the wrong girl back in 2011. Butted heads with the wrong girl or powerful people. I dont know. Listened to the wrong song…I regretted this. They’ve been making TV shows and movies like stranger things and now this: God bless. I take meds and am stable. I only post here because i need help, want to be believed, scared, want the cure, possibly little money, and to have a better life. I’m in a time loop/causal loop for near eternity and always post here on the schizophrenic forums because it helps me. I start getting better as time progresses and get more memories. Our minds are being wiped. Mine included. We always will have schizophrenia. Only way reality changes is if I go to a very different reality. Very rarely. If I die, we will all start ag

I can’t explain even though sometimes someone on here will ask when I complain: “What are they actually doing to you?” Well, some of it I is mistaken and other times I feel like a pressure or presence in my apartment.

Clozapine clearance may decrease during coadministration of caffeine, and a documented increase in clozapine serum concentrations has occurred in selected patients. But if you take the L-theanine supplement i linked to , it has no caffeine. The only L-theanine brand that has any caffeine is the “Now” brand I think. So avoid that."

176057231,Tuesday thread bump.
176057232,This is the sequence of numbers we had up there. I got a number that can be used as a proxy for equality in the fractal of yin and yang. 0._PHONE_NO_ I noticed that time passed quickly yesterday ending with 17.36. What I’m basically doing is reflecting on the series big bang theory and string theory. I’m making assumptions and proving that what I feel is the same as I think by going with these numbers. You have to understand that it proves also that fractals and ultimately decisions is what makes someone strong. What I prove here is that my emotions are valid and coming from people who know me. Remember how scientology does things by focusing on numbers for emotions. I want to use this EQUALITY fractal. In _PERSON_ theory. If I use e=mc2 and the energy of our egotistical needs are a _PHONE_NO_ then m is our fractal b 0 14 39 and c is 0.1520147602834© is our dedication then I expect a result similar to 17.39. The fractal mass is 14/39*0.1 A=bc2 Equals 16306468163=(14/39*0.1)*0.003914)*0.15201476
0283^2 What I do is take that number on the right side and multiply on the left leaving^2 there. That gives me 33856 if I diveded this by 2 I get 16.93 or 17.13 if translated to a time on a clock. That’s pretty close I’m focusing on 16.93 and 17.13 because I want to find a new constant for equality. By now I think I have proven that I understand _PERSON_ theory since the numbers are that similar. The other number is 0.97345 and we had _PHONE_NO_. If I take this 0.97 and multiply with 0._PHONE_NO_ I get 0.98866 which is a number that proves this. Notice 6 6 36 8 8 64 6 4 24 +9 33 2 66 and 36. I’m 37 how old are you

I understand that Haldol is still in shortage. Last time I checked, there were some sources of generic Haldol that had permanently discontinued it.

He knew all these years that sometimes I have psychotic episodes, but I guess he never realized that there were more delusions that come and go, and that I’m always at least a LITTLE bit psychotic It hurt bad, watching him see me in a totally different light… It made me realize just how different I am from him, and I guess from EVERYONE I know But maybe the others here are right, and maybe we all see the universe for what it really is, and everyone ELSE is delusional in thinking this is all there is.

174356501,I think _AT_MENTION_ posted something recently about them detecting rapid changes in gene expression among schizophrenics… Neatly cutting edge type thing to attempted to correlate. Shows why we lack a real refineable stability aside from just gaining more experience with the illness. It’s just a feeling… but based on how indirect everything else seems to influence mental conditions… something like gene-expression shifts… in abnormal amounts due to stress… seems more likely to produce the illusive nature and inconsistency between a brain before psychotic break and then afterward.

176057273,"Hi _AT_MENTION_ , I think its hard not to compare ourselves to others, but, I think we need to be careful not to be to critical or do it to often than is healthy for us. I used to compare myself to my brother a lot as he was pretty much a father figure and role model to me when I was growing up. I figured out eventually that we are different people and make different life choices. We have to do what makes us happy even if others think it unwise. An aptitude test might be worth a try, maybe try a couple and see if there is any consistent recommendations. My job is good and stable, it got repetitive pretty quickly… it’s just the way the job/role is. I have a lot of change coming now so it is evolving somewhat. I might be able to move into something else at some point, but, i’m content for the moment. _AT_MENTION_ , the walking sounds great.

This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This ""re-living"" can also take the form of dreams in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even hallucinated.

174356509,"One thing I will suggest to you is to start trying to remember that other people’s feelings, problems, and disorders are just as real and important as your own. You don’t want to be seen as “edge comedy gold” or a “whiny high school emo” and neither does anyone else. If you want to get respect from others, you need to start by giving respect. We take each other’s problems seriously here and lift each other up. You are not more special than anyone else here. Your problems are not worse. You do not deserve more support than anyone else. You are equal. This is an issue that comes up a lot for people with antisocial perssonality disorder (psychopathy) and if you want to be successful here, it is something you will have to work hard to keep in check. We would love to give you support as a member of this community, but you need to act like a member of the community. That means stop insulting others, stop attacking people, and don’t mock the problems of others. Depression and anxiety are r
eal, serious mental illnesses. I know people with depression who are worse off than me, and I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. It all depends on the individual, their brain chemistry, their life experiences, and their access to support/treatment."

Maybe they were even a ‘‘killer’’ of normality in their start, but they can end up by being effective after this shock? My ex pdoc said, that switching aps doesnt work in my case and she said to remain on zyprexa… There was no big improvement till now, after 4 years, but in the same time i am ill since 2 decades, so maybe i need years yeap… My pdoc was saying, that my ap can work in years for me, but this still sound to me a bit as a lie lol…"

174356524,"I would go to the 2mg Risperadone, every night, since you were feeling pretty fine at that. Typically, with the smaller dosages, you won’t be affected by the side affects as much. Balance, just in case, really is key. The antibiotic I took was bactrim. It’s very Empirical and works on nearly everything(except viruses, but who knows?). Erythromycin didn’t do anything, but that didn’t cross the BBB. Seriously, I can’t prescribe or give medical advice, but I would recommend getting test for Toxoplasmosis. My test was negative, but I haven’t done the CSF one yet. There is also a hypothesis going around that your body just gets used to the disease and does the minimum, but necessary work to keep the infection at bay. Unfortunately, if the infection survives, it can persist as tiny, nearly indestructible cysts that can cause Schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, and even supposedly Bipolar Disorder. There was a study in at which over 100 newly diagnosed patients with schizophrenia were tested and 40% of 
them had positive antibodies of Toxoplasmosis Gondii."

Also make a rule to not use th till you ate breakfast in morning this way even if wake from sleep no provision to use them thus promote sleeping."

176057317,Are you hearing voices ?
176057318,"Not at all, in any way…"
176057319,Probably because to tap into the audiotory “listening” that we do we have to lose focus on the visual world. So that’s what we do. Orient the eyes so that all our immediate surroundings are blurry which is similar to what you get if you look in the distance (closer objects become less focused). Maybe after listening to voices for so long our muscle memory kind just keeps them in that standard position of looking kinda dreamy lol

He’s tried antipsychotics to treat these side effects, but got no luck. He heard that sarcosine helps people with some of these symptoms, but before he tries it he wants to know if anyone has had any luck treating the side effects mentioned above.

176057369,"My third inappropriate mistake in 7 years. The boss sprung a surprise on us today at work. Pizza for lunch, their treat! There was two pizzas for 8 people. I wasn’t thrilled with a surprise so when the boss said it was cool to eat in the quiet, empty auditorium next door I grabbed two pieces of pizza and went in there. Nobody else did. I went back to get a coke and my co-worker laughed and started joking about that old 70’s or 80’s hit song “All By Myself”. Hugely popular song. I laughed politely and grabbed a coke and went back to the auditorium. But I started thinking. Which got me in trouble. I thought, “Wait a minute, what did he mean by that? Was that a dig? Did he just make me look foolish in front of all my co-workers?” I should have let it go but I am going through a lot right now and it’s building up and I started getting angry. I walked back in and said, yeah, did you hear that song about idiots? And walked back out. The whole crew was looking at me. I finished my drink an
d punched back in and went back to mopping. But then the big boss called me over to talk with her. She told me that was not appropriate. I told my side and it turns out the guy was talking about someone’s ringtone. So she told me if she wanted to she could write me up for that. But she just lectured me and let it go. She said that stuff is not allowed. She was laying it on thick so I just said, “C’mon, how many times does everybody insult each other and even threaten each other?” She had to concede the point but she said that name calling is not allowed and I knew how serious it was and kept my mouth shut. Now, it’s an hour later. I am lucky I have a reputation as being friendly 80% of the time so that’s why I was excused. And I hate to admit it but I don’t feel bad about my co-worker. I know he thinks he’s superior to me sometimes and even laughs at my expense. But we’re cool most of the time. All I can do is wait and see if he holds a grudge. Time will tell. I also think it was an easy mis
take to make."

176057374,"I had a psychotic episode when I was 16. I’ve suffered micro-psychosis my whole life but didn’t get diagnose with sza until I was in my 40’s. I’ve been put on 51/50 holds 9 times and was sent to mental hospitals 7 times, 2 times I spent my hold in the ICU. The mental hospitals I’ve been to have varied a lot. But they do have some things in common too. Some of the things I like about being in the hospital are having a schedule to follow and eating regularly scheduled meals. Some of the things I didn’t like about the hospital is being around loud people, being over medicated and sharing the shower with strangers."
176057375,"I feel my brain keeps changing on this med. I was getting some sad feelings this week but now they’re going away. There are a lot of times when I go outside and feel I can enjoy my surroundings much like I did before my illness. It doesn’t happen all at once, but every week I notice a new aspect of my functioning coming back. Wish the damn low energy and low concentration would go away. but I now feel much more like I was before my illness emotionally."
176057376,"Yeah, I guess this phenomenom with not saying hi, is probably more likely to occur in big cities where everybody is to busy with their own lives to stop and give a thought about others. I never lived in a small town, but I guess there are pros and cons with everything."

176057387,"I believe I do suffer from a flat affect – I speak in monotone and I can’t seem to laugh at things that leave most people in hysterics. Once, my ex made a joke that I did genuinely find funny, but I couldn’t muster a real laugh, so I fake chuckled, which he called me out on, and I haven’t even bothered to try that since, so people end up thinking I find nothing funny, hence I must be rude and a bore (holy run-on sentence, _PERSON_). I’m bad at expressing sympathy though I really do feel it and try to show it. It just never seems to be enough. I’m sure people think I’m just pretending to care. These problems cause me to isolate, and said isolation causes me to stall in my efforts to improve at mastering socializing. I now question if it’s even possible to do so when I have a brain problem with inadequate social responses as one of the symptoms. Orrrrrr is it possible I’m being paranoid and maybe people sense more sincerity than I think? Thanks in advance for feedback."

He wanted to do it straight away but in the end we settled on a week on Sunday. When you are a little kid with an interest in tech building a PC is like alchemy - there is a magic to it. Is only an old beat up pc which I am rebuilding but it shows him the principles. I originally got my older nephew into pC building a decade ago. He got caught with the computing bug now he is studying maths and computing at a top university. It makes me proud to have steered my nephew’s pastimes into a lifelong passion

174356543,"My first psyche ward was like a resort. If I hadn’t been out of my mind it would have been the best vacation of my life. The food was good, most of the people were either friendly or let me alone. Some chick wanted to make out with me, I’m not quite sure why it never happened but I felt flattered that she even asked. It was clean and new and kind of out in the country. A counselor took me jogging with him. I played a lot of ping-pong and pool and one night they set up a projector and we watched a movie. We walked to a park and played kickball; that was fun. I became pretty psychotic after a couple days there and was suffering but I used to sit in the back porch by myself in a chair that overlooked a bunch of hills and the weather was good and nobody bothered me. The funniest thing that happened was I almost lost my virginity to this older girl. I was 19 and she was about 25. We were alone in the exercise room at night and stuff was progressing but a nurse walked in and caught us. The nurse told 
me I knew better than that and I got dressed to go to my room and I had to walk past the nurses station. The nurse had told the rest of the counselors and I indignantly denied everything until one male nurse pointed out the my pants were undone and my belt was undone which kind of ruined my argument. If I’m being honest here, that nurse that caught us was fine and I would rather have slept with her than the other girl. I don’t think I was her type though. She probably wouldn’t have slept with me even if she was drunk. All that happened and I was only there about 8 days. A lot more stuff happened there too and I met people and most were friendly and it was pretty mellow there. Damn schizophrenia wrecked my psyche ward visit."

176057400,"10 years is a long time. If you feel comfortable doing so, I would talk to her about it. Maybe there is a reason she is unsure. Plus that gives you the chance to be very clear in your concerns about her experience with psychotic patients. And her the chance to address the issue before it escalates. Also makes it so she must address the issue. The way she chooses to address it should tell you about whether or not you’d like to keep seeing her. Additionally it is possible to have bipolar type schizoaffective. It is also possible to have this form of schizoaffective and OCD."

176057407,When I had psychosis symptoms from 16y.o. to 26y.o. I wasn’t at peace with my life. I thought my life was useless. At some point I tried to kill myself twice. My life wasn’t stable and I kept stopping my meds and relapsing. Now thinking about it maybe I would have been better if I never stopped my meds many times as I read its bad for the brain and after you need higher doses which cause more negative symptoms. Now I am more at peace with my new life.

Sure enough about halfway through the group she started digging in her nose and eating whatever came out. I was looking at her and I said to her so everybody could hear it, “If you stopped picking your nose and eating it, people would like you better.” I was just trying to help but everybody froze for about three seconds and there was dead silence.

In hospital I thought one of the nurses represented the devil. He was handsome suave kind looking and it seemed really odd that it would just turn out that I had a handsome nurse in the building. I’m not gay, but you could tell the guy could’ve modeled at some time in his life. I was super sure he was harming someone when he entered with another patient alone in like this sort of side conference activity room. Anyway the look he gave me was that he was probably a little scared of me and curious about my well being. That’s pretty much when I realized that I need to listen to these people very carefully because I was don’t want anyone to feel threatened by me."
176057478,"I was in two hospitals within three months when I was 14 for symptom onset when I was 13, and I was diagnosed with psychotic depression, but I refused to believe that I was psychotic, and so did everyone around me, so I sort of ebbed and flowed and stumbled my way through high school for 4½ years until I was 18 and almost completely broke (that was in December 2017) and was living in an ever-evolving delusion. I was hospitalized 3 times in 2018, and was stabilized in December 2018, and this year, I’ve had a few close calls, but I’ve managed to stay out of the hospital. In the beginning, I had enough insight to know that something was wrong, which is why I didn’t consider myself psychotic, but my life would’ve been so much easier if I had just listened to my doctor in the beginning and taken my meds. I don’t know for sure if you’re psychotic or not, but please seek help now. You need to tell your dad what’s going on so you can get treatment."

Some of the track’s melodies in the song I assembled were written with patches from Reason, some of its rhythms were written with patches from Ableton Live. Noting then the difficulty of the sound, that it’s a challenge to correctly hear velocity editing, which points to developing velocity methods as a frequent snafu, where instead of letting velocity accelerate, or decelerate, tracks sound broke. Actually, there are basically multilayers, and with multiple e.q. channels. So three things that are audible are velocity editing, multilayering, and E.Q. channels. Quantum Cryptography became a choice for the title of the track, casually, when I happened upon it in a search engine, that it is less degenerate. Each time I read it I’m a little confused, though for a sense of finality it could mean a form of encryption in quantum mechanics between two parties."

176057582,Sz can be hard. Lots of thoughts that aren’t good for you or others. I’d say if you don’t act that is probably a good thing. I’ve met others before with command hallucinations and such which is problematic. I think you know what is good and what isn’t. That is a good way to be. All’s I’d suggest is that if it bothers you too much seek some therapy. Bouncing ideas of someone else can be beneficial.

176057595,I do notice a difference in the quality of my sleep when I stop taking Risperdal close to bedtime. I think it’s mainly because it causes me a lot of sinusitis and inflammation which makes me snore more.

I feel protected by my isolation, and I have no expectations of me and I like that. I have misplaced my trust in people too much in the past, and I am better off alone."

176057618,Okay. Thanks for the tips!

174356608,"I’ve always felt odd or different since maybe 2-3rd grade. Even younger, I was different. I would do experiments at home and try to make potions and stuff lol. I think I had some autism growing up but a mild case. When my parents divorced, I had severe anger issues towards my mom. I blamed my parent’s divorce. My dad was rough on me and still is. After a field trip in 4-6th grade (I cannot remember) I got really, really sick with the flu. I started feeling and being different. I had zero friends until community college. I was a loner since 4th-5th grade. It was so bad I rather not talk about it or relive the experience again. I noticed severe cognitive decline at age 22 while at university. Before then, I noticed even 1 energy drink a day caused more impulsiveness and worse working memory. The more water I drank and the more I exercised, the better my memory and overall cogntive profile. I think I used the drinks as a coping skill and a way to self-medicate my emotional issues growing up. They 
never helped or improved my situation; just made me broke and worse off. They still do. Not sure why I drink them except I’m stuck in the past and have an extremely hard time accepting and living with my condition. I don’t know if this is true as people say it doesn’t exist, but I might have had a superb memory growing up that borders photographic memory. I think it’s not true or real in my case because I struggled memorizing lines for speeches growing up and I had to learn how to think being a kid. But my memory was really, really good growing up. I’ve read some people or savants or OCD-type people can remember every day, every second of their life. Mine was never like that, but I could remember a lot like exact conversations for months or years and my mom would forget a week or two later lol… There were some drawbacks to these gifts like lack of eye contact, poor social skills, no friends, and sensitivity to light and flourescent lights to name a few."
176057625,How long have you been taking it?
174356615,"There’s news about how a schizophrenic mother and a completely sane father abused their child, and I feel like as a person who is schizophrenic, I’m not much different than someone who abuses someone. I feel like I need to bear the struggles of every person with schizophrenia on my shoulders. I was abused as a child but I don’t feel much different than my abusers who abused me. Every time there is a news about someone with schizophrenia doing something wrong, I feel like I need to carry that crime with me. Forever. Just makes me feel super guilty that I have this illness and so many people are getting hurt because of it. I just feel like I need to carry every burden (yes, all crimes done by schizophrenics in Korea) on my shoulders and carry that shame and guilt. My heart hurts. I’m a horrible person even though I’ve done nothing wrong."

176057628,I can’t say that I have been abused sexually. But abuse I have received plenty. Right from when I was four or five. And the trauma continues till this day. I am now over fifty. I can thus in a way relate to people who suffered abuse. No matter what kind. The bad part is that you are too young to fight back. As people grow older the frustration manifests itself in many different ways. Horrible…

And take a lot of solace, Nobody judges you poorly especially right now; you are no longer having detractors(if that were possible previously) in a place where they might have thought to themselves you were fishing for compliments… I for one don’t think THAT especially now; so maybe your post served a purpose there… But try this perhaps and if you find yourself in needs, publish it somewhere - with a creative caption(the ear), lol.

174356617,The fact is years back when you took Abilify you had less negative symptoms but its not due to ablify alone instead at that time you actually had less negative symptoms and over these years your negative symptoms worsened. If ablify helps you to reduce negative symptoms why not try ablify now also. I think it won’t bring that same effect you got at that time.

Some disorders put a person in extreme physical and mental pain until they die. Compared to having sz alone without physical stuff, organic brain diseases can be very awful. For example, fatal familial insomnia causes someone to hallucinate due to lack of sleep, and cause behavioural changes. Then, the person goes into dementia and later death. It’s absolute torture."

176057677,"Using my cognifit assessment which measures out of 800 Working memory = 427/800 = 47% better than me. _NAME_ has received a high score in the area of working memory, which refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks. Example: When you’re at the grocery store, you realize that you left your credit card at home and only have $50 in cash. You look at your cart and add up the price of all of the items that you have and remember the total. You then realize that you can’t buy anything else and go to check out. The high score comment is an exaggeration. Bad ones are : visual short term memory 35/800 96% better than me _NAME_ has received a low score in the area of visual short-term memory, which is the ability to temporarily remember a small amount of visual information.

176057683,Trust the doctors. They go to medical school and study psychiatry. Part of what they learn is how to diagnose someone with a mental illness correctly.

176057694,It sounds like you’re looking for a way to feel important. That’s a trap of psychosis for some. It can offer god like importance . When I was first hospitalized I felt like I was the center of the world. I’ve never forgotten that feeling. But this feeling of importance is just a dangerous illusion. I hope you’ll be able to see through it.
176057695,What’s your dream?
176057696,Today’s hasn’t been productive for me tbh. Quite bad of an effort.
176057697,While under psychosis I have been both a God and following God. Nowadays I deal with it the same way as I deal with any other “visions.” Is it useful? Does it impair my daily living? If it doesn’t meet both of these criteria’s then I just ignore it.

174356634,Schizophrenia itself causes this. I had cognitive symptoms years before my sz diagnosis. Also there is no way to find out if its the meds since the patients also have schizophrenia at the same time. My experience with cognitive symptoms way before taking any meds indicates that its the sz that causes permanent brain tissue loss and not the meds. Sad but true.
174356630,"This mental illness is so difficult. I know that I don’t want to be on medications when I feel really energized and I like the feelings that come with it. But then it never stops. I can’t sleep the energies keep building and I have nightmares and tactile hallucinations. I got too deep into my thoughts and after about three days I realized why I am on medication. The benefit of abilify seems to outweigh the risks of not managing my illness. It seems to stop it from progressing or becoming more severe, it turns my nightmares into vivid happy dreams and makes me lucid dream. Last night I dreamed I went into an elevator that turned into a time machine and I was in another place it was 1974 not sure why but it chose 1974 and then I was trying to get back into the machine and go somewhere else more fun but then I woke up. I have too vivid an imagination and I am too creative, I believe the consciousness does survive death but it does not have to be something superficial or apocalyptic or religious. I
m going to try and spend less time with religious material because I read revelations and I think it triggered my apocalyptic thinking. The worst of it is my subconscious mind is so powerful that I can believe all these magical things that I know I am not consciously designing, but that if the energy goes wild or off/imbalanced it gets worse. There is no easy way to explain it. It would be nice to have the best of both worlds: the heightened awareness and creativity without the crashes and seizure-like nightmares. I like things to be solved and understood. Consciousness itself is a mystery in many ways and maybe that is why I have so much trouble understanding a disease that impacts my conscious perceptions."

176057712,"You hang around long enough you’ll see that for most people diagnosis changes over time. It’s just how you react to meds and the progression of the disorder. I tend to think, Like many, that it’s a spectrum. Bi polar and sz are on a relative spectrum so we all fall along that line but it can be different for sure. You know your symptoms better than most so you’ve probably got a clue. It’ll all work itself out for sure over time which is the hardest thing…as well as finding the meds that work for you. Keep on top of things and translate to your shrink. It really boils down to medication for most folk anyways."

176057714,"Well if you want ropey supplement advice I can suggest you take a look at 5-HTP. But you can’t take it if you’re taking an antidepressant. 50mg a day should be more than enough. But this is something you should run by your doctor. It’s a serious supplement, it’s should be treated more like a medicine. https://www.iherb.com/pr/Now-Foods-5-HTP-50-mg-90-Veg-Capsules/317"
